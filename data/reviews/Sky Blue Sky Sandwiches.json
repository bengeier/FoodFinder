{"text":"I'm going to be upfront- I have no idea who Wilco is. But as a girl who grew up on a hog farm I can say their pulled pork \"Kingpin\" sandwich is among the best I've had in the city. Super affordable with amazing bread baked in-house. I'm a big fan of ordering to go, eating a delicious cookie appetizer while I wait and then heading over to Christie Pitts for a mini-picnic. Makes for a perfect afternoon!!"}
{"text":"The staff seemed annoyed when i was in and it took 25 minutes to get 2 sandwiches. I wouldnt dock marks for the long wait in case the person was new but the general attitude in there made the experience uncomfortable so i wont likely be back. Sandwiches were good regardless."}
{"text":"Friends and I were recently in town for the Wilco shows at Massey Hall, so of course we had to make a trip to the sandwich shop whose entire menu is an ode to the band.

The space is small but comfortable, and it was busy when we went in. When we ordered at the counter (and paid), we were told they'd just gotten a lot of take-out orders and that it would probably be 20 minutes or so until our sandwiches were ready. We said it was no problem, since we weren't in any hurry.

We got the last available table and sat down to wait. And wait. And wait. We heard some Wilco. We heard the National. We heard the Avett Brothers. We heard more Wilco. We walked around and looked at all the posters on the walls. We looked at magazines. We finished our drinks. Finally, an hour and a half later, we realized people who came in after us were being served, and twice we were brought food that should've gone to someone else and was immediately taken away from us.

I had to go to the counter to ask about our sandwiches twice, and they seemed thoroughly annoyed both times, even though I told them what time we'd come in and that people who'd ordered after us had already gotten their food, eaten, and left. When we finally got our sandwiches, we'd been there for two hours and we didn't even get an apology.

My friends had the Bull Black Nova and the Dreamer In My Dreams, and I had the Airline to Heaven. The sandwiches were all good, but we could've seen an entire Wilco show in the time we had to wait for them."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this less than one star. We arrived for lunch and were the only two people in the place. We ordered two sandwiches and a plate of fries to share. It took 30 minutes to get our sandwiches and the fries never came. The sandwiches themselves were mediocre. Nothing I couldn't make at home. The only saving grace are the low prices and friendly staff. I wouldn't recommend this place and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went there today for a late lunch... and it was ballin'. The combination of ingredients in my sandwich was very thoughtful, a little bit quirky but... it worked. Oh man, did it work. 
To be totally honest, I'm not familiar with Wilco, or the hipster scene in general. I know, drag me out back and beat me, etc... but I still enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe of the place. 
I really dig how they make and press the sammies to order. Hot 'n fresh!"}
{"text":"Been waiting 2 years for something new to come along down here and finally Blue Sky Blue Sandwiches takes up residence at 333 King St.  
What promised to be a fresh, different, exciting and new lunch experience, unfortunately fails to deliver on most fronts.  While the flavours are there and the Sammie's are very tasty and made to order, some things just cannot be overlooked. 
Not the least of which is the time it takes to get served and in turn, get your meal.  Even when arriving at 2pm (well beyond the regular lunch rush), it took 22 mins from the time I walked in till the time I left with my half Sammie and small soup!   
There's got to be a better system, right?  Well... Order ahead sounds like that might help.  You'd think. Not so. You may actually save a few minutes but my experiences beg to differ.
Love the flavours and combos available, but the long wait times and large price tags leave a bad taste in this mans mouth."}
{"text":"Ive been here about 4 times and the service is friendly food is good and the music gives great vibes I'm a fan !!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty crap. They are severely understaffed on a Saturday, and I found two gnarly long hairs in my soup. It took 40 minutes to get a sandwich made. They also have the worst attitudes - rude service. Never go here."}
{"text":"Affordable and super delicious! We especially like Hey Chicken (SO much chicken). How to Fight Loneliness and Bull Black Nova. Great homemade bread and they don't skimp on ingredients. Also Vanilla and Cherry Coke stocked in the cooler!"}
{"text":"I may be biased because I can't eat the sandwiches (damn wheat intolerance), but Sky Blue Sky didn't seem special when I was there. Sure, there's the cute Wilco theme and fun sandwich names, but that only counts for so much. When I was there for lunch I grabbed a mint cucumber salad and pulled pork poutine. The salad had no mint flavour whatsoever and tasted like they had used a not very good bottled dressing. The pulled pork \"poutine\" was more like super saucy pulled pork on top of fries, with a teensy bit of shredded cheese -- definitely not cheese curds. And the worst thing? We ate in, but they still gave us our food in takeout styrofoam containers.

My dad loves the sandwiches here, so maybe one should just always stick to those. Prices seem reasonable and they do have a lot of variety."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of sandwiches, but needed a quick bite one day and thought I'd settle for this place.  And I'm so glad I did!  I had a sandwich that was stuffed with avocado, tomato and gooey cheese that was melted on using a panini press.  It was very filling and delicious.  My biggest critique is that soft drinks were pricey compared to the sandwiches, but otherwise, it was pretty affordable"}
{"text":"I cannot find the right words to say how much I love this place.

Maybe it's the memories I have being in this place with my friends, maybe it's the fact that this place is just one big awesome ode to Wilco. But I am not being biased when I say they make great, affordable sandwiches. My absolute favourites are How To Fight Loneliness and At Least That's What You Said. Also, try the peanut butter cookies. So good. So good.

Did I mention Sky Blue Sky is one of favourite songs? Maybe it is the Wilco theme that does it for me."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's hidden gems! Absolutely delicious sandwiches and soups, coffee is always fresh and tasty, and the team is awesome!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place to go before heading into Snakes and Lattes. Absolutely great food and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"I had the \"Dreamer In My Dreams\" roast beef sandwich and the girlfriend had a BLT with ham followed by a scookie (scone+cookie). Everything was delicious, even though my sandwich fell apart before I even took a first bite. Doesn't really matter though because the fresh bread and ingredients tasted great, especially for the price.  I think it might be best for take-out to be honest, because it was cold and we sat in one of the wood booths which wasn't very comfortable and felt a little \"claustrophobic\"."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The restaurant itself was freezing cold. We ordered two sandwiches and a plate of fries to share. We waited for our sandwiches for 30 minutes even though the place was empty when we got there - so it's not like they were busy. When the sandwiches finally arrived, they were bad - the kind of sandwiches you'd make at home and think \"meh, I tried.\" There were also no plates, no cutlery, no anything. The fries we'd ordered just never showed up, so we just left without getting them because we didn't want to wait. The decor is also really... non-existent. Unless you count dust on the tables as decor.    

Only upsides? The food is dirt cheap and the service was at least very friendly. But we definitely won't be going again."}
{"text":"Offers a great selection of very good sandwiches made to order. Super-inexpensive, made with love, free wifi. Opens most days at 7am. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"For Soup and sandwiches there is no better place!  I've tried 4 different sandwiches now and they've all been amazing!  (I highly recommend going with a friend and switching off half for half so that you can try all of the amazing options).  The soups are an especially good deal  The potato soup was just like my Mom's homemade potato soup... mmm. No yucky additives, just homemade goodness.  There are great vegetarian options too (Via Chicago- who would have thought- but awesome!)
If you're a student, its a great affordable option for some homemade comfort food.  It would also make a great place for a cute low key lunch date with nice private booths for chatting!
Also- tried this yesterday- email your order and its ready and waiting for you when you're in a rush.
So many good things to say about this place- you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Hard to speak highly enough about this place. Service is quick and friendly, the food is cheap (around $5 a sandwich) and delicious. 

Recommend the Art of Almost Sandwich - avocado, brie, and banana peppers. These guys really take pride in their sandwiches and a I try to stop by whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches.  Super nice staff.  Amazing prices.

This is my favorite sandwich store in Toronto.  The owner is so nice, and takes such great care with every sandwich.  It's not fast, but it's worth the wait.  The sandwiches and bread are delicious.  Interesting, but not overcomplicated.  The prices are amazing with every sandwich at $5ish or less.  I also love their soups and salads.  I recommend this to anyone who likes to pay reasonable prices for things that are delicious."}
{"text":"shockingly affordable gourmet soups and sandwiches. not much over $5, and only $2.25 to add a generous bowl of homemade soup. our party of three had the Via Chicago, Casino Queen, Wishful Thinking, a vegan cookie, and a nicely spicy pumpkin soup for dunking. everything was way tasty and our bill was $20!

counter service, but the dudes bring your food to you. and they're chill and friendly. they let us hang out, talking and enjoying their playlist, for over an hour, with none of the passive-aggressive fuck-off glances you normally get from cafe staff in this city.

great for takeout or hanging and people watching. can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food but shocked that it took almost an hour to make two sandwiches on a quiet Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Great prices, delicious and fresh. We tried the breakfast sandwich which we found to be really. The brisket was good too but not as good as the breakfast one. Brewed coffee is really good too, especially for a place that's not a coffee shop. 
Will come back again if I want a filling and fresh sandwich."}
{"text":"I want a place to get some work done and fill up my stomach, so I came here.
Ordered casino queen and two cookie.
Honestly. The food are really really disappointing. The bread is dry. The bacon and pork are stiff. 
The building is super cold.
A good place for student. But it will be better if the food is improved and the heat is empowered.
I sat beside the window, watched the Bloor street and get most of homework done. Super productive"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite on bread that is oh so fresh. At around 5 bucks a sandwich the price is fair considering what you get. I'm not sure about the meat options, but the vegetarian and vegan options are great (also a banana sandwich so fruitarians lookout). 

The casual Wilco atmosphere and super nice staff make Sky Blue Sky great for casual dates, hanging with friends, or taking your out of town parents to lunch."}
{"text":"Really good soup and sandwich place.  The Flu Chaser soup is full-on flavour, and really great.  Ignore the hipster overtones, and just rock the tasty food for a great price."}
{"text":"Went here with friends for lunch because we were hungry and didn't want to spend money at snakes and lattes (expensive sandwiches there). So we crossed the street and found this awesome hole in the wall sandwich place.

What to Expect
-AWESOME service, I cannot even put into words how welcoming they were to all the customers. They offered to move tables for us in order to fit the entire group (there were 7 of us) and made us feel so welcome. 
-Most sandwiches are $4.99 which is a steal for the quality you're getting.
-You order first, sit down, take a drink from their fridge if you'd like then pay when you're finished your meal.
-Overwhelming amount of sandwiches (I think there are at least 25)
-A Lot of vegetarian choices!
-They have a few couches and a fire place.

What I Ate
-Had the \"I'm the Man who Loves you\" Sandwich, Slices of smoked chicken topped with tomato, pickles, lettuce and ricotta cheese, a Chile cilantro and a red pepper spread for some spicy goodness. QUALITY=TIPTOP I couldn't believe I could love a sandwich that much.
-Most of us had a difficult time finishing our sandwiches, for $4.99+tax it is worth it.
-They also have sides and limited desserts.

I will be back here FOR SURE, it would be a great post workout meal and fulfilling lunch."}
{"text":"We started with high expectations, excited at the large number of yummy sounding sandwiches on the menu, but 45 minutes later we were still waiting for our order of 3 sandwiches, one side salad and wedge fries.  There was only one staff person who was taking the orders, manning the till, as well as making the sandwiches, so it's not surprising it was slow on a crowded Saturday at noon hour.  However, we hadn't realized it was only one poor guy when we ordered (there was a kitchen as well and we assumed somebody was in it), but after waiting 30 min or so, another guy finally showed up.  Things picked up in pace after that, but it still wasn't until after 45 min that we got one of our sandwiches, and then another 15 min before the other 2.  When paying I quite politely expressed my dissatisfaction with the wait; the response was 'we make everything fresh so it takes a bit longer' - my response was that an hour was not reasonable even for a sandwich made from scratch, to which the response was that 'this restaurant isn't for everyone' or something to that effect - ie. insulting me as an impatient customer as opposed to apologizing that they were short-staffed and things had unfortunately taken a bit longer than they should.  We were late for an appt not having anticipated this kind of timing for a casual joint. Whatever happened to customer service and common courtesy?   Making me feel like a jerk for thinking a 1hr wait was too long for a $4.95 sandwich?? and the food itself? the sandwiches were ok; nice variety but nothing special; the salad was overdressed; certainly not worth the wait or the sour taste left in my mouth, and not from the food...."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem on Bloor Street. For months on end I would pass by this place and would never bother walking in until one night my friends and I had trouble deciding on a place to eat it. That's when I finally turn my head, saw the lit place, and checked out the menu. 

At first when you walk into the sandwich shop, you're unsure of what to expect. Do you sit yourself or wait to be seated. But once you take a look at your surroundings, you could tell its a casual place. My suggestion, if you're with a few friends, grab an empty booth if you can. It's more private.

Sky Blue Sky is a small cute sandwich shop run by Chad and his wife. There isn't a lot of places to sit at (especially if you come in with a big group) so remember as soon as you get in, grab a menu from the counter and find a seat. Overall service is superb. The owners are very nice and they try to make conversation with you whenever they can (especially if you're a regular). 

As for the waiting time on your food, depending on how crowded the place is and how much staff is on hand, your wait time might be different every time. To ensure that your sandich comes quick, you can always pre-order it online (I haven't tried this yet but I do know a lot of people order their sandwiches ahead of time to eat in/take out)

Now comes to the food. I LOVE THE SANDWICHES HERE!  There's no doubt about it, the sandwiches are not only made fresh to order but are reasonably price, filling, and delicious! I'm the type of person that would never order a sandwich when I go to a restaurant or even have it for breakfast or dinner. I'm not a fan of sandwiches at all because they bore me. Sky Blue Sky on the other hand does not. I have gone to Sky Blue Sky for breakfast, lunch, and dinner before and I'm always satisfied when I leave.

You definitely have to give this a try!

Asides from Sandwiches, they also making splendid soups and potatoe wedges!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and was expecting a great sandwich since the reviews are very positive and the place is hugely popular.  I ordered half a Hey Chicken sandwich, which was just the right size and only cost me $5.  I asked for it on whole wheat bread. The chicken was pulled white meat and not processed, which I liked.  The flavour was nothing special. What really turned me off however was the soft squishy bread which became soggy due to moist sandwich fillings.  In a trendy place like this I was expecting a quality chewy bread.  If you like soft bread of the Wonderbread variety you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was sent a link to this place today; previously I'd never heard of it. Hours later, it's easily become part of my weekly schedule (I can see the future).

Attraction 1: The Wilco theme. Nice, a hook. The sandwiches are named after Wilco songs and there are some Wilco posters on the wall. Otherwise, the decor of the place obviously hasn't changed from whatever used to be in there. Maybe some bright colours on the wall would add a little extra oomph.

Attraction 2: Homemade breads and soups. BIG  PLUS FOR ME!! Soup & sandwich may be my favourite meal, and homemade is very important. Brown bread, zesty lemon white, cranberry cream cheese are some of the loaves up for grabs.

Attraction 3: Inventive sandwiches. I have vowed to try every vegetarian option on the menu - there are several. They look scrum-diddly-umptious. Red-Eyed &  Blue with mozzarella, tomato and basil leaves? YUP. She's A-Jar with almond butter and banana? I will be eating that. 

Today I had the One Wing, which has \"thinly sliced oven roasted turkey with cream cheese, cranberry sauce and a hint of stuffing.\" SOUNDS SPECTACULAR. I regret to inform you that it wasn't as beautiful as I hoped it would be; the bread was easily the best part while the turkey was grocery store variety and the stuffing most likely Stovetop. 

The tomato rice soup was the best part of my meal for sure. I've yet to try the pumpkin cookie, which looks divine but I'm too full to eat. 

The owner is SO NICE. I had a nice chat with him and he's delightful. I told him about my vow to try every vegetarian sandwich; I hope he took me seriously. The challenge is on.

PS: Keep your eyes open, the place is kind of hidden on the top level of a small plaza thing on Bloor. But it's worth a visit - huge sandwiches and c-h-e-a-p.
PPS: There's a breakfast menu, too. And muffins & scones."}
{"text":"A place you can easily walk pass and miss, but definitely a place worth to try. It's a place that I have been multiple times because of various reason:

1. Sandwich names are unique,
2. Prices are very reasonable,
3. Hearty food quality, and
4. Genuine good service (esp. from the owner)

SBS has just gained a customer for life! =)"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place. Sandwiches are very different from what you get in other places. I tried the Man Who Loves You sandwich and turns out that the man who loves me is very yummy! 

I loved the National Geographic collection."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the 1st time today and I have to admit it's one of the best sandwich I never had.
Only negative point: the wait."}
{"text":"Friendly workers with a hippy atmosphere. Great prices. All sandwiches under 7.00 but you might wanna add a side. Sandwiches are filling tho. 
Definitely recommend and I will be back"}
{"text":"A good sandwich sounds simple. Not so. 
I have tried so many places around town but have struggled to find a decent sambo. This place is the answer. They have a great selection of tasty offerings. 
It's really reasonably priced too. 
Go for the \"heavy metal drummer\"."}
{"text":"absolutely delicious
I had the avocado bree cheese !!!!"}
{"text":"Go up the stairs. Get a sandwich and play scrabble. It will cost you like 5$.

My sandwich was exactly as described and grilled. I don't know shit about Wilco, so all the song title sandwich names were just sort of weird. Maybe I'll listen to them now that I ate that chicken one with the pear and bacon. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"BIG!! That's the best way to describe the experience here. The sandwich was big, and the cookie was big. 

Let's talk about the sandwich - I had the blue sky sandwich. Big bread slices, big chunks of chicken, big slices of big bacon, with tomato lettuce and spivey mayo. What's not to like? It was delicious and a little messy.

The cookie was peanut butter and chocolate chip. It was very big and sweet. Honesty with the sandwich being so big I am not sure that I needed the cookie but on the other hand, yeah I did.

And especially because the prices are reasonable I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I had a Hey Chicken sandwich as an early dinner and I don't think I'll be hungry at all later tonight. That was a monster sandwich and delicious too. What blew me away was the fact that it was not messy despite the amount of stuff between the bread slices. Everything was well cooked and the bread was delicious. If I have to complain about anything it's that it took longer than I expected to get my meal. Not a big deal considering how fresh it tasted and how filling it was. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My fave - How to fight loneliness!
Gets really busy around lunch time, long line, long wait. The sandwiches are good tho!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place in the city, in my opinion.
I don't think there's a thing on the menu that's over five dollars & all the sandwiches I have tried there have been both excellent, and filling. There is an EXTENSIVE selection of sandwiches, including many vegetarian options. They also have soups of the day and salads, and drinks. Their sandwiches are works of art.

Their staff are friendly and nice. Their sandwiches are delicious and SO inexpensive. And, for bonus marks, you can email them your sandwich order and they will make it and you just pick up it up. A homemade, delicious, customized sandwich.

A +. Will most certainly be back. I was thoroughly impressed!"}
{"text":"Apparently all you need to be called a good sandwich place is to have a snazzy catchy business name, with snazzy catchy menu and a good location.  I unfortunately fell for this trap from reading reviews about it online from a different site.  My girlfriend and I after I got her all excited about it ... but only to be disappointed.  

We ordered a pasta salad, \"Hell is Chrome\", \"Dreamer in my Dreams\", \"Kingpin\" and \"Rising Red Lung\".  All of these items can effectively be summed up using one word - bland.  The ingredients chosen were cheap cuts of unseasoned meat, dry tough pulled pork, greasy beef, and improperly drained tuna.  How can you call yourself a sandwich specialty place when you're serving packaged roast beef??

The service was very slow, and the coffee was extremely watered down.  The only good thing was the cheese bread.  The seat that I was sitting in almost catapulted me into my girlfriends lap ... it was not nailed down properly.  Anyways, I'm going to spare my fingers of typing anything else ... just ... just fly away from sky blue sky."}
{"text":"Sometimes I dream about Sky Blue Sky. That's how good it is. I've been 6-12 times since I discovered it a year ago. That's a lot for me, given my proximity, student budget, and the fact that when I'm around on the weekends I'm usually hankering for brunch.

The smell and taste of the fresh bread, the grill marks, the dope ingredients, the staff, hell, even the names of the sandwiches (almost exclusively named after Wilco songs, albeit one). One time it took them a long time to get our sandwiches to us, so they gave us a free salad. That's great service, exactly the kind I like to give to others myself. Another time, the server \"I'm the man who loves you .... and here's your sandwich\" and made me laugh when I needed a good one. They almost always seem to brighten my day when I go.

I've been working my way through the sandwiches, but so far my favourites are Wishful Thinking and Heavy Metal Drummer.

Tip: Hey Chicken, Kingpin, and Say You Miss Me let you add 3 extra ingredients at no additional cost - choose from avocado, roasted red peppers, jalapeño, pickles, bacon, banana peppers, tomato, sautéed onions or mushrooms. I always take the banana peppers because I find them really flavourful."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a homemade sandwich which is ten thousand times better than the sandwich you make at home, this is the place! The fresh bread, ingredients, price point, and kind staff make for a super pleasurable experience! We ate in and I got the mandarin salad and a sandwich (which I forget the name :s) and my boyfriend ended up eating four different sandwiches (glutton) and raved about them all. He's a tough cookie to please. Well, that was yesterday and this is today and we just talked abut going back now so.... yup. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I like the vibes, I like the idea of a soup and sandwich place, but the times I've gone into order food, I am overwhelmed with a smell that just doesn't seem right.  The sandwiches are okay at best."}
{"text":"Got the king pin pulled pork sandwich with the king pin potato wedges. Both were amazing! Great portion sizes as well very fair prices which you don't see enough in downtown Toronto. The cherry on top is how nice the two running the place were. Want to come back and try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"4.5 out of 5!

I gotta say - this place is charming. The guy who works at the counter is funny, friendly, and personable. It was a real pleasure interacting with him. I got a \"Hey Chicken\" to go and was not disappointed.

The Good:
1. Ingredients. They were fresh, delicious, and there were tons of them. It was a huge sandwich,
2. Price. $7 with tax for the sandwich I had and it was loaded with chicken.
3. Service. Smiles, jokes, conversation - this is new!

The Bad:
1. Basic. Really the only negative I can give is that it is a pretty basic place. There is nothing super interesting about it.

Great value, service, and food. Check this place out if you're in the Annex.

Tip: order ahead online as the wait can be extremely long."}
{"text":"Discovered this little place by accident when I was on one of my trips to Toronto to wander around the city.  I came out of Honest Ed's and was walking by when I realized I was hungry and discovered the place.  I wasn't disappointed!  I had one of the tastiest sandwiches I had ever eaten there! I will deffinitely be back if I am ever in the area again and want to go for a cheap and tasty bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a hankering for sandwiches so we decided to give this place a try.

I had the egg salad on wheat, hubby had the cure for loneliness, and we shared the cucumber mint salad and a bowl of Senegalese peanut soup. We ended our meal with peanut butter and chocolate (vegan friendly) cookies.

Everything was super tasty. The bread on my sandwich was great. It had been grilled/pressed, so it was warm and toasted. The egg salad wasn't innovative, but it was a good egg salad. A simple sandwich, but that's really what I wanted to eat. The hubby really enjoyed his sandwich. I kept hearing \"mmmmm\" coming from his side of the table.

The cucumber mint salad was really good. It was sweet, vinegary, and crunchy. I've had a lot of disappointing cucumber salads in the past few years, so I was so happy to finally find one that was exactly what I'd been looking for. The peanut soup was also good. Not overly peanuty, but a nice smooth flavor with a good amount of depth. super tasty. The hubby also loved both of these.

Cookies were also very good, but I couldn't finish mine after the feast of the sandwich and sides.

The owner is super nice and was a pleasure to talk to.

So  I recommend this place for good, solid, fresh sandwiches. I wouldn't recommend it if you're expecting fancy sandwiches. This just isn't that kind of place. Just good sandwiches made with care from tasty ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sandwich fan, but I was brought here for a quick work meeting and was pleasantly surprised. 
After sifting through a hefty menu, I had the Hell is Chrome (I think that's the name), which was an egg salad sandwich on a 3-cheese bread and served with tomato and avocado. 
I can't say much about egg salad sandwiches, but this was good and filling. Price was right and the butter tarts were tasty!"}
{"text":"How can you not like a place that has bacon and avocado at no extra cost? My only minor complaint is sometimes the sandwiches are the size of your head (which is awesome!), but they can also be kinda paltry at times. Other than that great spot."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER!! I dont know how many times they can mess up an order. Just because they always mess up my order i have decided to go with the most simple sandwich a grilled cheese!! There was basically no cheese in the grilled cheese, i actually wanted to take it back but because i was running into a meeting i didnT have the time to go back (and it takes them 30 minutes to do a sandwich anyways) and when i opened the sandwich - A DISASTER! This place is always inconsistent, last time i got a sandwich they forgot to put the avocado in, today when i got the soup i asked twice did you put a spoon in and the server said yes - there was no spoon in the bag.. One of my colleagues got the couscous and it smelled very bad - ans she couldn't eat it. Such a waste of my time and money never ever going back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places on Bloor West! Chad , the owner is a really great guy and boy can he bake a good loaf of bread. My absolute favourite sammie is the Casino Queen. If you love bacon, avocado and turkey this is the sandwich for you.

Other than the food, the concept of the restaurant really hits home as I am a huge Wilco fan. The walls are adorned with various Wilco tour posters and most of them are even signed by the band. If you don't know who Wilco is though don't fret, this place is worth visiting just for their creative sandwiches and sides."}
{"text":"Although the service may sometimes be a little slow, this is a great place for a quiet lunch. Although I don't think there's anything on the menu that's vegan by default, there are quite a few options that are able to be made vegan. I go with the avo/portabello one & it's delish!

They have great fries, and often also vegan options for soups. Drinks from the fridge are a fairly standard selection, but they have that nice Stewart's pop in glass bottles."}
{"text":"I just want to try the sandwich here.  It looks huge and delicious and there was a big line up when I was here last time.  However, the wait time for the sandwich was a little ridiculous.  I waited for more than 15 minutes for a sandwich and the place was not even packed.  I hope their sandwich will make up for the wait; otherwise, I won't ever coms back to this place again.  The sandwich I purchased was for $8.59 with tax which is kind of pricey.  The lady serving me had a stone face expression, and definitely very unfriendly.  I don't understand why it is voted to have the best sandwich.  

There were a lot of flies flying around the place also.  Flies are like, here I come food.  I took a picture of one of the flies. Lol!

The sanwich tasted okay.  It was proscuitto, blue cheese with asian pears.  I think the flavour combo works well.  I think I would really need to craze for a unique sanwich before I would ever come to this place."}
{"text":"So so so good. Can't say enough about this place. Always fresh. Always delicious. The place gets SUPER busy at lunch and therefore it can sometimes take a while to get your order, but that's hardly their fault. They're popular cause their food is so good. BTW, order the Kingpin. Best pulled pork sandwich in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've eaten! Generous with the portions and topping and tastes delicious! I can't remember the exact sandwich that I got (since I visited here about 3 months ago) but it was delicious. They had a band playing some live music, even though it was a pretty small restaurant with limited seating. It was a nice atmosphere and a good spot for a casual lunch time date.

I will by stopping by when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. They bake the bread fresh each day. Chad, the owner, is a lovely guy. It takes a few minutes to get your sandwich, but that is the price you pay for a fresh-made and piping hot. The One Wing is my favourite."}
{"text":"I was looking for a lunch spot in the area and this one got great reviews so we decided to try it.  I have mixed feelings but I will say I'll go back to try it a second time.

I had a hard time picking a choice because there were so many.  I was hoping for a soup/sandwich combo but none of the daily soups interested me.  Instead I chose the Hey Chicken sandwich, and my friend an apple/havarti one.  Hers took much longer to make than mine, despite her ordering first.  Mine was good but had too much chicken (yes, it's possible) and not enough of the rest of the ingredients.  I might as well have been eating chicken and bread. 

Overall, it just didn't taste great but I understand that it's popular and likely deserves another shot."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of sandwich places (because you can't really mess a sandwich up), I didn't have a lot of expectations from this place. I heard about the location from my coworkers. We work across from the Distillery District so the location was quite convenient for us. 

They had a wide selection of grilled sandwiches with what seems like endless possibilities. Personally for me, I don't like to eat any other deli meat besides Turkey and I wasn't feeling Turkey today. However, the ELT caught my eye. It was a vegetarian option. What I received was disappointment. The sandwich took what seems like a million years! I ordered a veggie sandwich. It should be fast. It took a really long time for it to come out. Another note, the sandwich looked like a disaster, things were falling out everywhere. 

Besides the sandwich, I also got a soup, clam chowder to be specific. It tasted good but it lacked potatoes and actual clams. The half sandwich and small soup was $7. It was considered cheap by Canadian standards but for me, it was on the much pricier side. 

I probably wouldn't return here since my coworkers got meat sandwiches which they both said was really salty, which has high sodium. I like my sandwiches much healthier."}
{"text":"Been here several times. The food is good and its fresh but I haven't been crazy about their bread.  I decided to try another sandwich one day, so I came in and ordered the one which was a tuna melt (i forget the exact name of it) and spinach salad.  The sandwich itself was terrible.   It was dry, I mean the tuna had no dressing, and cheese inside was mediocre, I don't know if it was cheddar or what, probably not high quality cheese in any case.  Their bread (which was plain white) also dry and the crust was burnt, it had also been excessively flattened by the sandwich press.  I've had burnt crust on several previous occasions which makes me hate their bread.  But this sandwich I ordered was the worst one I had at this location. I was disappointed.  I hope they read these reviews and make improvements to their food.  I like the idea of this place."}
{"text":"Right off the bat. The environment was unique. I went with black bull nova, it was a good sandwich, something had sweet but good taste to it. I wouldnt count it as grilled cheese but a good sandwich deserve praise. Semi filling and price would allow me to try to sandwiches next time and night fill me

I probably be back

The downside was the cookie, lack favour, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either"}
{"text":"We had heard this place was great and we were super excited to go. 

The staff were nice. Unfortunately the food was absolutely terrible. 

Yes, it is cheap. That is very true. The quality of the food was terrible. We got two different sandwiches and soup. The soup was extremely salty and tasted like it came from a cheap can. The sandwiches were just bad.

We never waste food and arrived starving, and literally could not finish what we were served."}
{"text":"Sky Blue Sky is a sandwich shop, or is it a restaurant, or is it a cafe? See, I'm a bit confused because my experience there could have been oh so many things, well, everything except encouraging.

On the recommendation of yelp, weeklies and hipster friends alike, my boyfriend and I decided to enjoy some Wilco-sandwich loving on a rainy afternoon. What better than a restaurant called Sky Blue Sky on a day that is all grey?

Well, first things first. If you're going to have a sandwich shop where people pay up front for food, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the food would be served within maybe a 10-15 minute window at most. 

If instead you decide to be a restaurant, it might be prudent to reflect on the customer service aspect of a restaurant and mention to customers that the sandwich they ordered would take over half an hour to make due to a backlog of sandwiches. 

If in these situations you do neither, and I sit there for over 15 minutes with my order not called, have to ask the staff member (still ringing up new orders and NOT informing any customers of the delay or even the customers still waiting) when mine is expected, and then having them forget also the soup I ordered which took about 20 seconds to ladle from a pot, you should probably rethink the organization of the establishment.

All in all I waited over 30 minutes for my sandwich, 15 for the soup when I realized that they weren't going to get it for me and that I was in here for the long haul.

And yet, this all might have been rectified if the sandwich was any good. But unfortunately, the bread (which IS fantastic) completely overwhelms the One Wing sandwich. I had no idea the 'Thinly sliced oven roasted turkey' was really just bland deli meat, while the cream cheese on the bread was barely a whiff and the stuffing pretty much nonexistent. If I wanted the bread alone I would have bought a loaf, but the sandwich was really disappointing. The 'We're Just Friends' was also extremely bland, the panini was flavourless, and again, the smoked chicken was really just bland deli meat with a tiny hint of roasted red peppers. No seasoning, nothing.

The carrot soup was delicious, thank goodness so I didn't feel like I wasted an entire trip, but definitely not good enough to return to."}
{"text":"I had seen this place on a tv show once a year or so ago and wanted to visit. Since i have improv  classes in the neighbourhood  weekly and i am searching  for places to eat, i came upon this restaurant  and remembered  i wanted to  try a sandwich so today was my day!

I like the small space it is very comfortable and the people working here are very nice and friendly. I found out before i left that the guy is named Mackenzie. I  wanted to try the sandwich of the day but they were sold out. So he suggested i try the kingpin sandwich  which is house made pulled pork on fresh bread and bbq sauce and cheese. And wow is it ever delicious! I even found cherry coke to drink!

I am quite pleased with this place and will come here again to try more amazing sandwiches"}
{"text":"Even if you don't like Wilco, I think you'll find something to like at this shop. I stopped in for a quick bite before a show at Lee's Palace and left feeling full and energized. I ordered the At Least That's What You Said and some potato wedges, my fiancé ordered the I Am Trying to Break Your Heart. The pesto on mine was top notch and the cheese was hot, but not burn-your-mouth-off-hot. Word to the wise: go in with $10 and an appetite."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place due to a recommendation. This place has a great old-school cafe vibe, down to the picnic tablecloths and handwritten signs. When I first walked in, the owner was very friendly in pointing me to the menus and assortment of sandwiches, soups and salads they had. I knew I had to try their famous sandwiches, so I ordered a casino queen (smoked turkey, avocado, bacon, and a balsamic sauce). The other sandwiches were equally as creative and appealing. 

The final verdict: although I enjoyed the bacon bits thoroughly, the rest of the sandwich did not stand out to me as amazing. It was probably the sauce that was a bit off, as I am more of a savoury sandwich person. My boyfriend actually thought it was the best sandwich he's tasted, so there's different opinions. I would definitely revisit to try the other sandwiches, or the other menu items (they have vegan desserts!), or even the same sandwich but with a different sauce."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!! I had the hey chicken and my boyfriend had the kingpin - not only was it so cheap but it was also massive and delicious!! You don't need to get the soup. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here twice and tried three different sandwiches. sandwiches are unique, delicious and a great price. Staff is friendly  and the place is laid back. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"2.5 came here on a tuesday afternoon.  quite busy long lines long wait tines.  they need more staff for.it to functiom better.  however the convept is nice quaint and quirky sandwhich soup salad vinbe with unique sandwhich names.
it also does well because of the area.  its next to george brown they offer that homemade feel..which os rare these days.  the staff drfinately works hard to get through the line... but yeah...seems like they need more hands on deck for heavy traffic times.

sandwhich was alright.  not overly impressed but willing to try other options and come back.
price was great."}
{"text":"tl:dr - w00t! I get to claim another FIRST! Anyhow, delicious sandwiches and soup with equally delightful names for their sandwiches that match the vibe and personality of the sandwich shop. If you're in Corktown and have a hankering for sandwiches - GO HERE!

They opened up two weeks ago, and not surprisingly they had a line-up that lasted for well over half an hour.  I was committed to getting their sandwiches after 10 minutes, because I am unimpressed with the lunch offerings around the King East area.

In the two weeks since they first opened I went there twice, and you're looking at around $10'ish for a full sandwich and small soup.

The first time around I had their \"Say You Miss Me\" Sandwich, which featured brisket, sauteed onions, swiss cheese and mushrooms. I definitely missed this sandwich...

In addition to the sandwich, I had their clam chowder. mostly out of curiousity.  It was tasty, butI don't know enough about chowders to say anything definitive about it.

The second time around I had their \"We're just friends\" sandwich which had smoked chicken, swiss cheese and sauteed onions along with a red pepper pepper spread.  A friend winning combo... if only we could be more than just that..

To top it off, I had their tomato basil soup - delicious and hit the spot.

If you're ever in the area and have a hankering for sandwich and soup, Sky Blue Sky sandwiches is a sandwich powerhouse that you won't soon forget."}
{"text":"To get the griping out of the way: it really isn't made clear if it's table service or not; my companion and I were told (very kindly I might add) to take a couple menus and choose a seat, and from then on we sort of tersely waited, unsure of whether to go up to order, or start playing Clue or chess until someone decided to come over (the small bookshelf was pretty well-stocked also). So, not a full table-service place, but more a sandwich shop with places to sit that does a little something extra.

Hang on a tic. It's a SANDWICH SHOP. Ergo, graded on its sandwiches above all else, and they are outstanding. The entire menu will run you from $3.50 to $5.50 at the most, for in-house bread baked daily and great ingredients tied together with a thematic flair. I've given up on remembering the names (I love Wilco but not nearly as much as these guys do); my sandwich had avocado, bacon, roasted turkey, and the best balsamic-tossed sweet onions I've ever had, on fresh whole wheat. Excellent. My companion had what amounts to a salad nicoise sans lettuce on a three-cheese white bread which the owner spent an excited minute or two explaining WAS the best bread pairing they had. Bread pairing; he used that phrase. Gotta love the passion. And the sandwich was incredible, if a bit worrying on the sodium-content front. We almost ordered a second to share; my jaw was actually on the floor after she graciously gave me a bite. And stealing a second and third when she wasn't looking.

I'm a firm believer that Carla was the worst technical contestant on Top Chef, period, but somehow she made the final episode by 'putting love in' as her secret ingredient. Minds out of the gutter, folks. Having enthusiasm about what you're putting in people's mouths....ok I'm not making this gutter thing any easier. Being excited about the food you're creating makes a difference. It adds to the level of care in execution, and the sense of failure when it doesn't hit; these guys care about their sandwiches very, very much, and it seems they want everyone to walk through the door to have the absolute best they can offer. It's refreshing and well executed and probably the best place to get a sandwich in Toronto. There, I said it.

For trivialities; the space is clean and inviting, wood paneling prevails. The booths are of the high, private, and cozy variety and the lowered 'lounge' area has amazingly comfortable chairs. They have books and board games for those planning to stay awhile (no doubt inspired by Snakes and Lattes just down the street), and one of the best indie-cred playlists I've ever heard, avoiding being pretentious, which is definitely difficult. The 'table service' is rudimentary at best and it's easy to tell they're not equipped for it (by which I mean glasses, plates, and placesettings; they DO have tables, duh), but I think this serves to add to the cozy, relaxed mood. 20% of what goes in the tip jar goes to charity; it doesn't say which one but I'd assume it's something Wilco advocates.

When you get down to it, this is an awesome place to get a very well-made sandwich from people who really care about the sandwiches and don't really care about making money."}
{"text":"Too much hype over this place. There are only a few places to get a decent meal in the area. But I would not recommend this one. The wait was just too long that we had to change our order to take out. We were on our lunch break (30 mins) and it took longer then that to just get our order. They just don't seem very organized and know how to handle large rush of people who need to get in and out. My friend ordered right after me and he got his food 15 mins after me. He just ordered a veggie sandwich. We both ordered a sandwich and soup combo and the soup was disappointing. No heartiness or ingredients...it was just...liquid. Not worth the price. Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Love me some Sky Blue Sky. Been a while since stopping into the Annex location and found myself in the King St East stretch this weekend and had to stop in. While I'll admit that the pulled pork wasn't as delicious as I once remembered it to be, it was still a tasty and well sized sandwich that met my lunch needs.
This location is obviously newer and cleaner, and I will say that I enjoyed the live musician they had performing in the store while I nom'ed away on my sandwich. An all around pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork wildcard winner! I'd go so far as to say that its one of my favourite pulled pork sandwiches in the city! I can't put my finger on exactly what was going on with it. It had a sweetness about it but still a salty, smokey, and almost buttery flavour in the mix. Completely different from some of my other favourite pulled pork sandwiches, but great for that same reason as well.

The Chicken Sandwich I also tried was good with a really generous amount of white meat chicken breast in it, and believe it or not, actually tasted perfectly good as leftovers the next day (bread items are usually a risk for reheats).

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the potato wedges were a let down. They are like double thick scalloped potatoes that had been deepfried, and were super greasy. Sad face to those."}
{"text":"Quick update: I've come here a few times now and am very happy with the consistency in quality of my sandwiches. Their soups are amazing and hearty.  Tip: try the pumpkin cookies, great end to your meal!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to their hype! The ingredients are all fresh and prices aren't too bad considering the quality of the sandwiches and salads. A must go!"}
{"text":"MmmMMmmm, had the Wishful Thinking and Dreamer In My Dream today and it was deeee-lish (my friend and I shared each others). The latter was impeccably flavourful, like WOWzers! Fireworks in my mouth, y'alls. And the former? A more subdued but ever so pleasing to the tastebuds (avocado *heart*). 

Chad was incredibly kind and made small talk to us while we paid our tab. We also managed to nab a free scone on the way out, hehe! (It was a slow day, :P.) Yummy.  I'd love to come back to try the other sandwiches and definitely a soup!

Sky Blue Sky Sandwiches also looks like a great place to hangout. They've got a fireplace! And couches! And rather secluded compartments if you'd like more privacy. There's a lot of light coming into the space so it's very, very welcoming. You can also people watch, :). 

Apparently, if you order online (check out the SBSS website for their menu) there's a 5% discount (this is according to BlogTO). Get at 'em! \"Email us your order and the time of pickup at sbs_sandwiches@yahoo.ca and we will have a fresh sandwich waiting for you when you arrive.\" Does it get any better than that?"}
{"text":"I had the best sandwich I've ever had here. Though, to be fair I'm not much of a sandwich person. But like, it's a Wilco themed sandwich place, so really, it was bound to be entertaining/neat at least."}
{"text":"I came in because I was a fan of Wilco. It's as simple as that.

I didn't expect to have the best sandwich-shop-experience in Toronto. But I did. The staff is casual and friendly and the sandwiches taste great! Did I mention that almost everything on the menu is less than $5.00? That just makes it all the more sweeter.

The staff did take a while to put my sandwich together (10 minutes) but it was definitely worth the short wait. I would recommend this place to just about everyone.

By the way, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot = great album. Go listen to it."}
{"text":"I tried Sky Blue Sky for the first time the other day, and unfortunately, the experience was less than stellar. I bought the sandwich/salad combo. I chose the pulled pork sandwich and the chick pea tzatziki salad. I took one bite of the salad and knew it had gone bad. I asked for a new salad, the employee looked skeptical but let me choose another salad with a smile. I picked the couscous/sundried tomato salad and, well, it had gone bad as well. 
I didn't even bother to ask for another - I just threw it in the garbage. 

On my way out, I saw the employee try the salad I returned. She made a sour face and immediately threw it out.

Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"HEART HEART HEART! Went here with my valentine, amazing choice since we both have fond memories of the Wilco concert (Abbas is involved in this also, he was attached to a bottle of wine at the Hard Rock Cafe while we waited around for the show to start). Wilco is one of my favorite bands - if you are also a fan, this place is AMAZING. 

They have scrabble :) and national geographic for you treehuggin hippies to enjoy. Scrabble sucks for me, I'm a FOB hellooo.... but it was fun nonetheless.

I ordered the Airline To Heaven, which is:
A couple of \"froached\" eggs with some bacon and mushrooms. With some tomatoes, avocado and cheddar cheese on three cheese bread. (kind of stolen from website, even thought I have no idea what FROACHED is it was just eggs). Delicious, so much bacon and such a nice contrast with avocado and tomatoes!! 

My booiiiifwiend got the \"I'm Always In Love\", which was ham and turkey with cheese in the middle. Don't tell him I said so but mine was better - his didn't really have any veggies or anything but meat and cheese. Still crispy and delicious.

This place made me dream about investing in a panini grill all night....

Everything was great, super cheap and tasty as all hell... plus WILCO!!!!!! HEARRRRTTTSSSSSSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were inventive. Good selection. But really they weren't amazing. Typically a long menu is hard to deliver on, and theirs is long. Too bad. I was really looking forward to this."}
{"text":"Sky Blue Sky is simply the best! 

This is an old time sandwich shop bordering the Annex and Koreatown. It's on the second layer so look up and be greeted by its baby blue and cloudy decor. 

Chad and his team take the time to build their sandwiches (lots of time, sometimes), and if this time is an issue for you it is very easy to email or phone in an order in advance and they will have it waiting for you in a brown paper bag. I often don't mind sitting and chatting in the cute shop while they build my sandwich. Time kind of slows down when you're here, which is one of my favourite things. Chad has an amazing memory and remembers a lot about his customers. It makes going here feel like a small town place and you always feel welcome. Everyone is actually so nice and if anyone ever talks smack about this city, just take them to SBS and show them who's boss!

I can't tell you how many times I've been here and how many SBS diehards I have recruited. I always recommend the Casino Queen for first timers, but this is only because it is my SBS kryptonite. Featuring sliced turkey, avocado, the crispiest of bacon and glorious, balsamic caramelized onions, the Casino Queen is a lady with some majestic powers. Their most popular is the Kingpin and sometimes if you go too late it's sold out. That's how fresh everything is here.

The odes to Wilco here are blatant and undeniable. Each sandwich is named after a song and sometimes if you're lucky you might even hear this song playing amidst their folk-alternative that so consistently graces their airwaves. 

There's always different soups and feature sandwiches to keep things interesting should one ever get bored with the 30+ sandwich variations this little shop offers. (I didn't double check that number, but I'm confident it's true). And the prices are so good, when I worked in the area I came here a couple times a week sometimes.

I hate to say it, but don't listen to the people who gave this shop a bad rating. It's simply not possible! This is a great, friendly and delicious sandwich shop with homemade breads and a variety of ingredients. I find it hard to believe anyone would dislike this place!"}
{"text":"It's not so much the WIlco-themed nature of Sky Blue Sky that attracts me, it's the humble demeanour that the place emits. Though the sandwiches are yummy (if simple), I usually go to catch up with owner Chad Comfort.

I first went to Sky Blue Sky last summer, after returning from exchange in Scotland (I had been eager to check the place out while away). When going up to pay for my sandwich, Chad and I naturally got talking about music, I mentioned a few Scottish bands I got into while I was away, and we discussed NXNE, and just like that, a new friendship was formed. Okay, okay, it took a few visits, but you get the drift. This man is what I like to call a \"gentle giant\" (did I mention his name is Chad COMFORT?) as he is very kind and caters to the needs of his customers (once allergies came up in conversation and he found out I was allergic to nuts- the next time I came in he confirmed it with me and then promptly cleaned off his knife to make my sandwich- awesome.) What I like most about Chad is that he was the first person to ever acknowledge me as a \"regular\" at a Toronto establishment. 

So, sandwiches. All loaves of bread are baked fresh each morning (call a day ahead if you'd like to order one!) and as a previous poster has mentioned, the ingredients are simple and no-fuss. After all, it usually is just Chad up there whipping these things up, and he's gotta make em quick! My favourite is the Casino Queen (A.M. album) - turkey breast, bacon, grilled onions and avocado toasted on whole wheat  bread, consistently delicious so I can always expect it to taste good. I'm kind of lame in the sense that I always order the same sandwich, but altogether there are 10 non-veg and 7 veg sandwiches to choose from. I've tried the basic veg equivalent to the C. Queen, Wishful Thinking (A Ghost is Born) and it's tasty, if you're into portobello mushrooms. But friends who have joined me here have always enjoyed their sandwiches too, be it the Kingpin or the Hoodoo Voodoo.

With the plain decor (Wilco tour posters) and simple seating, this place creates a very non-distracting environment, which is actually perfect for getting a little work done, especially without the obnoxious glow of a Macbook Apple logo haunting you at every turn of your head. Hearty indie tunes are always on loop here too... Arcade Fire... Beirut... and of course, Wilco.

No need to make Reservations here ( Yankee Hotel Foxtrot), just stop by, eat in or take away and perhaps stroll down to Christie Pits. Unwrap that red and white checkered wax paper, and sink your teeth into your Wilco song of choice- Either Way (Sky Blue Sky), you'll be satisfied. It's Just That Simple (A.M.)

BOOYAH (obligatory reference to The Brendan Leonard Show, which introduced me to Wilco in 2004-- those who know what I'm talking about, big props to you.)

{"text":"I really like the staff who run this place. The sandwiches are delicious and cheap. Keep it up."}
{"text":"One of my top lunch choices in this area, I've been here multiple times with other coworkers. 

I've had the Casino Queen, ELT, Kingpin, and the Sky Blue Sky. All exceptionally delicious, made with freshly cut bread for roughly $7. There is only one person as the \"cook\", so service was slow. Expect to wait at least 20 minutes if you order in person. Other than that, it's a great spot for fresh hand-made sandwiches at a reasonable price.

It's a cozy place to sit and chat as well."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are insanely good. I've had the \"A.M.\" breakfast one more times than not -- it's a super-packed frittata with bacon, avocado, onions, and cheese baked between bread. It's a no-brainer to start your morning.

If I don't hit the place in time for breakfast I tend to grab the ELT (veggie eggplant) or the Rising Red Lung (tuna melt). Both quality selections and quite filling. They have about 30 sandwiches to choose from, which can be a little overwhelming if you're indecisive like me. I would say half the menu is vegetarian as well, so bonus points for being veggie friendly.

I've also had some of their baked goods, soup, and coffee -- all very good as well, and the large coffee is massive even for a java junkie like me. Make sure to grab a frequent customer card -- 10th sandwich is free!

Only complaint about this place are the hours. Closes at 6:30pm on weekdays and closed on Sundays, which is the time I crave that breakfast sandwich most to help nurse a Saturday night hang over."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch or picking up food for a picnic. I got a massive sandwich and it wasn't that much money! So many choices. The staff were organized and nice!! I felt like I was buy from a nice family run place.  This isn't subway people. I will go back again and again.....So good!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the new King East location today. Cute name, but disappointing sandwiches. 

I got the How to Fight Loneliness - slices of smoked chicken, bacon, apple and honey mustard on three cheese white bread. First, the toasted bread was dry, white sliced bread. The chicken was only 2 thin slices of cold cut (I had imagined actual chicken or at least a thicker stack); topped with a few super thin slices of apple that were barely noticable. I did like the bacon and the ingredients are a good combination - just too little of everything, making it very underwelming, bland and not filling at all. Not worth my $6.77."}
{"text":"An oasis. Fresh and healthy (or not...your choice) food. Huge choice and willing to cater to needs. Economical. Clean. Pleasant service by kind folk run and work the place."}
{"text":"Dead on a Saturday night, my friend and I stopped by here for a bite. Really, I wasn't even sure it was open looking at it from the street.

The dude manning the shop was extreeeeemely chill. We chatted with him for a bit on our options, and he seemed to know his shit. They only had whole wheat bread available, and he steered us towards sandwiches that worked best with that kind of bread. The menu is long, so some direction was appreciated.

I had the Casino Queen on his recommendation, which was really great. Balsamic, bacon, avocado. A++ WOULD ORDER AGAIN.

We didn't intend on it, but this was the perfect filler while we were waiting to get into Guu. Come here for a cheap, good sandwich, then head to Guu when your number gets called for booze and noise."}
{"text":"I live near the west location and love it, so I was excited to see this one when I started working in the neighbourhood. 

LOVE the sandwiches, and love the prices, but the staff could work on being a bit more appropriate. The loud conversation 3 feet away from me about \"the guy who trained me at my last job was such a coke head dude\" while I read the menu wasn't really what I felt like listening to as a customer. Not the end of the world, but still a little off putting. 

**Note: I'm in my 20s and work in a relaxed environment so I'm not an uptight jerk. Those topics are cool to gab about in the back, just watch it on the floor. 

Still worth a visit though. Just keep your headphones in."}
{"text":"There are a lot of tasty sandwiches here that are what sandwiches are supposed to be, good & cheap! Take note, trendy hipster sandwich shops!"}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my office. I went here on the advice of my coworkers and I don't regret it at all. I ordered in advance because I was told there is a bit of a wait so when I arrived my food was ready to go. I got a Casino Queen and some wedges. Also added cheddar and pickles to the Casino Queen. It was soooo good. I sat in the corner and played on my phone while I ate. The place was pretty busy the entire time I was there. I think my total came up to $9 or something like that. Also there's no wifi. I liked this place. It's kind of unassuming in the Koreatown stretch but the food is solid. I think if you go in knowing -1. There's a wait. 2. It's just sandwiches not much else- you'll definitely appreciate it.

I would absolutely recommend and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I hate hipsters. I'll say it.

But Sky Blue Sky isn't just about the hipsters. It's about silly-cheap sandwiches and really great soups. The sandwiches aren't gourmet -- one of my coworkers described them as sandwiches like you'd make at home -- but there's not one over $5. The bread's homemade and fresh. And the soups - they are so good, inventive, and tasty, and only $2 with a sandwich. That's less than $10 for a stupid-filling sandwich, often pressed and hot and wonderful.

It's not all amazing news, though. The space is uninspiring, and there's not very much room for groups. We regularly have to steal chairs from other tables, and tables from inside booths. And it can take a while for your sandwiches to be prepared, especially if you're with a large group.

In the end, though, you get tasty sandwiches for ridiculously cheap prices, and have to deal with only a smattering of hipsters to do it. Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"Am I \"always in love\"? Or is that \"wishful thinking\"? 
Sometimes \"we're just friends\".... but sometimes he says \"I'm the man that loves you\"
Most of the time I come to Sky Blue Sky because this is \"how to fight loneliness\". 

Those \"quotes\" above are just some of the interesting signature sandwiches this place offers. I recently discovered this sandwich shop in Korea town through a friend's suggestion. And I'm so glad I found this place. For reals, if I'm ever lonely, I'm going to pick up a satisfying sandwich to be my friend. 

Most of the sandwiches are around $4.99 - what a steal! And soups are $2.99! The place is super cozy with an electric fireplace to warm you up, big tables, booths, armchairs to sit on, whatever floats your boat. 

Service is super friendly and accommodating. I didn't want my sandwich on a bagel so they changed the bread for me. Me and my friend had the Casino Queen and the It's just that Simple and we loved it! Will be back!"}
{"text":"An instant favorite.

Now, there's no more need to truck down to Greensboro for Sticks and Stones Pizza.   We have our own indie rock fast food shrine.... and it's stellar.

This amazingly friendly shop is tucked in just-out-of-the-field-of-vision on an upper step on the south side around Palmerston and Bloor.

We ordered a variety of sandwiches.  My favorite was the \"Wishful Thinking\"....  a wonderfully generous portion of fresh portabello and avacado layed with caramalized onions and served on thickly cut superfresh honey wheat bread.  Oh.  And it was pressed.    (I'm literally salivating as I write this.)

This is enough for a five star review.... but there's more!   Not only do they have comfortable seating and secluded booths... they also have free wi-fi, some of Flatstock's best rock posters and a selection of interesting reading material.

Sandwiches are not hard to make, but they're very hard to make well.   These guys seem to have a true passion for making sure that every customer who walks in the door is completely satisfied.

I'm going to be back here over and over again, even if they don't have a sandwich named after my favorite Wilco song.  (Yet.)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing not only is it inexpensive, it's also delicious and has gluten free bread!! I personally love \"Casino Queen\" and \"Say You Miss Me.\" It can be a little slow on service but so worth it. If you're someone who's always in a rush on your lunch hour maybe this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Stumbled into here on a Saturday while there was some live music playing. The service was wonderful and they were able to accommodate several food allergies, including offering to make a new sauce for a sandwich, omitting an ingredient that was problematic. What service! And shows how well they know their ingredients. The sandwiches were fantastic and the environment adorable."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches at a great price. One of the best lunch options in the area.

I don't go out for lunch often, because I am a cheap bastard, but when I do I am looking for something tasty, cheap, filling and not overly unhealthy. Of course not many places can fit this bill over all those categories but I believe sky blue sky sandwiches to be one such place.

I haven't tried all of their sandwiches, but I should. But the ones I have tried are great. All sandwiches come with an extra 3 choices of toppings. The brisket is amazing with pickles for some acid, jalapeños for some kick, and bacon for some extra crunch. The bread they use is like a mix of challah and Italian. It's white. It's soft. It's fresh. At the end they put all the sandwiches through a panini press.

File this place under tasty amazing lunches under 10 dollars. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I had gone window shopping and were looking for some food close to where she lived so we found this place, which one of her friends highly recommended. As you could tell by the name, this eatery specializes in sandwiches and good healthy quality sandwiches. The interior is a casual social house that is good for groups of people looking for a place for hanging out and having group meetings. You order your food at the counter just like in a mall food court but their system for ordering is pretty old fashioned, which I thought was an awesome blend with the trendy interior of this eatery. They handwrite your order on colored sheets of paper. 

I don't remember the name of the sandwich I got but I remember that it was meatless and had portobello mushrooms, guacamole, sauces and various seasonings. It tasted like it was freshly prepared on the spot and it was a perfect portion for a light eater like myself. It was warm and melted in my mouth. However, I found it had a bit of kick with the black pepper but maybe it's because I just never developed a taste for anything with spices. 

Pros:
Pricing was reasonable for the sandwich portion I had and the lady who took our order was friendly and seemed to love her job and was very passionate about their business. Also, the names of the sandwiches on their menu have hilarious titles.

Cons:
 It would be nice, however, if they had the option of having a sandwich combo with a drink and choice of side. Right now, all items are ordered a la carte. Also, this place closes at 8pm on a Fri night, which I found unusual for an eatery/social hangout that is located in the heart of a busy downtown Toronto area. 
 
Overall, I enjoyed our experience here and may come back some time to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you  have not been here yet, you are missing out. A huge selection of healthy sandwiches, soups and salads, made to order. Will please all dietary requirements, from full vegan to carnivorous.  (A nice surprise: they have the BEST hot dogs in the city!!) Just watch the hours - they are not open terribly late nor on Sundays. But with the number of condos opening soon nearby, I hope they will expand their hours."}
{"text":"Most excellent sandwich shop. Unbelievably cheap and surpassingly tasty. Friendly staff, comfortable dining area. Was trapped here with my girlfriend over grilled cheese sandwiches and cucumber salad during a pounding rain storm. Had a wonderful time. I cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Overrated!
Okay, so it is cheap, but I hate it when the inside of the supposedly hot sandwich is cold... why! Also the bread is a bit offputting.. I don't know why but it just doesn't sit well with me."}
{"text":"The place is located in somewhat of a quiet part of town where there aren't many lunch options. But once get to the restaurant, its packed inside. The people are friendly and they do a good job asking what you like and then recommend a sandwich. Prices are also fairly reasonable and definitely cheaper than financial district. Wait times are somewhat on the longer side, but not totally unreasonable. 

However, despite how others rave about this place, it didn't really do it for me. I respect what they stand for: hand made, non-generic sandwiches, but it really wasn't that tasty. I had the king pin sandwich with avocado. On paper this sounded like a great sandwich, but it didn't turn out to be great. The sandwich was big, but lacked flavor. The pulled pork was very wet and made the sandwich overall very soggy. It was difficult to eat; I had to eat it very gingerly to avoid getting it all over my shirt. Is there another sandwich to get that would change my mind?"}
{"text":"I'll save the Wilco references but reaffirm comments by  others who say that nice people work here. 

The pea soup was served hot and had a spicy kick.

The Dreamer in my Dreams (toasted jack bread with roast beef, marinated onions, peppers and cheddar..I dropped the tomato) was dreamier than any five dollar foot long and about the same price and minus the heavily processed crap.

The fact I can add a Perrier for around ten bucks total leaves me with a Sonny Feeling.
Alright..maybe one reference.      

OK, one more..maybe \"Go away Jared\" could be the name of their next album."}
{"text":"I walked in here one day for a quick bite to eat.  Very easy to miss if you aren't looking for it, and hard to tell if they're even open from the exterior. Regardless, well worth walking up those stairs to peek inside!

Once inside, I was greeted by some chill looking guys who seemed friendly.  They passed me a menu and made casual conversation.  I decided on the \"Kingpin\" sandwich (pulled pork), and was amazed at how good this $5 sandwich tasted.  Seriously....all the sandwiches... $5!!  The ingredients, including the bread were fresh.  I tossed it back with a rootbeer and went on my way a happy camper.

Considering the product and price, this place is a no brainer.  Go to Sky Blue Sky and get yourself a yummy sandwich, there are lots to choose from!"}
{"text":"i came in at 8:52 and they were closing at 9. The people before me had just ordered. They wouldn't serve me. I could understand if it wasn't just a sandwich place but seriously its just a sandwich place. If you work in the service industry thats part of the job."}
{"text":"Favourite place for a sandwich in the city. Great prices. The owner is one of the nicest people I have ever met."}
{"text":"Extremely disorganized after being open for so long, no efforts to improve process, poor management and lose orders frequently. Incompetent staff - at making sandwiches. I'm finally done with it..."}
{"text":"So so good! Freshly baked breads, amazing sandwiches! If you're a vegan or vegetarian this place is for you-- they have a whole list of vegetarian options! Also the prices are very fair and the food is incredible. Try the at least that's what you said and the kingpin wedges!!! My favorites!"}
{"text":"Service is really friendly! They make their soups and sandwiches from scratch, which I can appreciate. 

Everything--in-house or to go--is served in/on waxed paper and environmentally unfriendly styrofoam. Part of me dies inside when I'm eating soup at a \"restaurant\" and it's served in a styrofoam bowl with a plastic spoon. This is so wasteful.

Unfortunately, the soup I tried--though it sounded exciting and smelled delicious--lacked in flavour. Definitely didn't impress. It reminds me why I always skip soup at a restaurant.

The sandwich I had was pretty mediocre (Dreamer in My Dream, I think? The beef one). I would've made something much better at home.  The bread used isn't that high quality at all, and it's flattened and pressed all funny. Picture Wonder Bread in a panini press where the white part still stays somewhat white and ends up looking stale-like (toasted?) and the grill lines leave much to be desired. It's probably the worst pressed sandwich, visually, complete with random black charred bits. I've had my fair share of pressed sandwiches and this ranks among the worst, visually.

On the plus side, the flavour of the sandwich was pretty good. There was roast beef and corned beef in mine, with cheese. Pretty tasty. Presentation was awful, but it tasted pretty good. For $5 though--same price as Subway--it's hard to choose what I'd rather spend $5 on.

The air also had a faint smell of a mix of paint, beer and urine. Maybe it was the soup. Not sure. I didn't like it. Even someone else asked what the smell was and if it was the soup. It's an odd smell. It doesn't smell good, but not really bad either.

Even though it's cheap, you'll get a much better sandwich experience at a restaurant or at Sandwich Box.

As much as I'd love to love this place because the service is friendly and it's so close, I can't. I won't be coming back here again.

This place would get 2 stars but the guy was so friendly and they make everything from scratch and have fresh bread around, so that definitely works in their favour."}
{"text":"There's something about a place with a Wilco theme that makes it irresistible, but luckily Sky Blue Sky is more dedicated to giving you a good sandwich than it is to tickling your hipster bone.

All the sandwiches on the menu have names taken from Wilco songs, and all are made with TLC and a lot of thought, right down to what spreads and what bread would make the sandwich perfect. I had Hell Is Chrome, their deviled egg salad sandwich, on a deliciously sweet, spongy white bread that made it a lot less messy than I feared it would be.

I do have two quibbles, though: 
1. everything was served with disposable cups, plates and wax paper. We were told there's no room for a dishwasher in the back, but hopefully that will change. 
2. I was in a group of 8, and as a result it took quite awhile to get our food. But if you're prepared for that, grab a soda, take a window seat and watch Bloor Street go by. The sandwich will be worth the wait.

Aside from the menu offerings and a couple framed Wilco posters, there's little indication that the place carries a theme, which allows the food to take the headlining slot. Bread is baked fresh, and there's a breakfast menu as well. The owner of the place is a thoughtful and very kind man with a vision all his own.

I'll be heading back this week, and again and again in the future."}
{"text":"While walking down King Street, I could not help but notice this pleasant aroma. My nose was constantly sniffing and next thing I knew... I ended up at this sandwich joint! I really liked how they named all of their signature sandwiches (ie. \"How to fight loneliness\" - obviously there is bacon in it). It adds to the 'uniqueness' of the place!

I tried the Kingpin (Pulled Pork), Hey Chicken (Pulled Chicken Breast) and Say You Miss Me (Braised Beef Brisket). My favorite is the pulled pork as it is so tender and rich in flavour. Really great spot for lunch. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous! Will definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are hefty and they have great specials where you can pair a half sandwich with a soup. The ingredients are fresh and tasty and the combinations are endless. The staff is friendly, though the wait time can be exponential if you go at noon. I wish they wouldn't press the sandwiches for so long. I always cut my gums on the sharp, hard crusts."}
{"text":"There are a bunch of really awesome things about Sky Blue Sky. First off, I love Wilco, and the Wilco kitchiness does it for me it some strange ways. Second, the sandwiches are OMG-good. My favourite right now is the One Wing, which is like a full turkey dinner on a sandwich.

If you're really into bread, you will enjoy SBS. The bread is fresh every day. If you come in early in the lunch rush, loaves of bread are all over the counter, up and down the walls, and the place has that fresh-bread smell (something enjoyable on the new-car level, but definitely more edible). The sandwiches are huge and have some incredibly tasty things on them, like steaklike portabello mushrooms, pears, avacado, and all sorts of other cool things. On top of that, most of the sandwiches are $4-5, so it's a cheap lunch on top of that.

I've heard great things about the soups, but only had one myself (tomato parsnip). It was pretty decent, but I feel like it needed some salt. If I could have located a salt shaker, I would have been happy, but no luck today (of course, I didn't ask).

I regularly spend half my lunch hour taking the subway 3 stops to visit Sky Blue Sky. If you follow them on Twitter (sbssandwiches, I think), they tweet the day's soups. You can also email in your order and they'll have it ready when you arrive (handy if you're on a time budget and don't have time to wait for a hand-crafted sandwich to be hand-crafted). 

A couple of extras - they have all the good flavours of Vitamin Water - the pineapple one, and the peach mango. I haven't seen them anywhere else in Canada. And they have awesome gigantic chocolate chip scones, which, I overheard, have Ghiradelli chocolate chips imported directly from San Francisco. Quite delicious. 

To sum it up - they're my go-to place right now when I need excellent/comfort/tasty food. They're really friendly, so you should go give them a shot."}
{"text":"I had to go here because it's named after a Wilco album and they're one of my favourite bands. The sandwiches are all less than $5 CAD and they're served on unique, freshly made breads. Named after Wilco tunes and other songs, the large menu has everything from meat filled sandwiches to vegan choices. I ordered the We're Just Friends and the BF got the Casino Queen. I got mine with a spicy bread that give it a nice little kick to it. The decor is filled with Wilco posters and has cozy little booths. I would definitely seek this place out if I were in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Fresh and good quality sandwiches that are well priced. Love the salad portions and the cucumber mint salad is one of my favorites during summer times.
A gazillion of choices to choose from if you look at their menu.
Certainly can't be disappointed with their sandwiches and names to remember them by... From Kingpin(smoked and slow roasted pulled pork with havartion a sweet french bread) to its just that simple (which is a simple, but timeless sandwich consisting of BLT put on a cheese bagel and with some mayo).
A simple delightful sandwich on the go or to eat in."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, but don't let the fancy names and descriptions fool you. They are made with quite plain ingredients (deli meat, packaged sliced cheese) and they look exactly like something your mom packed in your lunch in grade 4.

I have lived nearby here for awhile but I have never been in. Sandwich shops just do not excite me.

I did have an online coupon which allowed me to buy 2 sandwiches for $5. I stopped in on my way home from work to try it out. Got a soup ($3.49) as well.

It's quite nice inside. The owner is REALLY friendly and chatty. He takes his time making the sandwiches, so I waited a bit as he was preparing some others first. 

There are some nice loungy leather couches, a few booths, free books to read and a few board games. Looks like a really good place to veg out for a few hours and read over a coffee and sandwich.

The menu has changed recently and there are new sandwiches (website still shows most of the old ones).

I tried \"We're Just Friends\" - chicken, swiss cheese, roasted red peppers, red onions and also a new one (with the word \"Sea\" in it) which was tuna w/ lemon juice, honey mustard, capers and tomatoes.

The first one was quite good, but the tuna one just tasted too much of canned tuna, not enough ingredients added to mask the fishy taste. Wouldn't recommend that one.

The soup was chicken & rice and very average."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sandwich (for the best price) in the city. As a vegetarian, I LOVE the huge selection of meat-free sandwiches they have, and all the substitutions they offer without hesitation and without extra charges. Do yourself a favour and pick up a sandwich here."}
{"text":"While the staff were kind and friendly, the items well priced and the restaurant cute, I won't be coming back to eat here again. 

The sandwich menu was overwhelming with two pages. I like options as much as the next but it took a long time to find something to eat and I ended up ordering off menu anyways (sorry guys! I just wanted a grilled cheese with bacon). I added bacon jalapeño and onions to a grilled cheese and asked for it on the cheese bread. My fiancée ordered the heavy metal. He enjoyed his food but unfortunately I took a bite out of everything I ordered and that was it (sandwich soup cucumber salad)

The sandwich wasn't on the cheese bread and the insides were cold. Bummer. I tried the soup and it was alright but tasted like it was from a can. Pass. The salad I was excited for, but it didn't impress. Chunks of cucumber with a blob of some sort if sweet and sour jelly on top and a lot for dry mint. Lacklustre. 

Like I said my fiancée liked his food and I sent him home with all of mine. I ended up taking a cab to Ravi's soup to get take out before work."}
{"text":"The casino queen was just ok. More flavor and better contrast was needed. Cheap and quick before board games at snakes and lattes"}
{"text":"Cute, hipster-y kind of restaurant. Good for lunch, as their prices are pretty reasonable (about $5-7 for a sandwich). Other than that, nothing too special - I had the Say You Miss Me sandwich which is apparently quite popular. It was pretty good, with beef brisket, swiss cheese, sauteed onions, mushrooms, and barbecue sauce. Apparently you can customize it, but I didn't know that when I ordered and the girl at the cash didn't bother asking me if I wanted to add any toppings. She seemed kind of bored/unimpressed, so I would say service was kind of lacking here. I came around 2:30 PM on a week day and there were a couple orders in front of me, probably had to wait about 10 minutes or so to get my sandwich. I don't think the sandwich was good enough to warrant waiting for a long time during the lunch time rush though."}
{"text":"I had the Say You Miss Me Sandwich, beef brisket, tasted amazing. Cost $6.50 and was a healthy portion, and you can add 3 toppings. 

The menu has a wide variety of sandwiches, some pastry options, and a friendly staff. 

Great place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Brace yourselves, hipsters: contrary to the recent press explosion, this place didn't actually just open. It's been around since October 2009. 

Yep, all the sandwiches are named after Wilco songs and there are Wilco posters on the wall. But this isn't what brought me here - it was the lure of 17 types of sandwiches on freshly baked bread, 7 of them vegetarian. I've been longing for a strictly sandwich place to open up to tear down Sandwich Box's reign as king of the roost for years now. Ike's Place in San Francisco, which offers 100+ sandwiches and boasts two hour lineups down the block (1888 reviews and counting: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ikes-place-san-francisco) comes to mind. 

I was a loyal Wilco fan for the first four albums straight - but when A Ghost Is Born dropped in 2004 I was no longer interested, and I've certainly never listened to Sky Blue Sky or Wilco ST. But I have always felt a sort of kinship with Jeff Tweedy as a fellow migraineur and fiery soul. If you've never listened to Wilco and want to, may I highly recommend Summerteeth (1999) and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002). The former is where my sandwich of choice \"She's A Jar\" (almond butter spread on slices of honey-nut whole wheat bread, topped with slices of banana and sprinkled with cinnamon for $4.29) got its inspiration. It's a great song and a bangin' 1-14 sold album of tracks. Acquire it.

Sandwich was tasty but a thick layer of almond butter is tough to eat and I don't recommend it when meeting up with an old friend to catch up. You'll struggle to spit out more than a few words at a time between peeling almond butter from the roof of your mouth. I shall choose another veggie sandwich next time. The tomato & rice soup with parmesan was beyond excellent. You know how I feel about rice in my soup (adore it), and along with a bottled Nestea my lunch was still under $10 (I believe $8.50 was the total). 

Ambiance needs some work - it could be cozier in here. Dunno what used to be in this space but I'm thinking Mr. Sub? I was hoping for more of a Green Room/Nirvana (minus the mice) or Tequila Bookworm vibe. Music (Coldplay, Klaxons, Ryan Adams) is pleasant, but please, crank the volume. I like a soundtrack while eating. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"maybe its the hype... but it was pretty good here.  i got the combo which includes a soup and half a sandwich... it just hits the spot for lunch. 7 dollars was not bad considering i get a big bowl of soup  

clean hipster kinda joint.  feels like an open cafe but instead of making drinks they are making sandwiches.  tastes pretty good... the carrot ginger soup i got was a little too spicy but tasted good.  everything tasted pretty good.   only downside is it does takes quite a while to make the food... its not fast food... they make your sandwhich for you right when you order.  a line up can build up very quickly because each sandwich turnover time is so high."}
{"text":"This place is a great! We stopped in because it was right beside our office. We came at the perfect time as there was really only a couple people in line. Just after we sat down, there was a long line. 

There were a TON of sandwiches to choose from. Their sides menu was fairly limited... but that is ok... 

Their salads looked really good. I ordered the veggie sandwich (last one on the menu) it was very good. Bread was toasty and the veggies inside were good. I ordered a side of the Mediterranean couscous. I could not believe how much they gave me. It was an absolutely ginormous portion... easily over a cup (and I ordered the half sandwich and side). Honestly though the couscous was only ok though. I wouldn't order it again. I will 100% go back and try another side, but sandwiches were amazing and everyone else's sandwiches looked just as good!"}
