{"text":"The fish and chips are great!  The fish is always cooked perfect and the fries are never too greasy or too crispy.  The prices are reasonable and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Malt N Salt has been in the area for over 20 years and there is definitely a reason for that- the fish & chips are unbelievable. We usually get our food to go, but there are tables for sit-in. The staff are friendly and are always willing to provide extra condiments. I've never been a fan of fish until I tried the halibut here. The batter is incredibly crispy and light, the fish is fresh and doesn't have that unappealing fishy smell to it. An order of halibut fish & chips is around 9$ but since the fries aren't that great, I usually get an order of fish by itself, which is more than enough for one person. I would highly recommend this place, even to those who are picky eaters!"}
{"text":"I ordered the halibut and chips dinner. Fish was light and fluffy. The batter was nice and thin. So fresh and fries were also fresh.  I enjoyed my fish and chips experience. The only suggestion is to have homemade tartar sauce and coleslaw. Definitely worth trying. I will come back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top choices for fish and chips. Unlike other fish and chip places, their fish is not super greasy and I always get it to go. The store is small and there is limited seats, however, they seem to be very clean. Try the shrimp and chips which are my fave!"}
{"text":"Fish is way too greasy. The quality has been decling steadily over the past two years and has got to a point where it is not enjoyable.....even if its the closest place to eat from our place."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips; however they are a little stingy with tartar sauce. I asked for extra and was given 3 in total."}
{"text":"I really love the fish and chips here, I definitely will be back. The fish and chips were not greasy, they were light and just the right amount of crispy."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best fish and chips I've ever been to. They make everything in house from cutting the fish portions to adding the batter. The fish is light and doesn't have that heavy greasy feel to it. The staff is super friendly and they have great specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you will never notice unless you live in the area, and even then there's no guarantee. I do have a friend who lives in the area and has for many years, but did not know this place existed. She took me to Pickering instead for fish and chips, but I have been coming here for years for my fish and chips fix.

I always get their fish and chips and I am never disappointed except the last time I found the batter to be a bit heavier and oilier than usual. I really like their fries when paired with a side of their gravy. I have had their chicken fingers in the past, but they are nothing special. They are a fish and chips restaurant first and foremost so don't expect other menu items to compare. I hope they continue to stay in business. 

And remember they are closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips here. I've had all the fish and chips in the area as I live 5mins away. Out of all the F&C restaurants in the neighbourhood this one is definitely the best choice you can make.

Although I prefer the chips at other places, the batter and portions here are good for the money. Keep note that its almost half the price of the fish and chips down the street!

Mon-Weds is $5.55 plus taxes for Haddock & chips (Nov '11)"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's very clean and like what the others say the fish is not greasy. Usually when I eat fish n chips the fish has so much oil it makes my body num. 

It's perfect here and the fries taste very fresh. 

The portions are perfect for dinner for me. 

If you like fish n chips this place is a 5 star! I just dont like eating this type of food often, hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Very tasty Halibut & Chips. I tried the gyro on a bun but found it a bit dry.  It needed more sauce.  I was disappointed that they no longer serve milkshakes"}
{"text":"Scarborough got it's name when Elizabeth Simcoe (wife of John Simcoe first Lieutenant Governor of Ontario) commented that the bluffs facing lake Ontario reminded her of the bluffs of Scarborough England.  Consequently, settled by a largely anglo-protestant population; the last vestiges of this original diaspora can be seen in the plethora of Fish & Chips Places. 

Malt N Salt Fish & Chips is probably one of the better examples of a Fish & Chips place in Scarborough.  Tucked away in a dingy strip mall surrounded by pot holes, this unassuming restaurant produces some of the best fish&chips in Scarborough.

The fish is not too oily, it doesn't have that odd aftertaste you sometimes get with fish which isn't fresh. 

The fries are done well, often at Fish&Chips places the fries go from ok, to inedible faster than a co-ed running from Ben Roethlisbergers hotel room. Here, however they remained good to the last bite.

The coleslaw was a little too creamy, I usually like it a bit more vinegary than creamy. However, it wasn't too terrible. 

I'd go again for Fish & Chips."}
{"text":"Best fish & chips I've ever had!

Not greasy and pretty large portions as well . . . I've had fish and chips elsewhere and paid a lot more than $7 and still nothing compares to Malt N Salt. Everything is fresh and made on the spot . . . just try and ignore the fish shop decor and fender-bender parking lot.
My parents like it so much we now have it Christmas eve."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area, and wanted something to go, so I tried it! The portions are good, the fish was very good!  Not too doughy or oily. I got the 1 piece Haddock, and the 
There are only 2 tables, so not a sit-down meal."}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips , always done perfectly.  Worth trying to compare to your favourite fish and chip spots!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more customers!
I have been eating here since 2004

Their halibut and haddock meals are delicious. One of the best fish and chips
Their fries are average.
All fish and chip lovers should try their food!"}
{"text":"I've read so many reviews for this place before actually deciding to take a walk over with my hubby to try their fish and chips.  It was definitely not what I expected when I walked in to find 2 little Chinese ladies working behind the counter to take our order and make our food.  

We ordered a halibut fish and chips and chicken fingers (don't ask me why I ordered chicken fingers at a fish and chips place.  :p)  We were the only patrons in the store so we sat on one of the few available tables and waited for our food.  

The fish came in a medium light batter, crispy and fresh.  The chips were ok.  What I really disliked was the little packets of tartar sauce they gave us for the fish.  I would have preferred the tartar sauce to have been made in house but I guess you can't have everything.  

My chicken fingers were the standard frozen variety which was also served with little packets of plum sauce.  They were tasty enough to fill my junky chicken finger cravings so I was happy.  

I would probably return if I were craving something deep-fried (you know we all get these)."}
{"text":"This affordable little gem is a bit off the beaten path but has tasty fish and chips with parking a plenty. 

Seating is limited but there's a number of options (haddock, halibut, shrimp), including things of the land variety... such as burgers. Service is friendly and quick. The halibut was good and plentiful.

One complaint, fries were the soggy variety and very under seasoned. Also the tartar sauce comes in little crappy packages and is cheap as they come  (read very mediocre).

If you're driving, pick up some fish and chips and head to the waterfront park nearby for a fun slice of summer."}
{"text":"9 times out of 10 we get fish and chips from here.

The batter is nice and golden so I'm assuming they keep the oil fresh.  The fish is always nice and tender and they don't skimp on the tartar sauce and malt vinegar.  The service is always good, too.  Nice and friendly folks!

We usually order the haddock since it's about a dollar or two cheaper than the halibut.  Honestly, I don't taste the difference.

I've yet to find another fish and chips place that's better than this.  If you have suggestions though, let me know!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on for years. I especially love the name..! It's like a perfect preview of your meal. :)
But really - the fish is crispy and tasty, the fries are a little greasy and delicious. I love how this place has survived (through different ownership over the 20+ years I've been coming) and still is relatively the same as I remember. 
The prices are competitive, and I've found if you want real halibut you're going to be looking at more than $10 for a 1pc meal no matter where you go. I suppose it's worth it, I never think that I really notice a difference until I get something other than halibut and I'm like...oh yeah. :) 
I hope this place sticks around another 20 years!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite local places to get fish and chips (as well as their poutine) in the Port Union area

Restaurant is very small, with limited seating - it only has 2 benches. It is mostly for take out. The restaurant is also really old looking, and it has looked the same since I first started coming in here, which was during my elementary school days.

I always find myself to be craving the food here, and most particularly their poutine haha! My boyfriend usually gets the Haddock and Chips, and he loves it! Portions are really good and always make you full, for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"If not for all these 4/5 star Yelp reviews, I would not have visit Malt N Salt Fish & Chips.

Talking about off my territory and radar, I got a little freak out when the voice from my GPS guiding me through some residential streets in Scarborough. Until I got to this little strip plaza....

Malt N Salt is definitely a take out place with 2 really small tables that seat 2. The two Chinese ladies behind the counter looked kind of surprise to see me waltzing in wanting Halibut with Chips ($8.95) eating in.

The fish itself has this really light, crispy and golden batter that I enjoyed. Skip the fries as they are nothing special...

While I was stuffing my face, the lady behind the counter came over to my table and start showing me where all the condiments and which one I should add to my food..... maybe I just look  lost and out of my element?!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way through town. The haddock special for $7.55 was an excellent value. Nice, light crispy batter on the fish. Some fries were a bit soggy, but most were crispy. I love that it's all prepared on site, including the fresh-cut fries. The place only has two tables. We had takeout, so that wasn't an issue for us."}
