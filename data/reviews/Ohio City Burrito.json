{"text":"I have made the trek (20 minutes) to OCB twice in the past week. Both visits yielded exceptional, tasty, and fresh burritos. I will eighty-six Chipotle from my \"fast\" food preferences in favor of Ohio City Burrito. In fact, Chipotle does not sound appetizing to me anymore.   The atmosphere in this local joint is welcoming and the staff is very friendly. I got a burrito with Carnitas, guac, sour cream, rice, beans, an array of salsas, lettuce, and cheese. Unlike Chipotle, you can taste each ingredient in every bite. Continuing that thread, the guac and sour cream are distributed evenly throughout the burrito (both of which are FREE). The ingredients are superior to Chipotle's. The flavors omitted from them are bold vs. bland and predictable.    *I do not mean to compare the two. The reality is- until OCB, Chipotle was the best burrito I had ever tasted.*  I highly recommend OCB to anyone in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito is by far one of my favorite places to eat. The meat is always tender, and the ingredients always taste fresh. I always get a naked burrito (burrito in a bowl,) and I always walk out satisfied. I recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the staff wasn't very friendly.  It was my first time and I'll definitely go back again because of the food- but they should really be more patient with helping someone who has never been there."}
{"text":"So sad. The taco salad was a watery bunch of wilted iceberg lettuce topped with a huge pile of cooked onions, a smattering of black beans straight from a can, small  gobs of guac, sour cream and a tad of cheese.  I literally threw it in the garbage and drove over to Wendy's .  Not good, guys."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food.  I could eat it every day- I've actually tested this theory.  While I am a fan of pretty much every sit down Mexican restaurant, I really enjoy the convenience of places like Chipotle, Quedoba's and OCB.( I feel bad bringing up those other places in a review about OCB, but I feel I need to make a comparison so people know what to expect)  I love Ohio City Burrito because it tastes fresher and more real than the other aforesaid two.  They don't charge extra for guacamole, which scores major points with me.  They make burritos the size and weight of a newborn baby and they are delicious.  Their salsas and hot sauces are great; they have depths of flavor as well as heat.  The service is friendly and fast.  I also really dig the Day of the Dead theme the place has going.  Actually, the skeleton on the sign is what attracted me in the first place.  Absolutely worth a try."}
{"text":"Best damn burrito I've ever had. I don't know why I haven't tried this place sooner. The flavor is so unbelievable. I got a burrito with rice, black & refried beans, shredded chicken, peppers, guacamole, medium salsa and a little cheese for just about $7 and it was huge!! I can definitely see myself becoming a frequent flyer at this establishment. I just wish they were open a little later than 8pm."}
{"text":"Garbage..don't waist your time. go to Chipotle. rice was hard and not cooked right the guy actually took some of the chicken out of my bowl I guess he thought a table spoon of chicken was enough and  he put to much in my bowl.. it's not the same food that tony rizzo got. .don't waist your time.."}
{"text":"My favorite burrito in Cleveland.  I know many will disagree with me on this but it beats the hell out of Chipotle.    My go to is the chicken, which is shredded here.  I also am in love with grandma's salsa.  If you like sweet salsa, try this one out.  Also, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Food good, not great. The costumer service is poor and uninviting.   I am a regular and have had good experiences in the past but last night was very very unpleasant. Upon arrival they had mentioned they were busy and they were out of rice and we could not dine in since they were closing in 30 minutes. To me as a small restaurant owner I would never tell costumers that they can't dine in because they are closing soon. This is so uninviting and makes me think what is the point of your hours. When your open your open and you should go above and beyond your costumers not trying to get your employees out earlier. Sure enough a couple and a family of 6 came in and after hearing the news they all left. Again who knows if these are first time diners at your establishment. Way to set a good first impression.   So my girlfriend and I both ordered west 25th tacos ( 2 each) because they didn't have rice to make burritos.  We also got 2 drinks (one of them was only filled 3/4 of the way) and a bag of chips.   When I was checking out since I am a regular I had my club card to stamp. I had 2 of them that had a few stamps on them each. The cashier tried to explain to me that these were for burritos only. I had responded they always did it for me in the past if I got 2 west 25th st tacos since it equals the cost of a burrito and I said anyways we would of gotten burritos if there was rice. She explained to me very snotty that the rice doesn't make the burrito. Its all the other ingredients. She also said we shouldn't of waited till they were about to close to come in. Isn't that the point of business hours? We were there at 8:30 when they close at 9. ( I know their business hours on the website say close at 8 but since again I'm a regular I know on Friday and Saturdays they close at 9).  Last thing I'll say as a business owner and former hospitality professor, the costumer is everything. Going above and beyond for them will continue success of a business. Telling a family carryout only when they close in a half hour isn't a way to build business. I don't think this one particular cashier reflects the entire staff but she was a bad apple. She needs to learn how to speak to costumers because she was very abrasive. I teach my staff you treat the first costumer the exact same as the last.  Food was good. Still think Chipotle has more flavor but I always try and support local.  I don't think I will be back. You should also consider taking the delivery off of your website because I called to deliver another time and they said I couldn't"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. I had the taco bowl. The food could use more flavor but that can be fixed with some hot sauce. The garlic chili hot sauce fit just right.  Relatively clean place with plwnty of parking across the street."}
{"text":"Needs a lot of work.  To expensive for what you get.  I prefer chipotle to this place which is unfortunate because I want to support local.  They need a brown rice option and a burrito bowl and a drink should not be over 9 dollars!  The flavors were ok.. Not my favorite ohio city eatery"}
{"text":"I love the brothers burrito. It's definitely a great alternative to Chipotle or Qdoba. The staff is always very friendly and the line moves very quickly."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Limited menu items...but I always got a burrito.  The owners and workers are always super nice."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I am not sure why it gets so much hype. Typical giant burrito. The guacamole was very good but the chips were cardboard like. I thought both the pork and chicken were very flavorless. Even my husband who loves the the giant burrito craze was not very impressed. I ate a few bites of my burrito and moved on. The staff was very friendly and the inside is very cute and clean."}
{"text":"For the longest I had seen Ohio City Burrito driving up and down W 25. Finally decided to stop in today. I was pleasantly surprised that the tastes and menu selection were a little more authentic than I thought they would be.   I ordered a chicken Brother's Burrito with black and retried beans which I watched them meticulously piece together. I liked the fact that guacamole was free. I also got tomatoe and corn salsa. Which brings me to my only complaint.  The chicken and salsa was not nearly spicy or seasoned enough. I go to burrito spots expecting the majority or basic ingredients to have some sort of heat.   Other than this I was okay with my spur of the moment cuisine choice. Evrrything tasted pretty good and the ingredients had at least average freshness. Although I won't be in a rush to return anytime soon, at some point I will most likely be back."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian burrito and chips with salsa. Food was good tasting and fresh. Salsa had lots of cilantro making it delicious. The OCB hot sauce was really good."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews- they were about half split with the love vs. hate.  Food was perpared to order right in front of our eyes, I had the vegetarian bean burrito, husband had the chicken.  For the price the burritos were HUGE and very tasty.  Had Chiptole Choula hot sauce, which is always a positive.  Everything was very fresh and had just the right amount of seasoning.  The hot salsa was very good and had a great garlic flavor.  Would definitely go back next time we're in the Cleveland downtown area."}
{"text":"The burrito was okay - I've had better. They were out of steak and didn't offer to make any more. I found the guacamole VERY salty - it was good, but salty.  The service was good though, friendly and inviting. But the food was only sub-par."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like OCB, I really did. I went there with my boyfriend on a Saturday around 5 pm for a snack. Neither of us had been there before but we always saw it while driving by. Small interior, very cheery, all seating was occupied. BF got nachos with pulled pork and a drink, which set him back around $9. Here's the cliff notes:  -Hipster-central. No one over age 30 was to be had. Does not appear to be family or child friendly. -Waitstaff was not friendly or helpful, including the manager running the cash register. Even after explaining that we were newbies, they rushed us through the ordering process and did not explain anything relating to the menu.  -Small portions.  Overall, food was bland. Cheese on nachos was not melted, I could've made better at home. Pork was fatty and bland. Maybe D. made the wrong menu choice, but after that I would not go back."}
{"text":"Why ever go to that Chipotle line again?  This place has some great food and chips - all fresh and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Wayyyy better than chipotle. In love with this place! I'm vegan and have a dairy allergy, the lady working this afternoon was super nice and changed her gloves for me. That's so damn sweet knowing some people aren't the nicest about it. We'll be back!! #nationaltacoday"}
{"text":"Evidently people giving this place more than two stars have no clue what the hell good food is. The meat choices are actually pastes. The Tortillas thinner than Dollar Store toilet paper. (Don't ask me how I know). My son's Burrito just disintegrated after two bites. I can't believe what Cleveburghers think is good food after seeing all the great reviews about this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Came in during the week for lunch, the place was full, the line went fast. I had a naked burrito and the bowl was stuffed to the max. The rice is kinda bland. I like that the guacamole comes with it. I wouldn't make an special trip to W25th to eat here but I would come back."}
{"text":"I went to OCB after trying a few other nearby burrito places to stop having to drive 50 minutes for the best burrito place in Northeast Ohio, Taco Tantos (Kent, OH) after I graduated. Unfortunately, Ohio City Burrito doesn't compare.   Taste-wise OCB isn't so spectacular that I'd rather drive the 20 minutes to grab a burrito there instead of the 5 minute trip to Chipotle. The only reason why I would rank OCB above Chipotle is the free guacamole. In style and taste they are somewhat similar  - with the slight edge to OCB.    It's a cute little place by W. 25th and Bridge. There's ample indoor seating and some outdoor as well. I didn't have too much trouble finding on-street parking just off of 25th. Service is fast and efficient.  Personal cons: The chicken is pulled instead of chopped. The tortilla faces the same problem as Chipotle - it splits, is slightly chewy and needs to be pressed.  Pros: the price is pretty cheap (burritos comparable to Chipotle), the ingredients taste fresh."}
{"text":"I really hyped this place up in my head. I am a Chipotle fan, but I have to admit, chains get old... and Chipotle is no different. I would have to say, this place was great. I got a veggie burrito and it was delicious. I would definitely go back. I liked that they had a refried beans option instead of pinto beans. It was quick and the service was friendly. I was not the biggest fan of the veggies they put in (a little too sour for my liking) and the tortilla itself felt a bit on the flimsy side... (compared to Chipotle), but other than that, I was pleased. They have Jarritos! I want to go go back and try the horchata. I also got the nachos and they were filling and substantial. I love a good nacho... and the chips didn't get soggy underneath all the toppings. They even heated them up so the cheese got all melty and delicious. I might go back just for the nachos... :)"}
{"text":"oh yawn, boring menu.. so few choices and not very creative..  maybe i had high expectations for a place so close to the westside market.  you know they sell all kinds of fresh herbs and veggies there right?  bagged lettuce and cheese and identical food that can be found a chipotle is what i found.  perhaps later they can find ways to stand out.  i'm still waiting for places to bake off burritos so they don't turn into mush halfway through eating them. not so excited here..."}
{"text":"The guacamole is not up charged here so for me- you get extra points for that alone. I see folks like to compare this place to Chipotle - ok I could see that, they make similar items. I like both places, this one is less crowded than Chipotle so you can get your food and go, or not quickly. You can sit outside if the weather permits. I'm not a fan of the chips nor salsa, the freshness is lacking here but I support local business when I can.  I suggest adding a daily special or a new flavor every so often. Oh and stay open later but I guess the location makes that difficult."}
{"text":"Ugh. I want to love this place, I love that it's local and it has so much potential but it is so disappointing every time. The horchata I took one sip and threw away. Tastes like watered down corn syrup. The hard tacos were all soggy and falling apart. The meat was unbelievably salty. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Big fan of OCB.  I only get the vegetarian burrito, so can't speak to the quality of the beef/chicken/pork.  Wish they used better cheese (if they used better, 5 stars).  Oh, you can also fax in orders and they deliver.  Portions are huge, so go hungry."}
{"text":"Main points about this restaurant: 1) Standard tex mex burrito (of the Qdoba/Chipotle ilk) 2) Free guacamole   The servers here are very friendly.  Their chicken is pulled and mixed with salsa, which is different then the standard chicken you'd get at Chipotle.  Based on the price point and taste, I choose this place over Qdoba or Chipotle pretty much every time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  cute decor, and good reasonably priced burritos with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Best burritos in the Midwest.  Plus the wrap the burritos do as to prevent spillage.  The service is quick,  polite, and coordinated. I wish the guacamole was more chunky but the selection of salsas makes up for it."}
{"text":"We've gone a few times - always clean, friendly, yummy. The food is well seasoned & flavorful. My teen son *swears* a trip into Cleveland is worth it just to eat here. He'd say its a 5-star experience. We've never left disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be better. I was born and raised in Texas so I am a bit picky about my Mexican. To me the taste of my burrito was a bit bland."}
{"text":"This place has no clue what mexican food is. They don't even have Carne Asada !! They use white rice in the burritos. Who does that?? The rice was under cooked and crunchy. Coming from So. Cal. I know what good mexican food is. Trust  me this is NOT quality mexican food."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Such a awesome gem in the ohio city area. I used to work at chipotle and I feel this is much better. I love that they give the option of refried beans and free guac!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of some tacos, nachos, and chips and salsa-- was told within the hour.  50 minutes later we got a call saying no delivery because problems with delivery bike.  They were very apologetic and offered us 15% off to come pick it up.  Parking is a mess there on Sat afternoons, but we went up to get the order.  They threw in a couple free sodas too when we went in, so we thought all was good.  Got home and none of the tacos had lettuce and cheese as stated in menu.  Also, no chips in the bag.  Tried calling for 10 minutes but their line was busy so we just gave up and ate.  Tacos were pretty good, but the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths.  Not to sound too snarky, but if your menu is only a handle of items, you should get them correct."}
{"text":"This place is really good I go 3 or 4 times out the month before work. The meat shredded and very good and u can make it the way you want its different and b better then Chipotle to me I think. My opinion I would go here before I go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Literally the best burrito shop in Cleveland. Btw everything is freshly made in house doesn't get better than that"}
{"text":"It simply annoys me when someone says they like Chipotle over Ohio City Burrito. This is one my favorite spots in Cleveland, outstanding food, convenient location and great owners.  Make sure to get the Grandma's sauce. Only complaint I have, wish they were open past 8PM, so get there early.  Please visit and support local restaurants over chains."}
{"text":"Stopped by OCB for lunch, and got a \"Brother's Burrito\". I would say the comparisons to Chipolte are valid; it's a familiar format-- pick your protein, carbohydrate, salsa, extras, watch them wrap it up and deliver you a foil-wrapped package of delicious. The guacamole at OCB is undeniably fresher than that at Chipolte, and the pico de gallo had a better flavor than Chipolte's as well. I would go back."}
{"text":"Sub par burritos. I got the pork it had zero flavor.  If i wanted sub par burritos I'd go to chipotle.  Just left, not hungry anymore but i feel I should go eat sonething else. So i can eat sonething that tastes good.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best burritos ever!!! Way better than chipotle. Awesome customer service and great atmosphere. Fresh ingredients and big servings. My favorite burrito place."}
{"text":"So I went here last night and couldn't write a review because I was in a burrito coma! After reading reviews I didn't know what to expect before i went because some reviews can be a hit or miss based on preference and after all the comparisons to Chipotle my interest was  definitely peeked. It was definitely a nice change to Chipotle but better than Chipotle I disagree with. Let's just Say they are in their own lane and creating their own food style.  I ordered the Brother's Burrito w/ chicken which was really good and I ordered the chips and hot salsa. The chips had great flavor and I couldn't stop eating them on the ride home, but the salsa however tasted like stewed tomatoes out of a can with alot of spice. I couldn't even eat it, because it tasted so bad. Definitely wasn't fresh salsa  with freshly chopped tomatoes which was a huge disappointment. Overall I enjoyed the rest of my meal and will go back again for another huge Burrito. The price is reasonable and I love to support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Went back here yesterday, and the guy must have taken one look at me and gone, \"she eats a lot\" because that burrito was amazingly HUGE!  So I take back what I said about the wimpy-sized burrito in the last review.  It all depends on who's stuffing.  The proof lies in the leftover half of a burrito in my fridge."}
{"text":"I wanted to like OCB so bad! First time having it, and probably the last time going.   PROS- Food seemed authentic             Bang for your buck  CONS- Everything about the place seemed dirty, tables, prep kitchen, service etc             Thought the food lacked flavor and spice   With so many great spots in OC, it'll be easy to pass this spot up."}
{"text":"Meh. Everyone I know raves about this place but every time I try it I am disappointed. The biggest thing for me is the cheese selection. I have to admit that I love cheese and work on my \"night cheese\" almost daily but the stuff they serve here reminds me of what you would find in a discount generic grocery store in a 12 pound bag. No bueno :("}
{"text":"Stopped at OCB today around lunch time and the place was packed.  I was struck by just how small this place is; it's a pretty narrow and tight space throughout.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Even though I think they were in the early stages of the lunch rush, they were greeting everyone with a hello and a smile, especially the girl working the register.  We got the Taco Salad with Carnitas and the Nachos.  The dishes were fresh and the meat flavorful.  My only complaint is I felt like they were stingy with the amount of toppings they give you, for the price I wanted more.  I left full though and will be back again.  Definitely better than those other 'fast casual' places that shall remain nameless- support your local businesses instead!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and had a fantastic pulled-pork burrito.  I'll definitely be revisiting this place in the future.  Try the horchata."}
{"text":"Burritos are a favorite of mine, but... I don't care for Chipotle.  Luchita's Express near CWRU/Little Italy closed prematurely, so...  I'm lost. What do I do for a good burrito? How do I satiate those cravings? Where do I go for a burrito without succumbing to the monster Chipotle out of convenience?!  Well, I've found my answer. OCB is fantastic.   Though it is a bit of a drive for me, I keep in mind that if I don't want to drive for a tasty burrito, I'd have to settle for my least favorite. That normally staves off the hunger and I will wait until it's convenient to come to OCB. The decor is really comforting in a strangely fiery Dia De Los Muertos way and there are clippings detailing their success all over the wall by the door. If that isn't enough to tell you you're in for a treat, I don't know what is.   On to the food. I've never been able to eat and enjoy that much burrito in my life and it was definitely worth it. The choices are delicious and though the burritos are a bit smaller than you-know-who's, you feel like you've gotten better quality, which really matters to me. I'd rather have a slightly smaller meal full of delicious and good than a sloppy greasy mess that's bigger than my head.   Really, there's no reason not to come here: Local, delicious and a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can always tell when a restaurant isn't doing well. They start seriously skimping on ingredients. I just got a veggie burrito from OCB tonight, and it was 95% cheap white rice. I saw maybe 5 chunks of tomato and a dozen or so beans. I live in the neighborhood and am really tired of restaurants trying to be too specialized. We have a chili-only place that's awful. Krazy Macs, a mac and cheese-only place, is gone, replaced by Rose Angel, a taco-only spot, that also went under quickly. Now they're a \"tapas\" place, which means \"we can't be bothered with hiring a kitchen staff, eat dinner elsewhere.\" It will be closed in a few months. To me, tapas means lazy, unless you're a big name like Lolita. The only place that got the one-item-onloy-menu right in Ohio City is Happy Dog. They're all hot dogs, but everyone loves hot dogs as a daily meal. They have veggie and regular dogs, and the toppings are plentiful and awesome. Prices are good, and the beer selection is fantastic. Good bye Ohio City Burrito. Future potential Ohio City locations, learn a lesson from neighborhood mainstays like Johnny Mango and Heck's. Don't skimp, and don't serve only one thing, unless you're a pizza or hot dog place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick lunch. I would say it's well above Chipolte, but just below a nice, sit-down Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant itself has a fun atmosphere to it, the employees were really nice and easy to engage with. The decor is hip and kinda artsy. There's a bulletine board to post your crappy band's flier at or an event posting about the annual lunar meeting of kindred spirit chakra swap.  I ordered the taco salad and was pleased with what I got for the price I paid. There's options for beans and salsa, so you can get it hotter, more tame, black beans or refried. Make it your own! If it isn't hot enough, you can grab the bottle of hot sauce that is conviently located by the napkins and utensils."}
{"text":"I usually get a chicken burrito bowl.  Ingredients are always fresh and flavorful and great portion. Price is very good compared to other burrito places like Chiptole.  OCB doesn't charge extra for Guac.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. It's a local chipotle. Liked the bowl. Could be more flavorful.   The ingredients were more varied than at chipotle. That was good."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito is a great lunch stop. As others are saying, definitely comparable to Chipotle. The food is really good, not mind blowing incredible, but I mean...it's a burrito. And it's cheap and portioned largely. I've been here twice and both times the ingredients were fresh and tasty. It's a local joint that serves good, fresh, affordable food, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Ok so call me crazy but I like Chipotle better. Yes... seriously. I had shredded beef instead of chunks of steak it was kind of dry and bland. It needed more seasoning. The rice was not seasoned like it is at Chipotle. And the salsa was bland. At Chipotle there is just more flavor to everything. At OCB I needed hot sauce to give it any kind of flavor. Been twice, gave it the good college try, but's it's not for me. The lady behind the counter assembling was very nice and explained everything. I always try to support local places but its just not as good. Sorry guys. I wanted to love you, I tried to love you, but it's you... it's not me."}
{"text":"OCB was a nice stop on a recent tour of the Ohio City/West Side Market bar district. Although they'd hate the comparison, the selections and ordering system are similar to Chipotle in terms of build-your-own burritos and bowls (\"naked burritos,\"in OCB-speak).  Although the selection of ingredients is a little smaller than some of the chains, quality trumps quantity here, particularly in the salsa dept. Among the several selections, the habanero hot offering was fresh and truly fiery, appreciably better than anything I've had at a chain--worth a visit just for that. OCB is uber cheap, and (unlike giant corporate chain whose name we shall not repeat) allows you to add guac for free.   Actually, if we're ranking OCB alongside refgional/national chains, here's what I'd say: slightly better than Chipotle; appreciably better than Qdoba or Baja Fresh; vastly better than Moe's or Freebirds. In fact, why are you eating at any of those places rather than supporting a scrappy local underdog? And why were you eating at Moe's or Freebirds at all?  The dining room is decorated in Dia de los muertos kitsch and available-for-purchase business swag. It looks cool and fun, and represents a well-thought approach to the market niche. The staff was nice and informative. I like Ohio City Burrito and you should stop in to buffer yourself against the slew of craft brews you'll want afterword in the Ohio City brewpubs."}
{"text":"Came here once and really enjoyed our experience. Had always heard good things about the place, and figured we needed to try it out ourselves.  Pretty small place with a few table to sit at, but we got our food to go. Food is ordered and served basically like at any new burrito place like Chipotle or Moe's. Both of us went for the brother's burrito, as this seemed to be the standard option with all the fixings. I had the carnitas (pulled pork) at the recommendation of the employee making our burritos, and was not disappointed. The big positives for me here were local business, good food, and reasonable price. My burrito was $7.15 plus tax, which was sufficient for my appetite. The food is similar to most place of this style, but I felt it was of high quality, plus I'll always choose the local place over the chain. The one negative here is that they close at 10 PM, so you can't get a quick burrito after a night out on W 25th."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to that chain burrito spot since discovering OCB. I would eat here every day if I could. I guess I could, but my husband probably would start to complain.   I've had just about every combo of burrito I can think of with no complaints. The pinto beans are super delicious. The guac on burritos is included. Hooray! The carnitas exquisite.   For anyone who complains about a lack of flavor - you're doing it wrong. Load up on the salsa (they have so many!) and throw on some jalapeños.   I also love the vibe of this place, my frequent burrito purchaser punch card, and the fact that they deliver to my house when I'm being super lazy."}
{"text":"I'd say OCB is a step down from Chipotle and I am not a fan of Chipotle.  I will take an authentic Mexican burrito join any day.  I actually thought the taste was a bit bland and lacked character.  I could re-create that exact same burrito taste in my kitchen.  Small menu but if it's a burrito you're seeking, you'll find it.  I love the baby burrito--a 6\" flour tortilla with beans, cheese and salsa for $1.85.  It's probably the best value on the menu.  Their blue and red corn tortilla chips are good, and I am a fan of the Red salsa which is a hot salsa."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito is the kind of place that I always try to stop at when I'm in the neighborhood. I personally think that it is WAY better than Chipotle. I usually get the barbacoa which is deliciously flavored and more tender and flavorful than the Chipotle counterpart. I also love that they offer refried beans for burritos here because I love them! The ingredients here are just fresher tasting than any chain could reasonably achieve. The staff is also very nice and the prices are reasonable which is a huge plus!   The only reason I am giving this 4/5 stars is, like others have mentioned, there is no margaritas or alcoholic beverages offered. I think that it would definitely make the experience more fun to have a nice marg with my burrito! But the burritos themselves are delicious AND they offer horchata!!"}
{"text":"Everybody loves burritos and if you're on Cleveland's near west side there's no better place to pick one up than Ohio City Burrito on W.25th. To compare OCB to national chain Chipotle is natural; in most aspects OCB reigns supreme.  The main thing you want to know about a burrito is how does it taste. OCB's burritos are very good. The guac, which is tasty though not as chunky as I prefer, is slathered on the tortilla before the toppings are added. This allows for an even distribution of guac throughout the wrapped burrito. Two thumbs up for that!  The rice is where OCB falters a little. They only give you the option of white rice. It's plain with no seasoning or cilantro and it is very salty. The saltiness is particularly pronounced if you order a burrito bowl; I find myself drinking a ton of water during/after eating a bowl from OCB.  The meat options at OCB are winners. The barbacoa and carnitas are my favorite options; each is more flavorful and moist than their Chipotle counterparts. The spiced, shredded chicken here is also very good but I have a slight preference for the diced chicken Chipotle offers.  OCB has five salsa options: three mild - pico de gallo, corn salsa, and \"Grandma's Special\" salsa; one medium red; and one hot. I usually get all five, as all are delicious. Word to the wise: there is a lot of garlic in \"Grandma's\" salsa.  Your burrito can be finished off with the typical lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. I can't comment on the dairy options because I'm allergic. The shredded lettuce is about as plain as you can get but at least it's fresh and crisp.  The one area that Chipotle beats OCB is using purportedly hormone free animals to supply their meat. Useful to note if that matters to you (and I know it does for some). If OCB sources their meat from animals that are antibiotic- and artificial hormone-free, they don't advertise that fact.  With an inexpensive price tag for any of the burrito options ($6.45), a friendly staff and efficient service I'll gladly shop local and go to OCB for my burritos any day of the week, except Sunday-- only because OCB is closed on Sundays :)"}
{"text":"Very good service and great food the beef and chicken are my favorite very juicy and tasty"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is about this place....it's a total rip off of chipotle.  You go up to the counter choose between burrito, burrito bowl, tacos or salad and then choose all your toppings.  Yes it's true you don't have to pay extra for guacamole, but they put so little on I couldn't even taste it :( Also, the burrito I ordered was ok but nothing special.  I was also disappointed that they don't serve alcohol.  A few margaritas would have made this place way better!"}
{"text":"This little Ohio City establishment in a gem!! The quality of the food is amazing and everything tastes authentic and delicious!!  I normally get the Brother's Burrito (classic with guac, sour cream, chicken, rice and pico and corn salsa) and you can't lose ordering that.    But today I tried the 25th St. Tacos :D They are soft taco shells with refried beans spread on them wrapped around a crunchy shell and then filled with choice of meat and salsas, what have you.  These were amazing!! I got one with chicken, which I knew going in the chicken was good, but i got another one with the carnitas, and I think I liked the carnita taco better! I thnk the chicken is spiced up more than the pork carnitas, so I liked having the less spiced meat on the tacos.  They were kinda messy but worth it.  I got sour cream on the side so I could add it to each bite.  This place is totally worth the trip!! Especially if you are down by the market picking up produce or what have you and you want to stop for lunch somewhere beside a place in the market, this would be a great choice!"}
{"text":"We passed by this the night before on a stroll up and down 25th street so the next day came back in to try it.  It was really good!  Everyone was friendly, the food was all delicious (the pork was amazing) and it was pretty cheap!  If I lived in Cleveland, I think I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I *heart* OCB!  I've tolerated Chipotle but I'd only go there if the company I was with wanted to.  I always felt it was too spicy for my taste.  OCB has more options when it comes to spice so I find it to be just right for me.  I always get the \"naked burrito\" (in a bowl) with shredded chicken, refried beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, grandma's salsa, and sour cream.  Perfecto!  There is never a long line to have to wait in and they're much faster than Chipotle as well!"}
{"text":"Good, stick to your ribs food, that's one thing I'll always enjoy; Ohio City knows how to make just that!  I've been a fan of the \"giant burrito\" concept since a little place in Cleveland Heights got me hooked. Well, that place is gone, and replaced by several chains who create such things, but I always like...THE HOMETOWN TOUCH!   Ohio City Burrito, it has THAT touch; home made ingredients, made fast, fresh and tasty:) Their \"Day of the Dead\" ambiance also makes you feel that this place has loads of personality. On top of that, their prices are solid, inexpensive, and if you're looking for something decent that'll get you through the rest of the day, stop in for one of their amazing burritos that are hands AND feet above the rest!   Now, parking is only street, so make sure you find a good spot, but other than that, all I've gotta say is if you want a burrito that you won't pity, stop on in to Ohio City:)"}
{"text":"Stay away.  First off, the wait time on the delivery system was the biggest problem. We were told our order would take 45min to 1 hour. 2 hours later, there was still no food. Since our address was literally down the street we thought it would be convenient to have it delivered thinking it would be quick. But since that wasn't the case, we went there in person out of frustration. We arrive only to find that the delivery person just left and the girl working the counter was \"educating\" us on how to place orders.  She told us that if it was a priority order it should have been made 24 hours in advance and we should have gave them know more information on the importance of our order. Also the people were saying they employed a third party delivery service to shirk the blame and put it to someone else. This was never informed of us when we first ordered to begin with, and also it was really annoying after the fact that the order was placed.   Secondly, the food that was made was incorrect. Several of the orders that we're placed were made incorrectly. This establishment obviously failed to follow directions. They may want to either invest in hearing aids or glasses for taking down information more efficiently. Granted, I will say it was a large order of 15 burrito meals, but when more than half are made improperly, there is a problem.  There were peppers in some burritos when there wasn't supposed to be. Some had toppings that shouldn't have been on them. Names and information was mixed up and it just turned out to be a huge debacle that left a bad taste in everyone's mouth."}
{"text":"Popped in for a bite one night with a couple of buddies. They were out of everything except pork (No big deal) The guys working were friendly and the free guac was unexpected.  This place is good, not quite Chipotle but not a horrible experience. I plan on going back when I'm in OC as long as the Touch Food truck isn't around. Can say no to that thing. Yum."}
{"text":"I like this place. I fought myself over this one, but overall good experience.  I was the only person eating there other than a couple that seemed to be in distress. You're eating overstuffed burritos and valentine's day is coming up. Get with the program and stop being selfish.    I had a barbacoa burrito. I like the even distribution of burrito content. This is not a Boolean equation however, many places fail miserably to achieve. Not Ohio City burrito. The burrito is rolled well with the foil. nicely contoured to burrito dimensions, I want to learn more about how they practice and compete amongst staff. This seems like quality control disguised as fun. I was tempted to try one of those exotic flavored sodas I have been hearing so much about. Next time."}
{"text":"Okay people, this is where you come to bring people to the good-side. AKA away from chipotle. So obviously this place tastes amazing but let me just name a few other perks- it uses local food from the market, it is a local company, it offers guac for free on it (not an extra charge like chipotle), inexpensive, very cute decor, outdoor seating, prime location in ohio city....need I say more? I take every sworn-in chipotle lover here to show them that fresh food tastes, well, FRSEH!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of a local version of a certain big burrito chain, but with better carnitas with more flavor. And the hot salsa actually has some heat.  Cute interior and exterior, the main killer is that while they're not a bad burrito, they're not particularly authentic or particularly stand-out enough to blow me away. The experience seems to be more like that big chain burrito place than anything else.  Which leaves them kind of in the middle of a no-man's land, a solid improvement over the brand name alternatives, but that's such a low bar to start with that I have a hard time awarding that 4th star."}
{"text":"I walked into this place excited to try their chips and salsas as I believe those two items are the foundation of any establishment that serves taco, burritos, and other such south of the border fare. To my dismay, OCB does not prepare their own chips, but orders them off a truck instead.  It should be noted that a few blocks away,  at the muy famosa West Side Market, one can find some of the best chips in Cleveland @ a stand known as Orale.  Upon learning that fact, I could not logically contrive a way to convince myself to try their burritos.   I will be back once I can get my head around these boxed chips......"}
{"text":"Cute little place within walking distance of the West Side Market. I got a huge burrito with tons of meat - I think I got the carnitas, but not sure. I could have easily split the burrito with my husband, who ordered two tacos instead. The soda fountain was being repaired while we were there, so we ordered Jarritos bottled sodas instead. Pretty tasty food and the service was casual but friendly enough. I would probably try another of the many food options in the area before I'd go back here, but it totally did not suck."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to grab dinner.  This place is pretty meh.  I was hoping for something more flavorful than Chipotle or Qdoba.  What I got was a pretty bland Chicken burrito.  The cheese was pretty boring out of a bag generic cheese, rice was ok, beans needed more flavor, the salsa needed more ingredients. I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Nice burritos.  Rip chipotle's business model, add cool mexican dia de los muertes skeletons, step up and give a guy some fresh jalapenos by request, you got yourself a good burrito spot."}
{"text":"First visit and if I lived here, I'd be a regular.  Friendly staff, great food and atmosphere. Everything was seasoned perfectly and made to order."}
{"text":"This place is great!  My bf and I got the brother's burrito with chicken and the other with carnitas. Both are pulled and saucy. We both got black beans (also very well seasoned) and fajita veggies (onions and peppers) are extra (why? All other chains serve it complimentary).  I love the corn salsa as well as the habanero salsa (which is actually spicy!)  My only gripe is that I wish the tortilla was a bit more chewy and a bit thicker. The burritos were sooooo loaded that the tortilla gets weepy quickly."}
{"text":"Chipotle who? In all honesty, I was expecting OCB to be very similar to the chain, and in some ways it is. The food options are the same-rice, beans, meats, salsas, etc. You can get a burrito, bowl, or salad, just like chipotle.  But the biggest differences I noticed were the flavor and portions, and that's why I'll put OCB ahead of chipotle any day. I got a carnitas taco salad and they loaded on everything. SO much pork and black beans. And guac is included!!! This was the best part for me. I took a nibble of the bf's barbacoa burrito, and that was also exceptional.  Everything tasted more authentic and home cooked, which I really like. I'm a sucker for a family owned restaurant. The decorations and the music are also a really authentic touch.  This was my first time here, but it definitely won't be my last. Another great thing about Ohio City!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burritos and the ingredients seem fresh. Not amazing but definitely worth it's price so you really can't go wrong. Plus I hear it's locally owned and even though I travel a bit I still like to keep money in the communities rather than making chipotle and qudoba richer."}
{"text":"Used to like this place when I lived in Cleveland. In town from San Francisco and completely bummed at the sloppy burrito to go"}
{"text":"What a great burrito!  Love that fried beans are an options.  Pork was tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... I definitely prefer supporting local business over chains, but after eating there a few times, my first impression of this place stands... disappointing. Definitely not in the same league as Chipotle. (And, frankly, if other users are right about the Sysco trucks, the food you eat at Chipotle is probably more local.) The meat is dry from sitting in steam tables all day and it's not seasoned enough. Free guac is nice for those who like it, which I don't. Portion size seems the same as any other place like this, but that's not a big deal to me. I'll take flavor and freshness over portion size any day."}
{"text":"Every single time my boyfriend and I come here, the staff is extremely friendly, funny and they laugh at my jokes (and I'm not funny). I would pick this place over Chipotle every time. I don't even like burritos that much but these burritos are so good. At Chipotle I always get a piece of meat that is hard to chew, but never here. The guacamole is so f'ing good too. Fast service - friendly staff - an overall cool place to go if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal.   The only complaint I have is that I wish they were open every day of the week!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had a great burrito. The service was very fast and they give you guacamole in every burrito as every burrito place should! Completely stuffed and not too expensive. Their salsas were very good. The bf got the habanero salsa on his burrito and regretted that choice."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and atmosphere of OCB. Burritos are good. They give you guacamole and and refried beans are so good! The only small thing I would say is that the rice sometimes is a bit crunchy/hard..maybe from staying out too long? But besides that, OCB is delicious!! ALSO, get the sprite in the bottle! makes the drink 10 times better. And bring a sharpie with you! Their bathroom is filled with writing and drawings which is pretty awesome :D"}
{"text":"I couldn't get enough burrito visits during my 10 days in Cleveland.  My only complaint is that they don't deliver to Philly. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is casual and fun. This may be my favorite burrito spot."}
{"text":"I had two Thalia tacos and the they were very good.  The atmosphere was a cute little bistro. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple weeks ago - basically this is an independent version of Chipotle.  I had carnitas tacos and they tasted just like Chipotle's.  I would eat here again if I were in the area and had a taste for Chipotle style mexican food because I'd prefer to support independent businesses vs large chains, but I wouldn't make a special trip"}
{"text":"I love Mexican. I love local. I love OHio City Burrito.  Friendly. Fast. Perfect Portions. I agree. Blows the chains out of the water!  Veggie Burrito Veggie Bowl Chips n Guac  Loves me some OCB! (and the skeleton out front)"}
{"text":"Need a scale to properly weigh in on these portions. They are big and this place is a great value. I usually order the naked burrito (no tortilla) when here.  The meats are tender and well seasoned.. The veggies are crisp. The salsas are aptly spiced. This place is a must go for those of you who enjoy a good burrito.  On visit number ten, I finally found a small problem.... Def Leppard and Scorpion aren't my first choice for dining music, but I am confident the 80's channel won't be on again for some time.  Other than that OCB gets a 9.99 out of ten!"}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place. Didn't see a grill, and now after seeing some reviews I realize maybe they are not preparing the meat there. Salsas looked good, but lacked any real flavor. Guacamole seemed to be made in a food processor and again, not much taste. Really, overall the entire burrito was bland. I kept wanting to dip it in something while I was eating.  They really could do much more with this place if they try. I feel bad for poor review, but it is truthful from my visit."}
{"text":"I give it 3 starts because it's local and there isn't a Chipotle near by. Otherwise it would have 2.  I used to love this place, about 2 years ago the food was flavorful and fresh, you got what you ordered, and it was by far my choice over Chipotle any day. I love that they have refried beans, and their salsas are delicious.   I hadn't been there in a while and stopped in to grab a quick dinner. The girl behind the counter was less than helpful and when I ordered I asked for sour cream to go, she didn't give me any and by the time I realized it I was out of the store didn't care to go back.   When she wrapped by burrito she broke the tortilla, and not just a little, it was almost up the entire side of the burrito. I was in a hurry and didn't feel like asking her to re-wrap it, since it was clear that she had no intention of doing so. Personally I don't feel like I should have had to ask because even at chipotle if they rip the tortilla in half while wrapping it they re-wrap the damn thing.   On top of it all the girl looked absolutely bored and you'd think I was bothering her being there to order.   When I got to try my burrito there was NO flavor, the chicken was almost mush and everything was just sort of blah. Maybe it was just that day, but I was wholly underwhelmed, especially since I used to love this place.   I'd give it another try maybe."}
{"text":"Tried the veggie burrito. Everyone I have talked to said that this place was GREAT and better than Chipotle. I will say its pretty good- more tex-mex style than gourmet. Don't get the refried beans they are like glue. Overall I would go again because its close to work, but in no way is it better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Supporting local small business.  lol be to see hard working people living their dreams. Great food great service, great location.  Great alternative to chipotle"}
{"text":"Very good place to go! Very similar to Chipotle, however knowing that this is a locally owed business, it makes it 10 times better. The staff was friendly and the food portions are plentiful. The atmosphere is colorful and inviting, though small.  The food had great flavor and the guacamole was the bomb!   Great place and highly recommend it if you are visiting the West Side Market or having a beer at Great Lakes!"}
{"text":"This is why I love local joints. Jeff and Michelle and their crew began making themselves double-shelled tacos with a soft flour, pasted with refried beans, wrapped around a hard taco, then filled with normal taco things. They loved them so much that they said, \"Hey...why not put this on the menu?\"  And that's how the 25th Street Taco was born. It's my favorite food item in the world."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito... Hmmm. I think some of the reviews are a tad bit harsh. It is very similar to that franchise place that sells humongous burritos that shall remain nameless *cough* chipotle. I do think the ingredients are fresh and comparable. Price is comparable as well. I do like that you can get refried beans here. Also they don't charge you extra for guacamole like they do at that other place... granted they aren't quite as generous with it either. Overall a solid burrito. My beef is with the chips.  For a restaurant that markets itself as authentic their chips are store bought and packaged into snack sized packs. They really need to step up their chip game!!"}
{"text":"Since I'm new to Ohio and I miss Mexican style cooking from Detroit which Ivey eaten my whole life. I appreciate places like Ohio City Burrito. They have pretty good food and they deliver. I love their salsa and  guacamole. I usually always order the chicken taco salad which is a nice size portion packed with flavor. Today I got tacos...yum is the best way I can summarize them. I had chicken tacos with sour cream,guacamole,refried beans,pico and extra cheese. They were excellent. This is my third or fourth time having Ohio City Burrito,I will definitely be returning. I steer away from delivery because they take forever,in their defense I think they bike to locations."}
{"text":"Should be called \"Just Another Burrito Co.\"  Nothing special here at all, although they at least have decent hot sauce.  Some of the worst horchata I've ever had.  I'll be back because I live 30 second away, but I doubt I'll be that excited."}
{"text":"Possibly the best rolled burrito I've ever had  great meat options  affordable  very fresh  Will be going again  above average guac"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I have been to many Mexican restaurants in both Cleveland and NYC but this is my new favorite. They offer generous helpings of guacamole and sour cream on your burrito and you can taste the difference. I also love the decor-a very nice touch. I'm so glad my friend recommended this to me!"}
{"text":"I only say 3 stars because I really wanted to like OCB and would be willing to try it again, but I would hope to receive better food the second time (it should probably get a two stars). I got two Talia's Tacos (basically two small burritos). Everything on the tacos as far as vegetables and the tortilla was fine, but the meat was so blah. I got one with beef and one with pork, and both were meh at best (honestly, my friend asked me which one has the pork and which the beef, and I couldn't answer). I honestly think they are some good meats away from being a 5 star, but I would prefer to go to Tremont and hit up Barrio. However, like I said, I'll give it another shot because the service was friendly, quick, and the food was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? How can one even begin to write a review to properly articulate how incredible, flavorful, and goddamn sexy Ohio City Burrito is?   I've been here a few times and I have yet to be let down.   Service is fast and friendly. Your order is made in front of you like at a Chipotle. There are various vegetarian () and omnivore options. Get the steak. Just get it. It's spicy, tender, flavorful, and delicious. There are a ton of salsa options and multiple tasty add ons.   Chips and salsa are always great, and the guac packs a punch.   Highly recommend if you're in Ohio City and want to devour something simply perfect."}
{"text":"Yum! Had a barbacoa burrito that was spicy! Loved the guacamole! Cute hipster vibe. Prompt courteous service. Unsure why it took me so long to try this place but now I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I really want to like OCB. I like Jeff and Michelle, they're very sweet people, they've got a great spot, the patio with the flowers looks amazing and the new sign really adds character to the joint.   But the food is boring. Someone posted earlier that the ingredients are fresh, they most definitely are not. OCB has no hood system, which means they can't actually cook anything in house. All of their food comes from a Sysco truck (I used to live above this place, I know what I'm talking about) and goes straight into a steam table. It frustrates me tremendously that they don't season the meat just a little bit, nothing is stopping them from adding spice to their food. I feel like the Flying Fig, the new ABC and the Old Angle set the bar for food in Ohio City years ago, and new places opening up in our now \"trendy\" neighborhood are successful just based on the virtue of the fact that they are new. Don't half-ass things people!  REVISED 4/'13 I'm adding another star, I'm not really sure why. It's the exact same menu it was when they first opened... um, might want to switch it up a bit guys. My burrito was good, not delicious but good. I think this is about as high as I'm ever going to be able to rate it until they start cooking their own food and not serving Sysco straight off the truck."}
{"text":"Love me a good Ohio City burrito, or bowl. The food is always fresh and well prepared. My only complaint is that they have some wonky hours. Closed on Sundays and close early during the weekdays. I can only imagine how much more profit they'd gain if they were available a little later. But, to each their own and the deliciousness of the food they offer will never stop me from wanting it more than I should."}
{"text":"Ohio city Burrito's namesake comes from the name of the neighborhood. The menu is fresh and flavorful. Nachos, burritos and salads from the menu or you can create your own. The interior is naturally lit and festive with painted tables and south western accessories. The music ranges from current pop to indie. Plan spending 7-10 bucks. Food is good. Note:  Chips come with your meal but salsa does not. So dont order the meal, order a la carte if want salsa. Chips and salsa is 2.25. Don't forget to ask for a punch card."}
{"text":"I actually just stopped at the new downtown location. I was walking past and figured I would try it. Wow so much better than chipotle could ever hope to be. The chicken is fresh and tasty. Everything was really good and the employees very helpful. This is now going to be one of my frequent stops!"}
{"text":"I did a semester of nursing clinicals right down the street at Lutheran Hospital, and I stopped in here several times for dinner -- it beats the crap out of hospital food, let's just say that. Ingredients were fresh, delicious, and not nearly as salty as ones you would find at Chipotle. Plus, guacamole is included (and the prices are already relatively low). The people working at OCB are a little iffy and not overly friendly, but come on, you're there for a burrito, not to have a heart to heart with the kid ringing up your order. 10/10 will be back again."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SPOT! I am puerto rican and when i walk into this restaurant the loud salsa and merengue music and ambiance is just great. It's a small restaurant with about 6-7 tables and some outdoor seating as well, but it is truly phenomenal. The meat is seasoned to perfection! I always get a Brother's Burrito with Beef... Party in my mouth. Also, the prices are OUTSTANDING! The fact that you get everything you want (guac included) for one set price of 6.45 or so is just great. When I tried this place all i could say was... Chipotle who??. I paid 23$ for two burritos (great sizes) a side of guac and chips and two coca cola bottles! Awesome price, awesome atmosphere and right in the heart of ohio city! It's great!!"}
{"text":"Definitely would not recommend this place based on one simple reason, we arrived 20 minutes before closing snd after ordering and paying they would not allow us to eat the quick meal in the dining area. He actually stated that he bagged it and wanted us to take it to go so they could clean.  He only said this after we ordered and paid! He was rude, not customer friendly and really seemed to have cared less! I will definitely register a complaint with the owner. I will elaborate more when I get on my laptop."}
{"text":"Must have food-binge-nap ASAP.   I just consumed almost an entire chicken burrito from OCB. Yep, you heard me right. I can so close to demolishing that thing. And I'm basking food-coma happiness right now.  I'm bumping my rating for Ohio City Burrito up another star, and here's why:  - I love the local vibe of this place and the \"whatever/however\" you want it attitude.  - It's way better than Chipotle, and not just because it's local. Besides, being a locally-owned business doesn't give you a pass to suck, so don't even go there with me.   The chicken is *not* burnt like Chipotle, hallelujah! Maybe I'm the only person out there who doesn't think that burnt chicken = flavored/spiced chicken, but hey... that's just me. Bland flavors? Seriously? I don't understand people. There was a ton of glorious flavors in my burrito and it's not like I have a sensitivity to spice. In fact, all the ingredients I put in my 'rito complimented each other perfectly, without one overwhelming the other. And that super hot, habanero salsa? Divine heat. Nom.   Maybe it's because I never really got into the Chipotle thing like everyone else did, but in my mind OCB blows the chain-tastic competition out of the water. So, how about you go ahead and eat at that other chain, and the rest of us will enjoy the joys of eating locally. I think it's better that way..."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito has good burritos.  They have some other things, too, but the other things are kind of pointless.  It's a giant burrito wrapped in foil, yes, like Chipotle, but better.  Nothing groundbreaking, just a good, solid burrito place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get to this place and then blah....nothing special about this place!  I felt like the food was so so and could see NO REASON to go to OCB when I could get better food at Chipotle..   :(  Servers were bored or un-impressed as I was because robots have more personality."}
{"text":"Reading these reviews is hilarious. Don't people realize that salt = flavor?  Anyway, I go there a decent amount, but mainly for sustenance. Those who think this is somehow better than Chipotle are insane. At best, they're roughly the same. The meats are better at Chipotle, but OCB take better care in preparing your burrito and gives you free guac. Oh, and neither is authentic. But that's not really the point.  I do like that they have horchata (but it's way too sweet) and Mexican coke, though."}
{"text":"I realize many people in Cleveland think they could just as easily go to Chipotle, but I love OCB. They have great flavor profiles and and a distinctive taste I dont get other places. When in need of a quick, filling, affordable bite in Ohio City, I highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. And fresh. So good in fact that I've driven from Lakewood to OC just for these burritos, nothing else. Small and locally owned, but you feel like you are at a friends house. Similar menu to chipotle but so much better. Good price, too."}
{"text":"Looking for quick healthy hit of veggie burrito; found it here. Day of the dead kind of theme here.  Good flavorful food!  Great place right in heart of ohio city."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this cute little place! The service was amazing for being in a city, and the authentic feel knocked chipotle out of the park! The food was especially yummy and fresh. Great price too!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to say this without sounding like a stoner, but my burrito was DANKE! I also couldn't help but notice that my burrito had the same components of my chipotle barbacoa burrito order...only all of the elements were better.  Damned good burritos. I would venture to say one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Perfectly layered burrito!  I have never had a burrito made with such care. It was very good!  Cute part of town also."}
{"text":"Great burritos worth trying!! Came in as they were closing, but they still accommodated a group of three of us."}
{"text":"I really love this place for home style Mexican. The folks in my office like OCB as much as I do and fortunately, they deliver.   Chicken burrito = heaven. The chicken is so flavorful and delicious and it's shredded with no fat, just how I like it. They offer VEGETARIAN re-fried beans, which is a big deal for a non-pork eater like me, and also offer just about all the toppings you'd get at Chipotle...only much better."}
{"text":"The veggie burrito on the menu is really either veggie or bean but not both. If you choose both it will end up being the most expensive burrito."}
{"text":"I so wanted an independent burrito place in my neighborhood to be awesome. But it was a big letdown. Undercooked rice is always a burrito killer."}
{"text":"Messy but tastes pretty good. Comes across more homemade than Chipotle. The mild/sweet salsa is really yummy!! Knowledgeable and friendly workers. Since I can walk there, and its vegan friendly, I will definitely be back! They're also considering extended hours."}
{"text":"Left Midtown for a proper lunch today at the market.  My favorite destination was closed and I've been wanting to get into OCB for some time now.  Pretty awesome.  Simple menu, burritos and tacos..  Simple straight forward options.  Looks fresh.  I ordered a veggie burrito with black beans Pico salsa and mild hot sauce too.  Comes wrapped in a firm foil wrapping for easy noshing.  Friendly staff and great prices.  Will be back. Awesome decor!"}
{"text":"A hand written sign that says the prices this year have gone up will greet you at the counter.  That's fine, However, I have noticed the amount of meat they serve has gone down.  I'm hoping this is a fluke and things will return to the glory of a pile of meat!  Not to mention the small amount of pork I got had a lot of hard dried out hunks in it.  This now makes it harder for me to go want to go back..."}
{"text":"This place is extremely over hyped. I couldn't wait to try this place and when I finally did I was not impressed. I will never go back there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted a burrito: Brothers Burrito - Flour tortilla filled with rice, choice of beans & meat, cheese & lettuce, choice of salsa, guacamole & sour cream... But - sans the flour tortilla. AKA: Naked Burrito When I asked for no rice, they suggested:  The Salad - Bed of tri-color corn chips & lettuce topped with choice of beans & meat, cheese, salsa, guacamole & sour cream. I rolled with that, but without the chips, cheese and sour cream. I asked if i could get (2) soft corn tortillas instead of chips. ok. Sure.  I then asked, since i was not getting rice/cheese/sour cream, if they could put the fajita veggies on. They said it would be 85 cents more. um.  Apparently substituting grilled peppers and onions for: Cheese. Sour cream. Rice. ..costs almost a dollar more. I don't quite understand the logic behind that.   Impressed that guac is included in the base cost.  Impressed that you can get any mix of their vast arrays of salsas added on at no cost. Not impressed one bit that they want to charge 85 cents for a scoop of mixed onions and peppers when I was clearly not getting my monies worth by eliminating 3-4 other ingredients from their main menu item.  So, I decided not to buy one.  Sad. But come on. Really?"}
{"text":"After showing up early for a tribe game to get a jersey, a friend and I decided to walk to Ohio City Burrito for dinner before the game. I've had friends rave about OCB before, but I've always been a bit skeptical because I love Chipotle and the skeletons kind of freaked me out (I know they're a cultural nod, but associating pure bones with tasty food is difficult for me. I think it's why I don't much like The Boneyard.)   Anyway, friend convinced me and I'm so glad because it was awesome! Definitely better than Chipotle. The filling options are pretty similar and either way you're going to be totally stuffed by the end, so there's really only two things that distinguish OCB from Chipotle: 1) everything just seems to have a deeper flavor  2) HORCHATAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  Seriously, next time you're there, get a horchata. I'd stop in even if I weren't hungry just to order the horchata. Perfect amount of sweet and cinnamon and really what put my meal over the top.   Only thing I would have done differently: taken a shuttle back to the game. Both of us cramped up walking back from being too full...."}
{"text":"The burrito was good but not amazing. I had the carnitas and it lacked flavor. Their home made salsa is a must addition in order to give it some extra umpf.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle you'll love this place.  Same system with better food and a quant quiky city vibe."}
{"text":"Gosh, I still love Ohio City Burrito. A lot. Cue yesterday! When one of my other favorite nearby establishments was randomly closed despite their hours. Then I remembered, \"OCB!\" and felt ridiculous, like its that dude I've been friend-zoning for a while. It had been a while, but now that we're back together, I re-see the light, because he's awesome.  I always stick with the Brother's Burrito with guacamole, rice, any meat, veggies galore and salsa. Their ingredients always feel significantly fresher than other places. At OCB, all of their meat is juicy and tender. Whereas at other spots I may just get chicken, you can truly get the pork or carnitas here and be completely happy. I can't explain how satisfying I find their burritos.  The staff is awesome and friendly despite being open quite late. Anyone who I can talk about dogs with is an A+ human in my book and they are always pleasant to see. OCB's awesome, inexpensive eats make them worth the trip every time. When you're checking out at the register, don't forget to ask if they have any horchata or fresh limeade. They make some of the best horchata around town! Viva la OCB."}
{"text":"Every single time I go to Cleveland (which is usually two times a year) I eat here. Every single time."}
{"text":"Was there today for the first time i had a pulled pork burrito.  Too bland in my opinion id stick to chipotle the burritos are better bigger and cheaper.  I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Stopped in here one day before work.  Employees were very friendly.  I ordered three soft tacos and chips.   I originally was going to order chicken but the employees talked me into getting two steak and one chicken, and I'm glad they did.  The steak was awesome. The chips and medium salsa I had were also good.  The salsa had a little sweet flavor which was different, but very good.  Prices were decent and there was plenty of metered parking on a weekday afternoon.  Overall, a very good place for a quick Mexican lunch and had more of that home cooked feel than Chipotle/Qdoba..."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito looks like a cool little indie burrito spot, but the food is horrible! Don't waste your time here. The quality of the food is poor and is much closer to Taco Bell than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way to the airport from downtown . The decor inside was quirky and interesting with a lot of skulls on the wall . I ordered a chicken burrito , with mild salsa . The chicken was a little dry , but I would still rate it higher than chipolte."}
{"text":"Have to come back and bump up my review. I came right after 5 and there was no wait to order. All three ladies working were so friendly and greeted me genuinely asking how my day was going, so already I was in a good mood.   Cue paying. I had a wallet mishap and didn't have my credit card on me. The girls were so nice and understanding even though I was mortified and totally embarrassed. They really went out of their way for me and long story short I have some good karma to pay back.   Ps. Chicken is still my favorite from here  Good food. Good choices. Good people."}
{"text":"O.M.G. this place rocks. personally i've never been too impressed by chipotle, so perhaps i'm biased, but this place blows chipotle out of the water! i always get the same thing because its so good, but ive tried others food and everything is awesome. my fave: the chicken burrito. its delicious shredded chicken in an awesome sauce that i cant even begin to explain. the toppings are great, and they don't just slop everything together out of proportion. and lets not forget to mention, it's cheap! and in a cool part of town. and has a patio which is great on a nice day.   my recommendation (for summer): go kayaking in lake erie (place at the border of lakewood and rocky river) then after working up an appetite braving the erie waters, venture on over to Ohio City for a kick ass OCB!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The Brother's Burrito with chicken though!? Out of this world good.  I hate to compare Chiptole but it's like, you kinda have to. So, sorry Chipotle.   Chipotle has never been a favorite of mine. When everyone was delcaring Chipotle the best Mexican food they've ever had, I wanted to sling shot myself into outerspace because who wants to live on a planet where people believe that?  I came to OCB not really expecting something to blow me away but oooh it did. I'm a big cheese fan and I always order extra cheese on everything (yeah, I know it's unhealthy. Big whoop, wanna fight about it?). The cheese in my Brother's chicken burrito was so very delicious - I don't know what the difference is (maybe having two cheeses is a factor) but boy is it gooood! The chips were phenom too as well as my gauc. Nice and lumpy with NO CRUNCHY NASTY ONIONS in the mix!   I ate half my burrito and took the rest to go. Then got home a few hours later and ate the rest! No leftovers for tomorrow, sadly.  The place is so very quaint, well decorated with a Mexican theme (duh) and the employees were nice (and they were quick which is muy importante!!)  The only thing I was disappointed in was the Horchata. It tasted more like Hornada. Bleh! It was like drinking cinnamon water, no ma'am! Funny thing is, I actually bookmarked and eventually came to OCB for the sole purpose of trying out their Horchata. Buying a burrito was an afterthought, ha!"}
{"text":"After a nght of drinking i was thrillledto see a burrito place!  Most the places up and down the street were really busy and ocb was empty.  Were from out of town so werent sure but decided to give it a go. so glad we did. I ordered a taco and a burrito.  I love the way they make them.  They dont just plop spoonfuls down like chipotle.  They spread everything out evenly so most bites are consistent.  On my taco i got carnitas and while it was good the meat was dry.  but it was ok.  My burrito was amazing though.  the salsa was so flavorful.  Noture which i got ijust pointed at the corn.  i like mild but with some spark which this salsa was exactly.  The refried beans were really really good.  overall just a really good burrito place!  Wish we had one in Detroit."}
{"text":"OCB! One of a kind burrito place. One reason my husband prefers OCB is because you can get guacamole in your burrito for no extra charge. Unlike Chipotle where they want about $3 for a scoop of their guac. And those prices just keep going up.   I like that they also offer the burrito bowl option. And again you can put as many toppings as you want. I had asked for guacamole as well. As I was eating the bowl I felt like I couldn't taste any guac so I went back up with my bowl and asked for some. The server was very nice and gave me a scoop of guacamole and then asked if that was enough or needed more! Great customer service!!   I also like that they have a nacho option. Not just your chips and salsa or chips and guac option at chipotle. I will have to get this the next time I'm in Ohio City. They also have a fish option! What!?! I know right!!! It's a tortilla encrusted Tilapia - will also be trying that the next time! Another great thing they have is Horchata!  It's a drink made with rice milk, vanilla and cinnamon. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"A trip to Cleveland has to include a trip here. Good food, great guac, and a relatively cheap lunch on a great street."}
{"text":"Only place that I could even imagine myself craving like I do chipotle. Really flavorful stuff. And for a unique treat, get a horchata, mexican \"rice\" milk, a cold, cinnamony drink."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh, the service is fast, and the it always tastes good. I prefer it over Chipotle. Would recommend to just about anyone. Always good to help the local businesses!"}
{"text":"Homemade chipotle basically. Really good except they only have shredded chicken.  I got a bowl and it was really huge. Friendly staff. Good guacamole."}
{"text":"I odered soft tacos they chicken didn't not seem seaonsoned at all. I think I'll stick with Chipolte for now on."}
{"text":"There timings are wrong they are open til 9 fridays and saturdays. The food is good basically a more authentic chipotle. I do wish they gave a little more guac and sour cream than the 1 teaspoon they currently give. The food is good the pico didn't look fresh, tasted fine."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 4 times in the last few months, and definitely find it to be a quick and delectable spot to grab lunch. I keep it simple and usually get a basic brother's burrito. I figure it's fresher and healthier than Chipotle or other chain burrito joints, I love to patronize the local businesses, and one burrito definitely makes for two meals."}
{"text":"So, I was on my way to a yelp event tonight and wasn't sure what the food situation was going to be, so I decided to scope the area out once I got near the event location.  I figured I would try something different, quick and not to far since I didn't want to get turned around.  After I got out of the car, I realized this place is two doors down from the event location.  It has a small mom and pop feel to it, so I liked it right away.  There was a nice gal who helped me put my food together after I decided to get two tacos with a pop.  They have quite a few good selections, and I went with the corn tortilla instead of the flour ones. Not that I can tell the difference, but dang, the food here was pretty good.  Staff was friendly and helpful, menu and prices were right on point, and the place is really cute with colorful decorations. I've noticed over the years that sometimes Mexican places are either right on, or their trying to hard to impress you and come off flaky.  Not here! Loved it.  Also, I noticed that when I paid, it was on an Ipad type thingy.  Pretty hip and modern. But here's where I docked them a star. When I was paying, there was a tip section that prompted me to leave a tip. I didn't want to be rude, so I didn't ask. It even told me how much to leave according to the size of my bill.  Um, considering that there isn't a waitress involved, I don't see why I have to tip. I did anyways, but I didn't care for that since I felt obligated.  I know these kids are underpaid and all that, but true waitresses hustle their a$$es off and make like $5 an hour before any tips.  Yes, I would come here again but would probably pay cash next time to avoid the weird tipping thing.  Everything else was really good and I enjoyed my food.  Seating is tight and limited, so I can't imagine more then 6 or 7 people in a party dining here in regards to party size."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place- staff was friendly, place was cute, food was good- until both my friend and I got extremely bad stomach pains/upset stomach a few hours later into the next day. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! They are similar to chipotle, but you are receiving better quality ingredients. BEWARE: Their hot sauce is actually very hot! They have some typical Mexican sodas that taste great, especially their lime one!!! GUAC AND SOUR CREAM ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRICE!"}
{"text":"Where I come from, OCB stands for 'Old Country Buffet'. Many a stupefying food coma began at that place in my college days. Cleveland's OCB still provides the food coma, but with fewer blue-hairs slowing up the line.   Annnywaaay.....  Sean busted himself in a bike crash today. We spent a very large portion of the day in the ER. Five hours, one broken hand, concussion, and messed up shoulder later, we were both STARVING since neither of us had eaten in about 7 hours. We'd always wanted to try OCB and today was the day since it was close, and large portions were in order.   We both had the Brother Burrito, although I chose to skip the guac in mine. LOVE guac, but it just gets too goopy for me when it's inside the tortilla. Both burritos were huge, plenty of food for both of us.   Sean chowed his in literally 3 minutes although I had to peel the foil for him and he was so hungry, I doubt he even tasted it. But he gave it a thumbs up (well, more like a club hand up.) He had both the guac and refried beans rather than black beans in his. Although it was pretty goopy, he found that the refried beans held everything together well. Mine was very tasty with black beans and no guac. The salsas are very good, the flavors balanced, and I found the carnitas to be excellent.   Overall, we're fans of OCB. Nice local alternative to Chipotle and QDoba. Cruel (yet funny) irony of the day: OCB is right next door to a bike shop! We'll be back. Hopefully next time, neither of us will be broken."}
{"text":"We thought the food was very flavorful and the crew working was very nice. My husband had a chicken burrito, and I had a veggie. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I would take Ohio City Burrito over any faux Mexican chain any day. Hands down! Customer service is friendly and food is delicious! Only reason for four stars is because I wish they had a more extended hours. With the location of their restaurant on W 25th, I have to imagine business would double (maybe triple) if they were open later than 8. I know there have been several times I wanted a burrito after a drink or two... Had to settle for something lesser, sadly."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I got the nachos and they were to die for. Same price as Chipotle and it was no doubt 100x better. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito is really not so worthy of a review for there is really not much to say. It is what I would consider an average burrito shop. The burritos tasted fresh, but nothing exciting, only the usual white rice, black beans or re-fried, choice of meat, salsa, etc. They also had small zip-locked bags of their red and blue chips hanging on the wall, which was somewhat unappealing. I could just be me, but tacked zip-locked bags of colored chips feel stale and false to me, not something I am craving to bite into.  These days, the eateries that really do well are the places that can add a bit of modernity, freshness and excitement to their food. OCB has the freshness, except perhaps for their chips, but needs a bit of insight and inspiration. On the other hand, if you are one for the traditional burrito, then you will enjoy this place just fine. I do not plan to be back."}
{"text":"Ohio City Burrito is certainly not bad. But with all the signage in there store they are just asking to be compared to chipotle. And i'll be honest, i just think a chipotle burrito tastes better. Sorry :/."}
{"text":"OCB! The only burrito I can eat in one sitting, and I like it that way :D  Also, the nachos are amazing. Food coma material right there. The only complaint is more guac please! Its really tasty. I also love that they offer horchata."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burritos I've had in a LONG time.  I got the chicken burrito with black beans, everything on it, and the fiery salsa.  I love my food spicy - spicy as in borderline painful.  If you are a person that can handle that level of spiciness, I would definitely go for the fiery salsa as they are not kidding on the name alone.  When I bit into this burrito I got the kick from the salsa right away deep in the back of my throat - at first I seriously thought there was just salsa stuck in my throat but it was the heat from the habanero in the salsa. Soooo good!  Also, unlike Chipotle, Ohio City is kind of OCD when making your burrito in the sense that every single item is spread out perfectly on top of one another, so when you bite into it, you get a taste from every single item in it.  At other burrito places they seem in such a rush that they just throw everything in and I find that one end of my burrito has all the beans while the other end has all the rice, etc.  This place is amazing! Wish I lived in Cleveland so I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Tried this joint for lunch and it was yummy! The staff was very helpful for us first-time diners and there was something for everyone in our group. I opted for the regular tacos with chips and salsa. I don't really eat spicy food and did find their proteins to all have a bit too much spice for me but not to the point that I didn't enjoy my meal.   The pros: *Awesome ambiance *Fantastic customer service - super friendly and eager to explain the menu *Food tasted authentic and delicious  The cons: *Seemed a bit expensive, in my opinion *Very small restaurant and we had kids in our group which was difficult to navigate in such a tight space  Bottom line: I wouldn't choose this place first for mexican but would definitely visit again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a 5 star concept with a 3 star execution. The concept is great, local place fresh ingredients, chill atmosphere. In actually all the food is pretty salty. I went with the carnitas burrito and the carnitas was really good and it was huge. But nothing stood out too me about the other ingredients and it annoyed me that they used normal orange shredded cheese. I just wasn't really impressed with anything and dare I say it.....I would eat chipotle over this any day!"}
{"text":"I'm changing my review to 1-star. The Sysco food truck is parked behind the place 4 days a week. Total crap food."}
{"text":"Being from California and experience true Mexican food; I can say this was not.  They do not offer carne asada, so I asked for chicken.  The chicken was pulled, but was mixed with a majority of bean paste and little chicken and what appeared to be taco packet seasoning.  I was then asked if I would want ice berg lettuce and cheese on my tacos.  Since traditional Mexican food does not have lettuce, cheese, sour cream, etc, I said no, and asked for onion and cilantro.  Instead I got a pile of chopped tomatoes with little to no onions nor cilantro; which was overwhelmed by the tomatoes.  It's sad really, because Mexican tacos are not complicated.  I've had better tacos from roach coaches in California.  Am I doomed to not find an authentic Mexican restaurant in Cleveland?  It appears people from the region who recommend this, do not know Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner this weekend with some friends. Let me start by saying that the staff is great, so kudos to them! 4.5 stars for them. 4 stars for the food.  First time here but have been meaning to try for a while. Got a burrito: white tortilla, guac, white rice, no beans but got the veggies, carnitss, corn, mild and medium salsas, cheese and lettuce.  The burrito was wrapped perfectly and tight - none of that sloppy Chipotle mess wrapping and Each bite had a good mix of ingredients.  Overall very pleased though was hoping the medium salsa would have more kick. I'll have to try the hot next time."}
{"text":"Consistency is the key word regarding OCB. No matter what combination you come up with, you're bound to enjoy your food! The quality of ingredients is always flavorful, always fresh. Big ups to the guac and barbacoa beef. Nom nom!   If you decide to dine-in, prepare for an uplifting vibe with the main seating area surrounded by walls of orange and yellow, decorated with neat artwork and quirky memorabilia. Plenty of hot sauces and napkins ready for that extra heat and cleanup! There always seems to be a good amount employees working in concert, so you'll get your food quickly. That efficient assembly line life!"}
{"text":"Let's get it out there: I'm a huge fan and frequent patron of Chipotle, and to be frank, OCB is in no danger of changing that. However, when I moved downtown, I was stricken with a conundrum: the nearest 'potle is in Steelyards.  Frickin' Steelyards, people! I'm not driving 20 minutes WITHOUT traffic to get my veggie bowl.  All that said, OCB did not disappoint me. I spend a lot of time in Ohio City and I stop in there for lunch every once in a while. All of the salsas are pretty good and the overall taste of my taco salad was solid. I wasn't instantly impressed, but It was a pleasant eating experience overall.  A major turn-off for me is the pre-shredded cheese they use. It's covered in that fine dust (is it corn starch?) to keep it from sticking to itself and it doesn't get melty at all and it makes me sad.  Overall, I could see myself going back there, but I have been told that Orale, which is just down the street, is excellent, so I'll try that next to see what's what.  To be frank again, I didn't like it as much as Chipotle, so take that as you will. I was highly impressed, however, with the drink selection. If you've never had Jarritos before, try one! Tamarind is really good!"}
{"text":"Got a veggie burrito. I liked that the refried beans were vegetarian, but the rest of the ingredients were kind of boring. Chipotle has better guacamole by far and ocb is pretty stingy with the sour cream. Not a bad place to grab lunch if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We eat at Chipotle several times a week due to my wife's allergies.  This served as a good substitution . They are gluten aware and accommodating . Would eat there again if close to west side market"}
{"text":"I literally go here 2-3 times a week for dinner now. I can ALMOST finish the entire burrito now!!! He ingredients are so good and everything tastes so fresh. I can't tell you enough how much I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to OCB!  Yay!  I ordered a chicken burrito with mild and medium salsa to go.  It was large like other burritos, as expected.  The chicken was shredded and tasty.  It had white rice, corn, black beans, lettuce, and salsa.  I was hoping for a knock-your-socks-off experience, but I didn't get it.  Would I go back?  Yup!  But I'm still seaching for amazing burritos.  These are sort of plain, but good.  Maybe I should've gotten the hot sauce.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yes! I have passed Ohio City Burrito many of times and every single time I have said \"Hey, that looks good, I need to try that!\" And have never gotten around to it until recently. Now I am so mad at myself for not going sooner because it's my new favorite place. Ask my Mom, I've told her several times.   I popped in to grab a quick bite because I had a busy day ahead and wasn't looking to spend a lot of time eating. The space is small, and there were a lot of people enjoying their meals, but no one in line. Score! They had a simple chalk board menu with a few options like tacos, burritos and bowls amongst some others. I decided to go with the namesake burrito.   This was a \"build your own\" set up. They start off with sour cream and guac, which is NOT extra (I'm ballin on a budget so this is great news) then add whatever toppings you want! They have multiple salsa and rice options and a good variety of things to add. I'm not big on beans, so they replaced them with fajita veggies. I ordered the barbacoa beef and was warned about the spice, I'm glad I still went with it because the meat had the perfect balance of heat and flavor.   I should also mention that this burrito was GIANT. Like actually huge. And delicious! As I said before I'm now obsessed and if I lived closer I would go everyday, so it's probably a good thing it's a bit of a drive for me. Also worth mentioning, I parked in the lot by west side market and since I was at Ohio City Burrito for less than 1.5hrs, parking was free!"}
{"text":"Recently tried this place and enjoyed the barbacoa burrito. Also got a chicken bowl. I prefer chipotles burrito bowl to here. The burrito was very tasty. The food has more of a homey Mexican taste. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I like this place so much more than chipotle! The chicken and barbacoa together are my favorite! Their meat is so delicious."}
{"text":"Ashamed to admit that this was my first time ever here.  I've either been out of town so much or have simply bypassed it for whatever reason for a few years.   Stopped by around 2PM yesterday.  Nice people, small, and cool space.  It'a a glorified Chipotle and I like Chipotle.  Really clean flavors and very tasty salsas.  I went with the normal 'Big Brother' burrito.  I chose 1/2 shredded chicken and 1/2 barbacoa.  I believe guac is included.  I skipped the sour cream and added black beans and onions/green peppers (a la the Chipotle 'fajitas').  Then you add the other stuff like corn, choice of salsas, lettuce, cheese, etc.  Rolled properly and extremely tight like a big rectangle/log.  I will say it was way too wet inside, IMO, preventing this from being a 5* review.  The woman who was spooning the meat in mostly spooned in marinade with very little of the already very fine, pulled, and super shredded meat.  She bypassed some of the bigger chunks in the trough which was a little disappointing.  Great flavor but it led to a way too wet and sloppy burrito.  Not sure if this is by design or instruction, or, just a random off day.   They have a freaking delicious horchata cooler/dispenser there as well as limeade.  The horchata is just so damn good.  Didn't try the limeade which I'm sure is terrific.  You can tell there is some TLC in what they do there.  It was about $10 for the burrito and horchata.  Looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this place 5 stars I was Impressed with the authentic taste of the ingredients. I regret not eating here a long time ago but better late then never. I had a chicken Burrito with all the fixens , and I had Hachata drink to rinse this lovely Burrito down . I've heard mixed reviews people complaining they don't give you enough Guacamole but it's free your charged for it elsewhere I'm quite sure you can pay more to get extra . The taste they have several options choose to your liking they have several different bottles of sauces you can choose to squirt on your food . The decor is awesome felt like I was in another state awesome inside. Price is actually cheaper then the chain restaurants . Love it! I will be back"}
{"text":"The burrito was good. My friend ordered the shredded chicken, I had the pork. The guac is included in the $6.15 price which is a good selling point. The grandma's salsa style is sweet and slightly spicy. I live a couple of minutes away and will be coming here often. There was a hot sauce bottle there with a skeleton cartoon like the grim reaper on it called Ass Reaper!"}
{"text":"\"Semi healthy lunchtime chicken taco salad on bustling west 25th\" is not a phrase I ever thought I'd utter  as a youth visiting the West Side Market. The immediate area surrounding the market was a rat hole and the people were horrifying(in a character building way). I had a flashback to my youth as I stepped inside OCB and was just overcome with such joy at how much more awesome our town has become over the past few years. Maybe it was because I was showing an out of town friend around. Say about ten years ago, you would automatically take someone to boring Coventry or just emerging Tremont to show off the city. Now, there are almost too many places to choose from.   That said, I was in a good mood and the food here kept the positivity flowing. The portion was huge for what I paid. And while not memorably exquisite, it was fresh and served with pride. The space is big city cute, and the clientele all had looks of determination on their faces. As if this was the power lunch that was propelling them towards some great accomplishment that day. That kind of vibe is infectious and not really something you get in the burbs. I chose not to dine outside(which I normally would do in a heartbeat), because I didn't want to be accosted by any panhandlers or taco thieves. That would have harshed my happy buzz."}
{"text":"Any time you're in Ohio City, you must try OCB! Great little shop that offers good authentic Mexican food. I personally love the Brother's Burrito, but I'm sure anything from there is delicious! Hate to use Chipotle as a comparison, and I'll admit I am a huge Chipotle fan, but whenever I'm in Ohio City I will always stop at Ohio City Burrito for a good burrito! One thing I do appreciate for sure is that you don't have to pay extra for things like guac! The store has a decent amount of seating, but during peak hours it does get pretty busy in there!"}
{"text":"Chipotle before Chipotle existed.   This is a great restaurant that tends to dislike if you say Chipotle in the restaurant.   All the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I love Ohio City Burrito! I used to work nearby and would frequent here for lunches. The food in consistently good, fresh, and full of flavor without being salty. The staff are friendly. They have a loyalty card and you can earn a free burrito! I would much rather support a local business than a big corporation. OCB surpasses chipotle on every level!"}
{"text":"Personally, I would and will go to OCB over Chipotle any day. Pricing is around the same, serving is the same maybe even bigger? Not to mention, I am a local in that area so the commute is way less. OCB moves way quicker than Chipotle which is up there with Melt, which I wont even get started on. Waiting 20 min to eat a burrito which takes all of 2min to make is no bueno in my book. Make your way there, you wont regret it..."}
{"text":"If you want tacos, it's better than chipotle. Otherwise, it's about the same. Their salsas are very good and they have a few more options, but it's nothing to write home about. Great location in Ohio city makes it very convenient and worth the trip."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience at OCB. I should have gone when I was more hungry, i wasn't expecting to get handed a baby when I ordered. Needless to say that thing was huge. I actually think I prefer this over other burrito joints.  Way less salty, which is nice. They have a nice selection of toppings. Same price as anywhere else, but better than everywhere else.   Guac is included in the price. They have refried beans which i love. I get both beans, because they are good my heart. However, the more i eat...  Less salt, more flavor, OCB."}
{"text":"I cam in here, with not too high of expectations and I thought that I was going to be eating something not as good as Chipotle. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of ingredients at this place. I got shredded beef, with tomato salsa, cheese guacamole and lettuce and it was so filling!   The place was kind of hipstery and it was such a cool place to hang out in. It is in Ohio City and the entire area is cool, so get a burrito, and then walk around the area!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of buzz about OCB so we wanted to stop by while we are in town.  I was a bit disappointed, I don't think it was up to my expectations.  My husband liked his burritos better than I did so I think he would give it more stars.  It is definitely a nice addition to the area but I was unimpressed with their spicy salsa and un-flavorful rice and beans.  It was all pretty blah to me.  I hate to use the dreaded \"C\" word but I have to say that their food does have a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"i wanted to try ocb since it opened and i finally went... very friendly workers the food was good, but kinda dry. its like u almost need to add a large portion of salsa to swallow.  i will go again and try ordering a different way and hopefully enjoy it a little more"}
{"text":"This is a very high volume place! Their food is good, their prices are fair, and a lot of their ingredients and food our locally bought right down the street at the West Side Market."}
