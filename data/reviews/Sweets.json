{"text":"So I do check Yelp from time to time, and I made an account today for this place. Just wanted to respond to people saying the ice cream was fake/didn't melt/tasted like \"whip\" cream.. I had it today, enjoyed it, and yes it did melt and it is only February folks. Saw it was family owned, and the workers there were super nice and very friendly with my daughter, so I just wanted to throw a positive review to counteract the weirdly negative ones.  Ice cream was good. There was nothing weird about it. Employees were great. Didn't try the food but I had the Old Fashioned Cherry Amaretto, daughter had a dipped cone, and wife had Butter Pecan (all for about $7). The place is not new (in fact, I remembered having been there when it was a DQ as a kid.. 20 years ago. The windows curve over the last row of tables and it jogged my memory), so I do think a little effort into the atmosphere could help.   The best Ice Cream I have ever had was Greater's in KY, so no it wasn't that. But this place is a solid ice cream parlor to take the family."}
{"text":"So I went to the grand opening to try out the new ice cream, it was amazing.  I've always been a fan of every food item on the menu and have a hard time picking what I want. Everything I order I'm always satisfied with. The problem is I'm always so full but still feel the need to eat even more! I always leave stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Being from Chandler, you went to this place knowing the family or someone that worked there. Now it's SWEETS, and we couldn't be happier! Still great \"family\" atmosphere. Food is yummy and the ice cream is on point! As a family, the ice cream trips just got better!! Burgers, Chicken strips, soft and hard ice cream! Try it for yourself!! Not to disappoint!"}
{"text":"Previously Dairy Queen, same owners, similar menu, just let the franchise drop. Nice people working here, but still basically DQ for better or for worse."}
{"text":"I have been a long time patron of this location, as it was previously a Dairy Queen. I have always had a good experience & have thoroughly enjoyed all of my yummy treats! BUT, now it's even BETTER!!!! They now have included hard ice cream into their menu, I'll never have to go anywhere else. Everyone in my family can get their favorite all in one place! I usually go for the ice cream, but on occasion we have ordered burgers & chicken strips! So YUMMY! The restaurant is very clean. The owners are awesome! Our favorite place just got even better!"}
{"text":"I hate bad reviews. I really do, but hopefully it'll help this business! The burgers are good. Nothing spectacular, but better than most fast food joints. Fries were too greasy, no flavor. I liked that the kids get cones with their meals! ... except when we got to the window, it didn't happen.  I ordered a banana split and it was disappointing. Those things are known for being big, so I planned to split it with my kids, especially for almost $5! It was tiny and seemed to be all whipped cream. From other reviewers, I guess that's what they do with their ice cream? I don't know, but it wasn't good. Next to no toppings. Even the banana was small. I don't know if they cut corners, think it's quality, or it was a fluke, but I won't be going back. Too expensive, foods only ok, and long wait."}
{"text":"Curious to know what they use for ice cream because my husband and I drove thru to get a ice cream cone and it's wasn't ice cream in the cone it was more like super thick whipped cream and it was gross and not even really cold. I held the cone for about 15 min on the ride home and it didn't even try to melt. Needless to say that we won't be going there again."}
{"text":"I want to like all locally owned family businesses.  This used to be a dairy queen and they kept the same menu. The burgers are BETTER...the fries are shoe string like Mc. D. ....the \"blizzards\"...I'm going to yell NO. I didn't think it was possible to make a gross blizzard but it was like a mixture of whipped cream and icing....not ice cream. Wtf. Ew."}
{"text":"this location is now permanently closed!   no longer open!   do not go   location is sold"}
{"text":"I often take my kids to Sweets and let them order whatever ice cream they want and I get myself some food. I've never been disappointed and have always loved their juicy burgers. I always snack off the kids ice cream and it's so good. Now they have hard ice cream in all different flavors. It has become our new favorite after school stop. Very clean restaurant and nice family that owns and operates it."}
{"text":"Never had an issue before today. We were given the wrong food, after trying to call unsuccessfully for 30+ min with only a busy signal, I went down there to get my meal replaced. I was told it couldn't be taken back due to health codes, which I completely understand, but as a paying customer i should have been given a replacement meal, even if the wrong order was taken back and thrown out. When the customers isn't valued and is told that they are the ones at fault that is when it's time to write a review so no one else has to go through the same issue. It's a sad day when you have to check your order without being able to trust what you are getting is correct with out the fear of being out the cost, the food and having the chance of being called a liar :/"}
{"text":"Hello fellow Yelpers ...  Anyone who reads my reviews know I am brutally honest... Be it good or bad!  As for SWEETS only been once.. Ice cream was horrible although I have never tried their food... The ice cream scared us away....  I wrote my review last April and never heard from an owner or employee of this business until they decided to have a RE GRAND OPENING and then alas... I get a message from BERTHA... The owner?    Suddenly she is concerned about our experience... Where were you last April?  Seems they have changed their ice cream and would like us to come to the re opening...  Unfortunately we were unavailable to attend because we do like to help our small local businesses.  I sent the owner a message saying I hope it went well.  No reply!   So I checked recent reviews to find 4 new reviews all within the same time period 3 of which are in the same town... Not Chandler.  I am a skeptic because I find it hard to believe 3 different people would drive to Chandler just for ice cream... Me thinks some friends are writing reviews??  Although I \"could\" be wrong...??  I feel reviews should not be bias if they are to be fair.  We will go back soon and try again and if indeed it is as awesome as these new reviews say....  I WILL delete this and my first review!  I believe in being fair!  Keep posted to see.... Does SWEETS really have the new awesome ice cream we are lead to believe?  Until then  Bon Appetite'"}
