{"text":"Great food, go there often for the home made margaritas, they are excellent. Family run really friendly staff.  Good choice nice patio too..."}
{"text":"Love this place and the location on Central Ave.  There fresh lime margaritas are dream worthy. The enchiladas  are the best!!  A friend who was in the peace corp. told me their Mol√© sauce was the most authentic that they have had outside of South America and Central America. My favorite appetizers are the guacamole and the cheese dip with meat.  Both great with their  house seasoned tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Good service, quick ticket time and live music on the Saturday I ate here. The food quality didn't blow my mind, but it was definitely above average. I would come back."}
{"text":"Truly 5 star authentic Mexican food. I had the chimichanga. Enchilada & Tostada combo. It's was spectacular"}
{"text":"Got my hubby to go the Three Amigos.  Great Choice!  The service and food was wonderful.  We hardly have leftover when we dine out.  But this time we did. The servings was good."}
{"text":"Nice casual place. Food seemed a bit authentic. Good drink specials. Fri $5 Margaritas. PBR always $1.50. Good combinations. Waiter had zero personability. Freezing cold every time we go."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte. The nachos are huge and delicious. Great patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I really liked Three Amigos! The food was fresh and delicious. I got the pork chimichanga. It had pineapple in it which has a nice surprise. The staff the friendly and didn't have to wait long for the food."}
{"text":"I'm trying to think of something that stood out to me about this place but nothing really did. I had the enchiladas Verde. They were okay. The portion size was on the small side for what I expect in a Mexican restaurant. The service was great but the food just fell flat. Everything seemed to be lacking the outstanding flavor I expect in Mexican cuisine. The free queso was worth a try but I probably won't be back, sadly. I've been spoiled by the authentic Mexican restaurants in the area with better prices, bigger flavor, and larger portions.   BUT - if you decide to head to Three Amigos, definitely get a glass of Horchata. It was my favorite thing I had."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Charlotte. The fajitas mix were the best I have ever eaten without a doubt. The fish tacos were packed with flavor. Chips were fresh and salsa not too spicy.   Service was some the most helpful I have encountered. He recommended dishes and sounded genuine. Please do yourself a favor and eat here. Your taste buds will thank me!"}
{"text":"Went here last week for dinner at it was really authentic. Sat at the bar and had some Mexican Beer and Mezcal. The chips and salsa were really good. Ended up ordering a Shrimp Empanada and A Tripa Gordita. They came out really fast and were very flavorful. I had some spicy avocado sauce and was nice and spicy, very fresh."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Service is great, and the portions are ENORMOUS, but a few things on the menu leave a lot to be desired. The taco salad in particular is so bland it makes me think of cardboard; the meat unseasoned and a pool of liquid at the bottom. I'm always a bit hesitant about trying something new here, because so many dishes are incredibly bland. Still a nice place to eat, and the enchiladas are always delicious!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Three Amigos. Went on a Friday night and and after waiting a long time to be seated we were finally seated. When asked if they had draft beer, the hostess clearly had no idea what draft beer meant and said she would get back to us yet she never came back.  We sat there for a very long time watching waitresses go by ignoring us. We had to flag down a waitress to get our drinks. My husband wanted to just leave at that point but I wanted to at least try the food and drinks. The waitress we flagged down said she didnt know who was supposed to have our table but she would take our orders. The waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were. Being from a local brewery I wanted to at least know which ones were lighter in color so I could choose accordingly but she couldnt even tell us that. The food took a very long time to come out and it wasnt even that great. We sadly will not be going back to this restaurant. Protip: Make sure your waitresses know about your local beers you are serving but if you cant educate them at least have descriptions on a menu. The waitress told us she had no idea what they were like because she \"didnt drink beer\" and just showed us the names of the beers she had scribbled down on a piece paper."}
{"text":"We were regulars at the Central Ave location, but really found a better fit here.  This location is so much more consistent on food and drink quality - They have hands down the best marg I've had in Charlotte and their menu is delicious.  Our favorites are the chimichanga and fajitas, but we have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Half price mojitos on Wednesday is $5 where regular price is $6.95. They are not so good at math."}
{"text":"Mexican places can be hit and miss, but this place has been good consistently. Great food, casual, low prices.  What more could you want?  Eat there if you can, to go food typically sucks.  The empanadas (beef) were killer, they're big, fried crispy, hot and fresh, they had a red and a green sauce on the table, both spicy that I dab on. Thursday all you can eat enchiladas (beef & chicken) is a great deal, 4 kinds of sauce, all are good, you don't have to stuff yourself for $9. Burritos are good, meat-rice and beans in them, but very tasty and filling, the 2 burrito meal is a load. The veggie toppings, condiments, sauces, are all fresh.  They have some sort of drink special nearly every day. Give these guys a shot, you'll be glad you did.  --------  Went here again last Friday evening. Nice portions, hot and delicious.  Staff is very friendly which is always a plus."}
{"text":"OMG!  The Mojitos, Tacos, Enchiladas, Chip Dip Trio. Delish!  The service and ambiance was excellent. It would be a major problem for me if I didn't live 30 minutes away!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, not great or even good. The portion size was appropriate for the price and our waiter was attentive."}
{"text":"I looooooove three amigos. The service is always awesome and the food is fantastic. They always seem pretty flexible with my complicated vegetarian orders. This is a restaurant I will always go to for a good burrito."}
{"text":"I love the original location on Central Avenue, this location is alright (3.5). I've been here twice now, so this is a general review of both occasions. They get an extra star for the outdoor patio, as the other location only has 2 tables outside the front door. Margaritas on a warm sunny day? Patio is necessary for this!   On my recent visit, Myself and two other ladies indulged in the dip trio of queso, pico, and guac, in addition to the salsas we had already been served. All of the dips were fresh tasting, especially the pico and guacamole which are two crucial elements to Mexican restaurants, I think!  House made margaritas, light and not overly sour, which I enjoy. Had two of these.   The special of the day was fish tacos, served with black beans and rice, so I ordered these but I was underwhelmed. First of all, our server never brought up the special to begin with, so I had to ask him about them. All he told me was \"they're good\".  Your basic tilapia, fried, with a rather bland mango salsa and a streak of sour cream. Just wasn't mind blowing, and I don't think I'd order them again. They're better at making awesome enchiladas and street-style tacos. This said, my friend who ordered enchiladas was thoroughly pleased with her selection.  Service was not absolutely horrible, but our server certainly did not go out of his way to do well at his job. Never got a name, never came back to ask how everything was after we'd taken our first bites, left empty glasses and stacked plates on our table, and just generally lacked personality. Refills were hard to come by as well.   I'll come back when I'm in the area but I hope service will be better."}
{"text":"This place was good a couple years ago, but lately the quality is off... With so many other great options for Mexican food in the area, we just don't go there any more."}
{"text":"Very flavorful Mexican food.  Chips and salsa selections started a great meal. Not the usual NC Mexican restaurant. Service was enthusiastic and efficient.  If ever in the area at dinner time again I will be back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the sangria and margarita mix!!! The food is on point! Best Mexican restaurant in the 28269 area."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat Mexican food. First time my experience was not that great. But visited again to give them a second chance and tried horchata...the drink was badly prepared, every sip I took just gave me cinnamon taste. Paid for the drink and left it at the Bar and asked for a cup of water instead. Will never come again."}
{"text":"Sat sept 17. Picked up a takeout order. Food was fantastic. The four of us were very happy. Nice people I felt at home when I arrived  Thank you Went again for take out sat 9/24. A great experience again!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal, but it wasn't anything special.  Great beer selection, especially for a Mexican place.  I would go back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican Restaurant.  The guacamole and salsa are fresh and the best I've had.  Plus they give you an enormous amount of food so you have enough to take home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Wow. This is a great place to eat. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for good Mexican food. This staff was kind and great. We will def be back here to eat."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times, twice for lunch with a friend and then brought my wife for dinner. Excellent food, large servings, excellent service and very reasonable price. Love the grilled fish tacos and vegetable fajitas! The owner and his wife, Manny and Paulo, are frequently present, and like all the staff are very friendly and cheerful. I enjoy eating outside under the umbrellas for the outdoor and quieter experience."}
{"text":"Thank you Three Amigos!!!  In fact, goodbye Loco Lime and hello to my new favorite Mexican spot.  Excellent, fresh margaritas, great tequila selections, and the food is wonderful as well. Guacamole - fresh, chunky, flavorful and I could stop in just to eat a serving of this alone.  But there's so much more.  And it's so close to home.    Welcome to the neighborhood Three Amigos.  Stay awhile!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas Mixmaster were great. Paloma was great. Chips were great. They are associated with Sabor Latin Street food which is great. Gets busy, get there early or you will wait."}
{"text":"Three Amigos is the best Mexican food ever! It is so authentic and tastes so fresh. The queso is my favorite and the guacamole is to die for. Made so fresh and so yummy! The margaritas are also delicious and made with fresh fruit & the fishbowl ones are so big and good. Get the chimichangas with shrimp, they are amazing & so much food so you will have yummy left overs as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.. Ordered carne asada taco plate. My only complaint was the steak wasn't chopped up in order to place in tacos. I was provided with two big slices of steak. The rice and beans was great!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Cental Ave location a couple times and thought it was pretty good, but I had an awesome meal at my first visit at this new location so I thought I'd share.  I was very impressed with my meal and service at this location. It could very well be the best plate of mexican cuisine I've had. The staff was friendly in this new location which also brings quite a better parking situation and more seating than the Central Ave location."}
{"text":"Went for take out tonight and part of my order was missing. Had to go back and get the rest of it. When I got home with the food part of the order was not made correctly as requested. Seems the last few times that I have been here there has been some sort of issue."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The chicken was so tender and the rice was amazing. This is so much more authentic than any other one I have been too. The onions on my enchilada were so flavorful. I cannot wait to come back down to eat here again.  The extremely large margarita with the corona was great. I dont like syrupy sweet, so I hesitated to order this, however, it was perfect. Loved the savory season on the side. Our waiter was adorable and very good. This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Yay I'm a fan! I just moved here and it's definitely been a little tough to find some good mexican food. This place is the best I've had so far, but there is room for improvement- mainly just the authenticity factor.   The food itself is good quality, fresh, and well portioned. I was in a party of 3, and we each had a drink (mojito, sangria, and marg- gotta taste the whole menu right?)- the sangria was my fave-- great flavor, robust taste. My second fave was my mojito- but there may have been a tad too much sugar in it and it could have been mulled a bit more. Still, good drinks.  Had the 3-A nachos. They were a good portion with shredded chicken, but honestly, they lacked flavor and salsa. The top was a bunch of iceberg lettuce with sour cream. I asked for black beans instead of refried beans which are supposed to come in the nachos. They were fine, but the table next to us got the guac in a LARGE dish...so I would opt for that next time!!  I had three tacos for the $2 taco Tuesday special...and eh, they were fine, but they didnt come with any spice and there was none at the table. I asked the waitress for some medium salsa and she brought out a creamy green sauce that was honestly not that great.  My two dining partners were SUPER satisfied with their dishes though, and I would definitely opt for those next time.  Chicken fajitas was one of them, and the other was carne asada. Carne asada came sliced with tortillas (choice of corn or flour) so really, it was almost like fajijtas.  We finished with an order of churros. I think there were 5-6 churros in the order, and they were churros rellenos (with the cream inside)..SO GOOD! I wish they came with chocolate sauce, but they actually came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that we dipped them in- very good!!   Next time, I'll stick with fajitas and a sangria or beer ($2 beers on Tuesdays!) and ask for extra salsa for my meal- and all will be great!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! Great servers, great chefs, and great food! The chimichanga is the way to go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast and courteous service. Very reasonably priced. Comfortable and welcoming dinning area. Chips and Salsa were delicious and fresh. Fajitas were awesome and guacamole was lacked any spice and they charged us extra to add jalape√±os."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner on a packed Friday night.  The food  tastes like home cooked and definitely flavorful."}
{"text":"The service was fast. The food was very good and prices are reasonable. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican spot. It doesn't look like much from the outside, it looks like a Typical Shopping Center Mexican food spot but don't let the looks fool you.  Their chorizo is delicious, and a must try in the queso dip. Don't miss out on the specials, $2 tacos on Tuesday and all you can eat enchiladas on Thursday (the mole ) The food is always incredibly fresh and  authentic. We have never been disappointed in the staff, after a few times dining there they already know us."}
{"text":"The place was empty and the service was still really slow. I ordered the guacamole appetizer, but I didn't get it until my Naked Fajita came out. The guac was really wet for some reason, but the fajita was ok. About as generic as a fajita can get. Nothing spectacular. I read on another review that the margaritas were great, but I wasn't impressed. Definitely used bottled sour mix, NOT the fresh juice I read about. My friends swear by this place, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, we come here once every two weeks if not more. The food is fresh, stellar service, incredible menu, and it's beyond delicious. 3A nachos (could be a meal and feed three people), gringos tacos, anything with shrimp, the burritos are on a new level with the melted cheese on top...  nothing is bad. The margaritas are tasty too. Must try."}
{"text":"UPDATE November 2015.  It's been almost a year since my last review, and we actually go to Three Amigos a lot. The service, as referenced below, can be slow ... sometimes. It wasn't us, though - sometimes it's great, sometimes it's a little slow. (The visit referenced below was definitely an anomaly).   The authentic Mexican tacos are delicious, but the best thing to get is the tortas. Massive, meaty sandwiches with more flavor than I know what to do with. Seriously, the Torta Cubana is a perfect \"I just ran a half marathon and mowed the lawn and now I'm hungry\" meal. Carne asada beef, thin sliced hot dogs, queso fresco, bacon, lettuce, and probably a bunch of other stuff I'm forgetting are piled between two massive pieces of bread. It's enough for two but you won't want to share. Kid options are typical for a Mexican place.   And the service, while sometimes slow, is always good. They're quick to address issues and they're great with being flexible with menu requests, and always really, really nice.   (original review follows) Great food, lousy service. Came on a moderately weeknight. Every step of the meal took a long time - waiting for a server to acknowledge us, waiting for our food, waiting to order dessert, waiting for the bill. Our dinner plates were never cleared, even when dessert arrived. Strangely, it seemed to be our table - four parties came, ordered, ate and left after we ordered and before we left. Service was pleasant and our food was as ordered. It just took a really long time.   The food was good, and they have a nice variety of taco fillings, including tongue and tripe."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday. The restaurant was mostly empty and we were greeted and seated straight away. The server was courteous and efficient. The food was fresh and prepared to our liking.   I had the chicken fajitas. They were great. I would get them again unless I decide to explore the menu further.  The free queso dip when checking in on Yelp is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This has to be some of the BEST food over eaten in my life!! Not to mention some top notch service!   Service- everything you want in a server, we received last night! He was attentive, but not overly attentive. He answered questions but also made suggestions. He double checked everything to make sure the order was correct. He engaged in the right amount casual conversations. We ordered take out and he was very attentive to details- plastic ware, napkins, making sure we had we wanted/needed (sour cream, extra tortillas) etc He was just a perfect server!! 5stars for him!!  Food- there are no words to describe how tasteful the food was.. The Ceviche or Shrimp cocktail thing they had on the Appetizer menu.. O-M-G!! It was sooo good, I ate the left overs for breakfast this morning!! For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Soup.. man, that broth was SO GOOD! You could really just taste the blend of all amazing spices in both the chicken soup and the Ceviche flavorfully awesome! I applaud any restaurant that uses cilantro appropriately! You could really taste the freshness of it in both dishes and it didn't go unnoticed!!   Thanks for an AMAZING MEAL!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"It's our new favorite place for Mexican food. The servings are very filling, and delicious! The mojito Cubano was smooth and so tasty. The menu has great selections. Our 10 year old repeated that his shrimp quesadilla and the food was great over a dozen times. And all the staff was friendly and courteous. We will be sure to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! I ate here today with two friends and both the food and the Marquitas were very good.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here because of the other good reviews & I must say we were not steered wrong! The grilled fish tacos were divine and the guacamole is some of the best I've had! Another high note is the mango mojito"}
{"text":"What a difference new management, new menu options, food presentation, and a friendly staff can make!  I've been meaning to write this for many months but just now getting to it. Well done Three Amigos!  From the gals who sit at the back table"}
{"text":"The first time I visited three amigos the experience was very good. Our waiter was friendly and although it was busy, the food was excellent and the service was fairly quick.   However, after visiting three amigos for a second time recently, I don't think I'll be back again anytime soon. Our party was waited on by Camille. She was not very friendly, failed to refill our chips and salsa, forgot to bring some items back after being asked, and brought back incorrect bills for 3 of the people in our party.   In addition to the poor service, the margaritas primarily consisted of juice and most of the dishes we ordered did not have a lot of flavor.   I hope to return again, but for now, I will probably choose another Mexican restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so good and the service is amazing. All the staff are so sweet and they make sure you have everything you need!"}
{"text":"We used to eat here when it was Loco Lime and the food was great. Now, not so. Ate here about 2 years ago and the food and service was terrible. With all the good reviews on NextDoor we decided to give it ago once more.  Sorry, but it failed miserably. We got our food to-go and ordered the steak burrito and steak tacos with rice and beans for both.  The burrito was fairly large but was severely lacking in flavor. Good thing it had cheese on it because there was none inside. The steak was overcooked and hard. Reminded me of my mother's hockey puck hamburgers. Same for the tacos, hard, overcooked meat. The rice lacked flavor as well as the beans. I make better at home.  I was offered a $5 margarita while I waited for the food and while the tequila was o.k. the overall flavor of the drink was very bland. Not a good experience and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that this location is just as good as Central Ave!  I was working in Huntersville and I saw the Three Amigos logo out of the corner of my eye, I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I went to work and made a plan for everyone to have a margarita after work!  Who could say no to that?  I ordered what I always order, guacamole and chicken enchiladas verde.  Delicioso! If you like spicy food, make sure you ask for the salsa verde, it's pureed jalapeno. You're welcome! lol The guacamole with a drizzle of the salsa verde makes me sing (and cry from hotness sometimes)  This atmosphere is shiny and new, but it's in a newish shopping center, everything can't have charm like Central Ave!  Three Amigos always has drink specials, kid's nights, contests, make sure you read the board!!!"}
{"text":"The chips here are amazing! We had the chicken fajitas which were delicious but the portion didn't seem to match the price. The service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've had here in Charlotte! Everything about my experience stood out as above par: the food was excellent, the atmosphere was wonderful , and the staff was amazing!   My husband and I decided to try it out one night while my parents were in town--which is always a risky move-- but it was well worth the risk. We were all extremely satisfied, and each had an amazing meal. All of us are extremely picky when it comes to authentic Mexican food (all being from Southern California), so to leave with all of us being more then excited is really a feat!   We started our meal with a trio of Pico De Gallo, Guacamole, and Queso without Chirozo. Each dish was fresh and unique. And the chips had a flavorful salt on them that only added to the flavor of the dips.  Our server was amazingly helpful with the menu, and very friendly. He explained that each dish could be made vegetarian no problem, so we could easily order anything. I was very excited! He even checked to make sure their mole sauce was vegetarian, which it was! I love mole sauce, but rarely find a place that makes it vegetarian. So, of course I ordered their veggie mole enchiladas! Fantastic choice: full of flavor, fresh ingredients, and an unique pallet.   Between all of us, we ordered Tacos, a Chimichunga, and Carne Asada. None of us were disappointed, and we all already want to go back.   Also, shout out to the best margaritas! No mix, just lime, tequila, and triple sec. I'm pretty sure they go heavier on the triple sec then the tequila and that's why they are a little sweeter then most, but it totally works for them. Strong but sweet drinks: I can already see this being a favorite establishment, and I've only been there once!   Amazing, just absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Not sure where my extreme like for Mexican came from but I was in the mood for some horchata and nachos. My love and I found this place right here on Yelp! and decided to give it a try. We were seated promptly and we ordered horchata and sangria. The complimentary nachos with salsa were also brought out quickly and we took advantage of the free queso with our check-in. We ordered the mixed fajitas and grande chicken nachos. We sat and inhaled almost two baskets of nachos, and we nursed our drinks waiting for the food. Then we saw a couple that came in after us leave rubbing their stomachs. And then we realized just how long we had been waiting. Our waitress came over to assure us that our food was on its way. Then another family left, and another. Before we knew it, it seemed as though the place was empty. People were out on the patio and we saw food whizzing by us, but NEVER in our direction. The waitress came over again to say the food was on its way. After about ten more minutes and us realizing that we had been there for 45 minutes and were still hungry, we decided we were more aggravated and wanted to pass on the food. We flagged her over and said we'd take the check for the drinks but they could keep the food. She insisted the kitchen was backed up. REALLY?!?! Because we kept seeing food emerging from the kitchen going to people who had come in after us. In the end, the food was comped and we left hungry. I took the nachos to work the next day. They were ok. I can see how they may have been great if I had the opportunity to eat them when first prepared. I seriously doubt we go back to this place in this lifetime. I plan to be a jungle cat in my next lifetime so I guess I wouldn't be back then either. Thanks...no Thanks."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner. It was my first visit and I'm so happy I picked it!   I got a blended strawberry margarita to start and because I checked in on Yelp I got a free queso dip and it was so good we ordered a second one. I liked the combination plate. I got a chimichanga and a gordita both were amazing and filling.   Honestly everything we got was really good and I'd go back anytime. Remember strawberry margarita and queso and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Another local Mexican hot spot. After moving to the area a while ago, I did spot this place out, always in passing, and kept forgetting to roll back to try it out- until now.   This place is not much, but it is fairly impressive in service and quality. The specials here are pretty sweet. On Tuesdays, I can walk out the door paying only $2 per each Mexican draft beer and taco. Great tacos- chicken, beef, and chorizo. All of which are spot on.  Haven't ordered anything off their menu yet, but others plates looked pretty fresh.   Their salsa verde is absolutely phenomenal and, in my opinion, the best around. Even if you aren't big on spice, try it, has some great flavors.  The space is small and not as cozy as your usual Mexican joint, but has good decor and great staff. They have TV's with sports on generally.   Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"A quaint, little Mexican restaurant.  Area: The layout is pretty open, and it seems like a great place for small or large parties. The tables were clean.  You get your standard chips and salsa. With Yelp check-in, you can get a free queso, which is what I did. The salsa was a little watery and it wasn't my favorite. The queso was pretty good for it being free. I probably wouldn't actually order it though.  Food: I ordered a plate of enchiladas verde, which are tortillas filled with chicken covered with green salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and avocado served with rice and beans. My brother ordered a one taco + one burrito with chicken and chorizo. The food took a little longer than expected, so we were getting pretty hungry. When the good came out, we were pretty surprised about the amount of food. It's slightly more pricy than most Mexican restaurants I have been to, but the amount of food definitely explained it!   My dish was really good. I enjoyed the enchiladas and the green sauce. The tomatoes and lettuce tasted really fresh and the avocado was ripe. My brother rated his dish a 4.5/5.   Service: It started out well with the waitress being very attentive, but after we got our dishes, the service was a little spotty. We finished our dinner, but our waitress didn't attend to us for a while/was in the kitchen so we awkwardly sat there waiting for our check.  Overall, it was a good experience and there's a high chance I would go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the gals for Friday $5 margaritas! Delicious! They were made with fresh lime juice and so tasty! The salsa was deliciously fresh as well."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Mexican food. I really did not enjoy it. Everything has way to much cheese on or in it. The workers are extremely friendly but our waitress kept asking if we need a to go box when we weren't even done eating. While it is local and they have some good specials. I'm going to try it again and give them one last chance."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good stuff about this place. The food is excellent; always fresh and delicious. But their service is what makes them stand out. They are always super nice to the kids and take good care of them.   Also this is a great place to go on your birthday. They always make you feel right at home. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service I've ever had. Our sever Rachel seemed like she was under the influence and just wanted to socialize with her coworkers. We had to ask several times for items we ordered. We asked for more chips and we never got any. Water never got refilled. She couldn't even have the excuse of being busy because there were only two tables. And we asked for two checks and everything was literally split down the middle. At this point we were just ready to get out. I couldn't even enjoy my food. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"This is certainly not good news for my waistline that 3 Amig's has now opened in my neck of the woods.....not good at all.  I've already gone 3 times and they've only been open 2 weeks:-)  I was so excited to see that 'opening soon' sign.  The food is just as good as the central avenue location and I've even tried a few new dishes but I still love the enchiladas.  One of the nights I dropped in was a Friday and they had live music.....sweet!  I am so in love with this place, it's the perfect replacement for that awful Loco Lime that did the area a favor and closed......."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food for Charlotte burbs!  Don't get the taco Tuesday special tacos unless you only want the meat, onion, & cilantro. No, I'm not exaggerating!  No cheese, no lettuce, no order!  Went with build my own combo & was very pleased. Also, the $2  beers can't be beat!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Party of 6. We all ordered different things. Nachos with chicken, chicken burrito, beef chimichanga, cheese enchiladas..... everything was fine but average. Very very average.   The pluses - Service was very good!  Parking was easy!"}
{"text":"This is our go to for Mexican. The food is great, the service is even better, they are always fast and attentive. I love their margaritas and need more of their flautas in my life. The cheese dip was a little watery and costed a little more than other places, but the rest of the dinner made up for it."}
{"text":"Great food.  Authentic flavors. Large portions. 6 tap beers.  All good. Specials every day. Music on Sundays.  Attentive and authentic staff.  Wife and I come here all the time."}
{"text":"They have a veggie quesadilla that's loaded with cheese - a little wet, but very tasty. I love the margaritas! Service can be hit or miss in terms of order accuracy. Chips and salsa are served at all tables. The salsa is delicious. I've never seen the location by 201 Central have more than a few patrons."}
{"text":"My husband and I yelped Mexican restaurants in Huntersville. We stumbled across this place. They had a free queso dip with Check in. It was fabulous! We got the enchilada mixtas. They were even better! We will be back! Love the hot sauce they give you at table with salsa!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Drinks came at the end of the meal when we ordered them before the meal. Salsa tasted like marinara sauce. Margarita was good. Service was slow and not attentive."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Mondays was what brought me here but I can see it being a quick dinner spot. Portion sizes are huge. Service friendly and quick.  Food was very good. With such reasonable prices I actually tried something different:)"}
{"text":"Dropped in for the first time on a Thursday night after a long drive and because my husband had a rough day, and Mexican food always cheers him up. Much to his delight, we were pleasantly surprised to find we had come on a night the offered all you can eat enchiladas and 2 dollar Bud and Bud Light. Everything was so good! The enchiladas were served with your choice of sauces, ranging from mild queso to a spicy roja sauce. You also had a great choice of protein options (chicken, beef, pork, and chorizo.) Our server was especially nice and very fast; which we both really appreciated. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I have eaten here a few times and the food was ok. Nothing special but the location and drinks are good. Today,  it was obvious the rice was reheated. There was more rice than chicken in the burrito. The chicken wasn't seasoned. I told the waiter the rice was old, he told me it wasn't. If you want good Mexican food go to Three Amigos on CENTRAL AVE IN CHARLOTTE."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location three different times and unfortunately do not have much good to say.   One time our waitress completely forgot about our table. She took our drink order and did not come back for 30 minutes. When she did come back, she told us that she forgot about us and that we could leave if we wanted to. We thought the comment about leaving was very strange and it made us feel like she didn't want us to eat there. This waitress still works there, by the way.  Tonight I ordered the Naked Fajita, which is under the \"Fajitas\" section. The description under the \"Fajitas\" header says that all fajitas are served on a skillet and served with rice, beans, tomato and avocado. The Naked Fajita description says it is served with a side of lettuce to use as wraps.  When I got my fajita, it was not served on a skillet. It did not have rice, beans, avocado or tomato. I questioned the waitress. She left to ask someone about it and came back and told me that the Naked Fajita did not come with any of that stuff. I told her that the menu said it did. She left and came back again with a take-out menu (which is not what I looked at when I ordered... I looked at the regular menu that was given to me by the hostess), where it says in italics that the Naked Fajita did not come with rice and beans. I told the waitress that this statement was not on the regular menu, and she replied that the dish didn't come with rice and beans.  Oooookay. So then I told her that really the main thing I wanted was the fresh avocado. No where on either menu did it state that this was NOT included on the Naked Fajita. She told me that the avocado only comes with all of the other fajitas, but not the naked one. What??? Finally I just asked for a side of guacamole, which I paid $2 extra for.  Based on my experience, I think this restaurant has horrible customer service. I will never eat here again.  UPDATED: After my review, the owner of this business contacted me apologizing for my experience. Because of this, I've upgraded my rating from 1 star to 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is a great local Mexican place.  We try and eat there about once a month and I typically get the naked fajitas.  They are your typical fajitas but served on lettuce wraps.  Really cuts down on the carbs and brings out the flavor of the meat.    They also have a fine selection of beer and a great local atmosphere.  Way better than your typical chain Mexican joint but not quite as good as Tex Mex you find in Texas or out west."}
{"text":"I must say best food ever & service improved- I previously wrote a negative review when new owners took over I was very disappointed but since it is so hard to find good mexican food in Charlotte I came back at Manny (owner's) request this place took a 180 and has been hitting a homerun every time we visit, Thank you Manny"}
{"text":"The staff is great!!  The food is awesome...   They are always right with you and the food is fast."}
{"text":"Horrible. Took forever to get a high chair and then the menus...$5.50 for cheese dip and it was 90% water! I def do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte. I highly recommend the nachos supreme, taco salad, or fajitas. Very friendly staff and great service. We go here around once a week and this is our favorite place to eat in all of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed with the entire package this establishment has to offer. The staff, beverages, food and atmosphere was perfect. I'm a huge foodie and extremely picky on Margaritas yet their fresh squeezed sour mix is perfectly blended and FRESH! I would highly recommend this restaurant and best part is they are family friendly with a perfect outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"By far our worst Dining Experience ever !!we have lived in Highland creek for 5+ years and thought that we would visit this restaurant that is so close instead of going to the Concord Mills to us and based on the reviews, we thought what the hell. Boy we were sadly mistaken.. It was an utter disaster from soup to nuts..Let me begging n by saying that this hotel is like a diner/ cafe aka Waffle house with \"zero\" ambience with wooden chairs which were chipped in many places. We were placed in Table 1 and served by Adasary.  The worst part about the dining experience was our table was so close to the next maybe barely 1 foot as it felt someone right ovr you shoulder- no privacy at all.   The server Adasary was very unfriendly with \" No Smile\" at any point she conversed with us and we had a 4 year old with us. It took her forever to serve water and chips to even pick up the check so everything took forever from start to finish although the hotel was less than  half full when we left.  Regarding the food, it was very mediocre and again when they served the Fajitas I ordered, the tortillas were served after 10 minutes as if it was not part of the dish..  We were absolutely appalled for the lack of privacy at the closeness pf the table, unfrindly server, errors in serving the food by the busser...  Would not recommend this restaurant !!"}
{"text":"I came with my family to try the chicken mole. Having had many dinners at my Latino friends, I had come with certain expectations and I'm glad to say those expectations were met. The mole was excellent. Not too spicy to burn your tongue off, but not too mild either. It took a while for the food to come, but I've come to understand that something like this is worth waiting for. An enjoyable and satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best mexican around.  Get the enchiladas you can't go wrong. However the star of the show is the mole sauce which is unreal.  I would put that in anything."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican food. It was good but on par with less expensive Mexican spots. The restaurant was nice and clean, and the presentation of the food was great. Their queso was delicious but it's a whopping $4.95! If we didn't have a free coupon I would not have paid that much for it since one of our favorite Mexican restaurants serves free queso. Overall the food and atmosphere were good, but their prices are too steep. I'd stick to my regular spot unless they lowered their prices since the food is pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Found this little gem after leaving the RenFaire.  Quite a few others had the same idea so our table of 8 had a 45 min wait.  The layout is odd with very little \"waiting space\" so the 45 min felt much longer.  The resturant has an industrial edge without the cheesey mexican decor.  It was clean.    The salsa is very good. The house special hot salsa was green, tangy, but not really hot. The cheese dip was so-so and lacked flavor. 2 of our party are vegetarian.  They had the zucchini enchiladas and the shrimp chipolte.  Both were excellent. The remainder of the party had more typical fare....only nothing is exactly typical.  Its more mexican fusion than standard mexican. The pastor had pineapple; the tripe taco was deep fried so the tripe \"snapped\"; the shredded beef was very tender and well flavored. The flavor and portion of food was generaous. The manager, Mario, stopped by several times to check on everything.   I deducted a star for A) the trash in the restrooms had overflowed and B) the sanitation score, while high 90s, was hidden behind a plant (a no-no).  I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area. I like the enchiladas, tortas, tacos and can't wait to try more! This is a small restaurant in a strip mall but it has a small patio section on the side and probably the reason I'm so partial to this place is the small bar with maybe six taps that always have my favorite local breweries on tap! (Noda & Birdsong) I'm working up the courage to request a half coco loco & jalape√±o ale, let me stop. The staff is really pleasant and they have some good meal and drink specials every day of the week. I'm pretty sure this falls on the owners of the strip mall but the sidewalk and parking spaces could use a pressure washing as I've encountered a few messes on the way in. Other then that I plan on spending several fall evenings on that patio so keep up the good work three amigos!"}
{"text":"First visit and it will not be my last.  First good sign, the salsa is fresh with just the right amount of kick. I was there for lunch and tried the Jalisciences, which my courteous waitress described as enchiladas topped with lettuce pico fried potatoes and steak.  The dish arrived and the portions were huge. I expected slices of grilled steak but surprisingly got a large rolled up steak which looked and tasted like flank. It was well prepared, seasoned great and accompanied the rest of the meal. I ordered chicken enchiladas, 3 were covered with fresh lettuce, a few small freshly fried thin potatoes (chip size) and pico with a small amount of Mexican cheese. The dish needed a little bit of the aforementioned salsa for my taste but was absolutely delicious and because of the portions very satisfying. I normally do not go into this much detail but the menu description does not do this selection justice. It is awesome.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and exceptional cuisine. I've been to multiple locations and this is definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"The food is so good. I'm lucky they are only a block away from my house. I love all their sauces esp the green creamy one. The tortas are my favorite.  I have tried them all. The enchiladas are phenomenonal too!  I recently tried the small portion smothered fries....WOW! very tasty and u get tons of fries! I had to ask if that was the small portion! Service is great too! They always have drink specials AND they use fresh squeezed fruit in their margaritas!"}
{"text":"There is nothing \"authentic\" about the food that this restaurant is serving. I would like to know what region of Mexico that the previous reviewers have traveled to in order to make their statements valid.  Let's start with the chips' salsa. Theirs is nothing more than commercially canned generic sauce that has had cilantro and onions added. Other reviewers say it is fresh meaning made from scratch, which it is not. If you have ever had homemade, you would know the difference. I ordered the \"Mix-itas\", which is supposed to be equal parts shrimp, beef, and chicken fajitas. The shrimp was rubbery from overcooking, the chicken minimal, and it contained about three pieces of beef, which I had to dig through a pound of tasteless previously frozen onions and peppers to find. They serve it with canned beans and just-add-water bland rice. It did not come with sour cream or guac...just two slices of avocado. I did not have any issues with service, however, I was there after lunch and there was only one other table. That factor makes me question the kitchens' attention to their cooking. My iron-stomach gassed and churned the rest of the day and evening, which makes me wonder about the freshness of the ingredients...especially the rubber shrimp. They can not offer enough coupons to make this a worthwhile dining experience."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The best Mexican food I've had since living in Florida. It's all fresh, and they have some different geographical cuisines for you to try. Sometimes the service can be a little slow, but the personality and the food definitely make up for it! If you're in the area, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The service was good. Our waitress was nice. The food wasn't very impressive. The queso and salsa was very watery,  pico de gallo was dry. My husband ordered a steak taco salad and it had minimal ingredients. (Our basic salad at home is more tasty) My chipotle shrimp was okay. There was an up-charge to switch out my salad to plantains. The plantains were best part of my dish, so glad I made that decision."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the neighborhood. I visit pretty regularly and it's one of the very few places I order new things each time.   I have enjoyed all of the Dominican style meats and other new variations on traditional Mexican food.   Great beer selection and the staff are always very friendly to my daughter and I.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Dropped in here because we had heard so many good things about Three Amigos.  Always looking for a good place for some Mexican food.  Three Amigos was ok.   The chips and salsa were done well.  That is always my first sign of a good Mexican place.  I had the chicken verde enchiladas and my wife had the fajitas.  I wasn't that impressed with the enchiladas as the Chicken seemed dry.  My wife really liked the fajitas as they were fresh.    The service was good and we never were out of drinks or chips.  Even thought the place was packed they were very attentive.    Overall the place was good. Would like to try a different entree next time"}
{"text":"Solid guilty pleasure Mexican joint! Service is a little hit or miss. We were told once we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table despite seeing several available. My party of 2 ended up sitting at the bar, which was fine, but sometimes a table is more comfortable. Great fajitas (if you're looking to go paleo!) and BIG portions. Overall, it's a good spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's always consistent and never disappoints. They have excellent margaritas and also have a great low carb lettuce wrap option instead of tortillas. Very good customer service as well."}
{"text":"Very good food and very good portions of food. Atmosphere is nice and the quality of food seems good. Seems authentic to culture and restaurant staff is very nice. Thank you."}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful and friendly from the moment we came in. The portion sizes were both big on our dinners.  The only negative was the temperature of the food. From chips and queso dip to our meals, everything was barely warm. But definitely will go back and try here again."}
{"text":"Loved the steak taco salad and house margarita! I got strawberry and mango mixed. We sat at bar. Staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! They have great lunch specials and daily specials that make the price right! Service is friendly and attentive. I haven't tried anything I didn't like, but the chimichanga is my favorite dinner and the enchiladas/taco combo is great for lunch!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in a shopping plaza in Huntersville. The atmosphere was cute, nice music that wasn't too loud and a few TVs for anyone who enjoys sports. They had some awesome Daily Specials as well as a delicious looking Menu. I came here with my brother one Thursday night for dinner. It was the $9 all you can eat enchilada night and $2 bud lights/ bud. I got a beer and he got a Mexican Coke( his favorite) and we both indulged in the enchilada special. It did not disappoint. Homemade sauces for each enchilada( red, green, queso, & mole). All very delicious. We each got 2 plates (12 total enchiladas) and the 2 drinks for under $25. So good. Service was slower then wanted but it was busy so I understand. Will be returning !"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Service was great, food was DELICIOUS, and the decor is perfect. I will 100% be back here.   Chicken tacos were awesome. Tip: ask for the jalape√±o salsa."}
{"text":"Surprised to find this place popular even on late Sunday afternoon. The service was great and the prices were reasonable. The food was the standard Mexican fare but there were a few  interesting dishes. I had the torta cubana with egg and chorizo in a sandwich. It was delicious although I took out the hot dog inside that I found salty. Did I say good service? And 6$ mojitos?"}
{"text":"I don't think this is quite Mexican. The dishes are there, but there's something not right. No refried beans, the guacamole had hardly any avocados in it. They have Dominican specialties on their menu and things like fries that aren't typically at mexican restaurants, so possibly they specialize in that and not Mexican. The service was ok but nothing great. It was a busy night, though. We won't be returning. Too many restaurants out there to try to return to a blah place."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is great! Food is not authentic Mexican, but it's always fresh and tastes good. The drinks are awesome! The service is fantastic. All the waitresses and waiters I have ever had there have all been fantastic. Love how they are friendly, welcoming, and go above and beyond to always make my family feel welcome. Love this place'"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and yummy chips and salsa! I'm typically a chimichanga girl, but I ventured and got the fish tacos and I'm glad I did! This will definitely be our go-to Mexican food spot from now on. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Great atmosphere and outdoor patio. They also have daily food and drink specials, like taco Tuesday, and great service. Had the shrimp quesadilla and a margarita. Also love their chips and queso."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we were really excited to try this place out.   The menu looked pretty tasty, and I got us a free queso for checking in. The queso was decent, nothing I would pay for so I am glad it was free.   For dinner we had nachos, fajitas, and 2 tacos. The meat was tender but everything was kind of lack luster on the flavor. The service was not the greatest, our waitress was a little slower than we normally like, and it was not busy.   Maybe we will be back, and if so hopefully it has more pizzazz next time."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We had to wait half an hour to get our checks on a day where the restaurant was nearly empty. One of the chairs was broken and I injured my finger sitting down. We were not informed of surcharges on menu items until the check had already arrived."}
{"text":"My family loves coming here about once a month! Quick, yummy, and they are very friendly!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday $2 beef/Chicken & Chorizo. $2 Mexican draft beer & $3 local drafts! Can't beat it! Love the corn tortillas! Great flavor. Sat at the bar - chips and Salsa to start. Great service, clean & fresh food! Will be back. Oh and they have a special everyday of the week! So something for everyone. Next time going to try the homemade margaritas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently got back from Southern California, where we had authentic Mexican food every day. Since returning to NC, we haven't found anything that even compares. That is, until we found Three Amigos!   We brought our dog and sat on the patio this afternoon, around 2. It seemed to be a \"lull\" time for the restaurant, which was good since we had the pup. Patio was very nice and shady, and we had multiple servers stop and talk to us to help out (and meet the dog, of course). It was \"Mojito Wednesday\" so I got one of the Mojito Cubanos (no added flavor, I wanted to try it plain) and it was absolutely delicious! Although I wish the mint wasn't muddled in, as there were mint pieces all in the glass that got a little stuck in the straw. I prefer the mint to be smacked in the palm and then added straight to the glass. But either way, I could have had many more drinks if we had the time :)   We both tried a lunch special. I got the 1 taco/1 enchilada platter with their house mole sauce. The waitress told me she was impressed that I ordered it, as most people are afraid of the name and won't try it. Well for those of you who are scared off by it, DONT BE! It's a sweet brown sauce (it has chocolate in it...how can you hate it??) with a tiny kick of spice. I could've gone for more spice, personally, but I would definitely order it again! The rice and beans were flavorful and the portions were large. Additionally, the chicken was VERY tender and juicy! 5 stars for the chicken alone! My corn tortilla taco had only chicken, onions and cilantro, and I didn't even need the cheese or sour cream that I had originally intended on adding. So juicy and delicious!  We will be back to Three Amigos!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and decide to give it a try! We simply loved! The service, the people around, the menu, the food!!! We will come back!! Did I say that the food is incredible???"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The food is A+ and the service is phenomenal! We're always greeted with a smile, seated quickly, and the food is served in a jiffy. In addition, they've got some awesome drink specials throughout the week. If you're searching for a new Friday night spot, look no further! Three Amigos will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Three Amigos is in the process of changing their name - same management, different name. This was our first time visiting and will return no matter what the name. The food was good and plentiful. My wife got the chicken burrito and a hard taco and I got a beef enchilada  and a tostada. The burrito was especially good and more than she could eat. Both dishes came with Spanish rice and retried beans. I like spicy foods and they have a house-made verde sauce that lit my fires - not so hot that you can't taste your food but you know it's there long after you've finished each bite. I think about it fondly 3 days later."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try and unfortunately I was less impressed than the first time. The server wasn't very hospitable in my opinion and I felt rushed the entire time. We checked in to receive a free queso yet they still charged us for it and I didn't realize till after I left the restaurant. The queso came in a small size and was not worth the 4.95 that was spent."}
{"text":"Awesome food  the Carne asada is amazing and the guacamole is sooo damn good. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the dessert. We ordered the fried icecream they call the La Bamaba. Its NOT traditional fried ice cream. They take a ball of ice cream and fry it in a pastry shell. well the problem is by the time the pastry shell is cooked the ice cream is melted. So you get a shell with melted ice cream soup and plantains inside. I would skip the sparkler in it too and try to perfect the food. Otherwise this place is amazing. We will be back many many times"}
{"text":"I visit this place at least twice a month for take-out. The service is always excellent and the food is even better.  I highly recommend the chimichanga (I prefer ground beef, but the chicken is great too)."}
{"text":"Love this place and go there a few times a month. Chicken chimichanga is delicious and enough for two. Best salsa in town!!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Especially enjoyed the 5$ sangria and mojoitoe on Saturday special"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Typical Mexican place - which is a good thing. The place was absolutely packed at lunch in a weekday! Would come back."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area, so figured I would stop into the newest Three Amigos location, purely for comparison purposes. From the outside, it is much simpler to park - no worries about finding a space if there are more than ten people there. You just have to park a bit further away.  Once inside, the atmosphere is definitely newer and shinier than on Central, and it suffers a bit in comparison (but only in comparison - if you go to other Mexican places, it's fine). The staff is great, as always, and the bar area is a bit nicer than on Central. There are perhaps twice as many tables as there are on Central.  Most importantly, I am happy to report that the food seems identical to that on Central - the salsa verde, the mole, the tomatillo, everything tastes just as good in the new location. Hope that the crew can keep things going and expand even more in the future!"}
{"text":"Three Amigos is my book club's favorite place for our meetings, so I get to go here quite often.   Service is always very fast and courteous. Chips are always fresh. We love the guac and the queso dip here. For entree, I almost always get the shrimp tacos, which are my favorite. My husband loves the enchiladas rojas. The beans on the side are always delicious and don't taste like canned beans that seem to be common in most Mexican restaurants. I usually just skip over the beans, but at Three Amigos I do eat them (aren't you proud of me, Mom?). Mario (Jr) makes wonderful drinks. They do have large house margaritas for $5 on Fridays, which is a great drink, but I usually just ask Mario to whip up his best and go with whatever margarita he serves me... Which never fails to impress. The restaurant itself is nice and cozy, with indoor and outdoor seating, and ample parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. We've lived in Highland Creek for over 2 years and we eat here about 2-3 times a month. I love the fish tacos and my husband's favorite is the shredded beef enchilada. They remember us like we are family. Keep up the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Tried Three Amigos for the first time with my girlfriend- the food was solid and the service was excellent! I ordered the enchiladas mixtas, and all four enchiladas were very good. The mole poblano is awesome as many have said, but they were all pretty tasty. I almost wish I hadn't ordered the mixed enchiladas though because it was hard to get a true taste of each with only ~4 bites per enchilada. It came with a side of extra steak which was excellent (I ordered 2 steak enchiladas and 2 chicken) and a salad. I wish refried beans and rice would have come with it as well, but next time I can order those separate. My girlfriend got the chicken fajitas which were good but not great and didn't have much chicken. It was a HUGE portion though and came with both rice and beans, which was nice because I got to steal some of hers :) The service was excellent! The owner talked to us twice to make sure we were happy, our server consistently refilled our drinks, and she even gave us more salsa and brought out two spicier salsas on the house (which I highly recommend) after she saw how much we loved their normal salsa. The food was above average Mexican, and the service will definitely bring me back to try more options."}
{"text":"Paola. Very sweet gal and all of them were.  I had tostada and hard shell taco and rice.  Very good.   The salsa and chips were excellent.  Not the same ole salsa as other mexican restaurant s. This place had its own flare to it.  Drinks were great"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant.  The salsa is fresh and delicious.  The queso was yummy.  We had cheese enchiladas, tacos and a chimichanga.  All were delicious.  Service was great and prices reasonable.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The food and prices are really good. The salsa is really good and I recommend the tacos al pastor or pollo asada. They have a decent beer selection. The wait service is good, but the host seating has been a little slow the couple times we've been, but that's really the only negative I have."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all.. My girlfriend had what they call carne asada, and the meat tasted like it had a generic off the self fajita rub I only know that because I have that spice rub in my spice cabinet..  The meat should of been marinated in orange, lime and lemon juice with some spices... the salsa has no flavor at all.. i had the chilaquiles ( which is not on the menu) and it was drenched in off the shelf tomatillo sauce.. save your money and go somewhere else. You are better off going to taco bell."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food has definitely got real Mexican style flavor. They make there own hot sauce. Real good and got a nice kick at the end. Very friendly staff. Very clean and modern. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Chicken quesadilla was shredded and loaded with so much queso that it was soggy. Surprised because they have such a good rep but Im going to stick with Cabo Fish Taco."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious but thats only if you actually get it. The service is awful. We came here twice and there was only one waiter trying to serve the whole restaurant.  We saw customers come and leave. I felt bad for the poor guy."}
{"text":"Epanada was amazing! I had enough food from my entree' to feed a family of at least 3. I will definitely be back. The 3 stars is because my entree', Arroz Con Camoron needed more flavor."}
{"text":"Waited over 5 minutes for someone to even notice us. Then was told that they didn't know if they could seat us which was only three people total me my wife and daughter. At that point I noticed only one table with there food and everyone else looking upset. The girl told me to hold on she needed to ask her manager while I'm looking at 4 open tables she left and so did I will not be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"This has become one of my wife's and I favorite Mexican spot in the area. Food is always good and service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I've been looking for good Mexican food since moving to Charlotte and this place definitely lived up to the recommendations  I received. The $5 mojitos on Wednesday and $5 margaritas on Friday can't be beat. Mario Jr. and Danny are awesome!!! This place is definitely worth the drive if you live in North Charlotte."}
{"text":"Happy that I did alot of searching and found this place in the north. Terrific from the start... Frank helped us out with a Dos Equis draft and Margarita, chips and salsa were outstanding also. Frank gave us this creamy jalape√±o dip with free Yelp queso , awesome. Entrees were large and extremely tasty. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"DELISH! My husband and I love going here for our date nights. We both love Mexican food and there premium margaritas (which come in a fishbowl size glass) are great! I always get the Enchiladas Verdes, yum the food is fresh, the salsa's are fresh great authentic flavors."}
{"text":"Server was very nice. Food was good. Guacamole was excellent. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Three Amigos means 3 friends if you don't habla espanol.  The food is delicious and the service is fine.  Try the Enchiladas Verde.  The salsa is the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a Taco Tuesday date night here and it was EXCELLENT!! Aaron was our waiter and he was very gracious and accommodating. We were seated immediately and the atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming. After checking in on Yelp, I received a free queso dip so we were able to try it! I'd never had queso dip before but it was actually quite tasty! The complimentary salsa and chips is also pretty yummy as well! The last time I came in, I ordered the chicken taco on the corn tortilla. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't anything to rave about. This time, I ordered the shrimp taco on the flour tortilla and it was AMAZING!! I ordered 3, thinking I wouldn't be able to eat them all, but I demolished them, smh! The shrimp is chopped which is different from other shrimp tacos I've tried and it helped to ensure each bite contained shrimp. My husband ordered 2 ground beef tacos and 2 chorizo tacos. He was convinced that he only ordered 2 ground beef and 1 chorizo but clearly it didn't matter because he inhaled all 4 of them, lol! I would recommend this restaurant because the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is inviting and the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great Service.  Yelp Deals are the best!!!  Glad to have a local Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband wasn't a fan of the chorizo but it didn't stop him from eating his tostada. Next time he'll probably just do beef.   The guac was fresh and really great. My toddler (and we) loved the rice and beans and I loved my street tacos. I ordered al pastor and carne asada and just asked for some sour cream to complete my meal. The waitress was kind and totally okay with any little additions or changes we wanted. The only thing was that my husband had to ask for his refill both times and it was not busy. It's not the best Mexican food I've ever had but it was VERY good and most importantly tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"This was good Mexican food (Californian good). We will be back. The margaritas were awesome. I had mixed fajitas and they were fabulous. I recommend the churros for dessert too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Mexican restaurant by far. 2 dollar taco Tuesdays and 2 dollar Mexican beers. Their fish tacos are top notch. Bottomless FRESH and warm chips and salsa, and definitely give their enchiladas a try. Everything is FRESH. Fridays have 5 dollar margaritas, and the staff is great. They have black beans as an alternative for refried and they are more flavorful than most. Definitely try out this spot. If you haven't yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. We go so often that we don't even need to look at the menu. I was a little nervous when we went tonight and I saw hints that the management/owners had changed (new menu, food presented differently, etc.) but the food was still awesome and the same great quality as usual. Fajitas, burritos, chimichangas, empanadas (ground beef is the best filling for the empanadas)... all of it is very tasty. The chips and salsa are good and well flavored. Our server tonight was very friendly (as every server we've had there has been) and brought us extra salsas to try, which was nice.   The only thing that is just okay to me is the margarita. I've tried them on two different occasions and find them to have too much mixer in them so it's super sour.   Overall - we love this place and I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Too slow!  Wednesday evening was very slow.  Sat for 10 minute wait before the waiter came by.  Good food though.  Huntersville location.  New owner."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! We loved this place. It was poppin on a Friday! $5 house margaritas! The food was spectacular. I ordered the Rojas enchiladas, and wasn't a fan of the sauce... so the manager Chakal went above and BEYOND to make my experience better. He brought out 3 different Salsas to accompany my enchiladas until finally he just made some of his own for me! My own special sauce! Service was spectacular. The owner was so sweet and lively! This place really made me feel at home. I will definitely be back ASAP! Thanks again to the owner and manager, you guys rock."}
{"text":"The queso was awful and overpriced. Our server took way too long to check up on us. We spent more time waiting for the check than actually eating. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will be back. Margaritas were excellent, food great, and fast, friendly service! Overall extremely happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. The hostess was wonderful, he was so kind and joyful. Our server was lovely and very nice. The food was delicious and high quality for a great price. Their mojitos are $5 on Saturdays and they're SO GOOD. Everything tasted fresh- the salsa was flavorful and the chips were the best I've had around here. I like how the restaurant is intimate and good for families. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great the prices are just right and the staff is amazing.they are all so friendly and always willing to go the extra mile. I am never disappointed when I come."}
{"text":"Authentic. Homemade. Fresh. Amazing! In my opinion this is one of the best chains for good Mexican food in Charlotte!  The Margaritas are made with fresh lime and not from a concentrated powder - 100% from scratch - the guy that makes them comes in every two days and squeezes the limes by hand.  Also on Fridays is $5 Large house Margaritas! U won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. The server was nice but I had an empty water during the whole meal and she never filled it. You can see the owner and his wife sitting at the bar absolutely doing nothing. The food was okay it was very bland and didn't have any taste to it. It was almost like eating baby food. I went to the bathroom and the floor the bathroom is crunchier than the tortilla chips you get. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants and this place is by far my favorite place now!  The wait staff is so friendly and nice and on top of their game!  The food is so fresh, and I love how it seems so authentic and not \"Americanized\".  You can taste the freshness in the food.  I love their chicken tacos, they make something so simple taste so amazing.  Their house made sangria is killer as well, and I love how they put fresh fruit in there.  Hit up taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed. The service was great, chips and salsa were crazy good, tacos de asada were on point. Not an all the way authentic Mex place but very very good. I'm hard to please so this says a lot."}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing!! Best authentic Mexican food in Charlotte. My colleges and I love to travel here for group lunches or to treat external stakeholders to some delicious food. The 3-A's Nachos, Enchiladas Verdes and Fajitas de Camar√≥n  are my favorite. This place is close to home which is a huge plus too!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Mexican restaurant, and I'm luck it's so close. It's a \"nice\" Mexican restaurant not a cheap one. The staff is friendly and they have daily specials - Friday is margarita day. Personally, I think the queso is fantastic! It's the main reason I come, but the menu has a lot of different options. There is also a great patio for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I love this MEXICAN restaurant! I have not been disappointed yet. If I could afford to eat here everyday, I would! The rice and beans...OMG! I love it. The employees are wonderful and attentive. My favorite Mexican restaurant so far!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic Mexican and their tomatillo verde sauce is amazing! I could eat there every day!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place a million tums and finally decided to check it it Friday.  To be honest, I'd been interested for a whole, but the whole \"check in and get a free cheese dip\" thing convinced me to go here and not another restaurant nearby.    Their staff was so pleasant and, even though we had to wait about 15 min for a table, the host offered us water, kept checking on us and updating us on the status of our wait. Was really great.  Waiter was great, margarita was so good. Fish tacos were just okay, but the ambience and customer service will def have me try it again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood feel, patio space and friendly staff but I  do wonder if septum piercing in part if the uniform . We usually go for the Taco Tuesday but I like to try something different each visit. My favorites are veggies tacos, anything with mole and fajitas with lettuce wraps when I am watching carbs. Least favorite fish soup it was too fishy."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Im from California and its been really hard finding a mexican spot thats authentic. Wasnt a big of the refried beans or the carne tacos. But it did the job. The mojito drink was good but I probably wont be back. Just not the taste I was looking for."}
{"text":"I dine here almost weekly. Mostly because it's close to home but also because they serve great food. I've had so many things from the menu.  Fish tacos (grilled or fried) are my usual, fried being my preferred style.  The tacos de cabeza (shredded beef) are Amazing!  Served traditional with chopped onions and cilantro.  Burritos and chimichangas are delicious. The shrimp cocktail is huge and very tasty. Great as a meal on warm summer days.  Nachos app is huge and one of my favorite things.  Daily specials are good. $5 Margaritas on Friday are huge and delicious. They have a selection of local beers and their bar area is nice. If you like spicy salsas ask for their green and orange sauces. They're soooo good on everything.  For dessert (if you have space and you might not) churros and fried ice cream are both great and big enough to share.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this cute little mexican place! A friend and I went to try and grab some great food quickly, and it worked out perfectly! We feasted on chips and queso, guac, and veggie fajitas! I really loved how fresh the ingredients were- and our lovely waitress was accommodating and great! We had more than enough food for two people and all at a relatively reasonable price! The lunch menu looks great as well- but we missed it by going on a sunday! Keep in mind you get free queso if you check in with Yelp! Thank you Yelp for always coming through!"}
{"text":"Was surprised to see we had a new restaurant at that location. So gave it a try last night for dinner.  Wow,    A+ on the food, A+ on the service.  Outstanding restaurant and my new favorite.  Fresh ingredients and it shows. Was glad to see they had a nice sized crowd there cause I really really hope this place makes it. One thing, maybe turn down the volume on the music a bit.  But still a great place  Update 11/9/2013  Been coming here 2,3,4 times a month since my first visit. My wife and I ate dinner there tonight. ALWAYS excellent food and good service.  Still love this place and a great alternative to the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"It took me almost two years to find good Mexican food. A coworker had been telling us about this place for months. Actually the one on central but this one is just much closer for us.  Our first visit was impromptu and definitely worth it. We had ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. It took a while for it come out but once it came out, I understood why. They definitely made it fresh and it had big colossal size shrimp. The shrimp were even a little warm still. The base of the cocktail was a little sweeter than I'm used to but still delicious. Get this, you won't be disappointed. My main meal was the jalisciences which is an enchilada with a steak on top. Omg, I can't tell you how happy I was eating this. Seasoned and cooked perfectly. It had these pan fried potatoes that I couldn't stop eating. I wanted more. My steak was cooked medium, tender and full of flavor.   On our most recent visit we did the nachos for our appetizer and these were good too. Topped with shredded chicken, lettuce, crema and Fresca queso. I didn't finish it because I'm not a fan of refried beans on my nachos but still pretty good.   I also ordered the seafood soup and I had to wait for a bit for this to come out. Our server did not initially tell us it would take a little longer for this meal but since we were grubbing on nachos I didn't mind. They did eventually let me know and asked if I wanted them to bring my son's food out now or wait. So that was nice and considerate of them. But upon arrival of my food, I could smell the aroma and it was delightful. The first spoon of broth made my mouth sing a joyous harmony. It is that good. It had tilapia, clams, mussels, octopus, shrimp and squid. The only thing I was missing was a side of corn tortillas but I asked for some and they brought some out quickly.   So overall, I've been extremely happy every time we dine here. The servers are always professional, polite and take good care of you without being overbearing.   The food is made with love ya'll. Hands down the best Mexican food in Charlotte. It's always fresh and some of the most flavorful food I have had."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Husband got the Steak Enchiladas Mixtas and the meat was soooo favorable. I really enjoyed the cheese dip as well. It was pretty small so I don't know that I would have paid $5 for it aside from the check in special. I had the shrimp quesadilla and it was good but a little plain for my tastes. I wish they offered more of a Shrimp Fajita Quesadilla with peppers as well. I really appreciate the fresh squeezed drinks but the margarita just tasted really sweet. I wish it was poured heavier. We opted for the Corona special rather than buying more margaritas. All in all good food and service."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and we were very happy with the atmosphere,service and the food. We arrived bout 5:30pm on a friday  and we left by 7pm when it got really busy. I found their Margarita drink alittle weak but we will return a diffrent night to try it again. Nice place for friends to enjoy.We will ask to sit out in their patio next time. ;)"}
