{"text":"In an earlier review of another dim sum restaurant in the Spadina, I said \"where can you find $2.00 a dish dim sum anymore\"?  Well it appears we have discovered another one! And this time - it's better than the other restaurant I reviewed before!  Quality and quantity is better here. Fried shrimp dumplings - at the other place you get 3 small ones. Here? 4 large ones. Ha gow? Better here. There's also more selection it seems.   It's less busy as the other place, but we also arrived a bit later than our normal dim sum time. The place marginally more decorative - with the seat covers and fancy table cloth, but both were stained with old sauces and food.   Will visit again. Hopefully the linens are cleaner."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. never going back.. foods decent..BUT they say 2.20 for all items (lunchtime) and some item we ordered which was same size as all other they counted as a SPECIALTY item and charged us 6$ for it and didnt tell us it was priced any differently.. when we inquired they said \"you'll know for next time\" .. sorry, there won't be a next time.. BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR BILL IF YOU GO... ASK THE PRICE OF EACH ITEM.. THEY ALSO ADD A CHARGE FOR THE TEA!!! 1$ per customer...."}
{"text":"The prices on the menu are very reasonable. However, the meat in the dumplings occasionally tastes rotten. Additionally, the woman at the counter (owner?) often doesn't use a calculator and she overcharged me by a few dollars on my bills many times. I believe she does this intentionally. Ensure that you know what the prices are and check the calculations on your bills carefully before you hand her your money."}
{"text":"After 18 months of searching, I've finally found a dim sum restaurant in the Chinatown/Spadina area that I am entirely happy with.  And that is Dim Sum King.  Access to the restaurant is not the most convenient.  It is on Dundas Street, a bit farther from Spadina, and even in the area it is a little hidden, on the third floor of a building.  It's worth looking it up, though.  Simply put, it has the best overall dim sum quality in the area.  First of all, this restaurant has the square footage to use the traditional dim sum carts, rather than written menus.  While the waiters are just as busy as in other places in the area, they seem to have been better trained or chosen -- they are more helpful and courteous than in most restaurants of this ilk.  Seating is plentiful, and this restaurant, to me, also doesn't have as much attitude about a single diner coming in.  The food is the main reason I keep coming back.  Dim Sum King has the best beef tendon (??) in Chinatown, spicy but not overwhelmingly so, with a large enough portion, and a secret ingredient -- the small cubes of taro (??) at the bottom of the dish.  They enhance the flavour of the tendon.  Shrimp dumplings (??) are firm and flavourful.  The shrimp rice-noodle wraps (???) are a little on the small side, but tasty enough.  The fried shrimp dumplings (??) are massive and the shrimp inside are still juicy rather than dried up.  They have both egg tarts (??) and milk (??) tarts -- I haven't tried the former, but the milk tarts are absolutely delightful.  The bean-curd wraps (???) are quite good.  Squid tentacles (???) are tangy and spicy, with the only down side being that they're not always completely hot.  They also serve freshly made pan-fried dumplings (??) and the rare milk pudding (???).  The variety of the dim sum here is impressive.  The pork dumplings (??) are one of the weak spots.  No place in the Spadina area seems to get it right, and Dim Sum King does not distinguish itself here.  The dumpings are too hard and dense.  Palatable, but not worthy of praise.  There is only one down side to Dim Sum King, and that is that many of its dishes are put under the \"Large\" or \"Special\" category (some of them, in my opinion, shouldn't be), which means if you like ordering those dishes, your expenditure will be a little higher than in some other places in the area.  The quality and overall dining experience, however, are still worth it."}
{"text":"Fucking most horrible experience at a dim sum place, and the good reviews seem to be outdated as whatever was good about this place no longer exists. They took very very long to serve us and when they did, the food was shit and they kept bringing us things that we already received constantly making mistakes over and over and forgot to bring half our order without us having to remind them. For example I asked for something as simple as cold fucking water 3 times to two different waiters and not once did it come, I was thirsty and losing my patience but what happened next tops it off as I will never fucking come back to this crap hole ever again. I was willing to let the horrible service, mediocre borderline shitty cold food go but she it came time to pay the bill the waiter brought a debit terminal over, grabbed my debit card from me and as usual would enter in the total for our table, but NO........ NO, he took my card tapped it which was odd to me and I asked for the receipt to find out he went ahead, and TIPPED HIMSELF WITHOUT EVEN PASSING ME THE FUCKING TERMINAL. HE EVEN TIPPED HIMSELF 15 FUCKING PERRCENT TIP, INSTEAD OF THE REGULAR 10 PERCENT. I HONESTLY WAS GOING TO TIP THEM 10 PERCENT ANYWAY DESPITE THEIR SHITTY SERVICE BECAUSE I AM NICE BUT NO, THEY WENT AHEAD AND DID IT FOR ME. DO NOT COME HERE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES AND IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE HUNGRY BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOMPETENT SERVICE FOR 25 DOLLARS PLUS FORCED TIP BE MY GUEST.   Dim sum king..... more like dim sum thieves. Lololololol"}
{"text":"Our group meets every month for dim sum. We love this place. The service is fast and attentive. The food is consistently top notch - there are interesting food combos and it is always fresh. You order off carts here, though. So if you don't know your dim sum or are not willing to try what you don't know, you may have challenges. The cart ladies do try to help a bit, but really you are on your own.   While you are at the mercy of whatever is coming by, if you ask for some specific dish usually they can a) send the right cart lady over, or b) tell you when it is scheduled to come out.   You can be in and out in an hour. Our gang paid $13/person all in!  Visited: Feb. 15, 2015; March 15, 2015"}
{"text":"Discovered this place recently, it's now my goto weekend dimsum place downtown.  This restaurant is authentic with their carts being pushed around, the way it should be.  Some of them can be aggressive and forgetful on what you have already ordered and continue to ask if you want the same thing that you're still trying to finish.   The portions are generous, tasty in an authentic way and priced appropriately."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this was my first dim sum experience.  Based on my expectations and research, this was the real deal! We arrived 40 minutes before closing so the restaurant was not busy. Just a few tables were in use.  After showing the waiter our choices and telling him we were dim sum virgins, he added one more dish to our choices and proceeded with the meal.    The BBQ pork bun was amazing...tender, steaming and delicious!  The steamed special dumplings with peanuts and the shrimp/chive fried dumplings were both notable as well. I have never had anything like the soft egg custard and it had mixed reviews at the table.  I thought it was unique and the subtle sweetness was excellent.  The Mango pudding was to die for and the short ribs were also good.  Chicken noodle soup was a must have for my kids and we all ended up dipping our chopsticks in to the bowl! Overall, the staff was very patient with us, both for arriving not long before closing and for asking questions about the food.  I would definitely go back to try more dim sum and other dishes from the other menu."}
{"text":"Two separate issues for me.  I had made reservations a week ago for 30 people to celebrate a special occasion for a friend. I assumed all the tables would be grouped together but this wasn't the case. The third table was separated by another occupied table. Not ideal for celebrating this occasion. I brought this issue up with the manager but he just shrugged it off. Not the most customer oriented response especially with the knowledge they had about the numbers a week in advance. 1 star for that issue.  The dim sum was passable but I have to say the egg custard tart was really good. 4stars"}
{"text":"I'm gong to have to update my original favorable review.  I've been a few times since and each new time the quality of the food gets worse and worse.  The last time will probably be the final time since virtually every dish was served at room temperature or even cold.  We had to send back several dishes picked up from the carts so that they could be re-heated in the kitchen.  At least they had the good sense to actually replace the dishes with freshly cooked hot ones rather than just microwave them as we'd requested, but they should have been hot in the first place.  The only dishes that came to the table hot where the pan fried turnip cakes and shrimp cakes from the cooking station at the front of the restaurant and they were both delicious.  One more thing to their credit is that in any dish that contained shrimp it was fresh, and fairly sweet.  Wherever they are getting it from should be the mandatory sea food supplier to every restaurant in Chinatown.  Anyway, with some new options now opening in Chinatown I will start trying a few different places before going back."}
{"text":"Most of the shrimp dishes tasted fresh. A lot of the fried dishes came out greasy and cold. The service took a lot longer for how few people were there."}
{"text":"i'll admit that it's usually not a terrible experience. however, tonight was dreadful. if i could give zero stars i would."}
{"text":"AVOID - Service is beyond bad here. Food is mediocre. Reservation system is a complete joke. Just save yourselves the trouble and go somewhere else. Anywhere else will most likely be better."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to dim sum place downtown for Sunday lunch. They have a good variety of dishes, reasonable prices, and decent enough quality. We've tried a lot of places in the core, trying to find the best dim sum. While it certainly cannot compare to Markham, Scarborough, or Hong Kong dim sum, Dim Sum King has the most selection that accommodates the tastes of everyone in my family, and isn't overly expensive (like Pearl Harbourfront or Crown Princess). Two dishes that could use some work/consistency are the tripe and BBQ buns."}
{"text":"The address is Dundas but the locator places it on college at near yonge"}
{"text":"First time eating here was satisfying. The various dumplings were good quality and you can see they were freshly prepared. Other food lacked flavor and I had to ask for extra sauce.  If you go during their happy hour, it's a decent deal."}
{"text":"Went there on the weekend for dinner with a group of friends.  We ordered a lot of dim sum, beer, etc.  For dim sum, everything was ok.  Nothing stood out as being great or bad, pretty middle of the road stuff.  Actually, the General Tso chicken was below average, like they just deep fried some chicken and added sweet and sour sauce.    However, I would like to compliment the service.  The head waiter/floor manager(?) was tentative, took care of us and genuinely funny.  Even the others who actually did the serving, dishes removal, etc were very good and compliments to them all.  Unfortunately with high volume restaurants, quantity and not quality is the usual so it was a pleasant surprise.    If the food was better, it'd be 4 stars but definitely 3.5."}
{"text":"I've been on the prowl for a consistently good all day dim sum place in the Spadina/Dundas neighbourhood.  The two of us arrived at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday.  A group of three was following us in.  But for one table (a couple with one child) getting ready to leave, the dining room was a sea of empty tables and chairs.  Still, there had to be a discussion between the waiter and a woman from the back as to where to seat us!    We were finally seated at a table (round, jammed against the wall, awkward) and the other people were seated at a table directly behind us.  The waiter placed dinner menus on the table and walked off.  I know it was too late in the day for carts, but call me weird for thinking if you are going to call yourself \"Dim Sum King\" and advertise that you have all day dim sum, a dim sum menu should at least be offered.    After awhile, the waiter came back and I asked for the dim sum sheet.  So did the other table.  After another while, the waiter came back with the dim sum sheets.  After yet another while,, the waiter came back and looked at our selections.   He started stroking out things, saying they have run out of this and that, that the chef had gone home, and that anything we order from the dim sum menu will be reheated leftovers from lunch.  He did not offer to tell us what could be substituted for the unavailable items.  Not thrilling news, but we had already been there for a half hour and were starving.  After yet another while, the waiter came and asked us to move from our table.  They wanted to set up a table for six against the window five feet behind us!  So we moved.  After yet another while, food came.  Only it wasn't our food.  It was the other table's food.  I knew it right away and I told the woman who was setting it out that.  Soooo...she did not believe me.  What???    I pointed out that the carbon copy of our dim sum sheet did not show what she was putting down.  She was stunned and confused and just stood there.  I suggested gently that she may have gotten the (OMG two) tables mixed up.  She consulted with our waiter and, as I suspected, the food was for the other table.    One can only imagine the chaos that would ensue if there were more than five diners at once.  After yet another while, our food came.  Well, he certainly meant what he said when he said they will reheat leftovers from lunch.  Warm, not hot and definitely looking sad.  So we had:  Har Gow:  very good outside...just the right, chewy, sticky texture to it.  Unfortunately, they chopped up the shrimp so much that when you took a bite, the rest of the filling falls out in big crumbles.  Sui Mai:  small, very solid.  Kind of grey from the reheating.  The orangey \"eggs\" sprinkled on top were shriveled up so much that they felt like grit on your tongue.  Beef Short Ribs:  excellent.  Not fatty, good amount of pepper, a touch of sweetness.  Steamed Spareribs with Black Bean Sauce:  excellent flavour.  Very fatty, but we were, as I said, starving.  Shrimp Cheung Fun:  overcooked to the point of mush.  From the bill, it seems that they charge $3.25 for the small items and $3.50 for the medium items.  We didn't get a chance to have any large items.  Maybe they had an off day.  I don't know.  I probably will try it again to be fair...but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is not the only place I go for dim sum. Very much enjoy the delicious and reasonably priced food at Dim Dum King,  it's this special experience prompted me to write a review. I was close to Chinatown area and hoping to satisfy my dim sum craving on a Monday night. I called in around 9:55 and even though they are closing, they still took my order. The manager was very patience and offered me bottled water while I wait.   I've been to dim sum places where they charge for tea, increase price during night times, and etc.. Some of those offer great food and service too, but it's the warm vibe and traditional cart styled dim sum that draws me to Dim Sum King. They don't just run it as a business but take pride of serving it to people."}
{"text":"This was our second destination of the day for lunch. We arrived at 130pm. The place appeared somewhat deserted.  I believe we missed the lunch rush.  The food was plentiful...carts with food kept coming by our table as it was located close to the kitchen at the back.  The place looked as though it was getting ready for a wedding banquet.  We ordered the requisite chinese steamed chicken feet, egg tarts, mango pudding, curry baby squid, deep fried taro balls, and deep fried sweet chewy pork filled balls. Yes, that is not your traditional xiu mai and ha gao, but we had filled our stomachs previously at Asian Legends.  Overall the service was good, the prices was reasonable ($10 per person). It's not the best dim sum i've ever had but its acceptable for downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout dim sum from here for dinner yesterday, and it was delicious.   We got:  1) Har gow (shrimp dumplings)  2) Siu mai  3) Chicken feet  4) Steamed spare ribs  5) Char siu bao (BBQ pork buns)  6) Fried vermicelli SIngapore style  7) Stir fried mixed vegetables  & we got a bonus dish: deep fried taro with meat and deep fried meat and shrimp dumpling.   We loved almost every dish!  My favourite was the chicken feet and the siu mai, both were really flavourful and fresh and great portions. The stir fried mix veg was surprisingly free of oil and soy sauce, and looked almost steamed. It was so healthy and exactly what I was looking to balance out the other carb heavy stuff.  The bonus dish of deep fried items was soggy and not crispy as I would expect from deep fried take out, but it was free and a bonus item so who cares, it was a nice surprise that it was even added at all.    Will definitely come back here for dim sum again :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday with my son, the place was very busy, but we managed a table in less than 10 minutes. The food was great, fresh, tasty, but the for some reason the choices were few. We chose siu mai, pork and black beans, shrimp fried dumpling, cuddlefish, and had a plate of the pea pods, delish. Was waiting for har gao, and maybe shrimp rolls, but couldn't find any until we were leaving. Still, a good experience."}
{"text":"Been twice and it was good both time. A little ghetto though because one of the cooks was wearing a garbage bag as an apron. No joke."}
{"text":"We just went there and we have to say we hated it. The meat was undercooked. The pork was pinkish red. We asked for it to be changed. It was the same result. Everything was greasy. No flavour in any of the dishes we had. We are not fussy eaters and are adventurous eaters. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed and to give some background I was born and raised in Vancouver so I know my dim sum. It just seems there is no proper benchmark for dim sum in Toronto's Chinatown.  This place came onto my radar with recent blog and Yelp posts and I was excited to hear that there may be once again a decent dim sum place in Chinatown. The moment we walked in and sat down it was just disappointing, the table clothes at our table were stained, the tea cups and plates were sticky, and the same carts of dim sum made its' rounds for almost the entire time we were there. Not much in terms variety and the quality of dim sum really lacks. For example, we ordered the big dumpling that comes in a soup. Usually it has some shrimp, fake shark fin, and some meat in this giant dumpling within a really tasty broth. But all that was in there was a dumpling skin holding a couple of measly shrimps and not much else and it was in this really yellowy broth that didn't look natural. The usual dim sum dishes like har gow and shu mai were ok but nothing spectacular. I will not be back and not sure what the rage was with all the other posts I've seen on this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can not believe what I found in my curry octopus. I am absolutely DISGUSTED! And will NEVER RETURN! I told the server and all he did was say \"Oh...\" and then he took it away. He came back apologized and told me he would take it off my bill. I can't believe they had the audacity to make me pay the bill after such a disgustingly dirty meal. I could get sick and food poisoning from this! You have been warned! STAY AWAY! Unless you want to eat bugs/maggots/larvae etc"}
{"text":"Came on on Tuesday (non holiday weekday) around lunch time for lunch. Surprisingly, the place was packed, although with middle aged to elderly Cantonese speaking patrons. We had no trouble in getting a table for 2 at this time. I speak Cantonese fluently but found that the cart pushers thought I spoke English only. About half of the pushers ignored anyone they thought did not speak Cantonese. I watched a non-profit Chinese couple order 1 item but then leave soon after because they could not get food to eat. We waited 45 minutes for chicken feet but none came out. Many times, we had to walk up to the very top get what we wanted because the cart was empty by the time it reached us. This place is good if you look and speak Chinese. I would say visit at your own risk if you don't look Chinese."}
{"text":"I did not go here for dim sum. Instead my family went here for dinner because some of my relatives had come here for both lunch and dinner before.  The place certainly looked nice. It looked like it was ready for a wedding or a very special occasion. My family was the first table to be filled. We were actually the only ones there for a while. It felt sort of strange just because this restaurant was so big (it took up an entire upper floor).  The service was very odd, but looking back it was sort of funny. The staff, including the kitchen staff were playing mah jong in the corner of the restaurant since there were no customers coming. Even when we got there, they didn't do anything. We were seated and given a menu to look at, but that was about it. My family felt like the staff were more into their mah jong game than actually doing their jobs. We had a hard time getting someone's attention to take our order.The service kind of improved when 2-3 more tables were filled. (Still, it was strange that a place so large had almost no customers.)  Foodwise, it was just okay. The seafood we got tasted dry and getting the shells off was a task. There was also a hair in our lobster dish. Nothing else we ordered really stood out. I don't think I ate much for dinner that night.  I'll just assume that their dim sum is better than their dinner stuff since the place is called \"Dim Sum KING\". I for sure would never come back here for dinner and I don't know if I'd give lunch a shot. If I ever do, it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great variety as carts are pushed around.  No guessing from pictures, just point and served.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The dim sum here was amazing.  We have eaten dim sum everywhere and we have to say that this restaurant is one of the best.  The dishes were well seasoned and not salty.  We also ordered chinese broccoli.  We thought it was going to be steamed with some hoisin sauce like most places, but it was sauted in garlic.  It was so good."}
{"text":"Review is for dinner... which was served family style.....  Service was efficient.... All dishes were decent,  from the soup,  vegetable,  crabclaw dish, whole fish, shrimp, etc......One guest in our party order a orange beef, which surprisedly I don't know what it was....   There was no hint of orange flavor or orange peel in it whatso ever..... Maybe they don't know how to make or ordered something else...   Otherwise,  meal was decent."}
{"text":"My go-to dim sum place in Chinatown if I want cart service for yum cha.  The restaurant is spacious for being in the downtown location and one of the more modern and cleanest restaurant in the area.  I was here last week for Chinese new year dim sum with my best friend and came around noonish so it was fairly busy.   We were a little disappointed since the carts weren't frequent and it seemed like the same carts were being circulated.  I had gone for a run earlier that morning so was very hungry, but was very patient because that's what dim sum with cart service is about.   Ordering one or two dishes at a time as the carts circulated is they key to dim sum so food remains fresh and hot; plus it helps with digestion - eating slowly, enjoying the food, drinking tea, and catching up with conversation as that's what dim sum is about.  Credit goes to the ladies with the carts as they tried to sell off their food even though we already had their dishes. Bonus about speaking Cantonese, they were extremely friendly to us and did suggest if we wanted something in particular we could order from the servers wearing vests. We weren't in any hurry and didn't know exactly what we wanted so just waited for the carts to circulate.   Dim sum for two came to close to $38 which is a little pricey for the amount of food we had - 7 standard dim sum dishes. Plus I did not like fact that the server waited while we paid,  but realized we were taking our time, so eventually left.  There was no lineup and by this time it wasn't busy, so not sure why they were trying to rush us out.  With a name like Dim Sum King you would expect exceptional dim sum, but that's not the case.  Overall, good experience and good decent dim sum for downtown location in Chinatown. Definitely worth a visit if you want traditional cart service."}
{"text":"This place has never ever disappointed me. Every time we have visitors from out of town, it's dimsum time! The place is clean, the staff are nice, the atmosphere is great, and the food is consistently delicious. When my friends and I eat here, we usually spend $15 each and we leave stuffed. Highly recommended dimsum experience!  And make sure you check out the wall of fame in the lobby. Lots of important folks have eaten here. And honestly, I found out about this place from Olivia Chow's autobiography, so thank you Olivia!"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations, but I was not satisfied in the end.  Service- dim sum are all served with dim sum carts, you need to wait and wait until what you want come. Waitresses speak cantonese, so if you can't understand Cantonese like me, I did not get all dim sum I want before I walked out from this restaurant.  Dim sum- just average, since everything finally come to your table has already been put on those carts for a long time, I think they are not hot enough."}
{"text":"I managed to come down here during the week when all dishes are $2 each.  I had har gow, siu mia, cheun fun and sticky rice.  Ample size and filling.  The only downside is you don't know how long the ladies have been pushing the cart around as you may get a dish that's cold.  The tea isn't free here like at other Chinese restaurants I have been to in the area."}
{"text":"This is just the worst chinese food in north america. The lobster and the fish is not fresh. The shrimp tofu plain. Service was very bad. This is just the worst chinese food in north america."}
{"text":"Worst service.  They greeted us as if we were a bother. They proceeded to seat us and forget us. When we finally go their attention and they gave us a chance to order they neglected to bring most of what we ordered. We waited and waited and watched as almost the entire staff then took lunch and continued to ignore us. The food they did bring was mostly fatty and dripping in oil.  Have had dim sum in Philadelphia and Chicago chinatowns that was fast, fun, good value, delicious and satisfying. This was none of the above."}
{"text":"Coming from an asian family that often goes to chinese restuarants for dim sum, this place sucks. For example, we waited for an hour and didn't see a single cart of shrimp rice rolls go by our table. What kind of chinese restaurant doesn't serve shrimp rice rolls in an appropriate time range? Same went for the egg tarts. The service is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, helpful and DELICIOUS!!!! The busy time is the best time for this vigorous lunch experience. Their cart service makes dimsum here so outstanding and exciting. They welcome \"bring your own cake\" for special occasions like birthdays.  They helped me with candles and hiding a surprise cake for my husband in their fridge. Many thanks for the memorable bday luch!"}
{"text":"I miss Yiu Wah Restaurant but this replacement isn't too bad. The place was full, the food was fine and the cart ladies were very pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the mixed reviews for this place. First, this place is located on the third floor in the heart of Chinatown. As you probably know, Toronto has a huge Asian population unmatched by most cities in North America.  While I lack enough experience to be sure, this place felt as authentic as it could be.   You order off of a menu indicated how many of the steamed, deep fried, sweet, selections you wanted. They are sorted almost by T-shirt sizes like S, M, L, and XL and sized/priced accordingly.   Everything that came out was liked by one member of our party. Some were loved by all.   Service was fine, but they were not crowded on a late Thursday night. Very interested in pleasing the customer even if it takes a minute to get the full understanding due to language barrier.   The dishes described in English should be self explanatory and of great taste and quality. I really liked the bbq pork buns and the short ribs. All of the shrimp dishes were very good as well.   Prices and quantity of the food were very reasonable and we left happy, full, and satisfied.   I noticed the average was a ballpark 3, but elites were ranking 4/5's. The elites are right.  P.s. While the carpet and chairs are a little dated, the place was otherwise really clean, including the bathrooms!  (But fix the commercial dyson hand dryers,they are broken)"}
{"text":"Fair price and most items taste great. I would have said 4 stars if the restaurant didn't get so chaotic during peak times. Go early or expect to fight for scraps. No joke, the last time I was there patrons were running up to carts and pushing each other to get stuff. Crazy!"}
{"text":"Get ready for 300% recommended daily serving of sodium with just one sitting at this restaurant. My taste palate was exposed to nothing but salt. It's hard to understand that this busy restaurant has such high ratings with so-so food. Service is standard for restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're hungry.  Arrived at 10am on a Saturday and the only carts being pushed around were deep fried food.  Sat for half an hour, and only managed to order one thing.  The ladies who push the carts will go straight to the regulars and blow right by you as you try to wave them down.  I've been to many traditional dim sum places where they push carts and this stands out as the worst."}
{"text":"Favorite dim sum place in the city. Come in on the weekend for the cart service. Only way to do it. Incredibly fresh and hot items. Seasonal. Quick and efficient service. Been here so many times already, will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Everyone knows if you want dimsum, you go uptown. However, I'm a downtown(ish) girl living in an downtown world, so sometimes I have to make do with what is down here.   Pretty average. We came on a weekday during Christmas, and as such, missed the carts. Our card came already filled in so we had to scribble out the numbers to fill in what we wanted. Even so we got something we didn't order (but ate it anyways). They also came around with other dim sum items on plates in case we changed our mind and wanted something else in addition to what we ordered on the card.   Once finished, we sat for a while waiting for someone to take our card but then decided to just go to the cash ourselves since the parking was about to run out. Not sure if this is the norm or if they felt like ignoring us.   Still, the price was good and I did like the large room and cleanliness of the place. I'm definitely keen on trying again."}
{"text":"a) The food is greasy in general. b) The shrimp noodle rolls were good, but the sauce was watery/diluted and weak. c) The price is right; $2/dim sum. d) Nice service."}
{"text":"All day dim sum, on carts with good variety and very reasonably priced, fed 4 for C$32+  Inside is nice and big and spacious, with the push carts something of nostalgia - can't get these in many places now, so I love seeing them bring the delights of dim sum over and try and sell their wares :)  Glad I was recommended this place, take the lift to the 3rd floor where they are located, or there are stairs too."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for over 10 years! The staff greet my grandparents by name and are always very welcoming towards older generations and older, Chinese 'regulars'. However, I believe stronger efforts can be made in being more inviting and amiable to many of the young adults, university students, and working professionals that make up a decent portion of their guests.  Each time I go, I see a diverse crowd of patrons. For the most part, the servers are fairly open to showing and explaining the dishes to you if you aren't familiar, or if you're 'non-asian'.   Food-wise, this is probably one of the best places in downtown Toronto to eat dim sum. Every time I go, I can NEVER go without ordering their pork sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves, fried turnip cakes, and soft tofu in sugar water. These are to die for! Highly recommended!  Overall, this is a wonderful place to go with big families, a large group of friends, or just by yourself. The noise level is fairly high, but there is lots of space. I never feel overcrowded or packed. Their prices are very fair and reasonable."}
{"text":"In my limited dim sum experience, this place is pretty good! We were a big group and were able to sample many dishes, all very tasty. I didn't have to worry about ordering, as a the two Cantonese speakers in the group took care of that, but I did notice that the food just kept coming. Some of my past dim sum experience s have felt painfully slow ... not this one! Service was ultra quick. Overall a good time.   And for anyone with young kids, they've got the standard issue Ikea high chairs."}
{"text":"Compared to dimsum in Philadelphia, the dimsum here is generous in their seafood/beef ratio per piece. The flavors were on point!  It did seem beyond chaotic when we ate there on a Sunday afternoon. There were lines everywhere and the Chinese ladies were cooking on fry pans next to dining tables.  Despite the overly hectic environment, the dim sum was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was more than a restaurant, it was cultural experience! The food was great. We shared an order of large pork dumplings and they were delicious. A server brought an extremely hot pot of green tea to our table that was also very good after it cooled down a little bit. We didn't see a lot of tourists in the restaurant, it seemed to mostly be locals. The staff speaks some english, but not a lot. There were no menus on the tables, you order from the servers who circle the room with carts full of food. When you are done, you pay at the register on the way out. We really enjoyed the experience here, and highly recommend it if you are in Toronto. It's located just down the street from the Art Gallery of Ontario."}
{"text":"2.5 stars?  Not sure how this displaced Rol San in the most recent Blog T.O. Top 10 DS in DT Toronto. Food was decent and was nice to see the clear plastic tray covers but all dishes were served room temp. Carts are a novelty but they don't circulate evenly throughout the dining room, so what you get depends on where you sit.   Siu mai was a bit dry and got a piece of gristle. Fried shrimp & chive dumplings were too oily (not crispy enough). Tripe was decent. Turnip cakes were tasty and a good texture. Steamed pea shoots with cilantro soy were delicious. Spare ribs were room temp and gelatinous. Steamed shrimp dumplings were tasty but a touch overcooked. Had to ask for soy and chili oil (and only received a tiny bowl ~ 1.5 tbsp).   We were there for 80m without getting staple dishes like deep fried squid tentacles, deep fried shrimp dumplings, shrimp rolls, taro puffs, steamed BBQ pork buns, or sticky rice. Seemed like the same cart of egg tarts kept circling round our table while the tastiest dishes stayed well out of reach, getting snatched up within several feet of the kitchen.   Lots of tables so no wait time, even on a Sunday, but some things are worth waiting for..... like a table at Rol San."}
{"text":"No i won't come back here again, and yes that fast I can say it. It may be Dim Sum King but we had a table in the middle of the restaurant with very little carts to come to us for food. We literally walked away hungry because we didn't get the carts to come over to offer us enough selection. Their beef crepe noodle roll was average and it wasn't anything special. Chicken feet was delicious. Their spare ribs too tough to chew off the meat. We didn't stay there very long because it was too busy and they had a hard time getting us food."}
{"text":"Food: saw someone else mentioned at Yelp that food at Rol San is better, I agree. e.g. We had the bun with salted egg yolk custard, and the filling was a bit too runny compared to the same buns we had elsewhere.  For the price of the XL dim sum ($5.80), we would have expected better.  Setting: not so crowded, not so noisy, not so rushed (e.g. some busy restaurants rush you out the door once you're done eating), which was nice.  Service: good service!  We ordered the wrong tea, and the waitress brought us another pot, no problem.  But we didn't get the order form when we sat down, and had to order from the push carts.  The push carts didn't offer many different items, so we had to ask for the order form in order to get dim sum that we wanted to eat.  Not sure if that was because it was later in the day, or that's just how it works there, but I thought it was weird.  Tea: here, you could choose which tea to drink, whereas some other dim sum or Chinese restaurants don't give you a choice, so this is a plus.  Price: for about the same price (~$49 in total for two, including tax and tip), I would eat at Rol San instead.  Verdict: we enjoyed our experience at Dim Sum King, but I might choose another restaurant for lower price or higher quality of food."}
{"text":"Honestly dim sum in one place taste the same as it does to me in another place so I rarely choose a dim sum restaurant for the food quality. Although the asian friends of mine will tell me there is a huge difference between downtown vs uptown dim sum.  Not enough to get me north of the Bloor so this one has become one of my preferred locations to hit on dim sum Sundays. (Yes that is a thing)  They are able to accommodate large groups, I have had 12 people on one of their large tables once. The service is quick and the staff are great.   This is trolley cart dim sum but you can ask one of the many servers for something specific should it not come around or order from the menu.   Price wise it is good, obviously works out better when it is al large group.  Oh on a plus when you ask for hot sauce they don't stinge out."}
{"text":"Right from the start I have to admit that this review is skewed positively because I was at the restaurant for a big-ish event that was paid for by someone else.  With that being said, I really enjoyed the food I had today. I didn't personally order anything so, unfortunately, I don't know the names of the dishes. We started with some steamed shrimp dumplings that were quite tasty followed by fried tofu. The fried tofu had a nice crunchy exterior and a soft gooey interior. The tofu lacked flavour (as tofu often does) but there were multiple sauces available to make things more exciting. Again... I wish I could name the other dishes we had but most of them I didn't know what was ordered and just enjoyed the fare without asking too many questions. The one dish I want to rave about is the steamed BBQ pork buns. They were so light and fluffy but at the same time the meat packed a rich flavour. I think I ate 4 or 5 and probably would have eaten the whole plate if the others at the table allowed me to.  I haven't been to many dim sum places but I would certainly return here for a second experience!"}
{"text":"This place was such a nice place to go to have fun while eating and chatting with your family. It was a very well kept up restaurant. With a family friendly environment. The food was wonderful and well done."}
{"text":"It was recommended by Chinese masseuse as best Dim Sum in China Town. I agree that they serves authentic dim sum. We tried shrimp dumpling, steamed shrimp rice rolls, radish cake, steamed pork rib, egg tart and porridge with century egg and all of them were very testy. However, only chicken feet was not good."}
{"text":"- best downtown joint in my opinion. - plenty of chinese peeps eating here = good food / good deal / good value - dont be scared of dim sum - yes, dim sum is pork and seafood heavy...."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how anyone could enjoy the food here.  My boyfriend and I went on Friday night around 7, service was alright.  I knew we had to ask for condiments so after flagging a server down we were given soy sauce and hot sauce.  I asked about the ginger sauce which I could see on the table next to us and was basically told three times they don't make it until I pointed it out, at which point I was told that \"probably the kitchen can't make it, we're very busy right now\".  Huh?  You can't even ask?  There were a few dishes that probably would have been decent had there been a ginger sauce to go with it, particularly the one that said \"ginger and scallion\", because everything we ate was extremely bland.  I will happily eat food that is delicately flavoured and appreciate the subtle nuances, but this literally had none of that, no fragrance, no flavour, just oil and meat.  I'm honestly baffled."}
{"text":"The high ratings for this restaurant are perplexing to say the least. The place was packed to the brim on a Sunday. They do have cart service for dim sum which is getting rare however the quality of food and service lead me the conclusion that I am better of at a food court! The few items I tried were deviod of taste and the texture was even off for a shrimp dish. The yardstick for dim sum har gow was no where to be found even though we specifically asked for it.  Now for the service clumsy to alarming IMO we witnessed food being spilled on the clothes of patrons next to us without a hint of remorse. Dirty dishes being put on the cart that are also carrying foods that is being offered for sale. Servers that would ignore even after you have made an obvious contact. I thought the other popular spot for dim sum nearby was bad but this place is unacceptable. 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"What i like about this restaurant is that instead of ordering beforehand, waitresses / waiters push trolleys of delicious dim sum to you. Most of them understand Cantanese and the service is nice."}
{"text":"I usually eat here in the fundraising events. The food is not so good, especially seafood. ( I think they serve already died fish and lobster--I've already tried it) However, the price is cheap. A table with 12 dishes served for 10 people costs about $150."}
{"text":"Great first experience eating Dim Sum. Customer service was exceptional and the food was delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"*BE CAREFUL, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF* When my boyfriend and I got a table, they gave us a tea pot but since we don't drink hot teas, we asked ice water instead of the tea. Food was good and we enjoyed the meal. But when we got a check, I found out that there is extra 2 dollars on our check and asked the cashier about the money. She said they charged us for tea in a very rude way.. I asked her back 'We didn't even get the tea but we still gotta pay for it? We drank just water.' And she said 'Same thing for water.' HOW CAN THEY CHARGE US FOR TAP WATER??? I was upset and asked her I can't pay for just water and she gave me a really dirty look. SO RUDE.  I also remember even when I went there for the first time, they charged us extra and added tip so we ended up paying $5 more. At that time, I asked the cashier about the extra money but she just left with the money and never came back while speaking Chinese. Apparently, we double tipped because they added tip on our check.   I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT  BE AWARE OF THE BAD SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"The service is like no other.  You are treated as if you are royalty. If they had a red carpet, I am sure it would be rolled out. The selection of food is top notch and very tasty.  Everything is authentic and seems to be fresh. The atmosphere is a family one, so it's safe to bring the kids. Dancing and karaoke."}
{"text":"Ate: Dimsum  Drank: Tea  Liked: Pretty cheap.  Disliked: Some of the dishes weren't so good, like the radish cake.  Chicken: Nope.  The meat of choice at dimsum is pork.  Would mom like it?: Yep.  Mom loves dim sum.  It's her brunch.  Would I go back: It was fine,but probably not.  Recommend:"}
{"text":"I'm not used to eating dimsum downtown.  I always end up feeling disappointed.    The good thing here is the ladies pushing the carts seem pretty nice.  The restaurant itself looks pretty decent when you get up to the third floor.    The food was very average.  If you can come for the special early bird prices (9-11:30am) it's much more worth it.  At regular prices, not so much."}
{"text":"Very good and very large dim sum place. Food is carted around and you pick and choose what you prefer. Very important people have visited here so it is well known. Can't beat the price too."}
{"text":"An interesting Dim Sum place. I'll admit my knowledge of the cuisine is limited (shamefully I've only been to Dim Sum places a handful of times) but I found most things here very good. Some of the seafood dumplings were quite good. My gf really loved the curried cuttlefish complete with little tentacles. I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of those...  Service was very brisk and there seemed to be a good selection when we went. Only downside was the price (according to the gf) is a little high compared to some of the other options in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Foodora (which arrived quickly, as always). We got:  - Steamed Chicken Feet w/ Oyster Sauce (Excellent) - Pan Fried Seafood Pancake (A little on the oily side; would have preferred it to be a bit crispier, but it was tasty nonetheless) - Steamed Sticky Rice Pouch w/ Salted Meat (Not a lot of meat) - Steamed Beef Balls (Average) - Steamed Two Kinds of Meat Dumpling - siu mai (Nice texture, a bit firmer than other dim sum places) - Rice Noodle Roll w/ Minced Beef (Average) - Deep Fried Squid Tentacles (Average; note that these aren't the fully battered ones. They seem to be grilled instead) - Deep Fried Taro w/ Meat (Kind of soggy by the time they arrived but the filling was good) - Deep Fried Meat & Shrimp Dumplings (Unlike the fried taro, these held up quite well. Slightly crispy exterior but not a lot of meat fillings)  Overall, this is worth a try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The food quality is on par with places like Rosewood, but for me, Rol San still holds the #1 dim sum spot in Chinatown."}
{"text":"It's a hit and miss with the food. The dim sum is pretty good only when they come out hot, many times, we received the dish cold. For 3$ on certain dim sum, you can't go wrong. It's an Asian restaurant, so don't expect for it to be super clean. You're bound to see a few dirty plates, chopsticks or cups. Just ask a clean one to the waiter. As for the services, it's also a hit and miss. Depending on the days, service can be good, but other days, service can be pretty bad: rude waiters, forgetting to refill water even if asked many times. Depending on the time and day, services can be slow. Despite those tiny details, I always go there since the food is better than the other dim sum restaurants that's around the area."}
{"text":"My favourite dim sum place in Toronto because of the carts they serve the dim sum on and because the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This low end dim sum restaurant gives you exactly that.  This time around I only thought the congee and the beef balls were decent.  It just seemed like they lost their dim sum chefs.    The elevator was not working and it is on the 3rd floor. The entire building needs renovations and a clean up"}
{"text":"Took a while for the carts with the dishes I wanted to come around. If you arrive and order before 11 it's $2.80 a plate. The food is all good but none stood out..I think I will stick to Noble where I can order a la carte to ensure I get the dishes I want."}
{"text":"There are two kinds of Dim Sum experiences in Toronto. The al-a-carte version in which servers literally push carts around with fresh bamboo steamers of dim sum items around the floor calling out for people to pick what they want; the other being one in which you tick off the dim sum you want from a paper menu that you give to your server.   Dim Sum King is the former type of place and thus it is quite a fun and traditional experience. You will hear the constant calls from cart pushers yelling out each type of dim sum that they have and unless you know Cantonese, you probably won't make much sense of the noise. It doesn't hurt learn the Cantonese names of your favourite dishes over time but you will always find the servers friendly enough to do their best to explain or even just show you what's under each lid.  The food here is pretty good. I'd say on the higher end of dim sum quality but not the best. There are other places that will out do the quality but you'll have to head out to the suburbs to find them. For a downtown Dim Sum experience that captures the chaos of al-a-carte where the food is good and reasonably priced, then Dim Sum King is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait long, authentic, regulars from the community we're eating there, good selection, quality and price."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Everything tastes amazing.  I didn't have one bad thing here.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is due to the language barrier.  Sometimes it takes abbot to get across what you want to the waiters.  Check this place out of you want authentic amazing dim sum"}
{"text":"I'm hovering around a 3.8 - 4.0 after eating here.  Service was good only because the managers were hanging around the door where they have the small 1-2 people tables. Also their frying station, bussing/takeout/ hub area (?) was in the same area.   Ha gow wrappers were moist thin & looked beautiful with visible pieces of real (whole large size shrimp) but entire dumpling was bland. No condiments on table like hot pepper paste or soy sauce which would've elevated this dumpling to phenomenal. It was so delicious & I would say perfectly seasoned when consumed cold (which I did with my leftovers later than evening) which is truly how one are supposedly able to tell if food is prepared well with the proper amount of seasonings  Steamed/boiled sowpea greens are good with the dipping sauce provided.   Shrimp cheung fun & pork cheung fun tasted soft & freshly made.  Their soy sauce dressing was lighter (barely a light caramel soy sauce color) than I was used to in the NE USA corridor  Low baat guo (fried radish cakes) were okay.  The radish chunks were signify larger & somewhat tougher than I am used to. They were well charred but not crispy which was sad.  Again no dipping sauce was provided but they were really accommodating when asked (after they tried to tell me it doesn't need any sauces, they may have been correct on this one)  Siu mai were plumb, full of shrimp & pork/beef topped with a little red goji berry which added some herbal goodness & pop of color.   The fu pei guen (steamed tofu roll) was what i say around waiting on & was sadly disappointed.  These rolls usually have meat & bamboo (maybe other junk like mushrooms,  water chestnuts etc) wrapped in a bean curd sheet. They made theirs with no bamboo but instead was like a pot pie with carrot, peas and celery... to say that my wait was disappointing was an understatement & severely impacted their rating.    The ho fun was kinda disappointing.  Was more like thin ho fun with uneven soy sauce seasoning.  I could do better at home...  I was seated for a small table out of the carts' way.  70% made sure they were attentive to guests waving at them & came over to the small group area, but not the case with the popular items like hong gaow (chicken feet), rib tips,  etc. Akron to be fair,  after the first 2 times I did that,  they did come over if they saw me raise/wave  my arm.  This helped uplift their rating in my mind.   I was also disappointed by the small selection of steamed cart dim sum. There were like 6 items available.   I didn't see tripe, short ribs, chive dumplings. I had to stop one of the managers & ask for my fu pei guen because they just don't have it available on their carts.  Another uplift to their rating? Attentive waiters who filled my water glass.   I've already recommended Dim Sum King to a friendly lady stranger I met who have been to another place like 10 doors down and tried to tell me about them,  but didn't know about Dim Sum King which had all day 9a - 9p $2.80 (s,m,l sizes) dim sum Monday though Fridays."}
{"text":"We went shortly after the 9 AM opening and there was ample seating to choose from...but likely because people were still digging themselves out of the snowstorm!  Ladies wheel dim sum carts around and we were able to quickly fill our table and bellies with our favourites.  Service is quite prompt and pricing decent; dishes are charged based on sizes (have no idea how it works!) but I think we must have ordered 10 dishes for 3 people and the total was about $36!  We haven't been here for maybe more than 15 years and glad to see it's still doing well and among the dim sum favourites in TO."}
{"text":"I work for a long term care home nearby and we bring the residents here for dimsum every once in a while. Compared to all of the places that I go to uptown in Markham, I must say that this place has a few of the best dimsum dishes!    My favourite dish is the pan-fried vegetable and shrimp pancake :) So much shrimp filling and so delicious!   Overall, this place has a good variety of menu items and the food carts come quite frequently."}
{"text":"There was another dim sum place in the same location for many years. It was on the second and third floors. When that closed I paid no attention. So, when I was looking for a dim sum place near the AGO, Google brought this one up. You can hardly know it's here from the street. It's on the third floor only and there is an elevator. I was surprised at how nice it is (and modern washrooms too), how busy it is (I counted 250 people eating lunch) and how good the food is. On weekdays at lunchtime, the dim sum is only $3 for most dishes. Everything we had was fresh and much better than I've had at other places (on Gerrard at Broadview and on Spadina and in Markham). The prices are reasonable for the quality. The cart people all speak enough English to let you know what they have. In the old days they were not able to do that. So, I learned the names of dishes and I'm happy to ask things like \"Is the chung fun coming out soon?\" They maintain the tradition of siu mai and har gow on the same cart. Since there are no prices on the dim sum list, just 'sizes\" (which really are price categories) and the number of items. They also don't tell you the size until you get it. They sneak in a $1 charge for tea per person. This is a much nicer venue than the dim sum place on Spadina but at that one you order off a list with the prices, not from carts - gives you a choice."}
{"text":"I walked by on a Sunday morning and saw their poster about $2.3 for each dish regardless of L M S size before 11:30 am so I went in to give it a try. The food was ok, but the service was not that great: the cart appeared very infrequently with very limited options - I stayed from 10 to 11 and  only saw about 10 different things presented to me, ordered 4, and spent most of my time waiting for the next cart to arrive. I would much prefer what I experienced in other places, where you can place an order and pick things up from the cart too, that way you can save a lot of time and I am sure they sell a lot more food too.   There is a sign for 'free wifi', but I never found the password for it, and since I already had a hard time trying to understand the servers - they just assumed I could speak Cantonese and their attempt of other languages sounded equally challenging to me ... So I decided not to let them suffer from another question of mine, and all I did was point, nod, or shake my head during the whole ordering process  And there is tip from my experience: stick to the $2.3 deal for LMS, avoid the $5 'special-sized dish', while they are pretty good too, they are not really worth more than twice the cost."}
{"text":"Rating is for downtown dim sum (not comparing to markham). 3.5 rounded up to 4 because of service. Came here a little before 2pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. The interior surprised me because it was so large and spacious, with banquet hall style feel and cart service.  This was my first time here, and we experienced great service. All of the staff we interacted with were really friendly.  Food was good too! It was just two of us so we didn't get to order that much variety. But the sui mai and deep fried shrimp wonton stood out to me, and I would definitely order these again. (Tip: ask for the mustard and hot sauce). The pineapple bbq pork bun is pretty good too, though I'd prefer more bbq pork inside. Beef tripe was average. We also got the crab claw thing ($5 each) which was average as well. I'm used to eating that for dinner instead of dim sum.   All in all, I had a really good experience here. Enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food."}
{"text":"We came at 3:30 after the lunch rush and it was a complete miss. Least favorite dim sum experience and the food just didn't taste good. Soup dumplings lacked flavor, and the steamed dumplings were soggy and no well done. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"There's some great dim sum here. Unfortunately, it's meat heavy.   I told the server that I only ate vegetables, and she turned around with some of the best spinach and tofu wrapped veggie dim sum I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Came in around 2pm Friday so it was slow.   We were ushered to a table quickly and got tea and started.  Food price is reasonable.  Didn't like the walk up to the 3rd floor but food was good.  Shiu mai, har gaw, char Shiu,  we're all good. Didn't like the pan fried dumpling as much.  Over all good experience. Would recommend it and would definitely go again. I may take levator instead though..."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is the service. If there is a 0 star option, i wouldn't give it a 1 star. Just because the foods taste like garbage here. I was hoping to have better dimsum in Toronto, this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Definitely never coming back. We made the mistake of coming here on Mother's Day and it was a total disaster.  We actually got seated pretty quick but it went downhill from there. There were just a couple of dim sum carts going around, which wasn't enough to service all the hungry people. Literally, people had to get up to chase after the carts to get food.  It would have been comical if we weren't so hungry! We tried to order off the menu but were told that they weren't accepting any menu orders because of how busy it was (!!!).  This was made worse by the fact that the carts only went around the main outer areas so we had to join the crowd of dim sum chasers. We expected service to be slow because of the holiday but didn't think it would be an outright battle.  The food was okay but not worth the trouble. It wasn't super cheap for us two girls it was 46 dollars total.   The only reason I'm not giving this place a one or two star is halfway through the meal a manager did finally help us order food, though she wouldn't help us in the beginning. Maybe she sensed the hangry vibes emanating from our table."}
{"text":"Blast from the past. This dim sum restaurant has been around for as long as I can remember! Very traditional and super old school with the golden phoenix and dragon backdrop at the back of the restaurant and middle-aged Chinese ladies pushing around dim sum carts. This restaurant serves some pretty solid dim sum without breaking the bank. No frills, nothing fancy. Decent service. I would certainly be back."}
{"text":"Best dim sum I've ever had! I lived in China for a while and this place was better than anything I can remember. I've not been a huge fan of dim sum due to lots of disappointing experiences, but somehow Dim Sum King changed everything. My life is now brighter and it feels good to be alive. Before this life-altering experience, everything was a little bit grey, but I can see clearly now, the rain is gone. I can see all obstacles in my way. Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind. It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright, bright sun-shiny day."}
{"text":"I was feeling crappy after a crappy day at work. So my friend tried to cheer me up by taking me to this dim sum place. It's located on the 3rd floor of this pretty run down building in china town, so I was expecting it to be plastic table cloth. But stepping in it's like a hidden gem with nice table clothes and chair covers. Clean.   The shrimp and chives dumpling was good. The wrapping was not too thick or moist. The har gwa was not bad. I've also ordered the stuffed shrimp paste in egg plant. It was piping hot! Usually I don't eat bbq pork buns, my friend wanted so I ate one, that way she won't be stuck with eating 4 bbq pork buns. Not bad at all. The bbq was not too sweet as some sauce can be sweet. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Located close to the AGO, this place is on the farther end of Chinatown.  I use to go to Chinatown all the time when I was a kid, but rarely go back, mostly because it's a bit dirty and smelly compared to Markham/Richmond Hill and Mississauga where there are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores.    However, we came here for a get together with old friends from university and there were some definite pros - clean, old school dim sum on the carts (so you never know what you were getting), kid-friendly (a 3 year old and a 6 month old from my friends), and the servers and cart pushers speak English, which was a definite benefit  being the only Chinese person there (so I didn't have to translate everything!).    It was 7 of us (8 if you include the infant) and it was just over $80 including tip. Not bad considering we ate huge amounts.  We had the har gow, siu mai, fried squid, noodles, bbq pork bun, egg tarts, fried taro, and a lot more.  The dim sum is average, but it gets the extra star for it's service.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"Favourite Dim Sum place in Downtown Toronto! Monday - Friday (excluding weekends and Holidays) from 9am - 4pm all standard dumplings are $3. One of the best deals I've come across!   However, with all due respect I recommend going with someone who can communicate in Chinese for some of the staff members do not fully understand English. Aside from that it is a great experience!   Employees walk around with carts of different dishes. You are able to choose which dishes you want for your table! Authentic Dim Sum experience, as I've been told."}
{"text":"This place is very busy!  The carts came around pretty regularly but most of the items were either pan-fried or deep-fried. The steamed har gow and sui mei only showed up at the very end but we still ate it!  The dumplings were all pretty good and sizeable. In addition to the carts, there were also ladies walking around offering additional dishes such as gai lan and fried shrimp claws. The selection is quite good."}
{"text":"well for downtown Dim sum, it was pretty good.  I've had better but the place is big enough you don't have to wait.  Though you do have to wait for things to come around.  Went on a Sunday and I was surprised more carts weren't coming around.  I thought the selection was less than what I'd get at sky dragon though I find sky dragon more oily.  this is my second time here, last time I came during the week and I only thought it was ok.  Maybe cause the selection is less. But I don't like their har gow, they use more tapioca starch than wheat starch and I don't like it.  Though most people wouldn't notice that.  I'm curious to try the weekday again ..definitely not a place to go if you can't take your time."}
{"text":"Love this place! I don't get to come downtown often but if I ever feel like dim sum (yum cha), this is the place to go! (It's just a liiiiiitle loud on the weekends)  Cart service is on point. The ladies never miss a table. Other reviewers complaining about not getting cart service is kind of silly because they only serve it during 10-2pm. You can't get breakfast options at certain restaurants after 11am either and you don't complain about that either!  Service here is fast and waiters are attentive. It's super busy though so you may have to repeat yourself a couple times either because of the noise or because they forgot what you asked for (I don't blame them!)   Food tastes amazing. Can't complain! I loved their shiumai (excuse my bad spelling), hargow, shrimp dumpling and flat rice noodles. Yum!  On a separate note, I never got to get my chow fun dish that I saw being carted around on the other side of the room because it was just too loud for my baby and he was getting fussy. Had I been there without the babes, I would've gotten the chow fun lol"}
{"text":"Huge selection with decent service. The push cart ladies keep on a pushing with new treats coming to your table non stop.  I forget exactly what I had (I need to start reviewing sooner after my experiences) but everything was tasty.  While the service of the push cart ladies are acceptable, the other waiters seemed to just walk around in circles trying to avoid customers. We had to ask 3 different people for water and 10 minutes later we got it.  Even though we ordered too much, we ate it all and ended up paying $16 each, but a decent lunch or dinner could have been had for $10 each.  Probably one of the best places to get Dim Sum in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Located on the third floor of a nondescript building/mall, the large dining room looks dated in its decor and ambiance. The dim sum is better than average for Chinatown, with old-style push-cart service between 10 am - 2 pm, and very cheap if you go on weekdays ($2 per S, M, or L item), but avoid weekends when the price is almost doubled ($3.30 M, $3.80 L). Notable items: Har gow, chicken feet, steamed rice with spare ribs, pot stickers, pan-fried turnip cake. Tea is extra @ 80 cents/person. Overall service is adequate but tired."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with great food. I was suspicious at first because I came at five and no one was here but by six the place was packed. There is something for everyone here. Authentic dim sum, Peking duck, fish, lobster, etc. for those who want Americanized Chinese food they have that too. The prices are great. At first the service wasn't great but then we met Tommy. Tommy was an awesome waiter. Ask for Tommy."}
{"text":"Horrible. We ordered food to go and it took them over 2 hours to get our food. I understand that restaurants can be busy but 2 hours for a few orders? Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Old school dim sum complete with the dim sum carts being pushed around in Chinatown!   Quite a busy place with lots of the local older Chinese enjoying their daily tea mixed in with many tourists (they really tried to explain what's in the food to non Chinese speaking patrons)!  The dim sum offered is the \"typical\" traditional dim sum and not a lot of the fancy (read expensive) varieties that we see in some of the more upscale dim sum places around Toronto.     For the most part food was taste and the temperature was decent.  Food was covered with lids and the plates were all covered with a large plastic lids (that's NOT old school-that's progress!).  They have a flat price for small,medium,large for $3/ plate which is good value.   This is our go to dim sum place in Chinatown and worth a shot."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, the Dim Sum here was pretty solid. My go to are the \"La Sau Bao\", Beef Rice Rolls, Shrimp Rice Rolls. Everything is really fresh and it reminds you on the classic Dim Sum spots in Chinatown. I would come back here if I ever find myself in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"So... some updates here after having sampled the dim sum ecosphere of Toronto. Best place in Toronto for DS, for sure. I love Rol San but-- a little less crazy, equally good food, and cheaper. Top pick in the city, baby!  -- Inspired by eurocup playing in front of me. Active commentary as dim sum plates stack in front of me. Green pepper stuffed with shrimp. Oily goodness. Delicious. First taste. Feeling the King in Dim Sum King right now. Spinach turnip cake. More turnip than spinach, ratio is week, but liking it. No soy sauce at the table but hot sauce automatic without asking. Oh King, you so different. Comment from the table: turnips can be tasted. Good job on the inefficient purée job. Ten points to the summer intern for doing it right. Just got another plate set down. I think I've officially seen about 200 different waiters and waitresses at this point. King is fuelling the Canadian economy in a big way. TVs everywhere. Iceland and France still 0-0.  Had to take a break. 2-0 France. Have consumed lots of food. Barbecue pork buns good to awesome. Shrimp dumplings and chive and shrimp dumplings so good. Best I've ever had. Siumai top 10 ever had. Octopus curry something something was passable. Seafood pancake ... Wrap it up with a siumai to make an (authentic) Chinese siumai pancake roll-up (18th century delicacy) and it's the best you've ever had. I may sell this out of a food truck soon... Heard it here first.  Overall, really good. Great venue. Fine Toronto dim sum. Ready to go home and nap."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went on Sunday for early dinner. There are 2 or 3 set of stairs to go before reaching the restaurant. The place was busy, but not fully packed. We were seated in a corner, so it was quite hard for the servers to notice us whenever we wanted to call them.   We ordered 4 kinds of dim sum (beef balls, spare ribs with black pepper sauce, siu mai and shrimp and chives dumpling - har gaw) + 1 menu dish of beef stir Fry rice noodle ($11+). The shrimp and chives dumplings are the best out of these 4. Overall, dim sum was okay, I've had better in other places I visited, I'd give a 5 or 6 out of 10. On the other hand, the beef rice noodle was good, especially with chilli sauce.   Service was not that quick. We ordered dim sum first and ordered rice noodle 5-10mins later. And we got the latter first, and dim sum came in 5-10mins after."}
{"text":"Best dim sum I can find downtown. Always a great experience and great food. Would give more stars but it's not the best I've had (although close). The best I've had is Perfect Chinese Restaurant in Scarborough.   But for a good price on great dim sum - this is the best downtown has to offer."}
{"text":"The best dim sum I've had in downtown Toronto. They have a good selection if you go around noon. It can get really packed, but it's worth the wait. I'd recommend the BBQ buns which remind me of the ones from Tim Ho Wan in terms of texture, dumplings, and wrapped rice."}
{"text":"This was my second time came to Dim Sum King and I brought a Canadian white guy with me. Ordered the dim sum dishes. So many things wrong with this place, to make it easier to read, I will use points: 1. Give us a pot of tea without asking, cost us $2 at the end.  2. Terrible tea, crumble leaves and tasteless, such an insult to a Chinese customer.  3. The food look nothing like the photos on their website. Beef stomach is orange colour, Black pepper (bean sauce) short ribs was pink in the centre showing an evidence of frozenness.  4. No any sauces was offered on the table.  5. Sneakily run up the numbers for us on the bill.   We did the calculation in out head and on on phone, we showed the waiter the number was wrong, he said \"OK I will ask them to calculate\" with a big attitude! He returned not only the right bill, but a calculator, threw them on the table as in we don't know how to do math. Funny enough, my friend is a mathematician who is also a guy who has principles. We paid and left and that was probably the first time in our life to not leave a tip for a meal.   This is a Cantonese restaurant, it's part of Chinese cuisine but can never present the whole Chinese cuisine.  If you want decent Cantonese food with great service, try Luckee which is 15mins away by walking. At least, it's owned by a Master Chef Canada, and you will get what you expected!"}
{"text":"Officially aboard the Dim Sum train (not surprised that I love it considering my affection for the concept of shared plates). I was down with the entire vibe of this place: loud in both volume and color scheme. I felt like I was at a wedding with the sea of tables for groups, DJ, and ladies line-dancing (I think there actually was some sort of celebration going on). We felt a bit rushed to get our order in, but it may have served us better in the long run because we needed to get to a show anyway. I loved just about everything we tried. The only thing I wasn't on board with was the steamed shrimp dumplings--I am just not about the \"wet noodle\" taste. Among my favorites were the steamed BBQ pork bun (could've just eaten a plate of that to myself), pan-fried turnip cake with salted meat (everything about this...just YES), deep fried durian pastry (quite unexpectedly..and it didn't have the dreaded smell that usually accompanies durian), and the veggie soup dumplings. Plates were brought out in odd proportions (a lot at once, and then about a plate at a time), but overall everything was too tasty to even care. Excellent introduction to dim sum and to Toronto's Chinatown!"}
{"text":"This place is open and airy, which are two things I like in a dim sum restaurant.  It also has cart service, which is mandatory for any legit dim summer.    You have to be careful with these fellas though.  During 'happy hour' (I call it happy hour but I don't think they do, I think it's 11AM-4PM on weekdays and before noon on weekends) every dish is $2.20.  That's what they advertise.  So how is it that 6 dishes can leave you with a total bill of $26.35.  I've investigated this on several occasions testing the procedures at the cash and I have reached the following conclusions:  (1) Tea is not free.  In fact, it costs anywhere from $1.50 to $3.00 per person.  If you don't want the tea, tell them no thanks when they drop it on you at the outset.   They will look at you like you just turned down free tea, but of course you know better.  (2) Any dish not taken off a cart carries an additional charge between $5.00-$7.00.  Stick to the carts.  If you just need something and can't wait then ask for it but make sure it is marked off in the standard part of the dim sum card, otherwise it will cost you a lot more.  (3) Tax...call it 28% roughly.  (4) The lady or gentleman at the cash does not follow any schema for doing maths.  He or she will write a series of numbers on top of one another with lots of lines, as though they are calculating something and totalling up the numbers.  The result will be higher than expected every time and they will not give you this document.  In any event, enjoy the dim sum but watch out for the nickel and diming.  ***ADDENDUM - the 'happy hour' deal is not available on holidays.  The definition of holiday includes every day between Christmas and New Years."}
{"text":"We have ordered on under eats and have had the same issues over and over with dim sum king. All we want is some extra hot sauce for our $50-60 food order. That's it!!! They NEVER give it even though we put it in the special request box. Called and complained after the 3rd time not getting the requested hot sauce and they said that the cook guys don't look at the special request boxes - ok??..... anyhow boss guy said to call after ordering from Uber eats and let them know directly of any special request. Ok will do. A bit inconvenient, but whatever (we really like their hot sauce). Long story short, just got my order and you guessed it- NO EXTRA HOT SAUCE (just half of the smallest sauce containers out there- they couldn't even fill the 1 hot sauce container 3/4) and this is WITH the reminder call. Anyhow, we're ready to call it quits with restaurants who do not respect their frequent and loyal customers. Truth be told, we only like this place because of the shrimp/chives pucks. Everything else is not as tasty as Rol SAN.   They apologized and gave us a credit on our next order."}
{"text":"Up three flights of stair (or an elevator ride) is a sweet stop for dim sum.  Classic fare tasting fresh from carts that are rolling swiftly by... good service, clean place, lots happening here!!"}
{"text":"It's on the upper floor (3rd) of a small mall in Chinatown. The elevator takes a while, so if possible, I would suggest just taking the stairs. The place itself is quite large, but very often different groups hold lunches/dinners here, so parts of the space is sectioned off. For dimsum, they have carts that push things around and some staff carry different items around, but the variety and frequency can be quite limited Monday through Friday unfortunately. The food itself is very hot, but can be quite oily. Service is okay but staff are quite inattentive with things like refilling water."}
{"text":"Went there last week at 2pm ... The dim sum was unbelievable delicious.  Very fresh food. Stuff was very friendly and they spoke English. It wasn't busy at that time.  The restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"In a world where cart dim sum service has largely become an inexplicable endangered species in Toronto's Chinatown, Dim Sum King still does cart service..... in the daytime only, that is, according to a server (which is quite the standard deal with traditional dim sum service). Otherwise it's the a-la-carte off an order sheet deal as to maintain their all-day dim sum restaurant cachet (dim sum, much like gwai-lo brunch, is generally a cuisine traditionally served in daytime). Food arrives on a cart regardless, but it's not the same.  But what do I know?--information on where cart service still survives in town circa 2015 is generally outdated, even from Yelp. Chinatown might as well be a writeoff on the topic, as the places that does cart service either ceased doing so completely, only do it in limited periods not well communicated, or in cases like Forestview across the street, closed down. Restaurants might as well advertise they do cart service as a selling point (I feel like making another Yelp list...).  Anyways, THE LATE ENTRY: you walk in in the early evening with a friend who's expecting to be schooled on the yum cha cart service experience after reaching the third floor of a very grimy and unkempt building to find a traditional large Chinese banquet hall style restaurant (apparently they also do ballroom dancing sessions at certain evenings). You direct your attention to a window-facing table that in the glaring evening sun despite the blinds deliver enough solar gain to make you feel like sweating at a summertime patio. Don't sit by the windows--oh, too late for that. I'm melting, melting!  FAST ORDER, SLOW FOOD: you will have multiple staffers swarm at you eager to take your order sheet the moment you finish it. Then comes the inexplicable long wait for your food, perhaps close to an hour for a mere handful of dim sum dishes. You sit bored by the golf on the TVs everyone ignores (watching golf is boring as fuck, yes?) and salivating at the peking duck served traditional-style to other tables. You bring up the delay with a manager, who then disappears for the next 15 minutes until long after the first set of food finally arrives on your table. Primal instincts sees the food devoured quickly. Then comes another long-ass wait for another batch of food. Rinse and repeat.  THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY OF CHOICES: in terms of dim sum, the food here is either surprising good or bad, but they all come to you piping hot. Some choices include: - Siu mai: juicy and flavourful with the goji berry on top. - Honey lemon glazed short ribs: so sweet and delicious - Curry octopus: absolutely no curry taste. Tiny octopus taste like something between calamari and raw fish. Ugh. - Steamed spare ribs (pai gwoi): bloody disappointing tiny chopped pieces, little meat. For about 10 plates it works out to about $20/person. You have to ask for whatever sauces you want, nothing's provided right off the bat. Fucks sakes lah.  YES I DID ORDER FRIES WITH THAT: of all the stuff that slowly arrives, you realize they missed one thing you ordered. You bring it up with a staffer, who surprisingly delivers it quickly, not before a manager marks \"+1\" on your order sheet. The confused you argue with three different uncoordinated staffers over whether you \"extra ordered\" the missing dish or if anyone took care of the bill. You get a sense of how disorganized things are here, despite the odd cart service marker sheet on your table that they use to keep track of service no matter what service type it is. You convince them they're in the wrong and they dump a dessert plate of almond cookies your way, which I guess is to be interpreted as an implied apology for the snafu. Don't be impressed.  You can see why a-la-carte order sheet dim sum can be an unenjoyable and definitely inauthentic experience, as opposed to watching carts and old ladies go by.  THE TREK OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF DIM SUM HELL: The highly inconsistent quality of food and totally piss-poor downhill service of Dim Sum \"King\" isn't really a surprise when you're over the years used to seeing how lousy Chinese restaurants can be with quality and courtesy.  Cart service or lack thereof, traditional Chinese dining in Toronto's Chinatown is largely now for tourists and late-night hipsters who relish in the patronizing cachet of eating in Chinatown. The rest of us have generally given up on Chinatown (both West and East) and are well aware of the \"yellow flight\" of more quality Chinese dining experiences to the 'burbs (although even that can be a crapshoot). That being said, if I knew I was going to spend three hours mostly cannibalizing the bile in my stomach, I would have suggested the hell with seeking cart service and gone to Rol San instead."}
{"text":"So I went here around 3 o'clock in the afternoon On a Sunday so maybe they were on lunch so we didn't receive the best service possible however we did order from the menu food came quickly didn't have a lot of flavour but not extremely shocked"}
{"text":"Terrible service and frozen-dim-sum-like quality food!    Service: Even for Chinatown standards this place's service is bad! Carts couldn't get to us (which is fine b/c we were seated in a bad location and it was a busy afternoon).  In such a case ladies would make a decent effort to ask if you wanted anything or the waitresses would take your order and get us food.  Here, no one asked us and the waitress refused to take our order saying that's not her job.    Then when we finally got food at our table the same waitress moved a dish off the table towards my friend while she had her chopstick in the steamer saying to get out of her way while she cleared out table.  At this point I lost it and told her off and asked for the manager.  The manager finally came and I gave her a ear full and then some but to no avail.   Food: If service bad and food is ok then that's ok, but if service and food are bad then hell-to-the-no-way!!!!  The dim sum tasted like the frozen ones you get from the supermarket.  We ordered the usual fair and one of the dishes that came was RANCID (I kid you not).  Finally I saw the worst possible thing, they recycle the sauces.  We ordered fried shrimp dumplings that had mayo for dipping sauce.  We had a lot left over and when they cleared the plate I saw the lady recycle our mayo back onto another plate - disgusting or what?    Bottom Line: Don't go unless you want to pay for people to treat you bad and overpay for frozen dim sum."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning alone. There were a lot of other diners, but I was seated immediately at my own table. All the dishes I had were good, but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Update:   We came back on a weekday, lunchtime. The service is extremely attentive this time and we got to try different kinds of food. It was overall an amazing experience!   Strongly recommend this place for weekdays since it's super busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"I've been craving for some dim sum and decided to come here for brunch with a friend.   My reasons to check this place out: 1) We've never been here  2) Cart Service   We were seated quickly upon arrival, and as usual we were asked what tea we'd like to have.  Then the carting game began. No-no-yes-no-yes-yes.   We both loved the squid. It was perfectly cooked - soft and juicy.  Siu mai, egg tart, sesame ball, and wanton were alright.  Har gaw was above alright, so it was good.   Weekdays, before 4pm dim sum is $2.50."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with the tour group when visiting Toronto. I think this place is pretty good for the seafood. The most memorable items were the crab, lobster and also fish. We also got a dish of tofu, baby bok Choy, chicken, beef broccoli, and chicken. At the end we also got some oranges.  It was family style and we sat with two other families. The amount of food they ate were little so I had a chance to eat a lot of the lobster and crabs. I think the seafood was pretty fresh and I was impressed with the quality. I don't know if I would go back to eat there on my own but with the tour group I think it was decent. I don't even know how much it was but I'm going to guess very expensive."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night specifically for the dimsum. The place is on the top floor of a three storey building. It was very spacious and they even have a dance floor. There had a lot of tables for large groups with a revolving plate centerpiece like any other chinese restaurant. The  dimsum menu was handed to us as soon as we sat down. This was my first time visiting a traditional dimsum place. The ordering process was very streamlined and efficient. We marked our orders on the menu and they would get them to us in carts. The food kept coming as it was ready and we didn't have to wait at all. It's great if you are in a hurry and need to stop for a quick lunch. I really liked the pork and chive dumplings with peanuts and sui mai. The night we visited they had a live music and dance performance. I would definitely come here again when I am craving some dimsum."}
{"text":"Service here was honestly pretty bad. We had to ask at least 10 times (that's right, 10 times) for some chili oil and soy sauce. When they finally brought it out, they brought it out in a small sauce plate. Not even a bottle of either one. One of our server's got upset at us because we ordered our dim sum wrong even though we weren't given clear instructions on how to order. It was almost as if our food wasn't cared about. It took them quite a long time to bring our food out and the server's never really checked on our table or answered our requests until like the fifth time we asked them. And it wasn't like this place was busy. This place had like 5 other tables filled and we were the biggest party (13 people). They also forgot to bring out a bunch of food items we ordered. Service was probably the worst part of this place.  Food here was like any other regular dim sum, nothing special. It wasn't worth the wait though. If I had to say what my favorite menu item was though, I'd probably say the deep fried shrimp roll (#34).  Wouldn't really recommend this place. Either go somewhere else in the downtown Toronto area or another restaurant in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Located a couple blocks east of Spadina and Dundas. Came here on a Friday for a dim sum lunch. Restaurant was about 80% full around noon. Restaurant is spacious and took little time to get a table for 6 people. Decor is better than most dim sum restaurants in downtown Chinatown.  What's great about Dim Sum King is they still offer push cart service which not many new dim sum restaurants offer. Being able to see and smell all the wonderful dim sum passing by our table really adds to the experience and helps in deciding which items to order.  Their weekday lunch special is $2.80 for small/medium/large. They also have extra large dim sum which costs more. I enjoyed all the items we ordered especially the squid tentacles and beef ribs.  Will definitely come back again for some more dim sum. Price is good and quality is better than most places."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 10am for dim sum.  If you order before 11am all dishes are $2.80. We ordered the main staples: haw gow, sui mai, shrimp/meat rice noodles, chicken feet, meat balls, shrimp balls, radish cake, sticky rice, spare ribs, black bean chicken & mango pudding.  I had better at other places but the price here was cheap.  May come back. Pretty spacious restaurant with lots of tables."}
{"text":"Amazing service matched with amazing food. It was very delicious and I highly suggest the pork bun. This is definitely a place to eat at if you go to China Town."}
{"text":"It was okay. They didn't have many options (perhaps 8 items from which to choose), so didn't get to try much; what I did try was serviceable and unmemorable. 2.5 - 3 stars for the food.  Service was dreadful, and I say this only because there were 24 people in a 400-seat restaurant with at least 8 servers (not cart pushers), and not a single one ever came to our table. I don't expect much at dim sum, so I'm only making a comment rather than slamming the restaurant - if you eat here, just go in with an open mind and the expectation of no service. The cart pushers are very active, but without many options, they keep cycling the same dishes around and around. Perhaps I need to try at peak time instead of off-hours."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are consistent, delicious and amazing overall.   Service is ok during busy times. Large space with a small army of girls serving dim sum off the cart.   Food is awesome. Ordered many dishes and they were all delivered to an acceptable standard.   This place is expensive and can add up real quick if you're not careful.   Average about $4-5 a dish and depending on how hungry you are 6-8 dishes will do the trick.   The food though is great quality and so it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The dim sum is acceptable, but rather mediocre. Rol san is easily a notch or 2 higher. This is my rol san backup. The big plus here is that it's a huge restaurant, so you'll probably get seating even for a bigger group.  Must try: - Tofu fa. Hard to get at downtown dim sum, so they win points here for scarcity.  Recommended: - Beef tripe. A couple bad pieces, but overall it is quite good. This is another dish which can easily be screwed up at mediocre dim sum, so it's worth ordering here. - Sticky rice  Meh: - Cha siu bao. Somehow they screwed this up a couple times. Clumpy in all the wrong places. - Curry squid. Some good pieces, some bad. If it was all good pieces, it would be great. If it was all bad pieces, it would be vomit worthy.  Those were the dishes that stand out. I'll update as I remember more or return. I'm pretty sure the ha gow is fine."}
{"text":"We went there 2weeks ago for dimsum around 4-5pm. The place was partially booked for party and it was quite busy at that time. Luckily we came on off-peak hour and our order was came almost together. I like their black bean spare ribs and siomay. Too bad that they out of fried dough. We will come again to try our luck when they have lunch promotion ( dim sum $2.80/portion S-L size)"}
{"text":"First time having dimsum in Chinatown in a long time since there are a lot of great options uptown. Worth going downtown for this place. All the dishes were delicious and they have a great variety of options. Also love that they still serve it in the pushy carts. The only negative comment I have is service is lacking."}
{"text":"I can imagine that on weekends and holidays, the dining room at Dim Sum King is packed to the gills.  However, today at 2:30 pm between the hours of lunch and dinner, I sat at one of five occupied tables in this very large dining space.    What drew me to Dim Sum King?  Well, I was thoroughly enjoying the one of a kind experience of strolling through Toronto's Chinatown, and the need for food hit me like a cuttle fish swing to the face.  As I walked eastward on Dundas, I had many an option - Chinese BBQ, bubble tea, dim sum.  Hmmm.. the urge to go to the restaurant where I'd most likely be the only \"round eye\" overcame my appetite, and dim sum won.  So I climbed the stairs to Dim Sum King.  It did take a while for my server to collect my sheet of paper.   My water glass was also barely refilled as I ate up my too-much-for-one-person order of dim sum.  I ordered a noodle roll filled with duck, custard buns, fried pork spring rolls with taro, and a tofu roll with more meat etc. in it.  I found all to be really enjoyable, the noodle roll probably being my favorite.    This was a 2:30p meal, so it was not the prime time to witness classic dim sum carts being pushed around.  However, there is a HUGE bonus to going to Dim Sum King outside of busy hours.  Before lunch, between lunch and dinner, then after dinner, Dim Sum King has what it calls Dim Sum Happy Hour... where each order of dim sum is only $2!!! Holy moly!!!  I ordered four different tasty items for a mere $10!  It seemed like a steal.    While I enjoyed the food and the staff was certainly pleasant although not the most attentive, my guess is that better dim sum does exist somewhere in the world.  Probably right here in Toronto.  However, paying $2 for each item during Dim Sum Happy Hour is enough to recommend Dim Sum King."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decently priced dim sum place in Chinatown, I'd recommend coming here. It's the type of old school dim sum restaurant you find in China. The old ladies roll around with cart of dim sum and you just order as you see them coming around. We came on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't too crowded. We were able to get a seat right away. Lots of variety of food and everything tasted fine. Great place for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Dim Sum King is located in Chinatown. Street parking is available but may be difficult to find. The restaurant itself is located on the third floor of a shopping center; just follow the signs and keep going up those stairs, then go through the double doors; they may not look like a restaurant entrance but the restaurant is behind those doors.  Dim Sum King is a more traditional dim sum restaurant, with carts rolling across the floor of the restaurant offering various dishes to the patrons rather than the patrons sitting down and ordering from a checklist. Having only been to the latter (and poor ones at that) in the past few years, the carts threw me off a loop for a moment, but thankfully past experience  took over, and I was able to enjoy myself. It was a good thing, because the food here was really good.  The dumplings felt fresh instead of reheated from frozen, and the turnip cake was spot on. On the flip side, we weren't automatically given any condiments to sprinkle over our dishes.  Dim Sum King is a busy place. The entire time we were there, most of the tables were full and buzzing. It was fast paced most of the time but not consistently so; I noticed that sometimes three or four carts would be passing by our table within seconds of each other. Other times, many minutes would pass before any cart would appear. I also noticed that many of the dishes I had enjoyed at the dim sum places I had been taken to as guest of others fluent in Chinese did not appear near us during our time at Dim Sum King.  On the other hand, the same carts/dishes would reappear often. I don't know if this might be because we weren't there long enough for those other dishes to show up, and/or because I didn't know enough Mandarin to ask the servers to fetch me those other carts/dishes.   I would like to come again, and maybe   on the heavy/oily side. It is traditionally served with Chinese hot tea because the hot tea serves as a palate cleanser and helps the system digest."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum service! I only eat seafood so I ate shrimp dumplings (ha gow and the fried dumpings). Can't go wrong with this spot, they have a good special too, $3 for certain dishes in the morning. It gets busy around 12pm.   Overall the service was great and the food was delicious. The dumplings were cooked/steamed nicely none of them were mushy. Good to come for breakfast/early lunch with family or a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing cart service. Very impressive. Carts were consistent and had much variety. Best cart style dim-sum I've found in the city core.  The only downside for me, which isn't a big deal, is that it is not meant for one as many of the dishes are family sizes, although not all.  Limited my selection a bit but outside of that,great for couples and family."}
{"text":"Omg... This is one of the worst Dim Sum places!  So bad, I did not waste my time taking pictures.  Be aware, look ok, but tasteless.  I order an chicken dish with mushroom.... one small mushroom  and it tasted spoiled and bad.  Mention to the waiter and all he said was ok like he care, he will take it off the bill.  Definitely not a repeat for me.  Service is slow.  Gives Dim Sum a bad name!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum, but not great. We were disappointed that it was ordering from a menu card, not a cart, but I think that's just because we went at dinnertime instead of lunch (not sure). The service was good -- a little fussy as some have said, but actually in a friendly way. We were a mixed-Asian family up visiting from the States, and several of the servers chatted with us about things to do and see (and eat) in town.  The chicken feet and siu mai were OK, but not amazing. The sesame balls, on the other hand, were about the best I've had (and I've had a lot!) Don't tell my father-in-law, but they were every bit as good as his homemade. The hom sui gok (little fried pork/glutinous rice footballs) were outstanding as well."}
{"text":"So we went here based on good yelp scores on the old name that it was under. Then when I went to review I found they have another listing! I wonder how many names it has been through. Conspiracy theory says restaurants do this to evade taxes. Not sure, does not bother me. I was hoping for dim sum with cart service, which I have never had, but this did not happen. We came at dinner time, around 5 pm. After finding the restaurant (go up two flights of stairs from random opening, but well marked with signs) we were ready to eat and the retaurant, which has a HUGE dining room, was deserted!!!! There were staff inside, watching tv, and we asked \" are you open?\" and they immediately sprang into action, seated us, brought tea and water, and bout us menus. Unfortunately there was no cart running due to lack of clientele, but we were able to order finger foods off the dim sum menu.  We ordered 6 items to split, some small, some medium and large. They were out of the egg cake, which I think was highly reccomended on some reviews. The pork bun was perfect. Everything I ever wanted from a dumpling. Everything was freshly made for us and bought out 1-2 items at a time. I noticed large group tables with a lazy suzan that look perfect for sharing lots of delicious foods. Even though we did not get cart service, we enjoyed ourselves and had yummy dim sum!"}
{"text":"Was craving for dim sum on a recent trip to all mighty Canada, and made a stop at dim sum king. There are plenty of other dim sum joints on the same street, but with a title like king, I had to try it.   This place is a order style dim sum joint, which I have no problem with. Ordered your usual selection of shumai, hargow, and a select assortments of tarts, chicken feet, spareribs (which are bomb), and rice noodle wrapped dishes. Everything was very good, and the place was clean and quiet. Very solid dim sum, with decent service. If I ever find myself in toronto again, will definitely hit up this spot if I'm craving for dim sum :)"}
{"text":"Really disappointed! The beef offals are like dried weed. And the pork and preserved egg congee is also like made of \"Used\" meat. The beef stomach tastes like plastic. Others are generally ok."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLACE! I waited over an hour for certain dim sum carts to come around. Then I asked 3 people for the Shrimp rolls and they brought me spring rolls - the manager guy YELLED at me for not being \"clear\". And they charged you $2 for tea. I left HUNGRY as I could only get 2 dishes during the 1.5 hours I was there. I'm gonna stop and get a submarine now"}
{"text":"Great dim sum restaurant and superb service! Tea was constantly refilled and the trolley ladies were very friendly! Prices are also very competitive relative to other downtown dim sum places.  I think the key is to sit near the aisles where the dim sum trolley goes by. Happy dim sum-ing!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 for the food  4.5/5 for service  The food carts came around very frequently even though we were sat in a corner.  We ordered a variety of dimsum - chicken feet, sesame ball, short ribs, egg & pork congee, rice rolls etc. The quality was on par with fmost  dimsum restaurants; taste was nothing special but not a poor experience for sure.  Overall positive experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I recently visited Toronto during our one-week stay. During the 7 days, we ventured to Dim Sum King two times and I'd like to share my thoughts of the establishment.   Dim Sum King is an authentic restaurant that serves traditional Cantonese cuisine that vary from family-style to dim sum dishes. Good dim sum is rare from where we come from, so it was a goal for us to find dim sum while we're in Chinatown. Thus, we stumbled upon \"Dim Sum King\" after doing various searches on our slow, wireless phones.   - Dim sum (5/5) - you order off a menu, so no cart service (we visited during non-morning times though). Each dish is roughly $2.75-3.00 CAD and is great in portions. Some go-to's are the char siu bao, shu mai, har gow, egg yolk custard, and cheong fun   - Customer service (4/5) - the environment is fast paced and sometimes they can forget about you if there are lots of customers. This is typical of an Asian restaurant, so don't take it for offense. Just simply get their attention and move on. In our second visit, there were less people present so we had full attention and even got dessert on the house   Dim Sum King satisfies that crave for good Cantonese food at a fairly affordable price. You cannot go wrong with this place on your next visit to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"*** Be Careful, We Were Overcharged *** We went to Dim Sim on the Weekend after the cart service had finished for the day. On the menu each item is either listed as \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\" or \"x-large\" and the prices corresponding to the size are printed at the bottom. The food was quite good, in particular the traditional dumplings, the steamed shrimp dumplings and the beef ribs.  We ordered 2 \"L\" items, 1 \"M\" item and 2 \"S\" items which should have costed $4.80, $4.00 and $3.00 each respectively. We anticipated a bill of around $20 however the final amount is not marked down until you go to the front to pay. When we went to pay the manager scribbled down some notes in Chinese and said our total was $38 + tax = $45 about twice what we were expecting. Unfortunately we didn't question her calculation and paid the total, it was only after that we came to the conclusion we were overcharged. The food and service (up until the end) were quite good though."}
{"text":"Found this place walking down the street.  A local said it was good and had dim sum which we liked.  We sat down and they brought a bunch of dishes to review which we took most of. Then mysteriously the carts stopped.  We waited and waited and I finally asked if more food was coming out.  They said we had to order off the menu.  We ordered a few more items and they questioned why so few. Had to explain we already ate a bunch.    I have no idea how much each item was. Our bill came to $41.70 which included 4 cans of pop.  Seems to be reasonable for what we ate.  The food was decent.  Not the best dim sum that we have ever had but it was enjoyable.  We saw locals eating non-Dim Sum and their portions looked large."}
{"text":"Worse dim sum place I've been in toronto so far.  Horrible service...The staff acknowledges you but ignores you.   Food is below average if you manage to get some food at your table.   There are plenty of dim sum places in toronto so spare yourself from the horrible food and service from this place."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best overall experiences I have ever had.  Visiting Toronto, my friend had asked what I wanted for brunch. I said, \"you pick\". He asked if I liked dim sum and the rest was history.  Dim Sum King Seafood Restaurant is a traditional dim sum restaurant. It's enormous. It's loud; from the carts being pushed around, the wait staff asking you if you want their dish, and the guests chatting away. Dozens of carts being pushed around, all with amazing dishes that you have to try.  The pricing I don't get and honestly I didn't care how much anything cost at the moment. If I wanted it, I got it.  You have a waiter. Ours was ok. The main focus here is on the dim sum, not on your waiter. We drank water faster than he could keep up so he left us a pitcher. Problem solved.  The sticky rice with pork and the fried shrimp were out of this world. The spare rib was to die for. I'm still thinking about it now.  You have to pace yourself. We picked too much too soon and have to call it quits too early. Don't say yes because you're hungry.   Enjoy this one of a kind experience. You'll love it. I did and can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Wow! Yum yum yum!  My colleague from China brought a group of us here for lunch. He swears by this place and I was a skeptic because I've been to many dim sum places and didn't think this could be much special.  The place doesn't feel like much as you trek through china town and up the 2 flights of stairs to this place... Once you are there, you sit and are inundated with people asking if you want things... And once you fill your table with way too much food (eyes are always bigger than the stomach), you figure out just how great the food is.  Everything was delicious!  Definitely try the pork buns, egg tart, dumplings, and chicken feet... Really everything was great! I left way too full."}
{"text":"Dim Sum here was great!!! Love the see the carts which you rarely see anymore... food was great! Everything we had was fresh and tasty. Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Should be called dim sum clowns. Horrible undercooked dim sum after we were studiously ignored for 45 min and literally were forced to shove the ordering slip in their face to get their attention. They weren't even remotely apologetic"}
{"text":"So, it's not fair when I review this place because I was the Guest of Honor at a convention and they took me here.   And it was GOOOOOD!!!!!  The dinner was arranged, so there was no ordering, but the start was Peking Duck, which was spectacular, and then a diced duck that was amazing. I loved the pancakes that came with the duck. The abalone was unexpected, and while a bit chewy was BIG flavor! I enjoyed the Crab Rangoon-y thing (there was no menu I saw, so I am guessing at a few names) and the Tea-smoked chicken was the ideal! The dessert, a sesame ball, was amazing, far better than the Red Bean Paste versions that I love in the Bay Area.   Great stuff, and the next time in Toronto I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"We went to Dim Sum King seafood restaurant for Saturday dim sum. The restaurant is on the third floor, but luckily there is an elevator. The restaurant decor is old fashioned, but the restaurant is clean and the staff is attentive. The restaurant was crowded and very noisy.  We were seated close to the kitchen so we didn't have to wait for food. We ate the regular dim sum dishes like shui mai and Har gow. I thought that the food was very good, but my mother thought that it was poor compared to other restaurants.  Would we go back? Probably as there isn't many dim sum restaurants in Chinatown anymore."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the sketchy exterior building. Upon climbing a couple flights of stairs or taking the shoddy lift up to the third floor, you'll be greeted by the hustle and bustle of a surprisingly large Chinese restaurant, home to what's likely west chinatown's best dim sum.   My grandma and I dropped by around 1pm today and the dim sum carts were in full swing. The place was packed, but they have an impressive amount of tables, so we didn't have to wait. I'm fairly certain the owner has some sort of agreement with travel agencies, because you can often see whole busloads of tourists marching up here for afternoon tea. Either that, or maybe they just have good taste.   Selection, value, and flavour are all spot on. We even got surprisingly warm service for a dim sum joint, but maybe that's because my gma's a cutie, your results may vary. Dim Sum King has awesome \"early\" dim sum specials too. I use quotations because the last time I checked, everything except xl and above items are $2.80 until 4pm Mon - Fri, and until 11am on weekends. Skip the other dozens of dim sum places on Spadina, this is where the peeps in the know go."}
{"text":"Friendliest Chinese folks in the restaurant business I have ever met. Decent food but bathroom def needs cleaning ... like extensively (it was so bad I skipped!). Otherwise, fun spot for a quick dim sum. I would rec'd everything that I posted to eat except the squids."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for brunch. This was really good dim sum. The shrimp and vegetable dumpling was to die for. The food tasted great, the service was quick and friendly, and best of all, it was really reasonably priced. This was a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Toronto from the United States and decided to dine here. I've been to so many dim sum restaurants at various Chinatowns around the world, and I can say that the service here was terrible and the food was subpar. I don't expect much from restaurants in any Chinatown, but this was probably one of my most disappointing dim sum experiences.   This place was packed on a Saturday morning, but there were maybe 2-3 dim sum carts circulating at a time. The wait time to get food was very long. At one point, one of the carts came out of the kitchen and people got up from their seats to retrieve food from the cart, because that was the only way you'd actually get food. Eventually, we got things like steamed and fried dumplings, shumai, chicken feet, and tripe. Everything tasted average, and nothing really stood out.   We were here for much longer than we should've been. Yes, it was busy but it would be more understandable if there had actually been more dim sum carts circulating. We'll probably try a different restaurant next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"We arrived Sunday at 1 pm; although another reviewer suggested this would be an okay arrival time, it appears to have been too late.  We were seated at a rickety table (althuogh the place was only about 1/3 full); when we asked to be moved, we were ignored. When we made a move to move, an employee shooed us back to our table. While this wasn't a great way to start, we had read good things about the restaurant and figured we should give it a whirl.  There were very few carts coming around...we ordered some drinks. They never came. Tea was provided. I have no idea what kind it was, but it was good.  We started with an order of octopus tentacles. While the flavour was very good, they were cold[ish] with a pool of coagulating grease on the doily. We ate them anyhow as it was about 15 minutes until something we wanted to eat came by (this is when hot sauce comes in handy.)  The har gao was filled with decent shrimp (not fresh and flavourful but at least plentiful), but the wrappers were mushy and fell apart as soon as we picked them up. Meh.   Nothing else we wanted rolled by, so we asked for a menu and ordered 8 dishes from the dim sum menu. The shrimp and chive dumplings came almost right away. Lukewarm, almost cold. Again with the hot sauce. Now quite hungry, we ate them anyhow (we figured it would be weird for the four of us to send half a dumpling back.)  Some really excellent pea shoots/greens made their way to our table. No garlic, but delicious and fairly fresh, albeit a bit watery. This was the high point of the meal.  We got two shrimp rice rolls (although we ordered one shrimp and one pork.) Again, hungry, so we ate them. The rice roll was the thickest and doughiest roll I had ever eaten. I don' t consider this to be a good thing, but one of us quite enjoyed it.  The other 5 dishes never came. We asked after them once, then gave up, figuring it was time to get out,Our service was unobtrusive, to say the least. It was only when we asked for the bill that anyone bothered to ask us how anything was. When we noted that we were still missing 5 dishes, the waitress apologized, and told us next time she hoped our service would be better. Another person (manager?) came by to ask us how our food was. We reiterated our concern, and she told us the same thing, suggesting that maybe next time we should come earlier. Rest assured there will not be a 'next time'.  Dreadful, and very disappointing in light of some of the good reviews I read here and on another food site. But we only spent 35 bucks for the 4 of us, and were kind of full by the end, so at least there was no insult to injury.  You can do much better in Chinatown than this (Rol San and Noble both being far more consistant), unless ours was an unusually off day both food and service-wise. Somehow, I doubt it."}
{"text":"The review is for their Dim Sum. On a Sunday afternoon you don't have to wait long for a table. That is a sign to stay away! The food comes a la carte for Dim Sum which is super fun because you get to see the dishes and not try to figure out the translation. However, the problem with their a la carte is they rotate the same dishes over and over again. Rarely will you see new dishes coming out. It is also cold! If you want a specific dish you may have to flag a server and special order it. I was not impress with the taste of the dishes. Unfortunately if you are limited to downtown Spadina, Rol San is your best bet for descent dim sum. However, if you can....make a trip to Markham! So far all the restaurants I have been to up there are better than downtown Toronto. Don't waste your time at Dim Sum King."}
{"text":"Not very good food with slow service.  How on earth is a dim sum place always running out of shrimp dumplings... no soy sauce n chilly oil... shameful..."}
{"text":"This was my first ever dim sum experience and I loved ittt. It's a very wide restaurant with plenty of options.  The employees drive carts of different foods such as shu mai, dumplings, rice noodles, etc. around to customers' tables and offer you some. It's not very expensive, they have a lot to offer, and the food was delicious. We kept getting more of the shrimp and pork dumplings because they were that good.  You get full pretty quickly without even realizing it!  I'm giving a 4/5 because towards the end of our visit, we didn't get acknowledged as much.  The food was still very delicious."}
{"text":"Good price good dimsum  five stars for the price and the eggtarts  will definitely come again : )"}
{"text":"Very fresh shrimp!  Excellent and great value.  The traditional cart service is a big plus."}
{"text":"Food is ok (not as good as Rol San), but literally every single time we come here, we get ripped off. I am 99% certain they adding things to our tab that we didn't have and overcharging us for things we did have. I came here recently during lunch to try the \"all dim sum for $2.80\" daytime special. Because it took so long to get a menu (servers are overworked and will often ignore you if you are alone and/or don't speak Chinese) I became super hungry and just took the first thing I was offered off a trolley. Guess what my bill was for one TsingTao beer and one item of dim sum (five pieces of shrimp paste in chili pepper)? Almost $14. Unbelievable. $6 for a TsingTao is a joke when they cost $1.70 at the LCBO, even for Toronto where booze markups are ridiculous. And mysteriously, the one dish I ordered was considered to be \"Extra Large\" (even though it was barely the size of a small appetizer) so it was \"exempt\" from the $2.80 deal and I was charged full price. For the same amount of money, at Pho Hung just up the road on Spadina Ave, $14 gets you a huge bowl of noodle soup, a beer, AND spring rolls. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Every dish we tried was excellent! However, when the place gets busy at lunch time a lot of the dishes are nowhere to be found however as soon as the restaurant became less busy suddenly many more dishes started to trickle down to our area. It would seem that the key to having a positive experience here is location location location the shrimp dumplings were our favorite"}
{"text":"This dim sum spot rivals those in New York but with a much shorter wait ! The people who worked here were all very pleasant. We had a variety of dishes : steamed and baked pork buns, Chinese broccoli, pork and shrimp dumplings, vegetable dumplings, beef in rice wrap, and many many more things ! All tasted very good and were hot and fresh !   I was very satisfied and left very full ! Can't wait to visit again !"}
{"text":"This place is getting the 4 star upgrade! It's my new go-to place for dim sum downtown.   I've been 4-5 times now and the dim sum is consistently good. Much better than Rol San. I do recommend going in the evening though. They have all day dim sum, but it's the push cart ladies if you go in the morning/brunch time. When you go in the evening everything comes fresh from the kitchen, as most of the other diners are ordering from the regular menu.  (I cannot believe the review of this place saying the dim sum is from frozen dumplings...NO! I swear...it's obviously not)   Some of my favourite dim sum here are:  - The har gow (very thin skins, delicious) - The chicken and vegetable dumplings (definitely home made, lots of herbs, veggies and chicken inside) - The honey-lemon glazed short ribs (SO good...no fatty/gristly meat like at Rol San) - The pan fried chives cakes (Must try! They are 3 small round disks filled with chives and whole shrimps. Not a big pancake like you imagine) - Fried eggplant (very good here - stuffed with a shrimp filling, not overly greasy)  Prices are reasonable, the bill usually comes to $20-$23 including tax for 6 dim sum dishes (feast for 2 people)  The service here is great, really attentive. One time I even had a guy who was fluent in English serve me but normally you get people with only passable English.   The other food looks delicious. I saw some people eating big plates of crab last night and it really reminded me of a place in San Francisco I went to, so I might have to go try that out.  They also have really nice bathrooms. And on Friday nights, they have \"dancing\" with a DJ and dance floor set up and Asian couples doing ballroom and line dancing, which I found quite hilarious.  My only very slight moan is that they do not have my favourite spicy chili oil sauce. You have to ask for the sauces and you get a normal dish of chili sauce, but it's not the oily one. Boo."}
{"text":"Visiting from the states. Came here with my cousin and aunt. Always love a good dim sum!"}
{"text":"Three-star for the food, but one added star for the wide variety and cheap price.  Every dimsum item you can ever dream of is available here - which makes this place very very authentic. Unfortunately, the slowness of the push carts and the lack of changes in their route rendered us mostly foodless and impatient. At the end we just called one of the hosts over and ordered it.  It seems like there are more food available after 1pm for dimsum than at 11am...  We ordered about 12 dishes and the total was approximately $50 for four people, which is incredibly cheap since we were all really full.  The place is full of old Asian people--like 70s and 80s, so you know you have entered a real hk dimsum restaurant."}
{"text":"I love dim sum, so if a city has a china town this is my first stop. So, this was a first meal in Toronto.   Although it seems very busy, they are very good about seating you quickly. However, the seat we got was somewhat out of the way from most of the carts. Therefore, the service was not very good. While I normally like to sample many plates and have some variety, we could only get a small plate at a time and wait 15 or 20 minutes for the next small plate to pass.   Everything we got was good, but I wish there was more variety. All our plates had no meat or shrimp, which I guess I should have predicted based on the name of the restaurant. I was missing some por dumplings though.   My boyfriend was happy with this place because of its authentic vibe. This is not for people who have never tried dim sum before, it might be overwhelming. You definitely have dim sum for more of an interactive dining environment less so than a relaxing one, and this was true for dim sum king.   The restaurant was good, but I would try somewhere else before coming back here again."}
{"text":"9/10 | I don't often go downtown for Chinese food since it's always so busy, but I saw that it was cart service in Chinatown and my friend and I wanted to eat fast before getting a train. Service was quick and efficient this morning (10:45am) and it wasn't too busy. There was a medium sized variety coming out but it was all the good stuff like pork buns and egg tarts and beef ribs. For morning service midweek, there was at least 15 different options being rolled around including congee, chicken feet, dumplings (shrimp and other), beef balls, tofu etc. - so not too shabby. Food tasted pretty okay too (y).   It was a great time to go since we finished in 35 minutes including paying for the bill.*  I switched between Cantonese and English, and staff weren't giving us worse service because of it. This is *really* important to me as I usually bring non-Asian friends and sometimes traditional places can be quite rude. Brownie points for them!  --  DIm Sum King is just upstairs in the plaza it's in, and it is close to 2 Green P's nearby if you're driving and really easy to get to on the Spadina streetcars.    *In dim sum places it usually takes 1 hour min. to get through everything from my experiences so WOW."}
{"text":"Cold food, extremely slow service, and below average food (we were there from 10am till 11am on a Saturday). All their shrimps were so hard and unflavourful, they probably kept reheating since nobody liked their shrimp dishes. We had 5 plates between two of us, very unsatisfied with every single dish and paid $25. I'd rather pay more and have better dim sum elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum food was amazing. Service was initially bad because our server didn't speak English which made it difficult to figure out how to order and how much to order but once they swapped servers and we got Tommy the experience was much better. In general I am not a fan of Chinese food but I have to say I was impressed by this place. There was not one thing I didn't like and even though I over ate I honestly didn't feel bloated afterwards. It felt like good Chinese home cooking."}
{"text":"They are definitely not the best dim sum place I've been to but it does the job since there are very few dimsum restaurants downtown. This establishment has been in Chinatown for years- having several name changes but the managers and workers are always the same. Hmm. Food is decent, you can always count on the usual suspects being good hargow, siumai, beef rice rolls, chicken feet and steamed tofu dessert. You always have to ask for hot sauce and flagging someone down isn't easy, even if you speak Chinese. There are indeed better dimsum places uptown but if you're downtown and craving, this place does just fine!"}
{"text":"Went here with some locals and they said this was the best dim sum spot in the area. Place was packed on a Sunday afternoon. Our party of 15 got seated in minutes.  Food came out really quickly. Everything was really hot in temperature, dishes were seasoned well and the staff was very accommodating. They serve the typical dim sum dishes. We did notice the pepper steak, chicken feet and shrimp balls were very large in portion. Shumai and har gow tasted really fresh unlike the frozen dim sum spots you find elsewhere.  They have a really good system going with the rotation of dishes coming around so you don't see the same dish multiple times. Staff is very attentive in re filling your drinks and cleaning your table. The older waitress we had was great in taking care of us and allowing our group to order a la carte. If you're craving some dim sum in the area this is the spot.  Location is very clean, staff is great and dim sum here is really good. There is plenty of street parking. They have seating for parties from 2-12. Everyone in our party left happy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday and we thought it was great. We don't eat chicken, beef or pork, but had NO problem getting veggies or shrimp only. The food carts were by right away and frequent.  Loved the large variety of shrimp options, the noodles and the tea. Service was quick, friendly with no problem understanding what each dish was in English. We had 5 shrimp dishes, noodles, red bean buns and tea for less than $35."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Peking duck was awesome and I love their service. We had our MID AUTUM FESTIVAL here."}
{"text":"Lip stick on my water glass, waited for 30 minutes for a spare ribs so I cancelled it. The worst service ever."}
{"text":"Located on the south side of the Dundas St strip in Chinatown, this place has undergone several name changes over the past few decades.   Place is pretty clean. Haven't seen any bugs so far and that's a good sign.   Whether you are coming here for lunch or dinner, the food is consistently good.   For dinner, the fresh fish and lobster is good.   If you love dim sum, it's available all day. The food can be order or via the traditional dim sum cart where the ladies generally don't speak English.   Service is usually quick unless you get caught behind a bunch of people from a tour."}
{"text":"Old-school dim sum house, delighted to see the tea cart service and large variety of dim sum.   (We went on a Sunday morning for brunch -- I noted that some reviewers did not experience the cart service, so it may be only on weekends when the crowds are bigger.)  In general, their dim sum had very good flavors, bright and distinct.  Some notable ones in our opinion: the roast duck (nice crisp skin, and happily, not fatty or greasy at all); steamed beef spare ribs (very good, redolent with black bean sauce, succulent and tender); fried whole shrimp (very crispy, willingly able to eat shell, tail and all); and the shrimp-stuffed eggplant with black bean sauce.  Items worthy of a shout-out: DSKSR's pan-fried shrimp-chive dumplings (excellent flavor -- had several rounds of those!);  steamed pork buns (one of the best I've had in a while, soft and pillowy, with a pork filling that was not too sweet or cloying); and another repeat rounder in their shrimp-stuffed jalapeno peppers (quite tasty and nice heat).  On the downside, their salt&pepper squid was not as good as I would have expected; and we seemed to keep seeing the same carts over and over again.  We had to be patient to wait for the right cart with the dim sum that we wanted."}
{"text":"My sister and two cousins decided to stop here for dim sum. It's okay overall.   Good ~ got seated fairly quick; no waiting time when we went at 11 am. ~ food came by via carts often but lacking in selections.  Bad ~ very few selections, mostly shu mai came by. ~ very elderly (retirement age) nonspeaking ladies came by with carts; appeared annoyed when ask them to show what's in the bamboo containers since they don't speak English to describe them. ~ very unfriendly staff who barks \"what you want?\" when trying to ask if we can get vegetables. ~ spent 60 CAD for four people and we didn't eat that much. ~ tea pot looks unclean for ages.  ~ can't get a constant waiter to help you. You had to hail a walking server to tell them what you need and hope they remember.  Just like any Asian restaurants in ANY city, do not expect high level of customer service. Just hope that they understand what you're asking for."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight food was amazing service was great nice people only thing was me and my boyfriend were the only ones there so it had a \"the shinning \" feel to it but none the less a good time and good food!"}
{"text":"They took the salt shaker from my table and placed it on someone elses and didnt ask me wtf ??"}
{"text":"Best dim sum I've had since NYC. We went around 1 so I wasn't sure if they would still have the traditional carts. They did, which was good and bad. We tried some fantastic things but you run the risk of not getting your favorites. We weren't too hungry, so we shared just 4 plates. We were seated right away and served jasmine tea. The carts came quickly and the servers were nice about telling you what everything is (as long as you can understand their accents, which I am not so good at!) There wasn't much variety and the same things kept coming around, but we liked everything they had. Overall we got almost everything I wanted (har how, shiu mai, potstickers), but I noticed the seasoned lady next to me had an orange menu that she ordered off of. Wish we had done that!   Overall it was delicious, clean, easy to find (on the 3rd floor), and cheap (only $20)."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning right at when they opened. They food is typical of what you get at a dim sum place. They have almost everything you'd expect though they were out of hargow the day I went. They still use the trolleys which took a bit of time to get around especially when it's earlier in the morning. I would've given this place 3 or 4 stars if it had not been the service. The staff just spoke at us in Cantonese, which we didn't speak. When we asked questions in English, one of the staff was visibly annoyed and spoke some words in Cantonese and left."}
{"text":"Very average.  The prices were not as cheap as what I had expected.  I thought the Shanghai noodles were very uninspired.  The variety was very average, and the building very worn.  On my next trip to Toronto I wil try another dim sum house.  I like the small town feel,"}
{"text":"All day dim sum is available here, which is what our party came for. They didn't have carts pushing (we came at dinner time, so no surprise there). Food was decent, tasted some MSG in there but that's not new for asian restaurants. The deep fried stuff was good though, no weird lingering oily taste afterwards. Service was really fast considering the place was quite busy when we got there. They also accommodated all of us splitting the bill and using the debit/credit machine (not all asian places are happy about this)."}
{"text":"Everything was very good! Traditional cart service and very busy location. Would recommend if your in the downtown Chinatown area."}
{"text":"One of the better dim joints in Chinatown. It's located on the third floor of the building. Pretty large place that accommodates quite a lot of tables so there's not a huge wait time. Pretty much got seated after a 15 minute wait for a table of 7 on a Sunday.  It's also fairly clean though I'd still wipe my plating and utensils before eating. Service is ok - what you usually get at these Chinese places lol.  Onto the food, pretty decent for the price you're paying! I mean for me, it's a much better option for my wallet than going to Rol San. No food that really stocks out as amazing though. It's also your traditional method of wheeling carts around for your food and compared to other places that still do this, these dim sum ladies actually come around quite often! So not to worry if you miss a cart, she'll come back in 10 mins again.   So if you're looking for some traditional dim sum in the heart of Chinatown, this would be one of your better options!"}
{"text":"I am often worried about checking out a dim sum place as environment is fast paced and I'm not very familiar with how to order. I visited during dinner time, there were no one pushing carts but instead, we ordered on paper. The staffs were super friendly and helpful. Food was delicious! They price you based on whether food was small, medium, large or extra large. I believe price was $3 for small, $4 for medium, and $5 for large (but don't take this 100% since I only got a glimpse at my hill so not quite sure). Anyways, dim sum was delicious and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Came back since I had a craving for zongzi, which is listed on the menu as \"steam sticky rice pouch with salted meat\". It was $6 for one but definitely worth it. The server unwrapped it and cut it for us!  I also tried the chicken feet, they were great.   Noticed that tea costs $2 here, but prices are cheap. There's also a discount if you come between 9-4pm."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!!!!  The portions are big, and they don't cheap out on the meat!  I love it!  There are huge selections to choose from, something as exotic as Oysters all the way to the traditional hargow and siu mai.  I also love how they are one of the few restaurants left to bring dim sum around the tables in push carts.  I really am all about preserving tradition! The restaurant is pretty big, and both times I have been here I didn't have to wait in line.  The servers are pretty busy so you have to flag them down.  But once you do, they are quick to comply to your requests.   I definitely will come here again for dim sum."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Understated, delicious dim sum for good value  Came here for lunch Saturday. 5 minute wait at 1:30 pm.   ------------ Detailed review:  Turnip cake: mushy, too dense, not crispy.   Pork ribs: delicious, beautifully seasoned with garlic and fermented black beans and chilli. Juicy and tender.   Curried cuttlefish: rich in flavour, a little on the sweet side but still solid dish.   Fried tentacles: more oily, not crispy enough. But still lives up to expectations  Sticky rice wrapped in leafs: simple, authentic, delicious  Siu mai (pork dumpling): juicy, tender, nothing special just satisfying.   Ha gao (shrimp dumpling): average, nothing special but very satisfying.   ------------ Highlights: pork ribs, sticky rice Lowlights: turnip cake Length of meal: 45 minutes Final thoughts: for the price point, this is delicious food, restaurant is always packed.  Would we return? Yes, second time here"}
{"text":"Very greasy and not as good as Rol San. I'm still giving this place a 4 stars though because it still blows any shitty NYC dim sum joint out of the water. For the most part it's a lot of the same dishes...but it's just done so much damn better. Toronto has high standards for Asian food. Clearly."}
{"text":"This place was ok. A lot of people recommended it to me, but I've had better in Richmond Hill. The service was pretty bad, but I guess that's on par for dim sum restaurants. The food didn't seem totally fresh. The chicken feet was pretty good though. I'll try it again maybe."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for dim sum.  It's a big busy place with carts and all the great standards of a Dim Sum restaurant.  The ladies driving the carts are very helpful and will steer you towards the chickens feet or other dumpling specialty.  We have been multiple times (with a child) and the experience and food have been excellent."}
{"text":"Not bad for dim sum the prices are a little high compared to what I'm use to paying in NYC but overall not bad. The food is fresh and it's not crowded. Worth checking out if you just feel like eating dim sum and not driving anywhere far."}
{"text":"I found this Dim Sum restaurant pretty ordinary and not very tasty. The dumplings were probably the best dishes, but the shrimp we got was tasteless, the pork was incredibly dry. Beef tips were also quite tasteless. Definitely not my favourite dim sum joint. This place is definitely nothing compared to Noble Seafood Restaurant which I feel has the best dim sum in the city."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum places in the gta. Better then Ginger and onion at Pacific Mall. Very good and very reasonable. Good is always fresh, service is great, love having carts. This place is always packed. Order the shrimp roll, the egg tarts are great as well."}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum joint in Toronto, but definitely a lot better than the other ones in Chinatown. The dishes will pass through the tables on carts so you can just point at something you want and they'll bring it to your table. Definitely get the usual dishes like Har Gow or shrimp rice rolls, and if you haven't already, try the chicken feet and the deep fried pork dumplings. One of the dishes came to our table pretty cold which was slightly disappointing. Overall, one of the better dim sum places in the area but if you don't mind a little drive I would recommend any dim sum restaurant in Scarborough instead.  Also, don't come around lunch time on a weekend as the waiting time will be quite lengthy!"}
