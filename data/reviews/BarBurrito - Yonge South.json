{"text":"Awful. Worst burritos anywhere. Cheap interior. Spent all their money on Yonge st. Frontage and nothing on interior or food quality. Save yourself grief."}
{"text":"First time trying here and initially was pretty excited.  However I think it's just alright - nothing fancy.  Ordered a quesadilla which was a bit soggy and 2 orders of taco that barely had any filling! Also ordered chips and the cashier charged me for queso without asking or telling me. Then I had to remind them to pack it- even more disappointing was it tasted horribly (possibly spoilt).  Overall I think it could be a hit or miss. Won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"After having just finished a conversation with a friend about the best toppings for tacos, I decided I needed to have a burrito for dinner.  
Being new to my neighbourhood and having noticed BarBurrito a couple weeks ago I figured I'd give it a try.  Here is a run down of my experience:
I got in line, almost left because the counter area looked a bit dark and the server looked a bit frazzled.  I stayed because she greeted me with a very friendly smile and 'what can i get you'.  I ordered a regular sized chicken burrito and handed over just under $8 for it.  My hesitation continued as I saw some sort of mashed up bean spread be slathered on the wrap, instead of actual beans.  My hesitation turned into really low expectations when the guacamole (which I guess they deserve acknowledgement that the guac is included in the price) came out of a mustard squeeze bottle.  
I then took my order to go and ate it at home.  
The verdict wasn't good.  It was a bit tasteless, no real heat despite it having jalepenos in it, and the chicken I think was actually ground chicken not chicken breast, that or I'm not really sure what sort of meat I was eating.  Needless to say, I wont be returning.  I'll stick to Chipotle and Quesada."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have ever had in a long time.
One of my new favorite pit stops before or after a club"}
{"text":"I had 2-3 fairly average, bordering on disappointing burritos before my last burrito where I got a sausage wrapper in my beef burrito.  I have no idea how or why this was in my burrito but was really gross...

The sign and the eating area look fairly clean but one look at the clustered food prep area and you can where there might be issues with this restaurant.  I'd recommend avoiding it..."}
{"text":"Ordered last night and forgot half the order. Everything was freezing, burritos can missing ingredients. When called to complain about missing things was passed around from person to person. Was then hung up on. Justeat called and the restaurant didn't pick up for a while. Finally got then to send other items and it took nearly an hour, far beyond what the first order took. Terrible service, food was not great, just an overall terrible experience."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm a fan. Once in a while when the perfect storm emerges (i.e. I'm super hungry, in a hurry, and not on a diet), I find myself here. They have a tasty sweet potato substitute for beans, and generally the ingredients taste good. The people that work here are nice and friendly, and there is always great salsa music blaring which you can hear in the street... a nice touch of warmth to the usual bland and dull face in this area of Bay street."}
{"text":"This is not somewhere that I plan on returning to. I had the taco salad some time ago, and honestly can't remember it much, but I'm assuming it was ok since I don't remember it being horrible. 
Today I had the fish tacos. Not so great. The fish itself was ok, I've had much better. What was wrong is the fact that it advertises as having coleslaw. Last I remember, coleslaw is cabbage. I had some gigantic chunks of lettuce and a little peices of tomatoe? Nope, no coleslaw to be found. My coworker opted for a snack, and went with the nachos and guac. How can you screw that up you ask? Very easy, start with store bought stale nacho chips and throw in a container of store bought very plastic tasting guac and you're good!
Honestly, it's not hard to buy fresh ingredients, especially with all the fresh markets in the direct vicinity of this store. 
With places like Burrito Banditos and Chino Locos, right around the corner, these guys need to step it up a notch."}
{"text":"BarBurrito is a great place for a quick take-out burrito for a low cost.

I typically get the Chicken Burrito with all the extra toppings which comes to $7.90 with tax and it is consistently very good.
 
Pros:
-Ingredients are always fresh and burrito tastes great.
-Never have to wait more than a couple minutes for food to be prepared
-All the staff are very friendly.
-Nice small patio in the back

Also they have a deal where if you sign up for their wifi you get a free can of pop."}
{"text":"In terms of burritos, this restaurant is pretty average. It turns into one big, soggy mess, but it's still pretty tasty. The portion sizes are generous and the flavours are decent though. I asked for it to be spicy, and it was still pretty tame, so don't expect anything hot.

The service is quick and very friendly.

This gets three stars for the great little patio out back. For a restaurant just off of Yonge, it's very quiet back there."}
{"text":"Had their lunch feature burrito of the day, a ground beef one.  Can't say I'm going to remember this after I click post, but for $5 it was tasty enough.

It's a log of food..

Value wise it'll be tough to beat."}
{"text":"Loved the Extreme Fries!!!! This was like The Works at Taco Bell but 10000 better quality. They even had a vegetarian minced beef option. It tasted amazing. 

Reason for my four stars: Washrooms were incredibly dirty."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the very low rating on here for these guys but then it came to my knowledge that it's under new management and/or ownership now and I had a great experience here. 
I went with a couple of friends who were regulars and the guy behind the counter was very excited to see that they had brought a new customer in with them. He was all full of suggestions for what I could get, but since I felt like being a vegetarian that day I went with their soy option with \"the works\" jalapenos and hot sauce all dumped in there to make a monster of a burrito. 

They have a nice small patio (very reminicsent of Ravi Soup), a good selection of Mexican pop bottles (highly recommend you grab one of these for your meal) and my burrito was more than enough to satisfy my hunger and it was very yummy and juicy! 

So if you are hungry and want a well priced meal do not hesitate to walk in here!"}
{"text":"Average Tex-Mex location located in downtown Toronto's core area. Under new management since the fall of 2011, this location has a nice selection of specialty burritos and tacos that caters to all tastes. Convenient location near the corner of Yonge and Wellesley streets makes it an ideal spot for anyone to get a bite to eat. Food quality surpasses that found at Hernado's Hideaway (across the street) and Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Sorry guys. But I have been here twice and left disappointed both times. I get the naked burrito without the flour bowl. And both the chicken and the pulled pork are flavourless. And they fill the bowl with a lot of lettuce. I don't usually turn my nose up at lettuce. But it was flaccid and as I'm sure you're aware not a big flavour boost to the dish. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Me and the BF went here just after they opened. Looked like they were still finishing up a few renos but its cute. The guy that made our burritos was so nice and the lady was super nice as well. She gave me free extra salsa and sour cream. We paid waay to much for our 2 meals though. It some how came to almost 30 bucks. we got burritos drinks and side of fries. I was satisfied with the burrito because it was well made, but because it was overpriced I probably wont go back unless its my last resort. 

If you want a good Burrito, go to Burrito Boys (see my review)"}
{"text":"Fish burrito was tasty and price was right but got some severe stomach ache half hour later. Would not go here again."}
{"text":"Given the wealth of mexican food in this area, I won't be returning to Barburrito. I ordered a standard ground beef burrito. It was mostly rice and that rice was undercooked. I love burritos but stopped eating this one about halfway through."}
{"text":"From the exterior the restaurant looks fine, but a completely different experience as soon as you step inside. Lights were dim, tables looked unsanitary. Despite the atmosphere, I placed my order for 3 chicken tacos. Came to a price of $7.50, definitely on the higher price for tacos. Based on the price I would have expected a bit more, but as they were making the tacos in front of me.

Taco shells were generic from a bag and reheated on the heat pan. The vegetables looked old and out of a bag. The lettuce was dry and discolored. Tomatoes were soggy. Chicken was precooked and may have been over re-heated making them dry. Overall taco experience wasn't the greatest. After finishing the tacos, I was worried for my health. Thankfully I didn't end up with any stomach problems. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Mexican with an Indian Twist.

My local Wellesley friend clued me in on an unlisted item at this particular BarBurrito.  It's their Butter Chicken burrito.  The owner here is South Asian and somehow gets away with deviating from the standard franchised menu.  He also serves samosas.

I ordered a regular ($7, and comes with a free bottle of Nestle water), and asked them not to make it anymore spicy.  It was already pretty spicy to begin with.  It was an interesting combo, eating traditional Indian Buttery Chicken with beans, lettuce, and dressing, wrapped inside a whole wheat wrap.

Even though I ordered a regular, it was still a monstrocity of a burrito.  I hear the large is the same size, but with double the meat.  Somehow I managed to eat the entire thing.  It was okay, but I wouldn't need to try it again."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!

I didn't think it was possible to totally screw up a burrito, but Barburrito has managed to do it.

In other burrito reviews I've said I could probably wrap dog food in a tortilla and it would taste better. I was wrong.  The burrito I had here probably was dog food wrapped in a tortilla and it tasted awful. I supposedly had the steak burrito but I'm really not sure what meat was in it because it sure didn't look like steak. The burrito was a pile of tasteless mush with some lettuce on top.

Which brings me to my next point.  And this goes for all burrito places, not just Barburrito. STOP PUTTING LETTUCE IN A BURRITO IF YOU'RE GOING TO GRILL IT. Who wants warm lettuce?

As for the rest of the restaurant, the place was clean. The staff were clearly new as it seemed like it was the blind leading the blind with the new guy being trained by the somewhat less new guy (maybe this explains my tortilla wrapped turd). There are a few tables to sit at, but you probably won't because you'll be running for the door once you take one bite of your burrito.

The one positive thing I can say is that the extreme fries are pretty good. Better than the Taco Bell equivalent."}
{"text":"Had the chorizo burrito and was really disappointed. Ingredients not very fresh, and the chorizo was slices of sausage."}
{"text":"The tacos make up in flavour for those weary of 3 for $8 with tax. The beef is delicious and has lovely spices, steak is chewy and juicy, and chicken is just good ol' chicken. Get at least one beef taco in a crispy shell (despite it being El Paso it seems...unsure)"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here. I love it. 

the staff are nice, and the burritos are massive! I usually share one with my boyfriend, but since becoming a vegetarian, I can't share most things with him anymore. I had the cheese and bean burrito last time -- It was so stuffed it was splitting at the seams. I couldn't finish it. But it was tasty nonetheless. 

Their tacos from what I remember are not worth it. They are very small and expensive for what you get. -- Stick with the burritos (the safe bet)"}
