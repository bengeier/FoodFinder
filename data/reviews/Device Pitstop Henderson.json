{"text":"A few weeks ago I paid $60 to have a broken glass screen replaced for my iPhone 5s .  Yesterday I had the phone in my back pocket and sat on it to the point where a minor crack once again developed on a small part of the top of my screen.  I took my phone back in and asked them to replace the screen , and honor their 30 day service warranty , but they refused and wanted another $40 for another repair! My experience with device pit stop has led me to question the quality of their screens .  I really did not put much pressure on my phone at all, my phone had a case on it, and the crack was minor but they still refused to honor their 30 day service warranty. I've decided to take my phone to Apple and pay the full $100 ($60 more) to make sure the repair is done right with high quality materials ."}
{"text":"Took my daughters computer to get a much need check up and repair and they were great and price was spot on.  It only took them a couple days and the computer has been working great since.  Will definitely us again if."}
{"text":"excellent customer service.  clean store found exactly what I wanted.  thanks guys! best prices"}
{"text":"As a small business owner I'm always running into problems with my computers. I have six employees that each have a laptop, and a tablet, and they all have issues. My office is on the other side of town and but I have no problem driving across town to have these guys work on everything. They're super efficient and honest about the issues. I never get upsold or bs'd, it's always straightforward and super fast. I can't say enough good things about them."}
{"text":"Went in for a simple replacement glass screen cover and installation along with a replacement battery. Everything went smoothly, though I did feel as if I was being rushed. They got the service done in the amount of time they said they would get in done in."}
{"text":"**** STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE***** I would never tell anyone to go here. They took on a job they should have never done. If you have any Apple products do not take them here and waste your money to only find out that now no one else will even touch it because they ruined it. Cheaper to buy a new one. Terrible absolutely terrible  RIP MacBook Retina Display !"}
{"text":"Okay, you have, Shaun, Michael, Rodrigo and the owner...ALL fabulous. They listen, they remember and they care. They are knowledgeable about PC's, laptops and Mac's, and a bunch of other, \"Stuff\". Go in, stop by, bring your problematic computer; they will help. They will ask questions, they will be fair and reasonable and they will include you in the decision process, as to how you would like to proceed!! My husband and I have been bringing our laptops to them for years and we're never disappointed. We refer the store to everybody!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Informative on the phone and in person. Had my computer fixed in less than 5 hours. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The reps that work there are absolute sweethearts! Rodrigo helped me with my nextbook and did not charge me because it only took him a couple seconds. They are honest and love to help. I would recommend this store to anyone!"}
{"text":"I went here for a computer and to have my iPad fixed. They were so cool and easy going. They listened to what I needed and they didn't over explain how they would fix it!  My device was ready on time and the computer I purchased worked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Your comment doesn't match what your employee was stating! Please advise your staff on what your claiming on my post. I wasn't the only customer who walked out and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"From my experience, this is the best repair shop i have been to. I come here because the crew, the price and the service is amazing. I came in here with a broken ipad mini and they only charged me $100, which is way cheaper than other repair shops that charge you about $200+. After 2-3 days they repaired it and made sure everything was in working order and that i was completely satisfied. This place definitely deserves a 5 star rating in my book"}
{"text":"Preferred this place before they became Device Pitstop...they used to have actual knowledgable staff who could troubleshoot serious problems. I went in the other day, 3+ staff members socializing instead of greeting customers. I was ignored for a good 2 minutes while they finished their conversation. Overpriced computers, and they sell those self-immolating balance boards. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"thanks for 100% excellent service you guys are simply the best.fix my HP Comuter and my  iphone 6  screen."}
{"text":"I took my laptop in to trade in for store credit toward a laptop for my boyfriend who needed one for work. I was under the impression that my computer was a lemon but Mike told me that I had a great laptop it just needed some work. After putting in at least 2 hours with us, my laptop still needs work but Mike's honesty about it being salvageable, instead of making a few hundred dollars off of us and getting my laptop too, was really great. I might still end up selling it if we can't fix it but my boyfriend and I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"They were very friendly and it went by very fast! My boyfriend's cracked screen was fixed in a little less than thirty minutes so at the time we just grabbed some food next door to kill time :)"}
{"text":"Shun's customer service game is strong.  However the stores overall customer service and professional organization execution could use smoothing on its rough edges. Check Amazon/prime/student prices before buying a computer here. It will help with your haggling and bargaining position.  Probably better to purchase  from amazon unless you have a computer or two for trade in."}
{"text":"Horrible service and such a run-around. Every one you need to talk to to resolve an issue is either not in today, no longer works there, or  there's no need in contacting cause they are an independent store. A battery purchase is kept in their computers but a warranty isn't? Give me a break! In all my years of buying and owning computers, I've never heard or experienced such malarkey. So long customer service!"}
{"text":"this place is wonderful - i have a Dell tablet that had issues- James checked me in super-fast and told me quickly what he thought the problem was.... sure enough it was fixed same-day and for a such a low price! - i was shocked but happy. My tablet works perfectly now. I highly recommend this repair shop - pleasant, fast and fair repair fees."}
{"text":"Do Not go here it is a rip off , cam in with Wifi issues payed $49 to fix it and got home and it wasn't even fixed!!! Then went to Target and got a USB adapter and problem solved , they literally could have just told me what to buy I went in there the first time!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Update....And now they're closed.....  Been there many times.  After they first opened, I was a fan.  Now that they are franchising and it appears this location might not have the same owners or personnel I first met, things have changed.  I needed a new battery for my iPhione 5s.  Price was good, service was fast.  The battery life really isn't any longer than the one I had replaced.  I couldn't even tell if it really was replaced.  You can usually tell that the phone has been opened.  With an iPhone, you pull the screen.  Didn't look like it was removed regardless how careful they were.  I went back in after the battery life didn't get any better.  They wouldn't budge on giving me a refund, so i I'll live with it.  I might go back in for stuff, but I'm not sure about anything else.  Otherwise, I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"Replaced my iPhone 6s screen and the force touch stopped working... they replaced it again for free, and a few pixels were dead... they replaced it again for free, with another OEM brand new display that also had a few pixels dead... they seem to have got a bad batch of screens.  The service quality was good though, and the 30 day warranty is a must!!!"}
