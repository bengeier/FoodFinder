{"text":"Horrible Service, never going back.   Went there last night with 5 other friends. As soon as we placed our order, the manager came down and asked us why we had ordered only 2 dishes. We had actually ordered 4. Then she came back and literally banged 5 plates on our table. The waitresses were not so bad. The food was of good quality and taste, a little heavy on the grease though. We had ordered a lamb dish, a Lo Mein, Rice Noodles, and Chicken corn soup. When the check came, they had added 18 percent gratuity but I did not notice and left a tip on top of it. She did not say anything, I saw her closely scanning my bill - it was obvious she was checking out the tip. I had to call her later and ask her to reverse the tip, which was obviously another bad experience."}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison a short time.  I constantly here there are not good Chinese restaurants.  BULL!!!  This place was a gem!  Most reviews rave about the food, but comment on service.  The manager kept coming by to offer any help in eating or ordering.  What a huge menu! They certainly tried to be responsive.  We tried the dumplings and spring rolls as appetizers, and both were different and fantastic.  They were well-prepared with a great blend of spices.  We got the dandan noodles, garlic pork, and cashew chicken for entrees.  All were delicious, fresh, and flavorful.  The garlic pork was the biggest hit!  We took a lot home, but the price was great for the quality and quantity.  My only regret is this glowing review, because I do not want them to get too busy, haha.  Seriously, it was very memorable!"}
{"text":"The Japanese name is a bit of a fooler, and kept me from visiting for a while.  It wasn't until I noted on the sign the Chinese characters for \"Sichuan\" that I realized what this place actually was.  What it is, is pretty danged good.  The menu isn't the standard American-chinese fare of sweet-and-sour or sesame meat.  While you can find a few entrees of the tamer variety (orange beef, for example) most of the menu is regional Sichuan and Hunan specialties.  The first item on the menu is a \"spicy ox tongue\" appetizer, so that should be enough to let you make an informed decision.  Much, but not all of the food is of the spicy kind.  There's a whole section of the menu devoted to dishes made with pickled chilies, and another one for the Sichuan classic \"boiled [meat] in spicy sauce.\"  Also available are the more hunan-style \"dry-braised\" dishes, as well as many other entrees sorted by protein.    The food is, put simply, good.  It's hearty, bold, filling, and generally well-prepared.  The cumin beef, one of my personal favorites, is spicy without being overpowering, and nicely redolent of cumin.  The \"boiled pork in  spicy sauce\" is well-prepared; this sort of dish can easily be made too greasy, seasoned improperly, or padded-out with cabbage, but on none of the occasions I've tried it has it been anything other than a well-balanced mix of chili, garlic, meat and vegetable in a rich, stew-like sauce.  The \"beef with ginger and scallion\" is rich, not spicy, and full of garlic and ginger.  The Dan Dan noodle appetizer is a simple bowl of noodles with a rich sauce of ground pork, chilis, scallion and garlic that is quite satisfying as an appetizer, and is nearly a meal in itself.  The only strangeness with the preparations is the surprisingly low incidence of Sichuan pepper.  The dishes are good without it, but their seasoning leans more towards the Hunan than the Sichuan without the numbing fruitiness of the little flower peppers.     The translations on the menu may be a little confusing for some with their literal interpretations - ordering a \"braised vegetable\" dish doesn't immediately inform you that it is a single braised vegetable (bok choi, which admittedly is a classic braised vegetable dish), and the Tofu with Black Mushroom is simply lots of tofu with a few slices of black mushroom.    The service has generally been good, albeit not great.  A few times they've forgotten to bring beverages or misinterpreted an order.  Never anything major, they've always accepted their errors, and I've never had an actual bad experience, but it is an area that needs a bit of improvement."}
{"text":"This is amazingly delicious Chinese food.  Don't be afraid to try anything-everything we have had is amazing.  And things to try there are--a huge menu with many items rarely offered in Madison--pork kidneys, chicken feet, frog legs and the like.  Cold eggplant appetizer amazing, the braised rabbit was wonderful.  This food is seriously good stuff!"}
{"text":"I've only had the food from here once and it was delivery.  I like how delivery is online, that is great for me.  The green beans with garlic that I heard so much about was good but they were ice cold (on purpose).  I didn't dig that so much.  The flavor was good though, a little greasy but good.  The general tso's chicken was super good and I felt good after eating it.  It's okay.  I would consider eating there again in house since I hear so many good things about it."}
{"text":"I have been to Ichiban more than 10 times since it first opened ~ 2 years ago. When I first heard of their name, I thought it's a Japanese restaurant. But make no mistake, Ichiban serves up authentic Sze Chuan food. Their menu and taste are actually pretty similar to Fugu, but since Ichiban opened I frequent Ichiban so much more because parking is so much easier right in front of the restaurant itself or along one of the streets nearby (free in the evenings and weekends!).   I have tried (and recommend) their spicy fish dishes. There are a couple of those in the menu. Together with the hot pot series (kidneys, intestines, fish and lamb). The claypot beef is a good dish too, it has smooth and tender pieces of beef with a medley of mushrooms in a nice stew. If you feel like taking a break from the meat (why would you), their Japanese style tofu is a nice choice, with bits of seafood on a plate of gently fried tofu rounds.   Traditional Sze Chuan dishes are generally hot, spicy and oily. I like the oily part the least, and often find myself using their generous portion of rice to soak up the oil instead. Even though the food portions are great, they can get pretty pricey. An appetizer plus two main dishes can easily add up to about 30 or more for a party of two. It's also an excellent idea to go in larger groups, so you can order and try out more dishes on your visit. It's afterall a Chinese style restaurant, so ordering a number of dishes to share around the table is common tradition."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese place in Madison. (Don't let the name fool you).   Trust me, the best way to experience Ichiban is to go with a big group and order several dishes and eat family-style. This is usually NOT my preferred way to go, because I don't eat red meat or pork and don't want to limit others' choices. But my Chinese-American friend who I've gone with twice suggested this for the real experience, and it didn't disappoint. The great thing is that there are so many fantastic veggie options, there was more than enough for this to work out both times we've done this with large groups.  Best dishes I've had: Pan Seared Pea Sprouts Kung Pao Chicken Singapore Mei Fun Fish in Hot Chili Sauce Sauteed Udon (with tofu) -- the udon noodles are made in-house, mmm Spicy String bean (my fave, so crazy good) Ma Po Tofu (there is one with and without pork) Sichuan Eggplant  The service is super fast and last time I went with a gluten free friend, and the waitress was very knowledgeable and careful to tell her what did and did not have gluten. Like I said I think the way to go is eat-in, family style, although my good friends order take out from here all the time. Since there is very little in the way of good Chinese take out in Madison, it's a great option."}
{"text":"I used to visit this restaurant with my friends a lot in college. Even now It's my third year since I moved to HK, I still miss the spicy food and good times here. Recommended."}
{"text":"If you would like to know the difference between \"American\" Chinese food and authentic, here is the place to go for the real deal! Absolutely delicious,"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here probably six times. The first two times were A+++ experiences and I thought the food was excellent. In addition, they actually followed my instructions for spicy food, which I viewed as a huge plus.  Since then, the quality of the food has really dipped. I cannot get them to give me spicy/hot food anymore. I don't know what happened there, but I assure you that I know what I'm asking for when I ask for spicy/hot food. I really, really loathe going to (or ordering from) a restaurant, asking for spicy food, and getting totally bland (or even worse, sweet) food. Just because this is the midwest and just because I have a totally whitebread name doesn't mean I can't take the heat.  In addition, the quality of the food itself has dropped. I rarely order noodle dishes because usually they are disappointing, but I decided to try them here. The noodles were overcooked and falling apart even though they were supposedly \"pan fried\". This may indeed be the best Chinese in Madison, but that just means that there's no good Chinese food in Madison. From now on, I'll go to the Laotian or Vietnamese places on Willy Street."}
{"text":"We ordered $40 worth of delivery last night; potstickers, shrimp fried rice, and the rabbit hot pot.   Good: fast delivery (about 35 minutes)   Bad: everything else.  * the potsticker dough was oddly crunchy and the sauce was essentially soy sauce with oil and salt added to it (I know it sounds weird but thats exactly what it tasted like)  * the fried rice had shrimp tails in it. Not attached to the shrimp itself - that I could understand - but the shrimp tails were removed from tiny, bland, and *NOT* deveined shrimp (gross!) and then, inexplicably, added to the fried rice. In their entirety. What? Why?!?   But the worst part of the order was the rabbit hot pot. Firstly, it wasn't a hot pot, it was soggy vegetables with chopped dried red peppers and what can only be described as bony wads of meat. The entire dish was overly salted and lacked any sort of broth and the meat! Oh. EM. GEE! The meat! Imagine taking Korean BBQ short ribs, balling them up, adding an entire set of human teeth and then infusing it with lard and soy sauce and you've got the Ichiban Rabbit Hot Pot. Biting into what I thought was going to be the flesh of a tasty animal and hearing bones being pulverized by my molars was enough to give me chills. It was a bizzare  experience. Never again.   In short, the best part of the meal was the steamed white rice."}
{"text":"Dumplings receive 1 star. Quite dreadful... Bland, small, and very overpriced. The crispy, spicy chicken; however , was excellent. The batter had some reminiscence of a cornmeal and had spice built in. One very nice thing was that it wasn't dripping in oil, hence it retained its crisp. Service was fine but the prices are way higher than they should be. Avoid any non-Sichuanese food here, as it is far too pricey for the quality or quantity, but since they nearly have a monopoly on authentic and tasty Sichuanese cuisine in Madison, they deserve a visit for their specialty dishes."}
{"text":"My sister and I went there randomly one night and ordered braised chicken hot pot. Its my first time eating hot pot and I got to say I can make this at home and it would be better. I am no chef but I have Asian taste buds and this dish was a disappointment. It was basically boiled chicken in red pepper garlic oil, bean sprout and a whole lot of red pepper. It was just spicy... no other flavor was there and the chicken was not braised.   The service was friendly and they tried to answer our questions but for the most part they neglected us. We had to ask for water refill twice (our mouths were on fire) and they never came to check in on us to see if we needed anything else.   Although Ichiban is lacking in decor I got to say the feel of the place is pretty nice. I think they are still in the process of decorating so hopefully things will look better soon.  Overall it was fun eating out of a pot but for the most part dont try the braised chicken hot pot unless you like the burning sensation all over your mouth. However I am willing to give it another go. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dish. Next time I'm going for the pig intestine hot pot and see how that one differs from the one I previously ate."}
{"text":"Did this place undergo new management? I haven't been here in at least 6 months and noticed immediately upon walking in that they've done a remodel. The walls are now red and they've got booths along one side. They kept the same old tattered menus, however, that looked like they can fall apart any minute.   I was craving their Dan Dan noodles and it's definitely different now. Instead of spicy Sichuan goodness, this version is closer to Thai peanut noodles. Not entirely unappetizing but not what I was expecting at all. I felt robbed!  The lunch special green curry with beef was a large portion. There was a generous amount of beef in there, along with black shiitake mushrooms, red bell peppers, snow peas and onions. My son seemed happy enough with it but I tasted it and it was also different from what I recalled in the past.   The chicken lo mein was average, not any better than a Chinese take out place. Same with the pork potstickers. The last dish that we got, scallion pancakes, was probably the best dish of our meal. It came in 8 large wedge shaped pieces and while greasy, had good flavor. I did find it weird that the waitress didn't bring out a sauce for it and she seemed confused when I asked for one. We ended up using the dipping sauce from the potstickers and that worked fine.   Bottom line, given all these changes, this place no longer distinguishes itself as one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants in Madison. It's now just like any of the dozen quick take out places in town but with higher prices.  Edit: found out why the green curry \"lunch\" portion was generous. Even though we pointed out the item clearly to the waitress on the lunch menu, she ordered it as a dinner item. So of course we got charged $12 instead of $7.50 and when I pointed this out to her, she just shrugged and did not offer to make any adjustments on the price or at the very least apologize. Another reason to not come back."}
{"text":"Great Asian food. Never thought I'd find anything comparable to Chinatown restaurants outside of Chicago. The menu is very expansive. Portions are huge (ordered an app and a dish and ate them for a few meals). The pickled pepper dishes will leave you craving forever. Not to mention, I ordered my dish \"extra spicy\" and lo and behold -- they made it spicy! Yum. Ordered out so no ratings on the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to for Chinese delivery in Madison. I haven't enjoyed all of the dishes I've ordered from them, but the Ma Po Tofu and spicy string beans are so amazing that we rarely order from any other place. Spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"I used to go to Fugu in Gilman St. for dinner. I was excited when Ichiban was opened. The first couple of times, this restaurant was OK.  The last two times, the food is not acceptable for the price. The salt and pepper octopus was not fresh and smelly and the chicken was very soft and did not taste like chicken at all. Last weekend my in-law came from out of town and my whole family went to Ichiban for dinner. My in-law ordered Lobster with ginger and scallion. It was a BIG MISTAKE. The lobster must have been frozen for months and the meat tasted awful and rotten. I confronted the owner and she admitted the lobster was not fresh. How can a restaurant serve the customer with rotten food!? I realize now the restaurant tries to cover up the inferior quality of the meat with heavy use of salt and hot pepper. But it would not work with customer with taste. It was a bad experience. I will never ever go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"I had read reviews about Ichiban and Fugu having both authentic Chinese cuisines in Madison.  I recently went to Fugu so I had to go to Ichiban.    The staff allowed us to peruse the menu for a while before taking our order.  It's huge and many things sound yummy.  We spent some time trying to get a look of other's meals without being too obvious and rude.   I decided to order 3 ingredient potstickers for all of us.  I love hot and sour soup so I ordered their sour and spicy seafood soup for myself, or so I thought.  They brought out a huge bowl of soup and three cups for everyone.  Thankfully, the others were willing to eat it.  I even ended up taking soup home.  The soup had a wonderful flavor and perfect heat.  The seafood was fake crab, canned shrimp and possibly octopus.  I didn't eat the krab or shrimp but the octopus was good.  The potstickers were great with a tasty soy sauce.  For entrees, one person got the mei fun which she loved and are it all up.  I got the shrimp in black bean sauce.  I wanted to go outside my comfort zone but I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with a safe bet.  The other person ordered poached chicken hot chili sauce.  The waitress accidentally wrote sliced fish.  It was still amazing.  He'll try the chicken next time but it was still amazing.  Overall, the food was great and fast.  I hate to say but I like Fugu a tiny bit more.  Thus, the 4 star."}
{"text":"Hands down WORST Chinese food I have ever had. Seriously over priced,  $70+for two adults and a kid to eat!  Seriously?! We ordered online for delivery. They called and said one of the items we ordered was not available, they offered spicy chicken,  I told them it was for a child and they responded that they would not make it spicy,  well, pretty much the whole bowl was szechuan peppers with a couple pieces of spicy chicken. My husband ordered guozi which was tripe soup. Not what he wad expecting.  The general tso tofu was ok,  I've had much better from cheaper places. I don't recommend this place at all. Just bad."}
{"text":"Amazing new chinese resturant in madison. Most importantly, its style is spicy szechuan which I love.My fav szechaun resturant in china town chicago is Lao Sze Chaun, which is by far the best chinese food place I have ever been to. I must say Ichiban is comparable to that. Food is awwsome,very spicy but in a great way. Service is a bit spotty, but they more than made up with the food. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food, this is the place to go. They have legitimate Sichuan Chinese food that my family and I love. They can make any dish spicy and still taste unique and delicious. The prices are also reasonable, and the serving sizes are quite generous as well. One of the better Chinese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The Kung Pao and the eggplant were both spicy and tasty if a little oily.  I looked around and noticed no overweight lunchers despite that.  The lunch portions were smaller and correspondingly cheaper.  The space was quiet and pleasant."}
{"text":"Definitely an authentic Chinese restaurant. (*Note: Although the name of the restaurant sounds Japanese; it's Chinese cuisine all the way.)  We came in a group of 5-- a group of hungry people. We had researched the restaurant and we weren't disappointed. The menu had a variety of dishes, from vegetables to exotic foods to seafood and meat.   We enjoyed the pot sticker combo (seafood, meat and veggie).  The Kung Pao Chicken, a popular Sichuan dish in China--one that is usually a disappointment when prepared in this country--was good. We also had the Thick Pan-Fried Rice Noodles with shrimp (which is actually wide, not thick!) The noodles we very tasty. Finally we enjoyed the Sichuan sauce with tofu, which was wonderfully spicy.   The service was quite good, we would eat there again.  So we definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch, read the great reviews on Yelp and since we were in the neighborhood thought we would give it a try. We ordered Fried rice, Orange Shrimp and General Tso's chicken. The Orange shrimp was fantastic, large shrimp and the sauce was just spicy right. Friend rice and General Tso's chicken also had great flavor and the portions are large.   As others have mentioned the prices are high. Our lunch with tip was $43.00!! $1.75 for a cup of Tea??!!   Overall, the food is great, the atmosphere nice and the service average."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and I have yet to have bad food. Both times I have been with another person and we swapped lots of food. Everything is pretty spicy but I was also able to order very traditional meals while there. The wait staff is young, but friendly without hovering. The atmosphere is low lit and quiet enough to enjoy a conversation with your food. The food is absolutely outstanding. I can't wait to go back for a third time and try something new."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food.  It's the best we have found so far.  Huge menu and service is fast.  I will recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"My noodle soup came in a bowl that was chipped. My tea came in a cup that was chipped. Everything we ordered looked as though it had been drenched in the same oily chili sauce. There was literally 3/8\" of this oil floating on top of my soup . Won't try this place again."}
{"text":"Definitely good place for foodies like me, tried couple items on the menu they all tasted good..A bit pricey though overall really good place with nice ambient and food :)"}
{"text":"Having visited on two occasions, I definitely recommend this place for some yummy Sichuan cuisine.  For those first time visitors, have confidence as you go in. I'm not sure what is typical but I just grabbed some menus and sat my party down at a table of my choice. If no one directs you as you walk in, just do it yourself.  FYI, look for the slightly numbing/tingling feeling the spicy dishes do to your mouth. This is the famous sichuan pepper and provides a unique and (I think) a pleasurable experience, much more complexity than just being a 'hot' addition.  The dishes I've tried are as follows (additional comments are further on): -ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce -sichuan dan dan noodles -ma po tofu -eggplant with chili garlic sauce -homestyle twice cooked pork -seafood soup -raspberry smoothie with bubbles (tapioca pearls - a nice chewy surprise)  I look forward to visiting again and giving a go to my first Hotpot experience. If your coming here, don't order sesame chicken or general tso. From what I've know, that's not Chinese food. Get the real stuff and expand your horizons. If you need a suggestion to get you going, order the twice cooked pork. That is a very popular choice.   Also, 1 dish per person (and share!!!) is plenty but and extra one or two is fun for diversity (you can bring home the extra!)   Here is other info: ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce: if you haven't had tongue you could be in for a treat. Tongue is a common food in many cultures. When prepared right it is very tender and tasty.  sichuan dan dan noodles: a very nice spicy noodle dish. I really enjoyed it though having a noodle dish as an appetizer is different for me... it seems too filling so feel free to try it as a entree, it is large enough  ma po tofu: a spicy and slightly thickened chili sauce with pork (optional) and tofu. goes excellently with rice  eggplant with chili garlic sauce: the eggplant has a nice sweetness to it. quite good  homestyle twice cooked pork: Delicious! So tender and bursting with flavor. The 'homestyle' version includes little buns to eat with the meat. I would definitely recommend the twice cooked pork though I would not say it is necessary get the buns.  seafood soup: this was alright... not quite my favorite."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. It definitely leans spicier, more vegetable heavy, and more traditional than any other such restaurant in Madison that I've tried. Almost everything I've had (dine in and take out) has been fantastic. Some dishes are a little more typical of americanized spots (such as the lo mein), but still beat the other places in town.  One issue is that the full menu is not completely pulled into most of the online ordering services, so there can be some surprises if you order off of say, GrubHub. For instance, my favorite dish there is San Bei (three cup) Chicken -- Ichiban's menu lets you know that it is chopped and bone-in, GrubHub does not -- it was a little surprising though delicious."}
{"text":"Because this place had a 4 star rating we decided to try it for dinner.  We ordered chicken feet as appetizers, dry sauteed green beans, kung pao chicken and a seafood dish.  The worst dinner EVER!.  The chicken feet were pickled, rubbery and not spicy at all. The other dishes were so salt laden my wife spat hers out and I gagged on my first bite. The kung pao sauce, aside from being way too salty, had no other flavour and was watery.  We complained to the manager who said there must have been \"a little too much salt\". Try there must have been half a container used for it to be this over-salted.  I don;t know if they were trying to give us the heave ho but as there was only one table there and they were friends of the manager I am assuming they were not inclined to new customers.  Don't bother trying this place, nothing authentic here."}
{"text":"The food from ichiban was fantastic, save for the veggie dumplings, which where pretty much cold, two of the six were stale and rock hard on the edges and the dipping sauce was nothing like a dumpling sauce but like a vinegar/soy mix (bleh!)... BUT that was the only bad part of our meal!  Despite that they were out of spinach and my GF had to order something different (this was for delivery), the tofu and black mushrooms was excellant and flavorful.   The Tofu and Greens Soup was tasty as well, but I think its not 100% vegetarian, as the broth seemed more like a meat broth?  Im not positive because I did not ask.  I may the next time.  The Orange Chicken was AWESOME!  Perhaps the best I have had in town.  I believe this is what actual orange chicken may be like in Asia, with the orange rinds, garlic chunks, red chilis, and such that it was not super sweet like the pan-asian/Americanized dish that everyone is more familiar with. This was an excellant flavor experience!  Delivery was FAST!"}
{"text":"Good Sichuan food, but when it tries to accomodate customers with a more Chinese-American palate and expectations, it produces mediocre, bland dishes. It should stick to the former.  Waitstaff can be unhelpful and downright indifferent at times.  We've seen the dining area full of soiled dishes and dinnerware when staff should have cleaned the space."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch with a few coworkers.  Ordered the General T'so Chicken off of the $7.50 lunch menu (11-3, M-F) and it was fantastic!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sauce was complex and I could see & taste the peppers, garlic and ginger.  My coworkers ordered the Black Bean Sauce with Pork and the Sichuan Sauce with Chicken and both tasted great.  The veggies in their dishes were fresh and crisp.  Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, filling my water when needed.  I will be returning, hopefully often."}
{"text":"OK. 4 stars for the food 2 stars for the experience.  The place is crazy, when we got there it was fairly quiet except for this waiter who ran around like a bull in a china shop. The staff were all yelling at each other and there was loud karaoke or something coming from the back room. A waitress approached us who was so soft spoken, I could not hear a word she said. It was bazaar. That said the Ma Po tofu was outstanding (albeit off of the veggie menu and loaded with pork)"}
{"text":"I am really sad to give the restaurant a 2 star review, because some of the staff (probably owners) are actually pretty friendly. However, today's Saturday afternoon visit was a really bad visit.  What makes me uncomfortable and offended my husband was the lady who served us. When I asked for no ice for my water, the young lady server didn't reply. She came back with water without ice silently.  We needed to go to the counter to ask for order service, just to see 2 young ladies busy chatting (should we order at the cashier?) We asked for some extra utensils just to be treated with (passive aggressive) silence again, plus we had to go over to the counter for any extra water or ready to pay.  The food was greasy as usual, but that seems to be the nature of Chinese food. We couldn't finish the dish because it was all in oil, and we didn't feel healthy after eating...  I wanted to support this restaurant very much but after this time, I probably won't come back after a very long while.  No one wants to be treated badly for a lovely Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Not sure why a Schezwan restaurant is named Ichiban, but oh well. The food is decent. Less salt, and even more spice would make it better. The waiter we had was pretty bad (unenthusiastic, slow), but the Chinese staff seemed to pick up his slack."}
{"text":"A really great spot. Real Chinese food. Very broad menu including very authentic cuisine. We go here a few times a month. Casual and kid friendly. Great service. Try the spicy chicken and we love the garlic pork."}
{"text":"We ate here, named Ichiban Restaurant on the awning, on Christmas day 2012.  The place was pretty packed with big tables, so I understand they may have been pushed near capacity.  However, things were not great.  The hectic restaurant has very shaky, hollow floors.  As the waitstaff stomped around, the table shook quite a bit, making for an uncomfortable dining experience.  Several tables around us were complaining amongst themselves as we waited for our food.  Not a good sign.  We ordered some staples. MaPo Tofu, Pad Thai, and a Cold mushroom app per yelper recommendation.  The MaPo was pretty good if incredibly salty, but the Pad Thai was pretty gross, with a strong bell pepper forward flavor and absolutely smothered in a pretty gross tomatoey sauce.  The sauce was reminiscent of Chef Boyardee canned products.  So, ok, the Thai dish at the Chinese restaurant wasn't that good.  Whatever.    However, we never received the appetizer, but were charged for it, and no wait staff ever returned to our table.  Our water was never filled.  We weren't really able to tell who was supposed to be our server.  With all these positive reviews, I hope that if I ever make it back here they live up to their reputation."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer, I don't know why on earth I waited so long to come back, because it is awesome. I went here again for dinner last night with a large group of friends (9 people total). We ordered 7 dishes for everyone to share, and every last one of them was delicious (something I was honestly not expecting given the large number of choices) and tasted balanced - none of them was too spicy, greasy, sweet, or salty. The spicy dishes are spicy at a good level where you can taste the other ingredients and not just burning. I was particularly fond of the salt-and-pepper squid, the crispy and spicy chicken, and tofu in garlic sauce. The food seemed to come out really quickly, and service was great, even with our big group. This time I am not going to wait 9 months to come back :)"}
{"text":"This place was a saving grace for me. Being from out of town and being used to a plethora of Asian cuisine being everywhere, I  couldn't believe how there were so few authentic Chinese places. It's like there is a drought of authentic Chinese cuisine and thankfully this was the ONLY watering hole. Their string bean with garlic dish is always a go to dish along with the ox tongue and tripe. The double cooked pork was great. The spicy crispy chicken and beef brisket hot pot was definitely a favorite with the chicken just being spicy enough and succulent. And last but not least, the spicy crispy fish as well. I really hope this place thrives so if I ever have to come back, this will be my go to place to feel at home."}
{"text":"Hate to do this, but I should probably report on my subpar Kung Pao chicken lunch special.  It was supposed to be spicy, but it had big chunks of peppers, which made it hard to eat.  Also, there was some strong ginger and one other ingredient that I really didn't like.  But worst of all, it was just really low quality, fatty chicken.  I threw two thirds of it out."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant by far! Crispy Spicy Chicken is my favorite dish! The only food I get here!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is wonderful. Never once have I had a bad experience in the last five visits. My only recommendation to people is to understand that this is authentic. If you ask them for something like egg foo young, they might look at you kind of funny. The menu items are priced reasonable enough to try several things and share."}
{"text":"This place is pretty authentic as to all the spicy Sichuan dishes comparatively to other Chinese restaurants in town.   Just don't expect any good service.  If anything prepare to have your utensils tossed on your table,  water cups overflown, and dishes to arrive in unprecedented manner.   The prices are a bit of a sticker shock for a Chinese establishment,  the are comparable to Peking Palace or PF Chang's,  but as others have echoed,  the portions are huge.    I love the mapo tofu,  west lake beef soup,  dan dan noodles,  steamed chicken slices in chili oil sauce,  spicy garlic string beans,  fried rice,  and gyoza.  They have hot pots!"}
{"text":"Ichiban is up there with the best Chinese in Madison.   Most of the menu is authentic with a few American standards thrown in.  Think General Tso's chicken.   It's best to come with a few adventurous friends and order several items. The portions are huge for the prices.  String beans with or without minced pork and cumin lamb are my faves.    I will be back. Soon."}
{"text":"It's the service.  The food is great.  But twice in a row I've received half my order and had trouble getting them to deliver the second half.  This most recent time I've had to contact Eat Street and have my meal refunded.  I'm sure in the store it's different, but if you plan on delivery, plan on a better experience elsewhere.    Note:  I've recently recommended going here instead of Orient House because of the service there.  I swear, the only thing I'm asking is to have a complete warm order arrive when they tell me it will."}
{"text":"Yum real Szechuan food at reasonable prices! Food comes out very fast and there is a 9% discount for paying cash. I loved the frog and hot and sour soup. I also thought the twice cooked pork was delicious but my Szechuan mother said the pork slices didn't curl enough."}
{"text":"On our road trip back home from Chicago to Minneapolis, we decided to stop in Madison for lunch.  After indulging in all kinds of bar food while on vacation, I was craving a different cuisine; so Chinese was the final decision.  The service we received was great, we were seated right away and our food came quickly after we'd ordered it. The waitress was helpful in aiding us with our decisions on what to get. My boyfriend and I started with some Hot & Sour soup then shared the Kung Pao Chicken and the Red Curry Chicken. Both dishes came with side bowls of rice (more than enough definitely).  The portions are large, so if you don't have a huge appetite I'd recommend sharing one dish between two people.   I'm giving this three stars because the Sichuan pepper spice was good and left my mouth feeling slightly numb, but the food was overall A-OK. Some of the pieces of chicken in the Kung Pao dish were a little chewy and fatty which grossed me out a bit. The Red Curry Chicken was better and I enjoyed the snap peas, zucchini, and mushrooms which were part of the dish. The hot & sour soup was a little thicker than I enjoy but it warmed me up and was still okay!  This restaurant is a little unique because the SIchuan spice is so different and not many places specialize in dishes that use it. But honestly, I would have enjoyed some unhealthy, greasy \"mall\" chinese food more."}
{"text":"I had lunch there a few weeks ago with a large group. I'm still thinking about the kung pao chicken. Addictively delicious! There's the chili heat, but also another unfamiliar and wonderful flavor. Sichuan pepper? In any case, I'm hooked. The menu is very large, with an \"American-style Chinese\" section at the back. If you're overwhelmed, just try the kung pao!"}
{"text":"After a 3-day drive from California to Wisconsin, I took my mom to this restaurant in hopes of reassuring her that decent Chinese food exists in Madison.  It was 1:30pm, on a Wednesday, and when we walk in to the dimly lit, empty restaurant, the two male employees (waiter A and B) stare at me and my mom blankly.  We ask them if they're open for lunch, and they say yes.  Then waiter A takes two menus, walks over to a table and drops them down, and goes over to lay down a tablecloth over another table.  My mom and I walk over to this table and seat ourselves.  We figure out the menu, and wait to order.  And wait.... and wait. Waiter B, who is sitting behind the counter 10ft away from us the entire time, seems to be tremendously engrossed in his phone.  So much so that we watched as he walked over to his charger to plug his phone in, and continue twiddling his thumbs, both metaphorically and literally.  After five minutes of wondering whether that Time article about millenials was in fact about this employee, he looks up, sees that we need to order, and _proceeds to ask waiter A to come back out and take our order_.  Waiter A comes out, has to hang up the phonecall that _he_ was on, and finally takes our order.  Our food arrives relatively quickly (in fact all four dishes took less time than we had to wait to order), so at least the kitchen is competent.  Not surprisingly, Waiter A, the same guy who \"showed us our table\" served the food by dropping it on our table, and walking away.   In the end, the food was great, but what passes for lunchtime service will leave a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"I placed an order for take out this week from Ichiban Sichuan, using Yelp. The delivery minimum is $15. The estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes. The food arrived on time. The driver called me from the first floor of my building, but i think he thought my unit was on the other side of the street. He saw me in the entry way and came to give me our food order.  My boyfriend ordered Kung Pau and I had the Orange Chicken. Both meals were tasty. I warn you that they put peppers in the dish that are super spicy. They are in big pieces so you can easily move off your meat. Overall, the food was great. I would order from here again. I would also say it made me sad that they did not include fortune cookies with this delivery. I am not sure if this something they do all the time, could be."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Ichiban after reading the reviews here on Yelp.  It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to get my order, which was lukewarm at best and didn't come with any of the usual sauces.  Fried rice was mostly plain white rice with egg and you know how you can get a bag of frozen peas and cubed carrots in the store?  Yeah, it had that in it too.  I'm underwhelmed to say the least.  Can't say I will ever order from here again.  You can't win them all."}
{"text":"Had another great meal at Ichiban.  Arrived at 230 this afternoon -- still in time for the lunch specials which ends at about 3 o'clock. Ordered the Thai red curry with chicken served along with steamed rice. Service was excellent - no waiting and very pleasant waitress. Order came out promptly. The red curry was delicious. Always a good experience at this place."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese! Love the Hot Pots! Love the big portions to share! Love the use of spices!"}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow, and the food was okay. I'll probably try other places before coming back."}
{"text":"The ma la is real.  I was so pleased to find a Chinese menu that wasn't full of the standard Americanized fare, and the food delivered.    I ordered the fried shredded beef in chili sauce and the cucumber with Chinese dipping sauce to cool things down.  The entree was well balanced with nice florals coming through from the peppercorn and plenty of aromatics.  I ordered it \"spicy\" which is one step down from the hottest and found it to be just right (I love spicy food, but I don't like it so spicy that I sweat.).   Again, the peppercorn came through but was not so heavy handed that I felt like I just went to the dentist.    I am sad that this place isn't near my home, but I will certainly come back next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"The food was very good. However, I want to talk about the man delivering the food. 1. NEVER said any polite words such as \"hello, bye and thank you\". (Not just me, I've asked several friends. They had similar experience.) 2. HANG up my phone before finishing talking. 3. LET me going out for dozens of meters to get the delivery with short sleeve and short pant when it was snowing heavily (about -5 F). AND he was unwillingly to walk towards me. 4. ALWAYS complain about the tips with really really bad temper. (I usually give about 10%)"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Sichuan Chinese food!! Don't come here if you're expecting your typical Americanized Chinese food, because they specialize in the typically spicy Sichuan cooking.  My personal favorites include the dry braised chicken with spicy sauce in hot pot (under gan guo), the spicy shredded potato, ox tongue (be adventurous! it's so good), and twice cooked pork.  Seriously the best REAL Chinese food I've had in Madison. A real local treasure."}
{"text":"GREAT Chinese food ?spicy?i like spicy food , spicy crisp chicken ,spicy string bean,\eggplant with spicy gralic sauce,thin wrap pork in sauce , sichuan style cucumber,its awesome?"}
{"text":"Ichiban is an excellent restaurant. The diners are almost all Chinese. I want to try everything but get timid when it comes time to order. The menu is huge and I cannot really tell what the dish is like before it arrives. The waitstaff speaks limited English and are unable to really help you out.   I have been to Ichiban 3 times and each time I have enjoyed my meal. The food can be very oily but that is the case at Fugu as well, another authentic Chinese restaurant. Vegetables are fresh and crispy, tofu light and puffy and the sauces are diverse rather than everything tasting the same. My guy ordered the Cumin Flavored beef with Chili Sauce which was our least favorite dish. I have enjoyed the Sichuan sauce twice, once with chicken and once with tofu. I loved the Japanese Tofu in Hot Pot, Braised Vegetable with Shitake Mushroom and the Vegetable Dumplings.   You must give Ichiban a try. i have never waited more than 10 minutes for my food to arrive.  I am hellbent on spending an evening there just interviewing folks about what they are eating.  I love moo-shu pork but this is a whole different ballgame."}
{"text":"Going to be a short review, as I just tried their delivery service on Sunday. But it's a happy one, too!  Was very impressed with their delivery. It came about 30-40 min after I ordered, which was about the amount of time they said it would take so I was prepared. It also arrived very hot which is a definite plus.   I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and Potstickers. Both were delish! The chicken was in fairly large pieces, which I enjoyed because it made me feel like I was actually eating chicken. Too many times have I gotten those tiny pieces of fried something-or-other at other Chinese restaurants. Not here! There was also just the right amount of breading and sauce on the chicken. It was sweet and spicy but not too much of either. The broccoli was also cooked perfectly. Not soggy at all. Potstickers were very good. I like when they have a little bit of crunch to them on the ends, which these did. The dipping sauce was also yummy. I finished them in about 5 minutes.   Besides eating the Potstickers all at once, the chicken entree is definitely enough food for 2 meals. You also get a side of white rice with your entree. Next time I order from here I will definitely attempt to be a bit more adventurous as some of the things recommended on here sound awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh Wow! This place is in the top 2 for Chinese restaurants in Madison. Food is authentic and they can make it really spicy. Recommend any of the whitefish dishes.  Only thing keeping it from a 5 star is that dining area was full of dirty tables and chairs are a touch uncomfortable. They do takeout though!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese Restaurant with acceptable prices! We eight went there tonight and were very satisfied with the food. The dining fee is less than $20 per person. One thing is, if you have more than five people, the tips will be automatically added to your bill, you don't have to pay for a second time. I will go back again: )"}
{"text":"We stooped for our first time for an early dinner.  The menu was huge and filled with a variety of items that caught our attention for the good and for the bad (ie everything with intestine).  We were less than daring and ordered three items.    We tried to order pan fried dumplings but the waiter redirected us to the pot stickers.  Good advice.   They were perfect.  We then asked for entree recommendations.  The first was a beautiful looking and quite tasty beef ginger and scallion plate.  The second dish of chicken and basil was quite tasty but the chicken pieces were splintered with bones and difficult if not dangerous to eat!    Overall the taste and quality of it all was very good and we will go back.  We will not order anything from the chicken portion of the menu."}
{"text":"They have the best Szchuan food in Madison. A little bit pricey compared to other places."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and maybe not so sweet... Not my favorite.   The server/host whatever he was was kind or rude and the woman who brought our food from the kitchen didn't smile or say a word or respond when we thanked her.  No one checked up on us after we got our food and we had to get out of our chairs to go ask for our check  The food was sub par. The prices are high and I wasn't impressed.  I had sesame chicken and my friend had some sort of chicken that was basically tiny chunks of deep fried chicken that was kind of crunchy with no sauce,  gross.   My chicken was ok... But it was a lot of breading and the sauce was too sweet. There are better options in Madison"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Ichiban the other day.  We got: Green bean appetizer. Very good.  Dumplings: BAD. Badbadbad. I'm positive they were a brand of frozen dumplings I used to buy at Woodman's.  Spring rolls: Soft and not flavorful. I'm willing to bet these were also frozen.  Rice: I thought the rice was good. Sticky and thick grains. Not typical of the asian delivery I'm used to.  Cashew Chicken: Bland. My boyfriend didn't like it and I ended up eating most of it because my dish was almost inedible.  San Bei Chicken: Decent flavor but nothing to rave about. I googled this dish before ordering and the ingredients sounded delicious. I found chunks of ginger and garlic in my dish and that's great. I wasn't prepared for bone shards and slivers. I know San Bei chicken is made by chopping chicken bits up and cooking them with spices/sauce so I was prepared for full on bone chunks but NOT for slivers. Actual slivers and splinters of bone wrapped up in chicken made eating this dish impossible and dangerous. I spent 20 minutes picking the bones out of my food and ended up with a bowl full of rice and sauce. I was very upset by this.   We ended up throwing the food away because there just wasn't a point to eating it anymore.  I would have had the rest of the chicken for breakfast, but biting down on bone bits isn't appetizing.   I am especially disappointed because of all the raving reviews on Yelp and Grubhub. This food wasn't good and we wont be ordering from or eating here again."}
{"text":"At Bob S' behest, I finally got around to ordering from Ichiban.  First, I would just like to say this was the fastest delivery order yet. We placed our order at ~7:30, and received a call at 7:50. I was expecting an hour's wait, as is typical for delivery in Madison, and was pleasantly surprised.   Second, this place has real, yes REAL, scallion pancakes (though it could have been crunchier). Ever since moving here from Boston, I have been on a crusade to find scallion pancakes. I've tried dozens of Chinese places, and have received bread with scallions, fried crepes with scallions, but never actual scallion pancakes... Until now.  Now, moving on to the actual food, which is among the most authentic Szechuan cuisine (along with Fugu) in all of Madison.   We ordered the ox tongue and triple with chili sauce (different cuts of beef doused in chili oil), scallion pancakes (yay finally), eggplant with chili garlic sauce (huge chunks of sweet eggplants immersed in chili sauce) and poached sliced fish in hot chili sauce (the most tender fish you will ever have).  The meal also came with 2 boxes of white rice, perfect for soaking up all the chili sauce.   Though, for some reason, there were no fortune cookies. C'mon Ichiban, you need to get with the game here.  That being said, everything was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be stuffing my face with their dishes sometime soon.   One thing of note is that the prices are slightly higher than most Chinese places in Madison, but I'd say it's well worth it."}
{"text":"My partner and I tried Ichiban Sichuan for dinner the other night. The food was outstanding!  When we arrived, it was pretty busy but there were a few tables available. The hostess was pretty engrossed with someone, but she eventually led us to a table and provided us with menus. It took awhile, but eventually a waitress came by to take our order. (They were quite busy and the waitresses seemed very busy.) We ordered the String Bean with Garlic Sauce, the Lamb with Cumin, and the Pan Fried Thick Rice Noodle with Pork. We were surprised that the String Bean appetizer was served cold. It was a little jarring at first, but after a few bites I was a fan. The garlic was almost creamy and buttery and every bite was delicious. The lamb with cumin had just a little spice but it grew over time and again the flavors and textures were amazing. I'm not a huge rice noodle fan but the pork and the sauce were delicious.  Beyond the incredible food, two things that stood out for me most. When I went to use the restroom it was not only immaculate, it smelled good. Some restrooms have an odor where you want to get in and out as quickly as possible, but this restroom was actually pleasant.  Also, we biked over. There is a dearth of places to lock your bike nearby. Having some bike racks close would be a great improvement."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Tried the dandan noodles, fried shredded beef in chili sauce, and spicy and crispy chicken. All had good heat without being over the top. Food came out very fast."}
{"text":"Always count on Ichiban when we crave authentic Chinese!!! Everything we eat here is good. Wendy, the owner is the best!!! Love Ox Tongue appetizer,    Beef with spicy capsicum and spicy crispy fish!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Madison! Spicy, authentic, clean, friendly atmosphere,  this place is great."}
{"text":"A relatively big Chinese restaurant in Madison. Food are all classical Sichuan cuisines and are all very delicious (a little spicy though, to a Chinese from south China). Very good for a group of people having a dinner together since Ichiban has a big room and many big tables. Food amount for each dish also seems appropriate: 5 dishes were enough to feed us 6 people. One thing really impressive to me is that even in a Friday night like today with maybe more than 50 or more people dining in, we could have our dishes within 10 minutes after we placed our order. Our waitress was also very nice and filled in our water cup frequently. Overall 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"When my friend told me we were going to a chinese restaurant called Ichiban, i assumed it was one of those dime a dozen chinese-japanese-generic asian buffets.   When she said it was the best chinese restaurant in town, I had a good laugh. But upon arriving, I was pleasantly surprised. We had the braised lamb which had all the right spices and boy was it tasty - this is no americanized chinese food. Upon leaving saw the hots - will have to come back to try one of those..."}
{"text":"We came here for a class reunion, and this is a great place for events like that! The food was authentic and almost all varieties of Chinese foods could be found. It has a bunch of large tables for larger groups too.  Also they have milk tea, which is a bit unexpected for Chinese Sichuan restaurant. The service was also nice, since we came in very late, and stayed until almost they are closed. But they were always nice."}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the good reviews on here.  First, this is not a Japanese restaurant if the name suggested otherwise.  It really shouldn't even be considered a Chinese restaurant as the food does injustice to what is actually good Sze Chuan / Chinese food.    Second, I'm not the best cook in the world, but I feel like I can stir fry green beans and sizzling beef (or \"hibachi beef\" as they call it) much better than this place.  The food was way too salty and tasted worse than the Chang Jiang Americanized stuff, especially given the not-so-cheap prices ($15 for the hibachi blob, $10 for the green beans).   Third, tea is charged per cup ($1.75) with free refills.  Since it was per cup anyways, I asked to have a different tea from my co-diner, but the server was basically too lazy to brew two different kettles, so she told us that they only had one type of tea.  Sure.  They really should just charge per kettle, like almost every other Chinese restaurant in the country.  I really wanted to support Asian restaurants in Madison out of the hope that more will spring up, but this is just plain bad.  If you want to try what is actually good Sze Chuan food, please do yourself a favor and drive to Chinatown in Chicago and go to Lao Sze Chuan.  Then come back and revise your review for this place."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical as I drove up to Ichiban Sichuan because when I looked into the window I didn't see anyone inside. As I walked into the restaurant (because I trust Yelper's reviews), the other half of the restaurant was packed.   We were promptly seated and given glasses of water along with a set of menus. After going over the vast menu, we decided on a mapo tofu, spicy dried intestines, and spicy fish hotpot with mushrooms.   All three dishes were out on the table within 10 minutes. I've never been to a restaurant where the food is served piping hot in a matter of minutes. All three dishes were delicious. The food wasn't too spicy, but it had a great flavor. The mapo tofu was served piping hot with tons of meat and spicy sauce. The fish hot pot was not too spicy but had a nice kick to it. There was plenty of fish along with a good portion of enoki mushrooms and bean sprouts. The dried intestines was a little disappointing. The flavor was good, but it wasn't as crispy as I expected. Overall the flavor of the food was excellent, but on the greasy side. So, if you don't have a iron stomach, you might want to only get one spicy dish.   I definitely will be back one more time before I leave Madison. Thanks again Ichiban Sichuan for the delicious meal!!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Chinese food in Madison, hands down.  What I love about this place: - authentic (many dishes which are difficult to find elsewhere) - delicious! The meats are always unbelievably tender and the the food so flavorful (esp if you like spicy- which is what Szechuan cuisine is known for) - can easily accomodate large parties   Go there! Now!"}
{"text":"Last few tries have been more hit and miss.  Difficult to order and food quality has been off sometimes."}
{"text":"This place definitely satisfied my chinese sichuan food cravings. Why it starts with a japanese phase...i'm not sure but it could be considered number one for madison chinese food. We came with a party of 12 and it was easy to make a reservation as well as order a ton of food to try. We did family style and ordered; poached fish, crispy chicken, won tons, eggplant in garlic sauce, green beans, rice, broiled pork belly, tripe, salt and pepper shrimp, and kung pao chicken. i honestly probably forgot some items since we ordered so much, but it was great! We all helped ourself to the food and it came out in succession and fed us all to a good level. I highly recommend the eggplant as it is one of my favorite dishes of all time.   Happy Eating!!!"}
{"text":"Ichiban Sichuan, as the name implies, specializes in Sichuan food. They serve many of the best Sichuan dishes in Madison, including ox tongue with chili sauce, spicy string beans, eggplant with chili garlic sauce, salt and pepper shrimp, and shredded pork with pickled pepper. Their Sichuan dishes are on the oily side as per tradition, but are also by far the most flavorful and authentic that I have found in Madison. The food is also infinitely better when eaten at the restaurant as opposed to takeout/delivery.   If you are looking for Chinese takeout-style dishes (lo mein, chicken and broccoli, general Tso's, etc.), your best bet is to look elsewhere, as this is not the style that Ichiban does best-or cheapest. Ichiban excels at Sichuan cuisine, so I highly encourage everyone eating here to order dishes from that region."}
{"text":"I have visited Ichiban at least 10 times. This place serves legit Chinese food, Szechuan/Sichuan specialty. In terms of food, it is definitely among, if not the best in Madison. If you want to try some authentic stuff, you are at the right place. This is reflected in the fact that Ichiban is probably the most popular dinner gathering place for the Chinese-speaking students on UW campus.   Then, why not five stars? 1) The price is less affordable than places such as oriental house (just next door!) or Double 10 (newest authentic restaurant on the block at time of this review), and i think you get less out your bucks at Ichiban  2) Food could be a little too oily and spicy for people not accustomed to Sichuan cooking. 3) I do not usually care much about service than the food itself,  but yes, their service is pretty bad, as other Yelper mentioned."}
{"text":"Really tasty, a little bit pricey, great heat to the food. It was a pleasant surprise to find in Wisconsin for sure."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Got fooled by Japanese name. As soon as you walk in the door, a sign of today's special all written in Chinese. Should have checked Yelp first. Or walked out. Service very slow even though we came late for lunch. Ordered green tea. No taste and not hot. Chopsticks, another sign, not Japanese. Music is also Chinese. Well we ordered any way, too late if day to go somewhere else. I just still can't understand why you have to trick people like this with the name. Looks like they are going to try to do sushi, they have a sushi cooler but right now has fruit or something in it. Not fish.  Food came same time as soup. Mom ordered garlic beef not spicy. Came without garlic. I order Shicuan beef, it was ok, not the best. It took a while before server came to ask how we were doing. When we explained about the garlic, server took the plate, came back with a woman who just couldn't understand what was wrong. My food got cold explaining. Then finally offered to make new. Rice is also Chinese. Lots of it and dry. The server is very nice and well mannered guy. But I dont think we will be back.    I'd to explain my \" pickiness\" when it comes to Japanese food. My mother is Japanese, I'm half, born there. My husband is Japanese.  If are going to be serving Chinese or something other then what you lead the customers to believe, you are totally Fake!  We cook Japanese food at home but it is nice to get out of cooking and have someone else cook it and serve with a smile.  If I want Chinese, I go to Chinese. If I want American , I go to eat American food. If I want African, same. I just don't get it. You might be able to fool some people , but eventually , the causes you are making will catch with you. I didn't even want to give this place an one star. Just as bad as the Edo down the street. Why people? Do you keep on getting fooled , if you pay cheap, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Wow - so Marissa and I have lived about 8 blocks from this little gem and have finally found it!  I was highly impressed by almost everything - the only negative I could say was that maybe the food came out too fast? I guess all things considered that is a pretty small problem. Seriously though the food came out in less than 5 minutes which really worked out well for us as we were in a bit of a hurry but others may not be happy with that.  I had Tofu with Shitake Mushrooms extra spicy and Marissa ordered the Mapo Tofu which was also fabulous. We could have simply ordered one of these dishes as along with the Seaweed Salad and Vegatable Dumplings which was way more than we could finish in one sitting.  This is going to be our new GO-TO place for our Chinese cravings!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Closest to 'authentic'. You can request less salt and no MSG. I do hope that they train more of their staff to understand that when you order over the phone."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. This place is the best Chinese/Thai in Madison! Every time my family goes here it's great. Nice staff, and easy to do take out too. We are a bunch of foodies, but still list this as one of our favorites over many of the upscale/nice restaruants in town. Whenever we order/try something new, it ends up being GREAT! My favorite is the Chicken Pad Thai, but the whole menu seems to be all deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Get the string beans with garlic sauce.  I know, I know, how good can they be?  They're just freaking beans, right?  Get them.  The food is noticeably and consistently fresher and more flavorful than the other Asian delivery I've had so far in Madison.  Without digging around I can actually see vegetables and huge pieces of tender chicken in my Pad Thai. Yum."}
{"text":"The best authentic Chinese food in Wisconsin.  Sichuan food is spicy and oily so be prepare for a large blast of flavor.  I love ordering the poach fish, spicy crispy chicken and the saute pork intestine."}
{"text":"3 star is being nice.  I was here last month with colleagues from the office.  We ordered quite a variety to share.  The Mao pao tofu was delicious that day!  Couldn't wait to come back to have it again.   Back today with the family for lunch...boy were we disappointed.  Ou Mao pao tofu had so much food enhancer my hubby and I could feel our lips tingling.  Not a good feeling.  Out beef lomein was greasy(especially since I asked for less oil).  The Chinese vegetable dish with fresh garlic was blah...lack favor & salt.  Where can we go for good healthy flavorful Chinese food????"}
{"text":"Went to Ichiban last night with a pretty large group of people. They were very accommodating! The service was fantastic--the woman who took care of our table was very meticulous.  We got several appetizers including ox tongue, spicy chicken, dumplings, and pan-fried scallion cakes. Everything was really good! The texture of the ox tongue was a little weird, but that could have been the individual piece. I tried a little bit of a few entrées including the hot pot, which was so good! I had the lo mein noodles with spicy minced pork. It was pretty disappointing, actually. The lo mein noodles were way too soft and the minced pork was actually ground pork. It was kind of like eating spaghetti with the noodles drowned in sauce. Not a fan. One thing that I thought was particularly good was the rice! It was very sticky and held flavor nicely. Definitely not regular take-out fare. All in all it was a hit-or-miss dinner with mostly hits. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Had takeout from here: dan dan noodles and poached pork with extra rice.  First of all that was way too much food for one person and it easily stretched into 5 meals: the noodles are more than enough for two dinners and the pork with the rice can make 3 lunches. Next time I'll add an order of some kind of stir fried greens and make a more balanced series of meals ;)  The noodles themselves were delicious. They were thicker tan most dan dan noodles I had and seemed fresh. The sauce was deliciously spicy without being overwhelming. The poached pork was irresistibly tender. I loved every bite of it. It came with a  very spicy szchuan pepper sauce that went great with the rice (you need the white rice to absorb some of that spiciness) and complemented the subtle sweetness of the pork.  Now I am debating whether I should order more or try to figure out the recipe... Maybe I'll order, last time delivery was super quick!"}
{"text":"Tried 3 different dishes. The fish with intestines is probably the best of the three but the intestines had some smell. Otherwise overall too salty."}
{"text":"We went to Ichiban's for lunch. For appetizers my wife and I ordered spring rolls. They were hot and crisp, but bland. For my entree I ordered twice cooked pork and my wife had crispy spicy chicken. My pork was a very solid entree. Nice ginger undertones to a spicy mix of veggies and thinly sliced pork. The sauce was a little thin in flavor, but the pepper flakes have a nice kick. My wife's chicken was inundated with hot peppers. The chicken was good, but could have been better with a sauce. Overall a very solid meal."}
{"text":"Awesome spicy beef noodle soup! Sichuan food is one of my favorite kind of authentic Chinese food"}
{"text":"So I came to Madison hoping against hope that there would be a Chinese restaurant I could at least stomach. (Coming from a Chinese family, after living in California and visiting Taiwan every year... you get the picture.)   Imagine my surprise when the first Chinese place I go to is GREAT! My mom and I were both impressed. We had a great time talking to the two male waiters, who are both from the same hometown in China as my mom. Be prepared for the food to be spicy, but if you like that- this is the place for you.  Here's what I have tried so far, and every single one I fully endorse: -Sichuan Style Cucumber Appetizer -Spicy Stir Fried Green Beans -Twice Cooked Pork with Black Curded Bean and Pepper -Chicken with Three Pepper -Sliced Fish with Salted Mustard Cabbage (it's a soup, don't be surprised, but IT'S SO GOOD. really spicy though.)  But everything is worth a try! Packed on weekend nights (with Chinese!), but the place is big so no worries."}
{"text":"The Chinese food there is authentic to me a native Chinese, however there are some downside that just balance the good part out.   1. The service is bad. Water didn't get refilled. The rice came long after the entree.  2. I find the chicken pork there are in normal quality, but not the beef! I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup on the other day. The beef cubes were very hard to chew, seem to come from the bone junctions or who-knows-where parts of a cow (hoofs or intestines?). It tasted like the elastic band. I could even see the white artery tubes sticking out of the meat. Yak."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese delivery. It was a little greasier than I usually like but it was still good. It's a decent amount of food as well.   Delivered in about an hour which was fine and got everything right in the order"}
{"text":"Sichuan is a region in China known for hot babes. If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the whole package. Pretty and smart gets it done. Taking one without the other you're either shallow or a chump.  You'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.  So what kind of babe is Ichiban? Obviously she's the brainy one that doesn't care what you think. I kinda wish she did, though."}
{"text":"Our experience at Ichiban Sichuan on a Friday evening (early-ish), was...in a word...annoying.   The service is the main reason this place is just two stars for me. The food would get three or four stars.  The decor of this place is a bit tacky, and it was pretty cold inside - I don't think it was well insulated. Several of the people that were eating there kept on their coats. Also, the music they were playing when we first came in included a slow-piano and violin version of the Happy Birthday song and other weird versions of cheesy songs. Not the coolest.   Our waitress was very nice and clearly wanted to please us, but unfortunately it didn't turn out right. First, she started us off with two glasses of water - one of which had a lipstick print on the side and clearly had not been washed. It made me wonder about the attentiveness to cleanliness there. She apologized and replaced the water glass quickly, however.  Then, having recently gone on a diet, I asked whether or not it was possible to get Kung Pao chicken NOT-fried.  She said yes, of course, nodding her head vigorously.  When the dish came (in pretty good time, I guess), the chicken was indeed fried.  My BF and I had ordered both the Kung Pao Chicken dish and the spicy green beans dish to share, which we made clear to the waitress. But the spicy green beans came out about 40 minutes afterwards. I was afraid we wouldn't even have time to eat it. While we were waiting for that dish, we had asked our waitress to check on it twice, which she said she did and that they were working on it in the kitchen.  And this is probably the most picky comment, but several of the waitresses (younger ones, ours included) were literally running around the place when a larger crowd came. They looked extremely stressed out.  I'm not sure if there was some unique situation happening behind the scenes, or if they had just hired a bunch of new wait staff, but it stressed me out seeing them so stressed out.  Anyway, I might get delivery from them in the future, but the in-person experience left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this restaurant. We ordered 3 dishes and the first came rather quickly. The eggplant with garlic sauce had really thick skin so it probably wasn't fresh. After we finished the first dish and the rice has gone cold, they still haven't served the other 2 dishes. They served several other tables that arrived after us. After we asked the waitress 3 times, they finally served the last two dishes. The beef was very salty and quite dry. Both the food and experience were disappointing."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Chinese food,  this is the place to go. Many of the staff do not speak English. So when I explained to our waitress, I had never been there and asked for recommendations, she pointed to the back of the menu and said, this is American!    My \"American\" Chinese food was indeed that. Nothing spectacular and somewhat bland - well, I did request it not be spicy. Service was short and somewhat slow. However looking at menu, they boast a wide array of dishes such as rabbit, frog, chicken feet, duck and other not typical \"american\" food. The table next to us was enjoying an intestine and fish soup."}
{"text":"On the one hand, this is the best Chinese place in Madison. It's one of the few places where you can get Chinese food that isn't smothered in a sickly sweet sauce, without going back to the kitchen and talking to the chef.  On the other hand, the sichuan dishes are all missing the sichuan peppercorns that give them their characteristic málà flavor.  Overall, solid, but not great, Chinese food."}
{"text":"For once, a recommendation for a Chinese restaurant in Madison came through for me.  The food at Ichiban is not the best Chinese that I've ever had, but it's certainly at a different level from what you might find in Madison.    We went and had a vermicelli with minced pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and the spicy chicken dish.  The spicy chicken dish was very good if you like some heat in your food.  I found the eggplant with garlic sauce somewhat oily, but it went well with some rice.  This place is the best Chinese I've had in Madison.  It's rather pricey, but it's not your typical Chinese takeout food and it's worth it.  Come here if you want to expand your culinary experience of Chinese food to more than just General Tso' chicken and orange chicken and be prepared to enjoy some spice."}
{"text":"I chose this place because of the review level and they deliver.  I chose a $20 entree for lunch, \"Cocktail Shrimp with Chili Sauce\" .  The shrimp still have their heads and shells on.  Who eats \"Cocktail Shrimp\" with their full shell and heads??? this is disgusting and a total waste of my $20.  No where on the menu does it say that these are unpeeled shrimp.  Its a bummer because i'm freaking starving but do not eat shrimp heads or legs and these are too messy to peel.   Not for an American Audience for sure, at least tell us the shrimps are not peeled.  ICK.  Note:  i edited the review because the manager personally contacted me, and YELP refunded my money.   The sauce tasted good but I'm not going to be eating shrimp shells."}
{"text":"Since Orient House went downhill, I'm looking for a new delivery option. I won't pretend to have a sophisticated taste - I order General's chicken, chicken/mixed veggies, and spring rolls.   Judging from the other reviews, Ichiban Sichuan has some great dishes, but my boring stuff isn't among them."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese food I've had since leaving the Bay Area.  Totally authentic."}
{"text":"Japanese name, but good Chinese food! I went here with a group of 6 on a Friday night and was seated right away. The first thing that struck me about the menu was the variety of ingredients and also the number of different ways they prepared pork intestine. Our curiosity was piqued so when we asked the waitress about the intestine she was very helpful and recommended the crispy style. We ordered the cumin beef, ma po tofu, lamb with ginger and scallions, pan fried fish, and spicy crispy pork intestine. All of them were very good and, with the exception of the lamb and fish, pretty spicy. A few of my friends needed tissues to deal with their spice-induced runny noses. Anyway, I came out stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey, but I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ive gotten take out from here quite a few times. This is the most authentic Chinese food I've had in Madison so far. They offer Americanized food too like sesame chicken, but I'm a fan of the spicy crispy chicken and the pig stomach in chili sauce.  Do you like bacon? Try twice cooked pork"}
{"text":"Fried rice was pretty damn good! Chili chicken was ok, more peppers than chicken but that's typically the norm.   The delivery guy was an ass. Stood at the door then started yelling for a tip. Had he not shown out he would've received one."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Actually some of the best Chinese/Sichuan I've had in the Midwest.  I stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend midday during the week and stopped back a few days later for carry out.  The interior is quite large and I can't imagine there would ever be much of a wait for a table.  Service was quick and friendly enough.  Prices were reasonable and we were both quite pleased with our meals - and looked forward to the leftovers.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, like going to China while staying in Madison. We were the only Westerners eating there on a recent weekend evening after a Badgers game, but it was full! The food is fantastic, service is good - not cheap but well worth it. Make sure to order some veggie dishes as many of the meat dishes are a bit heavy and oily."}
{"text":"The Americanized dishes are bland and uninspired.  But the true ethnic Chinese dishes are decent.  I've yet to find good Chinese in Madison but this place is probably the best of what there is."}
{"text":"So yummy..went there twice and love it...intestines is my fav...chicken in oil appetizer is also delish...never had it before ever.  A great place in Madison...I hope they stay around."}
{"text":"When it's late on a Monday night and you don't want to venture out onto the snowy roads, there is always takeout and Ichiban was our pick. I went with the spicy and crispy chicken and my girlfriend opted for the wonton soup. The s/c chicken was interesting.  It doesn't come with a sauce (basically popcorn chicken bites) but the seasoning and breading was excellent.  You can't miss the floral heat from the sichuan peppercorns and the amount of hot pepper that was left was impressive.  The spiciness was not overbearing but definitely had a zip. The soup was also solid.  The broth was well made and flavorful and the wontons did not suffer from the gumminess that is often the case. Definitely think I need to return and try other dishes.  Fair warning: the menu is humongous so it may be a little tough at first to decide what to go for."}
{"text":"*Review for takeout only*  3.5 stars but there is no \"half\" option on Yelp. My friends have ordered here a couple of times. I would say that that the food is definitely Szechuan stile and full of spices and chili peppers, which I love.   Things that we have tried are: fried oxtail, ox tongue, lo mein and another type of noodle, szechaun beef, kung pao chicken, and Szechuan beef. The first time we ordered, the food took a very very long time to come, but the second time was more reasonable (maybe 45 minutes or so?). I do appreciate that they do delivery though, so not a huge deal. My friend is an adventurous eater and recommended the oxtail and tongue and they were actually very well done. Very tasty.  Everything is deliciously spicy but very very oily, so keep that in mind; you will definitely not feel great afterwards. I would say that the more Szechuan dishes were all delicious and probably a 5/5 stars. The more \"Americanized\" dishes (such as lo mein, chicken, etc.) were mediocre at best, so this is not the place to go if this is the type of Chinese food you're looking for.   I think really, for me, the reason why it is only around 3.5 stars is because the portions are very small for the prices (for $15 an entrée, about half of the entrée was just chili peppers for several of them each time). Things may be different in the restaurant perhaps, so don't let my review stop you from trying it out if you like big, bold spices!"}
{"text":"I would give the taste a 4 star at least. However not long after eaten here, my wife was sick within hours. It was obviously food poisoning. Would I come back again? Probably. But definitely not ordering the same dish again. Still a die hard spicy food fan."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now through the past 4 years and each time has gotten worse. I first came here about 4 years ago during our drive to Chicago. The food was solid and delicious. The water boiled fish was spicy and very flavorful. Each year, I would stop by. When I stopped by 2 years ago, noticed the restaurant underwent some remodel and taste didn't feel the same as the first couple times I went. It was lacking flavor.   This time I went, we got the dan dan noodles, water boiled fish and spicy schezuan dumplings. It was very disappointing. It was completely lacking flavor. The dan dan noodles were too strong on the peanut side. Schezuan dumplings were tasteless even though it was drenched in chili oil. The water boiled fished was also not really spicy and had not much flavor as well.   This place has gone down hill over the years and I'm sad. It used to be really good, but it seems maybe they underwent some different ownership or maybe different chefs over the year. I probably won't be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"All the food we ordered was delicious as always and prepared with great quality and seasoning. The food was served to us very quickly, in mere minutes, much faster than most dine in restaurants. The price was a bit on the expensive side for a Chinese restaurant by the quality of the food easily matched the price. Overall, one of the best restaurants in Madison!"}
{"text":"glad to see Park st on the up and up! This place is good, but a little overpriced IMO."}
{"text":"Protip: Do not wear a white shirt when you go to eat here. Cause it's chili peppers and hot sauce galore and you will get some on your shirt.  I love coming here for their lunch specials. $7.50 for about 30 different items.   I have had the L17 which is Noodle w/ spare ribs and chili sauce. It is served as a soup dish even though it doesn't list as a soup. Every bite you take your mouth will be coated in chili flakes. If that's your thing awesome, I guess it's sorta my thing. I love the spiciness, maybe not the constant choking though. The L14 Noodle with Hot special beef. It is very similiar, noodles in soup, some veggies, and cilantro (love the cilantro touch!). I think I prefer this dish because the cuts of beef seem a little bigger and more satisfying. The other dish with the spare ribs can be a little cumbersome.  The twice cooked pork is basically bacon. Lots and lots of bacon in chili sauce. I love bacon. But I felt guilty eating this much bacon.   The sichaun style cucumber is a refreshing appetizer. Cool and crunchy but spicy snack.  I've enjoyed most items here but the two dishes that I've gotten that I would probably pass on next time would be the walnut shrimp. This dish is a bout 15 or 16 dollars and was medicore. The broccoli was simply steamed with no spices and the shrimp is coated in like sweet and sour chicken batter but there were only a few pieces. The scallion pancakes appetizer wasn't particularly amazing, I've had better.  I hope to go there one day with about 2 other people to do their hot pot! It should be a lot of fun I think. And they allow you to split the pot into two broths. One spicy and one regular."}
{"text":"Hands down the best in the Midwest. do yourself a flavor and try the chicken shrimp with walnuts."}
{"text":"I'm a Taiwanese who's kinda critical of Chinese food, but this one totally satisfied my taste bud!!! To me, ICHIBAN and FUGU are the only two authentic Chinese restaurants in the entire Madison city (the next-door Orient House is okay but the facilities are too old). In addition to its delicious, big portion food, it's much more spacious than FUGU so it's quite relaxing and comfy to dine in. No worries if you have a big group of six or more. I'm sure they have ample spaces for it.. more than you could imagine! By the way, it has the softest white rice I've ever had in Madison.. so touched!!!   Really love this place! Hope it will sustain as long as I'm here..lol"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but not outstanding. Its definitely overpriced for what you're getting. For ~8 dollars, I got what looked like a handful of General Tso's pork. The double cooked pork was stir fried bacon. Ox tongue and tripe was made well, but they used too much of a spice that numbed your mouth and made things taste sour. Service was good at first; we were seated in a nice place and given water, but after that it went downhill. Waiters weren't very friendly, seeming almost cold and our empty cups went largely ignored. When cashiers and waiters weren't busy talking to each other, they were playing on their phones or standing around. The decor was fancy at least. I think I can forget about giving Ichiban a third chance."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. It was good. The curry tasted like curry. The pad Thai tasted like pad Thai. We also ordered the sliced pork in garlic sauce. Now that tasted amazing!!! I would love to try some of the very ethnic sounding dishes but alas we are from DC and will be leaving in a couple days. All in all the delivery was quick and the food was good. I will be dreaming of the sliced pork for a while."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The Sichuan dishes on their menu are full-on spicy, so you have been warned. One of my favorite dishes is their chili garlic eggplant. It's medium spicy and has a delicious garlicky flavor. I've ordered online twice and picked up my food and eaten at the restaurant once. The food comes out super quick (about 5 minutes) but  doesn't taste like they took any short cuts. They have a huge menu, so it might be hard to make a choice, but any choice you make is bound to be delicious."}
{"text":"Ichiban Sichuan just rocketed to the top as my favorite Asian restaurant in Madison.  I have had the Spicy Green Beans, General Tso's Chicken, Red Curry and Pad Thai and ALL of them were amazing.  I cannot tell you how excited I was to find this place.  I feel like I have been searching through all of the Asian restaurants in Madison and have finally found a solid winner."}
{"text":"Lunch. The restaurant is almost empty. 10 min after we order - one main dish arrives. My order cannot be made - so they asks me to pick something else. The soup and appetizer doesn't show up yet.....lets see.... The food was good tho - so I give them 3 and not 2 ( for bad service)"}
{"text":"Great Sichuan. Try the fish in yellow pepper. Comes under a mound of dried red pepper, like many dishes here. The effect is as numbing as it is spicy. Many dishes can be oily, but that's where the flavor is."}
{"text":"I'm giving their food  5 stars and their service 1 star. They only know a little bit of English and they did not seem happy about answering questions on the menu. They also did not check on us, I had to look for them twice to ask for napkins and a fork. No friendly smiles. My husband and I ordered 3 dishes: cumin lamb, three chili chicken and generals chicken. I'm  from San Francisco and Ive tried some real authentic chineese food over there and this food is just like that, the real thing! Glad I found this place but I hope they can improve on their service."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food in Madison.  Huge menu that focuses on extremely spicy Sichuan cuisine (yes they use the real peppercorns).  Almost as good as the Sichuan food I can find in LA.  Best dine in and have a hot pot for the real experience."}
{"text":"The food is my favorite Chinese in Madison. I always seem to find something new to order that never fails to impress. The food is great and one order always amounts to a full second meal. That said, definitely get take out or delivery. We dined in once and that was enough. Interior is really uncomfortable, has an odd layout, and is unattractive. There always seem to be lots of staff moving about the place but not really paying that much attention to customers."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese in Madison. Eaten here twice with a large group, which is the best way to go. Love the atmosphere in here. The back room--which felt rather cafeteria-like a couple years ago--has been redone to make it feel more intimate with deep red walls and wood pagoda-like features. Bathrooms are chilly but lovely. Menus have been redone, with a page in back that has \"American Chinese.\"   About the food: the only trouble with ordering in a group is that I don't have a great idea of what all we ordered! The chilled garlic string beans are one of my favorites. The scallion pancakes were overdone this time. The three kind of dumplings dish were okay. The star of our table was a spicy fried chicken-red pepper dish--this time we knew enough to order two. The fish dishes are very different from how I've eaten fish--both were in a broth--but were very good. I'm not an eggplant fan, but two others at the table raved. A cold noodle dish was surprisingly bland but offset the burn of the chicken-pepper dish. The rice was perfect, as was the green tea and water.   I appreciated the attentive staff, who helped our table with two high chairs and was very conscientious of hot dishes coming anywhere near young ones."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had a take out order of Kung Pao Chicken Chinese style extra hot. They were able to crank it out in about 5 minutes!  They gave large portions that made for easily two meals, I would definitely recommend at least giving it a shot."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch the other day and I must say that I really like this place.   The food rivals those in China Town  Chicago, such as Laos Schezuan.  They have both  lunch and dinner menu and we ordered from the dinner menu.  Our waiter was a man in his forties and was helpful with offering recommendations from the menu.   We ordered crispy chicken, ox tongue, and a spicy fish dish.  All were wonderful and spicy and we ended up with leftovers to take home.  Spicy is 7.5 out of 10."}
{"text":"After seeing the mixed reviews, I felt it would at least be alright, but when it had been over an hour since I placed my delivery order less than 10 blocks I started to worry. When the food finally arrived, it was cold, bland, and very oily.  I ordered the kung pao chicken, the chicken fried rice, and potstickers hoping to have enough food for a day or two. The potstickers were good, the kung pao was good in flavor, but extremely oily, and the rice was just kind of strange and very bland with very little veggies and chicken. Overall a disappointment for $30."}
{"text":"Stopped in while passing through Madison. Definitely not your ordinary food court Chinese food. The menu is much more authentic and has an overwhelming amount of options. It reminds me of Hong Kong Noodle, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants back in Minneapolis. All of the dishes looked and smelled salty and delicious, just what I was craving.   My girlfriend and I were able to order off the lunch specials menu which featured many popular items from the menu at a very decent price. We split an order of Kung Pao Chicken, and also an order of Red Curry Chicken. The dishes came out fast and looked mouthwatering. The Kung Pao Chicken had a lot of flavor and included peanuts (one of my favorite parts) and some sort of chile but no other vegetables. The chicken seemed poor quality. It felt a little mushy and slightly slimy. I don't think it tasted as good as it looked, I got a little sick of that dish by the end. The red curry chicken was not fried and the the chicken looked and tasted of much better quality. The curry came with the chicken along with an assortment of vegetables all covered in the red curry sauce. The curry tasted good but lacked enough flavor, I thought the dish could have been a little more powerful. Those are my favorite curries. It was a good cheap lunch if you're looking for some Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"I am very pleased to have this place in my neighborhood.  And my bf and I probably ordered the right things - sounds like what you order decides 5 star vs 1 star.   Knowing that they are Sichuan restaurant, we ordered Cold mushroon (Enoki) in spicy sauce, Cold eggplant in spicy sauce, and the house speciality - Fish in spicy sauce. All of them were EXCELLENT - and I mean it.   To me, the biggest selling point was their use of right spices. That clearly differentiated Ichiban from other Americanized grease-heavy crap I see in Madison. I felt like this is the food they'd eat, and that definitely translated in the menu."}
{"text":"After trying a whole bunch of restaurants (most more than once) in Madison for two years, this is the best Chinese restaurant in madison in my opinion. Other places do have some great dishes, but the overall menu are not as strong as Ichiban.   We dined in and ordered delivery for more than 20 times (possibly 30), tried various dishes including several new ones, and they rarely disappoint. But since we never order the Americanized dishes, I cannot speak for those.  As for the service problem mentioned in some comments, I personally find it to be pretty standard restaurant service in a Chinese restaurant. Granted, the waitresses do not make small talks or try their best to take care of you or put on smily faces, but they take the orders, deliver food in time and refill your water constantly, which is quite enough for me.  The restaurant is not perfect, for instance some dish can be oily, lighting in some area is poor, and some dish can arrive late or not cooked as perfect every single time. I am giving 5 stars only because in comparison to other restaurants in madison that are way worse and are getting 3 or 4 stars, it deserves it."}
{"text":"Literally the best Chinese restaurant in Madison, in my honest opinion. The tofu pot and fuqi feipian, are two of the best dishes I've ever had at any Chinese restaurant, and trust me that says something."}
{"text":"This place truly is A-OK, the quintessential 3 star dining spot. I'm a grad student and our lab got together to say goodbye to a visiting Chinese professor. We called ahead for a larger table (we had 10 in our party) and were seated in the back. It was really quiet and a decent sized table to where we weren't bumping elbows with each other. There were many big tables open in the back, but it was probably good we called ahead to warn them of a larger party coming in.  Waters, small plates, chopsticks, and napkins were already set out for us when we arrived. Forks came quickly by request (I didn't need one I swear... okay maybe for rice but that's it). The menu is extensive, divided by protein with an American Chinese food section in the back (including a pad Thai dish, was curious about that one at a Chinese restaurant).  Dishes came out as they were ready so food runners were bringing dishes to our table periodically. We all ordered an item, and everything was served communally with a huge bowl of rice for us all to share. The lazy Susan style was a fun way to dine together (where does that name come from, by the way? who is Susan...).  The food was all A-OK. The mapo tofu was super good. The tofu with mushrooms was all tofu with maybe five mushroom slices, and the tofu wasn't very flavored in this dish. I'd get the straight up mushrooms next time. The shredded potato dish was unique and tasty. Water refills were frequent. Overall I enjoyed the dine-in experience here, but I'm not sure if I would hit up this spot for delivery."}
{"text":"The name is confusing but it's a Sze Chuan Chinese restaurant, meaning its best dishes are really spicy.  I'd say the food is comparable to Fugu. To be honest (and don't kill me!), I don't notice a huge difference.  BUT, I will say that Ichiban does a MUCH better boiled beef dish than Fugu. A seasoned Sze Chuan chef drops dead every time Fugu makes that dish. Kidding. Kind of. Ichiban's version tops Fugu's bastardized one every damn time.  So if you like boiled beef (and if you haven't tried it, go for it! Its Chinese name literally translates to \"water-boiled beef\" though that is SO misleading because it's jam-packed with spicy chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Be sure to drink some milk afterwards), go to Ichiban. Go out of your way to go to Ichiban. Other than that, if you have to choose between Fugu and Ichiban, go with whichever one is closer."}
{"text":"I have tried a bunch of things from here, and have never been disappointed! I love the tripe in chili oil!! Not you're typical americanized asian food. Great Sichuan food for a decent price. Don't order out though-- very expensive and food often comes cold. Better to eat in."}
{"text":"We were wanting real Chinese and this rocks! Friendly staff and good service. Try the potato strings in hot sauce appetizer. The tomato and egg and Hong Kong style seafood soups were uniquely flavorful. Order a bit of each and share. As another reviewer said this and Fugu Asian are the real deal. We will be back.  BTW, if you aren't adventurous there are plenty of items on the menu that can work for you."}
{"text":"I would definitely consider this some of the best Chinese food I've had in Madison (despite the confusing Japanese name?). My experience with takeout in the past has been pretty good as well, but like many other reviewers said before me, some of their spicier dishes can be quite oily.   I recently came here to eat in and was super impressed! Earlier last year, I found a Groupon for $40 of Ichiban for $20 and thought this was a perfect opportunity to eat here again (definitely check to see if Groupon is still selling this because it's a great deal!). I came with a party of 4 and we were seated right away at a booth. The pictures in the menu are really helpful if you don't read Mandarin, since the literal translations from Chinese to English don't translate well. We ended up ordering 4 dishes, with individual item reviews below.  - Tofu in Homemade Sauce: 5/5. Loved this! The sauce really is super tasty and very savory. The fried tofu was cooked perfectly, and there are different vegetables and Chinese black fungus in it as well. Highly recommend.  -Spicy String Beans: 4.5/5. Don't be fooled by the name - compared to a lot of other dishes they serve here, I really would not consider this as one of their spicy dishes despite all of the red color in the dish. The beans are a cool texture, crispy but not overdone. It is seasoned with larger salt grains, so you get a nice surprise sometimes!   - Beef With Ginger and Scallion: 5/5. Delicious. The beef is unbelievably tender and almost falls apart in your mouth. It has an incredible flavor and the scallion brings out everything even more. The ginger is subtle, and not overpowering.  - Braised pork: 4/5. All of the meat was marinated very well and this came with a lot of sauce, which is perfect to top rice with. I did think the sauce was a little too intense though - a little bit saltier and more sugary than I would have liked. This dish features fattier cuts of pork as well - super delicious if you like this cut!  In addition, the service and speed was unbelievable. Within 5-10 minutes of ordering, our first dish was already on the table and each one came out less than a few minutes afterwards. We came for dinner on a Thursday night, if that is helpful. Our waitress was very friendly as well. I would rate this a 4.5/5 if possible, -0.5 because of the prices if you don't have a coupon and for my previous take out experiences. Ichiban has definitely stepped up its game and I'd keep my eye out for this restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food. Delicious and huge portions. You'll definitely be taking a box home and coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Don't be fooled by the Japanese name...this place is a Chinese restaurant! It just so happens to be THE best Chinese food in Madison. This is a Sichuan style place, so make sure you stick to Sichuan dishes and you will be very happy. The service is so-so, but that's typical for a Chinese restaurant. This place doesn't get 5 stars because 1) It's way overpriced for Chinese food. $10-15/plate?! Are you kidding me? 2) The food is good, but not good enough to compare to decent Chinese food in other cities (ie Chicago, SF).   FYI, Fugu used to be really good, but the chef moved to Ichiban a while ago."}
{"text":"Had to doc Ichiban one star because they forgot the rice with my delivery order; however, I called the restaurant, they called the driver, and delivered the rice within 20 minutes.  I ordered the green beans with garlic...amazing!!! Unfortunately, they were a little cold when they arrive but still delicious. I also had the eggplant with chili sauce. Spicy and delicious!   I will definitely order from Ichiban again. Easy online ordering and quick delivery. Hopefully they won't forget the rice next time!"}
{"text":"I am so like it spicy food ,spicy crispy chicken.too many special food,if you like spicy food ,you will be come here try it .eggplant with chili garlic sauce .string bean ,"}
{"text":"Five stars for food, but no star for their service. It's all about attitude, especially in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Madison from Atlanta and was craving good Chinese food. This place really hit the spot.  Madison doesn't have a dedicated neighborhood known for Asian food (i.e Chinatown), so I wasn't sure where to look. I'm so relieved to have found this gem. It's authentic, spicy, Szechuan style food. While they do deliver, I definitely wouldn't put this place in the same category as a typical Chinese-American delivery/fast food place.  The steamed fish is especially good. If you don't enjoy spicy foods though, you probably won't enjoy this place.  I would recommend getting one dish per person and sharing family style (having your own rice bowl and sharing the other plates). I usually get three dishes for two people so I can have leftovers."}
{"text":"This review is based on Ichiban's delivery service, which was very disappointing.  We waited TWO HOURS for our food to be delivered, after being told it would take 45-60 minutes.  I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt at first, but after waiting an hour and a half, decided to call to inquire about our order.  The person we spoke with on the phone was very unprofessional and unhelpful.  They sounded confused about our order and hung up on us when we continued to ask if our food was out for delivery or not.  We eventually did receive our order, but it was not worth the hassle and long wait. I would not recommend ordering delivery from here."}
{"text":"Very authentic sichuan food. I got the mapo tofu, white chicken in chili oil, and spicy pork kidney. They could considering lowering their prices a bit, but the portions are substantial and the food is deliciousl"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. We went on a Friday evening and the place was packed, very hard to get waited on, staff was nice but very rushed. The food was so expensive for the quality. My veal came soaking in a 1/4\" of oil on the plate, veggies were so oily all you could taste was the oil. My friend had another veal dish that was full of bones and gristle. Each was around $16! We won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I have ever experienced. Almost the whole staff was on their phones! I was so mad because they didn't bother to come refill my water but yet they had time to chit chat and text! They definitely didn't receive any tip from me. Never going there again. Because of such bad service I wasn't even able to enjoy the food since I was so irritated."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from Ichiban, but since we discovered them, we've ordered probably once a week.  I'm definitely not able to speak to authenticity, but without reservation I will say the food is great.   I've been trying different things each time, and haven't had anything that I wouldn't order again!  The only constant in my order is potstickers, I think they're fantastic.   Delivery time for 3.5 miles away is stellar.  The last time I ordered (7pm on a Tuesday), I had my food in less than 20 minutes, which seemed ridiculously and awesomely fast.  I also appreciate the option to order online!"}
{"text":"Spicy crispy chicken is one classic dish that we order almost every single time from Ichiban. I'd say to be careful of the this dish if you can't handle spicy food but if you're looking for a dish to wow your palette, then this is the one to try!   I ordered some beef noodle soup and that came out in a giant bowl full of beef and noodles. The dumplings we ordered as appetizers was also equally as delicious. Overall, Ichiban really has some authentic Sichuan Chinese food. There's bond to be something on the menu that you'll like!"}
{"text":"Very good sichuan food.  I ordered the spicy crispy chicken and was not disappointed.  The chicken was cooked well and not dried out.  The outside was crispy and flavorful.  The chili's in the dish added a nice heat.  I'd definitely recommend.  I ordered delivery and the food arrived on time.  If you are looking for a nice change of pace from your classic Asian dishes, give this place a try.  Their sichuan style food is on point."}
{"text":"The most memorable Chinese resturant I've ever had in US!! Witness every sweet moment I spent"}
{"text":"one of the best Chinese food in Madison area! The spicy dishes are great and truly  spicy!"}
{"text":"Having been using this place as a to-go restaurant since about 3 years ago. The food is okay, w/ most spicy stuff. However, the flavor is too much determined by the sauce they are using and almost all spicy dishes share the same sauce! Also, the menu has not been updated since DAY 1 they opened (was it in 2011???), gee!  Side note, the owner also has a same restaurant opened around Purdue University campus, which is the same taste with the same menu..."}
{"text":"It's funny that the 'Americanized' dishes, like General Tso, are buried in the menu on a page toward the back.  Ichiban is 5* for me because it is so rare to find such vivid, diverse, exciting food, exactingly prepared (and the extensive lunch menu is a great price).  Today the hot and sour soup was far more hot than sour - - very spicy; and loaded with chunky goodness.  It was an extra $1.75 in addition to the $7.50 lunch special ma po tofu, but this is way above average fare, so it is fitting that the lunch special isn't the standard 'Americanized' eggroll/eggdrop/entree ritual.   It wasn't the top ma po tofu I've had, but a solid second.  This follows on a dinner a couple months back, with 7 of us sharing some of the more interesting dishes on the menu,  and they were MOST interesting.  Virtually nobody liked the beef tendon with chili sauce appetizer, but I thought it was one of the most fascinating and extreme things i've ever had - - the thin slices of tendon were like pappardelle noodles, but the concoction was stunning sensually - - it effectively numbed the mouth - - textures like nothing else - - it was like opium for the palate.   Only a couple people enjoyed the fish soup dish, but I thought it was knockout, and so pleased that I could take the vast amount that was left untouched home.   And the dry braised mixed mushroom in spicy hot pot - - intoxicating.  The more standard dishes we shared were, well, more standard.  Ichiban offers fascinating, exciting dishes, prepared with great care and precision, covering a flavor palate that most of us never encounter.  (And since it is Sichuan-centered, the dishes can have some serious heat, but also a mellow numbing character).   This will put off some people,  but it should intrigue others a whole lot.   Really worthwhile."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Had the spicy, crispy chicken. It was good. I just have a couple of caveats. First, there was no sauce. The picture I saw suggested a sauce accompanying the dish. I still liked it , I just added sriacha. Secondly there are no veggies in the dish, just a mass amount of chili peppers. I don't mind spice, in fact I love it and I consumed all my chicken, I just didn't see the purpose of one pound of chili peppers. Picture to follow. I will go again because I liked my food and the service was decent. Looking forward to trying one of their hot pots."}
{"text":"I just found out about Ichiban, and looking at the menu, I was SO excited to try it out.  There are very few good chinese restaurants in madison, and after ordering take out, Ichiban is at the top of my list.  The menu is ridiculously huge with tons of inventive dishes you won't see on anywhere else.  We had the general Tso chicken, and the dumplings, which were both delicious.  We also had the greens and tofu soup, which was a bit bland, but was healthy and filling.  The dandan noodles: overcooked and a bit slimy.  Maybe we just got them on an off day, since every other review says they are delicious.  I can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Chinese food! The portions are large and easy to share with the whole family. My family doesn't like very spicy food, but if you ask, you can ask how spicy it is or to make it mild. Our family had the beef hibachi, fried rice, and steamed/stir fry vegetables. It was all very good! There are a lot of dishes to choose from. The service isn't the best-- not what you would suspect from a typical restaurant. Though, we got in, ordered food, and got it right away, so it's not much of a problem. Parking is an issue; we weren't sure where to park and parking in front of the restaurant is prohibited from 4-6 M-F.   I would visit again!"}
{"text":"The driver said we were 22 miles from them thats why it took 2 hours for delivery. However, we are 17 min 7.8 miles from door to door..Cashew chicken was garlic flavored, chicken tasted not fresh. Appetizer vegetable dumpling is bland filled with what tasted like greens of some sort? no taste. The order did not come with any sauces such as soy. Chicken and Shrimp TSO is ok, large chunks. Mongolian beef was fair. Smoothies were all good, but order was all mixed up.  We ordered online. No one calls u to confirm or informs u of any delays. It was snowing but not a blizzard."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in town. Very authentic food, and very caring service. -- from a native Chinese"}
{"text":"GO TO THE ORIENT HOUSE NEXT DOOR....Had the double cooked pork and instead of pork it was bacon. I don't know if they forgot which type of pork is usually used but it was very disappointing. I recommend next door instead."}
{"text":"It's so sad that my third time coming here is not a good experience. It was okay, not fantastic when I came here for the first and second time. But today, when I was really craving for some hotpot, I decided to have it here. It is during the lunch time but the restaurant still has way too many empty seats. The waitress speaks very limited English so I can't ask her for some explanation on some menu. We were given two glasses of water: one for me, the other for my hubby. Just when I wanted to drink, I was surprised to learn the glass is super dirty which made me think they didn't wash it. I asked the waitress to change it and she didn't say sorry at all. And it's been twenty minutes and more but I don't think our order will come anytime soon. And oh, the butterflies seem to be regulars too for this place. While the overall place is not dirty, I was wondering why this place doesn't mind having some butterflies flying around the customer's tables. My hubby's Thai tea came after 25 minutes we ordered our food. I can't wait to write this review as I don't remember the last time I ever had a very bad experience with a restaurant. Won't be back anytime soon. Maybe next year or so. And we had to pay 56. Tips not included. Such a waste."}
{"text":"On Christmas Eve, the four of us ordered 2 appetizer and 4 dishes to take out, and 3 (1 Chinese and 2 Americans who have strong body and healthy eating habits) of us got food poisoned at night, we all threw up and felt nausea, two us of had fever for a night, it was soooo terrible that it ruined our Christmas holiday.  This is the only time we got FOOD POISONED during last 3 Will never visit again. Please be careful with the food safety here."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I cannot believe I ate at the same place as some of these people.  First of all, we had planned to eat at The Orient House, which we love, but it was closed for remodeling.  I remember reading good reviews on Ichiban, and it is right down the street, so we decided to try it.  Very weird dining experience.  We were seated, then the waiter came and Friend #1 placed her order.  The waiter started to walk away even though myself and another friend had not placed an order.  He seemed confused that we all wanted to order.  Friend #1 ordered spring rolls and potstickers, Friend #2 ordered Pad Thai and I ordered spring rolls, Indonesian Fried Rice with tofu and hot tea.  Spring rolls were not the best I have eaten (that would be Curry in the Box) but potstickers were good.  Then my fried rice came out, very little tofu and what was there was kind of rubbery.  Nothing special on the taste.  Friend #2 shared my rice until we tracked down our waiter and asked about the Pad Thai.  Ooops, the order did not get placed, nor did the hot tea ever come out.  The whole thing was very strange.  I think we will stick to The Orient House when it re-opens.  Hopefully, soon!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to good Chinese lunch so after driving by the Jade Palace down the street (scary) decided to try Ichiban.  Had to park on side street and walked past dumpster behind restaurants...disgusting smells and almost lost my appetite but pressed onward.  Girls were very nice.  Had hot/sour soup which was very good but some of the vegetables not cooked through.  Ordered orange pork,  broccoli on plate was ice cold, meat very flavorful but then came the long black hair in the food.   not mine, girls offered to comp soup which was nice but left hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time in Madison and for some odd reason I felt a tingling need to satisfy my urge for spicy Asian food on this cold Friday evening.  I chose Ichiban based on online reviews such as this and the fact that their menu offered such oddities that other restaurants wouldn't dare to offer.  I figured, this place ought to be great if they can offer these on their menu!  Items such as intestine, tripe, and duck tongue just to name a few.  Besides, I'm sick of those \"Chinese buffet\" style food.  I craved originality and unique taste and flavor.    I wanted everything on the menu!  However, just looking at the prices and what I have in my wallet , I figured it wasn't a good idea to order much so I decided to phone in my order of Hot and Spicy Beef and Hot and Sour Seafood soup.  The first attempt of calling was unsuccessful; I received a generic voicemail.  The second attempt fared better.  I was greeted by a noisy background and eventually a lady who seemed to be very polite.  In the midst of giving my order, she started yelling something in her native language.  Nonetheless, she repeated my small order back to me and asked me to come in 35 minutes to pick up my order due to it being very busy.  I hesitantly agreed.  35 minutes later passed by and I'm at the register watching the waiters and waitresses dart back and forth.  I kid you not, they are running back and forth carrying food.  Not just 1 or 2 staff members, ALL of them are running around!  Cups are being held with fingers inside of them so they're able to hold more while they run.  Bowls and plates of food are not served on a serving tray so they're just running back and forth from the kitchen to tables.  Aye aye aye!  This was a sight to be seen I tell ya!  They must have this down to an exact science as there were not a drop or spill anywhere during this circus fest!  The biggest kicker was that they never made my food yet.  I waited around for an additional 30 minutes for them to keep telling me it's being prepared.  30 minutes is not an estimate either, I timed it on my cell phone from arrival to seeing it placed on the takeout table as there were nowhere for me to sit while I waited.  Of course, one of the staff member invited me to sit next to another dining patron 20 minutes into my wait, however, I politely declined.  I wonder, If I phoned in my order previously and it took an hour to get to me, were they an hour behind on all food orders?    Ahh, I finally have my food with me but with no included utensils or napkins. This is where I tell you that all this waiting was worth it.   Yep, you guessed it.  I would've gotten the same satisfaction with Wendy's spicy chicken nuggets.  The Hot and Spicy Beef were served cold in a pool of red chili garlic oil.  The $9 Hot and Sour seafood soup was just your measly Chinese buffet style hot and sour soup with 1, yes 1 baby shrimp and 4 squid and a 3 imitation crab leg piece.  This was an utter disappointment.  I ended up rinsing off the beef with water because it was soaked in oil and throwing half of the hot and sour soup away because there were no other edibles in it.  No tofu, no mushroom, nor bamboo shoots.  No pun intended but this entire experience left me with a hot and sour taste in my mouth.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone considering there are many other choices in the same vicinity.  Thank you all for reading and happy eating!"}
{"text":"Tried 2 new dishes tonight. The Cumin Flavored Beef with Chili Sauce, and the Fried Shredded Beef in Chili Sauce. Both were excellent! The fried was slightly more spicy.  The Cumin Beef was very fragrant with cumin, but the flavor was not overwhelming. Just right. The Fried beef was small strips, coated in chili seeds, with lots of the dried red chilies on the platter, and Sichuan peppercorns. Very yummy!   We were sweating by the time we were done eating, so my craving for spicy this evening was hit right on the spot!  Gotta love it when a craving is satisfied! I would recommend both dishes. I would also like to slip in a comment here about the staff.  Every single time we've been there, they have been absolutely excellent.  They have been very helpful, and answered all our questions, and took the time to tell us their favorite dishes. .  Couldn't ask for better!   We are now recognized as soon as we walk in, and they even remember what we usually order, and put it in for us as soon as we walk in, if we confirm that is what we want.  Our previous wait staff always makes a point to stop by & say \"Hi\" if they are not waiting on us that night   We just love going there!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to get back, I did find a house in the neighborhood and I have found some 'good taste' food around town. My S.U. and I had to abort a fish fry excursion at the last minute and I knew she would love this place. Her comment was, \"This was the first place you ate in Madison and it took you this long to come back??!!?\". This is clearly one notch above anything else in Madison. The menu covers many classics and even a few non-Chinese dishes. The decor is open, no kitsch. The place is big so you'll always get seated. Reasonable drink prices. What's not to love?  This night we tried the scallion pancakes, the cumin beef, salt and pepper squid and a sautee spinach. The cumin beef was great, solid spice but not overpowering. The squid (not spicy) was served on a bed of puffed bean-thread noodles with bits of different colored sweet peppers, beautiful and tasty!  All the plates are quite large, we took half the stuff home, be warned. Bring friends so you can try more.  This place is Ichiban (!), in my book."}
