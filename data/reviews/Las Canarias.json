{"text":"The food here is superb. Lots of great choices on the menus, though most of the time I shamefully stick with the lamb--and it always arrives perfect. Also, the sangria is the best I've experienced in Calgary. I'm not surprised this restaurant is rated as one of the top 10 in Calgary."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok. There was only 1 server and my water was not topped up without my asking. The food was good though. The meat and cheese platter was good and so was the calamari. The shrimp was a little boring but the chocolate moose was delicious."}
{"text":"Went to Las Canaries on a Friday night with another couple. They have studied Spanish, and live in the NW, so they like to eat here for a culture boost (lacking in the north 'burbs).  They recommended the paella. The ladies began with cava, which was excellent. Then we ordered a bottle of red recommended by the restaurant. It was fantastic. Four of us shared a platter of appetizers - olives, bread, cheeses, chorizos, serrano ham, etc. It was very tasty  and we all had enough, although a bit more bread would have been great for some.  We also ordered the octopus on potato tapas. That was a real treat, something different and also tasty with a paprika flavour. My husband and I shared the paella with squid ink and seafood. It was full of seafood (lagostina, squid, octopus?, mussels, clams, prawns) and very tasty - although I would have liked a bit more salt. The other couple shared a paella with chicken, seafood and more of a tomato base. We tried each other's paellas and agreed we all liked the squid ink the best, although both were good.  The portions were huge, and my husband ate the leftover paella for lunch the next day. We were too stuffed to try dessert.The server brought us all mint drinks to finish our meal, which I thought was a nice touch. I would love to go back and try more tapas,with the excellent wine, and maybe have a dessert some evening. The service was friendly and responsive. We made reservations.The resto was not full on a Friday night.  The ambience is lovely, a perfect place for a romantic meal. It doesn't feel like a strip mall resto, and there was live music (keyboard). I especially appreciated that it was not loud. I could hear everyone, and I didn't have to shout - so rare these days. Our bill for 2 with appies, tapas, paella, and wine was $115 before tip, etc. That seems reasonable to me knowing the cost of imported cheeses & meats. I thought the portions were large. We ate from 6:30 to 9:30. Paella takes at least 40 minutes, but it didn't seem that long to me.  It gives you time to enjoy some tapas and apples before the main. I didn't find the service slow, but maybe because it was not busy (?) I don't mind taking my time when I'm eating good food and enjoying the company, so I didn't have any problem with the length of the meal - and I was not in a rush. I like the \"European\" approach to giving people time to eat and not interrupting every 5 seconds for an insincere inquiry into the food or asking if people want more drinks. I hope people try this resto because it would be a shame to lose a unique experience in the north end of the city - there's so little choice if you want something different. Slow down and pretend you are in Spain for a night! Food **** Ambience **** Service *****"}
{"text":"Las Canarias appears on John Gilchrist's list of \"Best New Restaurants of 2015\", and being that Gilchrist is a respected food & restaurant critic I figured I could trust his recommendation.  Arriving just after 6PM for dinner with my girlfriends, we started to study the menu - the mussels sounded amazing and just our luck they were on special! I also really wanted to try the paella and it does clearly state \"please allow 40 minutes\" so we quickly put an order in as we figured out what else we'd order. Deciding to go tapas style, we got the following: mussels, sizzling prawns, seared scallops and chicken breast (stuffed with cream cheese and serrano ham).  Warm bread was brought out to us as we waited for our food (perfect since we were all starving!), and when the mussels came out we asked for another order of bread so we could soak up the delicious sauce. Our prawns and scallops came out shortly after. The prawns were great! Actually sizzling in the mini cast iron pan it came in, swimming in a shaved garlic & white wine sauce. Scallops are usually my fave, these ones unfortunately were not. When I read \"seared\", I'm expecting a a golden crust - and these barely looked like they touched a hot pan. The fig reduction's sweetness was overwhelming - you didn't get the true flavor of the scallops, which was disappointing.  Out came our paella (which tasted as amazing as it looked!) and our chicken entrée, still sitting there was our (now cold) bowl of mussel sauce and no bread. Our server informed us that the kitchen was really busy and she'd bring us more bread when it came available.   At this point, I realized that there was only two people waiting all the tables and it was considerably busy.  Finishing what we could of the paella, our server finally brings us bread (it is now, maybe 8:15 pm)  We decide to try to get our bill, and had the hardest time trying to flag down either server. Once placed on the table, we all quickly pulled out our CCs and waited. And waited. And waited. And all decided just to head up to the bar to settle our bill and our server comments \"Oh, I could have taken care of these at the table!\" WHEN?!  By the time we'd all paid, it was just after 9PM. How have I been at dinner for 3 hours?? No bueno!  I think only the paella could draw me back, the exceptionally slow service killed my experience here.  Las Canarias - Do better! The common complaint on Yelp your pace of the service. John Gilchrist - Trust is gone, friends off"}
{"text":"Great options in the menu!  Tough choices.  There are a variety of flavours to suit any mood.  We will be back.  Service was very friendly and had great recommendations."}
{"text":"Terrific Spanish guitar play sets the mood as you walk in. The servers are well versed in everything on the menu. It definitely took me back to Spain except there they eat at 12:30 am. Here, we are in bed by 9:30.   Definitely would recommend for some wonderfully prepare tapas and I plan To check out 1/2 wine night with oysters so I can enjoy a bottle of Rioja wine."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! !! Out with the family and thought we would give this place a try. Little worried at first because we did not have reservation and the place looked expensive.  We decided to treat ourselves and take a chance. Thankful that we did!! The hostess was an absolute delight. We were seated within 20 minutes as we were told. The place was very busy but the service was still spot on. Our server was very nice. The food was simply outstanding.  I was totally impressed.  The portion sizes were huge (in my opinion) and the taste was spectacular. Prices were totally reasonable.  WE WILL BE BACK! Kids thought we were treated like royalty."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN TOWN!  I have been to this restaurant now numerous times,, both at this location and the previous location. We have never been disappointed.  Always happy when we leave.  Really , truly , cannot say enough about the ownership and management of this restaurant . The food and the service is always the same . EXCELLENT, CONSISTENT,  SUPERB!  There are far to many restaurants in this city that like to take advantage of their customers with substandard food,  ridiculous prices and joke portion sizes. THIS RESTAURANT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE ."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Went for a girls dinner and enjoyed our experience at this restaurant! Food was solid. We had the toast with crushed tomato, coconut shrimp,  potatoes brava and the beef, chicken, seafood paella. Also had half priced wine that day so we all win haha. Would like to return to try other dishes on their large menu. On the less busy side of 17th which helps for parking."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant 3 times, brings back memories of my life in Europe They try hard to accommodate us, specially my wife with garlic allergies"}
{"text":"Excellent food, relaxed atmosphere and attentive service made for a marvelous evening. I recommend this restaurant for a couple or a group."}
{"text":"First of all the service was excelent, and the food was delicious, we asked for Mixed Paella for the main meal and we ask for a few tapas olives and a good spanish wine to start, and everything was specially served and it tasted awesome and we didn't feel the time until the paella was ready which was absolutley delicious too. The place is really nice it have a long bar with tons of different beverages and the selection of wine is specially interesting if you like spanish wines and the kids had a really nice meal too. It's a nice place that you can enjoy with friends, family or for a special date."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding! The combination work perfectly together.  Went it was 1/2 price for a bottle of wine. It was a quiet evening. Waitress could have checked to see how everything was being that only had 2 tables. (Explained the menu well) will definitely go agin."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! I came to the restaurant recommended by a friend (both my friend and I are from Spain), and at beginning I was reluctant to go because it is very easy to compare the food to what I'm used to in my country. I've been in several \"Spanish\" restaurants and I always ended up disappointed. But not at all in this one.  We ordered: - Pulpo a la gallega (octopus) - Croquetas - Paella - Crema catalana and muse de chocolate as deserts  Both the octopus and the croquettes were amazing, they got the style and flavour from how they supposed to be. I had in Spain many times these dishes in many restaurants that are not even close to the quality that they got here. 10/10 The paella was good, and many people may complain about that it takes too long to be made, but if you get paella in less than half an hour, be scare because it can't be fresh. Here they take their time to make it right just for you. And the size was more than I needed, I finished eating so full!  The deserts were from another galaxy. Amazing deserts to complete the delicious meal.   To summary, if you wanna have the Spanish taste from the real Spain, go there, don't think it twice!!!"}
{"text":"Just like Cori B's review...I would 100% agree on everything. This place really needs to get it together if they want satisfied customers and customers to return.  I went with a client and even though it wasn't busy and not a weekend, the service was so SLOW. It was somewhat embarrassing only because I was with a client and when with clients you want everything to be great, even perfect. Kind of a nice steady flow of food and conversation. I found my client complaining allot to me on how slow things were and a place he wouldn't visit again knowing how long service takes. Between arriving and leaving we were there for 2.5+ hours and left disappointed on all fronts.  Items ordered:  A couple glasses of wine. Tapa: Olives Appie: Calamari Entrée's: Ahi Tuna and Beef Tenderloin  *They have an option to order a side (potato,rice, bread) but at $4.00 each on top of a $30 entrée doesn't make sense so skipped the \"extras\" ***   I am just glad my client suggested this place and is already a client, otherwise I am sure he wouldn't be my client anymore ;)  It's traditional Spanish cuisine and tapas, but the price point is really high for what you get. For these prices I would expect top notch service, food and most of all quantity. The food was good when it eventually showed up, but portions are small and for how long things took, not worth the wait. At times I felt bad for the staff, but when things take this long, the staff should be offering something free to tide you over while you wait for your food? Maybe more of those $6.00 Olive tapa's? Or maybe the manager should come by and check on the tables? Maybe some free Sangria while you wait and wait? No idea but not a place I would try if you are in a hurry or have to be some where in a few hours.  Sorry Las Canarias, really wanted to love this place since I live in the community but it just didn't do anything for me."}
{"text":"Great for a casual weekend lunch Tapas were great, but the paella didn't meet my expectations :(  The servers were attentive but when the restaurant got little busier, they were little less responsive.   Live music was very entertaining & the Sangria was just right!"}
{"text":"I am a giant fan of tapas and Spanish food in general. One of my favourite places to eat in Spain was the Canary Islands. Las Canarias stay very true to those flavours.  They have an awesome patio with different levels so everyone can watch the cation on 17th, and your not staring directly at your neighbor. Unfortunately it was raining when we went so inside we stayed. Liked that even when it got busier inside, it didn't get overly noisy which is a nice change.  We went as a group of 4 hungry humans. We ordered 8 dishes to start and then added some more because it was all just too good. Below is a review of each dish.  CHAMPIÑONES AL AJILLO - skillet filled with mushrooms done ina delightful garlic white wine sauce  GAMBAS CON GABARDINA DE COCO - 5pc coconut shrimp with a orange ginger dip. One person refered to this dish as delightful. It was on special on Tues night and was so good we have a second plate.  TORTILLA ESPAÑOLA CON ALI-OLI - lovely moist potato omelet. Ali oli sauce is tasty without being overpowering.  CHORIZO A LA SIDRA - little pieces of chorizo braised in apple cider. Chorizo was sweeter than we expected but good size portion that dissapeared quick.  PAPAS ARRUGADAS CON MOJO - salted baby potatoes with both mojo sauces. You can only get mojo sauce in the Canary Islands and was lovely to have again.  MEJILLONES Y ALMEJAS - 1lb of mussles in white wine chilli cream sauce. Good portion size but the real winner was the sauce. It was so good we kepyt the sauce and got a ton more bread to soak it all up.  CROQUETAS CASERAS - 3pc daily croquetas, was cod the day we went. Perfectly fried on the outside and soft and flavourful on the inside. Would love to try all the different ones they do.  All 6 MONTADITOS - this is tapas on bread. Like that we had this plate last as we were full enough by this stage to cut each one into portions so we could try them all. - mackrel with horseradish cream - generous portion of serrano ham with stewed tomato base (SO GOOD!) - potato omlette  - smoked oysters with fire roasted tomato sauce - chorizo pate with spicy mojo sauce - white anchovies with olive oil  All in our bill was just over $100. Not bad for all the food we packed away.  Overall the food was excellent, service was great and we were allowed to sit and relax and enjoy our meal together. I will absolutely be back to try the paellas and fideuas which I am sure will be incredibly tasty.  This is sure to become my favourite tapas spot in the city."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant two days ago. We ordered a fish soup, calamari and grilled shrimp and had beer with it. The food was excellent.  I have a passion for calamari and these ones were cooked to perfection. The shrimp had spanish/mediteranian condiments and ... garlic. The fish soup was excellent too. Personnel were friendly and the owner has modified the interior and gave it a mediteranian touch somehow in contrast with its location.  The restaurant has live flamenco events over weekends and provides a pleasant lighting and privacy.  I am positive we will repeat the experience."}
{"text":"Won't be here long, food and service leave a lot to be desired. Went once, thought it was a fluke. Tried again. Nope, same poor service and very over priced"}
{"text":"I went to Las Canarias with two friends, one being from Spain and the other having lived in Spain for a bit. Me, I've been to Spain a few times and absolutely love their food. We had a bit of high expectations as we had read Gilchrist's review in the Calgary Herald, although I'm now convinced that Gilchrist needs to get out more into the real world to widen his palette.   Let's start with the service. We arrived on a Friday, late afternoon, 3'ish therefore there was only one table with two people. The waitress was extremely slow. She took about 10minutes to bring us the menu... don't ask me why. We ordered the following: Tortilla Espan'ola, which only came with two slices! We all looked at each other with the WTF expression, never seen this dish served in slices, we are all used to getting the entire tortilla. The taste, meh. Salpicon de mariscos was OK, small. The one I had the most trouble with was the gambas al ajillo. Overcooked shrimp and very greasy. Too bad. Aceitunas, these were ok, not sure why they charge this plate when everywhere else these are free. But let's continue. Nueces tostadas con Datiles, overall ok. My two fiends had the sangria which looked delicious and I had an amazing glass of white wine.   To get our bill, the server disappeared and we waited until someone else took notice from the kitchen, a nice guy from Spain!! Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for traditional Spanish food. My husband and I enjoyed the paella and calamari. The calamari came in large tender ringlets.  The lemon aioli went really well with the squid.   The paella was lovely. It takes time to cook, so if you are in a rush, call ahead and give them the heads up you are coming so they can get a head start to it. Seafood was not overcooked, which is hard to do in a paella. Rice was flavourful and tasted of the sea. The mussels were spot on. Juicy and fresh.   Take advantage of their daily specials and happy hour. We came on a Sunday (paella and sangria is 20% off) and had two drinks, calamari and the paella for only $60 bucks! That is a steal for all that seafood and a spot on paella. This place is a gem on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for tapas and paella. The food was fantastic and our waitress Maria was the best, patient and informative. My favorite was the Squid and Longastine with black  (Squid ink) rice"}
{"text":"Only a few months old and not long for this world unless someone listens up and pulls it together.   Las Canarias NEEDS a Food Expeditor.  As tapas restaurant with a reasonably high price point this needs to be a no brainer.   Without this,  this place will fail.   We went in and were the last table seated on a Friday night.   In all honestly,  they should have turned us away as they couldn't support the tables they had.    I didn't notice the growing discord in the room until after we ordered and I am kicking myself not surveying the room.    To our right we had the table that was silently fuming that were trying to get other of the ASAP and to the left we had the almost abusive to servers table that eventually confronted the owner/manager by the kitchen.  From other tables,  I could hear dining mates apologize for such a poor choice or tease others about not being able to pick dinner next.  Walking in didn't even feel like eating yet so when I eventually clued into the growing discord I wasn't overly upset and figured I could weather the delays and I did for a while.  I was getting apologies from the service staff before I even started to worry about it.  Eventually my chilled out, go with the flow attitude soured through.       We ordered a basket of bread -  not only was it like $3-6 (I forget) compared to free most places it also took over an hour.  This is one of those service items many many restaurants have  service staff look after and it arrives in minutes.  Most of the food arrived close to the two hour mark.  I ordered one entree and asked it to come with the tapas as I wasn't sharing and it didn't arrive until the 2.5 hour mark.  I watched everyone else eat and finish completely and then waited another 20 minutes before I got to eat.  I'm so glad i didn't have an appetite when I walked in. I probably would have ordered more than my one tiny entree had it shown up in a reasonable time frame but there was no chance of that 3 hours in and I went home and made dinner after dinner.  The owner/manager was very apologetic and I genuinely felt bad for pretty much every staff member in the whole room and I hope they know what has to change there to get the ship righted.  All that being said the food was solid to good.  The tapas here are probably more traditional than my favorite tapas which are a bit more new world than here.    I would return but not for several months or until I have confirmation things have improved.    The restaurant is very close to home and a nice place to go out for some wine and Spanish food and not have to worry too much about insane cab fares so it would be nice to have it as an available option.  I welcome the owners reaching out and letting me know of any future logistical changes in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Tried really hard to enjoy this spot. Great location, outdoor seating was nice, service was so so.   I ordered the marinated olives....reminds me of olives from a can. Soft and outdated. No crunch to any of them and they were drowning in oil.   Rabbit in garlic sauce...looks are deceiving. They cooked the rabbit perfect like absolutely perfect but there was no flavor at all to the entire dish. Just a faint taste of what would be great if they actually seasoned the meal.   Menu is way overpriced for the quality of food I had. Wine list isn't bad but honestly limited.   Hope your experience is better than mine!"}
{"text":"Although we were a large party (about 20 people) and reserved on very short notice, the service was wonderful and the food delicious.  Everyone was happy -- the omnivores, vegans, gluten-free, and kids.  Many of the dishes were described by multiple relatives as \"best ever\", especially the olives and paella.  I highly recommend.  They've been in this location for about 5 months (as of July 2017), but in business for about 2 years."}
{"text":"From the appetizers to the dessert  all was tasty and delicious!! It is a romantic place! Service is very good and friendly  the paella was amazing ! I will come back again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic paella and sangria! Beautiful space, amazing service. Such a great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Food took some time to prepare but the wait was definitely worth it, since you're sure that it's freshly cooked. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Besides having amazing food (specially paellas) they have awesome deals most of the days.  I ordered a chicken and chorizo paella and it was fantastic! Plus their selection of wine is really good and excellent quantity! Our waitress was a lovely Spanish girl! I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Last minute stopped for a drink while my daughter had lunch. Service was outstanding and we were given complimentary drinks and a sample tapas which was amazing!!  Yes and my daughter said her veggie burger was the best."}
{"text":"The paella is amazing!!! The service very friendly and the restaurant is really beautiful!! The Appetizers were just ok... And the sangria was normal as well... Not bad, but not really good ... I would like to go back to try more dishes.. If everything else is like the paella should be awesome, but if the rest of the menu is like pulpo a la Gallega or croquetas ... I would only have paella every time I go there..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, live music and good food.  The new Fava Bean stew is so good.  Mixed salad with goat cheese...excellent.  Tempranillo wine. Then black coffee and a dessert taster platter.  Altogether a wonderful meal!"}
