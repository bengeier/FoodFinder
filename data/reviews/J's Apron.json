{"text":"Really nice spot for brunch! The food is great and the workers are really friendly. Would definitely suggest and come back!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Friday morning. They opened at 10 AM and the small restaurant was nicely designed. The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing thanks to the friendly staff and music.   I ordered the Hawaiian pulled pork eggs benedict and a hazelnut cake. Set on white bread, eggs benedict had onions arugula, and the pulled pork. Everything came together nicely. It had a side of kettle chips (my favorite part). The hazelnut cake was a great treat. The cream was great for the cake itself. I noticed there was some inconsistency in the \"moistness\" of the cake. But this might be just part of the character of the cake.   Overall, the food was just right and comforting. It wasn't mind blowing delicious but it wasn't terrible. You can sense the care placed into creating these dishes. The carefully created food mixed with the warm atmosphere made my Friday morning beautiful. It was a bit odd that they called themselves a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant. It wasn't really a noticeable identity for them. But with that set aside, I will be returning and trying more items from their menu, regardless if it truly is a Japanese-Italian fusion. This restaurant is incredibly charming and the food didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Friendly staff - loved the chicken eggs Benedict.  Price was on point."}
{"text":"Location/Service Very small restaurant along Harbord St. Street/side-street parking is available (best to carpool as the area is relatively busy). There is a sign indicating where the restaurant is - although the name is J's Apron, it is a little small and tricky to find (but a hidden gem). Nice modern decor inside, perfect brunch atmosphere. Service was also very nice, our waitress was also informative on the menu items.  Food This place is a bit of an Asian/Western fusion brunch. They offer your standard eggs benedict/sandwiches, but there's also interesting sushi/fish-related cuisine with an Asian twist to it.  Polpette di tonno (or tuna balls) - more of an appetizer snack. It's kinda of like sushi, but wrapped in a ball. Very nice complimentary sauce, making it not dry and perfect bit size. A bit hard to describe, but there's a lot of flavors in the bite that's mixed well together.  Insaltaa di Coffee Beef - another appetizer, it's like a steak salad. This dish was okay for me.  The beef was a little tough, but the salad itself was pretty good - along with the peppers and cheese gave it a good complimentary.  J'Osaka - it gives me of a salmon torched sushi feeling to it. There's 6 pieces, coming along with spinach and potato chips. The chips were very crispy and light to eat - good complimentary to the sushi. The fish was very fat (the good fat kinda feeling) and the rice was not cooked or stacked too hard - so when you chew it, it all melts in your mouth.  Hawaiian Pull Pork - egg benedict served on white bread and pulled pork. I'm a huge fan of benedicts and the egg for this dish was done to perfection - runny and soft. The pulled pork also complimented well to the dish. Again, it also had the crispy potato chips on the side.  Overall, this is a very nice hidden brunch place not everyone might be aware of. There are very limited seats available, but they do take reservations. All the items complimented well with each other and I'd like the idea of creativity of the menu items."}
{"text":"Cute little place for brunch or lunch! Open daily from 10am to 5pm with the exception of Mondays when they are closed. I came here around 1pm on a Sunday with my fiance and we managed to get a table right away - they quickly filled up afterwards though as the whole restaurant only seats about 20 people.  They serve different eggs benedict variations as well as sandwiches and salads. I ordered their premium salmon eggs benedict which comes with poached eggs and greens served with hollandaise sauce on two beds of salmon (cooked sous vide). Note that this particular eggs benny doesn't come with english muffins. What was special about this dish is that they also include two pieces of their Osaka sushi (aburi sushi) - choice of salmon or shrimp. I had a hard time choosing because I wanted to try both and they were kind enough to let me have one of each! Both the eggs benny and sushi were delicious. My fiance ordered the chicken sandwich which came with chicken (cooked sous vide as well), avocado, grilled onions, spinach, and bacon. He had a choice of salad or potato wedges and picked the wedges which were actually more like fresh kettle chips - so good! Random note - they put lemon and rosemary in their water which I thought was a nice touch.  Service was excellent and I loved the charming decor inside. Wooden tables, chairs, and a long bench run along their brick walls. Definitely recommend checking J's Apron out."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.0/5.0  A brunch spot featuring Japanese fusion plates, the decor is clean cut while offering a very welcoming experience.  We got the Hawaiian pulled pork benny which is their take on eggs benedict featuring Hawaiian pulled pork, pickled onions, poached egg, hollandaise sauce served with freshly made truffle oiled kettle chips topped with shredded cheese.  The premium option also comes with pressed sushi which was surprisingly decent. The kettle chips were also a nice touch, offering something different from your typical sides.   The pulled pork was slightly over marinated but other than that it was a decent brunch spot to check out. Their service was also polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Paying heed to other Yelpers advice I decided to visit this place on a Friday for brunch. The setup is functional with a nice clean look. I decided to order the salmon premium. The salmon is sous vide topped with poached eggs and you get a side of two pieces of aburri sushi (shrimp or salmon) I chose the shrimp.  The tastes are clean and the fish quality seemed decent. If you are looking for a light brunch this would do just fine. Some of the dessert options caught my eye (especially one offered in the evening) I will probably be back to try out one of those."}
{"text":"Visited J's Apron for brunch during the week and loved the cozy vibe of the place. There wasn't a lot of seating so I can imagine that the place would get pretty busy on the weekends. We ordered the Eggs Benny with Hawaiian pulled pork (which also came with a side of potato wedges) and a latte. Loved the balance of the savoury, sour and sweet flavours of the Benny, but the latte wasn't anything particularly special. Probably one of my new favourite brunch places!"}
{"text":"First of all, YUM! This small, quaint restaurant located on Harbord Street is, to see the least, divine. The service is phenomenal and the food, the icing on the cake.   While the menu is small, it is still very hard to choose what to eat. There were so Many options and I could have definitely eaten all of them. The Hawaiian Benedict was delicious but the J's Osaka for me was the best. The pressed sushi was fresh and delicious. I also enjoyed the crunchy potato chips and salad. Altogether, it was a well put together dish - both aesthetically and flavor wise.    I would definitely recommend making reservations as the restaurant is small and be prepared to wait a little for your meal to come out. Perfection takes time and it's well worth the wait. :)   They also just launched a dinner menu so I'll be sure to go back to try it soon!"}
{"text":"Found this cute little gem near the Annex. What caught my interest was that their breakfast was a combination of Japanese and Italian cuisine.   Restaurant: The interior is quite small, but the window allows lots of sunlight in to make it look very welcoming. Unfortunately, if you are beside that window, you'll take the brunt of the sunlight rays. It's also a little cramped. I know the table was for four people but I felt like there should be more space although the interior doesn't allow it.  Price: I would consider this place a bougie breakfast/brunch kinda place. It's about ~$15-20 per person, it's deff worth trying once. The portions are a bit small for the price though.  Food: Okay, so I got J's Osaka. Looks like Maki sushi but salmon is cooked sous-vide and it's just a lot fancier (they topped it with parmesan). First bite I took was really really delicious! It was creamy and not too much that I couldn't taste my salmon. The only thing was that I started tasting way more parmesan than my meal, so I recommend scraping off some of it to fully enjoy it. I would have liked to have a slice of lemon squeezed on top to balance out the flavour. It comes with a side salad and \"potato wedges\". They were really potato chips, why would they lie to me like that.   Overall, I was really satisfied coming out. I do wish the portions were bigger but hey, it was quality food. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Adorable space with delicious coffee! Had their smoked salmon & veggie eggs bennies which were just alright in my opinion. But their \"chips\"--those thinly sliced potato wedges fried to a crisp w Parmesan shavings--they were fantastic! I also loved the little touches to the meal: the gold cutlery and the rosemary/lemon infused water were nice flourishes. And all their coffee have double espresso shots by default!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my friend around 12:30-1 on a weekday and we were seated right away. They do have limited tables but they're spaced out nicely without overcrowding. The space is super cute and nice with lighting hanging down from the ceiling and glossed wooden tables. I got their iced americano and Hawaiian pulled pork eggs benedict. Their americano was excellent so I can tell that the beans they use for their espresso is solid. The eggs were poached perfectly and not too wet. The pulled pork was however not as semi-melt-in-your-mouth as I expected as I thought it would be cooked more. The presentation and combination of the egg, pulled pork, and white bun was great! However, the chips they put on the side is pretty inconsistent. I got some burnt potato chips, some soggy, and some perfect. The meal would have been better had the potato chips were all edible-ly-delicious. I appreciated the sprinkle of cheese on the chips too, added more ba-bum!  J's Apron definitely stands out against its neighbouring brunch competitors and I would recommend J's Apron over them as well!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this cute brunch spot. Unfortunately was ruined when waitress came with two iced coffees and spilt an entire one on our table & on our belongings. New restaurant & most likely new hired server? She felt horrible and said sorry many times & i didn't want to make a big fuss so we finished our meal and left. Zero discount & not even a waiver of the coffee..."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Sunday. Short one minute walk from Harbord and Spadina.  The place is small (probably seats 20 ppl max) and most tables are for two ppl.  Great food. Got J's premium salmon ($16) and my friend got hawaiian pulled pork ($14).  Attentive service and everything was aesthetically pleasing (cutlery, decor, even the washrooms. Super clean!).  Portion-wise, you don't get a lot of food (more of a snack-size for me) but it all was very tasty. Will come here again."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  Shhhhh I'm tempted to not review J's Apron simply bc I had the delightful, rare experience of arriving there for brunch on a Sat and not having to wait for a table! But this place is too good not to share.  THE FOOD- My friends and I all had bennies. I had the Hawaiian Pulled Pork Bennie and it was delicious. The pork was well proportioned with the sauce, and overall the dish was far less heavy than I expected. They marinate the pork in pineapple juice and that gave it a lovely undertone. Their homemade potato chips were the perfect compliment! My one critique is that the pork was a little drier than I would have liked.  THE DRINK- I ordered an Americano, which was very good but was envious of my friend's latte which had a beautiful floral design drawn in the foam.  THE SPACE- Very cute, cosy spot in an old Annex house. Adorable details like shiny copper cutlery.  THE SERVICE- Great, attentive & friendly ser vice!"}
{"text":"Came here because of Blog TO's feature of the restaurant. I'm always looking for new, reliable and affordable places for brunch, so that I don't always find myself gravitating towards the stables Mildred Temple Kitchen and School. But, guys, I've found a new personal fave that I will be sure to revisit!!   First of all, marrying brunch with Japanese and Italian fusion is pure genius. I am of Asian roots and I love love love Asian food, and it so happens that I also love love love brunch. Combining the two together, how could I stay away????   [THE FOOD] I got the J's Osaka with salmon which was essentially salmon aburi with a side of truffle chips and salad. It was amazing; every bite of sushi, chip and salad was packed with flavour and very complementary with each other. I would highly recommend the J's Osaka for anyone going there for brunch looking for something more fresh, light but satisfying as opposed to the usual heavier eggs bennie  [THE AMBIENCE] Very casual and cute. It's not super crowded with lines going out the door which I really appreciated!! It's not loud and overbearing where people are trying to talk over each other just to hear each other either! It's nice, small and intimate."}
{"text":"This is my newest favourite brunch spot! I ordered the Hawaiian pulled pork benny and the salmon oishi (forgot what it's actually called on their menu). They came with salad and house made potato chips on the side. The benny was very well made, really enjoyed the sweet savoury taste of the pulled pork. The salmon oishi (blowtorched salmon sushi) was pretty good, although I have to say I still prefer Miku and Jabistro's versions topped with jalapeño. To be fair, I see J's Apron as a brunch place with a Japanese twist and not a full on Japanese restaurant like the two mentioned above though. As for beverages, I really liked the idea of the house made orange soda but it's a bit sweet so the second time I asked for less ice and less syrup. The server was really pleasant as well. Only took away 1 star because there aren't that many menu options and the food sometimes takes awhile. Overall highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm addicted to the pork and beef sandwiches. Have not tried much else but I can assume its quality all around, the chef uses obviously fresh and top quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is so pretty, I felt like I was in Italy. The customer service was so nice and the food was decent too. Comparing to all the other brunch places I've reviewed this is by far the best one. Oh also their utensils are so pretty, I wish I could've just took them home lol. Shoutout to the lady who serviced us, you were great. There are a lot of brunch places on this street, but this one is the best, trust me. Thankful I don't have burnt toasts like the last brunch place I went to."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. You know the deal, had to wait around for approximately 45 minutes to get in. Decent portions. The menu is limited but unique with the blend of Italian and Japanese cuisine they have. Service was so so. Note that it is a very small spot so if you intend to go in with a large party, you are not likely to get in w/o reservations. Unfortunately, no mimosas or bloody Marys/Caesars for brunch which was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"We visited this hidden gem on a late Saturday morning and was lucky to get seated right away as this place was cozy with limited seating.   The interior of the café was well lit, with modern décor along with pillows on the seats to give that warm and cozy feel.   We started off with their Americano (ordered one shot but usually comes with two) and a Café Mocha.  Their Americano was well brewed, bringing the bold flavors without too much acidity and was served in a regular sized mug.  We also really enjoyed the Café Mocha not only for its artistic presentation but for the well-balanced flavours between the rich cocoa and smooth espresso. We almost finished all of our drinks before the main course arrived because it was THAT good!  Their menu included a variety of styles for the eggs benedict as well as a sandwich menu for lunch- perfect for a brunch place! For the mains, we decided on the J's Salmon Premium and the Hawaiian Pulled Pork eggs benedict.  We were surprised by everything from the plating to the unique tastes of each dish.   J's Salmon Premium - This was not your traditional eggs benny, as the salmon was served in a sous-vide style and was also the base of the benedict, which totally added to the uniqueness of the dish. The poached eggs were made perfectly with the yolk still runny yet contained. The hollandaise sauce and the I wasabi cream went surprisingly well together with the eggs, salmon, and leafy greens. The wasabi cream tasted more like blue cheese and the wasabi itself is quite faint - it would be nice if there was a stronger taste of horseradish to pull the flavours together. Nonetheless, the rest of the flavours were on point. This dish was also served with a side of two aburi sushi (J's Osaka) pieces either with salmon or shrimp. We went with the shrimp aburi and was surprised by the flavours of the garlic and citrus-like sauce. The vinegar and temperature of the rice was just right, along with a few ginger pieces to clean our palettes which added a nice Japanese touch to the dish!  Hawaiian Pulled Pork - The pork was well braised as it was not too dry or overdone. The pork was also marinated in a well-balanced, not too sweet yet savoury flavor. The pickled onion added a nice acidity and complemented the pork quite well. Again the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce and leafy greens harmonized the benedicts. Unlike the Salmon benedict, this was served on a sourdough base which added more volume to the dish.  This was also served with a side of potato wedges and was not what we expected! The wedges were flawlessly flavoured with garlic and onion, also thinly cut with a good ratio of potato and crispiness. Serving this style of potato wedge added a variation of texture and completed the dish.  The service was quick and the staff were quite friendly. The rosemary and lemon in the water, along with the rosegold brass utensils demonstrates the level of detail and creativity the restaurant puts in; which is definitely commendable. If you want a unique, fusion brunch experience, this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to visit this place since I heard many good things from my foodie friends.  Finally had a chance to visit this place last weekend and it did not disappoint!  This restaurant is very small, so if you do not make reservation and is coming around noon, expect waiting a little.  For two people, we ordered the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict, J's Osaka (aburi sushi, Iced Orange Ade and a Latte.  Both the Smoked Salmon Egg Benny and J's Osaka comes with side chips  and those chips were addictive!! My friend and I couldn't stop eating them! The Smoked Salmon Egg Benny meal comes with two egg bennies and the poached egg was delicious! The J's Osaka is their aburi sushi, they were great too, but portion is a little small and I wasn't really feeling those cheese flakes on the top.  Latte and Orange Ade tasted normal.  Overall, I really enjoyed my time at J's Apron and will return again to try the other Egg Benny."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place, I had to try it for myself. It definitely did not disappoint!   The restaurant is quite small, however they do take reservations which is helpful. We were lucky to have walked in and got a seat without reservations (probably due to the horrendous weather).   The service was friendly and pretty quick. Overall the flavours were very good and great atmosphere.   We ordered 4 items:   J's oh meat - which was a eggs Benedict with a meat patty on some lettuce and a squash puree. The egg and sauce was perfect, however the sweetness of the purée was so over powering you couldn't taste much of anything else. It was way too sweet and couldn't taste the flavour of the meat patty.   J's Osaka Salmon and Shrimp - both were very tasty! It came with 6 pieces along with a side of salad and chips. The sauce on both the salmon and shrimp were the same and paired nicely with both. Only complaint is that it's fairly expensive for the amount you get.   Hawaiian pulled pork sandwich - good flavour and well balanced. Tasted pretty close to pork laulau from Hawaii. Good juicy sandwich.   Majority of the items were very good but just a little on the pricy side. I would definitely like to try their dinner menu though. They had some interesting items. Overall I would come again to try other items."}
{"text":"If you like Japanese and Italian.. this is the place to go! Also the customer service is above and beyond! The dessert was the highlight of what all I have had"}
{"text":"I thought that since this was a hole-in-the-wall it wouldn't be that busy, but man was I wrong... on a Saturday afternoon (prime brunch time), the entire place was packed but we got seated in a few minutes, so that was fine. They only had one waitress, who was quite attentive, and the whole vibe of the restaurant was very chill, relaxing and suitable for all ages. A cute thing that they had was the water infused with rosemary-lemon, which I thought was unique.   We ordered two eggs benedicts, the hawaiian pulled pork and the salmon premium. They were both very delicious, and I love the little sushi rolls that came with the salmon one! I would order a plate of only that next time because the Aburi sushi was just soo delicious. I also really loved the wedge fries that accompanied the pulled pork eggs benny.   I would definitely come back to try their other stuff! I suppose I will have to try again at an earlier time instead of noon."}
{"text":"Interior decor is great. Loving the deconstructed brick walls and wall tiles. We loved out copper computed cutlery too. J's premium salmon egg benedict doesn't come with English muffin bun. It is egg on smoked salmon with greens. If you are ok with this egg Benedict idea then go right ahead!   Pulled pork egg Benedict and smoked salmon egg Benedict are on regular bread instead of English muffin.  We loved the truffle fries aka potato wedges aka kettle chips.   I asked our waitress for no cheese but she forgot but was kind enough to remake the truffle fries without the cheese. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Honestly wow at the Salmon Osaka. A true union of Japanese and Italian flavors. Skip the eggs benny (nothing wrong with it but also nothing quite special) and just get Osaka the meal. It's truly a unique and delicious experience.   Service was also impeccable, everyone is so friendly! Definitely coming back to try dinner!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't have thought that there would be a Japanese Italian fusion brunch option in Toronto- and it wasn't bad! Food was decent and would recommend their aburi since it's their speciality. It's not mind blowing or unique aburi but it's still tasty. On the other hand, they make really good potato crisps here"}
{"text":"Eggs Benny with Hawaiian pulled pork ($13) The eggs were poached perfectly, the pulled pork meat wasn't dry which was good. Tasted good but nothing special. I found it hard to cut the bread for some reason. Comes with a bowl of potato wedges, which actually tasted like kettle chips. They were super crispy, topped with some cheese flakes and japanese seasoning. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think the photo wedges was the best part of the dish.  J's Osaka ($16) Comes with 6 pieces of pressed sushi with the option to choose from salmon and shrimp. Went with the salmon. The fish and rice ratio wasn't the greatest. It was a really thin piece on top, and normally there should be a piece of fish in the center of the rice, which in this case did not. It was just a rectangle of rice. Comes with a side of salad and photo wedges, which tasted like kettle chips. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but it was quite expensive for what you get.  Overall it's a nice cafe, great atmosphere. The food was good but I found it a bit too expensive and nothing special.  I didn't have the greatest first impression here. When I first walked in, the waitress asked me to sit inside in between 4 tables, which was fine because I didn't want to sit near the door given it was a super cold day. Another couple comes in and the waitress sits them a table beside me. Then 2 mins later the waitress comes to my table and asks me to sit further down near the table which was right in front of the door claiming that a table of 5 are coming in later and she needs to combine tables. If someone made reservations already in advance, why would you tell me to sit there and then move after. Also, the couple that came after me got to sit further from the door than me. I know it's something small, but it just bothered me."}
{"text":"A wonderful random find in Toronto.  On our way out of town a quick yelp search guided us to this meticulous little brunch joint.  The perfect breakfast to end a weekend in Toronto.  Delicious Benedict's, great espresso and fresh made truffle parm chips."}
{"text":"J's Apron is a cozy brunch spot on Harbord! They do eggs benedict well, which comes with their unforgettable kettle chips. The coffee (americano) is great and the service each of the three times I've visited has been fantastic. Still a new joint, so it hasn't been particularly busy compared to other brunch spots, but I'm sure that will change eventually... so come now before that happens!!"}
{"text":"Delicious new brunch spot which serves up a delicious eggs benedict and also offers Japanese options."}
{"text":"A fantastic tiny spot in the Annex that should be far more busy than it is.  They have the best Aburi sushi in the city... and you can have it for brunch.  Maybe this doesn`t sound as amazing as it is; but trust me, its pretty fantastic.  It`s so good that I skip the J Osaka with the wasabi benedict and go straight for the aburi.  The coffee is excellent as well.  I would try other things on the menu but love the aburi that much.  As for the space, it is super small.  As I mentioned at the top, you can still get a spot fairly easily which will likely change. It is an informal space but comfortable."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere at a great location. The food is as delicious as it seems in photos - personally love the chips that comes with the Benedict. Tried the smoked salmon and The pulled pork Benedict - which was both quite good.  Would definitely recommend for a brunch date/ meet up!"}
