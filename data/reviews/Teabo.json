{"text":"Very excited for this place! I have only been once and I instantly love it! It has all the delicious Asian food snacks that I have been craving for years! Best service I have had in a long time too! A little nervous about this being right by my house... won't be good for my diet!  I had the BBQ sandwich, boba smoothie, and the Ice Bowl; all were great!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I've come here so often that I've filled up 5 of my Perka punch cards. My cousin and I race each other to see who can get more punches. The drinks are well made and tasty but my favorite part about this place is the costumer service. Everybody is really friendly. My only complaint is that there are no booths. The place is big and has lots of seating but I'd like to come here after school to eat/drink and do some homework. I find it hard to get comfortable and focus on my work in the cold metal chairs. Other than that, this place is fantastic. (Try the mango heart jellies and the signature boba in your drink. It's great)"}
{"text":"had good expectations, better appearance than most boba shops i've been to. i got the signature artichoke tea with seeds, jelly and boba (all preset in the drink). disappointed to find the boba isn't actual boba instead it is gelatin  balls they claim as boba.  second disappointment was the quality of the chicken. had two different chicken bowls at my table and the chicken was low grade and rubbery"}
{"text":"Love this place! The servers were nice and super friendly, the place was clean and organized. They made our drinks quick and delicious. My favorite us the signature tea ( artichoke tea with white boba). Their white boba is unique compares to other places. This will be a new favorite place for bobaholic person like me"}
{"text":"I have been here five times including twice today not just for tea but for their food! I give the beef curry and the lemongrass chicken a 10! I can't wait to try the sandwiches next.. my new favorite quick food on the west side!"}
{"text":"Great food selection,  great Boba selection, friendly service and very clean establishment. Would choose to eat here anytime."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork bun and got this? I can literally buy these at the market. I also got their signature drink and strawberry/kiwi teas. Very refreshing and they're both a sizable amount for 4.25 each. However. there isn't anything particularly unique about this place. Their name does draw attention because it's reminiscent of  Tebo Tebo Tea Lounge which is a well known chain in California but they're not associated."}
{"text":"I really like their drinks! They make their matcha green tea taste aromatic. Can't really explain it u just have to try it. Their signature tea is really good too and pork buns are a good price for 3  I definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Drinks & food are very good! I am glad I don't need to go to California to get all the good food.. try this place.."}
{"text":"I am super happy I found this lil hidden gem close to Goodyear. I love their boba teas, they add fresh fruit. And they serve chicken and waffles. Yes. You read that right... check out their menu, you'd be surprise what they offer :)"}
{"text":"Yay! Finally, I found a boba place that serves super yummy, almost perfect boba drinks to my liking! And it's close to where I live. Whenever I have hankerings for their boba drinks, I just make my wonderful hubs go pick one up after his shift lol.   So far, I've tried their rice bowl and Pho and they're really good. Not a fan of their Pork buns though... But looking forward to trying other dishes on their menu. I recommend going there for lunch; your meal comes with a free 16oz drink. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had ordered the signature boba drink & it was very good. The drink was infused with artichoke tea & had white boba on the bottom. I love artichoke tea, but my friend wasn't used to the flavor & didn't like the drink. Service was good."}
{"text":"This is the best for everything. I love you guys. Come here and enjoy your fav drink. Reanna, Zoeline and Brenda is the best workers and they are so sweet"}
{"text":"Great staff, and drinks, very friendly and upbeat. Staff is polite and respectful and not in your face like at Dutch bros. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Met my beloved girlfriend there for lunch on Monday, 5 Feb 2018. It was our first time. Teabo has a banner outside their store advertising FREE 16oz with at least $5.97 purchase. We order 2 bowls of the combination pho. So, we asked for our free drinks to be 2 unsweetened green teas with no ice. When our food and drinks were brought to our table, the server girl says as she placed our ICED green teas on the table -- \"Ummm, they couldn't do the teas with no ice. They said that if no ice, it would be $1.00 extra for each cup.\" WTH! The \"they\" in the kitchen were the EXTRA TIGHT owners of this restaurant. This is the first and only place we have been where were told that no-ice into our teas would be extra money! No more Teabo! The very next time we head out for pho, and bobas, and teas, we are going to Da Vàng, 4538 N 19th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85021, (602) 242-3575. They are the original Vietnamese restaurant in the valley, over 30 years. And they do not nickel & dime you to death. Their pho is superb, and everything on their menu is absolutely delicious. BTW, their banh mi (sandwiches) are the bomb!!!! And no, I am not related to them, nor am I being paid by them to mention them in this rating of Teabo. I voluntarily recommend Da Vàng because I am completely disgusted and put-off by Teabo. Don't waste your money at Teabo. Get more quality food for your money at Da Vàng!!!!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite boba place. better than jt boba house. get the chocolate coconut with the tapioca. isabell is a nice caring cashier and she is very helpful with the flavor options"}
{"text":"Very clean and inviting on the inside, staff was very friendly and I love the fact that the drinks come with an unusual seal, makes them easier to carry inside home/work if you buy more than two.  No spills.."}
{"text":"This place has nice, friendly employees, as well as tasty food and boba. It's a good find in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Teobo. They have a lot of sandwich, noodle, and rice bowl options. Plus, the boba teas are very good and have a decent selection of flavor options. The service is and the staff is friendly.  The establishment itself is hip and equipped with charging stations for your electronic devices. I have been to this place a few times and was happy to see the addition of pho on the menu. I really enjoyed the shrimp pho. Also, try their delicious custard buns."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They are always so happy to see you. I don't think I've ever had to wait longer than 5 mins for my drinks, I usually order 4+ drinks. They have quite a large varieties of drinks and snacks. Even offer to carry my order out to the car since I am carrying the baby. So sweet. Thanks Teabo, you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"Love the place! It's clean and tidy. Food and drink is amazing! Recommended my colleagues and they agreed with my review."}
{"text":"They just added pho to the menu and it's pretty bomb. & I normally don't ever eat pho!   I've also had their ribeye banh mi and grilled pork sausage rolls and they are super yummy!   Drinks are fire too. My mom is pretty particular about smoothies and she's come back twice in 1 day for their slushes before. I'm not very adventurous when it comes to drinks so I stick to Thai tea and milk teas."}
{"text":"Their teas, Boba smoothies, and service is amazing! Looking for something light? The triple flavored tea is delicious. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance & so glad I did!  Ordered the lemon grass chicken bowl & a Strawberry Milk tea with Mango boba.  Sooo good- IF you like lemongrass.  If you don't or don't know what lemon grass flavor is, sample beforehand. The employees were top notch!  Very kind, helpful, and gleeful.  Very clean establishment too! The experience  was amazing!  An additional plus- they have games to occupy time while you wait!"}
{"text":"Just found Teabo and so glad that I did got the matcha green tea Boba with almond flavoring the best I've ever had :-) next time I plan on getting something to eat along with the Boba Tea everything looked fantastic"}
{"text":"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME Food, smoothies and staff . . . The Green Machine Smoothie is not to be missed. Stop by, tell your friends and explore their culinary delights . . .  Having their best seller Ribeye sandwich today! YUM!"}
{"text":"I had the \"Kissed\" flavored tea with regular boba and it was truly the BEST tea I've ever had. It was refreshing and not too sweet. It was very reasonably priced too compared to other boba shops! The ladies working the front were so accommodating and walked me through the menu until I found what I wanted. Although, I live farther away, I will definitely be returning! Highly recommend this little jem!"}
{"text":"Best boba ever nice clean spot, also have good food! Chargers for devices tv and music. All good vibes"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and love this place. The Bbq pork buns are delicious and love the boba tea. Great service too!"}
{"text":"The shaved ice was nothing like the picture. Way too sweet and fruit was cut soon small. Overpriced for what you get. Boba drinks were mediocre."}
{"text":"They really make great drinks! The ladies are very friendly and the floor looks awesome!also, the painted tiles on the ceiling make it pop! You can tell they put work into this fantastic fantastic place! Also, about time there's an eatery that serves Boba drinks on the West-Side! Check it out for yourself! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Got the taro milk tea with boba. The boba was good but the taro milk tea was overly sweet and I couldn't taste the tea. Was pretty disappointed after seeing all the positive feedback."}
{"text":"This place is very unique and the first boba shop around the Goodyear west valley area. I got their signature drink and its alright. I'm not huge fan of it because it was a little too sweet for me. I also tried their original boba that they added in my drink and personally I don't like that. I prefer the chewy boba more. But I did try my friends drinks and they seem to be very decent. They have a very large menu for drinks and food so that a big plus. Service was very nice and all the staff seemed very enthusiastic. I would definitely be back again to try other drinks."}
{"text":"Signature boba is awesome...milk teas are great. Place has a great vibe. A good place to work and just hang out. They even offer games for families to play."}
{"text":"First visit and definitely did not disappoint. Ordered a pikachu drink with boba and lemon grass chicken bowl for my boyfriend and I to share. We had just had a meal not long ago but still felt a little hungry. To my surprise the lemon grass chicken bowl is served in a bigger portion than I had expected. It tastes really good! I highly recommend it. The drink was true to the flavor of its description and the boba was actually squishy and perfectly made. Definitely satisfied for the first visit and can't wait to come back again to try more on the menu! I'm sure I'll find many more items as delicious as the ones we ordered today. We'll be coming back or course. Next time I'm getting my own and not sharing!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've liked a lot of drinks I've got from heee and their pho is good. They are so nice too."}
{"text":"I've been here couple times. I like it at first but turns out they're very inconsistent. Same drink tastes different every time. Popcorn chicken is not great either. The meat is very dry, tough, and tasteless.   The place is clean and organized. I like the front desk people. They're very nice and friendly.   The older lady in the kitchen doesn't seem friendly at all. Or maybe the hot weather made her like that. Idk. I ordered 3 to go drinks and then asked for a cup of water. She looked at me from her kitchen like \"WTH\". Lol   Hopefully they'll be better in a soon future."}
{"text":"It would have been 5 stats however they took loooooooong to get out an order of steam dumplings and sausage rolls being only two customers.  The drinks - we tried The Signature tea and Taro Milk tea. The Signature tea was pretty good like delicious good. The Taro was a little too sweet and artificial tasting not my favorite.   The food - steamed bbq pork buns and grilled sausage rolls. 3 steamed buns for $2.45 was a real good deal. These little buns are so addicting. Are they made in house? No but still great(i love Dim Sum so i might be bias). The sausage rolls didn't taste good at first but the taste grew on me while eating the second roll specially with their dipping sauce which is quite tasty.  Customer Service - the 3 girls in the front were really nice. However the cooks(which im assuming are the owner, assuming by the looks) that would come out of the kitchen would not acknowledge you.   Overall good experience and would definitely be back when on that side of town."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and tasty drinks. It's very nice and clean inside with a chill vibe. Workers are very friendly, the pho is great."}
{"text":"Dropped by for yummy taro bobba tea for the first time. Sooo good. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable. We got a couple different flavors of macaroons  and the smoothie taro. They have a full sandwich menu and I can't wait to try them all. So excited we founded and so close to home. We will for sure be here all the time."}
{"text":"You guys! This California transplant is SO TOTALLY STOKED: Teabo is the boba shop I've been waiting to come to the West Valley for, like, forever!  Hubby convinced me we needed to try someplace new for dinner. He said they had sandwiches, which, I confess, did not sound even a little exciting to me. After looking at their menu, however, I had the suspicion this was no ordinary sandwich shop... their stuff sounded a lot like Bahn Mi! (Oh how I love Vietnamese food!!) We gave it a shot.  We placed our  order online, which was super convenient. Hubby got The Ribeye, while I ordered Summer Rolls and steamed BBQ pork buns. Oh my yumminess!! The Summer Rolls were PERFECT and even our picky 4-year-old kept begging for more of the pork buns, which were delightfully spongey and springy.   Hubby got a Thai tea to go with his meal, and I got a milk tea, because Boba!! I tell you what, here is where Teabo runs away from the other West Valley boba shops - theirs tastes JUST like my fave boba spot in Cali! Heavenly!  I had to ding them a star for their bread on the Ribeye - the sandwich was tasty, but lacked the wonderfully flakey, crusty and delicate french bread Vietnamese sandwiches are known for. Hubby was not happy about the boba texture on his tea, but I was the happiest I've been in a long time because each sip tasted like home to me.  Like boba and Vietnamese food? Come out and try this hidden West Valley gem. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I got the taro milk tea and it wasn't super sweet, which I like a lot so I'm not getting hit with a heavy sugar rush. Plenty of phone charging stations located on their tables. Good atmosphere for people hanging out including kids."}
{"text":"Great milk tea, but there is no way to mess that up. The service workers were nice, great shop. Why it can't be better than mediocre: food and owner. I had the pork sandwich. Pork itself was great, rest was bland as hell. All it needs is a bit of vinegar marinade on the veggies and stop using scrambled egg as filler. I was by myself in the giant dining area with the owner. He didn't ask if I enjoyed it, thanked me for coming in or invited me back. Any of those options are appropriate if you care about long term returning customers or just if you care about awkward silence."}
{"text":"Ehhh.. drinks really sugary.  Rice was good chicken was ok smelled aweful.. Looked past the hair on food :/  will give you discount for good review on yelp. Cashiers were nice."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time. Having lived in Southern California for years this reminds me of many of the boba drink and sandwich shops around the Orange County area.  I had the steamed pork buns which were delicious and the meat balls sandwich we had a delicious sauce that went with it. Ariana helped me and she was fabulous! Overall delicious will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! I did not know that Goodyear had a boba place so close to me, it was honestly so good! Me and my sister both got macaroons and green matcha tea it was really delicious, and the service was really great! They were very sweet! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Great tasting Boba! Cool and hip atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed  The staff at Teabo are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their food as bland. I really wanted to like Teabo  so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.  This was my first visit to Teabo, and for me the food  fell short. On this visit  I choose the chicken & waffles ( I actually ordered popcorn chicken and waffle fries but was giving the wrong entrée), Onion Rings, BBQ Pork Buns, and macaroons. All of our selections had very little taste. The bbq pork buns had just a very small amount of pork and the bread was extremely dry and tasteless.  The onion rings were greasy and stuck together, the waffles were soggy, and I did not like the taste of a chicken.  However, on a positive note the macaroons were absolutely delicious. All in all the food was just very disappointing.   Maybe I caught Teabo on a bad day.  However, I'm not in a rush to visit again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go. They're really fast with drinks and everyone is super nice !! :)   P.S. thank you to our two servers for cleaning up my recent mess... dropped my new drink before I was able to try it."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  I don't know what wrongs with people.  Everything was gross and the textures were off.  I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.  Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"I love the signature tea, and the original milk tea here. Very very tasty!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Teabo. I really did. The truth of it though, is that it just wasn't as awesome as I was hoping it would be, at all.  I love myself Vietnamese style sandwiches and I'm also a big fan of boba teas, and seeings how this place has both, I was excited to finally stop in and try both. The girls at the front counter were exceptionally nice - no complaints there. I ordered our favorite flavor, taro, for the kids and myself and a caramel pork sub. One of the girls brought over coloring supplies for the kids, which was very much appreciated.   The boba tea came out first. Very grainy, but drinkable. Then came the sandwich. Quite possibly the worst sandwich I've ever had. It was literally just slabs of fat inside it, no meat to be found. I had to return it and ask for something else. The girls at the counter didn't seem to have a problem with exchanging it, though the cooks in the back seemed to argue/lecture them about it as I returned to my table. I ordered a chicken breast sandwich in it's place. Much better. Still, I left feeling pretty disappointed.   I should mention that the inside of the place is very nice and clean, and again, the two girls working the front were great."}
{"text":"What a sweet little find on our way out to California. I absolutely adore Vietnamese food and we found this place on Yelp!   The dining area is set up like a fast food establishment, but it is so quaint. The seating is picnic tables. One goes up to the counter to place their order and receives a number. Then when your order is ready, they bring it out into go cups and plates. There's a condiment station with napkins and utensils, where you can help yourself. I liked that it is so incredibly clean inside. Not to mention colorful and bright.   When our food came, even though it was in Styrofoam bowls... I was surprised how fresh, scrumptious and authentic everything tasted. I had green tea and my partner had Thai tea. Both were good. They also have Bubba, which we didn't partake of. But they do have 2 large Framed posters on the wall explaining what it is if you're unfamiliar. (See pic!)  If you're in a hurry and you still wanna family feel, this place might just do you. A hot bowl of steaming Pho, some fresh spring rolls, and chili sauce, some of my favorite things to partake of!"}
{"text":"First time today & I must say so far so good! It is very clean and the staff is so friendly! I ordered The Sunrise smoothie with Boba and it satisfied my sweet tooth. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai iced tea w/Boba. I personally order the Thai milk tea with their traditional boba and it was very refreshing.  The tables in their medium sized spacious restaurant have charging ports ."}
{"text":"Cool little coffee, tea, and eats shop. Clean, new, and modern. Electric plug ins to charge your phone/ laptop while you enjoy your food and drinks. The girls behind the counter were friendly and helpful. Skip the big chains and try something a little more personal and friendly. Had a frappichino. Delicious and topped with a plastic wrap. You poke your straw through so you don't spill in your car like a standard cup does. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great drinks, great atmosphere and great service!! Come see Tami, she will give awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"I had a combo pho and a green tea bubble tea here a couple weeks back (wish I had pictures but I forgot to take them!) While their pho was okay, the bubble tea was what really sold me. I liked that wasn't too sweet or artificially flavored.  A good meal for a reasonable price.  Atmosphere was pretty nice too. They play a lot of pop music and it was a chilled place.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try other things on the menu- maybe they'll be better than pho."}
{"text":"They have just a lot on their menu and all of what I have tried it was GOOD!  I placed an order for pick up:  Thai Tea - Great flavor! Popcorn chicken - Fried crispy and still moist inside Honey coconut chicken - I did not taste much cocount, but it was still good Pork egg rolls - Fried but a little soggy when it got home, but still good  The service was fantastic and they did have my food and drink ready in 15 mins like they said."}
{"text":"Overall a very good experience! It was my first time there and the employees were very helpful when I asked for suggestions. Even though I waited a while for my order it was totally worth it! The signature tea was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ariana was a great cashier! She helped me pick out vegetarian options and we are excited to get our drinks. The custard bun as well."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I have driven past a couple of times and was curious. When I walked in it was like walking into a cute California Boba Tea Shop. They have multiple Bobas to choose from. They even have one they make in house. We loved it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great Boba drinks. little minor issue with the food but they were quick to resolve everything.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Teabo is probably my favorite tea house in Arizona. Not only are the drinks consistent, the establishment is clean, the customer service is wonderful and the bosses give us complimentary drinks. Not often, only twice since they opened but it's enough to got me to notice and appreciates this place. My family and I would drive out of our ways, it takes us about 25 minutes, to go grab Teabo.  What keep us coming back? The customer service and the drinks.  Rarely do you get good customer service at tea houses but I would have to commend this business for their fine customer service and their cute employees. Our favorite drinks are their consistent Mangonadas (they don't skim on the mangoes), their Signature tea, Peachy, Triple Stars, Avocado smoothie."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pho combo (beef) this afternoon.  I was hesitant because I never tried this place but seen the guy with the sign saying now open.  First, noticed the Pho came in a nice large bowl minus the broth that came in a separate container.  The broth was fresh and tasty.  The noodles were not the typical rice noodle but egg noodles.  Different but very flavorful.  I haven't had Pho this good since Ginseng 3 was open in Las Vegas.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"great drinks, food and customer service! We have been here a couple times this week already! Thai tea is my favorite. They also have good sandwiches and chicken and rice bowls.  Good environment with games to play and TVs playing the games."}
{"text":"This is a really nice hip place. It's very spacious. My friend and I came specifically for the boba. We told them it was our first time and they delightfully gave us suggestions. We ordered two fruity drinks. Although not made from real fruit they did not taste like syrup. My drink was pretty sour though. Maybe add more sugar.  As a tip you should add what they call \"white boba\" which I believe is lychee jelly in ball form. It taste good but remember it's extra."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying my very kind husband walked out saying, \"Well that was a painful experience.\"  I wanted something new and saw this place on Yelp. We decided to go in. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by what you would think was a night club. The music was so loud I couldn't even hear the employees talking to me. I asked if the flavored tea was brewed or flavored with syrup and they, I say they because there was five girls behind the counter even though we were the only customers, initially responded with, \"Tea is brewed from leaves.\" Right but how do you flavor it? After a couple minutes they figured out it was \"like a purée or something.\"   I then ordered a peach tea. They have something named a peachy but I didn't want any of the extra stuff so several times I had to iterate that I just wanted a tea with peach. My husband then ordered a coffee. They seemed awfully confused and after we paid stood around this pot of brewed coffee. I could barely overhear them say \"well this is from this morning. Can't we just use it?\" It was 1 pm. They used the old coffee.   My tea is fantastic but I don't foresee myself ever returning."}
{"text":"I love their signature drink with signature boba!  A touch of California to Arizona. Don't have to go to CA for my boba anymore."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good & the smoothies are awesome! The cold treats are the best during the hot AZ summer season. Planning on returning for more yummy treats!"}
{"text":"Original Milk Tea- da bomb! I drank that thing up!  My mom ordered the Sunrise Smoothie, and she felt the banana flavor was too strong, and it was too sweet. We won't get that again.  Next time, I want to try the thai tea!  The drinks were way more expensive than other places, so it will not be a regular for me.  However, the milk tea was very good, service was great, and it's a great place to catch up. The place is very large and clean.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time at Teabo was last night. Ordered 2 flavored tea with regular boba . It was delicious! So far my favorite that I had to get more today with my son. Ordered a slushie and flavor tea with boba for both! Couldn't leave without ordering popcorn chicken! Wished they served it with some type of sweet & sour sauce instead.  But it was delicious still! My favorite boba spot so far! In love with this place. Yall need to try it :)"}
{"text":"My sister and I came in kind of last minute so we couldn't order any food from the kitchen. But we got to order some iced tea (peachy and the triple) with Boba and a smoothie (Jack and jill) with Boba. The drinks are pretty good! I like the fact that they cut the fruits really small so you can actually get the fruits through the straw. Also got a couple of macaroons which were delicious! The staff was very nice even though we came in last minute and drinks came out quick. It is a very cute place. We will definitely come back again to try the food!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up our order with so much ease! We got the matcha green tea, atomic and blondie. All the drinks tasted so refreshing and not artificial at all. The boba is nice and chewy. As for the food the bbq pork bun was so cheap and tasty. The fried tofu was delicious but it's a small portion for the price.  Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Teabo is not just your boba tea / frozen drink place but they serve a wide selection of authentic Vietnamese sandwiches, rice bowls, rice plates, fresh rolls and of course Pho. Portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. Excellent customer service. Manager was very attentive, knowledgeable and explained to us their menu. Restaurant is modern and spotless- super clean. They have free WiFi and charging stations. Cool place to hang out for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"its the closest to cali boba tea drinks as it gets. but i wish they had a sweetened percentage option."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Has a nice modern look, and great vibes from the workers as well! This girl named Karina was very kind and help me choose out a boooooomb smoothie! Definitely coming back to try out their other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Horrible service! We purchased four drinks and one of the cups broke when my daughter put the straw in and they would no replace it. We had not even left the building.  I'm in awe of how they care so little for customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to pick up a quick meal that is quiet different from the ol burger and fries. I had the sandwich but I am anxious to try the noodles next time. My sandwich was so tasty and filling. The drinks are extra special with so many options to make a non-alcohol happy hour to get through your day. The actual space is so inviting as well. I highly recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"Good place to visit love there Macha tea!!! The employees are always nice and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I drove by Teabo last night & I knew I had to try this place  ASAP so I went in this morning & definitely was not disappointed. I was greeted by friendly, helpful staff, I wasn't sure what I wanted yet but was thinking I wanted something of smoothie texture. I asked if they maybe had a matcha green tea smoothie which they didn't but the the guy who was making the drinks kinda said he would make it for me which was so nice of him. It was delicious! My husband wanted an iced coffee, they let me know that it was Vietnamese coffee which is stronger & sweetened with condensed milk. He's never had Vietnamese coffee but also loved it! I will no doubt be coming back, I have a feeling I will be a regular here lol. The food also looked delicious! Friendly, accommodating staff, great drink & a modern atmosphere. You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"I liked the place it's not as over the top money wise as $$$bucks.... but I'll never get paying $4 for a cuppa Joe...and I'm not a cheap bastard ... The kids behind the counter, batista ' s I believe were quite pleasant. The music was loud but I liked it. All in all I will say cool joint but trying to recoup your intinal investment in the first two weeks is a good way to be closed in 2 months..... I do wish them success, any business in the west valley is good for all of us......"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food was really good. I order the pikachu drink. They had the pork and eggs there. No one else in az sells that besides cali. The cashier was very nice. She helped me set up the check in account so I can get free drinks . And told me there's certain days n times where I can get a discount."}
{"text":"This place is really cute way on the west side. Came here for a light lunch before watching a movie with 2 other Yelp friends. We all decided on various types of pho and the custard buns.  I was somewhat surprised to be asked if I wanted thick or thin noodles with my pho, I chose thin noodles which turned out to be the usual size. My friend chose thick noodles which were barely thicker than mine. They are not the wide flat chow fun type of noodle. So you can't go wrong with whatever size you choose.  I had a traditional beef broth variety which was pretty good although I found the broth to be on the sweet side. The custard buns are totally awesome and recommend 2 per person. Also on the plus side, you get a free drink dining in!"}
{"text":"I've never been on this side of town before and I'm glad I've stopped by there. I don't remember who was my cashier because I've receive service from everyone that has worked there. Food is delicious. I've been only getting Pho there for now. Now it time explore other things on the menu"}
{"text":"This place is really great - stop in for breakfast, lunch, or just a drink  Trendy little place w good Vietnamese food !!"}
{"text":"Super refreshing yummy teas! I've tried all and they taste yummy, with pieces of fruit in them and you can add bursting bubbles or boba. They have macaroons. Which are very soft and delish! Tried the bbq rice bowl and it's good also. Everything for a decent price. Teas about $4 bowls about $7. Macaroons $1. Fun games to hang out and have a good time."}
{"text":"Loving this place! Close to home, and convenient. Lots of parking is provided and the place is spacious, so crowds are really no big deal.   I've tried quite a few drinks here, some of the smoothies are a little bit too sweet for me, they leave that sticky syrupy feel in the back of your throat l, so I stick to the teas. The shaved ice is also really yummy, you can pick your flavors/fruits to add and the ice is so soft and gooey with condensed milk! It's a huge portion too! I've tried food items like popcorn chicken, their rices bowls  and fried tofu, all were also delightful and made to order!   Aside from that, the service is always exceptional, questions are always answered and recommendations are always provided. Andrea and I believe her name is Shannon, were the two memorable gals that have helped me have always kicked up great conversation, and have been really nice. You've got a regular on your hands Teabo!"}
{"text":"The customer service here SUCKS!!!  There is always 2 girls working the front iPAD registers & it appears that customers are not important to them.   The 1st time I went they got my order incorrect instead of a tea ended up giving me a Slushie.  Disappoinment.   2nd Disappointment:  I ordered a Slushie with Mango flavoring, instead they gave me the Mango boba not the flavoring.  Now this morning I go and I order and they don't have any Boba, after the fact she took the order and took my money.  So disappointed for a new local business."}
{"text":"First of all we didn't plan on having Pho and other dishes however we went in! We ordered 2-P4 Beef Brisket , 1-P3 Ribeye & Beef Brisket, Ribeye Sandwich, and braised pork with white rice. I could have rated this place 5 stars however the bread for the sandwich was pretty dense and cold and the noodles were overcooked. Everything from the service and the food was great! The broth was perfect! Clear and very flavorful. First ever we got to chose our noodles, either the thick rice noodles or the thin regular noodles. Great deal is that when purchasing any main entree you get a FREE milk tea of any type. We will be back again and again!! So good!!"}
{"text":"I got the pikachu with Boba. Best smoothie Boba I've had in a long time vs these generic Boba shops or added Boba smoothie selection shops that have been opening throughout the west valley."}
{"text":"A great spot for your boba fix.  They make decent food and drinks.    The \"experience\" still needs some work. Maybe it's the name that throws me off.  I came in expecting just drinks and small bites, but there's a ton more.  The highlight should be the food, then the drinks. Or maybe tone down on the food and focus on the drinks.. whatever it is, the identity of the shop seems kinda off.  If it's a fast casual for Banh Mi and Boba, it should be predominantly on the board menu display.  The menu looks like it's for a full service restaurant, so it's difficult and takes time to order something.  Everyone will always work their way around the other great food and drink as they choose.  The choices for add-ons are overwhelming.  Take a look at JT's menu for example.  Way too much going on.  Anyway, Oreo is unnecessary.  We just need one kind of tapioca.  When asked for which Boba, there should always only be one.  A good add-on menu is Boba, Egg Pudding, Milk Pudding, and one or two jellies.  The names of the drinks are funky.  I'm not sure if I like it.  For example, Green Machine should just be Avocado Smoothie (Sinh To Bo).  The food could use a price adjustment.  Everything is off by about a dollar more.  For example, Vermicelli (Bun) is around 8 bucks.  $6-$7 sounds more appropriate - 6.00 for Bun with one choice of Egg Rolls(Cha Gio), BBQ Pork(Thit Nuong), or Shrimp(Tom), 6.50 for two, or 7.00 for all three.  I had two smoothies, a Vermicelli, and a Popcorn Chicken and it came out to be $28, ouch.  A tad bit too much imo.  With all that said, this place makes some really, really great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Very delicious!!! Smoothies are made with fresh fruit!!! Matcha Tea!!!!! Delicious!!!! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The decor is beautiful. The atmosphere is cool and colorful. Unfortunately, the service was terrible and ruined everything for me. We ordered two meals, wings and two smoothies. As you can see by the receipt we didn't get one of the meals. We also didn't the correct smoothie. When we told the cashier that it was incorrect, she took it and went to have a conversation with her coworkers. Another cashier comes to our table and basically blames us for the mistake saying \"We will fix it this time, but from now on be sure to check your order on the screen to make sure its correct\". If a cashier error is something that will not be corrected when it is made that should be posted somewhere. I then asked where my sandwich was after waiting about 30 minutes (everything else had arrived) and looked at the receipt only to see that the cashier forgot to put it on there at all. The same rude cashier from before then came by and asked us if everything was ok. Clearly it was not. I couldn't even articulate myself at that point, so my husband held a conversation with her about what happened. She was then finally apologetic about everything that happened (I guess the cashier that screwed up must have admitted her error at this point). She was very pleasant to us afterwards. Unfortunately for me, it was too late."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is a little far from where I live but I always find it worth the drive. One of my favorite drinks is The Triple. It's very refreshing and just right. I've tasted a few of the food on the menu and they are by far pretty good. The ribeye sandwich I think is one of the best in the menu.   The place is very clean and big. It gives off a nice ambience. The staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions asked about the menu."}
{"text":"I've had the taro boba a while back and the taro flavored milk. It might just be me but the taro milk smells like this tropical plant called sampaguita flower ( jasmine sambac)... since to me it smells like it while I drink it, I can't help but feel weird drinking it. That flavor milk isn't bad but I'm not ecstatic about it. I've also had their pork buns and a grilled chicken with rice take out, and pork roll. I remember enjoying those but nothing I would go crazy about. Super friendly employees and would recommend others to try it out for themselves. I think you get a larger quantity for the price compared to other locations. It looks like they just started serving pho as well but I haven't tried that yet."}
{"text":"I love going to this restaurant for my morning coffee. The staff are always friendly and remember my order. Mariah was there today and greeted me with a smile. The food is also delicious. I love the lemon grass chicken! It's a great deal if you dine in, you get a free drink."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Drinks are super delicious and all their teas are fresh brewed, the signature boba is a must try! Andrea was super sweet, great group of people that south here. Owner is friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite must visit food places when I visit my mom in Phoenix!!! I wish they had one in Colorado where I live!!! Love their flavored teas with tapioca pearls! Also, their summer rolls, egg rolls, B.B.Q. pork buns, custard buns and shave ice. Clean facilities and friendly service!"}
{"text":"They make the best drink intown  and the food is awesome. Been here many of times and will always be back for years to come"}
{"text":"Love this place! Finally Goodyear is getting great and interesting places. The macaroons are fantastic and so are their smoothies with boba."}
{"text":"Their specialty tea is amazing!!!! Freshly brewed and not an instant powder drink. All you starbucks drinkers need to try this out.  You will absolutely love it.  I had the steak sandwich and it was so yummy. Great atmosphere to hang out and free WIFI."}
{"text":"Get down on one knee and do the Tebow for Teabo!  First, let's give Teabo an applause for showing the west valley some boba love. They got nothing out there west of the Loop 101. Secondly, non-dairy creamer? More clapping and cat-calling included. And lastly, food being served alongside boba? Respect and a wolf-whistle!  So we got our matcha milk tea with boba and we think they added coconut jelly to it. I'm not mad about this because our drinks were delicious, although a tad too sweet. I don't know why but as I had my matcha milk tea, I kept thinking about Tootsie Rolls. I dig. The drinks come large and it made me full and sleepy by the time I finished my drink. Comparing Tebo to other west valley boba shops, they're not bad!   Teabo is not the same as Tebo Tebo so don't get the two confused.  Shout out to Andrea for taking our order and answering all our dairy-related questions. Can I get my 10% off now? ;)"}
{"text":"The shaved ice is delicious, I loved the amount of flavors to choose from, and the fruit that was added onto it.  The macaroons were cold and had no flavor, however the the atmosphere and look of the establishment overall was great. I love that they had games and great music playing."}
