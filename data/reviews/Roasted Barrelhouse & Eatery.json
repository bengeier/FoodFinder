{"text":"A great niche, well executed.  Roasted is new, and recently renovated.  The decor shows real pride and attention to detail. The atmosphere is casual and fun.  Roasted takes its food seriously though.  I have stopped by three times and been very pleased each time.  The menu features sandwiches with house roasted meats.  There's also meatballs.   The sandwiches are moist and flavorful.  Meatballs are delightful, served with a tangy red sauce.  Service staff is friendly and knowledgeable.   Roasted hits on all cylinders."}
{"text":"Ok.  The place had a great design - lots of attention to detail in fixtures.  Nice feel.  Unfortunately the food was terrible.  The nachos were the worse I have ever had anywhere.  Canned cheese, no meat and cold chips out of a bag.  You must be kidding.  The beef  sandwich was bland and had alot of gristle.  Yes the decor and service was adequate but the food was terrible.  NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Edited my original 3 star post from August to write this 1 star post in November. I do not like Roasted. The food is not good, it comes out cold, and the menu is underwhelming and weird. They have some cool cocktails and friendly staff, but it's not worth it. 

I went there yesterday just for a drink and left REEKING of frying oil. I mean, even the inside of my purse stinks, the next day. I had to wash my hair twice. I had to wash my coat. Even just walking by the outside of the bar for a brief two seconds, all you can smell is cooking oil and wet dish rag. It is not an inviting food smell at all. It is incredibly off-putting. I understand that when the kitchen is in the dining area, like it is in Roasted, you are bound to run into this issue maybe a bit, but I'm not kidding when I say my entire entity smelled like greasy bar food for hours, and even still the next day."}
{"text":"The food seemed like it was probably really good when it was made fresh, but then it had been 
reheated. Veggies were way over cooked, potatoes were chewy and lukewarm, meatballs were lukewarm. Service was great though."}
{"text":"The pork on the Italian roasted pork sandwich was cold and too salty.  The service was a little slow as well.  The cost was a little pricy for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!  Now one of my favorite spots in Lawrenceville.  I love the small bar outside on the sidewalk -for outside seating at the bar.. easy to belly up too or inviting an eye catcher if you are passing by.  The d√©cor inside is what I like the best. .. cozy 2 person only woodsy booths line the one red brick wall --  nice and intimate for two people. In the rear of the restaurant you will discover more tables and cozy booths along the wall (standard size) and a jukebox even!!  Drink menu - cocktails and high balls .. so any unique names and blends.  Sometimes it's tough to decide and so nice when it's all there for you.. just choose.  The bartender was extremely helpful giving us the lowdown on all the drinks.  RBE has a lot of personality and I cannot wait to go back and try out the food, which I heard was good.  Unfortunately, we already ate dinner beforehand.  It was a fun evening out with one of my closest girlfriends but I must tell you....this place is screaming \"date night\" because of the quaintness.  I will no doubt be back to experience that.   Thanks Roasted Barrelhouse & Eatery!"}
{"text":"The remodeling was beautifully done. Five stars for ambiance and decor. Pittsburgh industrial mixed with new-Lawrenceville charm. They have a few bar stools on the sidewalk, which I always enjoy. I did not get a chance to experience the food, but the menu looks delicious! 

The drink menu was expansively filled with delicious sounding drinks. However, I wouldn't know because the bartender decided to serve me only non-alcoholic beverages (without telling me, mind you) as he thought I was too drunk. It was my first bar of the night, and I was perfectly fine! So a. worst bartender ever and b. good luck having a bar survive that doesn't serve moderately drunk twenty-something year olds. 

Bye, Roasted. I'll be across the street at Round Corner with the rest of the city."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  My husband and I had a babysitter for the night and I had been wanting to try this place for a while, so we made a date of it.  I started with the chili as I couldn't resist the idea of \"corn bread croutons\".  Except there weren't any.  Apparently, they had run out a few hours before and hoped I wouldn't notice.  

I ordered the brisket sandwich for my meal and my husband ordered the Dunkirk.  Seeing that his sandwich came on a Caraway roll, I asked if there was any Caraway, Fennel or Anise in anything on the Brisket sandwich as was told \"no\".  (I seriously hate anything that tastes like black licorice!!)  When the food arrived, there was Caraway seed all through the sauerkraut!!  I would have sent it back, but our server was pretty much non-exsistent.  

I gave this two stars as my husband said that his sandwich was acceptable. 

Sad that I wasted a precious date night here.  There are too many other great restaurants in Pittsburgh - we won't be back."}
{"text":"So my fiance and I decided to check this place out since it's in our neighborhood. 
We had already eaten so we just wanted to get some cocktails. They moved in to where Eclipse once was, busted out the old block windows and opened the space up. I was interested in seeing what the inside would look like now with those old (quirky) windows gone). 
We perused the menu and each settled on a drink. 
I got the:  Maime Taylor - Dewar's, Lime Juice, Ginger Ale
The fiance got the:  English  - Gin, Brandy, Sweet Vermouth, Lemon Twist
Both of us opted for the \"Tall\" of each at $10.00 a piece. 

I took a sip of my drink, sorry not the best thing I've ever tasted. It was REALLY heavy on the ginger ale, the lime juice tasted metallic, and the Dewars was barely a side note. The ginger ale tasted very cheap and syrupy (maybe I've been spoiled drinking ginger beer with my whiskey, maybe i was LONGING for a ginger beer), the lime could not have been fresh squeezed, it tasted like Rose's Lime Juice. I suppose maybe I was thinking this would taste a bit like an Irish Mule or something. It didn't. So I took a sip of my fiance's English, fresh tasting, albeit a little weak. That's okay. The fiance tasted mine and his, said \"I think they switched our drinks\" I informed him no, mine DEFINITELY had Dewars in it, it was just barely there. The bartender overheard us and said \"yeah that's definitely the whiskey one!\" I'm one of those girls that enjoys a good whiskey cocktail and I was a bit disappointed in our chosen drinks. We both were a bit dissatisfied and decided to move onward down the road. 

I think we'll go back and try dinner, I like to give places a \"fair shake\"."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends. We sat on the outdoor bar stools, which was  pleasant in this weather. The service was excellent and they have generous happy hour drinks specials. Their old fashioned was up to par. 

Okay, so why the two stars? The food was just not good. I got the French dip lamb sandwhich. It was dry and flavorless despite being bathed in au jus and had a sad little tomato on it. I also got the Mac n cheese, which was meh. My fellow dinners were also unimpressed with their meals.

Will not be going back for food. Might go back for happy hour if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Meh. Not awful. Not great. Didnt really give me a reason to come back."}
{"text":"So my husband and I came here with my brother and sister-in-law for dinner. To be fair the location is nice but the food and service were awful. So first we ordered a decaf coffee which came 20 minutes later and then my husband ordered an iced tea but apparently they ran out..:.how do you even run out of iced tea?? I probably should've taken it as a cue to leave but we persevered. Yeah that was a mistake. So then my sister-in-law asked for Italian dressing on her side salad and they didn't have that so she went with another choice, pomegranate. When she got her salad it had ranch on it. I ordered lamb which was supposed to come with tomatoes, feta, and taziki sauce. Literally what came where thin cold slices of a meat that tasted more like it was bought frozen at giant eagle and microwaved. My sister-in-law got the brisket which was also cold and pink (maybe meant to be that way?) and my brother got chicken which appeared to be the most normal. After waiting as long as we did for the food I would've hoped for it to be better....and cheaper. Not coming here again but we did have a good laugh at the experience."}
{"text":"3 1/2 to 4 stars... This place is pretty solid. Not sure how we've missed it in the past, but stopped here for some drinks and sat at the bar. You can see the chef from the bar area and it is evident how hard she works, being the only one back there. I tried the beet sad and we shared the mezza platter. It came it relatively quick and the spreads on the mezza platter were well rounded enough that they all separated and stood out from one another in a nice way. The beet salad was fresh and delicious. Walnuts and feta (?) cheese accompanied the salad with a few cabbage straws, which added the perfect crunch. Bar company and wait staff were friendly and I was surprised to see how cheap the beers were- avg. of $5 each. There seemed to be a party upstairs and a second room in the first floor that seats even more people- a pretty large space. The only downsides I saw were the was no TP in the ladies bathroom and there was only one restroom. I would love to return and check out more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great stop for a drink or two in the Lawrenceville area of Pittsburgh.  They have some good brews on draft, though not an extensive selection for beer enthusiasts, but just right for thirsty folks...and a pretty gnarly selection of cocktails and libations.  It's a welcome place to start a pub crawl or simply sit and catch up with friends and/or loved ones in a trendy, yet not pretentious bar setting.  

If the weather is right, you can enjoy some outdoor seating that opens \"into\" the restaurant as a street side bar as well.  

I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to start a fun night on Butler St."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after husband drove by on his way home from work and thought it would be worth a try. Service was good, beer selection not bad and food was just OK. 

I had the beef brisket sandwich (their #1 seller) and it was delicious and hot, although it was also so sloppy and messy that I could not pick it up and had to attack with my knife and fork. Husband went with their meatball version \"dip\" and did not enjoy it as the meatballs were pretty sub-par and the dipping sauce \"marinara\" that came with it was too sweet and not very good. We also had the loaded potatoes as an appetizer.  They came out cold (should have sent them back) and were nothing special - the smallman street fries at Primantis in comparison, are 1000x better than these were. Claimed that they were potato wedges with chili and beer cheese - that is not what we received, as the cheese sauce tasted like it was probably from a can and the potatoes were soggy, cold and chili was nothing to write home about. I wouldn't recommend them. 

Overall, a tad pricey for cold food that wasn't great We wont be back. Lots of better places in the area to eat."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was below average. Bartender  seemed to be overwhelmed and the place was potentially understaffed. It was a Monday holiday. There were 17 guests total in the place and there was with no help for my bartender. It left me feeling unsatisfied and I will probably will not try this place again on my only day off without kids. We stopped in because Cantina was closed. Atmosphere was awesome and I really liked the setup and decor. It was very clean."}
{"text":"Go for drinks and beer.  Not for food.
They have an awesome list of drinks and an extensive list of great beer.  The bartenders are friendly and conversational which is always nice.  The atmosphere is cool.  We have really enjoyed just sitting at the bar and having drinks.
The food, however, is just underwhelming.  They have a really limited menu which typically indicates a restaurant only focuses on what they're great at.  We both got the chicken sandwich and split potato wedges and neither were good.  Everything was cold, which maybe is how they intend to serve food?
All in all we'd definitely come back for drinks."}
{"text":"Holy enormous change from Eclipse, Batman.  They've done a great job with the remodel, so on to the food....the meatballs were amazing.  Seriously seriously fantastic.  The roast beef sandwich was also great, complete with a side of au jus.  The macaroni and cheese was decent, if not great.  Service was outstanding and very friendly.  I wouldn't necessarily bust my behind to get here ASAP, but it's a nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side of potato wedges.  Both were cold and the potatoes had the strangest seasoning I ever tasted, really bad.  I've had better roast beef at Arbys."}
{"text":"REALLY good food. Bartender Adam is awesome. Service is super quick. I definitely recommend the shrimp po boy and roasted potatoes."}
{"text":"Loved Roasted! The Dunkirk sandwich was delicious with roast beef of the perfect consistency and tasty bread. Get the mac & cheese and roasted veggies for apps."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious drinks. We sat in a booth, which we liked other than the fact that the rooted benches were too far apart from the table.

We ordered the Buffalo-style wings as an appetizer. Note they're healthier as they're oven baked, not fried. Unfortunately, this means they're not crispy, which is what we're used to. Pass.

The French dip sandwiches, however, were so good! My husband had the roast beef, and I had the brisket. The roasted potatoes were good too (though they weren't warm)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live pretty close to this place and we really, really wanted to like this place but we gave them 4 shots and pretty much every visit/takeout order we had was screwed up in some way. Everyone here is super nice though, and the drinks we've had were great. 

Our first visit was during their soft opening, we tried the mac & cheese, the Dunkirk roast beef sandwich, and the Smoked Beef Brisket sandwich. The sandwiches were great, we got half orders which were more than enough for us and also a good deal for $7 - $8. However right before our orders came up, the waitress told my boyfriend that they were out of fries and it would be 20 min until new ones were ready. Our sandwiches were about to come out, and my boyfriend didn't like any of the other side options, so he ordered veggies instead and I ate those. I had coleslaw as my side, and it was kind of dry and tiny. We had ordered mac and cheese as an app, but it never came out so we asked the waitress about it and we were told they accidentally gave ours to another table. The mac and cheese came out after we were almost done with our main meals. The mac and cheese was good, not anything amazing, but good. The waitress apologized for the mistakes and we understood it was a soft opening, so no big deal.

We later decided to get a whole Dunkirk sandwich to go one night to share. We ordered over the phone, however when we went to pick up our order the cooks said they never saw it and hadn't started making it. When we got home, the sandwich wasn't as good as the previous one, there was less meat, and the meat was fattier. We got an order of fries too which were soggy. Fries can be hard to time right for a take-out item I guess though. We decided it was still pretty close to their soft opening so we'd give them another try.

I ordered take-out another night and I had to call 3 times before someone would answer the phone. Then when someone answered I started talking and was immediately placed on hold, without anyone saying they were placing me on hold. When I was able to order, I was told they were out of the Smoked Beef Brisket sandwich, so I ordered the Chicken Lickin' sandwich. I was not asked what side I'd like, so I never got one. I also ordered mac and cheese. When I got home, the sandwich was cold (I live about 1 min from this place) and the mac and cheese was coagulated, like it was old and had been reheated. It was not creamy like it was the first time I had it. The chicken sandwich was my least favorite sandwich I've tried. I found it to be dry and the coleslaw didn't add much to it. I felt like it needed something else, cheese or sauce, etc. Lesson learned - take-out here probably isn't going to be as good as eating in.

The last time we dined in here we received our menus and parts of the menu were blacked out with sharpie, which looked kind of unprofessional. We got the Dunkirk roast beef sandwich again, and the Smoked Beef Brisket sandwich. My boyfriend got a whole order this time, and the waiter only brought out a half order. We reminded the waiter that he got a whole order and the rest of the sandwich was brought out. We also didn't receive napkins or utensils until about 10 min after our plates came out, after the second half of the sandwich was brought over. My boyfriend said his sandwich was again not as good as our first visit and some of the meat was fatty. My sandwich was good, and as well as my veggies. However, I feel like there shouldn't be an up-charge for fries/veggies as a side. The tiny coleslaw and sauerkraut you get as a free side, are hardly sides.

Overall we really tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt, however there just have been too many screw ups. As said earlier, we really wanted to see this place work out its kinks. The menu is not that large, and there are always plenty of cooks working and the food seems pretty easy to assemble since it's mostly sandwiches that need assembled, toasted, etc. The drinks are good though, so perhaps we'll be back for those. My other thoughts were that there are no options for vegetarians, and I didn't agree with the up-charge for the sides. However the sandwiches themselves are a good deal for the size you get."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was underwhelmed.

The atmosphere was cool, and the location was on point, and I'll even go as far as to say that the service was good. But the menu was so boring to me. Now, to be fair, I didn't pick this place and I was in the mood for DINNER, so maybe if I was more flexible with my meal requirements that night it would've been different. But all I know is that I wasn't impressed. 

They sell \"specialty\" French dip sandwiches, which I wasn't impressed with. The concept is cool sometimes (grilled cheese all the way!), but it just didn't do it for me. The selection wasn't appetizing to me, and I was really disappointed in the lack of other options. So, if I don't want a French dip sandwich, I'm basically out of luck. 

I don't know, maybe I'm being a diva here, but I didn't like it. That's all."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars...My wife and I were just looking for a new spot to grab a couple drinks on our anniversary weekend. We stumbled apon RB&E. The bar was nice had a few tvs. A good amount of draft and bottled beers, as well as an unique cocktail list. I enjoyed a few white lightnings, my wife had a raspberry beer to go along with her beet salad and mezza board. The mezza board had an assortment of cheeses, spreads, and breads. My favorite spread being the grape stone ground mustard. I am not a fan of beets but she loved it. If we are ever back in this area we would stop in again.

 The only drawbacks I would say is the atmosphere was good not great and the men's bathroom had a weird setup. It was confusing if it was a single restroom or not."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fairly quick service were what we were looking for to head off a toddler melt down created in part by poor planning and long lines elsewhere. We got both here at Barrelhouse. We tried three different sandwiches - pork with broccoli rabe, meatball, and roast beef with horseradish - and all were very good. Tops in my mind was the meatball which were super flavorful! Currently they don't offer half sandwiches so portions were pretty big. We also had the potatoes but they were just okay and surprisingly the portions size was small for an appetizer. Overall we got lucky happening upon a pretty good and filing meal."}
{"text":"Great drinks, friendly service, and awesome atmosphere. It's great to have an option for affordable food and cocktails in lower Lawrenceville. Since we live nearby, my boyfriend and I frequent this place several times a week and are always welcomed. The bar staff know their stuff and if you can't make up your mind about their list of like, 20+ different cocktails they will gladly fix you anything you want. Sure the draft list isn't enormous, but if that's what you want you can go to Industry, where you will be fighting for the bartender's attention forever and your only other options are bizarre and poorly-mixed cocktails. At Roasted, they care that you enjoy your food and your drinks with zero pretense. In the time that we have been going they have changed their menu quite a bit to try and improve options and recipes, because they listen to feedback. No-Brainers include the Mac and cheese, the nachos, and the verona. For drinks, don't miss the Parisian Connection, their perfect Pisco Sour and my personal fav, El Diable."}
{"text":"The best beef brisket sandwich I have ever had! The meatballs were excellent as well. I can't wait to come back and try the mac and cheese. Nice laid back atmosphere and it's right across the street from Round Corner Cantina another Lawrenceville favorite.:-)"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in while doing a Lawrenceville bar/restaurant crawl one Saturday after we discovered Allegheny Wine Mixer wasn't open till 4PM. Both of us weren't all that impressed. I asked what the drink of the day was and I was told they were out of the ingredients. Which seems odd since it was only 2PM. I went with another drink off the menu and it was extremely overpriced in my opinion for the size. The drink itself wasn't all that impressive either. Just glancing at the food menu nothing really jumped out at me and made want to order anything. I probably wouldn't go back to try the food either."}
{"text":"Finally stopped here for food after an initial visit for beer. Their beer selection is just OK - craft beer lovers, don't hold your breath.

I had a half brisket/reuben sandwich and found it to be mediocre. The bread was uninspiring, the brisket seemed like it had been boiled, the sauce so-so, and the dipping sauce seemed like it could have been good if paired with a sandwich that wasn't subpar.

The outdoor bar-stool seating area is cool -- it's something that draws you into this place. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be back for the lackluster food."}
{"text":"Perfect addition to LOLA. The newly restored interior is beautiful and you can really tell the amount of work the owners put into this place.

Great cocktail list, but the draft list was subpar. I understand that they are trying to \"go local\" for the beer list, but I prefer quality beers over local selections. 

I like how the menu is creative and branches away from Pittsburgh oversaturated burger and shake market. Menu is a variety of different BBQ/roasted meat sandwiches. Ordered the lamb - flavorful and the half size is filling enough there is no need to order sides."}
{"text":"Really nice interior, has the old school tavern feel.  There are about 4 outdoor stools that connect to the inside but a little to cold these days to try those, anyway seats with backs are more comfy.  I liked the fact that you can get a half or whole sandwich.  A half is pretty large and we were having a late lunch so did not want to over eat that this time.  A good place for a good sandwich on Breadworks bread and slow roasted cooking.  The Italian Roasted pork is a house made Porchetta, with Provolone and Braised Rapini served with some au jus.  While the sandwich was different than some of the Italian Pork sandwiches I have had in Chicago and locally, it was very good with some sweetness and a little spice flavor.  Definitely a good place for a sandwich and a beer or cocktail.
The service was fast and super friendly, too."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic experience at Roasted.  I had the pork sandwich, which was on point.  The dipping sauce was the perfect exclamation point to a wonderful dish.  My wife had the mac and cheese and a side of meatballs and loved them both. 

In addition to food, our cocktails were executed perfectly and the staff was super friendly.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I stopped in on a whim and had two cocktails that were ok. They weren't horrible but they weren't perfect either. We were with friends that ordered different cocktails and they absolutely disliked them. It wasn't really that busy but maybe the bartender just wasn't having a good night. I'll give this place another shot."}
