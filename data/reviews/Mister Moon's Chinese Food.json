{"text":"Very basic hole in the wall chinese food. The general tsao chicken was neon orange and slimy. The tai dop voy had mostly vegetables. The rice was ok ,but in general,the quality low and price high"}
{"text":"We are fairly new to the area and love authentic chinese food. We decided to give Mister Moon's a try after reading the reviews. I called to place an order for pick up and when I asked what the cost was at the end of the call the woman on the phone literally huffed in annoyance. Once my husband came home with $25 worth of food we were beyond disappointed. We ordered the beef and peppers and weren't necessary expecting to have green peppers with a small side of beef. Food is bland and tasteless. Probably one of the worst chinese food restaurant I've had. If you love authentic chinese food pass this place! If you are ever in the Bayview and Hwy 7 are, visit NEW CHOICE RESTAURANT. They do take-our, are open late and have the guaranteed best food you've had. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Finally discovered a decent Chinese take out - I swear the food here cures all ailments!  Love it!  Not 5 stars cause they dont honor the spend 20, get 10% off anymore...."}
{"text":"I give this place 2.5-3 stars. It's very average, really cheap, portions are okay but it's definitely not authentic. We were really hungry and the lunch menu was only 7.59 or something. I ordered Cantonese chow mein and the vegetables were nice and crunchy but the noodles weren't really chow Mein noodles. My friend got the Singapore Noodles which were too dry. I'd probably go Tim Hortons instead next time."}
{"text":"Decided to visited here last night for hot n sour soup. I've been here before back in 2011. The food was good but I barely remember it now. I ordered the soup and sat there waiting. The place is pretty clean and the service was good. The lady was nice and explained what was in the soup. I didn't feel rushed. The soup itself was pretty good. I'd visit here again and recommend. They offer free delivery on orders of $20 in and around oak ridges. They have daily specials and monthly specials for 4. March 25----Wowowowow. I got delivery tonight which consisted of hot n sour soup(which I still love from there) general Tao chicken and vegetable lo mein. I was so disappointed. $25 down the drain. The chicken was very bland and same with the noddles. Nobody in the house likes this food. Im really pissed off but I'll only be getting the hot n sour soup from now on. Lesson learned. The reviewer below is very accurate in describing the taste of this food, or lack of."}
{"text":"Non authentic Chinese food.  Meant for non Asian customers that still order sweet and sour something.  Food is very greasy.  Use a quarter of the amount of oil when stir frying.  Expect this quality of Chinese Food in the middle of nowhereville, USA."}
{"text":"Food is great for the price yet the place needs a redecorating for sure. Friendly staff and they sell beer as well  Awsome job guys   Just wanted bigger portions"}
{"text":"I ordered Mister Moon's based on reviews I found on google AND out of desperation for want of Chinese delivery in my area.  The google reviews in this case were pretty bang on.  The food was very clean (not greasy) and tasty.  The service was prompt.  Ordering via phone was easy.  The selection on the menu is good.    The portions are generous."}
{"text":"Mister moon comes to the rescue on a Friday night after a busy week. I called a head to place my order and true to their word food was ready for pick up. Food is hot and freshly made.  Family favourite Cantonese Chow Mein and General Tao Chicken. Pay cash save 10%. Spend $45-$50 get free box of chicken wings. Good food, generous portions and best part I got a night off from cooking......... Yeh!"}
{"text":"Narrative review?  That awkward day of the week. You've worked way too hard at the office, you're home late and don't have the energy to cook a meal. But you're starved..... you do what you know is pointless - look up delivery places online in north richmond hill that really boil down to one option past 9.30 pm.....pizza.....but you know it's not good for you and you're trying to shed those extra pounds. Should you order the closest thing to a healthy meal? Perhaps some chinese loading up on the veggies? But Golden Hoy keeps messing up your order and really isn't that good.......for no apparent reason you google delivery richmond hill once again.....but lo and behold, a new restaurant pops up for the first time. Mr. Moons.... the urban spoon reviews are good....but why hasn't anyone on yelp reviewed it yet? Menu looks good - with some traditional chinese dishes and lots of spicy dishes. You order - mr.moon is really good to you on the phone. You are delighted you don't have to rush your order in 5 syllable sentences for a change. Delivery comes fast. No credit card? ok you fish out the extra bucks for the change and tip out of a jar.....you forgot people still use cash sometimes.  You dig in. Disappointment sets in. Where's the flavour? Why are components burnt? I this really a spicy dish? Why do all the dishes taste the same? Who in their right minds thought this was good food on urbanspoon?  you understand why there are no yelp reviews. you give up eating and dream of an amazing late night restaurant opening down the street from you. if wishes were ferraris......."}
