{"text":"I went here for lunch the other weekday.  I'm Celiac, so had scoped out their online menu and designated gluten free options in advance.  I ordered a gluten free burger, however when I double checked when it was brought to my table (thank goodness I always do this) it wasn't gluten free.  The gentleman (manager, I think) was extremely apologetic, and had it completely remade to avoid contamination.  My server also came over and apologised, and I just let her know I would have been very sick if I'd eaten it.  The gluten free burger came out and was good.  When I paid my bill I noticed they'd proactively taken 25% off, which was nice. Oh, and no surcharge that I saw for gluten free, which is a rarity.

Overall, they handled a mistake very professionally, and I compliment them on that.  However, I probably won't go back often, and will certainly avoid busy times to ensure no errors/cross contamination."}
{"text":"Drove all the way there from Airdrie and arrived at around 4pm on a Saturday and they were not open...apparently due to the nhl lockout they open and close as they choose according to the manager. We'd already paid for parking and were out that money.  Their response...the open sign wasn't on.  Their website posted their hours and we advised them to update them. We won't go back.  The \"manager\" had a piss-poor attitude.  This review was from back in December, but I doubt much has changed based on what we saw the day we tried to give them business when they were complaining they didn't have any."}
{"text":"Ya knoooow, here's the thing.  Loungeburder is like that old joke: \"doctor, it hurts when I do this\", so the doctor says \"then stop doing that\".  But you just can't.  

Waiting for your food to arrive at Loungeburger is painful; it is that slow.  I went there for lunch yesterday with a friend - I ordered the feature lunch and she ordered soup of the day and fries.  Easy peasy.  Or not because nearly an hour later we were still waiting for our food.  We ended up having to take the food back to work and eat at our desks.  Not impressed.  The manager tried, he really did, you could tell he was busy and flustered.  He knocked 15% off our bill and gave us gift certificates for next time (which, funnily enough, took another 10 minutes to get).  What I didn't appreciate was him saying that our food was so slow because we were stuck behind 2 large tables.  I've been there about 6 times - and there has been a long wait for food each time.  I'm not one for excuses.

The problem is that I find the food just so good!  I've personally not had a bad meal there yet.  The yam fries are salty greatness and the burgers are delish!  The beef stew special yesterday was excellent.  So, yeah, I'm a sucker for the food & I keep getting sucked back, no matter how peeved I get at their crap service.  

It's hard to come up with a rating for Loungeburger since it's so bipolar.  I suppose if you have time to kill, sit down & have a few drinks while you wait for your food to show.  If not, I would say don't bother!"}
{"text":"Food is good but restaurant is always closed early and never open till the hours thats posted.  Have gone there 3 times twice on wednesday night at 9pm and the hours say open 11-late and they were closing, once on Sunday at 7pm and the staff said they were closing. Very inconsistant"}
{"text":"I went there with my family. They had lots to choose from and might use better quality ingredients, but taste was not that great. Expensive, too. Steak sandwich was not a kind of Philly Cheese Sandwish but was actually steak. Burger was not juicy at all."}
{"text":"Horrible service and worse food. Had the \"Kobe\" burger. Wagyu Kobe beef and it was the driest burger I've ever had in a restaurant, nevermind a high end burger restaurant.  When I mentioned it to the very inexperienced waitress she said she would see coming back 10 minutes later not with a manager or someone to look at it but with an offer of 15% off. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Try Dairy Queen for a better burger for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service.   
I even had to chase down my  beer after all my buddies were served   40 minutes and no burger!!  Once the burgers got here Wow.   Outstanding taste. Good portion of sides for all. I will return"}
{"text":"Biggest shit hole I've been in a long time came here a 4:00 in the afternoon for a pint while waiting to get picked up. Told they are booked with 2 large parties the place is empty. By they way so u asked if we can just get a pint  at the bar while I wait. They said they couldn't do that so I asked to speak with the manager. The lady at the front went to inform here but the manger told her she couldn't be bothered. Great customer service. If I could give zero stars I would do not come here these are a bunch of stuck up wankers"}
{"text":"I ordered the bison burger, I was told it's made with lean(er) beef, and it's true! A lot of places do make good burgers, I'd say this place does make exceptionally yummy burgers! The lunch comes with the option of salad or fries or onion rings, I ordered the house salad to try to counter the grease.
Normally, burger restaurants only offer mediocre salad, but not this place. The house salad got toasted walnut, and mixed berries. Very little dressing is added just the way I like it. 

May be I came here with a very low expectation, but it surely amazed me! If I'm going back to Calgary, I'll try to make my way here to try other burgers again. I wish I took some pictures of the meal, unfortunately I was on a business trip, it looks silly to be taking pictures of my food ...."}
{"text":"Went to loungeburger to watch the hockey game and grab a \"burger\". We sat down in an almost empty bar. Was given water and menus. Waitress came back after 5 min and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. we said no. big mistake, as she never came back to take our food order. i was starving, and so was my buddy. She took an order of a table next to us who was seated after us, chatted with one more table. cleaned another all while we were waiting for service. 20 min later we complained to the manager and walked out. it was extremely obvious our waitress, laura, didnt want to serve us as we were not drinking. avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Started off with the calamari, the boyfriend liked the flavours, but I didn't like it as much.  Most of the rings were soggy so it ruined the whole dish for me.  

The Bison Burger is amazing.  Definitely a must for our return.  Everything blends so well together, the meat is so tender.
I ordered the tiger shrimp burger because someone recommended it on beyond.  I personally didn't like it because they had a sweet thai/viet (?) with peanut sauce on it.  And the shrimps were over seasoned with salt.  
The burger are quite big that we were leaking everywhere!  

I would go back for the bison burger and to try the others.  The service was great.  He constantly got complaints from the other table and they were sending food back like mad but he was still smiling at us.
The decor is really classy and dark.  

Overall, it's alright;  not something I would be craving all the time (like sushi *drools)

PS. do not try the dessert burger out of curiousity...it's disgusting, unique, but disgusting."}
{"text":"I went to Loungeburger for the first time the other evening.  I'd heard they had a few vegetarian choices, and I'm always excited to find a vegetarian meal that comes with fries on the side (newsflash: not all vegetarians are health freaks!).  

I ordered the veggie burger, which the online menu describes as \"freshly grated grilled vegetables, hand formed and served with roasted red pepper aioli on a chipotle cheddar bun\".  This is NOT the current description on the in-store menu, nor does it, or the in-store menu, accurately reflect what I was served.  Basically, someone sliced some vegetables into long, thin strips on a mandolin, roasted them, tossed them with balsamic glaze, topped them with feta and put them on a whole-wheat bun (which also had oddly-crunchy lettuce, plus non-roasted tomatoes and mayo).   I took the crunchy stuff off the bun and enjoyed the grilled vegetable sandwich, despite my disappointment that it wasn't actually a \"veggie burger\".  I ordered the fries that were described as \"spicy curly\" (or something) and I'm pretty sure they were McCains SuperFries, but again, as a vegetarian it was still a nice treat.  

There were a few mix-ups with other meals at our table (not mine, luckily), and I definitely felt our server could have used a bit more training in both the menu and appropriate social skills, but I actually suspect I'll go back to Loungeburger in the future as it seems like a decent place to grab a casual bite when your group has diverse tastes."}
{"text":"Very poor, disappointing experience all around. We will not be returning.
We came at 7pm on a Thursday; only a few tables occupied. The first thing I noticed was the proliferation of televisions showing the sports channel. Not what I expected. 
The server greeted us, but not in a friendly manner. Then we waited almost 5 minutes to be taken to our seat. There seemed to be only two wait staff, neither of whom was in any particular hurry.  After we ordered, it took 40 minutes to get our food (two burgers, one order of waffle fries and fried pickles) during which time, we did not have our drinks refilled. Nor did the server let us know why the order was taking so long. The fried pickles were good, but $7 for 5 spears of dill pickle is steep. The waffle fries are good, but we did not get any ketchup. My husband got up to look for some since no staff was in sight, but had no luck. We asked one of the servers for ketchup, and she said \"Okay\" in the same dismissive tone as she had greeted us. Like she was doing us a favour.  The ketchup never came. Our server did come by once to see how the food was. She was cheerful enough, but an extremely poor server. No skills at all. Obviously hired for her looks and long blonde hair which she repeatedly played with. Also, maybe I am old-fashioned, but I do not think it is appropriate for an employee's bra straps to be in full view under her tank top. The burgers were not worth $14! Tasteless meat, dry bun. The \"Black and Blue burger\" featured blue cheese, but there were only a few crumbles in the centre. The \"Big Kahuna\" tasted more of mayonnaise than pineapple and teriyaki sauce.
So...we went because we had a livingsocial voucher and had been looking forward to trying somewhere new to us. The only reason we left any tip at all was so the server would not think we were cheap jerks using a coupon.  
Save your money and go to fatburger!  Better burger, cheerful service. Shame on you, loungeburger. One of the worst dining experiences ever."}
{"text":"Honestly horrible. 
My boyfriend and I went to this burger joint for a quick bite to eat and ended up leaving before even receiving a menu. 
We were not greeted at the door, a lady behind the bar just pointed in the general direction of the lounge and said \"sit anywhere\". We waited 10 minutes for a server to come and take at least our drink order while we waited for menus.....this didn't happen. Instead the server came by and attempted to put cutlery on the dirty table, before saying \"oops, dirty table I'll clean it off in a minute\"......10 minutes later the table was still dirty, no drink orders were taken and as for receiving a menu, well we never did get one. We ended up leaving. I'm
Sure the food is good but the service was awful."}
{"text":"If you like over priced burgers and beers and a million televisions all around you this is the place to be. What drives me nuts in the commercials, if you are going to watch TV and commercials you might as well stay home people. The burgers are not bad but dry, I've been here twice and twice was too many times. They went wrong with this place, its too chick and fancy for a place that sells burgers and beers...come on!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing and relaxed. Sad to see so many bad reviews. Great location, great beer and AMAZING WAFFLE FRIES! went earlier tonight and service was exactly what you expect, was hoping for my usual ARTIST waitress who is down to earth, wasn't there but usually she is and has a smile like no other. Shes quick and witty server been working there for years! (Don't know her name) Lounge Burger is calgary a reliable and non pretentious spot to eat and dine!"}
{"text":"As I wait for my food which I ordered an hour ago, I must say that the service is quite slow. Although I did enjoy some onion rings the waitress brought over that were intended for a different table. I got here around 1 o'clock and they took our drink and after waiting 30 minutes for them to arrive they final arrived. Now it is almost 3 and the food is just arriving."}
{"text":"We had been trying to go for some time, but kept finding it full. This only added to our anticipation, which was sadly disappointed. I was the first customer through the door on a Friday afternoon at 11:30, and thought I was would get a head start by asking the bartender what \"hoppy\" beer they had. He had no idea what I was talking about. The waitress excused this by saying he was new, but, hey - he's a bartender! I asked her my question and she responded with \"Grasshopper!\", which is the furthest thing from hoppy that you can get but was, at least, creative. 

Both appetizers we tried were the standard pub fare that arrives pre-made at every establishment in the known world, but we came for the burgers, so weren't too concerned. To our surprise, however, these were completely pedestrian. The buns were billed as \"brioche\", which was attempt to fancify the word bun, but did not describe the ball of indifference enrobing the burger. The Greek burger didn't really have anything on it that would help differentiate it from a burger from any other country save perhaps the garlic in the meat. The Kobe burger was just a weird concept to begin with, because isn't the reason for Kobe beef its tenderness? - why grind it? Each of us tried the other's meal at the halfway point, as is our habit, but didn't find a compelling reason to switch - or even finish - our meal. Although we didn't complain, two levels of management came by to indicate their concern that we weren't thrilled; the second suggested we \"try something else next time\" and gave us his business card. Um, thanks.

I went to use the washroom before leaving and found a lovely facility which unfortunately had no paper towels (we were the first customers, remember) and an LED sign at the exit that was apparently calculated to ensure you left the WC with a smile on your face. It said: \"Your toddler just put salami in the Blu-Ray\". Guess what, Lounge Burger? When I go to the bar with my husband, it is to forget that I have toddlers - not to wonder what they might be doing while I am there.

Lounge Burger has no nearby competition, and this is apparently the secret of its success. The last time we couldn't get in, we hiked all the way to La Chaumiere where, despite our casual garb and backpacks, we were treated like royalty and fed likewise. Save your pennies and go there."}
{"text":"Whatever. Just another LA style build your burger joint, without the flavor and value that you'd get in LA. It would have been more fun if every ingredient, like pickles and mayonnaise, were not an additional $1. 

They refused to prepare the burger rare. The burger that came out was,  meh. If I'm paying for avocado, I'd like more than a quarter of one on the burger. The bun was not very good and way larger than the burger (maybe because I only got three condiments: egg, mayo, avocado). The egg had a very deep yellow yolk (darker = fresher) but was small as hell, and the spread barely grazed the bun.

Maybe it's the wannabe-Texan in me, but I really hate build a burger places because it puts the job of the chef (to create unique and inspired cuisine) on the shoulders of the consumer. I like choice, but there was way too much. And when basic condiments have a charge on them, I cannot help but perceive that the objective of this establishment is the almighty paper, not serving good food (which eventually leads to earning more paper than if you put paper first like pretty much every restaurant in calgary). So there's my bias. 

Regardless, this place is very calgary: a very big \"whatever\"."}
{"text":"Alright if you're looking for a clubbing experience on a Friday night over a cheeseburger then Loungeburger is for you. Went to LB on a Friday night so we could use our Groupon. We came around 10 pm because the website mentioned that the kitchen closes at midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. Cool. No problem; But when we got there the dining room was closing so we had to go the lounge which was playing LOUD live DJ music. We would have left and come another day but we were starving. The boyfriend asked if they could keep the music at a reasonable volume but they appologized and said that they feature DJs on Fridays and Saturdays and couldn't do anything about it. We put up with it. 

I ate the Ahai Tuna Salad with ginger wasabi dressing and my boyfriend had the Cheese Burger with a side of ceasar salad. The food was pretty good. Nothing to write home about. If the music wasn't overwhelming, I might have added another star to the experience. It was enough for us not to return. 

My advise to you, if you enjoy clubbing and live DJ electronica while enjoying a burger and having a few drinks, this is the place for you. If not, I'd recommend some place quieter like Tommy Burger."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch after a team meeting. Not feeling too hungry, a coworker and I split the deep fried pickles and potchos (I'm a sucker for lattice fries!)

Since we went at an off time, it was quite dead so I couldn't really oogle food at the surrounding tables to scope out what I'd get next time if I ever came back.

The food was decent, nothing to rant or rave about really."}
{"text":"called to get a pick up order was told its to busy to order food that I needed to come in and order it for take out?. doesn't that deceive the point of take out?. and is that not the exact same thing I asked for in the beginning except for me not sitting around for 30min??. after All this bullshit I arrived at lounge burger and ordered food and sat around for 20min and wasn't asked if I wanted a drink or anything. burger didn't come with everything I had asked for got home and noticed this. NOT HAPPY AND ID SUGGEST NOT GOING TO THIS PLACE OR RECOMMENDING IT TO ANYONE"}
{"text":"While I absolutely love the food, I really wish they would rethink their reservation system on game nights. Either make it entirely first come first served (no reservations) or limit the length of time a reservation is held for. It can't be good business sense to hold a table more than 1/2 an hour past the reservation time when there is a lineup of people waiting to spend their money."}
{"text":"Arrived at this place after being unable to figure out a place to eat and remembered the last time eating here was pretty good.

Arrived at 2:13 according to the check and ordered approx 5 minutes later. Ordered popcorn shrimp, Potachos and a Veggie Burger.

Waited 40 minutes for our food and when it arrived the potscho had bacon on them, as a vegetarian it was something that did not come with bacon so we ordered it only to have bacon on it. We told the waitress and she took it back and in approx 5 minutes we had our dish back... Without bacon but you could tell that the bacon had bern picked off and some cheese put on with green onion and put back in the oven. The my came with a wierd dressing that did not match with the food, sour crew and guac would have been a better pairing. 

The popcorn shrimp was an odd Asian flavour. Not pleasing at all.

The veggie burger was ok. Have had better at other places.

To top it off someone or something was messing with the music which caused the volume in the place to rise sharply then dead silence.

Only baseball on the TV which is fine but all tv's come on. There was only 6 couples in the joint.

The waitress was not personable until we were paying the $40+tip check.

Just lost us as a customer for poor attitude, poor food handling by just removing the bacon. You don't think we wouldn't notice the hot soft no longer crispy waffle potachos."}
{"text":"When I arrived I was seated promptly and the server was efficient and pleasant.Her very good level of service continued throughout the evening.My food arrived, a Kahuna Burger with a side Caesar salad.The burger was excellent,the salad was mediocre.For dessert I had the cheesecake which was fine,but nothing outstanding. A small piece of cake for $9.00. So folks, here's the total. One burger with a side salad, a beer, a cheesecake and decaf coffee for $38.50 !
 
What bothered me most about LoungeBurger was not just how overpriced it is (for WHAT it is), but just before I was seated the server was cleaning the table beside me and using a spray bottle (with cleaning fluid in it I guess). At the end of my meal I looked over and saw the bartender openly spraying Windex on the bar counter, right across from 3 booths with couples in each booth. Really? Did she not think at all about the people sitting right across inhaling the smell? I could smell it and I was 4 or 5 booths away from there.It is stupid things like this that could ruin an experience anywhere.All they have to do is put some solution into a cloth and wipe. Or,better yet,wait until the customers have left, then spray. The place was 75-80% empty (maybe that is a sign) when I was there,they did not need to spray anything while customers were there.Its not like they needed the counter space! 

 LoungeBurger is located inside a beautiful newer building.What a shame to lower themselves to putting tv screens all over the place (including the booths), and on top of that,they play the same game on every screen! Gee,how original.
 
I will not buy anymore special vouchers for any restaurant.They are a sign usually,that the place needs to do something to improve their business before they go broke. What was obvious to me was that LoungeBurger looks like it is trying to cash on the location, being across from the Stampede Grounds and the Calgary Flames games.Unfortunately,these days,they have neither one of those to count on."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing crazy, only you're paying 13 - 15.00 for a burger. I had the slider trio (3 mini burgers) thought they would be different in taste as our server mentioned that way you could try more flavors, by having the 3 small burgers... it was good, but not really point to get it if it's the same. 

May go back there, but not in a rush to do it..."}
{"text":"Lounge Burger is sliding down a slippery slope... I've been coming here since it opened. Prior to this visit, Lounge Burger consistently served fresh burgers, great drinks and hand cut fries. The servers were friendly and energetic. This Sunday visit was my first in about a year.

The first thing I noticed was it looked \"worn\". The granite bar had fingerprints and hadn't been cleaned. The booth fabric was stained and the whole place just felt dirty. We were served our drinks quickly but then the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes for no reason. When signaling two other employees we were ignored. Finally the waitress returned to take the order.

When I picked up the menu, the prices had close to doubled. The menu was cut to only a few items which was fine with me, as I was craving a burger. I ordered the classic burger with sweet potato fries which was $20. I usually order the bison burger but wasn't in the mood to spend the new price of over $30 for a quick lunch. Much to my dismay, the burger is no longer fresh. They use a perfectly round frozen patty that is soaking in grease. (See posted picture) This is the type of frozen burger you purchase in the large plastic bag in the \"Family Size\" frozen section with the paper separating the frozen patties. Or if you remember the burgers in your school cafeteria line, this is what they're now serving. The meat itself couldn't have cost more than $0.25 a patty.

Honestly, I don't mind paying for good food, but Lounge Burger is only a few frozen patties away from driving itself out of business. Its a sad fall for what used to be a great local burger place."}
{"text":"Upscale burger / lounge joint near the Saddledome.  This new restaurant is also in a new building, so the decor is clean and modern.  There are around 12 choices of meat for the burger \"patty\" including various beefs, seared ahi tuna, salmon, chicken, lamb, etc.  There is also a veggie burger and a portobello mushroom burger (and a few salad choices) for any vegetarians.  There are a lot of toppings and sauces like tzatziki, cilantro peanut, blue cheese, chipotle, curry ketchup... the list goes on.  The sauces are tasty.  You can build your own burger or choose from one of their pre-built ones.  I had a salmon burger on a whole wheat bun, topped with a remoulade sauce and tomatoes.  Most burgers were reasonably priced ($10-$15), but you can also get some expensive meats or go all-out with their $40 kobe beef burger topped with prosciutto wrapped lobster and truffle hollandaise sauce.  My only complaint:  The service was quite slow, and the place was packed.  If you want quick service or less noise, be sure to choose a night when the Flames or Hitmen aren't playing!

Update:  Since opening, this place has gone downhill.  They charge extra for nearly everything (Want a different bun?  sauce? That'll cost you!)  The service is always slow - even when they aren't busy.  The \"pints\" aren't actually the size of a standard pint (I know we don't have laws on this in Canada, but it bothers me anyway).  That being said, if you are looking for food & drinks within a few blocks of the Saddledome, this will be one of the few options on your list.  So, if you need something in the immediate area, it will suffice."}
{"text":"So I had not been back in almost a year but we recently had a work function so didn't have much of a choice.  We went on a Thursday night with a group of approximately 30 people.  We were all seated in the same vicinity but given the size were at a bunch of different table, not a big deal.  Drinks came out relatively fast although sometimes the glass sat empty (again will give leway given the size of the group).  The server did a great job taking drink, appy and dinner orders and everything came out relatively fast.  I felt kind of bad for her as the place wasn't very busy and she only seemed to get help to bring dinner orders out.  Nevertheless she did well. The appys were really good, we ordered Cheese toast, dry ribs, fried pickes and crispy thai bites.  Everyting tasted very good.  I then ordered my own burger (kobe beef) which some additions and the burger was really so-so.  I ave had way better burger at other places and given the price and hit and miss service I probably wouldn't go back unless it was another function."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. My $21.95 bison burger was not cooked, and actually still frozen in the middle. For a place that claims to \"please the burger connoisseur,\" they are sadly mistaken. Our server did the best she could do given the poor quality of food. How is this place still open?!? So so disappointed! Steer clear of this place"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the place was fairly empty so the service was lightning fast. I had the bison burger with waffle fries and I loved them both. The burger was one of the bigger burgers I have eaten in Calgary and was very delicious as were the fries. I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"So came here expecting a freshly made burger instead what came out looked like a frozen burger cooked was really disappointed this supposing to be one of the top burger places in Calgary. I can go to ikea and have a better burger was so so disappointed. The only reason it got 2 stars was because the service was good."}
{"text":"Been to LB several times now. All in all good overall experiences. Burgers are really tasty, I recommend just building your own every time.

Their appetizers really shine though. Try the meatballs, dumplings, or anything else that sounds good (it will be)."}
{"text":"My bf and I went there to watch a hockey game and to try out their burgers since we have heard good things about them......sorry to say, it was quite a disappointment.  

I think their burgers are overrated.  I didn't think their burgers are any different than...i don't know....any pub burgers.  We also tried one of their appetizers - Crispy and Curly Calamari, yup NOT crispy at all but definitely curly.  It was probably one of the smallest appetizers I have had..which is fine IF it tastes good...but it didn't.  It was kinda soggy and bland.

Also tried their dessert - Creme Brulee.  Meh, I've had better.  

Service was ...... ok.  The waiter for our table was nice.  But there are couple of waitresses were a little bit too snobby for my taste.  

The restaurant layout is quite \"weird\" I found...not sure if it's like that every saturdays but they split into two sections (with the bar right in the middle).  One side is kind of like a clubbing area (where people drink and dance) and the other side has tables and serve dinner.  It gets louder and a little rowdier later at night.  And OMG....the ladies bathroom is DISGUSTING!  I thought this restaurant is quite new!!! 

Oh and the bar is actually located right outside of the bathrooms.....it takes about 5 min to try to get by people in order to go back to my table.  Since a lot of them would just stand near the bar, asking/waiting for drinks, talking etc......it was not very pleasant.  And i guess it was just a bad night for me, as I was trying to get by people, the waitress behind me pushed me to move faster and almost crashed into people.

I do want to try their Ahi Tuna Burger tho but I am afraid to go back there.  Maybe next time I will try takeouts............"}
{"text":"Some may be put out that Loungeburger's veggie burger is a Portobello Mushroom cap, but I'm not. In fact, I'm thrilled. Especially when so many veggie burgers in town are just reheated Money's Gardenburger patties from Costco, which are not vegan at all. 

--- Pro tip: If a restaurant describes their veggie burger as a \"brown rice and mushroom patty,\" it's a Money's Gardenburger. Fine if you're an ovo-lacto vegetarian, not fine if you're vegan or have dairy and/or egg allergies. ---

Arrived here with 2/3 of the YYC Burger Week crew after sloshing about Beerfest, so they could kick off the start of their Tour De Fatasserie® with Loungeburger's entry: AAA beef, caramelized onions, an onion ring, cheese and sauce.

Service was friendly, and non-judgmental of two ladies that were heavily marinated in fermented drink. I wish she would have come back more often or stuck around for more than a nano-second after asking us how everything was, because I wanted to ask for hot sauce or a glass of water. Although, according to other reviews, I would've been charged for that... so, major side-eye.

All in all, solid 3. I probably wouldn't come back on my own, but I wouldn't hesitate if I was invited."}
{"text":"Having lived in the area a year ago, I was all about their Bison Burger. So when my old neighbor called me to go for a bite at LB, I was in. When we walked in it was shortly after work hours, there was hardly anyone in the place. Having thought it odd we sat down at the bar. Ordering a pint the Waitress/Bartender brought me the wrong pint. When I asked her she said that the keg was out and someone was changing it.
Glad she took the initiative. For my second pint, the keg was still not changed and she seemed like it did not matter.
As for our food, the wings were over cooked, but to the credit the burger was good.
With four surrounding residential towers and two office towers, LB should take note that it may not just be the new years hibernation that is stiffling the business."}
{"text":"I had a living Social coupon and I actually had troubles finding someone to go with me to use it. It was about to expire so I went by myself needing to spend $40. (I ended up being $1.25 over plus $6.50 tip)

First I had to park on the street - which during a weekday around 2pm was $4 for an hour and I used all the time maybe a couple minutes over. I asked the hostess /waitress/bartender (one person) and street or pay lot parking is all there is.

I went inside and was shown to a booth the place was quiet, with maybe 5 tables total - but for a working day Monday afternoon, to be expected I think. Lots of TV's, even a small one at my booth. Bar/pub atmosphere.

I decided to build my own Vodka Caesar - about the only unique thing I saw on the menu - and with help from my very friendly waitress (she suggested a build) - Bacon Vodka, chipotle spice - I just let her run with it and it was good.

I then ordered some chicken wings as an appetizer and the Black & Blue (beef/blue cheese) burger and I added Bacon) with Onion rings for my side. Burgers are ala cart - so my bacon ($2) and Rings ($5) made my burger a $20 burger.  I stuck with beef as I have had other meat burgers before - and although usually decent often they can be dry... imho Beef and burgers work together in perfect harmony, there is no better substitute... I was also able to order a Whole wheat bun - making me happy

To start the wings were over cooked, to the point that some were like chicken sawdust. Not good - to be fair the waitress came and asked how they were and I said \"There ok\" and left it at that because I was thinking in my head how the heck would I a) use up $40 dollars if she took them off and b) eat any more food than I had already order if she replaced them. They were not terrible - just some were really over cooked and they lacked sauce in general - better than raw... but not being able to cook chicken wings on a slow Monday afternoon... I don't get how that's hard for a pub cook. In fact it's not. Dry sawdust like wings are a result of shortcuts being used in the kitchen... something I get and expect on a 10 cent wing night, but when its $13 for a pound (maybe 10 wings on the generous side) They should be done from scratch and cooked right. I paid $13.00 not $1.30

There was a really long delay between me finishing my wings and my burger arriving. I'd guess 20 minutes - By the time I started to wonder what was taking so long it was too late to time it. Why short cut the wings cooking time if you have to properly grill a thick burger. I don't mind waiting for properly cooked food... but the odd juxtaposition of standards was sloppy.

Rings were just okay. The batter had an odd flavor - not bad but it was made in house I think and although kind of bland tasting also had an odd hint of a flavor I could not place. So bland with a slight weird taste = I used ketchup...  Also - while I believe they are \"home\" made rings - don't expect a lot for a $5 add on, I think there were 6-7 rings. 

Finally the burger itself. The $2 bacon add on turned out to be a $1 a strip. A little cheapo if you ask me.  At least cut them in half and then completely cover my burger - the \"X\" pattern just meant long pieces of bacon sticking out on 4 sides and not getting bacon flavor with every bite... it made me shake my head. Looking beyond that the burger was yummy, just as good as any I have had when eating out. It was cooked right, The custom meat blend they used was tasty, but didn't seem to have any seasoning or flavor in it beyond the beef. So I was not blown away. Don't get me wrong it was good. But I make a fantastic burger patty at home, - I season my meat with chives/onions and spices as I see fit (depends on mood but anything from dill, curry, garlic powder, cayenne or even mustard powders.) I do a damn good burger at home and even though I only use some of those flavors at one time it gives it a nice kick and a blast of taste to the otherwise fairly bland taste of cooked ground beef. Other restaurant don't do that either and their burgers come close if not tie a loungeburger burger... So I'm just not sure why I would come back here spend $4.00 on parking (at least) and $7+ for a la cart items (a burger that doesn't at least come with fries... really?) ... I just didn't see what was so special.

I think the name hurts them. If you're going to name your Restaurant /bar \"*anythinghere*burger\".  You're burgers better be incredible. Anything less is underwhelming and focal point to talk about . If this was a review of a sports bar... Maybe more stars? (wings & rings still sucked)

For me everything around the burger was subpar and although it was a good burger. It was not special. Just a good solid restaurant burger. Same as the kind you can get in many places.

The stars say it all - \"Meh.\" If your going to base you business on one menu item you'd better have a hell of a plan for it and these guys went with above average. Not smart."}
{"text":"Ok......so its not just me. Why the hell do they need an executive chef is what confuses me??!

This is it in a nutshell exact....(M&M frozen meat patty).

Kind of deceiving seeing as it is in such prime real estate and oh wait....they have an executive chef. I guess that makes me Ina Garten.

I only eat beef as a rare occasion and so what a let down. Let me save your $20/burger for you."}
{"text":"Oh Loungeburger... what happened?

I remember when this place opened. I would even wager that it was one of the first to hop on the gourmet burger train (of course, Calgary staples such as Boogie's are excluded here as I am referring to the recent trend).  In the days of old, you could configure a burger with a startlingly broad amount of options.  The staff was enthusiastic, the atmosphere buzzing. 

Now? Not sure if there was a change in management, but things are different. The menu has become very limited compared to its former glory. Customization options have decreased to a few typical items. Service was incredibly slow despite the place being relatively dead. The girls at our table had to stop the server as she walked away, asking if they could order drinks. \"Uh... I guess so\".  My jaw dropped. Here we are offering to waste money on overpriced drinks that will help inflate your tip.. and.. I guess so? 

The rest of the night rolled along the same way. It was around 9:30p at that point, but we asked if we could order food. She \"supposed\" she could check with the kitchen. So at this point, I'm already feeling bad for ordering food and wondering if that's even appropriate. We went ahead anyway and ordered. The burger was.. pretty bad. What was once a beautifully cooked juicy patty was now greasy, dry, and lacking any colour. The toppings tasted somewhat stale, and the entire thing was soggy. The brioche bun was starchy and dry. The worst part is that it wasn't cheap.

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine and I decided to finally check this place out, I was getting sick of Taste, and found out they do a GF bun, so figured why not. 

It wasn't busy, which was nice, lots of TVs with all kinds of sports on, which was nice. We both ordered the bison burger, and she made sure mine was GF. I went with the coleslaw and my friend had the onion rings. 

The burger was delicious!!! So good and huge, I couldn't even finish mine. The service was good, our server came around just enough, made sure we were good. And it wasn't too loud, so you could still have a conversation. 

My only complaint is the price. For our burgers, two sides and two drinks it was $70, which is a little steep for lunch. Now the portions were huge, so I supposed it justifies, but I'd rather smaller portion that I can actually eat. 

Knowing that it is good, I will be back."}
{"text":"i have had 2 experiences here, one was takeaway and the other dine in. 
Both times I ordered the veggie burger, and have to say it was one of the worst I have ever had. It quite literally fell apart. It was tasty enough, but very hard to wrangle. 
When dining in, our server was pleasant. The decor was chic and cool. They are in quite an odd location though. One good thing is the big parking lot across the way.
Perhaps there are better burgers to be had. My experience was just so so  as food quality was consistently poor. 
2 stars for me."}
{"text":"I went to loungeburger to watch a Flames game recently. This was the first time I'd been there (besides visiting their tent twice during Stampede, which was a blast, but doesn't count) I've heard good things, but this experience was sub-par.

We sat on the lounge side. Our server took a while to greet us even though it was dead. When I ordered a cocktail off the drink menu, our server had to check with the bartender first to see that he would make it, as they apparently often decline cocktail orders \"during Flames games.\" We were then handed a food menu, which seemed a little lackluster. When we enquired if there was a full menu on the dining side, we were told \"not during Flames games.\" 

On a positive note, the lounge itself is nice; it has that \"new\" shine to it. A bonus is the \"private\" TVs in some of the booths as well as the several strategically-placed big screens. The food is pretty good for the most part. They obviously specialize in burgers, reminds me of the \"Do one thing really well\" motto, which works.

My biggest complaint about our service is we sat around and watched the remainder of the game after we paid our bill - but with empty water glasses in front of us. A definite pet peeve of mine is when servers do the bare minimum and still expect an amazing tip. I know water is free, but I'm still a guest and one who already gave an amazing tip despite the disappointments throughout the night. Would it be asking so much to get a refill?

All this being said, I'm not usually one to judge an entire venue on one experience, or on one server for that matter. I'm sure I will go back and give it another shot sometime... Just not during Flames games."}
{"text":"Don't go on a night when they are playing \"live DJ Music\" it is so loud I thought I was at a club.... I could not hear my date across the table; was shouting the whole time. If your into techno maybe you will like this place? I don't really know....

Food was ok but nothing really special and the service very slow. portons are small and overall just disapointing.

I ordered the blue cheese burger only to wonder after the first 4 bites if there even was cheese on it. After looking there was a few small little crumbles with an overcooked pice of meat.

if you want a burger done right go to Tommy Burger (owned by the Metropolitan Grill) they do it right, and the prices and atmosphere is good. Another place Is suggest is The District. although it is not just a burger place there burgers are fantastic."}
{"text":"If you want the TL;DR version of my review, it's this: the food is phenominal, but I have honest to god NEVER had worse service at a restaurant before. 

Our group of 4 (2 couples) met there to have dinner before heading to a concert. I'm certain they scored this location at least partially because of the proximity to the saddeldome.. but with that you would think they would have some forethought on game or concert days to be on top of their own game. They were not. 
We arrived an hour and a half before our ticket time and I can't emphasize enough how we were *not* in a rush at that point. We really didn't care about the opening acts, so in theory, we could have had even 2 - 2 1/2 hours to eat. The other couple showed up about ten minutes before we got there and were rather reluctantly given a table in the dining section. Mind you, there was no one else seated in this section at the table, but almost all the table tops had 'reserved' signs on them. We got there, sat down and started looking through our menus. Other couple decided on their app already and my partner and I were still working on our drink orders when our server initially came up - so we gave our orders for those and she said she would come back for the rest momentarily. 
Cue 20 minutes going by. 
Mine and the other couple's drink orders come out, apps come out. My partner's drink is mia. We mention that and our server says, \"oh, it's on its way\" and then leaves. We don't see her again for another 15 minutes.
Finish our apps, are starting to be concerned that my partner doesn't have his drink yet. We flag our server down when we see her pass by, and she again says the drink is on its way. We order our meals and another round of drinks while we have her. 
A few minutes pass and then partner's drink shows up. Another 5 or so minutes pass and partner's MEAL shows up. Just his. Other drinks show up. Empty plates and glasses are still on the table from the beginning of the meal. Partner begins to eat as we don't want his food to be cold by the time ours decides to get there.
We start to notice the same bewildered look on other tables' faces as their meals and drinks either come out in bits and pieces, or get forgot about altogether. The dining side of the restaurant is *not* full at this point and our server alone has maybe 4-5 tables.
By this point, we're annoyed but not upset. We wait till we see our server and point out that we are again waiting on some drinks, 3 orders of food and that my partner has literally almost finished his meal while the rest of us don't even have ours. She says little more than \"oh.. sorry\" and walks away. We don't get an explanation, just 'oh'. She still doesn't clear off the table, either. 
At this point, we notice the manager walking around and call him over to explain how our night has gone so far. He is apologetic, but blames the kitchen staff. He says for our trouble he will comp our drinks. We decide to cut our losses then and there and give him our final drink order and ask him to please have our bill sent over.
Within 2 minutes the other 3 of us receive our food. Hmm.. kitchen problem, eh? No joke, it's then still another 15 minutes until we get our drinks and bill. (The table across from us had almost the exact same dining experience as we did with plates coming out before others and drink orders not being filled for half an hour)

I will say this. The food made up for most of the shitty service in the moment. We ate and ate happily, but once we left, we were all just in disbelief with how unbelievably bad our service had been. I've waited before, but I've also almost always had staff who seemed to understand that the service was slow or crap and tried to make up for it. Our server either didn't get that it was ridiculous or simply had her head in another place. But the manager also didn't do much to make us believe that if we went here again the same thing wouldn't happen.
So we won't be going. And I hope you are prepared if and when you do go that you may have to wait and be exasperated to the point where your meal becomes a bad joke."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in Calgary. They have a full page of signature Loungeburgers and a full list of toppings to make your own Frankenstein-style creation. I was there for lunch on Friday and I had the lamb burger with taziki & feta cheese. It was brilliant.

One day I'll have to try the \"$40 Lounger\". It's not quite as expensive as the $5000 burger at Mandalay Bay in Vegas, but by Calgary standards it's pretty pricey for a burger (and for good reason), check the description below:

\"kobe wagyu topped with a prosciutto wrapped lobster, butter lettuce, chives and a truffle hollandaise sauce on a pretzel bun.\" Boom."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Loungeburger for some time, so went for dinner after Beerfest last night. What the heck has happened to this place?!? They have changed their menu - the food is still decent, but overpriced considering you have to order your sides separately (which I don't believe you had to do before). They've also removed some of my previous faves, like the turkey burger and cherry tomato salad. 

The service was also underwhelming...I think 3 different people helped us. The person who I think was our waitress would frequently disappear. When our food was delivered by another server, we weren't asked if we needed anything else, and had to flag someone down to even get cutlery and napkins. It was not busy for a Friday night, and overall the experience was disappointing. 

The only good thing...2 playoff games and our booth had its own TV."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!  I recommend the lamb burger, and the scenery is pretty nice too!

Fairly decent price too, for the amount of food you get.  Service is a tad slow, but they were busy.  (Excuses, excuses)"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Loungeburger before the game the other night despite the tepid reviews of late.   I was pleasantly surprised.  My bacon cheeseburger was delicious; the bun was very fresh.  The waffle fries were so good we ordered a second batch.  The wine list was adequate and the service was outstanding despite the fact that it was a very busy pregame evening.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We should have known when we walked in at 7:30 on a Saturday night and there was only one other table (on the lounge side, restaurant side was closed, no one there).  I had the bison burger with a side of onion rings and my husband had the salmon burger and salad.  The only thing that was decent was the onion rings.  My burger was really weird tasting maybe it's because there was no taste?  First it was broiled or something but not flame grilled that's for sure.  The sautéed mushrooms were rubbery and again an odd taste.  My husbands'a salmon burger was really off, bad tasting probably because the fish wasn't fresh.  I'm giving it one star because of the onion rings.  The service wasn't great either.  You know the feeling you get when you leave a restaurant and felt disappointed and unsatisfied??  That's how we felt, not to mention ripped off.  Will not be back for sure.  There was nothing gourmet about Loungeburger."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Location: The street is not fully developed yet but there are enough high priced condos to keep this place going. Close to the Dome for a before or after concert delight. Score one for the location - kind of. Decor: New, modern, interesting lines, lots of screens, nice lighting, comfortable seating. Score two. Service: Prompt, courteous, mostly accurate, Earl-type hiring practices (must be female, thin, beautiful and be willing to wear the requiste ultra short and tight killer black dress). Score 2.75 depending on your POV. Food: Tasty soup, delicious burgers. Nothing overly generous. If you are a large hungry gentleman, this is definitely not the place for you. Score 3.5. So there you have it. A 3.5 out of 5. Go and have some fun. And there is better pretty much in every quadrant of the city."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with gf and our parents Mar 23rd.  Table was ready early, which was a plus.

Food is great.  Burgers tasty, good toppings, and good choices of sides (3+kinds of fries, onion rings, salad)

Servers, not the best.  Asked for an extra napkin - it never came.  Also, slow to refill drinks, including water, which left some people at our table thirsty.

Decent food, gets busy, small place - but I would go back for the pretzel buns!  A must.

Ask about drink specials - menu shows 'daily specials' - but waiter mentioned something about happy hour, and that it was only until 6?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night before a concert and right when you walk in i was amazed with the ambiance of the restaurant. Had a great atmosphere and a great menu. I ordered the KOBE burger and it was absolulty delicious. 4 Stars only because it was a little on the pricey side ($21 for Kobe burger) which may be normal in canada but Cheesecake factory has one for $14."}
{"text":"Curious, I dropped by for lunch because it's near where I work. I ordered the Kobe Beef burger, found it juicy and not over-seasoned, but the only side it came with was a large pickle -- sweet potato fries were $5 extra. The desserts were pricey, so I passed. Service was friendly and prompt, which is good because the place was not terribly busy on a Thursday at noon."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner to use our Social Living coupon. We were greeted promptly and our server was with us in short order. We ordered the Thai Chicken bites and Salt and Pepper wings for starters - they however got left in the kitchen for too long and had to be redone. Although we ended up having a lengthy wait for the appys they were very tasty and both the manager and server were very apologetic. The husband opted for the basic burger and I had the veggie burger - both were well received. Despite the initial hiccups the staff's response changed what could have been an off-putting experience to a very pleasurable one, we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Today I had the pleasure of having lunch with my employer.  LB is quite close to our work place and we had heard tons of good things from our customers. 

It seemed like there was a Flames game tonight, because the other customers and LB staff were donning their Flames Jerseys. LB is conveniently by the Saddle dome so I can understand it attracting the sporting crowd.

When we arrived, we were greeted right away and had the option of either choosing to sit in the lounge or the burger. Just kidding! The other option was the restaurant, which we ended up choosing. It looks like LB attracts a diverse clientele too, from sports enthusiasts, and families to the construction worker.

For all y'all vegetarians who decide to step foot in here, you will be comforted to know that there is a veggie burger for you! Every burger has an option of fries, Cesar salad, or a soup and because all the fries are freshly made in the restaurant; LB will customize what flavour or style you want.  I personally like the sweet potato fries which are served with the dip. 

I choose the classic beef burger which is a nice Grade A Burger and my boss had the Smokey Chicken, and man were both burgers ever Juicy! 

Price ranges is great too, $11 for the veggie burger, $12 for mine and it can go up to the granddaddy of all burgers at $40.  We were so extremely stuffed that we didn't even get a chance to try the dessert burger which I will try at a future date.

LB serves it up with a huge variety of burger patty choices, pleasant atmosphere and economic pricing."}
{"text":"I was there for a birthday party and was so disappointed. The waitress brought drinks and disappeared. We had to track down the bartender, who then found another waitress to take our order.

When the food arrived, my signature burger wasn't cooked according to the description. The original waitress came back, and was less than impressed to fix my burger, refill the drinks at the table or take the complaint that the basil aoli tasted like tatziki sauce.  

The burger was fixed somewhat. Cheese was fixed (was supposed to be aged cheddar but I got processed), but there was still lettuce on it (I had asked for lettuce and tomato removed). The aoli was replaced which was appreciated.

We weren't given the option to order dessert for the birthday boy. The waitress brought the bill. We had to order dessert afterwards and ask for additional refills on the drinks.

The event that was supposed to be so much fun was ruined by the terrible service. The dinner lasted much longer than it should have as we spent so much time waiting. When I called to make the reservation I was told that the restaurant was dead. So was the service.

If you are going to park, make sure you bring a credit card. It's $4.00 an hour. There is free parking after six about a block away."}
{"text":"Burgers were good, but to be honest you're paying for the decor and the servers, not for the burgers.  I can see how this place would be attractive to the stampede / business lunch crowd (read: cute servers in short skirts), but if you're looking for a great tasting burger you'll get it much cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"To say this place is at most a tone star is being generous.
I visited on occasion in the past, when they still had that delicious banana split for dessert, and that was ok. Service was still lacking back then and the food took extremely long.

I don't know when LB decided to take a nose dive into disaster town and become even worse.

The burgers are 'ok.' So I thought I would try something else this time, since the burgers aren't a hit, I'll try some deep fried pickles and chicken waffles.
Deep fried pickles were oily, hard, and bland. Batter. Everywhere.
Chicken & waffles? Lies. It was chicken and biscotti. The precut pieces of waffle were rock hard. Completely inedible. Chicken was drenched in salty teriyaki sauce. Don't expect the traditional chicken and waffles. 

Waitress explained that the head chef was off that day, and half heartily apologized. Then billed us the full amount, without even clearing the full plate of inedible food. 
Thank you. I really needed to be reminded of the food I didn't eat, and now I am paying for.

Final note, they use Bell or something and do not broadcast most MLB games.

Salmon burger is ok, but again too much bread!

Waffle fries are good.
everything is served a la carte
This would not be my first choice for burgers"}
{"text":"If I had the choice of never having a burger again or never being able to have kids, it would be a serious dilemma. If your children act up on you, you can't just eat them. Score 1 for burgers.

Needless to say, there are few things that get me more excited than the prospect of trying out a new burger-centric restaurant. I was like a schoolboy on Christmas. I'm not sure that's the analogy but I'm sticking to it. Expectations were high; if you've got \"burger\" in the name of your restaurant, your burgers had damn well better deliver.

I'm sorry to say, but Loungeburger's didn't. It was all smoke and noise, signifying nothing.

So here's an open letter written with love and care to the management at Loungeburger. Here's how you could have wowed me:


1. Y U NO SPECIALS!?

I came here on a Thursday night - not exactly prime time for most restaurants. Usually restaurants recognize this by offering specials. Not Loungeburger. Upon being asked, my hostess said they didn't have any specials \"Because we just renovated. But we'll have specials on Monday again!\"

Uh, what? That's possibly the most convoluted explanation ever. You don't have specials because you just renovated? Are you trying to tell me you cant' give me 15% off a beer because you need my chump change to help you pay for the reno's you just did? Why can you do that on Monday, but not on Thursday? Will you have paid off your renovation debt using your undiscounted beer money by then? Do you have some sort of Italian mobster breathing down your neck who gave you a deadline for \"next Monday or else your kneecaps get it\"? 

Okay, I guess.

2. Y U SO STINGY!?

Okay, seriously - you want me to pay you to have dip with my yam fries? That's just greedy. I get that your rent is high and that you just renovated, but literally every other restaurant I've ever been to in my life brings out your yam fries with something other than ketchup. 

Ketchup does not go with yams unless you're some sort of 12 year old. Have a little class and bring your patrons something fancy sounding like \"aioli\". Ketchup and yams. Seriously. It's like you aren't even trying.

If I want to change my bun, I need to PAY you for that? A bun is a bun is a bun. If I don't put your whole wheat bun on my burger, it's going to go stale in your cabinets because NOBODY WANTS TO PAY YOU $2 TO CHANGE THEIR BUN. Make this complimentary instead of nickle and diming me. 

Every single additional topping also costs as well - which is fairly normal I guess, but it's tragic in a way because their standard line up of burgers come so boringly appointed that adding cheese to them seems more like a necessity than an option. 
There's your standard \"This burger is spicy!\" burger, and a \"This burger is our classic!\" burger, and then one or two other variations on a theme that were so unremarkable I didn't even find them compelling. 

Do yourselves a favor and take a page from Red Robin. They do burgers right.

The friend I was with ordered a grapefruit juice - only to receive an excessively watery grapefruit cocktail instead. COME ON GUYS. Grapefruit juice should be grapefruit juice. It's like $3.99 at WalMart. Sort it out.

On the plus side, you DO have waffle fries, so that won you back some major brownie points. Waffle fries are like crack cocaine. They're like the super fun cousin of normal fries that owns a motorcycle and lived in Guatamala for a year. I could have used more of them on my plate, but I was so overjoyed at the fact you sold them that I chose not to care.

3. Y U NO SPECIAL!?

There is pretty much nothing imaginative about the burgers here. I know this is going to sound like a massive slap in the face, but I've had more compelling burgers at Montana's. 

The burgers aren't especially big. The ingredients aren't especially unique. In fact, maybe the \"lounge\" part of the name is more telling, it's like someone whipped up the idea for these burgers while reclining in a chair and thinking \"Gaaaaah, that'll be good enough\" before trailing off to sleep and snoring obnoxiously.

Your burgers are good. Passable. But they're not special. They're not the kind of burger that makes me think you're a restaurant who specializes in burgers. 
Classic Jack's serves their burgers on a pretzel bun. What do you do? Nothing. NOTHING! You're a burger joint for heaven's sake, find a shtick! You don't even have a \"special sauce\"!?

The bottom line is that you can get burgers like this ANYWHERE without paying as much for them. 

On the whole, my trip to Loungeburger was exceptional. Exceptionally underwhelming, that is. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't exciting or memorable in any way.

3 stars - the experience was utterly average, but expectations were high."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Great place to watch some hockey.. The inferno burger is really got some heat on it."}
{"text":"Expensively terrible. This is probably the worse burger/bar I have ever been to. From beer barely cold to food barely warm, it plain sucks in every way - making you feel ripped off when you get the bill. My poutine was inedible, cold and featured lumpy gravy, cold fries and unmelted cheese curds.  Horrific. My burger, cold and of the quality you would find at an office picnic. 

Thanks for the warm beer and cold food. Upside is, I never have to submit myself to this place ever again."}
{"text":"The location is really nice!!.. And the service is great!!.. The onion rings and the burger were really good too!.. The meat was very tasty!.. It is a little heavy for lunch, but I liked it. I think I will go back there, to have a few drinks. because of the atmosphere!!.. Which is really nice!!.. And the prices are ok. It is not a cheap place, but you will have fun there!!"}
{"text":"stopped here for a quick lunch the other day and it was fantastic. Our service was great, burger and fries were fantastic, and my wife's salad was one of the best she has had, do to the dressing they used. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"SLOW SERVICE. Took over an hour to get our food. It was super tastey and the gluten free bun was amazing. However for the price I would have expected better service. The waitress was slow on beverages. It was a gong show. There were line ups for the woman's washrooms."}
{"text":"well...another attempt at bringing a unique concept to a bland and dull eating scene - great try.

But if you are going to create an upscale gourmet burger spot at least use fresh buns....

For the price I will go back to the good ol defaults of milestones, earls, moxies, cactus club, joey tomato and the other clones that disguise mediocre food with a designer setting...."}
{"text":"Sat for 35 minutes waiting to give dinner order... Then decided to leave and needed to find waitress to get the bill since the bartender couldn't pull it for us. Prices are expensive for the service you're getting."}
{"text":"After visiting Loungeburger a few times over the years, I think I have reached the final point of no return.

On our most recent visit, Jessica and I decided to make Loungeburger our Valentine dinner destination. Being little piggies, to us, no heart is as romantic as one clogged with bacon grease and trans fats. 

We were greeted warmly by our hostess, who was very friendly and inviting.
It seemed to be a promising opening to the meal.

Our server? Ehhhhhhhh ... not so friendly.
She was not grumpy, she was not rude, she merely seemed ... apathetic.
To be blunt, she just seemed to act like it didn't really matter if we were there or not.

We were offered no specials (it's VALENTINE'S DAY, c'mon!) and she barely said more than a couple words the few times she visited our table. It was like a less-friendly Stepford-Waitress.

So did the food save the day then? Hardly. Probably one of the least exciting Valentine's meals I can recall. We split both the Southwest Burger Pops and a Southwest Burger (which seems to change its style every time we have come in). The \"burger pops\" were like an undercooked corndogs which, instead of a \"dog\" contained little \"dogfood sized\" balls of burger meat. Not that appealing.
The burger, which we had asked to have cut and came out divided in two portions with a ratio of 20/80, was not that great. Definitely a step down from the last review I wrote for LB. 

The manager (who, like the hostess, was also quite friendly) helped us with our bill and granted us passage away from the bland den of apathy which we had been encaged for the early part of the evening.

The clincher of the night was that, as we were leaving, our server allowed us to see her looking at her tip on the receipt, showing that she was visibly unimpressed. This is despite the fact that we had tipped her over 20%.

Sorry, LB, but after a few visits, your food's mediocrity does not justify having to sit through service this bad. I wish you all the best."}
