{"text":"Go to Joe's Diner if you want good food because they've got it. Especially breakfast, which is excellent. Everything I've tried at this place (and their original 16th St. location) has been great. It's not cuisine, it's diner food and it's done right.

On the other hand, if you also value good service with your delicious chow, forget this place. On previous visits, the service has often been spotty, but it's easy to cut them some slack because the food's good and, after all, it's a diner. This morning I spent an hour and ten minutes sitting at Joe's counter, with only about 20 minutes devoted to actual eating. And I never got a second cup of coffee.

After the folks sitting next to me -- who came in after I did -- received their food, I flagged down another employee to inquire. Apparently, the server failed to give my order to the kitchen. Eventually, my breakfast bowl arrived, hot, delicious and, maybe even worth the wait. The server mumbled an apology for its lateness but had to be asked to provide me with utensils. 

About that coffee: The personable young woman who took my order was careful to explain that they were out of their special cups for decaf drinkers, so I should watch out in case someone tried to give me a refill with regular. Indeed, the VERY SAME SERVER came back to me later with regular coffee and tried to put it in my cup. As instructed, I stopped her and said I was drinking decaf. My cup remained empty and that was the last I saw of my server. 

And this was the last time I'll visit Joe's. Great eats just aren't worth the aggravation of being ignored."}
{"text":"ugly, poorly lit, microwave quality breakfast. id rather have a hungry man TV dinner. instant hershey squirts. so not worth it"}
{"text":"Service was good, the food came out quickly. The food was mediocre. The omlette came out with the look of scrambled eggs, the busciuts and  gravy had little to no flavor and my hash browns tasted like dead potatoes. 

This is a place to go maybe if you live really close or have some sort of emotional connection. I personally prefer other breakfast diners."}
{"text":"Came in on father's day and only had to wait about 10 minutes which I thought was pretty great for being so busy. The wait staff was working really hard and was jumping from table to table getting orders and drinks. It was pretty understandable that they took our order quickly and didn't spend too much time at our table. 

I ordered the chorizo omelette. It took about 20 minutes to get out to me. I think it could have come out a little faster since it was just lukewarm when it got to me. But it was still delicious! The eggs were fresh and the cheese was melty. I really like the potatoes it comes with as well. They know how to season a potato! 

So I would give this place a solid 9/10! They also serve RC cola which is super rad! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Joe knows pancakes!! Another great breakfast at Joe's. we have been there many times it is always solid food and friendly service."}
{"text":"This morning when deciding where my wife and I would enjoy breakfast we quickly agreed on Joe's, our expectations are alway's exceeded and today yet another exceptional breakfast."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time this morning and will never go back. The potatoes were to peppery and the bacon didn't even taste like bacon. My husband and I both got sick. The manager scolded one of his employees in front of customers. The only thing good were the pancakes."}
{"text":"Here are just a few reasons I love Joe's: 
1) It's locally owned, the owners are always here and super nice. 
2) They have the ideal diner coffee. You know? Like endless hot coffee that's really smooth and mellow? They even sell the coffee they use and I think I need to buy some next time. 
3) The corned beef hash. This is not something that jumps out at me on a menu, but it is excellent! Super crunchy and covered in three eggs. My favorite breakfast entree.
4) Chorizo gravy. This is Arizona. Eat some chorizo gravy. 
5) The pancakes. These are soooo buttery. I don't want to know how much butter is in there, just let me be happy.
Eat at Joe's!"}
{"text":"so DISAPPOINTED!!! I was visiting Phoenix from Seattle. I was excited to try Joe's Diner and support a local business. Unfortunately, our waitress got my order incorrect, so I re-ordered. The waitress suggested a subsitution with my original order, which sounded better so I accepted her suggestion. She then brought me the wrong food, AGAIN!! I didn't want to cause a scence, plus I was hungry and my friend had already finished eating.  I tried to eat the item she brought out but I couldn't because it has an ingredient she said it wouldn't come with. Needless to say, I asked for my orignal item. Finally, my \"breakfast burrito\" arrived... I was happy and about to start eating when  gentleman approached our table. He said to me, 
\"The next time you come to our resturant , can you please read the menu\".  I WAS SHOCKED!!! I couldn't believe one of the employees was saying this to me. I tired to explain there was a miscommunication between myself and the waitress. I was trying to be diplomatic about the situation and did not want to say she got my order wrong TWICE. This person continued to say (all smug and righteous) \"please read the menu the next time you come in because I've never had a customer return two meals before\". At that point, I asked the gentleman if he was the manager/owner and he said he was. I then told him, I've never experienced something like this before. I then told him I was shocked that we were having this conversation. I told him, his approach was making me feel like I did something wrong. He wasn't listening. He continued to smile and smuggly say \"all I ask is that you read the menu\" ... he then said \"this waitress has worked for me for 16 years and she has never made a mistake\". At that point the table next to us said, \"She got our order wrong too!\"... 

I really hope that Joe's Diner reads this and that gentleman thinks about how he approached the situation. 

I totally understand if an employer wants to stick up for thier employees (I applaude that) but when the \"manager/owner\" attacks the customer without understanding the situation, well, I had to post this review. 

I hope the Melrose area gets more restaurants in the area... I would love to support them. ... 

I'm so sad that this experience has left a nasty taste in my mouth for Joe's Diner.

One last note... not only did I receive the incorrect meal 3 times, I paid the bill for the food my friend ate and the final breakfast burrito. 

The waitress seemed scared of this gentleman. 
I don't know what was going on with her that morning, that caused the mistakes.
I left  her a $2 tip. 

I'm not a jerk.. I worked in restaurant business for many years. 
As those of us who have worked in that industry know when you are dealing with a \"bad\" customer AND we know when we are being \"bad' customers... no way was I being difficult. 

As I'm typing this review up, I'm still shocked with my experience at this diner :("}
{"text":"Oh Phoenix you did it again.  How can you screw up breakfast?  Cold eggs congealing on a plate?  Yes!  Raw, yet greasy potatoes that taste like chorizo? Yes!  Cold limp bacon? Yes!  Possibly the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life.  If you want a bad breakfast, I would recommend 5 and diner, for a truly horrific experience I would go Joe's Diner all the way."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is really good. I normally always get the breakfast burrito which comes with salsa and sour cream. It's a huge burrito so you will not leave hungry. I am only giving them 3 stars because the service is pretty bad. They always seem understaffed and nobody ever comes around to refill drinks. It takes 15 minutes on average to get your check. My husband and I went there one time and literally almost walked out. He never got the coffee he asked for and it was over 30 minutes for the check. Disappointing, as the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but I didn't and neither did my fiancé. 

Our food was not good. He ordered the corn beef hash. The corned beef had no flavor, the gravy tasted like flour, the biscuit was chewy. I ordered the number two. My eggs were cooked as I ordered them, and the pancakes were decent. But my bacon was another failure. I like it extra crispy. I ordered it that way too. It came out not crispy at all. After spending a few minutes attempting to flag down our waitress, she took it back. They cooked it some more, and it looked crispy. But it was still not crispy, which is a sign of bad/cheap bacon. Their sausage was also not good.  To make it worse, my food was either cold or lukewarm. 

We got prompt service - the drinks and food came quickly. But once that happened, we were ignored. Water glasses were empty and remained that way. Coffee not refilled. 

Also the staff seemed very inexperienced. We were sitting near the computer, and it was clear that the staff didn't know who was taking what table.  The servers also didn't know what table food was assigned to. 

Their prices were too high and we did not care for the food or service, so we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"So after reading some other reviews it looks like this place is total hit and miss. My experience was a total miss! 

My Financee and I went from Sunday brunch and was suprised at how dark it is inside. I guess when I think diner I think bright and clean. There was a waitress shuffling around that looked like she wanted to cut a bithc and one that was hussling for the whole crew. 

My financee got eggs benedict and while the sauce was good everything else was awful and I could only eat 3 bites of my chorizo omelet it was so greasy. 

I am tempted to say I will come back and try something else but frankly, they had their on chance to impress me (and I would have loved to add a cool new neighborhood joint to my list of faves) but they failed. I am out."}
{"text":"Well I haven't been here yet but if this is the place that plays Breakfast with the Beatles every Sunday morning then how could it be bad? Lol Rock on Joe see ya soon"}
{"text":"Had to check it out...  Let me say, Joe's pancakes were wonderful.  They took me back many years to my favorites.  They're not the thick fluffy pancakes my wife loves.  These are thin and they are simply wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great food! I love coming here for breakfast or an early lunch.

If your looking for good biscuits and gravy try the chorizo gravy."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good diner to eat at and this place hit the spot. Tried the biscuits 'n gravy everyone on yelp talked about. They did not disappoint. They where fluffy, warm and covered with chorizo gravy. Delicious! A great deal at $2.99!! They also have a special everyday. I went on a Sunday, so it was Eggs Benedict with home fries for $8.99. They where also great.  I placed my order and it was out and on my table in a flash. 

The only down side was the price of a large orange juice, $3.99! A bit steep for orange juice even if it was fresh squeezed. Not even sure it was. That won't stop me from going back. 

I left there full and satisfied. Over all it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Great local place to grub! Joe, his wife and staff are so personable and friendly, and the food is always good. If you want a great meal in a down home atmosphere, this is your place!   Added bonus - they're locavores!!!"}
{"text":"Well we decided to try this place since it's close to home..
The menu is your standard diner food but I was pleasantly surprised to see the Monte cristo sandwich (haven't had one in years)..
We were greeted and seated promptly by a friendly girl of about 17.
Our waitress arrived quickly and took our drink order then brought our drinks and took our food order.
The food arrived quickly and the waitress(Alina according to the receipt) brought our ranch dressing and strawberry jam we requested.
Unfortunately that was the last we saw of her. Another waitress asked if my daughter wanted more ice tea.
We ended up having to ask another waitress for our check.
Right before we stood up to leave someone finally asked if I'd like more coffee.

It was a little to late..
The food was okay but way over priced for what you get. I've attached the bill."}
{"text":"When we first walked in we didn't know whether to wait to be seated or seat ourselves, being our first time there, so we just stood there.  We waited long enough to consider leaving and going somewhere else.  There were under 10 people in the restaurant and no one was up front to greet us.  Finally one of the employee's told us, from the back of the restaurant, that we could just sit anywhere we wanted.  We were given a high chair that had to be wiped off first before we could even use it.  The server wasn't very friendly, my husband asked how she was doing and she said nothing then said, \"what would you like to drink?\"  We both ordered the number 2--- two bacon, two sausage, two eggs and either home fries or two pancakes - we got the pancakes. We got our eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese added.  The star of the breakfast was for sure the bacon (nice and crispy) and the pancakes.  The eggs and sausage were good, but they were nothing to write home about,  just the everyday eggs and sausage.  For the little one, I got a scrambled egg and some buttered white toast.  The toast was nice and thick, perfectly toasted.  The cost for all three of us to eat with a $5.00 tip was around $32.00, not too bad and the food was good and the portions were  big, especially the pancakes.

The inside was a bit drab.  Considering it was a diner, I expected a more upbeat 1950's vibe with bright colors and some music, it did not deliver and the bathrooms were kinda scary and had a bad odor to them. They have been at this location for about 6 months now and I would like to recommend a sign for when customers first come in that says \"seat yourself\" to avoid confusion on what to do, spruce things up a bit to look more like a diner and work on de-funking those bathrooms! Overall, it was just o.k. I don't know if it left enough of an impression for us to think of when we are looking for somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"We have gone to this cool local diner three times already and each time have had a very good experience. The staff, servers, hostess, and cooks are all very friendly. The food is excellent as well. We're definitley happy to have a place like this so close to home, for those Sat AM breakfasts. I recommend the meatloaf entree as well as the muffaletta sandwich.."}
{"text":"We have now given Joe's three chances, and three strikes and you're out. My wife and I ordered and the waitress was not very pleasant. I requested poached eggs on top of sourdough toast and received boiled eggs in a bowl and they were so done you could call them hard boiled. My wife ordered her eggs over easy and they to were cooked to death. We were afraid to send them back and get who knows what cooked into our order. Joe came out after our complaint and seemed very put out. We were not charged for the meal but were given a check for $8 for three drinks."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but......  So disappointing.  
 
Let's start with the decor; dark, mismatched and out dated.  I think they found booths somewhere and shoe horned them into the existing layout left behind by the Chinese restaurant that was the previous tenant.  Really this is as bad as it gets.  I get this is a diner but come on.  

The food kinda went with the service; uninviting.  The coffee (and I will drink 7-11 coffee) was just bad.  The potatoes were boiled and then warmed up on the flat top - no crispiness at all.  The chicken fried steak was doughy and under cooked.  Corned beef hash was out of a can and under cooked.   The biscuit was the single shinning moment of the day, first rate.

The service was uninspired but fine.

I didn't expect this place to supplant Matt's but there are a half dozen places within a 5 minute drive that will get my business instead of Joe's."}
{"text":"Joe's Diner is awesome from beginning to end! The wait staff is on top of their game and takes good care of their guests! This is only my second time here but after Joe introduced himself to the whole family and took the time to tell us about how everything, even the napkins are sourced here in Arizona! The idea of this place started around the campfire and you can still taste it in the food! Thank you Joe your place is definitely special!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my breakfast here was disappointing due to such terrible service. Our waitress forgot to put our food order in and we ended up waiting 45 min. for out food!! When we finally got it, it was very good though. We might try it again."}
{"text":"This place is aptly named.  A diner.  Simple, delicious no pretension here. No kale, certified organic cage free, gluten free, peanut free, fair trade nonsense here. Just a great cuppa Joe, served piping hot in a mug with cream.  Yes real cream. Friendly cheerful service.  We had the corned beef hash with eggs and an egg white omelette, both served with a side of toast.  They even have containers with fresh strawberry jam!  No plastic packets of jams from Sysco here!  If you are looking for a hearty breakfast, properly prepared and cheerfully served without an ounce of pretension, this is the place for you. And best of all this place is locally owned and operated."}
{"text":"I start my day at Joe's Diner! The rest of the day can be dashing here, zipping there and I never know where or when I get another chance to sit and eat. At least by starting at Joe's I get a chance to fuel up, check a half-dozen online newspapers on my ipad and not run outta steam until later in the day. Sometimes it's not so speedy, but I retired and I don't need speedy, I need tasty and Joe's Diner hits my spot and it takes all of two minutes to get there from mi casa. I will be back, daily!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a \"hole in the wall\" place that is simply delicious. If you drive down 7th Ave chances are you may miss it, but stop in for some good food. Big portions for good prices & the pancakes are amazing. Not to mention the service is wonderful & attentive. First time at this restaurant & I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not the most inviting space I've ever been to but the food hits the spot and made up for it.  This is a no frills attached diner type place for sure.  The food isn't going to be as fancy pants as you might find at some of the breakfast joints in the valley but that doesn't mean it isn't delicious! 

Joe (I think?) was making the rounds and gave me some additional hot sauce that wasn't on the table (cholula/tabasco). I thought it was too vinegary personally but I appreciated the gesture and being referred to as \"hot sauce guy\" was amusing.

Of course, I finally came here the week before I'm moving farther/further(seriously which is it?) away.....I suppose I can suck it up and make the 7 minute drive."}
{"text":"We have gone to Joes Diner many times for breakfast and lunch. This morning as usual the place was very busy and we had a short wait.  Regardless of how busy the food is always  great and the service very friendly and fast. Sunday morning they have an Eggs Benedict special that was great and reasonable price not to mention their fried potatoes. I have tried to figure out what they put in those potatoes to give them the flavor but still can't figure it out. Joe is always their making sure the guests are happy and satisfied. Joes Diner is the Best for Phoenix Breakfast or Lunch."}
{"text":"This place was really terrific! Went for the first time this morning with a friend & we both thought it was probably the best diner experience you can have in this town. 

The country potatoes were the best I've had in a restaurant--not greasy with great flavor. Good quality bacon and the coffee is really something to talk about too! 

They give you a choice of cheese for your omelet--I thought that was pretty uptown for a diner! :-) 

The owner says he tries to source as much locally as he can which is also nice---support your local Farm Bureau! Speaking of the owner(s) they were there working their tails off greeting, serving & generally chatting up everyone. Super nice people! I couldn't be more impressed with the food, service, or overall experience.

This is now on my very short list of favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"A wonderful little diner run by people I've known for years.  The sweetest most genuine people you will ever meet.  Joe knows good food and his restaurant speaks for itself :)  Try the biscuits and gravy or the #2!"}
{"text":"A great local find. The breakfast buritto is big and very tasty. The server was very friendly. A throwback to the old diners. It is worth a try."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Nothing fancy but the pancakes were delicious.  We saw a plate of biscuits and gravy walk by so we ordered some too.  So good, lots of sausage, great consistency and just the right amount of seasoning.  Can't wait to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love having a dinner breakfast and this restaurant serves up the whole atmosphere of a quality dinner.
  Super friendly staff.  My favorite thing was the biscuits.  Those things were so delicious I could have spent $20 just eating them. 
 The food was served hot and fast. All at a reasonable price.
My one negative is their menus isn't as quite as expansive as I was expecting.  
I do have to say the fact that my only complaint is their selection really speaks to the fact that I really enjoyed the restaurant.  I look forward to my next visit and highly recommend it to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"The best homemade breakfast in the neighborhood... I love coming here the wait is never long and the portions are huge.  I love their Country Fried steak and eggs and their chorizo gravy is amazing ...I always have great service every time we go. My husband gets the steak and eggs and the prices are great ."}
{"text":"The Hostess  seated me with out even saying hello. The service was cold the waitress didn't  deliver the food I think it was a cook the food was over priced and the chicken fried steak was not crispy it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Joe's Diner, I don't even know who you are anymore.

I visited Joe's Diner shortly after it opened, and I couldn't be more pleased: Fun, kitschy diner décor, tasty lunch-counter menu items, and friendly wait staff that buzzed constantly around the customers, all at very attractive prices. It's in my neighborhood, too, so I don't have to drive far (or at all, actually) to grab some chow and their excellent coffee.

I've returned several times since then, bringing out-of-town guests to show it off. The décor remains the same, the food tastes great - when it arrives warmer than room-temperature - but you can probably guess what has gone downhill. Yep, those friendly servers are still courteous, but boy, do they need lessons on serving customers.

It doesn't seem to matter if it's a jumping weekend, when Joe's Diner seems to double or triple its stiff, or a lazy Monday morning, when kitchen staff can outnumber customers. 

The servers seem downright oblivious to the most basic needs of the customers: Just this morning, I was seated at the counter - the one right in front of every staff member - and waited for a least 10 minutes before anyone dared make eye contact with me, much less bring me coffee. The waitress actually seemed surprised when, after she finally got around to asking if I wanted anything to drink, I started ordering my meal.

Waiting 10 minutes for a waitress might fall into \"first-world problems\" territory, and I might not have even noticed it if I was at a fine restaurant with an extensive menu, but geez, even Denny's will bring you coffee before you've had a chance to warm your seat.

To add insult to injury, I had to practically hunt down my waitress to get a coffee refill, and again, she acted like I'd asked for hollandaise sauce on oatmeal. It's a diner; coffee refills should be automatic. They should be refilling your coffee whether you want one or not.

Sadly, this wasn't an isolated incident. This type of lackadaisical service has been becoming more pronounced at Joe's the last few months.

The food is fine: chicken fried steak will fill you all day, the pancakes taste truly homemade, the chorizo has some serious spice, and I'd put Joe's omelets up against anyone's. The potatoes are ok, but then they're barely body temperature by the time I get them. The biscuits are also in the \"meh\" category, but I also eat them without gravy, so your mileage may vary.

It's truly aggravating to have partaken of a restaurant's food and service at its best only to get half that on subsequent visits. I won't rule out return visits, but only if I have tons of patience and time to kill. In the meantime, my search resumes for more local eateries I can call my own. I just know I won't be showing off Joe's anymore."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! I went in with a group 7 we were visiting from Texas. The food was Great but my egg whites were runny, i had ordered them over medium. I sent them back. To my amazement the owner Joe came to our table and berated me for doing so it was humiliating i felt like i was in the twilite zone!! He repeated this 2 more times just to rub it in. Finally i confronted him and was told that because my sister carried in a coffee cup from the hotel, that was why he was treating us so badly? It was the most insane experience I have ever sat through."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want an omelet.  And sometimes it is at lunch time during the middle of the week when the only options to fulfill this craving would be going to Denny's or IHOP.  Lucky for me my office is near Joe's Diner and they serve breakfast all day!

I convinced one of my co-worker's to join me for a mid-week brunch and off we went to Joe's.  If you blink, you might miss it, and even then you might think you are at the wrong place because it looks like a car repair shop.  But inside is a quintessential 50's style diner complete with black and white checkered floors!

We got there a bit before noon and there were only 2 other tables with people, but that soon changed and the place started to fill up.  We both ordered omelets with potatoes and I got a single pancake on the side.

My omelet was delicious, fluffy and filled with ham, peppers, cheese, green chilies and tomatoes with a side of sour cream...and it was huge!  The side of potatoes were delicious, I am normally a hashbrown girl, but these cubed potatoes were seasoned so well that they went perfect with the eggs.

The pancake was one of the best pancakes I have ever had, it was a bit crisp around the edges and when covered in syrup it was melt in your mouth good!

The servers are very pleasant and attentive and the food comes out quick.  I would think that on the weekend this place gets pretty packed....so I am glad that I can get my omelet fix here during the week with no wait!"}
{"text":"OK, I just don't get it...

Yelpers, help me understand why you consistently rate places with 4 or 5 stars that don't even deserve 2 or 3???

I understand everyone has different tastes and there are some people who are fairly forgiving when it comes to food. Others are picky eaters and may not like things that others find delicious. However, I think that most would say dog food tastes yucky and this place is a bit below that.

I am a person with a relatively narrow palate. I am not a foodie. I am a burger and fries kind of guy. I appreciate other foods, but have no real desire to eat a fancy plate of something that looks like it should be photographed, not eaten.

With all that said, this place flat out sucked. It was in desperate need of Restaurant impossible. I can deal with the fact that it is practically in a auto mechanic garage. I can also deal with the relatively dirty place. Hole-in-the-wall places sometimes can have the best food. But this place doesn't.

Their menu is very limited. I ordered a burger. I was a frozen patty that you buy in those large bags, pressed so dense that it would make a good hockey puck. In fact, it tasted like one, with freezer burn and all. It had no seasoning whatsoever and was cooked well-done, even though i ordered it medium rare. 

All I know is that it isn't that hard to make a decent burger, and this place couldn't do it. The breakfast may be good, but I will never return to find out. 

Why, oh why, do Yelpers consistently steer me to the wrong place?"}
{"text":"The Chorizo gravy can be habit forming."}
{"text":"Joes Diner may have lost a some of the ambience it had at the 16th street location,  they  definitely needed more room.  However, they did not lose any quality in their food.
I love, love, love the homemade apple butter.  My eggs are always done perfectly the way I like them and the coffee is really quite good.  My niece loves their pancakes and bacon.
This is my go to place for breakfast.  I have tried others but I always come back to Joes.  Give it a try-they are very reasonably priced ."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I have a soft spot for diners and dives (not so much drive ins). And this place has the traditional diner set up on the inside located in an area of town (the Melrose) that I'm really rooting for to turn into something truly special (it's already pretty cool). But, I just didn't like the food. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was eggs, sausage and cheese on a croissant. The croissant was ehhh ok. The eggs/sausage/cheese was greasy and not very flavorful. It came with a side of potatoes which were also pretty m'eh. I'll give this one another shot at some point."}
{"text":"Great place to get a classic delicious breakfast. Always have a good time here. Awesome coffee. Can never go wrong with the pancakes and I'm not even a pancakes kind of person.  Worth it"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and we finally did last weekend. We will definitely be back soon!

I got eggs cooked over-medium, potatoes, bacon and toast. All was delish and their coffee was great too. My fiance got pancakes along with some other things and they tasted good too!

A great place to go when you want a diner atmosphere. The place is pretty big too, so if there's a wait, you probably won't have to wait long.

Oh and the service was spot on!"}
{"text":"Was treated to this little diner on a trip to Phoenix and was amazed! Great diner food and priced just right."}
{"text":"The food is good quality. The atmosphere is nice. The owner and his wife work hard to make you feel welcome.

Skip the chorizo gravy, everything else is a solid B."}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly service, and a good selection of breakfast items. Their Chorizo items are really good and they even have Chorizo Biscuits and Gravy - yum.
Their pancakes and omelets are good too."}
{"text":"Sunday 11/24.  Out for a Birthday lunch.  Been to Joes several times at old location, but this was my first time at the new location.  Missed being greeted at the door and having to seat myself.  After sitting for 10 minutes without one person acknowledging the fact that we were there was very disturbing.  Mind you there was 4 waitresses on, only 4 other tables in the place and two of the staff were doing their side work on the booths on each side of us. Sooo after waiting for 10 minutes I finally went up to the front register, I think it was \"Joe\" who appoligized and promptly came over and took our drink order.  BTW, we still have no menues.  When he came back to the table he did have menues in hand.  Not even 20 seconds later, one of the waitresses who had been doing the sidework around us but failed to acknowledge us came and asked if we were ready to order.  Ugh No, we just got our menues.  Once our order was placed we thought we were in the clear until another waitress came over with a Ice Tea picture full of sugar and sat it on our table while grabbing the sugar dispenser and proceeded to fill it at our table without saying one word to us, then walked away. \"AMAZING\" not to mention rude.  Of course when the food came everything was wonderful as always.  When we received our Bill, I proceeded to the Restroom while my Friend went to pay the bill.  To my surprise when I came out, he was still standing at the register.  I waited another 5 minutes, so now were talking almost 10 minutes at the register while two staff members are sitting at the counter eating.  I actually called their phone and a waitress came from the back with broom in hand and I told her I'm at the front waiting to pay.  Joe also appeared from a side room and asked the waitress what was wrong, and she told him that we have had a horrible experience since we arrived, \"JOE\" I presume, groaned and walked away.  The waitress did comp our Beverages without asking because she felt bad, but then to top it all off, she said we should come back when they are bussier, their much better then.  Not sure if I'll give it another try!!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits & gravy I've had in a long time! Joe is very personable,  I love the fact the he & his wife take the time to walk around and talk to everyone. Definitely going back for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Joe's seems to really have taken off.  Went here for brunch last week after I rode 13 miles on my bike.  The parking lot was full, and we had to improvise by parking in the center of the lot.  Joe's may want to consider restriping the lot (they have plenty of room for more spaces in the center; parking now is on the periphery only).  There was about a 10-minute wait, and they were in the process of training a hostess.  A friend and I split the waffle and eggs/bacon/potatoes/biscuit.  All was delicious, and I was ravenous.  The only bump came when we tried to pay our bill with a couple of different credit cards.  This seemed to fluster the waitress, who had been brisk and professional until that point.  Had to wait longer for coffee refills than I like, too.  Another friend got the veggie omelet, which looked teriffic.  Oh, and they have a bike rack outside.  Always a plus for me."}
{"text":"I LOVE joes.  It is all you could ask for from a local dive.  Have been going here before their relocation.  Fair prices, good portions and friendly efficient staff.  I've met Joe many times.  Great guy to chat with.  The chorizo biscuits and gravy is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great traditional breakfast spot close to home. The wife and I hit Joe's Diner this morning and we both loved it. I had the corn beef hash with eggs over medium, biscuits n gravy, and potatoes and it was probably the best breakfast I've had since the Hash House a Go Go, San Diego. Excellent food and a great value. Can't wait to try their lunch options. Staff was very cheerful and friendly as well..."}
{"text":"Today we went to Joe's Diner for the first time.  After reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to give it a try - the reviews were right on!  Joe's is great for breakfast.  Classic diner decor, including red vinyl booths.

The food is standard breakfast fare and was great.  Everything was cooked exactly as we asked. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was about to review this restaurant praising them for how good it is and I hear the owner Joe talk to a couple of customers in the middle of the restaurant bad mouthing reviews from Yelp. I don't care what you think, Joe, but customers take a lifetime to acquire and a minute to lose them!!! You should be GREATFUL for every comment, your food can be made at home and easily purchased somewhere else. When we take a few seconds of our lives to write a review, it's because we want to help you succeed, pay attention to every review, read between the lines and your restaurant would be the best, not just good.  I like your food, that's why I'm giving you 2 stars, I was about to give 5 stars but you insulted me and every person that take the time to review your place, you have something going, don't ruin it by feeling you are too good to fail!"}
{"text":"We had very high hopes for the new location. However, things haven't come together just yet. I will give them another chance, in a few weeks to see if things (food) get back to the old ways. I sure hope so!"}
{"text":"Food was good, priced right.
The service was great, my water nor coffee never touched bottom.
The ham steak was massive and the biscuits and gravy could be heart attack inducing (that's a good thing).

A nice little place, well actually not so little, there is a larger back room I didn't really get into with a window that looks into the hot rod joint next door. Nothing really more to add about the pseudo 50's style interior.

\"Good grub\" is what I told the man at the counter as I finished paying and was heading out. 
That pretty much sums it up.
Good grub."}
{"text":"If you want a fantastic breakfast with great food and friendly service you must eat here. The chorizo omelette was to die for. The biscuits and gravy are great, as are the pancakes. Everything is made from scratch  with local ingredients. Make sure you try the organic strawberry jam. Joe is very attentive and friendly. Intend to go back often."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good. Fast friendly service.  Good help with menu recommendations.  Food was out in a flash, yet the eggs were obviously cooked fresh and my request for over easy was cooked properly. 

As an ol country boy from TN, I have made the search for decent biscuits and gravy in Arizona a personal mission of over 7 years now.  These were good contenders. The gravy is primo.  The biscuits were good but not quite as outstanding as the gravy.  An extra minute or 2 too long in the oven can make a great biscuit reduce to good by making the bottom a little tough instead just firm.  Therfore, 95% of each biscuit was actually great as well. 

Coffee was also excellent. I drink it black and I don't love $tarburnts.  If you like old school black coffee with coffee in your coffee, then Joe's has that ebony nectar your grandparents loved. 

 I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite. No longer. 7:30 on a Sunday with one guy in the diner. We are yelled from the back to sit by two girls and served iced cold potatoes, sausage, hash, and eggs. Ew gross. No thanks. We won't be back. When Joe is there everything is always awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, amazing-highly addictive pancakes!  And their homemade jams & jellies are the best!"}
{"text":"We love Joe's Diner and eat there whenver we are in Phoenix. The food is great and I know that the owners love their work and have a passion for good food. The restaurant is in a converted garage (which Joe loves) and they have fixed up the place to a fun 50's type of environment. Highly recommend them for good food, great service and really nice people."}
{"text":"This is THE ONLY place that I will go for pancakes! They are so buttery, smooth and heavenly. The potatoes are also a must have. 

For the rare occasions that I decide no pancakes at Joe's they have a vegetarian option of eggplant parmesan. It is fantastic! Pair with the slaw and you'll be in heaven. 

The owners also help with serving and they are super nice! As a matter of fact, all of the servers are amazing."}
{"text":"We visited Joe's on Tuesday, July 7th at approximately 11:00am.  Wow!  Seriously...Way over priced and some of the food was terrible, not all.   First off, price. You can get almost the same amount of food and decent quality at the local chain for at least  a 1/3 less the cost.  Almost all the breakfast selections were near $10.00.  We like to support the local merchant, so this is a big part of why we decided to try Joe's.   I see that they have gotten pretty good rating here on Yelp, but our food was so bad I literally could not eat it. Two of the 6 of us ordered the corn beef hash and eggs.  The hash was seriously the consistency of runny oatmeal.  Hidden under the over medium eggs.  I can eat just about anything.  I literally could not gag this down.  When I called the server over she immediately agreed.  I said I would have the same as the person sitting across the table form me, the other person who ordered said she would pass on another choice, lost her appetite. So I waited and waited and finally my meal came out.  They did take the corn beef hash and eggs off our ticket, but the added the meal that was my second choice, for $2.00 more.  So not only was my first meal absolutely awful, my second meal that I had to wait for cost me $2.00 more than I planned on spending.  Not good customer relations in my opinion.  We will be hard pressed to visit again.  Only giving 2 stars because the pancakes were good."}
{"text":"went here with matty for some french toast. it was reasonably priced and super yummy. one thing though, was that i wanted a side of ham, instead of bacon or whatever, that ham was almost four bucks! it wasnt listed on the menu as an a la carte item but i wanted it with my french toast and eggs anyway and i was totally shocked! their juice is also expensive- around 4 bucks a glass, but it taste so good(like they squezzed or pressed it there) that i was satisfied. its not very kid friendly because its pretty loudand seating is tables and booths. was super busy when we went but it was totally worth it, we wanted to try matts big breakfast, but saw a review for here and went here and skipped the two hour wait and we are glad we did! definitely check it out. just dont bring your babies,theres not a kids menu and the hustle bustle is a little over stimulating, our five year old would have not eaten a bite !"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Steak and Eggs, biscuits and gravy, and eggs benedict were all great."}
{"text":"Bad coffee.  No excuse for breakfast place.  Weak and not hot.  Food was just okay and very pricey."}
{"text":"The food was solid! No-frills, straight up homemade diner fare. My breakfast burrito was excellent, but what made this place really enjoyable was the service. The owners were working; they introduced themselves and made us feel right at home. This is the kind of local business I love to support, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's diner home style food. Friendly staff. Neighborhood feel. I enjoyed my corned beef hash and eggs.  The home made biscuit with sausage gravy is delicious! Good place to have breakfast after those late nights"}
{"text":"It was ok.  I was seated fast and I chose the counter.  Service could have been better for sure."}
{"text":"Average Joe's Diner. The new location opened just down the street and after reading some reviews my family and I decided to give it a try for breakfast. This was very much your typical greasy spoon breakfast and I would say that I have had much better breakfast else where in the neighborhood. We were seated within 8 minutes of walking in however the total time was over an hour and a half. It took what seemed forever to get out 4 food items and it was not worth the wait. Everyone's plate was cold and eggs over cooked. Kids did not like the pancakes and I would say they are not very good either. This place offers nothing special and not worth the long wait for cold food."}
{"text":"Solid brreakfast and lunch place where they don't thumb their nose at you and the price won't break the bank.  Biscuits and gravy are tasty.  Coffee so good you want a second cup."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. Two of my friends got food poisoning from eating here and both times I've been the food was cold. The other two times I've had their food I picked it up to go and they forgot part of my order or got it wrong completely (even though I had them repeat it back to me). Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Had the #2 breakfast special. Melt in your
 mouth pancakes n tje best bacon in central Phoenix. Fast, friendly service too. About 11 bucks with tip. Recommend"}
{"text":"We love Joe's for breakfast and lunch. Great service and terrific food. Very kid friendly which is a plus. The new location is spacious and nicely decorated. The pancakes are the best---love the syrup!!!  Keep up the great work Joe and staff. We'll see you soon."}
{"text":"Seriously simple and good.  We went on a saturday for some straightforward diner breakfast.  What we got was exactly that and good service: a bunch of hard-working ladies.  The pancakes were fabulous (tall stack) plus a side of eggs over easy.  Just go, it's simple and don't expect more than what it is . .. a dine opened 7-3."}
{"text":"Joe's Diner is a hidden local gem.  Everything is made there - on a recent visit I had breakfast there.  The pancakes rock!  The eggs were cooked perfectly and served with some very tasty bacon.

Service is prompt and friendly.  Great locally owned place for Lunch or breakfast"}
{"text":"I grew up in the family business of a luncheonette (on the east coast) and felt right at home when I first entered Joe's Diner.  His pancakes and home-made syrup is like eating a \"home-made\" breakfast.  Joe will come to see his customers to make sure everything is just-right.  I recommend Joe's Diner with no hesitation for perfect old-fashioned diner food."}
{"text":"This is an amazing home town diner with great food and wonder people.  When my son and I go we always know we will get quality food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Always love to find a new locally owned breakfast joint... sorry to say Joe's was a big disappointment. The service is horrible, even though the owner does come out and talk to folks (found him to not be the best front man, as he was a bit annoying) Waited to be acknowledged, get a menu, get coffee... had to ask for my toast twice and it didn't show up until the rest of my breakfast was gone. 
The owner came over and bragged himself up, which made it even more painful to see what he considers good simple home cooking. I had the Chirizo omelet.. when it came out I couldn't even tell it was an omelet!! Looked like a scrambled mess, and cold, as were the potatoes. They were just potatoes with season salt. The toast was the only warm thing, which showed up last! My husband had the two eggs, bacon (nothing special) sausage patties, and short stake. He said the taste of the pancakes was ok, but the were flat. 
All and all, I just don't know why more breakfast places can't follow a few simple rules: don't have 100 items on the menu, maybe just 10.. but make them out of the best ingredients and make them good. Have good coffee... even with all the bragging and little memo card about the coffee here, it was mediocre at best. And have good service. Sorry Joe, it's a no go for me."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Joe is s class act and treats his customers very well. With that said I can't recommend this place. Our food was cold, the biscuit was hard as a rock and the water wasn't drained from the poached eggs. Maybe it was a one time thing but I won't be coming back to try again. Sorry Joe"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but service is SLOW for larger groups. Been there on several occasions with my cycling group on Sunday mornings. They're not equipped for large groups."}
{"text":"I love this place!

Delicious food, huge portions and great prices."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and the biscuits and gravy were awful the supposed homemade biscuits tasted like the ones from shamrock foods and the gravy was lukewarm and tasted like flour for the price i was seriously underwhelmed"}
{"text":"Ordered eggs poachedhard, every place I go they do it,  Dennys, Cracker  Barrel, etc. They brought eggs out soft I asked if they could be cooked more because  I asked for them hard, no I could have boiled eggs. They had the Grey around the yolk and taste different, not what I wanted, didn't  eat yolk. Seriously,  every place else can handle ut!

2 stars because they were playing  Christmas  music!

The bacon, chorizo gravy and eggs  were good, spicy!

Selection  of tea when you get hot tea.

I  won't  go back, too many other choices.when I spoke to the female owner /wsitress/cashier about the eggs, how the boiled eggs were different,  not what I wanted, unappealing,  not as good, her reply was that they cook poached eggs 3 1/2 minutes  because that is the law...that is the minimum, but you can cook them more!!! I explained  that I get them that way every place I go and if places like Dennys ca get it right, there is no excuse for them or to.  It was like  talking to a brick wall. She didn't  care, so much for the customer being right!"}
{"text":"Man oh Man....don't know what is up with it, but is seems to be going down a slippery slope fast...everything is slipping, from service to food...   :(   :(   :("}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday morning with a party of 8 people. The place was right off the road and canal, very convenient parking and we were seated right away. 

Food: Delicious diner breakfast! Not too greasy and the plates were enough to share. The prices averaged $8-11am per person. 

I will definitely visit again. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great at a great price. We were surprised on our first visit when the owner Joe came and introduced himself. Then our car battery died and he came out not only jumped our car but took the time to pour baking soda on the wires. Thanks for the great warm service."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here. I am glad to have them in the neighborhood. I am really sorry that it has such bad reviews below mine. But we met Joe and I am sure that he has taken these reviews seriously and will fix whatever the problems were that caused these negative reviews. The coffee was great. The meal was very good. The food fresh. The service was good. The only reason I didn't give five stars is I feel I want to go back time and time again to be sure of it's five star rating."}
{"text":"Eh. Stopped in hoping for a great breakfast experience. Eh. I was disappointed. Menu is a regular diner breakfast menu standard fare. Service was fairly speedy but my food was cold.  Try it you might enjoy it more than I did."}
{"text":"This place is not much to look at, at ALL!

In fact, it has windows that look directly into a tow/auto repair shop... so that is weird but interesting.

And if you're thinking that you can compare it to a hole in the wall breakfast joint with some up and coming chef that's slumming it in a breakfast joint, you will be sorely disappointed.

It's a diner.
A DINER.
That doesn't say Fancy, Urban, Fusion or any other random word in front of it... just DINER... owned by some guy named Joe.

So as long as you're expecting diner style food, then you'll be ecstatic because the food here (well, the food I had) is delicious!

I had the biscuits and gravy, because it's a staple in diner food, but with Chorizo and Ooooohhhhhh my gosh it was rich and delicious!!! 

I also had the coffee, and it was alright. Not amazing, just alright. But that's expected at a diner.

And I ate some of a cinnamon roll that was freakin' om nom nomz in my mouth.

I would go here over Denny's, IHOP or any of those other chains because they suck. A lot.

This place does not suck.

So, come to your own conclusion."}
{"text":"We come here all the time on Sunday and today horrible. Took 49 minutes to get our food & then the poached eggs were hard boiled. Now we are waiting for the kitchen to make the whole meal again. The coffee in our mugs are cold! 

The waitress was gracious and apologized. She also comped our meals. The pancake was burnt & looked gross so it was not eaten. My waffle was good. I never received my biscuits & gravy. My husband received a burnt, cold, rubbery pancake. 

So disappointed as the service & food are usually consistent and good. 

It is quite obvious that Joe is not here today."}
{"text":"I have 3 stars, my family and I went to the previous location several times before they moved.  This was our first time at the new one.  If I didn't know they had only been here a few weeks it would have been a one star review.  For starters Joe assumed my mother in law was my wife, which started things off a bit awkward, but then it took roughly 30 minutes to get our food.  This was attributed to there being 'half power'.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with the cherizo gravy and when it came out, it was undercooked and the breading was mushy, and they didn't put the cherizo gravy on it.  I sent it back and they were quick about replacing but forgot the cherizo gravy again.  I asked for some on the side and it was watery.  Out sever seemed frustrated as well and I had to ask for simple things several times, silverware, water refill, things that should be monitored by a good server. I will come back to Joes, but not for a while, I will give them a chance to get their footing at this new place before going back."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast menu with the normal staples. The Chorizo biscuits and gravy were spicy and rich with moist house made biscuits... the French toast was below average and plain. The coffee and service were great."}
{"text":"No wait on a Sunday morning. Moderately slow service that is disorganized, although they are friendly. The corned beef hash is mostly potatoes, easy on the beef. Oatmeal was divine. Chorizo gravy wasn't our favorite. It's a cute divey diner, support your local business."}
{"text":"I was the birthday girl and have to agree with Az W. Unfortunately, I suggested the place when asked where I would like to go for lunch.We hadn't been to Joe's Diner so I thought that we would give the \"\"new guy on the block\" a try. - Sorry - not a good experience.."}
{"text":"Best diner in the valley!  Best of all, its privately owned!

Food here is great!  Biscuits and Gravy mmmmmmm yummy!  Food is fresh and delicious!  Will be going back here over and over again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Amazing food....the owners are super nice and even work the floor! Pancakes melt in your mouth, I highly recommend those!"}
{"text":"Joe is the man. I went here with my buddy one time and he came right over to the table to talk to us both-- about the business his life and ...oh yes I almost forgot. pancake batter. Yum yum yum. Joe's pancakes are legitimate. I come from NE so I am pretty picky about my pancakes -- these were great and also they came with eggs bacon all the good stuff solid Americans love. 
Great diner with a chill classic feel (its connected to a garage-- that you can even look into!)."}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast here. Eggs, fries, toast, pancakes, and bacon were all tried between the two of us and it was all cooked perfectly.  The service was great too - very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Joe's has been our go to place for breakfast since they open,always good food & great service."}
{"text":"They were packed so it took a bit to get breakfast but the staff really hustled and the coffee was very good for a diner. 'Joe' even came out to check on people who were waiting."}
{"text":"Had the number 1 for breakfast. Sat at the counter because I was by myself. Was ignored for the most part because the waitress had to leave. Food tasted good but it would have been better hot. A bit pricey compared to other places I've been in Phoenix. Not as impressed as I would have thought given the crowd."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, if you been to one diner you have been to them all. The food is ok, nothing to write home about and I like to judge my diner food off one entree, biscuits an gravy. Joe's has 2 different types, a sweet sausage and chorizo; I had the sweet sausage and yeah I'm not impressed. I had a burger, I'd like to def try their omelets next time we go. Awesome frys and customer service!!"}
{"text":"\"Best diner in Phoenix\"

That's what my husband said as we left our brunch at Joe's today.  We love our diners when we actually decide to go to them.  We got pretty spoiled when we lived in San Francisco, frequenting the Mel's Drive In on Geary which was within walking distance of our apartment.  We can't walk to Joe's (though we could bicycle) but it certainly hits the spot.

We've been eyeing it for quite some time.  We live in the Coronado and drive past it often.  Always with a full parking lot, we say to each other \"we really need to try that place\".  We've seen the reviews here on yelp... and yet again we repeat it.

Today we went.  In 30 minutes we'd been seated, fed, paid, the whole shebang.  Joe came by the table and hi.  We both got the Number Two with pancakes.  Yum.  My husband was thrilled with his poached eggs.  I was just happy to have pancakes for the first time in months.  It was busy but not too busy.  We were seated right away (just after 12pm on a Sunday).

Next time I really want to try the biscuits & gravy.  We'll also be taking my parents here when they come into town to visit.  The price is right and the food is good.

Yum."}
{"text":"Cold leftovers from a Continental Breakfast at your local Holiday Inn would seem like gourmet cuisine when compared to this...  Today was the first and last time I'll ever eat here.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Went by this place for a bite and I was really impressed. The owner, Joe personally came to my table to see how things were. I offer him a seat for minute just to talk and he obliged. 

The menu had a great array of breakfast items and the place was busy... always a good sign. The food came in large portions but not too much that it lost any class, flavor or appeal. Tasty and hot. My glass was always filled and I really appreciated the time there eating. 

Lots of parking and I wasn't rushed at all.

It was clean and it was busy yet I really enjoyed a great breakfast

Joe was a great guy and I am going to return again soon as I'm done with this review... well as soon as my radiator is replaced right now... then I'm going.

Why five and not four stars? Are they perfect? No they aren't however it was a great breakfast on a day I wasn't felling well and that I felt good afterwards it was clean, although busy not too loud at all. I was recognized as a person not a paycheck as I felt I should be treated and joe the owner took tine from other guests orders to sit and talk with me although he wa short staffed and talking orders himself. I felt respected there and I left wanting to just sleep the day away I was so full of good food"}
{"text":"Do not get any sides for breakfast unless you wanna eat it later their portion sizes are amazing and I always make this mistake everything I tried so far is great even the steak! People are very nice and some place I always think about going to in the morning"}
{"text":"We went for a Saturday morning breakfast, and it was packed.  We didint have to wait for a table, and the service was very fast and friendly.  A lot of kids in the place so it was very loud. 

I ordered the chorizo omelet. It was fantastic! It came with old country potatoes, and biscuits with gravy. The biscuits stole the show.  I usually don't drink OJ, but i  am glad I ordered some because it was fresh squeezed, and fantastic! Not the crap you drink at ihop. 

Overall it was great breakfast food.  Good place to go if you can handle the noise factor."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new brunch place and stumbled upon Joe's diner. Everyone was friendly, including Joe. I had the border omelette and my wife had the breakfast bowl. We split the Belgian waffle for dessert. Everything was great, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Forget Starbucks, they have the best coffee here. As a European it's clear that they don't know how to make coffee in America, until you get to Joe's diner. They have the story behind their coffee on their menu. The servers think apparently so too, as one brought me a cup and 5 seconds later another offered me a refill when I hadn't started yet. And she asked me if I was sure.

The pastrami sandwich was good. Not excellent, have had better.
If I could come in just for a fix of coffee I would be very happy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hangs when I have ahnklering for plain simple good food- The PANCAKES and WAFFLES are amazing.  The meatloaf is die for.  The owners have years of experience in food service and it shows."}
{"text":"Followed Nader's advice and tried the #2, but I got it with the potatoes instead of the pancakes. It was awesome! Excellent quality and flavor cooked to perfection. Service was quick and friendly. I saw lots of other things I want to go back and try,like the pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. This is going to be one of my favorite breakfast places!"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and thought I was coming for a great meal...boy was I wrong. The girls and I showed up for an early lunch to celebrate a birthday. It turned into a 2 hour dissapointment. The birthday girl and I ordered the Thursday special, open roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes over texas toast. What I was expecting wasn't what I got. What I got was a gray gloppy slop of what I guess was supposed to be gravy over store bought beef, so-so mashed potatoes and texas toast. And the taste? I can't describe it. What would it take to get some good beef and cook it. Why use store bought? 

The other girls in the group ordered various breakfast items and from what was said they also were disappointed. From the cold potatoes to the bland biscuits the whole experience was bad. I know that every restaurant has it's bad days but I get the sense that this was a normal day for them. 

As much as we like small locally owned places to eat we won't be back"}
{"text":"It's too bad we weren't able to experience Joes since we'd been there for 10 minutes and no one even said hello to us let alone bother to take our order. never again. They are clearly understaffed."}
{"text":"Biscuits made from scratch, not frozen.
Homemade pancakes with real buttermilk, not from a mix or box.
Homemade blueberry jam, no jar or can.
True diner coffee.
A group of friendly, engaging staff.
Five stars..... Need I say more."}
{"text":"A first breakfast review ... Joe's is a great place to start. Joe's is a diner in the full classical sense: 50s period furnishings, a simple menu, and good coffee. The place was busy, which is good to see. I was greeted and promptly seated by who I later found to be the owner, Joe. I give HUGE plus points when an owner actively manages and WORKS on the floor of his or her business. Customers seem to be from a wide cross section of the community.

On to the food quality portion of the review. Breakfast food quality reviews tend to be the most blunt for me because there is not a lot of room for error. Many dishes simply involve frying or grilling, and more complex diner breakfast dishes are still relatively simple. The standard for breakfast is : simple dishes require perfect execution. Joe's rose to the challenge. It performed very well. 

I ordered the #2 : 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage and 2 pancakes. I tend to order eggs scrambled soft. I like them that way, and find it a good way to test the capabilities of the cook. Unlike most places, my eggs were scrambled soft, as ordered, and, they don't use liquid eggs. Bravo! The bacon, was crisp, but not crunchy (a very subtle but important distinction). Ths sausage patties look to be hand formed, and a nice light brown shade (not the dark brown that we're accustomed to). Now, the pancakes. They were awesome. Soft, fluffy, simple, and NOT PERFECTLY ROUND (it's a good thing). All the food looked to be hand crafted and not Sysco Pancake #12345 and Sausage Patty #23456. Execution was not completely perfect, but very good. The coffee was delicious and just the right accompaniment to breakfast. 

Service was good, but a bit slow. There is a good excuse. After all, it was a busy Saturday morning. Other than that, service was attentive, my coffee cup was always full, and the check was handled quickly and efficiently. All in all, a good example of simple, diner cuisine. 

GRADES

Overall: A-

Food Quality:  A-        Excellent preparation of the eggs, bacon and sausage. Pancakes were very good, but didn't quite rise to the level of excellent. 

Service:  B+    Yes, it was a Saturday and there were a lot of people, but service could have been a bit faster. There was a decent size wait for both my order to be taken and for food to come out. A minor defect in an otherwise great experience. 

Beverage: N/A -  Drinking at 10:00 AM? No, ... I may like my booze, but 10:00 AM is way too early. Oh, and Joe's does not serve any alcohol. 

Discretionary Points: The fact that the owner was there, working in his business was really inspiring to see. Nice to meet you Joe. Also the ambiance and furniture, is very 1950's diner, very nicely done! 

And before someone complains - why not five stars? Well, I reserve the \"Five Star\" designation for restaurants that earn an overall of a \"high-A\" or an \"A+\" on my grading scale."}
{"text":"This diner has the feel of a local establishment that's been successful for 30+ year's. The Pancakes are awesome! My wife loved the eggs Benedict.  The service is excellent. The owner, Joe, was very nice. We will be back and bring our friends next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. The corn beef hash is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Excellent Service! Thank you Joe's! Yum!
I had the number two and my bro had the chorizo biscuits and gravy and Joe's did not disappoint! Love how they are so kind and personable. Joe and Joan (the owners) walked around and talked to all the guests at their tables and checked in to make sure everything was great... It was! Thanks again! This California Girl was not disappointed"}
{"text":"So yummy! Wait staff are all super friendly. The chicken fried steak was bomb, the gravy was delicious! Definitely try the chorizo biscuits and gravy as well ! For sure my favorite place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We had an amazing  breakfast,  Joe is very nice, provides excellent customer service and knows what he is doing.
Great food and great vibe.  Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"The workers here were so friendly!  We went on a busy Saturday morning and it seemed like everyone there was a regular.  The place was super clean.

Saturday's special is the Monte Christo sandwich and that totally stoked husband - he's been craving it since Bennigan's closed.  The sandwich wasn't totally battered and fried like the Bennigan's version but he still loved it.  They also had two different fruit dips for the sandwich - the standard raspberry and also seedless blackberry.  I had pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon.  The pancakes seemed a little off to my liking- maybe a little too much baking soda?  It could just be me - next time I'll try the french toast instead.  Very happy we tried this place and would go more ofen if we lived closer. We stopped here after hiking North Mountain."}
{"text":"Me and the little woman love to go to Joe's now and then and I must say it is a great place to meet if you are wanting to have breakfast with a few friends. Excellent round banquet tables, with lazy-susans always make the meetings fun and easy to converse with one another and pass the homemade jellies.

Joe was a big fella like me once and most of the menu is not friendly for us low-carb peeps. However if you order the Joe's breakfast bowl and substitute fresh spinach for the home fries, it is a very tasty zero carb item that will suffice. Get a side of bacon, it's terrific.

Thanks Joe"}
{"text":"Went to Joes this morning! First off after about 3 mins of sitting down i got to meet Joe and shake is hand! He is awesome and was sold on the place after that. I ordered the combo with two eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon it was great! The wait staff is super courteous and attentive. Will be going back many times to this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big breakfast kind of guy. I'm more the type that eats his lunch for breakfast, then another lunch for lunch. 

A few times a year I get the desire, dare I say the NEED to eat a nice big breakfast. Sunday was just such a day. I chose Joe's. 

Joe's opened the same week that I moved to Phoenix. I've driven by it almost every day since the opening, yet this was my first time dining there. 

Parking was easy thanks to the big lot. My parents and I were promptly seated in a giant booth in the back. The atmosphere was super comfortable, with a very clean diner/car shop feel to it. 

The menu is a throwback to the good ole' days of diner foods. The breakfast menu is every basic desire you could have. The lunch menu has some very tantalizing options too, but I was here for the breakfast. 

#2 was ordered by all, with scrambled eggs. They should rename the #2 'perfection,' serving up sausage, bacon, eggs and pancakes. The folks got coffee, a blend from Tucson. I'm not typically a coffee drinker, but this coffee is the kind that I'd really enjoy black. Next time! 

Thanks to our friendly and efficient server the food was promptly delivered to the table. The eggs were well cooked and the bacon was perfectly crisped. The sausage was delicious, though I prefer it cooked just a wee bit more. And then there were the pancakes. 

Others here have nailed it in regards to the pancakes. They rock! These thin, crispy Frisbees of delight are packed with flavor. I loved nearly every bite. Sadly, the last bite defeated me. 

Having a great place like this within minutes from my home is both a blessing and a curse. Needless to say, I'll be coming back frequently. 

One last thing to note: If you've eaten at Joe's you've met Joe. He's constantly out busing tables and chatting up the customers. He takes great pride in what he's doing and really seems to care. In a brief conversation Joe summed up the three things he thought his restaurant needed improvement on, and what he was doing to resolve them. This place deserves to succeed. Be a sport and support Joe!"}
{"text":"Literally the best pancakes ever. Not exaggerating. You may think the atmosphere is whatever but who cares. The pancakes make up for it. And they aren't overpriced. Nor are they pretentious hipster cakes. They're just plain old pancakes. Truly amazing. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been here a couple of times and it has always been pretty good. Today, not so much.  Sat down and got our drinks, ordered our food. 40 minutes later, our waitress keeps saying our food will be right up. 
Then, the table next to us, arrived after us received their meal first!  Then we asked our waitress about our food, \" Oh, they are just starting to make it now\". Are you kidding me? 
Needless to say, 50 minutes of wasting my time. We walked out and you lost my business for good."}
{"text":"If a simple but perfect breakfast is what you crave, this is the spot! There's no pork belly on the menu but what there is is great homestyle vittles! The coffee is great and they keep filling it up and never try to rush ya out! I am a regular weekend customer and even during the rush you feel like the only table there. And how often does that happen these days?? You can get a pancake instead of toast!  AWESOME And as a pancake snob I endorse these 100&"}
{"text":"This little place is right in my neighborhood and I've eaten there several times now!  I love breakfast at any time of the day and the long weekend allowed me to eat there twice .  I love their coffee, service, and the overall friendly vibe.  The homemade jam, chorizo gravy, and biscuits are all yummy. I am also a fan of the breakfast potatoes, a  side dish I usually don't get too excited about. The egg \"guide\" on the menu is entertaining and the food is consistently well prepared.  My dining companions tried the burgers and pronounced them delicious.  They came with a side of fried onions that were a yummy surprise---try them as a side instead of fries and add a chocolate shake for the ultimate diner experience.  These folks are integral part of the neighborhood and I'm glad to have them so close!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Joe's Diner this morning.  I had the number 2, and a side of potatoes.  It was supposed to come with 2 bacon and 2 sausage, but for some reason, mine came with four pieces of bacon.  I didn't question it because the waitress seemed a little absent minded and we had to ask for a side that she had already forgotten.  The few times she came to check on us, she would ask if everything was ok and would walk away so fast that we couldn't tell her what we needed.  The positive here is that the pancakes were REALLY tasty.   I would have given Joe's 4 stars if the service was better, but I think there could be some improvement there."}
{"text":"Had the Breakfast Croissant with Ham & extra crispy Potatoes - BOMB! Get it, Get it! Next time I'm Gettin' a Side of their Chorizo Gravy to dip the potatoes in......Can't wait!

Fabulous true to form Diner! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service! Never disappointed when eating at Joe's! The servers are quick with a smile and always makes sure we are taken care of. The food is typical diner food, just what you would expect from a diner, pricing seems to be right in line with most other Phoenix diners and your coffee is always filled up!"}
{"text":"It's sad that a few other people review this diner so harshly. Joe has a heart of gold. This is scratch cooking. Not fancy but pure whole food done diner style. His fresh buttermilk pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever had. The hostess is lovely. She's autistic and Joe has given her a wonderful opportunity for her to learn, grow and work. There should be more community restaurants like this with people who care but aren't caught up in anything but good food, great values and good people. Thank you Joe. Your restaurant is a Phoenix institution and will be for years to come!  Go get yourself some pancakes!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to go for a spectacular breakfast. The food is outstanding and the portions very generous. The owner Joe and his wife welcome people in and say goodbye as they leave. This is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try, given they were just down the street from us.  I'm not really a breakfast person, and if the place doesn't have waffles, you definitely won't find me there (sorry 5th Ave Diner).  Since our first visit, we've taken a few friends there on different occasions so they can \"eat at Joe's.\"  Everyone has liked their food so far, though none of us are really a fan of the potatoes.

The food is decent, but they tend to forget to give us our toast (3 out of 4 times).  The wandering waiters and waitresses are great at attempting to refill your coffee cup, even if it has a teabag in it :)  Joe even comes around and talks to people.

On another note, when I'm in a hurry, I'll stop in and grab a cinnamon bun to-go.  They aren't overly sweet like most cinnamon buns are, so it's easy to take it all in.

We'll be heading here for breakfast everytime chance we get!"}
{"text":"Reading the negative reviews, I have to wonder if they are written by a competing restaurant owner because they are so completely inaccurate. The service was fast, the staff friendly, and the food delicious. I had the Number One - Ham Steak, Egg, Biscuits and Gravy. The ham was lean and tasty, the egg cooked perfectly, and the biscuits and gravy perfect and flavorful. My son had delicious French Toast. My other son ordered hash browns and the waitress pointed out they are breakfast potatoes, just to be sure we wouldn't be disappointed, and we weren't - the potatoes were so good everyone at the table raved about them. 

I don't know how I have lived here this long an never been to Joe's, but we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love having this place in our hood. The owners are super sweet and recognize you as a regular on your second visit. The food is standard diner fare and super filling. The Arbuckles Coffee is outstanding, and I like that they serve RC instead of the \"top two\". When you eat here, you're supporting a local, indie mom & pop restaurant and investing in your community. I'll take that over a chain any day of the week. A wonderful addition to the M7 community and this diner enriches the CenPho neighborhood in more ways than I can write.  Now, if we could only convince them to go 24 hours, I'd be in hog heaven!"}
{"text":"This place was a very random stop for us.  My husband wanted breakfast and I wanted lunch, so we decided to try Joe's on our friend's recommendation.  I was really surprised by what we found.

Atmosphere.  If you've ever read a review from me, you know I'm all about the vibe.  This place cracked me up.  It's everything a diner should be, with an unexpected twist. There is a counter to belly-up to, red booths, basic decor, and for the twist, a window into a working mechanic's garage.  The only issue I may have is that where we sat (in the way back) it was a little dark and cold.  Overall, I liked the vibe.

Food.  Everything on the menu seemed very basic.  Nothing hoity-toity; nothing that stood out as gourmet.  Ryan ordered pancakes, eggs, and sausage.  He said they were all really good.  Plus, they brought out a lot of syrup which thrilled him.  I ordered the cheeseburger.  It's a big burger by my standards - 8 oz.  They serve it with a brioche bun, which is the perfect burger accessory in my opinion.  I lathered it up with mayo and ketchup, stacked my tomato, pickle, and onion, and dug in.  The bun was the perfect amount of squishy and the meat was juicy and had a slight flavoring from the griddle.  The fries were thicker but not too thick, crispy,  and had a nice seasoning to them.   It was a standard all-American burger that wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but definitely a burger I would happily eat again.

Service.  The service was great.  We had a few people bring us food, drinks, whatever.  They seem very eager to please without being overbearing.  Plus, Joe himself came over to say hi.  He's a very passionate man and clearly loves what he does.  I think it shows in his product.

Price.  Cheap.  'Nough said.

Overall.  Great place to go for hangover food, comfort food, or just quality food where everyone in the bunch can find something on the menu that they like.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"After checking out all the reviews on here, I decided to take my mom to Joe's.  I had passed by a few times and since Matt's would have taken to long, Joe's seemed like a perfect choice.  

I like the look of the place.  It feels like an old-timey diner and there is something so right about that.  The service was great.  My mom even had to turn the server away for extra coffee.  The menu was basic with a few interesting selections.  I went for the chorizo scramble with potatoes and a biscuit.  I liked the scramble well enough, but it didn't dazzle me.  The potatoes were seasoned well, but half were hard and half were crispy and soft inside.  The biscuit was average.  That being said, the prices were super reasonable.  

Solid breakfast, but not the best the valley has to offer."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Diner! It's just a traditional diner and the food is amazing! I love the corned beef hash. The staff is friendly and speed of service is good! I highly recommend Joe's Diner!"}
{"text":"The service is very good except the coffee was a little slow to get refilled. Give them the benefit of the doubt, they may have had to make a new pot, and they were busy. Ordered the Hash with 3 eggs, it comes with biscuits and gravy. This is the gravy I've been looking for, many places can't seem to get it right. The decor was 1960's diner, booths and pictures of Marilyn, even a jukebox, but it didn't seem to be working. The coffee was Arbuckle's Ariosa, the coffee that won the West, very good. I'm tracking it down to get some for home. Roasted in Tucson."}
{"text":"got some takeout breakfast was great called it in drove over parking was plentiful  they still take cash ,drove home was great pancakes and Denver omelets  chicken fried steak ,we will be back"}
{"text":"The service was poor we had to ask for refills, and when the server poured it she dripped all over my friends feet then the floor and didn't apologize. My veggie omelet was the only thing hot on my plate, but was dry. The biscuits were so cold and hard the butter didn't even melt. My friends got the biscuits and gravy and his was cold too his 2 eggs over easy were so undercooked that the egg white was still runny and not cooked. Giving them 1 star in hopes that the lunch menu is better than the breakfast. I'm hesitant to even waste time and money to try it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I miss their old location but the new location has more room. It's great to see Joe and Joe working and talking to all the customers"}
{"text":"The location is close and does have that take you back in time diner type feel, but lacks in service. The owner himself is very personable, however, my waitress was less than remotely friendly... To me at least. 

I walked in and was not greeted, looked at, or spoken to for 5 minutes when the place was maybe 1/4 full. My food was plopped in front of me, the waitress didn't even look in my direction, say a word, or bat an eyelash when I thanked her for the clanking of the dishes as they hit the table. 

The owner himself at least asked how my food was and smiled mid meal. However, my server after I was obviously finished just quickly placed the check on my table and left. No eye contact, no thank you, no acknowledgment that I am a human being. 

The food was okay... Luke warm when it arrived in front of me. While the portions are decent, there are other places who have provided much better service with similar, if not better quality food. My eggs were slightly undercooked and potatoes under seasoned. 

While the cuisine may being you initially to a restaurant, the service is what will keep customers coming back. Who knows... Maybe she was having a bad day, but to not even make eye contact is rather offensive. Funniest thing about it is that she was eager to help other patrons, just not me. 

Two stars for the owner's effort and mediocre food. I wish I had experienced the same as the other reviewers here. I am rather disappointed."}
{"text":"Ample parking and seating. The Arbuckle's coffee is robust, flavorful and not at all bitter.
Try it iced.
I had the pan seared turkey wrap with Thousand Island dressing. The pan seared turkey beats the usual cold cut turkey by a Mississippi mile and the wrap itself is huge and tasted great.
The apple pie is very sweet and the crust was flaky and not the least bit soggy. Not bad.
I also had a small bite of the meatloaf which was very tasty.
I will be back for the breakfast next time AND MORE ICED COFFEE!!!"}
{"text":"I went by myself to have some french toast and a cup of coffee.  I ordered a couple of eggs on the side and never got them.  I ordered ONE sausage patty and got two; both were not very flavorful.  The french toast was nothing to write home about; the coffee was so-so.  The people there were really nice and they adjusted my bill with no fuss.  I doubt I'll go back to Joe's."}
{"text":"Found out that he tries to use local Arizona products; but one thing I am now a huge fan; is the homemade jams.  The biscuit with the homemade jam, my new craving!!!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of bummed about this place. My friend who brought me had nothing but good things to say until now. We walked in and waited 5 minutes to be seated, which is fine.. But then a group comes in after us and gets seated. We get seated and for 20 minutes are ignored by the staff. Finally we decide to leave to another place. I asked to speak with the manager and waited 5 mins before I decide I needed to eat. Sucks too because so many people say the food is great."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. Couldn't wait to try it, but sadly, I can wait on returning. The food, was just ok. The service could use some help. Only open from 7am to 3pm, offering breakfast and lunch. One would assume, they have some skills making traditional breakfast fair. We ordered eggs over easy with bacon, and hash browns and some pancakes. The eggs were barely runny, almost lukewarm. The pancakes were just ok. I totally would have sent back the eggs, however our waitress never came back after dropping the food. Never made another appearance, much less to ask how everything was, or to refill our waters. We actually ordered milk, but it was never delivered. It's disappointing when the meal goes bad, and the service isn't there to make up for it. I tried to catch a server, any server to at least get our bill. Ok so, I would understand if the restaurant was busy, and our server was zipping around working her butt off...but no that wasn't the case. I had to get up and walk over to the first employee I saw, and request our bill. By this time, I had almost forgot what she looked like haha. Finally! She makes an appearance to drop off the check. Unfortunately, the bill had the 2 glaases of milk we never received on it. By this time we just wanted to leave our cash on the table, and go.But instead had to make another trip to find the server on the way to the register. At last, I am up at the register getting the bill straightened out....and finally she inquiries about our meal!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Joe's Diner.  The service is great and the food is addicting.  Love the biscuits and gravy, and the pancakes are exceptional.  The staff is delightful.  This is a regular weekend stop for us."}
{"text":"So driving along 16th Street going north towards camelback, it's interesting that I've passed by Joes countless of times not realizing it's a diner. ho hum, you learn something new everyday especially in Phoenix. lol. Anywho, went to breakfast with my friend Sara V. and was lucky to get a parking spot. We went there at around 10, and were seated promptly, I'm guessing this place is not the best spot for groups larger than 4 since most of the diner is made up of booths, didn't see many free standing tables. 

So the menu isn't large, it has its basics, omelettes, sandwiches, pancakes, a few combo generics like pork loin and eggs, chicken fried steak and eggs, corn beef hash and so forth. I got myself the chicken fried steak with eggs (over medium) and a short stack of pancakes. Also, got an apple juice and I should have asked if it was the actual juice and not the cider, it was the cider and altho it's not my fave, i drank it. The service wasn't slow at all, the staff was busy yet friendly, we even had Joe in his chef pants (I didn't know they were chef pants until Sara V. told me they were, I thought the pattern and fabric looked weird) ask how we were. *nice touch* It's great that Joe connects with his customers. =) (okay that's a star!)

Anyways the food came, and the chicken fried steak was alright not the best, and yes, I've had better, and the potatoes with the plate were alright but for two stars alone are the pancakes. YUMMMMMMMMMMM! they're crispy, and so freaking good with the butter and syrup... delish! I'll come back to Joes for the pancakes coz that's where the money's at. Overall good service - a star, delicious pancakes - two stars and Joe connecting with his customers, another star = 4 stars. Chances of me coming back, soon I hope, I'm craving a stack! extra butter please! =)"}
{"text":"Disgusting sums it all up. I was looking for a  place to have lunch that was not fast food. I gave this place a try and regretted it. Ordered the meatloaf and it was barely warm and the gravy was cold and like jello! Two little thinly slices of meatloaf and nasty mash potatoes. I picked at it for a few minutes and pushed the plate away not even attempting to try the vegetables. The check was given to me before I even took my first bite. 

$12 for this garbage? No way Jose this place sucks!"}
{"text":"Don't underestimate this place by it's looks.
This colorful restaurant is all heart by a couple who wanted good local food.
The biscuits are so light and fluffy......like a dream. You MUST eat at least two: one with butter and local honey and one with butter and owners freshly made cherry preserves. The pancakes are the BEST in the valley; (yes, even better than Matt's & Butter). So run, don't walk and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awful experience, immediately seated which was probably the best part of the experience.  Waitress took our order, but never actually placed it. Waited 45min for our food, owner didn't seem to care, never got one apology. Super disappointed will never return."}
{"text":"I used to go to 5 & Diner up the street from Joe's Diner before I heard about this place all the time. But now that I know this place is here, I would much rather come here to support a mom-and-pop shop that serves basically the same food.

I've only ever eaten breakfast at this place, but every time I do it's never disappointing. 

I ate here a few days ago with my wife and her family that came into town. I had the Denver omelette which was a little over-cooked, but was still good. 

The last time I came here, I had the pancakes which were seriously very good. But because I'm trying to cut flour out of my diet, I didn't have them this time. Instead, I looked longingly at my wife's cousin's piece that went largely uneaten. (He's a kiddo). 

The service was quick and our server was friendly and helpful. 

I think this place needs a huge sign to show that they're here, because if you're not looking for it, you could easily pass it. It's also right next to some motorcycle shop. The outside is really nothing to look at, but once you're inside, you'll know you're in a diner. 

It's a little dark inside, but that's okay. The red booths are reminiscent of the 5 & Diner up the street. 

The only drawback to this place is the hours of business. It's open 7am-3pm. Diners need to be open 24/7! 

If they polished up the exterior and made their presence known, they'd probably have more people in too. The last few times I've been, there weren't too many people. 

Good find though!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of things to like about Joe's.
The food is fresh and tasty.
Prices are quite reasonable.
The coffee ROCKS!
The diner/greasy spoon vibe is comfortable.
The servers are fast, friendly and competent.
And I can walk there from my house!

Now - if I could just get a better appreciation for breakfast. (Haven't tried the lunches yet...)"}
{"text":"Always love an honest to god good diner!  Nothing fancy here.  But the food is yummy.  Try the biscuits and gravy.  MMMMMMM.  And the service was friendly and competent.  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love the belgium waffle! Owners are very friendly. My girlfriend and I come here a lot because of location to our house, and it's an easy, no fuss place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"It was ok. Food was average and service was ok. Will go back sometime but won't make a special trip like I did the other day to try it."}
{"text":"Huge pancakes, crispy and chewy toast, and the breakfast bowl is amazing. I love the atmosphere and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"First time trying Joe's for Sunday breakfast. Seemed a bit chaotic and unorganized at the register to put your name in.  There were 4 in our party we ordered.

1) #2 Two eggs* with two sausage patties, two bacon strips
& a short stack of pancakes - (Eggs cooked well, bacon & sausage patties warm but need to cook bit longer, pancakes tasted good more like a flap jack)

1) Breakfast burrito - Made of three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, Cheddar cheese & a side of sour cream & salsa - (Lots of flavor and filling)

2) Eggs Benedict - Hollandaise sauce tops two poached eggs on Canadian bacon sitting on crisp english muffins - (Great taste eggs done well, hollandaise nice flavor but needed to be more on the plate, canadian bacon and muffins both needed to be cook/toasted longer)

Over all not bad for a first try. Worth giving it a second shot we all have bad days."}
{"text":"Joes offers friendly service and a classic diner menu consisting of burgers, sandwiches, meatloaf and breakfast items. They are open for breakfast and lunch.

The place is a bit dated and the silverware is bent but it's comfortable. It's much bigger on the inside than it appears and there are plenty of booths and large tables if you are going with a group. I love breakfast food morning, noon and night but for some reason I passed over that large portion of the menu and ordered a sandwich. I had the Rachel which was turkey, coleslaw and thousand island on marbled rye. It came with a side of crispy fries. The sandwich was just ok. The coleslaw on it seemed a bit off so I scraped most of it off. My friend had the hot roast beef sandwich which came smothered in gravy with mashed potatoes. We also shared a slice of hot apple pie."}
{"text":"A Master Chef and food historian brought me to Joe's Diner. I've been coming back ever since. The decor is classic American diner but the food and coffee is a cut above. $10 sandwiches are done perfectly. The coffee is Arbuckles Ariosa cowboy coffee. The waitress was very nice. Nice little mid town jem in the Melrose District"}
{"text":"I saw this place on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try. The waitress was less than friendly.  We both ordered pancakes and eggs. The food came out promptly, but our eggs were cold and our pancakes were almost burnt. They were so crispy on the outside that we even decided to send them back. When we asked the waitress to take the pancakes back because they were too overcooked, she said she would see if the cook would take them back. When she came back to our table she told us that the cook stated that she could not cook them any differently than they were presented to us. She asked if we'd like to keep the pancakes!  Unbelievable! So we had to either accept the pancakes or order something else. I ordered the cinnamon roll and it was okay. Overall we were not satisfied with the service and the food was not tasty or hot or cooked the way we would have liked it to be cooked.  I do not recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"BEST PANCAKES EVER!! 
This diner was such a treat! Everyone there was friendly and sassy! The pancakes were amazing, the house potatoes were perfectly seasoned! Veggie omelet was delicious! Even the coffee was good! 

I found it by chance when an out of town guest was looking for a brunch spot on Saturday. So glad he found this place! I've been craving it again ever since! 
The food, the atmosphere, everything was just what you'd expect at a diner! I want to become a regular!"}
{"text":"Overall it's a pretty nice place. Good food and very nice people. It's a very positive environment and family friendly. I would give it a higher rating...but I can't get past the coffee. It seems a bit watered down. I really enjoy coffee with breakfast so it's hard for me to get around.

Otherwise, good food and good people. Much attention is paid to the customer and they do care that people leave satisfied. For lunch I would especially recommend their burgers. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Okay I used to love this place when they were located on 16th street, so what happened?  The new \"diner\" looks more like a closed down Asian restaurant than diner.  When they moved locations they lost the diner atmosphere and luster.  Not only that but the food isn't the same, seems that maybe some recipes have changed.  I work at a restaurant, over by the old location, and used to tell people, who wanted breakfast, to go to joes and enjoy some awesome biscuits and gravy.  Sad to say I can no longer refer people over there."}
{"text":"I recently moved in across the street from Joe's, and have been walking over every Saturday morning. I get the border omelet and potatoes everytime, so I can't speak for anything else on the menu, but it's good for what it is. Joe usually stops by the tables and talks to everyone which I really like. The guy knows how to run a business. Coffee is good too."}
{"text":"BEST PANCAKES ANYWHERE! Ill take their pancakes over IHOP, Dennys, Cracker Barrell, anyplace. Family owned, the owners Joe and Joann are amazing. Very family friendly, good people, and recognize all their regulars. They are always working, and are committed to their diner. Great portions of food, and again....THE PANCAKES. Give it a try if you're in uptown PHX one of these days."}
{"text":"As far as breakfast is concerned, this place deserves 5 stars! Joe's Diner is a classic diner through and through. The decor is made up of old gas station signage and shiny diner furniture...it has a great feel to it.

I ordered the number 2 which is basically like a sampler (think Denny's grand slam). It had bacon, sausage, eggs and a couple of pancakes to round it all off. It was everything I hoped it would be, the bacon was thick and cooked perfectly, and the pancakes, though not very fluffed up, had a perfect classic pancake flavor. All of that for about what Denny's charges at $6. I also got to try some of a bacon and american cheese omelette, along with a homemade biscuit with chorizo sausage gravy! Oh, yeah.... chorizo sausage gravy! If you like sausage gravy, give the chorizo gravy a try. It isn't on the menu so make sure to ask for it specifically.

I'm already anticipating the next time I can dine at Joe's. I had a fantastic experience, and I really hope this place gets busy as hell! And, one last thing...not only was the food and service more than I expected, but Joe himself came to my table and shook my hand. He's a really cool guy that definitely takes a lot of pride in his diner."}
{"text":"Wow - what a delightful visit!   The chorizo Biscuits and gravy was awesome,  we all really believe that the buttermilk pancakes were sincerely the BEST we have all ever had.    Read that last sentence again!    No kidding.   Cinnamon role was awesome too.   Service outstanding.    Our server Denise was so fun and warm.    Joe himself you could tell was hovering around ensuring that every single client had an outstanding experience.    Daughter really enjoyed chicken sandwich.    Pretty cool to give such a review when they had been in new building for only 3 days and even blowing circuit breakers (they were pretty busy).    FYI - it is on 7th AVENUE not 7th street!"}
{"text":"Tried Joes today for the first time, even tho we've lived less than a mile away for almost 2 yrs. We are so sad we waited this long to find this jewel! Sunday mid morning and only waited about 5 min. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Delicious from scratch biscuits! And the pancakes.... Ooohhhh the pancakes!! *pause to wipe away drool* BEST pancakes ever!!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Been here once before. Great traditional breakfast/lunch diner. The pancakes are fantastic, the service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My bf and I wanted to try something new for breakfast one morning and decided to give Joe's Diner a try.  The inside is pretty cool, it is like an old style diner.  The people are super nice and seated us right away.

The menu is pretty basic but everything comes with your choice of biscuit or toast.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with chorizo and it was just ok.  The flavor was decent but nothing really to write home about.  I always try chorizo at non-mexican food places and I am almost always disappointed!  I also never got my biscuit which I was really wanting to try.

I may go back there just for the atmosphere and the nice people but it isnt one of my favorite breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Great food, coffee, AND service! Every time I visit Phoenix I just have to visit Joe's Diner. I just love this place! The potatoes, pancakes and coffee are superb!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Service was quick, friendly and efficient as breakfast/lunch places should be. They did not disappoint in that aspect. I ordered the scramble, meat lovers and it was more than enough for one person! I probably could have split it with someone; I did end up taking half home. Mine was a little dry so I asked for a side of sour cream. 
My sister ordered two eggs, potatoes and toast-hers was a little greasy for her liking so she soaked up some of the grease with napkins. Jason ordered the chorizo omelet, very tasty!  Good flavor. 

One nice touch, the owner came around to every table and made people feel welcome and asked how their meals were."}
{"text":"2/3 stars the service was very good my wife had the eggs bene which she really like it came w/ a side of fruit.......no potatoes she also asked for eggs poached soft the wait gal said THATS THE WAY THEY ALWAYS COME......NOT i had the corn beef hash some yelper said it was great .....hey my friend its out of a can ..it was ok  came with 3 eggs  and a bisquit w chorizo gravy suprising enough it was bland. GREAT eclectic crowd including 3 of phx's finest ....all set in a 50's diner setting .zzzzzzzzzzzzz sorry joes probley wont be back ...."}
{"text":"I love the homey feel of this place! The food is pretty dang good, I smother their chorizo gravy on everything and pancakes are always a good choice! Been my Friday tradition to eat here! Service is great as well! If you're searching for good food and a feel good diner stop by here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First time here, for breakfast.... Was thinking to find something else besides IHOP & Denny's ..... Obviously this place need to call Robert Irvine! Smell old , look old , oily everything you touch .... I have a chance to try anyway because of \" good yelp reviews\" MISTAKE!!!! Server was sooooo rude, she needs to be \"trained\" of customer service speak abilities ..... I bet they did not see much nice dressed up people. Ok, food.... Home made potatoes were good, omelet sooooo plain! Do they have at least black pepper? Ok, 1 star for potato...."}
{"text":"Can you say homemade Hollandaise sauce? Central Phoenix has some really really good breakfast spots but Joe's Diner is the best of all of them. I'm an early riser so I've never had to wait but often when we're leaving there is a small line. Then only is the food good the staff is excellent and the place is spotless. Definitely worth all 5 stars"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix this morning on business .Looked at yelp reviews and this place had favorable ones. Was seated promptly, and the waitress was very pleasant and prompt Bathroom was very clean, so enough of the pluses. Had ham and eggs, don't know why they call the potatoes spicy because along with the rest of my breakfast was tasteless. The water could use another run thru a filter, I did leave full but like most breakfast spots in phoenix I just kept thinking what a waste of money. I don't understand why for 11 dollars you don't get a real piece of ham instead of the spam like formed piece I received. They do offer a ham steak but its in the please don't substitute section. Just a total disappointment, I don't understand why you cant offer a fresh and favorable breakfast without charging 20 dollars"}
{"text":"We tried this place for breakfast this past weekend because we had heard about it from several people.  It was pretty good.  We only had to wait five minutes for a table on a Sunday morning, which was not bad at all. The service was great the entire time. Always had our water and coffee glasses full.  The food was just okay.  We had their Eggs Benedict, I was not a fan of the ham, but the rest was pretty good. Their breakfast burrito was alright, just too many potatoes, which made it really dry. Their biscuits were delicious, but the chorizo gravy was just okay."}
{"text":"So let me explain my 3 star!!!!  My daughter talked us into going her for her birthday breakfast because the biscuits and gravy was supposed to be the best!!!! Mmmmmmmmmm I was totally lied too by my own child!!! It was so so.. at best... biscuits were not fluffy nor fresh and the to die to sausage gravy needs to be rethought and redone. Also the omelette my wife ordered came with cheese when we spoke 2 times to waitress about NO CHEESE!! Somewhere this got lost I guess!!!  Coffee want Great either... I don't want to bag on this place anymore but surely this year I will spend time taking my daughter to bigger and better breakfast spots!!!!!"}
{"text":"food is awesome and best pancakes in phoenix.   just returned home after paying for a short stack to go.   arrived 20 minutes after i place my order.  paid my bill.  waited another 10 minutes.   waitress asked if i wanted to be seated"}
{"text":"Simply the best. Can't find better service or breakfast in the valley. Always a pleasure to dine here. Yes, it is a basic simple breakfast but it taste like quality at half the price. This is one spot where the whole family can eat out and not break the bank. I'm stuffed and full with money still in my pockets. 

I highly recommend if you like fresh, warm pancakes you will love Joe's. Trust the true pancake critic."}
{"text":"Have driven past this little diner for the longest time, and finally my friend convinced me to try it for breakfast. She had the vegetarian omelet and I had the chorizo omelet. Both were very tasty and the potatoes that come with it are cooked to perfection and very well seasoned. I substituted my toast for a pancake and was happy I did. The pancakes are delicious!!! You must try their pancakes if you're going to stop by. My friend got the toast which was a lot of bread!! They have certain jelly that is like no other, gotta have that with your toast. Overall, this is a great place to get a quick bite to eat and enjoy some good ol' fashion diner food."}
{"text":"If you want house made , high quality locally sourced ingredients in a coffee shop without the snooty prices come to Joe's Diner on 7th Ave. for breakfast and lunch.   You will definitely meet the owners Joe and Deb who are gracious and charming.   

But back to the food:   The best pancakes and buttermilk biscuits EVER.   Omelets and eggs made perfectly .   House made jams and good strong coffee roasted from Tucson.   Fantastic sandwiches and salads all fresh and tasting of thoughtful and expert preparation.    Wonderful coffee shop!!!!!"}
{"text":"I know a good pancake when I try one since pancakes are one of my favorite foods to eat. This is the one food item I can eat for dinner and be happy. Well Joes Diner which is only open for breakfast and lunch has been added to one of my top pancake places to eat. The nifty 50's diner fresh food appeal makes 5 & Diner look bad. Joe's diner not only makes fresh quality tasting pancakes this place has some of the best pricing in town. To top it off best customer service I have seen at any breakfast joint in a while. I did not expect my $2.99 short stack to taste as good as it did. My mouth is watering as I type this that is how good Joe's pancakes are. Intrigued by the pricing I also ordered breakfast potatoes, bacon, and some orange juice. Everything was just grrrrrreeeeaaaat! I had been driving by this place for months now and finally had an opportunity to try the food. I am glad I stopped in because I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Best found local greasy spoon! We always end up at Joe's! Huge portions of good food. The chorizo sausage gravy is craveable. I get it as a side to just eggs! Never had bad service. I love how the owner will come by and check on you. And he hired folks with developmental disabilities and that warms my heart! Giving back!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!!!! Fresh good food!!!!!!! Best Corned Beef Hash!!!!!! Great service! Friendly staff!!!!!!! I just do  not know what these people are talking about. I live in the neighborhood and love this place."}
{"text":"I never went to the old location, I really hope it was better than this. I went here on a Sunday afternoon and there was more staff the customers. Which is why I was perplexed when it took 5 mins for me just for attention at the counter. I order coffee and a number 2. The food was good but being from the Midwest I don't understand the hype. During my meal I was never asked how was it nor was my coffee refilled. After I was done eating it took another 10 mins for someone ( not my waitress) to clear my plate. It was another 5 mins I had to wave someone down to get my bill. I was given the wrong bill and told the lady its not mine and was promptly asked if I was sure. WTH!? Yes I know what I ate. She just said just pulled up my seat in the computer and that's what is was. I told her what I had and she went and got the correct one. I live in the neighborhood and like having them close by, but I will hold off another visit till the service is better."}
{"text":"Joe's Diner is delicious with wonderful people. I love the All-American vibe, and I appreciate the friendly, down-to-earth staff. The only downside for the diner is THEY DON'T SERVE hash browns."}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by its cover. Inside, this diner is a full 100. The food is well-priced & the service is friendly. We were welcomed as family on our first visit ever. Most importantly, the food was great."}
{"text":"I think we caught the waiting staff on an off day. They didn't seem very organized and were slow to assist. But they were friendly.

The food is ok and that is it. If you looking for the greatest breakfast joint in the world this is not it.  If you want decent food at a good price without flare then this is a good place to try. 

The biscuits were really good as well as the coffee. I didn't care for the was they mixed the sausage into my eggs though. 

The owner came out to greet people and explained how he trys to buy all of his product locally which is always good to know. 

I won't go out of my way to come back but I will if I'm in the area.  I do recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Very nice people running the place.  That goes a long way.

The food was very tasty.  I had the pork chop with two sunny side up eggs and the home fries and wheat toast.

It's definitely above average.  I'd say better than most but a step below Matt's and Over Easy.

The place is all \"50's upped\" and pipes in Sirius 50's music.  Nice little decor setup, and it was clean.

Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Looking for the best breakfast in the Valley of the Sun, without having to cook it  ourselves - we found  \"Joe's Diner\"
We may never make breakfast again! 

Perfect poached eggs, crispy bacon and pancakes Henry Winkler tweeted as the best pancakes ever are here. 
There may be a line to be seated on weekends, be patient. 

\"Joe's Diner\" at 4515 N 7th. Avenue, Phx AZ 85013, everything you need to start the day:)"}
{"text":"This is pretty much a no-frills place. I guess at one time the theme of the '50's diner' was unexplored, but here we are in 2014, well past that point. The food was meh, too. Bacon was kind of flavorless and not worth the calories. Biscuit was kind of salty tasting. The pancakes were very good, though, and I'd go back and order them alone."}
{"text":"Busy on a Sunday morning, but totally worth the wait. Food was fantastic. Highly recommend the corned beef hash and the pancakes. Denver omelette with potatoes was a winner too. Lots of food, but we totally cleaned our plates because we couldn't stop eating!"}
{"text":"Excellent diner!   Fresh, delicious and reasonably priced food. I had the Number 2 breakfast and it's amazing.  Fluffy buttermilk pancakes and the best bacon ever!  

Friendly and efficient staff.  Even met the owner and she's a delight.  If I lived closer, would make this a weekly thing.  Seriously."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go there for breakfast. I'm so glad she did. Excellent food! Good prices and friendly staff. I chatted with the owners who also work there. Really fine people. 

I had the vegetable omelet, fresh \"farm style?\" potato's (nicely seasoned), homemade biscuit which was scrumptious and I chose water to drink. My friend swears awesome good things about the coffee. 

Consider me a happy regular."}
{"text":"After reading the menu we ordered one order of pancakes, one chorizo omelet, and one eggs benedict with biscuits and gravy all with coffee.  The coffee was delicious, fresh and hot.  The pancakes were really fluffy and tasty especially with the home made apple butter and jam.  The chorizo omelet was the best I have ever had and the biscuits were amazing!  Just the right side were the very delicious potatoes.  The benedict was a bit disappointing since it was canned hash but the biscuits and gravy made up for it.  Will we go back? Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"All their prices went up drastically and fast!
I also noticed after going a couple of times recently their portions are also smaller not that my appetite can take a lot but it still is something that caught my eye. It would have been better if they would have been fair."}
{"text":"Went to try it out yesterday morning.  The service was so-so.  It wasn't crowded, and it took awhile for me to be noticed (and I'm 6'2\", 275!)The Arbuckle's coffee was great.  Ordered the #2.....2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties and 2 strips of bacon for $5.99.  Everything was fine except the sausage which had a peculiar flavor....the bacon strips were thick and tasty, the eggs okay, and the cakes were very good with an interesting touch....instead of the normal one glob of butter on top of the two cakes, there was one on top and one between the two cakes (made for easy buttering of the bottom cake).  All in all worth another try (might have been just an off day for the sausage).  Wish it were closer to home!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes I ever had. I am not a pancake afficionado, but these are airy and fluffly without being dense and doughy. The chorizo gravy and biscuit waa better than expected; I am not a biscuit and gravy person but theae were good, pretty sure someone who enjoys it would find them fantastic. My all time fav, corn beed hash was nice and crispy   Their coffee is amazing, not bitter, no gimmicks, just a great cup of Joe.

Read many reviews complained about the price. Not sure what other people are looking to pay for good quality of food. If a chain restaurant is more of your liking, avoid this place, you may be dissapointed about their menu selections and great flavors. I'm from NY, and paying $8.75 for corn beed hash is actually a bargain. Can not put a price on good comfort food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good breakfast.  Reasonably priced - generous portions, a notch above the fray.  The service was also very attentive, our coffee never saw empty.

As everyone has already attested, the pancakes here are prolific.  Crispy bits that could only be created on a really hot griddle, fried with what I imagine to be some deliciously heart clogging fat - like bacon grease or Crisco (unconfirmed).  The corn beef hash was also excellent.

I'd bring a friend."}
{"text":"Man let me tell y'all something! I went here for the first time ever this morning and MY MY MY! This food here! This food right here! The cook has to be touched by God! The steak was so tender man cut through it like butter! The biscuits and gravy look don't get me started! The eggs were on point and the potatoes! YES GAWD! Man I'll be back that's for sure! Even the 7UP tasted like it came from a holy tap!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The restaurant is clean, the food is good and the staff was really friendly.  I was in Phoenix for an event and ate breakfast here three consecutive mornings.  It's basically just comfort food at good prices.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in ages, but this place is SO GOOD that I'd be ashamed of myself if I didn't review it.

I am the most hyberbolic person in the whole world in the history of time, but this time, when I say that it was the best pancakes I've ever had, I'm not kidding.  Just insanely delicious.  Scrambled eggs were also some of the best I've had (and come on, they're scrambled eggs, so you don't expect that much variety), and the breakfast potatoes were very good.  I couldn't pinpoint the seasoning, but it's different than you usually get.

Coffee:  Yum.  I don't think I'd even heard of Arbuckle's, but apparently it's got a great reputation, and deservedly so.

The owner Joe stopped by our table, and was super nice and genuine.  Service was just fine too.

I'm sure Joe's will get a reputation and huge following soon, so believe the hype and check it out."}
{"text":"I could eat here every morning and never get tired of the food. The pancakes are to die for! I've never tasted anything like them. Joe is always in the store and is so much fun to chat with. Support your local business's!!"}
{"text":"Weekend mornings I'm all about being a complete lazy bear, sleeping in then get up just long enough to lie back down on the couch. Only a few have the power to lure me out of bed and one of those is the promise of a big satisfying breakfast. Of course not by my own hand but by someone elses because lets face it, I'm that lazy on the weekends.

So when I decided to cover the much buzzed about Joe's Diner it was sheer excitement that got me out of bed. You know a plate full of perfectly cooked eggs and bacon paired lovingly with cups of hot coffee and glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice are true motivators.

As we saunter in we're welcomed by an upbeat good morning and sat pretty much immediately. Located in what used to be a classic car shop, husband and wife team Joan and Joe Seriale transport you back in time with 1950's nostalgia complete with glitter flecked seating and old tin billboards and neon signs. There's a flurry of waitresses and I kept waiting for Flo to appear with her huge red nest of hair but she never showed up.

Concerning breakfast there's always that one nagging question, should I go savory or sweet? I say do both starting out with one of Joe's homemade Cinnamon Rolls ($2.59). The large yeasty bun arrived laying in its own caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon pool, complete with an oozing topping of cream cheese frosting. I nearly stabbed my partner with my fork after he took the best part, the tender loved filled center. When I eat a cinnamon roll I like take my sweet time, licking and nibbling on the outside, making sure I don't miss an inch of that roll. Then once I get to the center I'm gratefully rewarded with a mouthful of gooey pleasure.

The Number Two ($6.49) is the more versatile choice when it comes to the sweet and savory dilemma. You get two eggs, your way, two sausage patties, two bacon strips and a short stack of fluffy pancakes. This plate has your bases covered with the addition of thick ropes of maple syrup which the pancakes gladly guzzle down. For an alternative try the strawberry jam in lieu of the syrup, some rules were meant to be broken.

Joe's Homemade Biscuits & Gravy ($2.99) gets you a plate full of light-as-air biscuits grounded by a layer of sausage gravy. The gravy had a faint sweetness that was a surprise hit at our table.

If you're having a rough morning from one-to-many last night, try this remedy, Joe's Breakfast Burrito ($6.59). Stuffed tight into a soft flour tortilla are three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and cheddar cheese served with a sides of sour cream and salsa. Or try the Breakfast Bowl ($7.59) which gets you scrambled eggs with ham, bacon and cheddar cheese served over home style potatoes. Both were filling and satisfying, the only thing was a couch afterwards to nap on.

I foresee Joe's Diner getting me out of bed many more times in the near future, especially after dreaming about cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"Sunday eggs Benedict special is a wow. Heavy tasty great sauce over hefty ham and best English muffin I've had in some time. With red potatoes more than I could eat.  This place is not cheap but does not skimp on quality. Great diner.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's the breakfast potatoes! They'll hook you with the breakfast potatoes. 

Beyond that, the family-style hospitality and consistent performance in the kitchen have secured Joe's a spot on our \"where should we go for breakfast?\" response card."}
{"text":"If my service wasn't so horrible, I would probably give them 3 stars. The ambiance/theme is cute, though there's an opportunity to cheese it up even more and integrate it in more areas. I had a Monte Cristo, which was OK and a bite of my breakfast companion's pancakes, which were good. It took forever to get acknowledged once seated and our bill literally never came, we wound up walking up front and asking to close out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. Their corned beef hash is the best!  Not a huge fan of the omelette but that's ok. The hash is always my go to :)"}
{"text":"You can eat breakfast for breakfast. You can eat breakfast for lunch. You can eat breakfast in between and call it brunch. Regardless of when you eat it, I would suggest you eat it at Joe's diner!  They may have moved locations, but you still can't beat their breakfast sandwich!

I have never had anything that I could say was bad at Joe's.  I once said that I could close my eyes and point at the menu and end up with something yummy.  I am still pretty sure that holds true.

Portions are large and probably not the healthiest but if you are going to splurge on breakfast, you might as well have one of their fabulous buttermilk pancakes, or biscuits and gravy (which you can have with spicy chorizo if you choose), or one of their combos, or that breakfast sandwich that I literally dream of...  like I said close your eyes and point.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You can eat breakfast for breakfast. You can eat breakfast for lunch. You can eat breakfast in between and call it brunch. Regardless of when you eat it, I would suggest you eat it at Joe's diner!

Based on my recent meal here I would rate this somewhere closer to a 4.5 and tipping toward solid red stars. We arrived around one and received a very friendly greeting. I thought at the time it had been a long time since I received a genuinely warm hello simply upon entering. There was only one table occupied and in front of the gentleman was quite a fastastic looking array of food.

My friend and I both had more difficulty limiting our choices, than finding something that sounded off limits. Literally we probably could have closed our eyes and pointed and been happy.

BFF ordered one of the combo plates that came with eggs, biscuits and gravy, and a ginormous peice of grilled ham. I opted for the hash topped with fried eggs and my very own B&G. We both were wanted the full carb experience, as we are gearing up for a restrictive diet, so we opted to split a single cake at the very wise suggestion of the hostess/server/friendly hello giver/joe's wife. As the food arrives we dig in and all conversation ceases... well unless you count the intermittent \"mmmm\" and \"ahhhh\". Each item was better than the last. The hash was standard diner fare, but it was grilled until it was toasty brown, which set it apart. The eggs were prepared perfectly as defined by their handy menu guide alerting customers to their standards (soft wiggly vs. done with a slightly soft center). The B&Gs were uber good. The gravy is chock full of flavor, without being overly so and the biscuit held up to its liquid mate, which meant you could actually eat it without it becoming a gummy mess.  But the pancake. Oh the pancake. It was the star of the meal. It was fluffy and moist, topped with a beautiful blob of butter that actually was enough to cover the massive cake.

As others came in, it became very clear that coming to Joe's is like coming home for many people. Faces and names were recognized. Hugs were doled out, etc. Maybe someday I will be able to make it over to the lunch side of the menu, but for now Joe's Diner is moving in the to regular rotation for breakfast. For it's comfortable vibe, friendly family owned environment, and off the chart diner food - you will love it too!"}
{"text":"Dark, gloomy, saw the floor and it looked like it hasn't seen a mop for weeks

Got there around 11:30am and there were tables available but the cashier/host was to busy to swap from one job to another

Just went to postinos on central

Clean and they know what there doing"}
{"text":"Classic diner. Owner/chef Joe is a real pro. Excellent flavors. Try his gravy. Bacon nice and thick and always cooked right. Simple food done right. Cheerful staff rounds out solid breakfast. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place was clean, the service was wonderful and the food (we were there for lunch) was fantastic! The portions are large and the sweet potato chips were light and crispy.

5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while we were visiting Phoenix and the yelp community came through again in choosing a good place to eat.  The Chorizo gray is awesome!  I had a breakfast skillet with potatoes, egg and sausage and gravy on the side.  Delicious :)"}
{"text":"Finally an official \"go to\" diner for breakfast in Phoenix, without all of the added hype wait times and over~inflated~self~indulging hoopla that some of the \"more famous\" breakfast places have had from being featured on TV's food network!  Joe's Diner is the real deal, cooking tasty homemade breakfast the way it should be.

First thing I noticed is this place is ten times the size of the other two \"more famous\" breakfast diners with plenty of room to move around with little wait times even when they are busy. It's easy in and easy out! 

Second thing I noticed was the service. It was fantastic and memorable! In fact it was THE BEST service we've experienced in any diner throughout all of Phoenix.  Even Joe gets involved cleaning tables, meeting his customers, shaking hands and asking for feedback on what he can do better to make your dining experience even better.  Dolores G mention he brought out some black eyed peas during her visit for good luck in the New Year. During our visit Joe brought out some samples of his candied toffee that was not on the menu for us to sample. It was toffee deliciousness that I've never experienced before. This owner is FANTASTIC with his customers!

The third and final thing I noticed was their food tasted exceptional. Everything was cooked and seasoned very well. We ordered almost a sample of everything from pancakes with eggs, bacon and has browns to corn beef hash with eggs on top with a side of biscuits and gravy. We also had their Sunday special of eggs Benedict with a side of sausage.  Everything was awesome. Their homemade pancakes were light and had just enough flavor without being too doughy. Their scratch biscuits and gravy were \"the bomb\"! You can eat just the biscuit by it's self, it has that much flavor. Their sausage was exceptional with the right amount of spices and fat ratio. Their coffee was very smooth and tasty. They use Arbuckles, made in Tucson. We bought a bag to bring home!

My only criticism was even though their corn beef hash and bacon tasted very good they weren't homemade at their diner, for everything else was.  Joe thanked me for my feedback and stated he has been working on making these in house with some trial and error. This is why this place deserves a 5 star rating, hand down. 

Joe and his staff will make your visit enjoyable, appetite fulfilling and well worth your time and money. I've been to the other two so called \"more famous\" breakfast diners many times and I have never met theirs owners nor have received service even close to this. 

Look out Phoenix and those two so called \"more famous\" diners!!  Joe's Diner will win you over as they have with me.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to try something Joe has either on or off his menu!"}
{"text":"The move may have improved the experience.  Food was like home cooking and service was very good.  

Ordered the wrap and it was enough for two meals, very generous on portions."}
{"text":"We were here for breakfast. I had Number One - ham, eggs, biscuits with sausage gravy (I opted for chorizo gravy). All tasted great. Service was good, fast. Atmosphere good in a family diner style."}
{"text":"We live just down the street from Joe's and knew nothing of the old location when we finally saw work being done to the old chinese buffet building. And then one morning it was just open and the place was packed with cars! It seems Joe's has some very loyal regulars. Happy to have a breakfast place within walking distance as the weather has gotten nice, we've been to Joe's a handful of times. Service has always been good, the food has always been decent, and the cars are always lined up every weekend. Welcome to the neighborhood, Joe's!"}
{"text":"Yum. Seriously yum. 

I still kind of feel guilty about this massive breakfast I ate, but... I'll get over it. 

The pancakes are the star. As many people have pointed out. They're fluffy and have great flavor, and they're dripping with butter. Heaven. 

I had a plate with two pancakes, two sausage patties, two strips of thick and delicious bacon and two eggs over easy. Ridiculous. 

Joe himself even came around to see how things were. 

One star off for the kind of runny, undercooked eggs. Here's a solution to that problem, skip the stupid eggs next time and stick to what's good... Pancakes."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person. It takes a lot to get my lazy ass out of bed so breakfast never was my thing. Joe's is one of those dining experiences that is an exception to that rule. The bacon and sausage are hearty, they know how to poach an egg and their coffee is great-really a rarity for a breakfast and lunch place.
Everyone who works there is friendly and cheerful and the owner himself asked how my meal was.This is another place that I would encourage all Yelpers to go patronize because they serve up great food with a smile and a lot of heart and are more than worthy of our hard earned dollars. Definitely worth getting out of bed early for."}
{"text":"Owned by a gal that I went to HighSchool with North High. Met up with three other people from school for breakfast. My first time here the food was very good egg cooked perfect chorizo gravy over biscuits yum yum it was very good"}
{"text":"They are super busy because their food is great. Had a veggie omelet  and coffee roasted in AZ. This is my Sunday breakfast favorite."}
{"text":"My friend and I had breakfast here recently. I had pancakes and sausage. He had a Denver omelet. Service was fast and our coffee was regularly topped off. It's the kind of place you feel comfortable hanging out and chatting even after your meal is done. It was good diner fare food in a welcoming environment. There was a little jar of jam on the table and at first I was excited that it might be blackberry (but it wasn't), but it was still good. I felt very welcome and cozy here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this diner. The menu said all the right things but the food was average. The server was great but the hostess was disinterested in us. We had the monte Cristo and the pork fritter sandwich (I think that was the name of it). What would have made the food live up to its menu description is a little bit of seasoning! Don't be afraid of salt! Especially on fried foods, a light sprinkle of salt goes a long way."}
{"text":"Really? I have been here twice. Never was greeted by anyone. When we sat ourselves we were walked by from the crew without any acknowledgement. When we finally got our food from a very limited breakfast menu, the chicken fried steak was tough. Of course no one asked if things were ok. Now to be fair I will eat just about anything, once.But early in the morning I like a friendly atmosphere and some variety for my breakfast. I will stick with the Melrose Diner up the street."}
{"text":"When I first went here at the old location it's was definitely 5 stars. Now that it has moved its different now, don't know why. Just some constructive criticism....the pancakes needs to be cooked on a griddle only for pancakes. They tasted like burnt oil with griddle burnt specs and pieces on them. They used to have a vanilla or maple flavor don't know what has changed. Also the chorizo biscuits had a sour taste to them don't know if that is a part of the recipe? They are always fast and friendly here so great fast breakfast on my day off. :) Enjoyed my alone time there today."}
{"text":"Great local place.  Great for a fast breakfast/lunch or a relaxing one.  The pancakes are stellar.  They're even better than Original Pancake House.  Seriously.  They're made from scratch and always perfect.  Very good prices for perfect portions."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food, great prices too on biscuits and gravy, pancakes, french toast. Yum! We come every year we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been to Joe's twice now and I certainly plan to return.  The chorizo biscuits and gravy is addictive.  The diner feel is authentic and service is excellent. It is clear that Joe and his wife are in the right field as they have truly created something special.  I want to try something else on the wonderful breakfast menu but cant get past the biscuits and gravy, the chorizo is unique and delicious.  Looking forward to hitting them up for lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly people and inexpensive good breakfast food"}
{"text":"I give Joes a two star only because I'm not crazy about the service. The elders in my family love joes. As do I for their food, which is consistently very delicious. However, every time I come in the wait time to be seated is a little long (that's important because I always have seniors with me). One visit we were told to seat ourselves and after five minutes asked to move because the section we sat in by the entrance was closed. The atmosphere is classic American comfort, yet the staff does not match the setting. It makes for a bit of a tense and uncomfortable mood. I know it could be overworked staff or low pay so I tend to give restaurant employees the benefit of the doubt. I will continue to come to joes but if the service stays the same I will convince my family it's time to choose a new diner"}
{"text":"First Impression: The owner greets you at the door and welcomes you into the restaurant, which is a nice touch. The location isn't the best but that's typically where you find the best restaurants. 

The food was delicious. The pancakes are yummy! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to Saturday morning breakfast joint.  We were regular diners almost every Saturday for over a year. The food was good and the service was fast. The service was not always the friendliest but that just depended upon who served you.  There was one particular server that was always quite unfriendly (we later discovered that this unfriendly server was one of the owners - Joe's wife) but everyone else was friendly and efficient.

One Saturday morning it all changed.  My husband ordered his usual sausage and eggs, eggs over-medium.  When the server asked how our meal was he was honest and said that it wasn't as good as it usually was.  The eggs were a little under-cooked.  The server told one of the owners (Joe's wife) that we were unhappy with our food and my husband repeated that it was okay but the eggs just were a little under-cooked and that it was unusual for us to have food we didn't like (since we had been eating there almost every Saturday for over a year).  The owner's response was atrocious!

She said the eggs are cooked exactly the way they are supposed to be and suggested that we should read the menu so we know how to order correctly.  My husband patiently explained to her that he always orders his eggs the same way and usually the food tastes great so he thought maybe there was a new cook. She didn't want to hear any of it.  She never even apologized!  She was extremely rude and maintained that he just didn't know how to order his food correctly.  I couldn't believe she was so rude to customers, especially regular ones. But she is so oblivious that she didn't even recognize that we had set foot in her restaurant before.

We will NEVER eat here again. We refuse to support a business with such rude ownership."}
{"text":"Though a bit crowded on the weekends, this is a great breakfast spot. And they also serve their own version of a Buffalo-area speciality called \"Beef on Weck\" on the lunch menu which my Western NY boyfriend says is quite authentic. In fact, according to him, the substitution of the Kosher salt and caraway seed Brioche roll for the traditional Kaiser roll the dish is usually served with makes it even better. An added bonus is the strange and kitchy garage next door (which can be seen thru a viewing window inside the restaurant). Not sure the history behind the Native American mannequin but it adds to the appeal of this great independent eatery."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after hiking Camelback Mountain. We were hungry and wanted some hearty diner food and totally found it in Joe's.

Two eggs poached for me. Perfect, especially for $0.99. My husband had the corned beef hash covered in two fried eggs with a side of chorizo gravy and biscuts. The hash was as he puts it so well: \"Tastes like it's out of a can, just like I like it.\" The eggs were cooked well. The only negative was the biscuit. Like good southerners, we're a little picky and it was a little doughy for our taste. But the chorizo gravy is a must. Delicious, and I know my gravy.

The service is friendly, quick, and attentive. We'd definitely come back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Smelled like cat urine, sad/unfriendly waitresses whom acted like I was inconveniencing them by eating there, and a hair in my food the second she set it down I noticed the hair and the waitress actually took my fork and proceeded to attempt to pick the hair off my egg. Disturbing. Not updated and slightly pricy for the below par food. Good coffee doe."}
{"text":"I had noticed this place a few times at it's old location and thought it was in an odd location. I drove by the current location and didn't realize it was the same restaurant until I looked it up online. The location is a much better one than the old one however they still have quite a bit to work on if they are going to make it over the long term. The Owner/Manager was waiting on tables and there seemed to be no managing of the restaurant. People were waiting to be seated or to cash out and no one seemed to be in charge just who ever was free. They seemed to have enough help, just poorly managed. The workers were all friendly and once we were seated we received prompt service. I noticed the Biscuits and Chorizo gravy and decided on the \"Number 1\" as they were included. My partner chose the Chicken Fried Steak which was covered with Sausage Gravy. The Chorizo Gravy had an ok flavor but the Sausage Gravy was much better. I was told that you could choose either and I would go with the Sausage if I ordered them again. Also, I thought the Chicken Fried Steak was a much better value as it came with Homefries, eggs and a biscuit for just a bit more. I noticed some other reviewers commented that the Ice Tea was not great. I ordered it knowing this and I agree. It was very weak and had an off taste. The Coffee was very good though. I understand the menu is limited (as are the hours) but maybe they will work through their Management issues and can expand both their hours and menu as I would love to see them make it and they have most of the parts to make a successful go. I will certainly be back as the Country Fried Steak was very tasty and overall it is a good value. I suggest giving it a try and read your fellow Yelper's tips as many were spot on."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The food and service was great. Friendly atmosphere and the owners are just awesome and sociable. The biscuits and gravy, French toast, corn beef hash, and sandwiches are yummy.  We were passing through from Texas to California - the biscuits and gravy meets every southern expectation. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Real Men Don't Eat Quiche.(1)  So fine, I'll just turn in my man card for a month.  Only served on Saturdays and the ingredients change according to availability.  This generous portion of quiche in bacon spinach form was enjoyed by 3 of the 6 people at our table.  It came with a bowl of diced melons.  Not to say it is the only good thing to eat here as everything ordered at the table disappeared quickly from our plates.  Including a shared stack of pancakes of which I had one.  But the quiche alone is enough reason to get there on a Saturday.

This was my first time at the new digs.  The small parking lot is saved by having street parking along the canal.  There are more tables here but on this Saturday late morning there was never more than a couple of empty tables at any given time.  With the layout large groups have to be broken up.  Service was spot on.  And the owner was visible in the dining room most of the time helping out where needed.

{"text":"Went here for a Saturday Smunch.  They were packed but the service was still great.  As things slowed down about noon the owner came out and made the rounds of his guests.  I had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, potatoes, skipped the toast and added a short stack of pancakes.  Way too much food for me but it was all good, very seldom do I get pancakes that are not doughy and overly filling (including my own kitchen), I really liked these."}
{"text":"I love pancakes but really hate trying to make them at home.  With Joe's just a short bike ride up the road from me I'm probably going to forgo ever attempting on my own again. The pancakes are so good and even better as part of the #2 menu item.  Two pancakes, bacon, sausage and eggs prepped your way. It's a big tasty meal! 
 My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and said he really liked them.  I think I've just discovered I really do not like country gravy. On the other hand, I really like turkey gravy on anything."}
{"text":"I met M for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  The parking lot was FULL!  I was lucky that someone was backing out, so I did not have to circle the lot or park in on a side street.  M was there already, got a table and ordered me an OJ.  =)

The server was nice to give me a few mins to review the menu before she came back.  I ordered the Croissant Breakfast (two scrambled eggs with cheddar with 
sausage on a butter croissant).  And I had to order the French Toast too.  I love French Toast!!!  The eggs were a little too runny for me but other than that it was good.  The French Toast was pretty darn good too.  The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast. There was a sign directing people to seat themselves; we chose a booth by the window. Our waitress arrived and asked if we would like to get started with drinks first. We both ordered coffee and water. She returned after bringing our coffee and water to take our orders.
i ordered the combination omelette with home fries and whole wheat toast. My husband ordered the corn beef hash served with three eggs over easy, and biscuits and gravy. Our food arrived after about 20 minutes: fresh and hot. Everything tasted wonderful, with the right amount of seasonings. I tasted my husband's biscuits and gravy--and the gravy was not overpowering--I could taste the sausage in it, and it had a nice blend of spices.
The service and food is outstanding. The prices are reasonable because they feed you here--the portions are large, you shouldn't leave hungry.
I like it when I can go into a restaurant and have excellent service along with delicious food. Its the best of both here at Joe's Diner. 
We will return in the future."}
{"text":"Solid breakfasts.  Omelettes and Pancakes are perfect.  Surprisingly the biscuits are not good.  Friendly staff and lots of room."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast best I've had in a long time Joan was really nice she's also the owner and excellent prices"}
{"text":"5 star pancakes, 3 star service and facilities. The pancakes are perfect. Super light and fluffy. A \"short stack\" (two big pancakes) is perfect for a normal human being. Service is just so-so -- nice enough, but slow/infrequent. And what's up with the low/no AC policy at 11:00 a.m. in August? You do NOT want to be sitting in the front section of the restaurant. At least there was a big floor fan sending air to the back room, but nothing up front. I'd enjoy my breakfast a lot more if it weren't 85-90 degrees in there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, but they left me in a food coma. I asked for an extra slice of bread instead of their breakfast potatoes, but they gave me them anyway and a pancake. And toast. And my omelet. I used their jam (I assume homemade?) on the pancake with some butter and I was in business. The omelet was okay, but didn't hit my spot like the pancake did so maybe that was a good thing. Also, I don't normally like hash browns or potatoes in the morning, but those breakfast potatoes were GOOD. Orange juice was great and they were friendly, so I was happy. I'd go to this place over a Denny's any day."}
{"text":"Ordered the number two with two eggs over easy, home fries, and sausage & bacon..brother ordered chicken salad sandwich on wheat with fries...both menu items were delicious after a long flight in. The place was packed on this late morning on Saturday...the waiter was very energetic and friendly, checking up on us more than once especially about the coffee. Great place for a quick breakfast/lunch at a very affordable price."}
{"text":"If the monte cristo was deep fried and dusted with some powdered sugar, this would be the closest to a \"good traditional / boardering on excellent\" monte cristo you could get in the valley.  My wife's waffles were delicious.  We ordered through Postmates.  We will give another go in a week or so."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't rated this place yet! Mmmmmm... Joe's food is so good. 

First, the place is attached to an old garage. Which is super super cool. The whole place is well decorated, the theme is really fun. The first time we went, it was great. The second time we went, we met Joe! He came over to the table and chatted for a bit. Very cool. The kids always have a good time here. The prices are very fair. 

We've had a little of everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I just love this little local spot."}
{"text":"Great job Joe! Breakfast was delicious and exactly how we ordered it! The little ones shared the breakfast bowl (they brought out two separate bowls so we didn't have to separate ourselves) eggs were cooked to perfection for my husband's breakfast, and my corned beef hash was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it yet.  The service is friendly, the place is cute and comfortable and the food is delicious!  I usually get their pancakes which are really good and my boyfriend alternates between the chorizo omlette and the corned beef hash both are yummy!!  Joe often comes out from the kitchen and chats with the customers when he's able.  Anyway, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Its just a matter of time before this place is packed. Prices were great and no waiting on a Sunday Morning.  Had the two eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon for $5.99. 

Going again next weekend and possibly for take out. 

John"}
{"text":"When I pulled in there was only about 4 cars in the parking lot. First be careful walking up to the door, the black out stuff over the door doesn't just block out the sun, it blocks out everything. My hand got rammed as I didn't see someone coming out. Don't you go in/out the same way you drive on the road in the USA? Well, she didn't get that memo.

Two young ladies greeted me and told me to sit anywhere. I sat and was quickly greeted by Amanda. She asked for my drink order, I really wanted coffee, and asked if she had FuFu coffee. I liked that she understood what I was asking for because I like the sweet/creamy/flavored coffee, but she said No, just regular coffee. So I got a soda.

When she came back with my drink I ordered the Chef's Special Corned Beef Hash. I wanted my yolk to be runny and asked if that was sunnyside up. She suggested the eggs to be flipped, I assumed it was the same thing so said yes. Not sure what happend, but one egg had some runniness, the other one was cooked through. The hash was well done and tasty. The biscuits and gravy was okay... the gravy had a few sausage pieces and when I say few, I really do mean 3 pieces. Its one biscuit and it was okay. I guess the meal as a whole was okay. Maybe my expectations were a bit high but I could have made a bit better biscuit & gravy with eggs how I wanted.


As I waited the diner quickly filled up with people. I noticed the lady who took my order was pointing out to the other waitresses, a bill was ready, a table to clear, a coffee cup needs filling, etc. As it got super busy I waited for awhile to get my check. Leaving the place I noticed that a majority of the spaces were filled, including the lot behind the building.

The atmosphere is casual, the tables will be changed out with advertisements from other business', so if weren't bombarded with ad's everywhere in your life, you'll be eating with more in your face.

Would I be back? Not sure...."}
{"text":"A simple review. Based on two breakfast experiences at Joe's.

Pros: 
- The pancakes were very good. 
- Croissant egg sandwich was also quite good. Same for the bacon.

Cons: 
- Home fried potatoes are so salty, they're inedible. No excuse for this.

- I waited about 20 minutes for a two egg plate with potatoes and toast. The food was fine but the problem was when I received the meal, everything on the plate was luke warm which meant it sat for a while before being brought to me. Not good.

Which brings me too...

- Service and vibe are just plain weird. When you walk in, there's no sign to seat yourself or a hostess to seat you. Are you supposed to read their minds and figure it out yourself? Joe's really doesn't seem to get the customer service thing that professional restaurant owners understand. They seem to have no sense of their customers when they walk in. Both times, I did not feel welcome there by the staff or that my business was appreciated in any way or that they cared if I came back or not. I wouldn't describe the staff there as surly. Just indifferent. To me, Joe's Diner comes across as a business not run by experienced or successful restaurant owners.

Conclusion: I see no overwhelming reason to return. I sooner stand in line for an hour at Matt's than to walk right in and seat myself at Joe's."}
{"text":"Best pancakes EVER! AND I am not a pancake person!  The new location is amazing! The owners have always been very personable and friendly every time we've visited! Only downside is one particular person who seats customers periodically...i get what Joe is doing and good for him but she's very rude."}
{"text":"This place was awesome...the food was delicious! To top it off the service was great....everyone was so welcoming and kind. The food was served quickly...I definitely suggest you try the pancakes and the breakfast bowl...amazing!"}
{"text":"I work in the local area and we wanted a quality breakfast, but on the go. We ordered take out and they had everything ready in 10 minutes of the call. It was really good and filling. 

The side order of bacon is legit. It's not that bacon you buy when you are on a budget, that's for sure ;) The chorizo gravy was amazing, with a little spicy kick to it- it's worth the upgrade. Had I know these guys were here, I'd have been coming here more often"}
{"text":"Cozy little diner with fast service. Twice Deb has taken my order and it was perfect and reasonably priced. I have only tried the breakfast so far.

The great: panckes! Not like ihop; the real kind that are thin and griddle-yummy. Biscuits and gravy; apparently I was wrong about hating chorizo because the gravy is about as good as you'll get in phoenix. The only better is the cream gravy at Texaz on the chicken fried steak. The breakfast potato cubes are delicious and well seasoned.

The good: corned beef hash could have been a bit crispier. The eggs I requested very softly scrambled could have been a bit runnier; it seems they were just scrambled as usual. The chicken fried steak was okay, but clearly came from a bag of frozen steaks. Even the delicious gravy it was smothered in could not mask this observation. At the $10.99 price, i expect more from a diner. f you want a genuine chicken fried steak, wait until Texaz Grill opens and get a monster real one for less. I am from Texas soiknow what I'm talking about here.

The bad: the sausage patties. I hate to dis a sausage anything, but the patty was cold and 'gamey'. Go for extra bacon if you can. Bacon was a bit cold and hard, but still better than the sausage.

Overall, I like their food and will return to try the Monte Cristo which sounds fantastic."}
{"text":"Had the delicious chorizo biscuits & gravy...still yummy! However....I asked for 2 eggs over easy with my order and did not receive them with my meal. The server apologized and said she would have them right out. A few moments later I receive a small plate with 2 eggs that were already leaking yolk from the underside ....decided to overlook it, but on my first bite I realized the entire underside of the eggs were raw. I just would have hoped that either the cook OR the server would have looked at what they were serving me and saw that it was not right. Also, the belgian waffle that my husband and daughter shared tasted like a frozen waffle and it was served with the whipped cream and a very very watery bowl of strawberries on the side, not appetizing at all. The breakfast burrito here is very tasty, but not very big, and comes with nothing else for $7...not the best deal on the menu, that's for sure. I will go back for the biscuits & gravy and might try some other menu items that I have heard others talk about. I still consider this a good place and most items are priced low."}
{"text":"Ah, there's nothing worse than crushing disappointment on a Sunday morning.  Well, maybe I'm being a wee bit melodramatic, but when I'm famished I tend to get cranky.  Joe's Diner is a hop skip and a jump away from our house and I've been driving past it for months thinking \"hmm... wonder if that place is any good\" .  So this morning, in what I thought at the time to be a flash of brilliance, I looked up Joe's Diner on Yelp (which very rarely leads me astray) and to my delight this neighborhood establishment had a 4 star average.  Not too shabby, and certainly worth a shot, right?! WRONG.  We walked in and it was busy (expected on a Sunday morning) and we were quoted a 10-15 minute wait. Fair enough.  But it was absolutely swelteringly hot and humid inside (swamp cooler maybe?!) and smelled funny (raw eggs left out?).  Still, we waited-- there had to be a good reason this place got 4 stars.  As promised, in about 12 minutes, the hostess lead us to the back seating area, but not to a table, and then just left us there standing, bewildered.  A few minutes later, another employee saw us there looking lost and hastily wiped off a nearby table and told us we could sit down.  Once seated, we were surrounded by tables of screaming children (not the establishment's fault by any means, but definitely did not improve our experience).  As we sat for 15 minutes, without so much as a glance from any of the servers, we soaked in the sweaty, stinky, dirty (did I mention the floors were filthy?), loud atmosphere.  It appeared there was no hope of acknowledgement by a server, much less a glass of water or a desperately needed cup of coffee, so we threw in the towel.  We stood up and walked out, defeated, hungry, non-caffinated, sweaty and disappointed, again without so much as a glance from any of the staff.  

I want to believe that this was just an unusually bad day, maybe because it was a busy Sunday, maybe because the stars weren't aligned, who knows... and that Joe's Diner really does deserve it's 4 stars.  I'd love to have a decent (if not awesome) locally owned breakfast establishment nearby, but I don't know if Joe's is that place.  Will we be back to give it another go?  Maybe, only if we're feeling optimistic,  patient, cool, and pre-cafinated."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Food was delicious. Server was attentive. The only problem is it's took awhile for the food to arrive, but after eating it we all agreed that it was worth the wait. Biscuit and chorizo gravy was out of this world. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place was great! I was visiting Phoenix and had no idea where to eat breakfast by myself on a Sunday morning. After reading a few Yelp reviews I chose this place, and I was very happy I did. 

Very friendly service from both the hostess and server. This place has that old diner feel which I really like. It was very clean inside. It wasn't overly crowded either. And there is even a counter you can sit at if your by yourself. 

My food came out and everything was so tasty! I got a waffle, eggs, bacon and sausage. All the food was of decent quality and prepared perfectly. 

Plenty of parking in the private lot is available. 

On my next trip to Phoenix I wont think of eating breakfast anywhere else but Joe's."}
{"text":"Seemingly decent looking place,  we wanted to try given it's proximity to our home....will not return!  Sub par food, mediocre service, not a great value for the buck, and possible the worst restroom on 7th Ave, disgusting!"}
{"text":"Locally owned business with all the standard diner fare, a few twists, and executed especially well.  I've been here at least a dozen times with my girlfriend who introduced me.  We drive out from Chandler past 700 other breakfast spots because she used to live in the area and the biscuits with chorizo gravy can't be beat (I've tried).  I don't mind because I always have a good experience.  Joe and Joan are the owners and really care about making sure the guest are happy.  Joe can always be seen making his rounds talking to people and more often than not Joan is serving tables herself.  

This past weekend I tried the corned beef hash and my girl ordered the biscuits and chorizo gravy with a side of bacon.  I think we waited about 5 minutes before Joan who was serving us stopped by to let us know that we were going to be waiting a few extra minutes for some biscuits to come out of the oven.  We didn't really mind and the food was great as always.  The corned beef hash was perfectly crispy and the yolk in the eggs over easy were just right.  They were happy to let me substitute toast as a side, and the bacon is always on point.  When we were ready to pay the bill Joan let us know that she was comping that tab since we had to wait, which I assured her was unnecessary but she insisted.  

I felt extra bad because I didn't have any cash to tip but our next stop was the Arizona Animal Welfare League and SPCA where I felt compelled to pay Joan's courtesy forward and donate the 25ish bucks I would have spent on breakfast and her tip to the charity in their name.  

Sorry I didn't have cash to tip you Joan, but hopefully you know that the positive energy you and your husband put out to your customers and into your food is appreciated. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are nice and fluffy!!! Love them.!! They make their own jellies and jam, also apple butter. They're perfect to spread on the pancakes. Plenty of food to fill you up. My son likes the croissant sandwich and biscuits & gravy. Great people; Great place!!"}
{"text":"Great diner!! Had eggs, ham, biscuits & gravy for $7.29. I could only eat half :)  It was great! I'm not a home-style potato fan (luv hash browns) but they were ok. Eggs were big, ham was hearty not fatty. Biscuits & gravy were great!! Coffee was awesome too. 

The waitress was wonderful and smiles :-D  We will be back."}
{"text":"I really liked Joe's; the food and service was always good. But one bad experience has me wondering if I will ever return. The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied \"I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you.\" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didn't even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joe's is reading this, here's a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says they're ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out. Guess we'll be eating exclusively at Matt's Big Breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"New Paint doesn't help the food...

I really wanted to like this place. It just moved to right near where I live and I was hoping the food got better with the move. I have twice now gone there and ordered a veggie omelette and asked them to add ham to it. Twice now they have just given me a Denver omelette. On top of that the food has no cooked in flavor it is pretty bland despite having all the ingredients that should make it tasty."}
{"text":"Got the daily special (Eggs Benedict) with a coffee. Nothing special but service was fast and friendly and it was a clean place. We sat at the window looking into the garage with the creepy stereotypical Native which was odd."}
{"text":"I have gone back four times now. Pastrami - the very best I have ever had. Meatloaf - very good but not superior (I would order it again though). Tuna salad - very good. A burger - exceptional. But you really have to get the apple pie with a slice of cheese. Real apples with some crunch and a pile of them. The crust is not just pushed up by steam it is full of apples. Coffee? I grew up ranching and yes that is ranch coffee. So it is now a regular for me and I really like the friendly contact of the owner and his wife. I like that I can sit in there until 3:00 pm and work. The WiFi is seamless and the music is not so loud you can't think. This is a family diner and it harkens back to when people spoke to each other. I love it."}
{"text":"Best pancakes, sorry Matt's big Breakfast, it's true.  Good breakfast choices, local ingredients and Melrose Small Business makes it a hit.  They have Cholula & a special California, chili only sauce that is very tasty.  I only recommend they add Chilaquiles to the menu because I am selfish and I love Chilaquies or Southwestern style Migas. 
Give this place a shot, the new location on 7th Ave. makes it a bit more convenient and the food is good."}
{"text":"We had just landed in Phoenix to start our vacay and were starving for breakfast. Luckily Joe's Diner was open - lucky for us! It is nice and cozy inside - seating and a bar area to add to the diner appeal. The food was made to order and came out pretty quickly (though we were so hungry it couldn't come quick enough!)! Hubs ordered the breakfast burrito - it was the biggest, thickest burrito I've ever seen - and we are from Texas where burritos reign supreme! I ordered eggs and a waffle - both were perfect. The service was with a smile and the owner, Joe, even came over and chatted with us for about 10 minutes about family and how he ended up running a diner. The ambiance can't be beat and the food is great too! We didn't get to try the pancakes on this trip, but next time we will have to for sure! This will definitely become a permanent stop for us every time we are in Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"The location is central, good parking, and internal ambiance is very nice and friendly.  All waitstaff were very helpful, pleasant, and happy to be there.  Very crowded on a Sunday morning, so get there early to avoid the rush.  Food is what you would expect from a diner--prepared by the kitchen, but does not taste like it is home-made.  Maybe \"home prepared\" from food-service supplier ingredients?  Pancakes and Belgian waffles are really good.  Potatoes are great.  CFS was more of a breaded, seasoned hamburger patty than anything."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, and usually no wait.  However, the past few times I've gone in I've ordered their delicious biscuits and gravy only to be told when they were brining out my friends' food that they were out of biscuits and I could either wait 20-30 minutes or order something else (and still wait). 

That being said, it is still a good place to get breakfast (I've never gone their for lunch) and has a pretty good selection of breakfast foods."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place...from the service, to the atmosphere, to the food, everything was EXCELLENT!! Visiting the area from Ohio, and so glad we stopped here!! 
LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are the best that I have eaten in Phoenix.  Also it is one of our favorites in our area of town for breakfast.  The owner, Joe, stopped by our table to greet us and is almost always there to make sure everything is perfect.  It is a great local and family owned business.  We also thought the coffee was great for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"The best pancakes I've ever had ... the cinnamon rolls are pretty killer to ..."}
{"text":"I'm not shitting you, this wasTHEEEE best breakfast I've ever had!

The pancakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD and the coffee is great.

I had the Eggs Benedict which was really good, due in most part to the really tasty ham. 

Unfortunately I did not order any pancakes but kept stealing bites from my girl's plate. Without question the best pancakes I've ever tasted.

I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was o . k .... Seems like the regulars get special treatment . And if this is the first time you came in , you are pretty much ignored . I had to remind my waitress about silver wear , my meal , my check . She never asked me if I needed anything . I am very easy to please . This is my first negative review I have ever written . This is a shame because I like to patronize my neighbor restaurants . I will not be back ."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place and which I had gone when I first moved in.  I've been several times now and would like to consider myself a \"regular\"  I can come and and see Amanda and she knows exactly what I want.  THE CHORIZO BISCUITS AND GRAVY.  That stuff is amazing.  My last time there, the owner sat down with us and talked to us about how to make the gravy.  He clearly knows his food and loves what he does.  Kind of a random location, but def worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Have been a frequent diner here and just can't do it any longer. I swear if any business was in need of an overhaul of waitstaff and timing it's here. 

It always starts with such promise. Time to sit and look at menu and someone brings you a drink. Then you order and the hell begins...

An hour this time (on a Thursday at 10:30) we ordered from the menu no changes. That's when the server disappeared. 38 minutes later she reappeared with two plates of food which she quickly deposited and booked it away. 

Want to know why?  Because our food was so cold except the bottom from the heating plate. Butter wouldn't melt on pancakes but it would spread. Ugh really?  Guess what happens then?  Yep 17 minutes of trying to get her to come on by. Finally she does and we get it taken off the bill. Not like we ate any of it. Seriously has this place really given up? Too bad. 

Save your time and go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here after an early morning flight.  It's not fancy but the waitress was nice and the food was good too.  Had an omelette and some pancakes.  Omelette was what you would expect but the pancakes were really good!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  But as good as the food is, and it's terrific, the wait staff and owners make you feel right at home.  Super service.  Bright, clean, large 50's-style diner.  Lots of regulars.  The customers know the staff and the staff definitely knows their customers."}
{"text":"They serve Arbuckle's cofffee!!!  The pancakes, biscuits, and potatoes are top notch."}
{"text":"We have met the owner a few times on our visits...nice guy but i just cant suggest this place. yes, the chorizo gravy and biscuits is delicious and the prices are good, but i have gotten sick as well as some of the sloooooowest service on multiple occasions. avoid."}
{"text":"Finally made it back and thought it was so so. Maybe I should have ordered something else. I had the omelet with ham, cheese, green pepper, and tomatoes and a short stack of pancakes.

It tasted ok, but wasn't really an omelet. the ingredients weren't folded inside, they were mixed in with the eggs. Like scrambled eggs. And then cooked and folded over but it was broken it half. 

It came with home fries which tasted ok too but they were 8/10 on the grease factor. 
The marbled rye toast was flawless. And the coffee tasted good too, although the waitress took a while to refill. I didn't like the pancakes much. Very thin and the batter was a little chewy inside. But the syrup they have on the table was great. Better than average for artificial. 

Overall this place was not horrible but the food wasn't good enough for me to return. I honestly prefer the omelets at Denny's."}
{"text":"It was a Diner.  Service was ok and definitely over priced for what they serve.  I ordered the two eggs and bacon with potatoes and the plate was half of potatoes.  The eggs were over cooked and patty style, and these were my scrambled eggs.  Told the waitress they were over cooked and just blew it off and took my plate.  26 dollars for two, way to much.  First time, last time."}
{"text":"01/20/11

It doesn't take much to talk me into trying a new breakfast joint... I've a list of restaurants that were bookmarked YEARS ago, and I've yet to step into those places to order my first meals there, and yet, I read a couple of enthusiastic yelp reviews about Joe's Diner, and I'm there w/in a week or less, savoring for myself forkfuls of those delicious pancakes I read about, but there I go, getting ahead of myself...

Delighted in finding ample parking (I think I arrived around 1030a or so), I walked into Joe's Diner pleasantly surprised to find a cozy 50s-, 60s-style diner.  Yes, yes, I read all about the atmosphere here, and I was still a little disconcerted, coming in from the open-air parking lot, but pleasantly so.  I liked some of the memorabilia, but I don't know what to make of the outdoor decor-- roofed and cemented empty garage w/ the parked truck?  Seems like wasted space to me- perhaps this is where the weekend overflow goes...  I initially was directed to the more-crowded room at the back of the diner, but it was much darker in there, and I wanted light (!), so I asked if I could have a booth in the more-spacious front.  \"Sure,\" the hostess said, w/out blinking an eye, and I was already off to a great start.

Couldn't decide what to have, so I decided to order the items that appealed most-- biscuits and gravy, pancakes w/ a side of fresh strawberry compote, and Thursday's lunch special of lasagna.  Ordered a cup of deliciously strong Arbuckles coffee, too.  The sausage and biscuits came out relatively fast-- good to note if you're really hungry and you want something quick! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA#LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA  I didn't care much for the biscuits, though.  Found them to be too tender.  (I like my biscuits to buckle, not crumble, a bit when I dig in w/ my fork.)  I'd requested the regular sausage to be substituted w/ chorizo, and the gravy was nicely done.  Too bad about the biscuits...  I next tried the lasagna... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw#CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw  Wow!  I really enjoyed the bites I had sampled.  The pasta was al dente- tender, yet had a nice bite to it; the filling was well-seasoned, yet not too salty-- meat was chunky, and the ricotta portion was generous; and the garlic bread that accompanied the entree was warm, perfectly crusty, and deliciously buttered.  I wouldn't mind returning back on a Thursday to have this dish again.  Last, but certainly not least, the pancakes!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw#cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw  Portion seemed small- there wasn't much of a rise, so I mistakenly thought the platter was of a short stack, but the server asked me to lift all cakes to see for myself.  Yep!  I counted three.  These cakes tasted amazing, and all they needed were a tiny bit of butter and simple toppings of macerated strawberries (I had to ask for a second serving of fruit).  Now, I wouldn't mind returning any day of the week to have a stack of these carb-delights!

Cool retro decor; warm and friendly service, a bit relaxed in pace; and two out of three knock-out entrees on the first try put Joe's Diner on my list to visit again soon!  I'd take out-of-town guests here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Wow, came here yesterday for breakfast since I was in the area and the place is cool.  It is a very good sized location and I thought the window to the business next door was very cool from the inside.  It is very 50's looking diner with a good size parking lot and the service was great also.  My waiter recommended trying the pancakes so I did and they were phenomenal.  I ordered the number 2 which comes with bacon, sausage, eggs, & pancakes.... the plate was just to much to finish but I had to eat all the pancakes because they were so darn good.  This place has a nice atmosphere and you feel very comfortable reading the newspaper and having a quiet breakfast.  I cant believe that the place has not been open for a year yet either."}
{"text":"What a great experience. The food was amazing, especially the biscuits and gravy. Coffee is fresh and tasty. The best part is the owners Joe and his wife. Joe came to the table and spoke of the local ingredienta he uses to prepare his yummy food. This is great place!"}
{"text":"We had a positive experience our first time into Joe's Diner. They had a ton of parking, friendly hostess, and solid food. I tried the corn beef hash and it was just what I wanted. Great little gem and nice alternative to Melrose Kitchen or 5th Avenue Cafe"}
{"text":"Went here based on the yelp reviews.. It was not disappointing. I had the biscuits and gravy (chorizo gravy) and my boyfriend had the chicken fried steak. We got there so early we even got to eat breakfast with Joe (the owner).. I recommend!!"}
{"text":"Took \"the Fam\"  and grandkids( Yes, Jeannie has grandkids) to Joe's for breakfast.  Not only did we leave without a huge dent in my wallet, we all left pleasantly stuffed!  If you like bacon, order like 5 sides of it.  You won't want to share this pig perfection! Thumbs up were given by all....French toast, breakfast burrito, pancakes, and cinnamon buns were all gobbled down.  My son and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  We both devoured them like Evil Skeksis! The biscuits are super soft and they have the gravy just right. I would go there and just eat that each time...for 2.99!!!!  It was more than enough food too.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and have yet to be disappointed in their breakfast. Have tried almost everything on breakfast menu...great!!"}
{"text":"Perfect!  Great breakfast! No complaints!

Pretty busy morning, but the staff kept us full and happy! I enjoyed my corn beef and hash with eggs...something you don't find on the menu at all restaurants. The only complaint I had was the d-bag behind me...who complained about everything in his life. Having D-bags for customers is no fault of the restaurant so no dedctuctions of points there."}
{"text":"I order the same thing every time.  Corned beef hash. I ask them every time I like my eggs over medium, hate runny whites.   Finally asked owner how come no one in your kitchen can cook an over medium egg? His response is it's impossible.  Really?  I can cook them and yet a diner owner says it's impossible.   Maybe he miss understood me but my wife was right there and she just looked at me in disbelief.  Also they rave about their biscuits and gravy and let me tell you they are average at best."}
{"text":"Service is friendly, pancakes are great.

I had the veggie omelet, and it was alright, really nothing special.  It does come with home fries cooked in bacon, which would have been nice to know.  I only found out because I notice the bacon in my home fries.  Small menu, not a lot of choices, only one lunch vegetarian option.  I probably won't be back, but I wouldn't avoid the place."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

I was really hoping to find a local diner with delicious breakfast that I could go to with three of my best friend, my Seinfield diner if you will, but unfortunately, this just wasn't the case. 

The inside is like a small Village Inn. very typical, very boring, and no pie. 

Our server seemed extremely overwhelmed, even though it wasn't super busy (we came in for a late breakfast). She was pleasant, but nothing exceptional about the service. We ordered pretty basic breakfast items, and it took an exceptionally long time to get our food.

I ordered the number two, which had sausage, bacon, pancakes, and eggs, which is a lot of food. Unfortunately, it wasn't great. Both my pancakes and sausage had been burned. I was happy to have the bacon as a back up which thankfully, was cooked perfectly. The eggs were pretty basic, but I didn't have to make them so they were worth it. I stole a few potatoes from my boyfriend, and I will say, they definitely know how to make breakfast potatoes. this should 100% be your side choice. 

The best part about this is they definitely don't skimp on the orange juice. I did get a giant glass of OJ which was ..orangey. 

In my opinion, it was a little overpriced for the quality of the food, but you will definitely get a lot of food on your plate."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my breakfast and the device was excellent. Was honored to actually meet Joe. Happy to have you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite while waiting for my puppy at the vet.

-my wife ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes. The eggs appeared like the powdered eggs patients receive at the VA (tasted like them too). The bacon was barely warm. It was also dry as though it had been resting under a heat lamp. For the price, I expect fresh product rather than food that was clearly sitting out after being prepared.

I had a burger and fries. The fries were fair, however the burger was greasy and sloppy. The worst part was the bun which was also greasy, not crisp and was dense. Less than 20 minutes later as I write this review, my stomach already hurts. 

On leaving, my wife stopped in the rest room. She reports that it looked like a bathroom from a carnival or truck stop.

Suffice it to say, I won't be returning. Overall, it was a greasy disgusting mess."}
{"text":"After many attempts of having restaurants succeed on the corner of 16th and Campbell (people seem to think that the whole building is an autobody shop) I hope that Joe's works out.

I went there for the first time on Saturday...just decided to walk over and try them out.  Had eggs, bacon, and one pancake.  Everything was made delicious...and I have to highly recommend the pancakes!  I came back on Sunday to just have them again!  

The owner, Joe and his wife Joan (I had to make fun of that...good sports) are very personable and full of excitement for their new venture.  Joe has stories behind each one of his dishes.  It was endearing.

The only thing that they have to work on is there service before you order and after. (During they are great!) It could take awhile for you to be noticed to be either seated or for you to order your food.  And getting your check? Make sure you ask for it during your meal.  You may just get it on time."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot for so many reasons great food, friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere they have tables and a counter. Their homemade jellies are delicious and you must try their breakfast potatoes. Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Hostess not welcoming, staff running around trying to fix Order mix-ups, computer problems, orders delayed, etc. Joe, the owner runs around the place with his hair on fire making things worse. Really off-putting. Food is pretty good though. Definitely a frustrating and tense breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great little hidden diner right on 16th st. Monte Cristo's are on point. The muffalata is good (would be better with authentic bread, not a hoagie). Nice staff. Old school feel. Great prices. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Meatloaf special (Tuesday's) was very good.  Comes with mashed potatoes.  Coffee was very good too.  This is a fun, old-school diner with servers who've probably been there 20+ years and cooks who know how to work a griddle.

Prices are extremely reasonable ($0.70 for a side of one fried egg)."}
{"text":"I'd enjoyed Joe's Diner in its old location and was feeling good about checking it out in its newer, more convenient spot. Huge portions, good food, good service, what's not to like?

After I'd waited a while at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign, a server called out that she'd get to me in a minute, then went off to take the order of a large table. Okay, maybe they'd been waiting a while, and if you don't get that in to the kitchen, things bog down. Then another server came over and asked which of us in the foyer was first. \"Me,\" I said. The father with two kids behind me said: \"She is.\"

The server then looked right past me, picked up three menus, and went to seat the party behind me, the same party that was clearly puzzled and embarrassed to be seated first when they'd said it was my turn.

My strong suspicion, since I'm very tall and had gone for retro-glam in high-heeled mules and a large hat, was that the staff jumped to the erroneous conclusion that I was either a drag queen or transgender. That's an excellent reason for me to not spend money there: I live in a queer-friendly neighborhood because I like those values (whether I need them to apply to me or not) and there are plenty of places I'm more comfortable supporting."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place for the first time and stopped in to try it out. My wife and I were both impressed with the food and service. We had the veg omelet, it came out fast and it was great. The bread (toast) is fresh baked and the jam is home made. The owner stopped at our table to see how we liked eveything. We both got a great vibe and great food, we'll be back frequently I'm sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Cooked my eggs correctly the FIRST time. Pancakes...awesome. Biscuits with Chorizo Gravy...awesome. Prices were fair. Would like to see a few more options but hey, that they have is working. 
Service was excellent. Both waitress in duty this morning were very nice and pleasant but not over the top. 
You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Chicken fried steak was a food supplier patty but the sausage gravy was home made and very tasty. Potatoes were under cooked but eggs were perfect. A $14 breakfast. They need to step it up and prepare everything fresh or take it off the menu. Going back to try the pancakes."}
{"text":"I believe I already left a review for Joes, but if I didn't then here it goes. The owners here are super nice humble friendly professional business owners. I love their pancakes. They are literally the best pancakes I have had, and they are for sure homemade no boxed pancakes here. The food is consistently good. The servers here are prompt. Even if you order takeout the quality does not suffer. Joes is always a good idea. I have never been disappointed in all my years of coming here. It is always money well spent. Every time! Eat at Joes!"}
{"text":"I had been here once about a year ago when I first moved to the neighborhood but never reviewed them. I went back again on Thursday for breakfast. The staff was super friendly, I believe the owners were actually waiting tables and both were great. Its a sort of greasy spoon. The only meat they have is pork no turkey bacon or chicken sausage or even beef so if your not a pork eater you will not be eating meat here. I ordered a combo it had pancakes , eggs and potatoes. The pancakes were really good probably the best thing I ordered. The potatoes were seasoned well but not hot and the eggs were okay. Its not fancy at all but absolutely serves its purpose for breakfast and good service always helps. Our bill was $28 which isn't bad but also kinda high for a greasy spoon. I probably won't go here regularly but when I feel like good pancakes close to home I would definitely think of Joes."}
{"text":"So I had an extra early am appt before work and was done quickly. Consequently I was way early for work and wanted to stop and have a sit down breakfast. Of course I turn to yelp since I was in an unfamiliar area. It's hard to find a good old fashioned diner instead of coffee joints these days. The first place I stopped was a coffee joint...*strike* the counter guy was nice but that'll be another review lol. Next I found Joe's Diner. I walked in about 0645 and there were about 4 other diners seated. It smelled slightly musty probably because they just mopped so I can't complain about that. It's nice and clean inside. The smell didn't last at all and wasn't overbearing The server was very friendly.  I received a menu, items are very well priced ($ as posted on yelp) I decided on the corn beef hash because it came with 3 eggs and 1 biscuit and gravy. When the food came I received the eggs and b&g but got a slice of ham instead of the corn beef hash. She was apologetic and took and replaced it. She left the biscuit and gravy so could start with that, which I might say was *awesome!* I asked for the chorizo gravy, and so should you :-) then the eggs and corn beef hash came and I almost passed out out was so good! I only wish I lived closer to this place so I could come here more often!!!"}
{"text":"5/5 for pricing as the deals and single item options had great pricing. Options for $10 and under even a few $5 or less side items for light eating.
5/5 for food as the quality of food was beyond what I expected from a small diner in Phoenix (came for the weekend from California) and was impressed by the variety of food options and the actual quality of the food that was served was better than expected but the one negative was the speed of the delivery which impacts the next grade on service.
3/5 on service unfortunately. The waitress was attentive to getting me refills so I'm grateful for that but the food took a long time to be served. I understand that it's a small diner and that food is cooked to order but it probably took 20-30 minutes from ordering for the eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon(2,2,2,2)and the waitress didn't  really converse with us  or smile much but those small things can be overlooked. A good spot to check out if your in town"}
{"text":"Joe's Diner is a cute little family run business that offers home cooked style food. I ordered a meat omelet which came with a large side of potatoes and a pancake. Everything came from the kitchen quickly and tasted so fresh like a home cooked meal. Only downside is the diner is old and seems a little run down. I think for the price the atmosphere is fitting and everything was clean."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I had the veggie omelet and my eggs were so over cooked they crumbled.  Service was slow and the place wasn't that busy.  I won't be back and suggest you can do better at other breakfast joints.  The coffee was good but since the service was bad I only had one cup -  Bummer."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just feel like getting up, grabbing a hat and going out to breakfast.   Meh.  I can make better eggs at home.  Scrambled eggs were dry.  Potatoes way too salty (could have used some onion).  Sausage was just OK.  $2 for two slices of toast.  I should have saved my $ and went to McDonalds.  I'm just saying ... This place didn't do it for me.  The place had lots of \"regulars\" in there ... older guys stopping in for their \"regular dose of Joe's\".  Ho hum.  I doubt if I will ever return.  So it's back in the saddle again heading to Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I want breakfast again, Matt, you're my man."}
{"text":"I am not sure how breakfast is, but the lunch is horrible. I had the meatball sub, the Monday special. Subway has a better meatball sub.

Service was acceptable."}
{"text":"What kind of tricks do you have to do to get a drink refill... She drops my food off at my table, grabs my empty beverage glass and disappears.... I took two bites and left... I'm going somewhere i can have a beverage with my breakfast..."}
{"text":"Update for September 2017: We tried Joe's again thinking our first attempt was maybe a fluke. It was even worse this time. The food was so bad, I barely ate any of mine and the waitress never bothered to ask if everything was okay.

Original review for July 2017: We just moved to the area and came here for breakfast on 4th of July, hoping to find our new go-to breakfast spot. Unfortunately, this isn't it.

I'm not sure if they forgot about the holiday or just weren't anticipating that amount of customers, but it was busy and they were understaffed. Despite that, our waitress was very sweet and really on top of her game. She keep our coffees (which were excellent) and waters full and noticed when we didn't receive our toast. Excellent service: 5/5.

Although they serve large portions, the food was just okay. Biscuit was dry. Pork chops were low quality and over-cooked. Overpriced for the quality. Food: 2/5."}
{"text":"Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and I were staying nearby while visiting family in Phoenix.  We had breakfast here 3 out of 5 days--the rest of the family eats eggs/meat, while I am vegan.  We were all very happy!  Everyone else said that the eggs were exceptionally fresh-tasting, and then spent the rest of the meal trying to figure out how 'fresh' tastes--apparently, it tastes great!

I was happy with toast and fruit, especially since there was homemade cherry and strawberry jam on the table.  Amazing.  

Service was fast and very friendly, and prices were very reasonable for breakfast (about 7-10 per person; less for my fruit/toast).  The space was clean and seemed accessible if you use a wheelchair (large open space near tables at the front of the restaurant).

Thank you, Joe's!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The two lady's that helped us where extremely helpful and fast. She gave me extra whipped cream =) and the food was excellent too! Lastly the old movie style feel really set a great mood would totally recommend this place to anyone =)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were searching for local diners and we stumbled across this gem. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Joe who introduced himself and promptly sat us at a table. We ordered lunch and were both pleased with the portion size and the food was outstanding. I noticed people complaining (on yelp) about the time it took for the food to arrive, it took the same time as a normal restaurant and we went on a fairly busy day, so I didn't see any problem and I did not feel like I was waiting long for the food at all. Overall, we both really enjoyed it and we will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"A coffee joint down the street recommended  this place. And since I love the coffee joint, I thought that this must be good. WRONG! We were right by the door, cashiers area & had the worst service! The food was blah!! I will NOT return."}
{"text":"OK  I have lived here in the valley for about 10 years,  been on a search to find 'real' made from scratch sausage gravy and have finally found it!  great sausage gravy actually sausage/bacon gravy is fantastic BEST IN THE VALLEY !  Great Service super friendly staff....JOE even came over introduced himself and was very appreciative we were eating at his Diner.  I had the corned beef hash cook perfect and 3 eggs, biscuit and gravy  great meal.  I/We will return many many times  this is my breakfast spot now!  I hear the pancake are fantastic cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"What can't be faulted: Food and coffee are terrific. Especially the coffee. Also, I have been seated very quickly at each visit. The servers are delightfully cheerful and Joe himself comes out to speak to each table directly. It's a high-quality, old-school diner experience and well-worth the minimal price.

What is a bit of an annoyance: By applying all of that personalized service, the speed of the service suffers when they are even a bit busy. I don't believe Joe has enough help behind the line, and it's probably further hurt by his zeal for customer interaction. And it seems that maybe order turnaround time might be slowed by the apparent lack of any  computerized order management/POS system. When get your check you're supposed to pay your server, but if she's not around and you go to the front desk (because you need to get on with things), you won't find a dedicated cashier. Just a hostess. Who is very nice and cheerful.

It could be that this is how long service took back in the day, and I have been spoiled (with the other members in my party) by the super-speedy almost-flawless delivery of cold, corporate places like Chili's, Denny's, Applebee's, and other places who have teams of industrial engineers and MBA's to hone their model. In that case I fault myself.  I barely remember how things were back in 1978 or whenever.

I remain a fan and will return, but will need to keep in mind that Joe's requires more of a time investment than do other places."}
{"text":"I just turned 47 years old and I'm a fat chick not just a little bit of a fat chick...a fat fat chick and for me to walk away from the table and leave a sausage patty and 2 bacon sitting on the plate with one bite taken out of the bacon and had to spit that ut into a napkin has to tell you how unbelievably a****** this breakfast was this morning so awful I am dumbfounded at this point. The meat was rancid it has gone bad probably a day or two ago and they had pre cooked it and you can taste it being sour and rancid. Like I said be worse breakfast ever in my life."}
{"text":"Food was great, chorizo and eggs excellent as was the service. It's a relaxed atmosphere with a mix of customers. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Watch your waistline - nahh   forget it - enjoy!  This is one of our family's FAVorite breakfast hangouts.  I LOVE #2 - the 20 year old devours the Breakfast Burrito AND biscuits and gravy.  LOVE Joe's Diner for our family breakfast on the weekends.  And yes, we met Joe!"}
{"text":"I love this place, its had a 1950's feel to it, but the food is fantastic.  I always go for the Monte Christo Sandwich, its the Saturday special, but you can get it any time, if you ask for it.  The portion sizes are very good.  They have different daily specials every day.  And if you work around the area, you can call your order and pick it up.  I took my husband for his birthday yesterday for the first time, hes a fan now too, and I am sure we will be going back there again soon."}
{"text":"Dined here this morning. This place is everything I could ask for as far as a breakfast joint goes. The waiters and service are excellent"}
{"text":"We live across the street from Joe's Diner, and never got a chance to go because it's only open 7-2. The diner seems to be one of those places that has been around for a good long while and the Clientele all looked to be regulars. I ordered the pancakes, and there's something about them that makes me nod my head agreeably. They're more on the hearty side than sweet, and you don't even need to douse it in syrup to appreciate them. They stand alone and are good even with just butter. The rest of the food was standard diner food. I can't say I love the place, I don't think it was my vibe, but I can see why they have regulars, and I respect that. They're a plain-jane type of diner that delivers the staples of breakfast food just fine."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service with Joe himself making his meet and greet rounds while working. Impressive. Tasty food. Well done Joe."}
{"text":"Ummm yeahhhhhhh..... I don't know about this place.
My food look so sad.... I was sad to even eat it. My pancakes was so soggy. My hash browns was over cooked.. my potatoes were so soft.. *sad face* no taste at all.. And the lady was in a rush to get my mom and I out. Asked for napkins, she have me 2 napkins... 

I will not be coming out."}
{"text":"Denny's and IHOP fail to stack up against Joe's and their amazing food and reasonable prices. 

I was in Phoenix on my last day in Arizona when my friend and his girlfriend suggested this place for brunch before I caught my flight back to Oakland. I am glad I went along. The menu consisted of your typical diner food (assorted omelets, breakfast specials ect) and everything was priced under $10. I let my friend order for me since she knew what was good. Apparently, I could not leave AZ without trying the chicken fried steak with chorizo gravy and two eggs and home-style potatoes ($8.79). GET IT! The chicken friend steak itself was pretty good. But, that chorizo gravy really took it to another level.The eggs were nice and runny. The potatoes were okay but then I spattered them with gravy. I loved it.

The atmosphere was nice. Pictures of 50's stars such as Merilyn Monroe and Elvis adorned the walls. 

Service was kinda slow but I think that server was new. 

In short: Great food, amazing portion size for the price, 50's atmosphere, CHORIZO GRAVY! I would love to come back here next time I'm in AZ and I recommend you guys stop by too if you have the chance"}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast!  I am sure their other offerings are just as tasty here.  There was plently of parking plus it is very inviting and spacious inside.  There are not lines events though the food is worthy of mass enjoyment. But don't tell that Triple D dude...his appearance ruins the best kept secrets.

Stopping in around 9am on New Year's Day I grabbed a seat at the counter.  All my typical breakfast favorites were on the menu.  My decision wasn't easy.  Ordering a cup of their house coffee, I later read this is a local AZ coffee, Arbuckles. 
Torn between the corned beef hash and Joe's Favorite #1, I decided on the #1, add sausage.  Now the #1 already came with one egg, a biscuit with sausage gravy and a ham slice but I wanted sausage too.  Damn gluttony and my protein craving.  The breakfast rocked!   The gravy on the biscuit was so damn tasty and my over easy egg was perfectly over easy!  
In the middle of my meal out comes Joe with a tray of little bowls of black eyed peas over rice, to provid everyone in the restaurant a little good luck for the New Year.  Quite a tasty little treat.  
The service was quick and friendly.  
I may live within walking distance of a VERY popular breakfast spot but I can see myself driving to Joe's and taking my visiting friends and family with me."}
{"text":"Went to a late breakfast here with my family on Saturday and were not impressed at all. Our waitress Carrie made you feel like an inconvenience for being there and she was not pleasent at all. When we sent back the waffle twice she was no where to be found. If it were not for Joe coming by our table and another waitress named Layla helping I would be rating one star. Joe is the owner and introduced us and made us feel very welcome. If this was based off of Joe and Layla alone I would be giving 5 stars! The pancakes were VERY good, the waffle was sent back twice till it finally came out crispy(thank you Joe and Layla for making sure we left happy). As a fellow server my advice is for Joe to get more severs like Layla and your reviews will be all 5 stars. Definitely asking for her if we end up coming back to try this little place again."}
{"text":"Last breakfast was great. Good good and prompt service.

Love the breakfast bowl. With the side of chorizo gravy!"}
{"text":"Good coffee. Good food. 
There was no wait for breakfast the sunday I went.
The hostess was prompt to greet us and seat us.
The server was friendly and got our order right...always a good sign!!

I am adding this spot to my breakfast list."}
{"text":"YUMMY! this place is a classic diner, and i love it. 
good service, comfort food, and at a great price. 
i cant wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time earlier this week and I love the very quiet, humble environment.  I had the corn beef hash-- delicious!!  I can't wait to come back again soon.  They also serve the best coffee!! The staff are very friendly too."}
{"text":"We went to the new location last weekend (in the rain), and I must say, I was a little disappointed. The new location doesn't have the personality that the old one did. It really just feels like any old diner. Also, we sat next to the window and I noticed the window sill was covered in dead bugs....gotta pay attention to details guys, that does not make me want to eat. The food was still fine, nothing too special though. I hope they step up their game in the future."}
{"text":"The bf and I went to get breakfast at Joe's yesterday and it was shockingly good! I didn't expect much, despite the good reviews, hence my hesitation to go to this place after living nearby for over a year. The food is simple, but good. The bacon was super crispy, which I really enjoyed. Their biscuits are buttery and delicious. Their potatoes were ok. The bf liked the biscuits and gravy and the coffee was good. I'll definitely be back soon! Ps- they're going to be moving over to 7th ave soon."}
{"text":"Beware of the breakfast burrito and the menu on line.  I ordered a Breakfast Burrito with NO meat and no sour cream for take out.  I asked for extra salsa.  I go to pick up my burrito and it was just an average size burrito with no extra salsa on the side.  I had to ask for the salsa and when I went to pay I was charged over $10.00.  Yes........$10.00.  I asked for a manager who did refund me my money but no discount off the burrito. I left.  Beware!  Chaotic and unorganized for sure!"}
{"text":"When you want a solid, good old-fashioned diner breakfast, this is the place to come. The food is pretty standard (although the waffles and strawberries were a standout!!), but when it comes to a diner breakfast, that's exactly what I want. Solid favorites and an endless cup of coffee.

My only complaint is that I wish they had a diaper changing station in the bathroom (new mom trying to figure out restaurant eating with a little one)! But certainly not a deal breaker for me, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is a dump! From the scowl face hostess  who won't look you in the eye smile or bother to tell your waitress you have been seated to the owner who will tell you This  restaurant is not for you with his mouth but F..ck you with his glaring Manson eyes. 
Leave your please, thank you, and excuse me or any kind of manners at home because they are going to get you nowhere fast.
Be prepared to get what your served whether it's what you ordered or not and if it's not what you ordered your still going to pay for it! I'm serious about the owner after showing him that what was on the menu was not what we were ordering he Lets us know  Joes Dinner was not the restaurant for us. 
So if you want a place to let your confederate flag down or talk about how America is going  be great again this place is for you. I read another review call this place a greasy spoon. I'm not sure if that was a compliment but I would call   it a cross between a Mel's Dinner in a Walmart  wherever chainsaw massacre was filmed.  I left this place feeling like I needed a shower.
The owner made it clear if you have any sort of standard you have set for your self set it lower and this place is for you! Oh and if you don't feel like putting on a clean shirt or for that matter no shirt no shoes this restaurant is for you."}
{"text":"OMG get the chorizo omelet!!! 
The place is cutely decorated and the service is super friendly, though a little slow. I am a booth girl, so I was happy to see that most of the seating up front was booths. I don't like tables and hate chairs.
When I see biscuits and gravy on a menu, I am already in love. Also, they don't have it on the menu, but try the chorizo gravy on your biscuits. We only knew about it because Joe himself came to our table. In face, he visited a lot of patrons while we were there.
The potatoes weren't anything fancy, but man oh man, that omelet was amazing. I am still thinking about it!"}
{"text":"This place has good food but great service. They where definitely on top of things and the place was packed, it's refreshing to see someplace that tries hard in central Phoenix. Will be going back for the biscuits and gravy. The scrambled eggs where super yummy too! It would be nice if they had hash browns but, I guess you can't get everything. Enjoy this place for the middle class diner it is."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite breakfast spots. The staff is always nice, the food is yummy, and the portions are huge. We have never had to wait to be seated, or very long for our food. It's definitely classic diner breakfast, but it's not too greasy. The coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"Dolores G and I came here for breakfast before walking the Melrose shops. Upon walking in, I was struck by how outdated this new location looked. I was expecting more of what their last location looked like. After reading some of the yelp tips, I decided on their pancakes. I ordered the short stack (2 pancakes), added 2 eggs, and a side of corn beef hash. Total was $8.50. Very inexpensive. The food was tasty and I was in a food coma after finishing my pancakes. Typical breakfast fare. 

Service was okay. At first the server was very attentive and then we hadn't seen her for like 15 minutes. Our empty plates were stacked at the edge of the table and we waited awhile while waiting for our checks. Finally I went up to the front and asked if we paid up front. She said we could pay but I still wasn't clear if we were supposed to or not. 

I think this is a good addition to the Melrose strip. I don't know that I would come back over other breakfast places in the area but I think this is heads and tails over Melrose Kitchen (around the corner) for value and quality of the food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Un-full glass of beer. Ordered a burger and onion rings. The lady who was expideting the food was so confused. There were 4 entrees and 3 salads waiting to be delivered. She kept looking a tickets and squinting seeming confused. She decided to deliver the cold salads before the hot entrees. My burger was a joke. The bun was mangled and part of it was missing. One piece of romaine lettuce that was 90% rib, a grim slice of tomato that was mostly white core and the size of a 50 cent piece and my fresh mozerella in a weird pile in the middle of the beef. Once probably warm and melty now a congealed blob. My waiter delivered a bottle of mustard and the most nasty bottle of ketchup ever, with dried spilled ketchup from some other diner, i didn't want to touch it. I asked for my onions rings, he left and came back and told me he forgot to order them. I passed on a re-order. The beef was tasty, but everthing else was way below par. This was a burger sale night, so maybe they don't care, but this was orginally priced at $12.99, burger only no sides. Not coming back here ever."}
{"text":"We went to Joes for the first time yesterday morning.  We only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. I ordered the breakfast bowl and my wife had the number two breakfast with pancakes.    My breakfast bowl was mostly potatoes with very over done scrambled eggs on top.  My wife said her pancakes were ok but the eggs were tough and rubbery.

Our waitress while pleasant enough, took our order then disappeared.  We did not see her again until she brought our bill.  We had to ask a bus boy to refill our drinks.

All in all the food was not impressive and the service sub par. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Joe's Diner is very aptly named. The owner, who sometimes comes out and visits with the customers, is named Joe, and it definitely serves diner food. We've been here three or four times, both as a couple and as a larger group. The servers do a good job keeping coffee cups filled and the food is tasty. I love the chorizo gravy and the chicken fried steak is very good. The various jams/jellies they offer are also delicious. This is a good place to go for an inexpensive, filling breakfast and also is a Yelp Cashback participant."}
{"text":"Joe's Diner was ok...I almost walked out because it smelled like eggs sitting in the trash or dishwater.  That grossed me out, but I was hungry and wanted to try a traditional breakfast.  The prices are reasonable and the food is good, not mouth watering, but solid food food.  The bacon was cooked perfectly.  Pancakes cooked perfectly.  Coffee was delicious.  Service was good.  Potatoes were good.  Honestly it's good food, but this place just smells."}
{"text":"Always busy - which is a good sign!  Sometimes means you wait for service, but breakfast is always good.  Great pancakes, coffee is locally roasted and decent, and the owners are always around.  Good neighborhood diner.  Great for kids - they love it here."}
{"text":"Great little place, good food, super-friendly service!"}
{"text":"so I've been here 3 times now.
First time a friend brought me as she knew one of the staff.
Fabulous service and great food for a reasonable price.
Second time,pretty much the same.
Third time,great service,food was good.
Was dining with 3 companions and they managed to get all our orders slightly wrong even though confirming them at the outset.
One companion ended up with another dish all together.
All the food was good,we were all hungry and posession is 9/10 of the law.
Good thing I didn't have my heart totally set on what I ordered or I might be disappointed.
I'll certainly be back for another mystery breakfast."}
{"text":"Drove by the diner the other day and noticed it replaced the Chinese buffet.   I was stoked so today the hubby and I went there for a Sunday morning breakfast; something we used to do a lot when we were first married.  We got there right before 10 and had no problem parking and were seated right away.  The owner was our waitress and the staff was friendly.  We gad some delicious Arbuckle's coffee which was hot too!  Love they had Sweet N' Lo too.  The hubby had the Western Omelet which came HUGE with a generous side of seasoned home fries and toast or buscuit.  He had whole wheat toast and enjoyed the homemade apple butter as well.  I had 2 eggs over easy (perfect ) which came with the same huge side of home fries and toast or biscuit.   I had the toast and homemade blueberry jam which was FANTASTIC! So glad we went and tried this great local breakfast place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Joe and Joan are about as friendly as you can get and the 50's decor is a sweet and charming way to start the day. Delicious, friendly, and the coffee is mmmmmm gooood!"}
{"text":"A greasy spoon if every I've been to one!

This place reminds me of the Midwest staple diner, full of good food and great people. David and I have been here several times and tried multiple menu items. Everything has been wonderful. I'm partial to their pancakes which don't sit in my stomach like a sack of lead as is the case with other pancakes I've had. The bacon is good, too."}
{"text":"I needed a place to eat breakfast while my stuff was en route from NC -- Joe's Diner is nearby so decided to give it a try.  The place was packed, so I snagged a spot at the bar. 

The breakfast burrito looked good, and it was -- huge too. More than enough for one person.  It came with a side of salsa and sour cream. The sour cream helped to cool it down in your mouth, and, well, there isn't much I won't eat sour cream on anyway. 

The coffee was just okay -- a bit too strong in my opinion. 

They make homemade pies for the holidays for you -- too bad I'm watching calories or one of those would be mighty tempting! 

I'm sure I'll come here again -- it isn't someplace I'll find myself dying to go every weekend though. 

Cons:
--Parking (lack thereof)"}
