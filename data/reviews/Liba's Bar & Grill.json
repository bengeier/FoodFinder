{"text":"Great schnitzel sandwich with dill sauce on fresh kaiser bun. Even better is the huge beer to wash it down with. All is definitely homemade and has an authentic feel. Friendly service and child friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hungry? I mean, REALLY, really hungry? 
Then try the combo platter of fresh schnitzel, real home fries/potatoes, breaded cheese, mushrooms and I think chicken too! The home-made dill dipping sauce is addictive and everything is made to order.
You know it's great when you hear the pounding of the chicken and pork from the kitchen. Always prepared to perfection.
Our family faves are as follows:
Goulash served with rye bread- daddy's just getting started
Fresh chicken parmesan - the portion is bigger than the plate!
The largest, freshest, juiciest chicken fingers you can imagine
Best brownie to share, served warmed and topped with ice-cream

There are no airs put on in here. A humble, genuine home away from home."}
{"text":"Just FYI, the restaurant name has changed to V's Schnitzel House. Still amazing!

This porcupine enjoying his pumpkin is me eating schnitzel at Liba's. Its really fresh and the breading is really light and not the least bit salty. Comes with a fantastic dill sauce. I had the potato salad with mine and its really really good. My new favourite neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"A cozy and homey little restaurant. Just ordered take out - the beef goulash and the chicken schnitzel.  Both delicious.  The beef goulash was perfect for this rainy day.  The beef so tender and sauce, oh so good and better with a bottle of red. The schnitzel, with a squirt of lemon, so tasty.
Will definitely order the goulash through the winter and definitely look forward to dining in the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for home cooked food, a full plate and good service than look no further. Rustic, not trying to be something it is not Liba's is a throwback to sitting in a Casual Slovak Eastern European village restaurant. Schnitzel is kick ass and highly recommended! On the odd occasion you may wait a little if busy but that is because it is all cooked to order FRESH! Sit back and enjoy a beer!"}
{"text":"Just found this place yesterday. No question it was the best schnitzel I have ever had. I never thought it would happen but it was even better schnitzel than Café Polonez. The side of potatoes were perfectly cooked and the creamy dill / garlic sauce was amazing. My son ordered the Halusky, basically its gnocchi in a cream sauce with bacon on top - it was so delicious. I will definitely go back here! This place has both large portions and excellent quality. I cant wait to return and try everything else."}
{"text":"One thu night in Oct the gf and i decided we were in the mood for some Eastern Euro food. You know, dumplings, goulash, schnitzel, the works. I had heard good things about Liba's as a great, no frills option and we were not disappointed. 

I sorta felt like Jerry Seinfeld entering Babu Bhatt's World Cafe as we were the only ones in the place. A little surprising as I had seen a bustling Liba's while driving by a few times. Regardless... we had the attention of the nice lady who was working both the tables and the kitchen. As an app, we shared the Slovakian street food staple smaený sýr (I like alliterations) aka fried cheese. It doesn't sound super healthy - and it's not - but boy is it good with a cold beer (0.5 l Krombacher on tap for $6.50!) to wash it down. For the mains, the gf had fried sole with hand-cut fries. The fish was good but the fries and the dill sauce stole the show. I had the goulash with dumplings and was not disappointed. The goulash meat was nice and tender and the spicing was perfect. The dumplings were just ok - perhaps if we went on a busier night, they would've been made \"more fresh.\"

We did not have the schnitzel - which other yelp reviewers have raved about - so we definitely have a reason to go back!

Final rating: 3.5/5 but I'll round up to 4.
Would I go again?: Yes, and i'll have the schnitzel next time for sure... extra dill sauce please!
In a sentence: A great, no-frills option when you're in the mood for some hearty Slovak/Czech food."}
