{"text":"We're not going back for a long time.  There was crap, bits of food and paper, of one sort or another under the tables that we could see from sitting on the patio.  The tables weren't all that clean.  Our waitress dropped my salad order on the ground and cleaned up only half of it.  She left the rest there until half way through the meal when she came back to our table to refill our waters and I pointed it out to her.  She cleaned up so little of what was still on the floor that when we left, I put my napkin down on the mess she couldn't be bothered to clean up so that we wouldn't step in it on our way out.  They weren't busy this evening; she certainly had the time to clean the floor.  Cleanliness isn't a priority on the patio; it makes one wonder what the kitchen is like.  Not cleaning up her spill lacked courtesy and was just a bit of an insult.  The food was just meh."}
{"text":"Reviewing the Cajun Ahi Tuna Salad (Portabella mushrooms, saut√©ed carrots, and some other stuff).  I have been to Tryst at least seven times and each time I am very impressed with the quality of food that I receive.  This last time was a take-out order and I have nothing but complaints about the $16 salad that I just bought.

Problems:
- Quantity of greens is far less than eating in house
- Quantity of seared tuna was also less than eating in house
- QUALITY of Tuna was atrocious** (Most frustrating part)

The tuna was low quality and had white lines throughout each piece.  These white lines are tough and are similar to the texture of ligaments in a piece of steak.  The tuna, the most expensive part of the $16 salad, was the most unenjoyable piece of tuna that I have ever eaten (cooked, seared, and raw).  I will go back, but only because I know of other menu items that are of quality... but I will not be returning as often as I have in the past due to the inconsistencies in the dishes (that I am more than happy to pay for, as they are of quality ingredients).  This meal was not worth $16 and I was not satiated."}
{"text":"I placed and online pickup for 7am, and they were totally ready for me with a hot breakfast! 
The only downside was that the eggs Benedict was too sweet, as were the sweet potato tots. I was in the mood for savory and everything tasted like it has added sugar."}
{"text":"The ambience at Tryst is great.  However, my husband and I have been to Tryst 4 or 5 times. The first time it was great but it has gone down hill since then.  Too much chatter between the staff when owners aren't there.  And today we waited at least 8 minutes before I flagged down the hostess for our waitress.  We eat out frequently and always give places a 2nd or 3rd try but we've had enough."}
{"text":"As someone who is forever on the hunt for great little neighborhood place at which my family and I could become \"regulars,\" I really wanted to like this place. In fact, I did \"like\" it on Facebook prior to visiting, and that's where the trouble began. 

On the day of our visit, I had visited Tryst's website, where there was an invitation to \"like us on Facebook\" and receive a coupon for a free appetizer. I did so, printed out the coupon, and my husband and I headed there for an early dinner on a Saturday. 

We debated over which appetizer to order. I wanted to try the local beer-battered green beans, however my husband wanted the Italian sampler platter. I agreed to let him have his way--OK, it was mostly because the green beans were only $7, while his choice was $12, and since we had the free coupon, I thought it made more sense to go for the more expensive appetizer. 

I told the waitress about our coupon, and she said she hadn't heard about it, and was going to ask her manager. She came back and told us he hadn't heard of it either, and said he was going to call the owner. The manager came over to our table and rather condescendingly said, \"That is a really old promotion, but I'll take care of it for you anyway.\" I pulled out my phone to show him that it was currently on their website, but he didn't look at it, just repeated that it was an old promotion but he'll give it to us anyway. I can't stand when service people act like they're doing you a huge favor, when it was kind of a classic example of \"the customer is always right\"--especially when they have proof on their  iPhone. Yes, he gave us our free appetizer, but not without a side of attitude.

In any case, we should've ordered the beans. As I noted to my husband, the platter--a selection of capicola, cheese slices, walnuts,  olives and some boring boxed crackers--looked like anything we could've pulled out of our own refrigerator/pantry at home to make a quick snack. He agreed, as we looked longingly at the plate of green beans on the table nearby and the one the couple at the bar were sharing. It was definitely nothing special, and the walnuts had a stale, rancid taste. (As a side note, when we later described our meal to our daughters, one of them said, \"It sounds like a Lunchables!\" Yes! That's EXACTLY what it was like!) Interestingly, I see it's no longer on the menu, so maybe it was already on its way out when we visited, and we just had the dregs of what was sitting around before it was eighty-sixed.  (Is that still restaurant lingo? It's been a long time since I've worked at a restaurant!)

I washed down the couple of bites I did take with the raspberry iced tea that I didn't order. Yes, I ordered iced tea, but specifically asked that it be plain, black, no flavored or fruity stuff. But actually, it wasn't bad so I kept it. I was really excited to see they had kombucha on the menu, even though I can't stand the stuff. I just like when restaurants are innovative like that.

I ordered the portobello sandwich, while my husband ordered the ahi tuna salad. I don't do raw fish, so I didn't try it but he said it was \"OK, nothing special.\" That's what I said about my sandwich. It was OK, but needed something to give it a little \"kick.\" I did dip it in his salad dressing, and that made it a wee bit more interesting.

But the sweet potato tater tots were the real shining stars here. I would go back again, just for those little nuggets of sweet, crunchy goodness. But something special and different like that needs a little bit of a special and different sauce, other than the little cup of ketchup it came with. I don't know, maybe like a maple cream sauce, or something savory, like an aioli? Then again, they're so good, they don't really need a sauce. But they certainly warrant  something other than ketchup.

Although we didn't have the best experience, we'll probably try it again but maybe for breakfast or lunch. That seems to be more their forte, anyway. It's a little small and cramped inside, but that's what gives it the potential to be a place where \"everybody knows your name.\" Now if only they'd know when they put a promotion on their own website."}
{"text":"Great food and server! Loved our shared chicken tortilla soup. Dear Hubby had blackened salmon over a kale salad. I had a burger, cooked mid rare- just divine with a salad with cilantro dressing. Loved it and the owner was as charming as can be. Our server (Justin?) was knowledgeable about all of the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"In response to Lisa: Perhaps since you were not there and I was, you should not accuse me of being inaccurate, never mind that I am the customer.   As was previously clearly expressed to Rachel, the QUANTITY of the dish was weak as was the flavor, hence the empty bowl when I was done. Rachel did not offer a replacement at all. Rachel even acknowledged that she agreed it was a bland meal at the company meeting when the dish was introduced to your employees. I was never offered a 50% discount - since I had to leave before the rest of my group I paid for my meal in full. That discount Rachel is referring to was offered to one of the other diners at my table who ordered the same dish and had the same negative feedback on it. What was expected from your server was either a replacement dish or a discount....neither of which I got. Your reply solidifies my decision to never dine at your cafe again."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOOD!!!  I love the breakfasts & the tuna melt & the club sandwich (no ham) with the dill dressing that comes on the melt!  That dill dressing is MMMM MMMM GOOOD!!!  The salads just seem to miss a beat for me every time..& I really wanted to love them.  BUT everything else is awesome!!  One other drawback is they say it's an organic restaurant, but not everything on the menu is always organic, so you have to ask the waiter about that each time.  Also love the staff & owner here, they're all nice & down-to-earth, charming, & super fun!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Tryst since they opened. I crave Hawaiian food and Tryst is one of the few places in town which serves Kalua Pork and Eggs for breakfast. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this Cafe was on the other side of Desert Ridge.
My husband and I didn't know what to expect when we walked in but it was surprising on how comfortable and unique it was. 
We got recommended the Hawaiian Breakfast and the Breakfast burrito so we ordered that.
The food was amazing and it came out quick, but then again it was 7:45 In the morning so we were the only ones there. I honestly have no complaints, the food was great, the server was kind and its only minutes away from our apartment. Tryst has a lot of potential, especially since there are not many breakfast places in the desert ridge area.
Definitely a great place for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Love that they are all organic and everything was reasonably priced.  The food came out quick and was very good.  The customer service was excellent! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I found Tryst Cafe after staring at it several times from the nearby Humble Pie's patio. We tried it out for the first time about six months ago and have been going back at least once a month ever since. There are SO many reasons I am giving it 5 stars, but since it's a restaurant, I will start with the food! It is fabulous. I have tried about 50% of the menu (breakfast and lunch/dinner), and have yet to find something that doesn't make my mouth smile and my tummy purr in contentment. The fact that most of the ingredients are organic or locally raised makes my conscious happy, too. The reason I am writing this review tonight, though, is the guacamole appetizer. Holy Guacamole! Fresh avocado, delicious pico de gallo served with little puffs of flour tortilla heaven that are as close to sopapillas as this native New Mexican has found outside of NM. I put it on my sacred \"last meal list\" reserved for only my favorite foods. SO good! Other reasons I love Tryst so much: 1) Joanna, our regular server who is a burst of fun, knowledgable, honest, and so kind to our 2 year old daughter 2) unique beer and wine selection 3) locally owned and 4) background music that is just perfect and literally had us dancing in our chairs with our daughter tonight!  I highly recommend supporting this restaurant...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Walked in to get a cappuccino. A worker greats me and looks puzzled when I ask for a cappuccino. He asked me to wait while he calls someone. I wait for like 5 min and the waitress shows up. I tell her I'd like to get a cappuccino, to go. She looks at me wired and tells me \"they only have a home espresso makers, not the industrial kind, and it takes a long time to heat it since it's broken\" (?! --no idea what that means).

I'm not a big fan of Starbucks but that was the other option (20 feet away) so ended up going there. Tryst sucks."}
{"text":"Liked the food here! The staff was very friendly too. We shared the ahi tuna salad and a burger, and both were great! Probably won't go out of our way to go here, but it was definitely a nice meal. :-)"}
{"text":"I have visited Tryst on a handful of occasions this year; the service staff is very friendly and seem to help each other out, regardless of who took the order. The food is good and waiting time is reasonable.

The Owner is a doll, often on site and very attentive..."}
{"text":"The salads are more like appetizers and the place is definitely not gluten free friendly. I had their signature salad and it was disappointing. I found it overpriced for what you get. If you are gluten free I would avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good, great location, relaxed and comfortable. The potatoes were the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Service was mixed; food was delicious. Wait time was about average for a breakfast place on a Sunday, but it should have been even shorter....the hostess was all but useless -- while waiting, we had the \"pleasure\" of staring at empty tables. The waitress, however, was on her game. She was quick, friendly, and appropriately apologetic when my gluten free pancakes came out undercooked.  But any issues we had were made up for by the manager who bought us a round of drinks for our trouble. Oh, and the gluten free pancakes, once properly cooked, were delicious. As was the pecan crusted French toasted with roasted almonds.  The  place is a little pricey perhaps, but when you consider it's all organic, it's actually not so bad. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"ORGANIC food is hard to find in a restaurant setting. And then top that with a great atmosphere, a great patio and friendly staff. What more can you ask for? How about a delicious portobello sandwich and sweet potato tots! Yum!! We happened to be there for happy hour so everything was half off. Enjoyed a tasty organic beer too!  :)"}
{"text":"So good!! Fresh made to order ingredients!!  Gluten free french toast, toast, pancakes and english muffins!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little concerned going to this place after reading some of the reviews.  I had the BBQ burger with sweet potato tots, and they were great!!  Our server, Sara (I think), was delightful and helpful.  I do agree that the food is pricey, so I purchased a voucher from restaurant.com.  I ordered my burger med-well, and guess what??? they cooked it med-well.  My tots were hot and crispy."}
{"text":"Pineapple upsidedown pancakes and pecan-smoked bacon. Did I sell you yet? Do you even need to hear more than that? Oh my goodness. The PB & J french toast is something extra special too. Excellent coffee, pretty much just a perfect breakfast location. I like the look of their lunch menu, I'll definitely be back to try some of that."}
{"text":"Had a terrific brunch with friends on Sunday. Coffee was smooth and perfect and from a local roaster. Food was unique and excellent. Beautifully presented and service was very attentive and friendly. Nice job Aaron. We stumbled on this cafe before seeing the MIM and will definitely go back when we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went to Tryst on a Sunday during lunch for a family member's bday. The menu seemed promising. I decided on the seared ahi tuna salad for myself and spring rolls to share. I didn't think to ask if anything I ordered was going to be hot. I assumed the spring rolls would be hot because I've never experienced raw spring rolls before and any time I've ever ordered a salad with some fish in it- the fish has always come out hot. This was not the case. Which is not a big deal but cold seared ahi tuna is not good. The seared part of the title is misleading. When something has the word seared, I expect it to be HOT... but that's just me. The spring rolls were tasty -I just did not expect them to be cold/raw. Nothing to write home about but it wasn't terrible. 
And my fianc√© found a hair in his salad and I lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance.  Adjacent to Humble Pie - Tryst won the coin toss and so did we.  Nice concise menu.  Prices are somewhat reasonable.  Discounts on drinks at happy hour and live music on Mondays.  Waiter/bartender was friendly and helpful.  Service was quick.  Food was top-notch.  Fresh, tasty and presented well.  A very pleasant surprise.  We leave near downtown and this is out of our way but they do bear repeat visits.  We will be back when we are up that way again."}
{"text":"We love Tryst Cafe for lunch and dinner. The ingredients are high quality, the food tastes great, and the atmosphere is very pleasant. It can get busy in the evenings, but this is only a testament to their great service. We were told that they have award-winning breakfasts, but we weren't very impressed when we tried a few dishes. Their breakfast menu is still good, just not outstanding or as good as lunch/dinner.  We're lucky we live so clear to this cafe so we get to enjoy it more often!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice fresh tasting food.  I had shrimp tacos. Large portion. 3 tacos for $16. Nice and light. Clean tasting. Didn't like the cheese so much in it but good flavors.  Huge portion so I couldn't eat all 3. I think they should just knock one taco off the plate and lower the price to $11.
We also had the pork sandwich. Delicious sauce. Pork was a bit tough but good flavors. Potato salad on side was delicious.  I am not a potato salad person but the dressing was really nice and not too much of it.  
I will definitely come back again due to the fresh taste, selection on the menu, and friendly service. Also...they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something healthy to take home and eat. I didn't feel like making anything for me and my 10 year old. Nice girl who waited on us, however I didn't realize she was up selling my 10 year old. I ordered a salad with chicken and avocado mixed baby greens, maybe two raspberries. So, they were generous with lettuce, and nothing else. There was hardly any chicken on my $13.00 salad. Goat cheese? Where? Oh there is a piece of that. So, moving forward, my son ordered pancakes. First of all he's 10 and looks it. She also sold him fries without asking me. He didn't
 even finish his $12.00 pancakes. I left and called back to ask how my bill was 35 bucks for pancakes and a salad. No less she shouldn't have sold him adult menu, or she should of asked. Now I'm stuck with 10 dollars on 2.00 pancakes! 
I will never go back the food was descent, at best. Prices, ridiculous."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on PBS and had to try it. The Ahi tuna melt and vegetarian spring rolls both are delicious. And of course for happy hour I had to try the pear margarita which was on point !"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place & I'm sooo glad we came here today. I had the kaluha pork sandwich - yum! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on a Sunday to have lunch and we loved the food. I told them I was on the Paleo diet and the waitress was very helpful suggesting items on the menu and offering some substitutions. I appreciated that. I ended up having the Tryst benedict and it was pretty good. My husband also enjoyed his dish and his freshly squeezed OJ. Staff was very attentive and most likely, we will be back soon and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Wow. Came here based on Yelp & friend reviews and what a mistake. There were five in our party for breakfast. We were the only customers for the first half hour or so and the service was horrible. Waited for quite a while before having our order taken, only received drinks and coffee once with no refills at all. I ordered eggs over hard... not that difficult. They came out runny and gooey. I asked to have them cooked again and when the returned they still weren't done! No apologizes and no quick fix. Dirty dishes, floors & walls. The rest rooms were worse than a a college bar during spring break. Horrible experience. We will never return."}
{"text":"3 stars is a bit generous. I get the impression that they recently started doing dinner but were better off sticking to breakfast and brunch. We had a TravelZoo coupon and looked forward to trying a restaurant with an organic, sustainable-foods focus. I'm glad we didn't pay full price for our meal. I had the Jamaiican tilapia with mango salsa. The fish was nice, as was the salsa, but the so-called cilantro rice was plain, bland white rice - partially crunchy, partially mushy - with a weak sprinkle of cilantro. My husband had the beef Wellington. The cut of beef was really nice, cooked well, and tender but it was wrapped in a gooey layer of pastry, not the flaky pastry that is supposed to envelope beef Wellington. The bottom of it was raw dough. So...it seems like the restaurant is going for something but has a hard time with concept execution. 2.5 stars is fair."}
{"text":"We're big fans of Tryst and consider it 'our' neighborhood joint. We took full advantage of the now-defunct \"halfy-hour\" specials; great food at a great price.  Kids and parents--uniformly happy.

We've been planning to have breakfast there, as the menu looked great, but just had not found the time to do it. Finally made it in with the kids, a little treat before school starts this week.  And what a pleasant experience. Not only did we have a nice chat with our waitperson Courtney, but the food was delish.

I had the Tryst omelette; yummy, with mozzarella, roasted tomatoes, and pesto.  Sweet potato tots on the side; these are delightful little nuggets that I could perhaps pop into my mouth all day long, assuming I could keep them warm. One child had a piece of crisp bacon with a giant pancake, and the other had the Belgian waffle. Both were served fruit, and we all had beverages (including fresh-squeezed OJ). And we didn't break the bank.

Some mornings, there's a young guy who stands in the driveway off of Tatum, flashing his Tryst sign.  I wish more people would take advantage of the invitation, especially the Starbucks regulars.  I'm as addicted to my Starcracks as the next gal, but Tryst is a much better alternative if you want real food and not just a hot beverage.

Give Tryst a try, folks. It's inexpensive, delicious, and friendly.  And we really don't want to lose another good restaurant in our neighborhood; so come on out and support a local business.

Next up: Monday night happy hour at Tryst, with live music!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, solid coffee, and great food. This has become my new place to camp out and get some work done during the day, and there is something on the menu for all three meals worth trying. 

The food is all local or organic, and it tends to show. Definitely better than your usual cafe fare. 

I like the buffalo chicken wrap or sandwich- they marinate the chicken in the buffalo sauce (I think) as opposed to merely slathering it on after the fact. The same goes for a Caesar salad with chicken. 

The huevos rancheros could use less tortilla strips and more beans or other filler, but the sauce with it is great (although I suspect more than a little calorie dense).

The service and staff are excellent- friendly, helpful, and even interesting when you talk with them. 

Overall- great place."}
{"text":"Breakfast was only ok but the sweet potato \"tots\" were really good.  The coffee tasted flat and was not hot due to the glass mugs it was served in.  Maybe I should have brought in a Starbuck from down the street!  The service was just ok.  I'd probably try some place else for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Service here is good. The breakfast is always good because Tryst has a lot of options including GF items on the menu. I would recommend coming earlier in the morning before the post yoga class/church rush on Sundays."}
{"text":"1) Service was just average
2) Bill was wrong
3) Very cramped space
4) Organic or not the food is way overpriced
5) Sweet potato tater tots were good

Lot's of other places you can go for a better breakfast at a better price. Just not much to choose from in Desert Ridge.  Still I thought the food was good, and will go back there."}

Pecan crusted French toast
Chorizo eggs

{"text":"Love, love, love this place! It's alway fresh and tasty. They have a pretty phenominal happy hour, half off your entire bill everyday of the week. That what I'm talkin about. Very friendly servers. Also they have gluten free options:) I love the sweet potato tots and and the ahi salad. My husband says they have the best pulled pork ever. I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is high quality and delicious however I'm only giving two stars because the service is really lacking.  I have done three online orders in the last 3 weeks and every week and each week my order has not been ready when I get there and they have messed it up every time!! To make matters worse the customer service has been TERRIBLE! For instance when I was waiting for my order that they messed up one of the servers comes over and tells me not to stand where I'm standing...excuse me I was standing where the lady who was checking on my messed up order told me to stand! They ignore you and treat you like you are an idiot when they are the ones who messed up! If you are in a hurry I strongly encourage you to not do their takeout! The food is good but I can't get pass the HORRIBLE customer service! After three times you've struck out!"}
{"text":"Bring it on burger and the sweet potato tots were terrific. Best burger I've had in a longgggg time! An Italian treat. Ice cream and homemade chocolate chip cookie to wash it down was delish! Great classic rock soundtrack. Great add in Desert Ridge. Check it out."}
{"text":"We tried the crab puff for appetizer, the veggie omelet and the french toast.  The crab puff and french toast were great!  The veggie omelet was OK.  Our server was really friendly and got all our order right and very accommodating.  I gave it 3 stars because the food we ordered were a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The presentation and taste of the food is topped only by the staffs commitment to exceeding customer expectations. Although known for their breakfasts, dinner and happy hour is superb as well."}
{"text":"The sweet potato tots are worthy of 5 stars all on their own. Also recommend the Sriracha aioli!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for all 3 meals of the day. I have had everything from french toast and pancakes to the breakfast burrito and huevos rancheros. The ribs are fantastic and so are all of the salads. If you love fresh organic food that doesn't lack flavor you will be a fan. I will say sometimes the service is slow as they don't always have a full staff. But for me the food is most important and i never leave here unsatisfied"}
{"text":"We tried to go to Tryst this am. We live right around the corner and have been excited to try it. When we arrived at 0800 on a Sunday morning we were told we would have a 20 min wait because they were unable to put together a table for 6!  The restaurant wasnt even 1/4 full!  Based on that experience we will never return. If I was the owner I would be furious.  There were plants of tables to put together- if it was lack of servers they should probably hire more, after all it was a Sunday morning. Shame on you tryst. We will never return. Thank goodness Starbucks is in the same parking lot. I'd rather spend $40 on coffee and coffe cake than spend $80 at a place where there are unfriendly employees!!"}
{"text":"Awful food and service. Went for breakfast. Food was cold. And bland. Then they charged me for someone else's food and blamed it on their \"system\" instead of their incompetent staff. The manager (Lisa) was completely unhelpful and never even apologized for their screwup. I wish I could give it less than one star.
In sum, pretentious overpriced restaurant thinks they're better than you. Skip it."}
{"text":"Sitting here ratting a late breakfast and the chef is eating as he is preparing the food,  the food has declined tremendous over the past few months"}
{"text":"This is a cozy colorful nook of a restaurant with a variety of healthy food options on the menu: eat organic, grass-fed meat, and there are many gluten-free options. The service has always been considerate and professional and the food delicious. I started coming here within the first month of their opening and I continue to come here. The few downsides: the parking lot is always congested and it can be impossible to find parking and it though it is cozy, that can turn into noisy and packed during high-peak hours. Great restaurant overall! My favorite \"guilty\" pleasure: beer-battered green beans."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited 10 minutes to be greeted after we were seated. Finally asked hostess for server. Got a glass of water, placed a drink order and food order.  Another 10 minutes go by, water is gone, still no drink. People that were seated after us have all got their drinks. We left."}
{"text":"Loved the experience at Tryst! We sat on the patio  and enjoyed our omelette breakfast. I had the super kale omelette with sweet potato tots--absolutely divine!! Just the right portion and blend of flavors. The man got his meat lovers omelette, he was not as ecstatic as I. His happened to be a little bland and in need of some salsa or spice. The service was great and fast which is why we are willing to give them a second shot at the food. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant for breakfast.  Service was quick and friendly, food excellent.  Will return for cocktails and dinner."}
{"text":"Another 1.5 star review, hovering between dashed expectations and frankly alarming.

Be aware as your read reviews to take those without clear corroborative evidence with a grain of salt, especially the positive ones. Especially if there are a bunch of shriekingly positive reviews lacking any specificity.

Tryst has been on my restau-radar for awhile now. I saw the owner speak at a celiac disease foundation meeting and decided to make a trip - sigh - . Went mid-Sunday afternoon. There was only one table occupied; they soon left, leaving us alone.

Menu is ... eclectic, leaning heavily into casual and simple fare like salads and sandwiches. There are hunks of meat with sauces on them and an \"around the world\" menu that rarely touches upon the actual cuisines of the nations represented. Don't take my word for it, go look at the menus yourself. Ireland represents with an $11 Reuben sandwich, and France with $18 porkchops. You didn't know that Reubens and porkchops with red wine orange demi were Irish and French, respectively? Neither do they, I assure you. 

[If you are one of those spelling-and-grammar-OCD types, be sure to take your meds before reviewing their online menu.]

There is a nod to local and organic in the hype of this place, but you can't tell from the menu. Provenance and organic-status aren't mentioned in most menu descriptions.

Breakfast is served until 2:30 only. Since that meal's menu has the majority of the gluten-free (GF) options, this was disheartening. My despair increased as I noticed that the majority of the lunch/dinner GF items were on the pricey side of the menu, things like $13 burgers and the even pricier dinner entrees. Many of the sides aren't GF. At the time I was there I was told the only available GF sides were fruit salad, tossed salad, coleslaw and black beans. Fruit, lettuce, cabbage and beans don't make me want to be a repeat customer. There are no GF items on the children's menu.

We arrived juste au fin du petit d√©jeuner and settled on burgers. My accomplice ordered his with sweet potato fries and a side salad. I ordered mine GF with slaw. They don't have GF buns for the $13 burgers. Note to somebody who might care: GF buns are widely available in Phoenix. Provide some for those paying $13 for an otherwise middling burger.

Accomplice's salad was obviously wilted from being stored in a cooler uncovered for a significant period. The carrots atop the salad had a touch of that white haze that carrots get as they loiter on veggie/dip trays. His fries were, as he put it, \"plain.\" My coleslaw was underwhelming, vague crunch and creamy mouthfeel without any flavor or color, strikingly akin to premade deli slaw.

Our burgers were tasty but not exceptional; good but not very good. And we were hungry, which should have heightened the taste - \"hunger is the best sauce,\" as they say.  You could make burgers of equal or better quality at home without any special effort. Accomplice's \"natural burger\" was smaller than mine, didn't fill the bun. He found this a touch sad. 

It's a smallish dining room, pleasant, a touch trendy, stained concrete floors and high ceilings. The design and decor do not stand out. Popular-ish music was playing a touch loud for the empty space. The hallway leading to the bathrooms and the bathroom itself had a strong odor of commingled sour yeast and dog funk. This odor increased inside the bathroom, which had fashionable fixtures including a Dyson Airblade hand-dryer.

It cost over $30 for two burgers and two soft drinks. When you are paying such a significant sum for a meal, your expectations are raised. You expect really good food and service. The service was acceptable, but again, nothing special. Mostly though, one is put off by the high prices and the mediocre fare. We did not try any bar drinks, appetizers or desserts.

[The establishment's \"wine tastings\" are comprised of things you could easily find at Costco (Louis Jadot) and Safeway (Fonseca Port). I recommend doing your drinking at home.]

I'm seeing a GF trend here: A restaurant with higher-than-average prices claims to have a GF menu, which is in reality a few stripped down, higher-priced choices from the regular menu. Often the GF options have a surcharge, even when the menu prices are already high. GF diners are pining for real options on a GF menu, things they can't get at most places or make easily at home, things like fries, breaded and crispy appetizers, satisfying sweets.

My non-GF-dining friends are becoming frankly annoyed at me for taking them to these dine-and-disappoint establishments. Any of a number of places are cheaper and better: True Food, Outback Steakhouse, In-N-Out Burger, Pei Wei. My summary is that this place has far better marketing than menu. I won't return."}
{"text":"I've been up to Tryst Cafe a few times now and I am a huge fan! Food it great, veggie options that make my mouth water and yummy drinks! They seem to specialize in organic options, even from behind the bar. They have sweet potato tater tots for a wonderful side to sandwiches and such. Extra special in my book! The staff is super friendly and helpful with suggestions.  Get yourself up to Tryst soon and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our first time in and had a wonderful experience. Our server Kayla was an absolute delight:  very attentive, anticipated drink refills, and helpful beyond the call of duty (thanks!) Finding food safe for our various food tolerances was a bonus. We will be coming back soon and hopefully often."}
{"text":"I love Tryst! My boyfriend and I go on Sunday mornings a few times a month and we always have a great experience. I have yet to have bad service. The staff is very friendly and the gluten free options are delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I first went to this restaurant a couple years ago and thought it was a great little cafe with good food. I think it has gone downhill. My girlfriends  and I get together once a month at places around Desert Ridge and hadn't been here for a while so we met there last night. While their battered green bean appetizer is really good the rest of my food was not. I ordered the ahi wonton cups and the ahi was fishy tasting and a couple pieces were chewy. I ate a couple because I was hungry but the fishy taste was overwhelming. Then we ordered coffee after our meal that was weak and barely warm. I thought it was an old pot but when she refilled it was the same, not good at all. I think we'll be skipping this place from now on."}
{"text":"Very average food for above average prices with service levels of ok to god awful. Unfortunately not a lot of great breakfast places in the DR area. Hopefully someone will come and give these guys some competition to elevate their game!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I found a way to go back there twice in the short visit I had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Thank-you fellow Yelpers for writing about this place. I would have never paid a visit to this secluded cafe if it weren't for your reviews. I was very pleased with the blueberry pancakes that I had ordered. Talk about a forkful of antioxidants with each bite!  My friend that I came in with was not too happy about the pineapple upside pancake that she chose, due to the batter not being cooked all the way through.

The waitress we had was awesome.  There was a 5k run that had just wrapped up nearby and many of the participants came here to refuel afterward. Our waitress was sincerely apologetic with the wait my friend and I endured with having our order taken along with the delivery of our food.  I felt she did a great job with holding her composure with the unexpected Sunday morning rush. 

Lastly, I liked how Tryst's breakfast menu had several gluten free options. I work alongside many folks that have a gluten intolerance. Its nice to know there's another place in The Valley that they can dine at."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Starter was fairly good, but entree (Florentine Samalom) was over cooked.  Good service and misters allowed us to eat outside."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! The portions are huge, so we ended up splitting the dish. Sweet potato tots are a must and their Tryst Benedict was an excellent take on the original."}
{"text":"This is my other \"go to\" breakfast spot on the weekend. We usually arrive just after 7:00AM, which means we usually are the first there. This past Sunday at least three other tables were occupied. I chalk that up to the snow bird season.

Highlights for breakfast: steel cut oatmeal, gluten free pancakes, breakfast sandwich. Coffee is excellent.

Charlene deserves fives stars for always excellent and exceptional service."}
{"text":"We love their pecan crusted french toast, breakfast burrito, sweet potato tots and of course their mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ.

Be sure to ask for Dillon, he is by far the best one of the best waiters in town! He was absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian Breakfast might be the meal I request on my deathbed. It's SO GOOD. I actually like the gluten free version better because the plain tamari is a bit lighter than the soy based sauce that comes with it regularly. The pancakes are awesome and I've enjoyed the steak and eggs too.

My other fav item on the menu is the Bring It On Burger. Again, SO GOOD. I also love adding steak to The Affaire salad. I have had it a couple times and the steak is always so tasty, juicy, melt in your mouth etc. The Naturally Raised Chicken Buffalo Sandwich is yummy too.

I took my dad and brother once. Vegan Dad had a Portobello Sandwich and seemed pleased. He's not super strict, as long as there are no blatantly obvious animal products he's good! I'd bet there are eggs in the bun though, so make sure to ask. Brother had the Free Range Chicken Tortilla Soup and the Caesar salad and was also a fan.


LOVE LOVE that Tryst is organic. I hope y'all will open a South Scottsdale or North Phoenix location one day."}
{"text":"Service is slow and the server we had addressed us by \" dude \" and \" sorry man\" \" my bad\" extremely unprofessional. Food was over done. Bloody Mary's were pretty tasty and the organic beer is good as well. Maybe it just wasn't a good day for tryst, but we probably won't be back...."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner, and not for breakfast or lunch, which appears to be the focus of this restaurant.  

The fried green beans and spinach artichoke dip were good as appetizers, and having a few dipping sauce options on the plate was a nice touch.  Kids gobbled it all up.

For entries, kids had burgers with high marks.  My wife ordered the garden burger, which was the table favorite.  I ordered the salmon, and while it was decent, it could use some improvement. One of the side dishes was a surprising revisit of the spinach artichoke dip.  If the owner could swap that out for some risotto, I could have  possibly given this place 5 stars.  Also as a side, don't miss the sweet potato hash - it actually saved the day by balancing out the lack luster salmon.

For dessert, try the gluten free cupcakes.
These bite size treats will not disappoint. 

Service was awesome.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the organic and local menu. My whole family loved this place. Went on a whim with a coupon from restaurant.com. Will def go back."}
{"text":"Waited for the hostess to greet us for 6 minutes, we realized they were busy so we waited. She finally came back, was rude and short with us, did not even greet us or apologize for the wait (by now a line had formed behind us) - she just said \"how many ? We are on a wait\" that was it. I gave her our name and I asked how long the wait was. We left and went next door to humble pie for a better experience."}
{"text":"YOU can ask them to add beef or chicken to the Beet Salad.  I think it was an additional 3 or 4 dollars.   OMG both were tasty but I do love the Beef a little more just depends on how healthy I am trying to be.. =)"}
{"text":"I stopped in one day last month when I had an hour to kill and I wasn't disappointed.  It's has a quiet, urban vibe and some great food.

I had the Monte Christo, mainly because I couldn't decide between breakfast or lunch.  This sandwich was delicious.  The side, sweet potato tots, could have been better...they seemed to be \"missing something\".   Maybe salt or a sauce to dip them in.

 A nice place to relax with a decent meal.  And you may just find yourself going back...I did."}
{"text":"Just ate at tryst and had the Rueben and the Buzz button, both interesting and amazing, if you're feeling a little adventurous the Buzz button will blow your mind, one of the most exciting cocktails I've ever had.  Also, i dont know who does the hiring, but those employees are all damn fine."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and found a wonderful location, great service, and great food!  My husband and son both had pancakes - supersized portions and very yummy.   I had the tortilla soup and organic beet salad as it was close to lunchtime - outstanding choices!  We are going to make this a frequent stop!"}
{"text":"- They off gluten-free breads and can do most items gluten-free here if you ask, even without the \"GF\" sign on the menu
- They are a little pricey...probably because the grass-fed beef, local produce and organic offerings...
- I really enjoyed my meal here with a grilled chicken sandwich w/gluten free bread

I'd only go back here during happy hour or on their Monday 1/2 price night because my family said that was \"quite expensive for a meal at lunch time\" and they'd \"rather have leftovers then clean their whole plate.\" -shrug-"}
{"text":"Dad and sister came down for a surprise visit. Uh oh, totally unprepared. Gotta jump on yelp and search \"breakfast\" for a quick pick. Tryst Cafe comes up. Looks alright. Let's go!

And lo and behold, it is indeed alright! Ordered the Hawaiian Breakfast for $12. Came in a very trendy bowl that I guess I'd describe as egg-chair-esque, yeah? Smoked pork had great flavor and went surprisingly well with the rice, lettuce, and egg. Also, the bowl was lightly coated with a soy sauce glaze that just completed it. Awesome!

Service was very slow though. It took over half an hour after ordering before the food finally got to our table. By the time the food got to our table, people were already ordering lunch!

But the food was good enough soooo 4 stars! Yay!"}
{"text":"Food is healthy and delicious here!  It's hard to find a place that serves healthy options now days and they also have many gluten free options for those with gluten allergies. You can also have a drink if you'd like, organic and gluten free optins! Crazy, I didn't know you could also have a healthy drink, lol."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The brussel sprouts are to die for. Will definitely come back! The seared ahi tuna salad was also good. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Discovered Tryst (Organic) Cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago. Have had breakfast, lunch & dinner there. They have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first. Also many gluten free choices.

They've had their ups & downs with service, but it's usually good. The happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours & choices.

My wife & I both love their Seered Ahi Tuna Salad, it's fantastic! We both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled. Help Tryst thrive!"}
{"text":"Just order a Bring It On Burger,the meat was so dry ,the lettuce was old and turn bad already! The meat taste like cooked 2days ago and than reheat when someone order?"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to try this wonderful little gem tucked away in a strip mall across the street from Desert Ridge! 

It was the perfect afternoon for dining al fresco. My dining companion had been there before so she knew what she wanted right away. I had a hard time deciding between breakfast and lunch (they serve breakfast until 2:30). Everything on the menu is organic, and they have gluten free options as well. All I knew was that whatever I chose for an entree, I had to get the sweet potato tots on the side. My co-Yelpers . . . you are so right! The tots arrived fresh and hot . . . I was so excited to try one, I burnt my mouth on the first. OMG, they were so divine . . . sweet, crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. You could easily order these for dessert!

For an entree I had the veggie omelet. I didn't even have to tell them I liked my omelet on the light side, not overcooked. It was splendid! I also loved the fact they the didn't butter my rye toast! 

My girlfriend ordered the summer rolls which she loved, and the hummus. The hummus came with a huge plate of pita, not the typical little serving you get at some restaurants. I tentatively tasted the cilantro hummus (I sometimes like cilantro and sometimes don't), and I was pleasantly surprised at how the flavors worked so well together. Who would have thunK? 

As I watched other orders being delivered to tables, I couldn't help but notice the gigantic hamburger and the huge salads. I will definitely be suggesting Tryst as a regular meeting place for lunch, as there are so many items on the menu I still want to try.

Service was very good. Our server was actually quite unobtrusive, but still expedient. Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find Tryst to be overpriced at all."}
{"text":"I was looking to try something different, something new and this place was great! I was expecting it to be more of a order and pay, find a seat and sit down place, since it said cafe. It was actually a please wait to be seated kind of place. It was small so we were seated at the bar, it wasn't bad just different. People were friendly, the food was absolutely delicious, I got the grilled cheese sandwich, though the crust of the bread was falling apart, but it wasn't bad just a little messy. I would probably go back, but it's a little expensive and they charge for a side of ranch and to split your bill. Overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"At first I was a little surprised by the size of the cafe.  I guess in that area I was just used to a larger place.  But actually that is one of the things I ended up loving about the experience.  We were in the area to go to the MIM (which is a must see as well).  The Tryst Cafe had that small cafe feel that I wish I had near my home.  The food was great, I mean really great. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and loved every bite.  The food was fresh, the service was great (our tasty Jasmine Tea was never empty).  With that being said I do have one issue (and I hope the owner reads these).  They really, and I mean really, need to sort the silverware in the back.  The cafe has nothing but hard surfaces (floor, metal tables, etc.) and the first 10 minutes that we were there last Saturday for lunch.  The girls from the back were tossing forks and knives into the sorting bins like they owed them money or something.  It was pretty loud and nerve racking, but it did eventually stop and the food and service more than made up for it.  I will return for sure, I just wish it wasn't so far away from my home (Mesa)."}
{"text":"Extremely accommodating staff who listens to their patrons! 

We visited on a Monday night in a group of 5.  We tried several margaritas and ordered entrees.  As it was cinco de mayo they had a special menu.  We tried the taquitos, chili relleno, and adobo tacos.  Truly reasonably priced with a nice portion size & overall fresh straightforward food.  

The chili relleno was a bit spicy for my friend and she wasn't going to complain.  Obviously chili heat can vary from each chili so it's not really the chefs fault.  When the nice manager checked on our table and we mentioned the dish was a bit spicy she immediately offered to bring a replacement taco or enchilada plate on the house! My friend got the adobo tacos and enjoyed them.

When the bill came we had several forms of tender and our sweet server took it in stride with a smile.  For how busy they were, it was awesome to see the employees maintain their cool."}
{"text":"This place has the most savory food we've had eating out in a long time!  From the ahi appetizer we want to eat again tonight to the pork adobo tacos with delicious flavor from 1st bite to the last.  Our family of 4 was looking for a great hamburger and we found a dish for everyone as well as a great happy hour organic Bison draft beer.  We had excellent service and  great food.  We wish there was one in San Diego!  If you are visiting JW Marriott this is a little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place. The food and drinks are great.  On our first visit, they gave us a card for a free appetizer or dessert. So we went back on Sunday, 8/12, and on top of the free appetizer, we were given a manager discount of 20% off! My fiance loved the tortilla soup. I loved the cheeseburger on brioche bun. The salads are innovative. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I live close by so it is easy to go here and I have eaten from this place 4 times in the last week. The staff is great and the service is quick which is nice. Probably the best thing about this place though is the ingredients. It seems like they have very high quality suppliers. The tomato-basil wrap is excellent in taste and texture. The chicken with rice and vegetable dinner is very well prepared and the ingredients look and taste very fresh. The cooks seem to be very well versed and cooked everything I have had there perfectly.  The only thing that is a drawback to me is the price. Ten bucks for a breakfast wrap is a bit high but I guess you get what you pay for so I will definitely be ordering takeout often. Sometimes it just feels good to indulge."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I enjoy the chorizo and eggs served with a warm tortilla. More food than I can eat! They make their own chorizo! Also enjoy the roast pork sandwich and the roast beef sandwich. Staff is very friendly. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Local - check, Organic - check, Cool vibe - check, Close to home - check, they got it all for me.  This place is truly a hidden gem right in Desert Ridge.  I met the Owners when I was there really nice people putting out a good product.  Honestly, not one bad thing on the menu and yes the sweet potato tots are awesome!  They even have Organic Beers....heaven"}
{"text":"Outstanding adobo tacos; breakfast quesadilla with chicken sausage was also great! May come back tomorrow..."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito with chorizo keeps me coming back again and again. For lunch try the Kahlua pork sandwich. If you're not into that they always have specials and many other tasty options. The service is great too (unless they're slammed). We typically avoid that by sitting at the bar if necessary. Otherwise they have a chill patio... Try it out!"}
{"text":"Only been here one time so far, and I suppose I'd go again, if I were in the area and it were convenient, but I don't feel the need to make any kind of special effort to return.  My husband had a doc appt in the neighborhood so I went in search of coffee in the meantime.  I found Tryst Cafe and decided to go to it instead of Starbucks, which was slammed,  next door.  Good decision, I think, even if it did cost more.  The Friday morning line and crowd at Starbucks was quite insane.

I ordered the Tryst Benedict.  It was kind of like eggs benedict but with a mild Anaheim pepper cream sauce, mozzarella, spiced ham, tomatoes, poached eggs and spinach (I had it without the ham and there was no spice heat, just flavor, which is good because I don't handle spicy). The coffee was good and strong and service was great. It was a little spendy for breakfast for one person, though ($18.42 for the plate and a coffee so $24 including  tip), but for a once in awhile outing, I guess that's okay.

Other points:  

First impression:  music was way too loud both inside and out.   I was here on a Friday morning at around 9:15 am -- there were only two other diners when I arrived, but by the time I left, the patio was full (about 10 or so other diners); and added to the din of people talking, it was disturbingly noisy, like going to a night club, except I really just wanted to have a nice, mellow morning drinking coffee and enjoying the surprisingly nice weather, since the patio was covered and sheltered from the morning sun, being on the West side of the building.   There's just no way to chillax when it's that noisy (and unnecessarily so), though.

The sweet potato tots were fine.  They're deep fried, crisp (how I like 'em, actually), tater tots that are smaller than regular tater tots and made from sweet potatoes.  They're good, but nothing that I think is remarkable -- I don't normally think of tater tots for breakfast, but if that sounds good to you, you'll probably really like them.

All in all, good food, great service, nice atmosphere except for the too loud music, which made people have to talk too loudly to be heard over it, but a little too spendy.  Would I recommend Tryst Cafe?  Sure, if you're in the area, have to have organic food, have the money and happen to find it convenient.  Will I return?  Sure, if I'm in the area, feel like I need organic food (I go through phases), have the money (again, I go through phases) and happen to find it convenient."}
{"text":"From service to food, everything was amazing!!!! Best Buffalo chicken wrap I have ever eaten in my entire life! The French fries were also delicious. Great size portions. My boyfriend and I love this place! Our server was also wonderful, great on keeping up with refills!"}
{"text":"This review is for my most recent visit to Tryst.  Normally, I would probably leave a 4 to 5 star review (and maybe i will reevaluate and update this review on our next visit)

The point of this review is not to highlight their food.  Honestly, their food is top notch for the most part.  Never any complaints here.  My review is to highlight an over served regular customer who made every other customer uncomfortable who walked into this establishment.  I understand that servers cannot control the behavior of their patrons, but to allow a customer to be beligerantly rude and disrupt others is not good business.  Some servers seemed to play his little game and egg him on.  Other servers seemed agitated with his antics but didn't do anything to handle the situation (and honestly I do not expect them to, I expect a manager to.)

A huge part of how I choose where to dine is due to the ambiance of the place.  If I feel uncomfortable, chances are I will not be going back.  If my girlfriend is uncomfortable, chances are we are never going back.

If this man wasn't there and/or was dealt with in a proper fashion, this would have been a lovely dining experience at a restaurant I have been to many times."}
{"text":"Tryst Cafe is a great place for brunch and mimosas after a Zumba workout!!! My instructor and I go there all the time. The wait staff is always great."}
{"text":"Tryst Cafe is perfection! Went here for my birthday dinner with the family. 

The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and wine pairing. 
The Ahi wonton cups hummus trio, and desert ridge summer rolls are amazing as a starter. 

For dinner I had the turkey burger, the brie cheese and strawberry jam are perfection to this burger. 

For dessert, I love the creme brule, and bread pudding are my favorites. 

I love this place and will continue eating here. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"So good! I had the best veggie omelet everrr! My kids loved the pancakes (there huge). And my husband really enjoyed his egg sandwich. Freshly squeezed oj was delicious."}
{"text":"After reading all great review devoted to tray this place for breakfast, they most likely has great food unfortunately for me I have to walk a way as my coffee was lighter than tea, they tray to explained that this is \"organic\" but seriously this is not a coffee"}
{"text":"Went twice in one week the breakfast was SO good!  Through plate sharing I tried the Tryst Omelet (yum), Pancakes (YUM!), Belgian Waffle (YUMMY!), Pecan Crusted French Toast (OMG YUMMY!), Yogurt parfait (meh and overpriced!), and Pecan Smoked Bacon cooked to perfection...not too greasy, too limp or too crispy!  I will definitely return again and again.  The atmosphere is laid back; took the 9-year-old on the 2nd trip and she fit right in- definitely cool for a family outing, a girl's breakfast or perhaps just a mimosa or two.  I'm a major foodie so it's RARE for me to rate 5-stars... please know that 4 stars is excellent in my book (5 is reserved for those extremely rare out-of-the-country tasting authentic- they just flew the food in type foods)  but as for Tryst, I will be back again and again!  Totally worth it and the price is decent!"}
{"text":"When Tryst initially opened I was so excited there was a good breakfast joint near my house, unfortunately the quality of the food and service is hit or miss. The service there can tends to be either absolutely terrible or spot on. Last time I was there the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes after we arrived so we had to wait, IMO, too long to order our food. The food itself took 45 minutes to arrive. I am giving it and extra star because some of their food is pretty yummy, like the Monte Cristo & Huevos Rancheros."}
{"text":"YUM! 
I had breakfast here last weekend. The patio is a great place to enjoy the fresh air. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. I started with the organic bloody mary. It was not my favorite. The skewer had cheese on it that tasted like refrigerator, yuck. 
The meal was much better. I ordered the veggie omelet and switched my side to the sweet potato tots based on previous reviews. The tots were delish. They were crispy and not greasy. The omelet was perfectly cooked, I asked for no oil and they made it perfectly. 
I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We tried Tryst Cafe for the first time today.  
If you like organic food with more of a raw food menu you will enjoy this Cafe.  
They have a nice selection of flavored iced teas and three different smoothies to order which compliment the dinner menu nicely.  
I had the beef burger with their sauce, lettuce, grilled tomato and buffalo mozz cheese.  It was very nice.
Beef was tasty, bun was grilled on the inside but nice and soft on the outside.  Cheese was just hot enough to melt.  Fries were hot and crispy.  
The only issue I had with the burger was the tomatoes which were grilled and put on the burger was a tomato cut in half, so the first bite I took the tomato fell out.  But, the grilled flavor added to the burger so I cut the tomato up and put it back inside the bun!
My husband had the talapia tacos and a side of black beans.  He said the tacos were tasty but the beans had \"no flavor\".  Well, at an organic restaurant this sometimes happens, but you can still add a little garlic or chili flavoring and be organic!  
We had the cupcake trio for dessert.  Six dollars for three cupcakes which were very \"mini\" at best.  I think a more fair price would have been about four dollars considering the size of the cupcakes.  
Our waitress was very good and attentive and gave good recommendations. 
I feel the decor is more upscale New York loft which we really enjoyed but the number of children running around and talking loud kind of ruined our night out.  
If we return we would probably both order the beef burger."}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix and needed a relaxed, healthy cafe to start the day. Nice outdoor patio space to enjoy a cup of coffee and breakfast. The egg white kale omelet is top notch with delicious, fresh ingredients. Staff was very friendly.  It's a must!"}
{"text":"Average food, bad service...sweet potato tots are ok but didn't live up to all the hype."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the neighborhood and were looking for a great breakfast joint! The Yelp ratings don't lie, this place was great! Love all of the organic and fresh ingredients. Breakfast was awesome, can't wait to try for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with the family and the choices are amazing. I try ordering something new all the time. Top three breakfast items are Eggs Benedict's, breakfast burrito and French Toast. My he fact they heave gluten free options help my diabetic grand father have more options."}
{"text":"I miss living up north and being just a hop, skip and a jump away from Tryst. Unfortunately, I moved to south Scottsdale and haven't made the trek to Desert Ridge for a few months. 

I typically visited Tryst for brunch on the weekends. They make a mean spicy Bloody Mary complete with bacon slices and a cube or two of white cheese, along with the traditional olives, celery, lemon and lime. Whoever said they got an ungarnished Bloody Mary must have just been there on an off day?

For lunch or dinner, the ahi salad is really tasty, and a pretty good value at $13. They don't skimp on the portion of ahi. They used to have this amazing turkey burger on a pretzel bun with Brie and some kind of strawberry or raspberry jelly, but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. The Kahlua pork sandwich is yummy too. 

I brought my mom here for lunch one time when she was in town visiting me and she loved it. She's really big on anything organic or locally sourced, and Tryst is both. 

Hopefully I'll have an excuse to venture up north sometime soon and I can indulge again."}
{"text":"Have had lunch here on several occasions, including business lunches.  The service  is consistently great, the food is organic and reasonably priced, and they even offer gluten free or vegetarian for many of their dishes.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a well prepared, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time at Tryst (first time for Breakfast) and I have to say that this place is awesome. Great presentation and great food. I got the Kalua Pork Sandwhich, which comes on a Brioche Bun, and ordered it with a side of Sweet Potato Tots. My wife ordered the Shrimp Tacos, and they were both so tasty. We also had 3 other people in our party and their food looked equally amazing. Will be back, and will be ordering this to-go in the near future!"}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer for several years but lately their service has gone completely down. The waitstaff is very pushy, they do not do anything to control the crowds coming in (who wants people standing all around you with their asses in your face as you eat?) and the manager/owner always seems to be scolding at people."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST REVIEW.

Whenever we do an overnighter in PHX, we try to make a point of going to Tryst for breakfast.  We actually found this place via Yelp and have been very pleased with our experiences there.  

We like several things about this restaurant.  The food and drinks are very tasty.  My 6 year-old LOVES their pancakes and bacon.  She also always gets their strawberry smoothie.  My wife and I like their coffee as it is deep but not acidic.  We have had their Breakfast Sandwich, Tryst Breakfast, and Eggs Benedict before and have been satisfied.  We also love their staff who are laid-back and polite.   They especially are good to our kids (3 and 6) and are really easy going about splitting smoothies between the two of them or getting an extra slice of toast for one of the kids.  They go the extra mile to make it a great experience for the parents and the kids.  I always leave a generous tip to show my appreciation to them.  

I only have two words of caution.  The meals tend to be a bit on the oilier side.  Second, their price point is a bit higher than other places ($45 post-tax and pre-tip) for two adults and two kids meals.  I happen to not mind the price because of the great experience we always get."}
{"text":"Just tried it out Sunday afternoon. Halfy Hour is definately the way to go. I had the bbq pork sandwich with fries (they no longer have potato salad on the menu) The meat was very tender, the coleslaw topper is always a nice touch. The sauce had a bit more tangyness that I prefer, but was a solid sandwich. I wlll return to try something different. I think happy (halfy hour is 3-6pm everyday."}
{"text":"I just recently tried Tryst Caf√© and was very pleasantly surprised! I got the Hawaiian breakfast (pork, cabbage, two eggs, and I subbed sweet potato tots for the jasmine rice). SO delicious. The restaurant is clean, the wait staff is friendly and the service is great.

I went in today for the second time and ordered the same dish which did not disappoint. When I tried paying, their credit card system was glitching so I waited a little while for them to figure it out. They provided a $10 gift card for the inconvenience, which was totally unnecessary but extremely thoughtful. I will be back to try something on their dinner menu."}
{"text":"After one less than pleasing breakfast here, we won't be returning.  We started out with a couple of bloody marys which were made \"extra spicy\" as we requested and which were quite good, offering an interesting twist as they were made with cucumber vodka.  Had we ceased to order anything more, I may have wished to venture back to Tryst, but unfortunately, we did not quit while we were ahead.

We both ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which were described as having an Anaheim chile sauce.  What arrived was a plate covered in some sort of goo that tasted like cheap Velveeta cheese sauce that had been somehow modified to give it a filmy texture.  The sauce was absolutely flavorless and made the entire dish, including the tortilla chips, into a soggy mess.  While I don't often do this, the meal was so awful that I truly couldn't eat it and asked the server to take it away.  The manager promptly came over and offered to get me a substitute entree.  He left me with a menu and he and the remainder of the staff (there were not all that many servers working as the place is very small) seemed to disappear.  After 10 minutes, I was still waiting to place my order for my substitute breakfast.  By this time, my husband had finished the portion of his meal that he intended to eat, which was not all that much either, given that he's made the same mistake in ordering the huevos rancheros that I did.  I finally managed to flag down a server and ordered the veggie omelet which the server told me came with toast and gave me a choice of bread.  Twenty minutes later, my omelet arrived sans toast.  When I inquired about the toast the server looked confused and went to the kitchen where it apparently took another ten minutes to toast some bread.  The omelet itself was very disappointing as they had sauteed the vegetables in an excessive amount of grease and then cooked the egg separately so that the greasy veggies were simply set between the folded egg rather than being cooked into the omelet as normally done.  Additionally, a slice of unmelted cheddar cheese had been placed with the veggies.  Definitely one of the worst veggie omelets I have ever had.  With so many other restaurant options to choose from, there certainly is no reason to come to Tryst."}
{"text":"We returned the other day and, remembering how salty the monte cristo was, I asked if I could sub some of their amazing bacon for the traditional ham. Our waitress was happy to oblige my request (no upcharge) and the sandwich was amazing. The gently sweet, smoky bacon flavor was a much better complement to the buttery gruyere than the salty ham. Try it with the bacon - perfection!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating at this new place for me.   I googled best places to eat in Desert Ridge for breakfast and this came up.  Food looked good, a bit bland but perhaps that's because it was organic?  The coffee was too light.  I told the waitress 2x and she just basically brushed it off as \"it's made by a machine\"  and \"ok i'll let them know\" on the 2nd comment about the coffee.  i held it up (glass coffee cup) and it looked like tea!  Argh!!"}
{"text":"I give the food 4 stars..very very good. You can really taste the difference eating fresh organic food vs the processed food you get in most restaurants. The patio is also 4 stars...very relaxing and the chairs are sooo comfortable. This was our second time at Tryst, the first time was for Mother's Day.

Unfortunately, this time, the service, although friendly was really poor. Our waiter was also the bar tender, so I tried to give the benefit of the doubt, but we were just..forgotten. It took nearly 20 minutes to get the check, and that was after I went to the register to ask for it. Then he forgot to come to the table to pick up the card, so I went back to the register to settle. He processed it incorrectly, so that was another 10 minutes.

We also appreciate the gluten free options, but I don't know if we'll go back here again."}
{"text":"Review based on breakfast only:
It was a decently busy morning I'd say, but 2 of us were seated and greeted right away.
Our waitress was very sweet and friendly.
Food came out quickly and was delicious!
Eggs Benedict and an Egg White Omelet(sort of a custom order) were perfect! 

The vibe in this place is clean, organized, and unique. 

It's not a \"cheap\" place, but I firmly believe in: You get what you pay for. Highly recommended place for breakfast, at least, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried out the Tryst Cafe after a hike Sunday morning and I must say, I am so excited to have a new \"close to home\" breakfast spot. The food was fantastic, in fact, I am still dreaming about my Hawaiian Breakfast, which I will hopefully be having again this weekend! 

The service was very good, they even made accommodations for us to sit outside at a special table because we had our dog after the hike. Since this place is so close to home, I know we will be back often! Hopefully others will see how great it is and make sure it stays in business. The menu is unique, yet familiar. Go to Tryst cafe and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service- good food- nice to have healthy breakfast options. 
Our waiter was very accommodating and patient with our 3 kids."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place - not any more. Hair found in two of four of our breakfast dishes. Food was cold. Biscuits and gravy had weird flavor. Place is Not as clean now either. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was good, rather than scrambled eggs chunks in a tortilla, it was a thick scrambled egg sheet which assured for lots of egg in each bite.  The choriza was a little on the spicy side.  I also had it with a side of fruit which consisted of the typical melon offerings of canteloupe and honey dew."}
{"text":"I feel like Napoleon Dynamite whenever I eat here. Get your own tots! Always have a good breakfast/brunch never tried dinner here. Good omelet's and great totts. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Tryst cafe has interesting, unique and healthy food.  We dined here twice while visiting the area.  Dinner was so good that we returned for breakfast.  The Hawaiian Breakfast was amazing!  It is a bowl of perfectly seasoned pork, rice and cabbage, topped with eggs. The server suggested soy sauce and sriracha - perfection!  If you're not feeling so adventurous, they have traditional eggs and pancakes too. We will definitely come back to Tryst Cafe next time we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was great but something has happened. New chef? Owner? Same menu but different recipes. Battered and deep fried onions on a steak salad...yuck!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for breakfast, its always busy. I really like the food and the fact that they accomodate you if there is somethong you dont like. 

Parking is always a hastle only because its a shopping plaza next to many other businesses. Otherwise, def recomebd to others!"}
{"text":"I love the fresh, organic offerings of this restaurant! The mimosa with the fresh orange juice really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite and respite from the heat. The place was pretty busy, but luckily there was a table inside under the fan. Our waitress was very gracious, helpful and attentive. In fact, all of the staff seemed very polite and full of friendliness and smiles. 

We ordered a burger to share since we were in a rush and asked for the sweet potato tots to be served as soon as they were ready, which we happily we received and devoured moments later. The turkey burger was different in a good way, brie and strawberry jam on a fluffy brioche bun. The savory sweet combination was a winner. The turkey was also tender and moist, overall a great spin on a turkey burger that I was grateful to try."}
{"text":"Here's the thing with Tryst,I felt like having an affair on Tryst the instant I split from this place! 
I spent the better part of a 20 spot and still left  unsatisfied and unsatiated.
 I ordered a portabello sandwich with side salad the food was good but that's it; with tip and  for what I got it would be great out of the sack for closer to a 10 spot out the door.. 
Tryst,,,,well that' s a big name to live up to!"}
{"text":"Tryst is good. Food is food. Location is good. It's just...good. I have yet to find a dish that I crave the taste of later. I only visit when in the area and with with someone that wants to try it out. Nothing bad, just nothing amazing. Service is always slow."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 3 1/2 but I'm feeling generous tonight so I'll round it up. 

I have to start by saying that I was very hungry when I came so I expected things to  hit my taste buds hard, but no. With the exception of their organic margarita which was fab & very refreshing, I had a Bloody Mary & their steak salad both of which were just kinda fine- good enough. Everyone I went with said their food was good but no rave reviews... except for that margarita! All in all, I would go again because service was great but would give something else on the menu a try."}
{"text":"Just had steak, bacon & sweet potato tots (& hot sauce!!) for breakfast, Scott had the Hawaiian Breakfast - loved it!!! Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch and were all pleased with our meals.  I ordered the Tryst Omelet and it was amazing.  The pesto was fresh and the sweet potato tots were pretty amazing.  They offered several gluten free options, which is great fo rme too.  

We sat outside though and there were tons of flys.  Not sure how to prevent that, but it was very annoying.  

Our waitress was realy nice and knew her stuff.  

Parking was also pretty horrible.  It took about 10 minutes to find a spot."}
{"text":"Tonight I met some friends here to have a couple drinks and dinner. I had the organic pad Thai and it was ok. The burger my friend ordered looked amazing ! Can't wait to try that or the salmon next time. The shrimp was really fres h as well. I am giving them 5 stars because of the organic coconut rum drink. Wow!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch because it was close to work and I had a coupon... The service was terrific!  I sat at the counter and the staff were very attentive and courteous.  The place was moderately busy at lunch and had a nice, comfortable atmosphere.  Great wifi reception!  I had high hopes.

Frankly, the food was nothing spectacular. Got a turkey burger and sweet potato tots.  Everything was okay; I can't complain... But the lunch menu is super small and I figured food quality would make up for the limited selection, but the food was just...... Eh.  

Anyway the servers were awesome so if I had the chance I'd recommend to the owners to add some selections and maybe new recipes?  

Very \"gluten-free\" friendly, if you're looking for that..."}
{"text":"I met my brunch buddy there recently and really wanted to love this place.  We went on a Sunday and the parking lot was just packed because there is also a Sbuck's just a couple of doors over.  There was a line when I arrived but BB was already seated.  She had a Bloody Mary and an omelette; I had oatmeal with fresh fruit (boring, I know but our waiter was not the least bit helpful when asked for his favorite menu item).  I guess I'm pretty spoiled by the places in MY neck of the woods but this would not be a \"destination\" restaurant for me as it's several miles from my home.  I didn't think the menu was especially creative and the service/access was not stellar.  The best I can muster is a \"not horrible\"."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I was excited to find a place with so many Gluten free dishes.  The latte was cold even though I ask for it extra hot. the gluten free bread used in the french toast was two inches thick, dry and the food was cold. the syrup was cold. the tater tots cold. the portions ok but the food was horrible and service not any better. Cost very high for food not fit to eat.....and I didn't. Never will I return."}
{"text":"Cold food. Long wait. My mom's birthday breakfast :(. Nice waiter, zeroed out our bill."}
{"text":"We had seen the good reviews and TV program on \"Check Please, Az\" about this cafe. We also have a need for gluten free and organic. However, our overall experience was lackluster, at best, and honestly, our assessment of this Cafe is that is \"smoke and mirrors\". 

When a restaurant advertises itself as \"organic\", there needs to be a requirement that said restaurant, in our opinion, offers a certain percentage of it's menu as organic. We found that little, if any, of the offerings at Tryst Cafe were organic on the day we visited. Not only were the organic offerings virtually non-existent, but GMO's were running rampant, and gluten free offerings were confusing, at best. For example, there was the mention of gluten free French Fries on the menu, but when the owner brought us the clearly battered fries, she cautioned us that they were NOT gluten Free. Then our server comes by and mentions that the fries have NO breading, and are just potatoes, but \"a concern might be that they are fried in the same fryers\" as the wheat stuff. What is a diner to think? What is a diner to do?

That said, we had traveled great distance to Tryst Cafe from out of the area, and with reasonable expectations for an \"organic, gluten free\" restaurant. However we both became ill following our experience, and one of us has celiac disease and can have NO gluten. It seemed pretty clear that there had been gluten ingested.  Not a positive experience in the least! We will not be returning to Tryst."}
{"text":"I love Tryst because it clean eating, whenever I feel like something healthy and easy, Tryst is always on my list. The fish taco's are amazing. The presentation is always fantastic and super tasty. The service sometimes on a busy night is a little slow and could be improved a little but I'm always willing to wait as they are really friendly. There also could be a little more range on the menu."}
{"text":"I work nearby and thought I should try this place..small, cute,   interesting decor.....to say the least the breakfast is amazing.   My favorite place for breakfast. Other times of day I have not gone yet."}
{"text":"Foods unbelievable they have  a lot of gluten free options the owner is extremely nice and I'm very happy we chose this place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Regretfully, Tryst Cafe fell thru twice with me, prompting me to write  my first ever restaurant review.  I am still siting there as I write this. 
Picked for location and advertising of special food i went with wife and kid in March to find the eclectic menu not justified by the delivery. Goat cheese salad only very mildly contaminated by goat cheese and very little dressing, large parts of main course were seriously cold and asparagus heavily overcooked. Service friendly but inefficient that day (as a European I do not expect the usual American speed of refilling, but this one was very slow and unattentive) After I put my card for payment, the check grew by 10% as they had forgotten to add a drink I had. Would have liked to be alerted of that vs. finding out myself.
To their credit they offered discount voucher for next time which i rejected with my offer to give them a second chance. 
Just did and have regretted it. Sticky and wobbling  table outside, and my medium-rare tenderloin was solidly well done. Taste of sauce and presentation very nice, but there seems to be an issue with care in the kitchen - even though the place 70% empty. 
Maybe on the less elaborate menu items they fare better (burgers and sandwiches)  ..... but I will never know. Frank J"}
{"text":"Tryst Cafe served us the WORST lunch!  

The guacamole was dark green, but we tried it anyway (bad mistake as it was spoiled with a bad aftertaste).  When my girlfriend's portabella sandwich was served the guacamole spread on it was black and the portabella was smaller and hidden under a tomato slice...The bun was twice the size of everything except for the lettuce leaf.  I then noticed the guacamole on my grilled cheese was also black!

When I told the waitress, she offered to bring us a new guacamole to go; obviously, not solving for the black guacamole on the sandwiches.  I said, no thanks, but someone in the back needs to know guacamole is not supposed to be black.  She told me she will tell someone in the back but \"nicely\" as that is how she is paid.  I was shocked and told her, I am the person paying for the food, so you should worry about us because you are not going to make any money off of me.  She went to the back and then came out saying they were making fresh guacamole (didn't do our sandwiches any good)!  

After we picked what was edible, she brought us the fresh guacamole, I refused to try it, but my girlfriend did...She said it had no flavor (except a crushed avocado with tomatoes."}
{"text":"What a mess. Food was ok, but service was horrific. They didn't see my order on the ticket so everyone at our table got food but me. Then they dropped it. My food finally came after everyone else was done eating. It was decent, but not worth the extra deluxe wait. 

They didn't clear the table. Someone spilled syrup and they didn't wipe it up. Had to flag her down for refills or anything we needed, if we could find her. I'm writing this at the table waiting for them to finally take our check. I knew I'd have time. We joked our server had a second job at another store nearby because she kept disappearing for so long. 

Ah, she just took our credit card so we can finally go. Was worried we would still be for dinner.

Go elsewhere. This place doesn't have its act together at all."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the hubs this morning at Tryst as we haven't been in a while.  Wasn't to busy, got a table right away and proceeded to order.  They have some of the best coffee around, so we started with that.  Hubs ordered the Hawaiian Bowl with a pancake on the side and I just ordered the regular two egg breakfast.  As we are huge foodies, we are always stalking other peoples food, and saw quite a few breakfast quesadilla's being served.  A few minutes later someone came to our table with a breakfast quesadilla and said they had made an extra one by mistake, and would we like to try it on the house???  SCORE!!!!  It was really good and fresh and the tomatillo salsa they served with it was divine.  Our server Rachel told us later that she saw us eying the tasty treat, and so when they asked her if anyone would like one on the house, she said of course, I know the perfect couple!!!  Great breakfast, great customer service, we won't wait as long to go back!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast! Great atmosphere and service. Cute place. Try it!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.
We have been to this location many times and were always pretty happy with the food & service. But this time was awful! Management was terrible. There was a new manager that I had never seen before and she was not helpful. The food was bad and service was worse. Do not get the corned beef! It was like leather. I could not even eat it. It did not come with everything the special said it would come with. The price was outrageous for the terrible quality. I felt sick after trying to eat it.
We were given a $5 coupon for the next visit rather than an apology & compensation. We will never return!
Also- BEWARE if you need gluten free."}
{"text":"Great spot on No. Phoenix. We went for brunch. Lots of organic and gluten-free options. Many options for any type of eater.  We both had different versions of the Monte Cristo sandwich. Delicious! Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The food was very good! No wait when we went! I felt like it needed be mopped. I have heard from others wait is not great but Natalie was great."}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday with my boyfriend because we decided to try all of the lesser known cafes in the phoenix area. i read some of the yelp reviews and was wary since most talked of the 'organic' foods. for some reason, i always believed organic to be those extremely healthy foods that taste like dirt. luckily, i left this place enlightened of my ignorant knowledge of this type of food.
  we arrived as the sun was going down on one of phoenix's very seldom rainy days and decided to sit outside on the covered patio since the temperature wasn't killer. for being outside, it was still very nice quality seating, i.e. not the regular 'patio furniture' of most cafes. the inside was bustling, but we experienced a very quiet atmosphere since no one else venture to the outside area.
  After perusing the menu for some time, and asking a wandering waiter, who seemed very knowledgeable about the menu, about the specials, My boyfriend got a burger with fries and i decided to go out  of my box and try the veggie burger, substituting the organic salad with french fries.
  Our food arrived promptly but i was dismayed to find that an organic salad was still my side. However, being in the restaurant business myself, i decided not to complain and just give it a go. i am sure glad i did! the salad was delicious with a vinaigrette dressing that was not as overbearing as many ive had. i actually enjoyed the mix of greens, carrots, and sweet corn. as for the veggie burger, it was the best ive ever had. the taste to me almost resembling a tortilla soup.(try it and you'll understand) i would order it regularly without a second thought, this coming from a girl who rarely ever orders anything outside a regular burger.
  That being said, my boyfriends burger was to die for. the absolute BEST burger ive had in years. the meat was cooked to order and moist. that along with the, what i believed to be strange at the time, pairing of goat cheese, pesto, and an heirloom tomato was heaven on the taste buds.
  The only downside to the meal was that i believe our waitress forgot about us after serving our food, as we never got a refill on drinks, nor did she check on us until we were ready for our check.
  overall, it was a delicious meal, and we will be going back ASAP to try more organic foods. cant believe i missed out on it for so long!"}
{"text":"I love tryst cafe! The Kaluah pulled pork sandwich was AMAZING. Their sweet potato tots are to die for. All organic and food allergy friendly! This place rocks! The service is great too!!! Very timely and nice."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. First time great food, great customer service. Sweet potatoe tots are awesome. Will return."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here for breakfast on three occasions (can't wait to nosh at lunch or dinner here sometime too), and they've killed it every time. They have an awesome menu for full gluten and gluten free people alike! I had the pecan crusted French toast (gf) and it was amazing. Crunchy, sweet, and delicious.

If you have a kiddo that doesn't like to eat-ever-take them here. My son insists he doesn't want to eat and then munches away on the bacon and pancakes kids meal. The kids meal is a very generous portion too, as are the adult meals.

The restaurant style is \"upscale casual\". You probably won't leave here without paying $10-$12 per person for breakfast, but it's well worth it. They cater to all diets: vegan, gf, dairy free, and nothing free. Plus the food is delicious, ranging from unique offerings to traditional standbys. Its hard not to come in, relax, and enjoy some good eats with family and friends."}
{"text":"Great GF options!! Thank you!
However, needs to work on service - and food could be hotter when arrives.  If your going to charge the same as Soul Cafe... Then you need to step it up!
My husband and I will try again, as location is bet convenient.   Hope for better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate here for the first time last night and we'll be back!! The food was delicious. I had the incredible burger with everything including mozz, pesto, and roasted tomato. Absolutely incredible and I was sorry when I took my last bite. Hubby had the kaluha pork sandwich and loved it. Fries were crispy and hot. Even the water was perfect (no chlorine or yucky taste if you know what I mean). Service was quick and friendly. Small place, casual, but oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was presented beautifully.  The service was good.  Kinda $$$ for breakfast/ brunch.  I ordered the grilled tuna melt. It was good, just on the fishy side.  The waitress offered to replace my meal without me even asking,  I thought that was great customer service.  I politely declined, but it was nice for her to offer."}
{"text":"Have been waiting to try this place for weeks. Cozy little cafe and a cute little porch to sip mimosas (momos') on. The tables sit very close to each other so be prepared for ease dropping, at least I know i was doing it. First off, a guy by himself was sitting there and gave the most disgusted look when he had his eggs delivered to him and they were not cooked to a hard poached style he liked. Once he left I felt better about my day 

Lets talk about booze first. Loved that they give you a little bottle of champagne to refile your momo. I loved the fresh orange juice and orange wheel. Cute touch! BF ordered some ice coffee and also enjoyed that. 

For the day, I was feeling adventurous so I ordered the Monte Kristo. Stuffed with Gruyere and fresh strawberries, I was hoping it would be battered but it was all in between to soggy pieces of french toast. I think other people will like it as I have read in other reviews but it was too bold for the morning. 

Sweet potato tots were creative and yummy. Needs some sort of dipping sauce besides ketchup. 

BF ordered and egg white veggie omlete...first off, I don't even know how that would be good, cooked anywhere. pleh. 

We left with a lot of food on our plates. This place would be safer to go with breakfast staples like eggs, and bacon or maybe go for lunch."}
{"text":"We frequent Tryst for breakfast. All their food is Organic, which is awesome for a restaurant.  They have a Hawaiian breakfast that is like nothing I have ever had. It is amazing! There sweet potato hash is to die for as well. Tryst puts a great twist on their food. Their lunch is oitstanding, as well. They have fantastic salads and sandwiches. I would suggest eating a Tryst especially over all the food chain located at Desert Ridge. I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Organic, local, and fresh ingredients are the specialty at Tryst. I have been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The food is usually well prepared and the service is fine. It is easy to eat healthy off the menu. The d√©cor and ambiance is a miss for me. It seems a bit cold and stark. It a great place for breakfast. Try the benedict."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful relaxing lunch on the patio at Tryst. My friends each had the pecan crusted French toast and I enjoyed the Ruben sandwich.  The Mango-lemon grass iced tea was phenomenal!!!    The service was great and the atmosphere was charming.   The parking can be a little challenging, but Tryst Cafe is a great alternative to all the chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Here w out of town guests who had been here before & they were disappointed because they said the food wasn't as good this time & coffee was horrific. Waitress had a little attitude as well. My food was ok. Sourdough toast wasn't very good. I've had way better for sure. Sweet potato tots were yummie tho."}
{"text":"Not sure what is up with the negative rewiews, but this place is delishhhhhh. Whenever me and my girlfriends go out, we stop at tryst cafe. The food is always very fresh, and their sweet potato tots are to die for. I think people need to understand you are paying more for quality. If you want something less go eat at denny's. I will always be a loyal customer to tryst cafe :-))"}
{"text":"Would have given this a zero if I could.  We went to dinner here with a group of 6.  The place was pretty full for a Monday and there was a band playing that was very good.  We got drink orders, then after that nothing.  We waited nearly 45 minutes before finally getting our orders taken.  No drink refills during that time either.  The place isn't huge and they did seem understaffed, but even still there is no excuse for that long of a wait, not even coming over to check on us during that time.  After being there for over an hour and still no food we walked out.  Absolutely the worst service I've ever had in my life.  First time I've ever had to walk out of a restaurant.  Definitely will never be going back!"}
{"text":"Tried tryst for lunch on 12/28/2012. The food was ok; appetizer ordered was not submitted. It's one of those places that if I'm conveniently in the area, then I would visit otherwise would not make a special trip just for the food."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Love the kale goat cheese omelet and the awesome coffee! I love this place."}
{"text":"When you compare Tryst to the other fine dining restaurants in the Desert Ride area (and there are plenty of them) it is easy to expect nothing but the most pretentious, high-scale, over-priced establishment you can fathom. 

Afterall, this isn't Scottsdale, it's Desert Ridge, where the REAL class is. 

Keeping in mind that Tryst is a family-owned and operated restaurant, their ambiance and decorum is on scale with the Yard House and Rock Bottom Brewery that is found across the way. The service, while typically not the quickest despite the cozy restaurant size, is largely attentive and ensures an excellent dining experience. 

But lets get real, we are here for the food. It's unique, there is a vast array of options for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner, including gluten-free and organic options for the majority of the menu. If you are really worried about pricing, In and Out Burger is on the corner and I am sure can accommodate your budget. You are buying a truly unique and authentic plate that can't be found anywhere around the Valley. 

This includes liquor and beer selections that are difficult to find anywhere but San Francisco and New York. I've had the pleasure of dining at Tryst for 3-4 times per month for the past six months and can say with conviction that everything on the menu is worth trying. Especially the sweet potato tots, they are a great sidekick to anything on their menu or as a standalone. 

You won't be disappointed with Tryst, and if you are, you were dining at the wrong place all along."}
{"text":"Food was great! Tryst omelette was amazing! Eggs Benedict was great! Just a little pricey! Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic customer service, great HEALTHY food, and an ample drink selection. I will be coming back for sure! Brianna not only remembered us, but our food and drink orders as well, and this was only our second time in. They definitely know how to make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the ambiance because a friend brought take-out.  My turkey burger was delicious and my companions enjoyed their sandwiches (tuna melt and pulled pork).  My fries might have been tasty had they not been limp and sad (in comparison to the turkey burger which was still quite warm).  Our side of pita and hummus was disappointing.  The pita was so old it had turned into extra chewy lavosh.  Eating one piece gave my jaws a workout.  The hummus itself was super extra mediocre.  There was something off about it.  

I may try Tryst again but I certainly won't make a special effort."}
{"text":"Food was really good. You could tell it's good quality. Our service was not so good.  Workers are friendly but were having bad day on service."}
{"text":"Greta food. Prices are a bit high comparatively.  Atmosphere is laid-back. Nice little patio"}
{"text":"Pretty damn great, I must say.  Went as a rec' from another foodie who told me about their happy/half hour (whole menue is 50% off from 3-6pm), can't refuse that!  When we arrived I was pleased with the casual atmosphere and good service.  Local, organic fare that's BPA + GMO free + gluten free as well? Definitely a big plus in my book. 

So far I've been twice and haven't been disappointed either time.  Menu items I've had are: the caprese, the chicken caesar salad (the balsamic dressing on the chicken is to die for!), the green beans,  the ahi salad, the pulled pork sandwich (a lil' too saucy for my tastes but good nonetheless, the cheeseburger, the beef filet, and the shrimp tacos (shrimp was very fresh, the side of white rice was kinda weird.)  Yes, we like to go big or go home. :9

I definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for good + fresh food around 3-6pm.  I don't think I would go anytime other than happy/half hour though as the food isn't good enough to  validate $16 for three shrimp tacos, $12 for a caesar salad, or $19 for a thin filet."}
{"text":"Tryst was awesome.  Clean, fresh ingredients, and very friendly and attentive service!  I ordered blueberry pancakes, which were customized to include the berries \"no problem!\"  I also asked for a size of chorizo which was brought out \"no problem!\"  The coffee was fantastic and the food quality was very high - extremely fresh and tasty.  Nice presentation too which never hurts!  Also, my coffee was never empty - more points!  I'd rather support local cafes like Tryst over a chain any day of the week.  Tryst definitely has my vote!

Overall review: Clean, great service, great food, great ambience."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to Tryst. This is a option for light and healthy meals. Almost all food and drinks are organic.

I ordered the Brussel Sprout and Kale salad which also had blueberries, dried cranberries, almonds and caramelized onion. The dressing was a campaign vinaigrette and then I added grilled chicken. The salad did lack seasoning, but since the Brussel Sprouts and Onions were warm, the melted the blueberries a little bit which I really enjoyed. My mom ordered the Grilled Chicken and Goat Cheese Salad and switched out the dressing for champagne vinaigrette as well. She enjoyed hers as well. 

If you have kids, this is a great place to take them. They have terrific kids meals for breakfast and lunch and he perfect portions. 

The atmosphere was cute, but it is small instead so if you have a party of 4 or more you will most likely being sitting at the bar or on their shaded and fanned patio. 

Next time I'm in North Phoenix, I'll be back for a different salad or wrap."}
{"text":"went twice. both times sucked. frozen vegan muffins. yuck. cheap turkey wrap and charging you 10$??? gross"}
{"text":"Just what I needed, great place. Cage free eggs , Kale , spinach omelets , fresh berries and chicken sausage. Ill be going back all week.. oh and almond milk for coffee"}
{"text":"Yes, 5 stars when you compare this place to any other place in the area, or in Phoenix for that matter.  Best customer service I have encountered in Scottsdale, PERIOD. I took an associate there on good Yelp reviews and it was in the area, he too was as impressed with the service, he will be mentioning this visit in his next lecture on RETAIL CUSTOMER SERVICE for the specialty coffee industry.   The Ahi salad I had was excellent, and the sweet potato tots are great!  Looking forward to getting back there for dinner!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the pros which is their food.  They have really good food and use organically grown and local produce. For that reason alone we continue to eat there. Unfortunately, we always order take out and about 2 out of 5 times our order will be wrong.  They never review or check your order so it is frustrating when you get home and they messed up your wife's order.  So now I make sure they check it with me before I leave. 

Food is great, but the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Affordable and has fun and neat presentation in a timely manner. Very laid back casual place for family and friends. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"so .. we got here and it was crazy busy !!!! we had to wait for about 15minutes . i was waiting and talking to 1 of the 3 of us and mentioned maybe while we wait we can have a mimosa ... and boom the lady behind the bar heard me and quickly got us our mimosas !!! -- our food was great . they did get 2 orders wrong with the extra things we requested but were very quick again about fixing it !!! they let us enjoy a bottomless mimosa brunch (which we had no idea about until they mentioned it !) food was great -- the customer service was SPECTACULAR and they made us feel welcomed -- note to Tryst staff WE WILL BE BACK !!!! fair warning :) !!! thank you for a GREAT Sunday brunch !!!!"}
{"text":"We walked over from the HIE and was looking for a somewhat healthy options for breakfast.  Tryst did not disappoint.  He both had the steel cut oats and they were fantastic.  We did split the sweet potato tots since we love sweet potato anything and they were really tasty.
The waitress was very friendly and we enjoyed her service.
Decor and food presentation we modern and welcomed."}
{"text":"Service was just not good at all ... 
It sucks how you get seated first and the party that got seated after gets service first . Well let's me know if you a blue collar work do eat here . They cater to white collar. So I give a one star because I'm just tired of this shit ...."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch today, and we were so disappointed.  We ordered the steak and eggs, and the only thing good about the dish was the egg.  The sauce has been microwaved and had a grease slick on top, the steak which we ordered medium, had been cut into slices before cooking, and was well done - It appeared to be from the previous night's dinner service. We ordered mimosas, and they served Barefoot bubbly at $9 a glass and it was flat. The total for two mimosas, two vodka sodas, and one order of steak and eggs that tasted like pathetic leftovers, was $60 before tip."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you want great food for dinner without being overcrowded this is the spot! The sweet potato hash is a must try."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm not really sure I can give this place a fair assessment based on food.  I came here last week and ordered the Lox and Bagels.  So the plate came out to me and it consisted of Bagel (I'm going to go on a limb and say they are not made in house) cream cheese, a pre-made product, Lox, a pre-made product (although damn good Lox) capers, pre-made product, sliced tomatoes, and sliced red onions.  So basically all they had to do is toast my bagel, and slice the onion and tomato and then just plate.  Nothing revolutionary here.  So this is why I cant really give Tryst a fair assessment.  I would have to go back and actually order something that was cooked.  It was a cute little place and has a lot of potential considering where it is located.  I have to go back again and update this review."}
{"text":"Good food, fun combinations, beautiful space. The place was packed so the staff was bit behind, but very friendly once they were able to get to me."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic place, they also boast one of only two gluten free hamburger buns I've ever tried that were actually tasty. 
The pulled pork tacos are surprisingly awesome too. Comfy place to dine in and the food is even great when ya get it to go. This is like a 4.4 rating; better stocked bar would've pushed it to a 5."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast for breakfast or lunch! It's small and casual, but a little on the pricey side. I had a great vegetable omelets at Tryst. A lot of diner type place's omelets and eggs end up having an off taste from the oil or dish used which thankfull is not the case here. Tryst's omelet is fluffy, thick, has great cooked vegetables, and enough cheese to make it filling without being greasy or heavy. The roasted potatoes served with the omelet are good."}
{"text":"We ordered the house burger, spring rolls, buffalo chicken sandwich and brie appetizer all because they were gluten free. When the food came buffalo chicken was in a wrap--NOT gluten free nor was the hamburger bun. The brie was not warm and rice crackers same as you would get at Trader Joe's, pear on side along without fig. Leaves a lot to the imagination. I don't know how they can sell these fries, besides not being GF they are breaded and disgusting. Save yourself the trouble and go to Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"Great gluten free menu, and they have kombucha!

The staff were super friendly and they were very accommodating to special requests (like my smoked salmon and scrambled egg with gluten-free toast)."}
{"text":"Soups are delicious. We had the chicken tortilla soup and the tai curry soup special. Perfect lunch to nurse my cold!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Cute little restaurant and nice breakfast/brunch menu. The bartender was sweet and helpful. The blueberry pancake was gigantic and full of blueberries. I'm glad I only ordered one! My boyfriend's breakfast sandwich looked tasty and you can't go wrong with sweet potato tots! I'm looking forward to coming back and trying one of their healthier items. My only complaint was that there was no mimosa or bloody mary deal on the weekend! But I realize you can't have everything!"}
{"text":"Tryst Cafe had delicious fresh food. 

We were visiting family in Phoenix and were recommended to go here. As a LA native, I didn't have big expectations for this place. I was pleasantly surprised. 

The restaurant itself was small but modern with a bar. There is options for outdoor/indoor seating. Food was amazing. I got the buffalo chicken wrap. I was a bit hesitant and fearful that they would glob on the buffalo sauce but it was perfectly balanced. Chicken was all breast meat, juicy and cooked to perfection. It comes with fries and they were sooo yummy. 

Breakfast is served until 2:30 and after 4:00 there are a lot of yummy looking specials like lobster mac n cheese and some yummy sounding cocktails, i don't remember. 

Price wise isn't bad. It's maybe a dollar or so higher than what I would call a deal, but at least they come with fries.

The restaurant is located in a plaza. It's a little hidden because I was standing in front of it and it took me a second to see the signage."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our friend out to lunch here before she leaves the country for a year. 

We always come during the morning for breakfast, but we wanted to try their lunch.

Good choice!

We like this place because of the fresh ingredients, no hormones and organic produce.

I got their club sandwich, it was excellent! Cheesy bread, yummy meats and veggies inside. Sweet potato tots? Too die for. 

My wife had their grilled cheese. I took a bite. Also yummy.

Our friend got a salad which looked bomb too.

Our server was very nice and the food came out fast.

Ill keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with a girlfriend and our daughters on a Saturday morning about a month ago. The service was great and the food was also. I liked that they had an iced coffee option. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joynt by far in North Pheonix.  I love the chorizo and eggs, but the meatlovers omlet, and pancakes are also some of the best I've had at any restaurant.  Ask for a side of the ancho chili sauce and pair it with the potatos or your omlet.  You won't be disappointed.  They have lunch and just recently added dinner so I'm stoked to try those soon."}
{"text":"The best blueberry pancakes I've ever had!  They are very fluffy and the fresh blueberries were amazing. Tryst has a great atmosphere and I'd highly recommend for a brunch date!"}
{"text":"I had the kale omelette... great plate and a generous portion. I would suggest cherry tomatoes so there's not two big slices of Roma's taking up filling space. Makes the omelette watery and bland. The kale should be cooked or saut√©ed in seasoning as if gave a bitter flavor. The concept is great and I like where this place is headed... just some minor tuning in taste would make it a perfect 5 star place to eat healthy food.

The service was superb and the venue itself gives a warm feeling. I will definitely come back to experiment on more dishes! Highly recommend to health motivated people and those trying to be. My new favorite spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"Went into Tryst Cafe yesterday and had high expectations which were not fulfilled.
The woman at the door and the busboys are the greatest asset of this restaurant. Very friendly and sincere. Other than that service was mediocre! We had the pineapple upside down pancakes which had no upside downness at all! No brown sugar and no sauce! Just pancakes with pineapple in them. Boring!!! Then their bacon is blanched (pre-cooked) tasted like a dog treat. Other than that the breakfast was nothing better than what I can make in my own kitchen. Raise the bar Tryst Cafe, do something worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Ive been a loyal Tryst customer for two years and the food quality and presentation has really taken a nosedive. Im disappointed and wont go back after getting sick today"}
{"text":"I work in an office nearby and we frequently go to Tryst for lunch or for breakfast for lunch. Service is always great as is everything I have tried there."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The food is great, location is a gem, the servers are friendly. I'll definitely be back. Their bloody Mary's are YUM!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch very much!  Good service and good food!  I'm looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Recommend the Hawaiian breakfast. Tucked away in a plaza, parking is tough to come by but the food makes it worth it. Friendly staff, attentive while not bothersome. Good selection of healthier options for breakfast. Next time I'm in town I'd like to try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"WOW- I was very pleasantly surprised by this wonderful restaurant--off the beaten path but worth making the trip (I guess this depends where you are coming from)  Located at Tatum off the 101 across from Desert Ridge, the Tryst Cafe has a wonderful menu, the best happy hour selection of small plates and the friendliest wait staff.  I had a 1/2 slab of fall off the bone BBQ ribs and fries (the small plate during happy hour) and the fried green beans with 4 dipping sauces.  Everything was fantastic and I plan to return very soon.  Happy hour is an everyday thing--with a deal on Sunday's.Full menu is varied and there is something for everyone.   Don't miss this treasure of a restaurant.  You will have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Just when I think I have found every delicious healthy restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale, I find another one!  I like everything about this place... The food and the ambience are the real shining stars, though.

The food was outstanding. I must have seen at least 12 things I wanted to try on the menu, but I settled on a kale salad with chickpeas, carrot, salmon, and a lime peanut vinaigrette. Pure perfection!  My friend told me she's never had a bad dish here.

I rarely write about ambience because I care more about food and service, but this restaurant set up such a chill environment that my friend and I did some very deep talking we would not normally do in public. The place has very soothing colors and design, and I even remarked to my friend that I loved the music that was playing. I don't think I've ever noticed the music in a restaurant before.

Even the waitress was chill. Friendly, but not overly so. Attentive, but not overbearing. 

Delightful all around!"}
{"text":"You must tryst my judgement and give this place a shoutout hallelujah! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my local go-to for gluten-free breakfast options. Although ordering GF toast or bagel is an up-charge, I feel it's a nice treat sometimes to go along with this wonderful turkey sausage or even a veggie omelette. I've also tried the GF pancakes and I suggest bringing a friend along to share those! Coffee with almond milk completes my meal. Breakfast is served until 2 each afternoon. 
For those who like a light bite, the Veg Spring Rolls are a great choice. At lunchtime, there are a few sandwich options, including a turkey burger & a TASTY veggie burger. For those who like a cocktail with their meal, I think the Bloody Mary is spot on. Other crowd faves include mimosas and some great wines by the glass. GOOD LOCAL EATS!"}
{"text":"Actually heard about this place a while ago. Totally forgot about it until I saw it on Yelp recently... I decided to give it a try. We went there on a Sunday around noon. The place was empty but the service was excellent. I've noticed that if places are slow, the service is also slow. Not here! The staff was pretty awesome. I went with a burger and fries and they were cooked perfect. My drink was always kept full which is the way it should be. The server checked on us often, but not at inconvenient times like you usually get elsewhere. The place had a modern feel, outdoor seating, TVs, music and a full bar. I would definitely go back and I'm sure it's a great place for drinks and socializing! Check it out for lunch someday...

The breakfast sounded amazing but we had gone there a bit late for that..."}
{"text":"I'm not a big a big fan of burgers but this was the best burger I've ever had! Great sweet potato tots and mini cupcakes too!"}
{"text":"OMG the food was amazing... or maybe I was just hungry. Either way, this place definitely hit the spot. The breakfast croissant sandwich with an egg over-easy rather than scrambled (as suggested by our wonderful waitress), and turkey sausage was absolutely mouth-watering! 

The organic coffee I still can't get over how smooth it was with a hint of sweetness (no, I didn't add anything to it). And I just couldn't resist ordering the pecan-crusted French toast with candied almonds on top -- wow! Pretty sure it was the best French toast I've had in a while. 

Tryst has become my new favorite breakfast place! :) It will be a while until I venture out to their lunch menu, but I'm sure their lunch choices are just as scrumptious as their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I ate here twice during my time in Phoenix. The first time I had the fish tacos and have to say they may have been the best I had anywhere.  My friends had the tuna melt and the chicken sandwich wrap and seemed to enjoy their meal also.  Leah was our server that night and she did a fine job taking care of us. 

The next time we went for breakfast. That was a little less exciting. Different server, not terrible but not great. Two of us this time, both ordered coffee. For those of you who cannot do dairy be aware that they charge 60 cents for soymilk to go with your coffee. From what I can tell from the receipt that means that a cup of coffee is $2.85, $3.45 if you want soymilk!  We are talking about 3 tablespoons of soymilk here folks.
So my tip is hit Starbucks for a latte first and have an immensely improved beverage experience. 

I also noticed that the waitress charged me $3.25 more for my meal than she I expected. I basically ordered the French toast sandwich without the ham or cheese and suddenly it cost a few dollars more? Luckily the waitress was willing to adjust that when I pointed it out. She also needed to be reminded to bring requested condiments to the table so I would have to say the service at this meal was less than a few nights before. 

Overall I really like this place but what seemed like some slick pricing really turned me off the second time around. If I ever go back would be pay more attention to prices when I order. If you ask for anything prepared a bit differently you may want to ask if that going to change the price as it seems here you can order something sans two of the three main ingredients and actually get charged more!"}
{"text":"My mother read about this place in the New Times so she was excited to try this place out with me.

We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a \"patio\" sorta), we chose to eat inside. 

It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a \"c\"...)

Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO. 

Last time I believe a New Times food review. Come here for some eye rolls and bland food. 

PS-Perhaps the owners should establish a \"complaint section\" away from customer's ears as it's not super impressive to complain about diners-especially when they can see/hear you."}
{"text":"We were up by Desert Ridge at lunch time, and decided breakfast sounded like a good thing for lunch...found Tryst Cafe.  It's kind of behind the Starbucks across Tatum from the shopping center.

Parking was tough, but we found a spot over by the bank.

Walked in and it looked like a pretty cool/trendy place.  Since we're in the midst of the 'shoulder season' here, we opted to eat on the patio.

I decided to try the Pecan crusted Brioche French Toast.  My buddy ordered the Chorizo.

Both were well plated.

The French toast was really nice - the pecans (generously crusted) added a nice crunch, and the syrup was good.  My friend said the Chorizo was also very good.

The coffee was kind of flat.

This is a neat place to grab a bit of breakfast (they have other stuff, too, if you're wanting a sandwich or some such).  Need to come back and explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Tryst Cafe is hidden gem located in the heart of Desert Ridge marketplace across the street in the shade plaza. It's seriously the cutest little cafe with an urban/modern feel with a full bar, and indoor/outdoor seating. It's quite the oasis. Their menu includes breakfast + lunch + dinner, happy hour, desserts, cocktails, beer, wine, coffee, and tea. They also do live music the first Monday of every month. I usually go when Flashback performs who seem to be super popular and play there often! Tryst also does a menu called \"Tryst around the World\" which is a menu inspired by different countries and is different each month (not sure if they still do that). 

Breakfast
Their Monte Cristo is super tasty! Comes with French toast which acts like the bread, ham and Swiss cheese in the middle topped with strawberry jam. Super yummy!! Especially if you're craving something sweet! Another popular breakfast fave is of course their pancakes, pecan crusted French toast, and the Hawaiian breakfast. 

Lunch
For an appetizer I love getting the hummus trio which comes with three different hummus's with your choice of pita bread, cucumbers, or BOTH!! I prefer to do cucumbers. Their caprese starter is also super delicious, but I like to add grilled chicken and saut√©ed spinach. The grilled chicken and goat cheese salad is another popular lunch option on the menu. The pears and candied walnuts ties the whole dish together. If I want to indulge the grilled cheese with either fries or sweet potato tots is out of this world!! Blended with three different cheeses with tomato and avocado. Yum!! 

Dinner 
Their salmon dish is TO DIE FOR! Comes with sweet potato hash and spinach artichoke sauce. The fish is super moist and flaky and the creamy sauce ties the whole thing together. The bistro steak is cooked to perfection! They top it with an Anaheim chili sauce which gives it a little heat, but not over powering at all. Next time I want to try their Chicken Kabobs.

Happy hour
Chicken screwers all the way! I'd  literally be super depressed if they ever took that off their menu! The cute little sliders are amazing too!! 

Service is always fantastic! Never have had a bad experience. Perfect if you're in a hurry and need a quick bite to eat (depending what day and time you go), or if you want to sit back, relax and enjoy the ambience. They typically are busy during the weekends, but you can always make a reservation by calling or on their website! I went their recently for brunch with some girlfriends and had some mimosas and appetizers. It was lovely as always! Thank you Tryst for always giving me a great experience over the past few years! I love it and so does my daughter and boyfriend. We will always be back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"My new favorite!

I've been here 4 times so far: 1 breakfast, 1 lunch, and 2 dinners.  Let me tell you- this place is A-MAY-ZING!

For breakfast, my husband got the tryst omelette and I got the pancakes.  The omelette was awesome and the pancakes were so good that my husband said he wanted to go into the kitchen and hug the cook.  The portions are hearty (I got a side of sweet potato tots as well) so I actually took home leftovers of the pancakes!  Leftovers of pancakes!  Seriously!  They were sweet and what I loved most about them is that when totally drenched with syrup, they still held together!  I hate when you end up having those few chunks of pancake that are so drenched that they fall apart and are too sweet to eat anyway.  Not here.  So amazing.  Even after pulling the leftovers out of the fridge they were still awesome.  Hot, cold, with or without syrup- you have to get the pancakes!

Had the grilled cheese for lunch and my husband got the turkey burger.  Also- SO GOOD!  The bread is perfect and the strawberry jam on the burger added an extra awesome something to the meal.

As for dinners, I highly recommend the beer battered string beans for an appetizer and the portabello sandwich.  

YUM!  YUM!  YUM!!

My husband and I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfasts.  Good range of options.  Everything looks and tastes fresh as can be.  Service quite good and pleasant seating.  Only complaint is their coffee mugs are quite small (best guess, 6 ounces or so) and you have to keep asking for more coffee"}
{"text":"Due to a food allergy our family needs gluten free options and it's so nice to find a place that does it so well!
I've been there 3 times so far and every time the food has been great...delicious and fresh.  I love the variety of options too, whether you want comfort food or something healthy they have you covered. 
The staff is wonderful too. Friendly and attentive without being annoying. The two times I called for a reservation the person on the phone has been great also."}
{"text":"Before I review a place anything less than 4 stars, I like to give it a try at least 3 times.  I have now been here 3 times and all 3 times have been mediocre. 

First off, I was super excited to have a place that offers Gluten free, Organic and healthy meals right down the street from where I live.  First time was for breakfast:  the pancakes came out under cooked, sent them back and received another batch of undercooked, as in raw goop in the middle. 

I came here for lunch the 2nd time.  I cannot remember what I had, but it took so long to bring out food out, then they messed up my friend's dish.  I will say the waitress was nice, apologized and gave all of us a coupon for a free appetizer for next time.   

The last time I came in was just for a to-go espresso drink.  Starbucks is right next door, but I do not care for their coffee.  I was told Tryst uses a local brand for espresso beans which I was so happy to hear as that usually means great espresso.  However, when they went to make my drink, I saw they use pods in a machine, needless to say it wasn't the locally roasted beans I was dying to try OR even a hand crafted espresso drink.  I specifically requested how I liked my drink made and it all came out wrong.

I am disappointed as like I mentioned above, great place for healthy food, but in my experiences it has been just off all 3 times.  I wish it wasn't the case because it is convenient for us to eat at, but there are many other restaurant choices in Desert Ridge.  I will say because I believe in healthy Organic food, I will try this place one more time for dinner and perhaps will receive a different outcome."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast this morning for my partner's birthday. To say the least, was not impressed. The service was ok, he didn't know his menu very well, but the food was so mediocre for the price. Although, I love the quality of food being that most of it is organic, the taste just didn't pair. Our breakfast was cold and we waiting probably five minutes at the table after being seated before anyone approached us. As a previous restaurant manager and bartender/server for years there were just too many things I couldn't excuse. Sorry folks."}
{"text":"I walk to Tryst occasionally on the weekends for breakfast when I feel like a healthier option than McDonalds.  The food is really good and there are plenty of less healthy items for the non discriminating eater.  I've had the Monte Cristo a couple times and it even tastes healthy.  It's pretty quiet and there are quite a few items on the menu that you won't find anywhere else.  If you are just looking for a regular breakfast, they can do that also... and the sweet potato tator tots are delicious!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this gem of a cafe right around the corner from our house and it's certainly going to be the new go-to brunch and lunch place! We went for a late breakfast on Saturday, and thankfully the place wasn't that busy so we were seated right away. I feel as if going out to breakfast on a weekend is always slightly stressful as you have to wait for ages to get seated due to the crowds, anywhere you go. So this was a nice surprise. We liked the food so much we even ordered take out the same day for dinner!

I love how this place is health conscious, without lacking substance and flavor. I ordered the egg white kale omelette and it was fantastic. My eating companion got pancakes, eggs, bacon and toast, which I sampled and we both enjoyed it very much. For dinner I got the steak salad and they had a special for cornmeal fried fish and chips which was also a big hit.

I'm excited to try out more of their menu, they have a variety of bloody mary's on the menu as well that look very tempting. The atmosphere in the cafe is relaxed, clean and with good service. They have a small open air patio that is covered and shaded from the hot sun too!"}
{"text":"My brother in law gave us a Travel Zoo coupon so we thought we would try it.  Wife had the ribs and I had the Beef Wellington. The Ribs were a little fatty and I didn't really like the caramelized onion on the wellington but overall it was OK..  We had great service and the waiters wine suggestion was fantastic.  (it was half off with the coupon. ) The Beer battered green beans and the sweet potatoes fries were also very good.  If we didn't have the coupon we would have spent $115 for the two of us so it was a good deal."}
{"text":"We ate at the Tryst Cafe for this first time this morning. The cafe was packed but we were seated within about 10 minutes. 

My wife had the almond topped brioche french toast. She is found of french toast it is is amazing how many places do such a poor job or want to pile on super sweet fruit and whipped cream. She found this french toast to be very nice.

The loss of 1.5 star comes from my breakfast. I'm a lover of lox and I will go for the lox and bagel most anytime it is available. 

First across the top of the menu you will notice it says organic and locally grown. Now we buy our veggies every week from the farmers markets and specifically McClendon's who does provide outstanding produce to valley restaurants. Lox & bagel will come with tomatoes and these tomatoes were not locally grown and I'd be surprised if they were organic. They were pink and white, paper thin and had no flavor at all. The bagel was not toasted and the cream cheese was so light and fluffy that it had hardly any flavor. 

The loss of the 1.5 other stars came from the poor service, but not our actual server she was fine. We both had iced tea and by the time I was done with mine my wife was about half way through hers. A server came by and filled my glass and totally ignored my wife then she gave iced to the table next to us. When we asked her for more tea for my wife the server apologized and said her mind was some place else. We also agree with other reviews about the hectic pace of the servers but little getting done. 

I don't recall anyone (especially the lady running the cafe that morning) ever asking if everything was ok or did we enjoy our food. The lady in charge was not at the front when we came in nor was she there when we left.

We were lucky to eat on the patio as it was more pleasant than inside."}
{"text":"Six of us came here & we all had different breakfast items. We each gave our dishes 5 stars . This will be our breakfast destination anytime we're in Phoenix. Tryst omelet & bananas foster pancake are the best!"}
{"text":"If only they had a place like Tryst Cafe back in California! The first and only problem I had with the place was the fact that I wanted nearly everything on the menu. They have amazing specials, and while the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed-walnut French toast looked amazing, I was hungry and opted for the Hawaiian breakfast.

The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didn't order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed one's are so expensive it's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise.

My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijing's yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didn't get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty.

Overall? Great choices, great venue, and good food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch here for the first time after reading all the rave reviews from fellow Yelpers. I had the tuna salad and it had a real nice flavor thanks to the dill and the fresh croissant, all accompanied by string fries. Others in my group had the salad which they enjoyed, though in one of the bowls there was too much dressing. They were served attractively in a large slanted bowl.
You can enjoy your meal inside or out. Servers were very attentive.
It was a bit spendy but  I'm glad we ate here while in the area."}
{"text":"We really like Tryst.  Haven't been there in a few months but we would go quite often for the Fish Bake on Friday's.  Always had a good experiment and enjoyed the craft beer they have as well."}
{"text":"Best lox I have had in a long time. The food is delicious and healthy. The menu has all types of food for all times if the day. I had a fantastic mimosa as well. The only reason I will not give this place 5 stars is because the service was very slow."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have had mixed experiences.  Due to the fact that this restaurant is local/organic, they are unfortunately confined to what is locally available and in season.  

With that said, their food in the summer in my experience has been better than their winter food.  We did not have the best experience there this past weekend and it is likely we will not be back for a little while.  

Their breakfast is great, however, but their selection is fairly limited.   Their sangria is really good and their beer selection is slim but offers local beers which is a plus.  I can't really recommend anything on the menu at this point because it changes so often.  I would, however, recommend going during happy hour because their deals are fairly decent. 

I wish they would bring back their \"Halfy Hour\" where everything on their menu is half off; that may entice us to go back more often."}
{"text":"First let me say that I've been here twice and ordered the Hawaiian breakfast both times. The first time the food was fantastic as well as the service. The Hawaiian includes jasmin rice covered with cooked cabbage, then pulled pork and two fried eggs and topped with a sweet Asian sauce.  Today's food was totally different.  It literally was 1/2 the portion of the first time I had this. Came with jasmin rice, if it had cabbage I didn't see or taste it. Pulled pork was good, however there was no sauce on it I asked for extra but I think it was left off entirely. Tryst was busy and perhaps didn't have enough servers. My husband had to ask for more coffee or his glass would have remained empty.  I've decided I will give this place another try and I hope I won't regret it"}
{"text":"Tryst is one of those local spots that merits a 'Try'... C'mon! Is in the name! You don't think much of it when you come in, but the menu is full of great stuff. Great portions, good prices, and big flavor. The staff is awesome. I love having them in the neighborhood. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing and the service is swift and friendly! We sat at the bar and were extremely impressed with the morning spirits as well as the food. Our bartender/server was Daniel and he was excellent as well. When I travel back to Phoenix I will make a special trip back!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place after a recycle event @ Desert Ridge. Ate the basic breakfast....loved the sweet potato tots and mimosa to wash it down....gonna try their happy hour next. Best part is it's in a small shopping center on the opposite side of the busy one!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my brother bday.. it was great! The waitress suggested we try their award winning  beer battered  green beans. I am not  a fan of green beans in general.. but they really were pretty tasty. I also have the portobello  sandwich  and i really wish i saved myself some for later. It was light and tasty!  We are planning to go back this weekend got breakfast!"}
{"text":"I originally looked at Tryst Cafe as a brunch possibility a few weeks ago, but didn't end up getting to there. There brunch menu and the photos on yelp made it look amazing. I am hoping to try out their brunch soon. I did get to try out their dinner last night with a friend. My friend and I started off with the battered green beans appetizer that comes with like 6 different dipping sauces. I was a big fan of the cilantro aioli. For dinner, we both got the Ahi Tuna melt with brie cheese on a parmesan crusted brioche bread. It was absolutely delicious and we would both recommend others order it. The sweet potato tots that we had as a side instead of the salad that normally comes with it were a great compliment to the sandwich. Of course, we had to finish off our meal with their cr√®me brule that had fresh strawberries and blackberries on top. It was a great end to a great meal. The cr√®me brule was delectable to say the least. Overall, we had a great experience and an amazing meal. Even though we didn't try any of their cocktails, I did look at the cocktail menu and am excited to try one of them my next visit. I have my eye on the pear margarita. :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Tryst because several friends told me how good it was. I went in for Happy Hour and the service was really slow, but the restaurant seemed busy and I tried to be patient. When the food finally arrived it was just o.k. Being somewhat disappointed I decided to go back for a second visit hoping the first experience was just a bad night. My experience the second visit was the same and I was not impressed with the food. It was average and I was hoping for a better experience with both the food and waitstaff the second time around."}
{"text":"After two failed attempts at trying to love this so called \"Hip, Organic Cafe\" I'm going to have to give it a generous 3 Stars. So sad. I really wanted to like it but it's lacking in several key \"hip and awe inspiring\" factors. 

A. To be \"Hip\" means to be considered aware of or attuned to what is expected, especially with a casual or knowing air; cool. - Webster

NOBODY in this place was in tuned to ANYTHING that we needed nor gave a shit about what was expected. Waitress/bartender/hostess was very clearly perturbed by me changing my mind about sitting on the stuffy patio and made a snotty comment as she walked back inside. 
She didn't get any more pleasant when she graced us w her presence 15 minutes later. We had to get up & find someone for water and again for our check. 

So not Hip...

The food was pretty good, I'll give them that. Expensive but good. Nothing to write home about but we weren't disappointed. I got the Ahi Tuna Salad with Aioli. The tuna was seared perfectly and the dressing was good. The Aioli was good but there was barely any drizzled on the top of the tuna. Not very big portions for the price. My sister got a Brie Tuna Melt which she said was pretty good. 

The dining area is very cramped as is the patio, too many tables shoved in a small, unimpressive area. The canvas curtains on the patio were closed shut to the beautiful morning outside and the space heaters were on full blast. People were stuffed in like sardines. 

Not impressed. Go across the street to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Between me pulling an all nighter, once again; and my wife studying hard for her upcoming finals; our normally fun Saturday jaunts have been curtailed for a month now.

Therefore, when it came time for lunch, we wanted something quick and healthy; and my beloved found this delightful place in the Desert Ridge Area.

When we arrived, we were promptly greeted and seated. We could've opted for the covered patio seating, which looked very comfortable, but we opted to dine inside.

Shortly thereafter, our server Gina, introduced herself and handed us our menus; as well as, took our drink order.

As we perused the menu, we noticed that they had a plethora of healthy options, and everything seemed to cry out, \"try me!\" All these dining decisions to be made, and with so little time to study and make them! 

In any case, after a few moments of thumbing through the pages, I opted for the Kale Omelette. My wife ordered the Chipotle Vegetarian Burger, with a side of salad and fries. 

For good measure, we ordered the Hummus Trio as an appetizer.

The Hummus Trio had such a simple, yet wonderful presentation. Three types of Hummus to sample, along with some Cucumbers and Pita bread. We were quite impressed with the flavors of all three Hummuses. Along with the cucumber, and the scrumptious Pitas, it just made for a delightful dish.

Then along came main course. My wife's Chipotle Vegetarian Burger had a wonderfully meaty flavor, even though it had no meat in it. And the inclusion of the grilled onions gave it a smoky flavor. Additionally, the Chipotle sauce on the burger just made the whole dish divine!

The only issue that she had the the burger was that the bun had a tendency to disintegrate and made the burger too messy to the point that it had to be consumed with the aid of a knife and fork.

Her side salad had a sweet, vinaigrette dressing that was just marvelous.

My Kale Omelette was quite good. Perhaps, a little on the bland side, but Kale does not exactly have the most distinct flavor. It was still a wonderful dish!

Overall, the superb and delightful dishes that we had; along with the prompt and courteous service made for an amazing first time visit to this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast after a hike. I had the pecan French toast. Expected something a little different, but still good. Ordered a side of sweet potato tots- good, just expensive for the amount given. Coffee was excellent. Would come back if I was in the area again. They have a large menu that looks amazing! Just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Happen to find this little gem after my doctors new location. It's small inside but very cozy. The staff were so sweet! 
I differently will go back when I'm in the neighborhood.  :)"}
{"text":"The servers were very poor, no smiles no how are you's, their greatings sucked. I asked for the outside patio and the hostess told me to wait and she had to ask and upset server where to put us, they argued for several minutes, I said \"can I just sit by the bar?\" 

I had I say hi to one of the servers just to make sure they were alive.

But I ate the food and 2 mimosa later I did not care.

Our server Daniel was great."}
{"text":"Mimosas are to die! Fresh squeezed orange juice that they make for every glass. The servers are so knowledgable in the quality of food and even offered to walk us through the gluten free options. Especially Sam! She really seems to love what she does and was on her A game. Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Simply enough, my food was cold. Not just lukewarm but ice cold. I sent it back and when it reappeared, clearly microwaved, the plate was hot but the food was not. I take issue with two things: (a) if I am paying those prices I expect my food to be hot and (b) I do not accept microwaving as an acceptable method of remedying the situation--if I wanted my food microwaved I would go to McDonalds. 

What was most upsetting, however, is that after sending the food back a SECOND time I was ready to just get the check and go. My dining companion was already finished with his breakfast so I saw no point in waiting around while they \"whipped something up.\" After some cajoling from our server to order something else, and ordering something else they had the nerve to charge me for the yogurt I reluctantly ordered! In my book, if you mess up someone's meal *twice* you don't charge the person for the replacement. They clearly did not care to have me as a repeat diner and they won't."}
{"text":"First visit. Not to be the last. Breakfast was awesome. Fresh OJ. Hawaiian breakfast was extremely yummy and filling. Eggs over easy on double smoked pork and cabbage and rice! Ate it all. She had the quesadilla and took half home. Might go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Extraordinarily ordinary.

At here on a Saturday late morning with wife and two kids.  First, there was a wait for tables, which is fine and frankly expected on the weekend at a small cafe.  But then they sat us and no waiter showed up.  Once fixed, service was really marginal for the rest of the meal.  

Food was just okay.  Wife had the turkey burger, which was just very boring and not exceptionally tasty.  I had the Tryst Omelet which was reasonably priced but very underwhelming in presentation and taste.  The sweet potato tater tots sounded cool, looked cool, and tasted pretty great for the first five or six in your mouth.  But there were a LOT of plates I saw taken away with nearly full portions of the tots.

Kids meals were just okay.  The kids burger had a patty that tasted worse than any McDonalds or school lunch program burger I had in High School.

Setting is an upscale strip mall.  Inside is pleasant.  With outdoor tables and misters, this would be a terrific late Fall through Early Spring breakfast joint if you live in the area. 

Food isn't terrible.  As a whole, better than a Denny's.  But really nothing exceptional at all.  And the owners were nice and friendly, but they need to teach their servers better manners and to spend less time flirting with co-workers and more time focused on taking care of the customers.

I surely won't go out of my way to come back, but if I had an hour to kill for breakfast and was in the area, might give it another shot if nothing else looked better.

I mean, not every place can be a Matt's Big Breakfast or St. Francis or any of the other exceptional restaurants around town, but the food, service, and atmosphere earns this place a solid 2 stars."}
{"text":"Had an appointment in this area and found this cafe on Yelp. Absolutely a great dining experience, 4 star service and presentation. The Hawaiian breakfast was delightful. Can't wait to come back. Soild Value across the board."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant near Desert Ridge in North Phoenix--good natural, organic food.  Had chorizo and eggs, great presentation and absolutely delicious!

Will be back for dinner service and can't wait to sample some organic wines!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a golf tournament and my family always goes here so I decided to try it and it was DELICIOUS! I got the fish tacos and iced tea and it was amazing! It was so fresh and was a great dinner. I plan on returning to Tryst when I'm back in town! The atmosphere is great. Our waitress was training someone and they both did a great job!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast- period. Healthy food that doesn't taste like it. Best sweet potato tots. Breakfast wrap is unbeatable and they serve all breakfast until 2 or 3 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very original menu! I will be returning for their dinner menu soon. They had a wonderful Bloody Mary with unique presentation, and comfortable patio spaces."}
{"text":"This place is okay -- I really don't get the hype. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes and they tasted burnt. My boyfriend ordered the french toast and that was pretty good. Service was slow and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. Friendly place. I'd come here for breakfast since it's so close to where I live but I certainly wouldn't make any sort of effort to come here. I do support their organic and sustainable food."}
{"text":"Great mimosas and bloody Marys.  Good food on a consistent basis; I've tried several things on the menu.  They have a nice patio to enjoy relaxing outside over brunch.

Oh and the sweet potato tots, which I love with their wasabi aoli...yum!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but over all a little lacking particularly for the price. Service wasn't exactly prompt, but neither was it a problem. Very middle of the road over all.

If a friend picked the place I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but I doubt I would on my own. That said I feel like there is potential."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast and lunch neighborhood spot with friendly service.  We enjoyed the Monte Cristo with sweet potato tater tots and a chicken salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been on vacation for a week. We have eaten breakfast 4 times here at Tryst. I have had the Kale omelet and it's delicious. Warm atmosphere, friendly staff, and excellent food. We will be back in March!"}
{"text":"Good Lord, this is some fantastic food. The chorizo eggs are insane, and I think the sweet potato tots ate infused with crack because you can't stop eating them. Choices here are all focused on a healthy meal, yet none of it is flat and tasteless like it usually is."}
{"text":"Service and food were amazing! It's such a pain to try and eat out with as many dietary restrictions as I have, but out waiter was extremely helpful and patient with my questions. Can't wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!"}
{"text":"OK at best. There are just too many other breakfast restaurants that are much betrer."}
{"text":"Had the tuna salad sandwich and green iced tea.  Five + stars.  Love this place."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but it is a bit overpriced in my opinion. The level of service I received has varied greatly on every visit. They do have some great healthy options though."}
{"text":"Staff is wonderful! Drinks are great.... food is meh.... Went for brunch on a Sunday. Highly recommend you make a reservation... we did... they were super busy. 
I saw an order of breakfast nachos come out- they looked amazing!
I ordered them- meh.... no flavor.  Dry chicken.  
The rest of the group ordered various omelette and burritos.  It was all just ok. 
Take the review for what it's worth.  But we will probably not return as there are many many amazing places to eat in the same area."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast place to mix it up a bit and try something new. I was hooked when a previous yelper mentioned that the pancakes were so good that her husband wanted to hug the chef. I am definitely a sucker for pancakes.

It was a beautiful saturday morning so I  decided to eat outside on the patio. The tables are too close together because it seems like you're hearing too much of the conversation at the adjoining table in my opinion. The 3 pancakes were huge. Although for some crazy reason they give you a small thimble of syrup and enough butter for maybe 1 1/2 pancakes. So I had to request more syrup and butter for my pancakes. The pancakes were good but not \"hug the chef\" good.

I will eventually return to the Tyrst Cafe to sample other dishes. I rate this establishment three stars or A-OK, which is the definition of 3 stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"Been driving past Tryst for years and we finally stopped.  SO GLAD we did.   I love Reuben sandwiches and they simply knocked it out of the park.  The fries are deliciously crispy- not wimpy.  The atmosphere is between an uptown funk feel and classically comfortable.   You can sit indoors or outside.  Service is a little slow- kinda like they were understaffed but very friendly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the most PHENOMENAL looking salad that that sort of BURST open after you cut the cucumber ribbon that tightly held it together. But due to the lack of seasoning and the not the freshest protein on my salad I feel a three star rating is worthy. I don't think any salt or any pepper was used in the proteins or in the dressing and certainly no herbs were tasted. The vegetables in the salad are local and organic and were a nice combination.

My husband had the steak salad and the steak was tender and plentiful but also seemed to be unseasoned. Instead of the cilantro ranch dressing that comes with the steak salad he picked the balsamic that was almost tasteless the day we were here.

Maybe it was an off day for this restaurant since it was the Memorial Holiday Weekend? I'd give them another try but I certainly would not order any fish here."}
{"text":"This has become a staple of mine, it's a great place to have a good lunch and conversation.  The noise level is pretty low that it's easy to have a conversations.  The staff is always friendly and easy to work with.  Some of my favorites include the pork taco special and the grilled cheese (three cheeses and avacodo, yummy)."}
{"text":"I just went to this place for the first time and loved it! I'm vegetarian and my husband likes meat. The menu had options for both of us and we both thought it was delicious. They also have kombucha on tap and it is yummy! I'm going back again"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Great kick back get away for coffee and brunch.  Service is always on point and the organic menu is perfect."}
{"text":"Go to Tryst! The food was great! Have the goat cheese and chicken salad - perfect. I can't wait to go back and try more things."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service! I live right behind this restaurant and I love it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Their beet salad, chicken tortilla  soup, and burgers (including the veggie burger) are amazing! I have never ordered sown thing from here that I didn't like. They have great organic and gluten free food."}
{"text":"Tryst is an organic cafe located in the Desert Ridge area. Tryst serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and if you go in from 3pm-6pm they will take 50% off your bill. This is an amazing deal considering most of their entrees are a little pricey. I got the bring it on burger with fresh mozzarella, pesto, capicola, and tomato. The burger was good but I was a little jealous of my friend's steak dinner with potatoes and bacon wrapped green beans. Her entree was only $8! Everything on the menu looks delicious and I can't wait to come back and try their breakfast.

* You can purchase $30 gift certificate for $15 on localdines.com"}
{"text":"Just ate here- went out of the way to eat at a restaurant with gluten free options- ordered gluten free and after we'd all had several bites I decided to confirm it was GF- NOPE. We will be dealing with GI issues the rest of the day and the waiter acted like it was no big deal. We were very upset. It is a big deal! Food allergies and intolerances are dangerous. The burger that we ordered even said GF on the listing. WTF?"}
{"text":"Can i give this a zero ? No seriously, can I please give no stars? I came here because of the numerous reviews on yelp. (Maybe they were having an off day , maybe I can make excuses for them ?) So here's how it went down. We went in and not only was there no one to greet you at the door, the hostess walked past us twice before coming back and acknowledging us (5 minutes down) and then we got to the table. Nice, clean and while it was cozy (as the realtors may call it) we were hoping to enjoy the meal. ha ! 15 minutes later (I used a timer) someone comes and gets our order - no, the waiter did not acknowledge us, walked by us numerous times, and when he did (Jason, I think) he was curt and abrupt. Ok the food will make up right ? Wrong !! 

The food came another 15 minutes later, luke warm - so no fault of the kitchen stafff - the coffee was lacking (I am a coffee snob, so that may be me completely being unreasonable) and the fruit drink was ok (I forget what it was). The food was ok, nothing to wow you with nothing to really rave about. 

Asked for the check which came promptly but was not picked up for 10 minutes and I walked it over to the register. Our waiter could be heard complaining about some customers with his coworkers (we all do it, but seriously, not in ear shot!) and he slowly walks over, charges us. No really, the worst service in a long time. 

Tip = 0.00 Something I have never done but it was just the worst dining experience yet. Maybe my expectations were high, maybe I thought it would be great...what a let down"}
{"text":"Kinda pricy for 2 pancakes .... Pancakes are not that good... Great service but not impressed by their breakfast options.
You have to order sides because pancakes prices ranging from $10+  come by itself :/ no like"}
{"text":"Definitely need to recommend the Benedict. Nice environment for a date or business meeting. It's not a noisy restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was such a surprise! Delicious food that ended up being pretty healthy with lots of gluten free options! I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were honestly the strips of crispy corn tortillas made it little hard to eat with a fork. I can't complain too much, they were delicious! Whether or not you have dietary restrictions, this place is fantastic. Check them out!"}
{"text":"An unclear menu and chalkboard signage, as well as lack of information from our server, lead to confusion.

Like most have said before, my friend and I were very pleased with the atmosphere at Tryst Caf√© in terms of its decor and layout. However, information about specials on the menu and two separate chalkboards lead to confusion about what specials were available (given the day of the week and hour of the day.) When we inquired with our server, she didn't know and had to double check what was included, when specials were available and for what price. I'm not sure if she was new to this job or just insufficiently trained.

Fortunately, Tryst Caf√© delivered in other ways. The drinks were sufficiently strong. My friend tells me her two glasses of Montpellier Cabernet Savignon (pictured) were delicious. My Tryst Pepino was fine, though was missing the mint garnish described on their menu.

The Humus Trio (pictured) was delicious and came with slices of fresh cucumber however, it did not come with the traditional side of pita bread which had to be ordered separately. The Steak Salad (pictured) was amazing and the chunks of meat were oh, so, tender and juicy!

I hope to revisit Tryst Caf√© sometime soon. My only hope is that they clear up some of the confusion about what specials are available and appropriately train their staff to know what is actually included, when specials are available and for what price."}
{"text":"I like Tryst for their organic options. This time I was going to try the egg and kale breakfast and asked about substituting a pancake for the cottage cheese (because I don't care for it) and was told I would have to pay extra. It made no sense because the two sides are the same price on the menu. I could only substitute a potato. I opted for the Tryst breakfast with the side pancake ($3). The bill comes and the pancake was $4. They corrected it but said they had increased the cost. Then please update your menu. Not sure I will be back soon despite it being decent healthier food."}
{"text":"Went in with a friend for brunch and was happy I did.  She got the pancakes and they were huge.  My burger was excellent, and the staff was friendly and pleasant!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was tasty, what they gave you of it. I ordered corn beef hash last weekend and the portion was so small that you could barely see it among the potatoes. My friend said something about it before I even noticed. I said something to the waitress and she said that was the typical small portion. I will likely go back, but will never order that again."}
{"text":"I ordered organic 3 eggs kale omelet. It was awesome. Great breakfast choice. I live dessert ridge for 2years and try this place first time. I will be back."}
{"text":"Really great spot for breakfast or brunch. The food was great and overall had a good experience. The only issue I had was the time it took to get seated. I understand things get busy, but the hostess seemed a little overwhelmed the 3 times I've been. It might benefit them having two people up front to greet guests."}
{"text":"What can I say.....Meh.  Service was great but food was just weird and flavorless. Wife had the Monte Cristo. Cinnamon and strawberry jam?  Rather nasty. I had the Hawaiian Breakfast - better but still rather bland. I try somewhere else for these prices."}
{"text":"I love breakfast. Unfortunately there is not many cozy cafes up north here. Found this hidden gem other day while I happened to be in the parking lot. Very hard to spot, the signage was not well designed, to small, so it doesn't grab your eye. If you have walleye vision forget it, it's invisible basically. 

The cafe is cute and cozy. Got there around 1245 ish and was surprised that it wasn't  more crowded. The menu was fresh and highly organic. I stuck to my favorite of steak and eggs. Eggs were well cooked, and the steak comes in thinly sliced cuts, which were actually pretty tasty. Normally when you get toast at a breakfast joint the jam or jelly comes in those 5 cent plastic tubs that for all I know are a decade old and packaged in Bangkok by 6 year olds , not here. They use fresh organic stuff here scooped into a heap that is eatable in itself. Nice work.  Staff was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. The prices were moderate I'd say. Our bill for two was close to 30 bucks which is a bit pricey for breakfast, but I'm sure rent in that location is a business killer. My only missing desire was they didn't have a stack of courtesy newspapers. You can't have a breakfast joint and not have a morning paper to browse through while sipping on a delicious coffee in my perfect world."}
{"text":"Although it is a little pricey for breakfast, the Tryst Benedict is a delight as well as the Monte Cristo. They hook up breakfast with panache in a unique way. It is worth a try if you don't mind spending $40 for breakfast for 2 on occasion; depending on what you order and how well you tip. We always sit at the bar and get fantastic service there. As for the coffee being light...I don't need my coffe to be as strong as meth so it works for me."}
{"text":"Nice option for good eats.  Everyone I've been here the food and service were good. The staff is friendly and the menu options are wonderful.   
I like the healthier options that don't sacrifice taste."}
{"text":"Ate at Tryst cafe on a saturday night of a weekend getaway to JW Marriott desert ridge with my husband and children aged 11 and 15. We had done a lot of driving that day up to Jerome and Sedona and back down through the dark of night and a thunder storm. We were so happy to find the highly rated Tryst Cafe still open at 9:30 pm. Adrianna and Haley gladly welcomed us into the restaurant and helped us with our appetizer and entree selections. We had the tilapia crisps and fried green beans to start. Tilapia crisps were ok, fried green beans were spectacular!!!! Immediately got another order of the green beans which we had to fight our children off to get a bite of!!! Yes, a teenager who hates green beans could not stop eating these! I highly recommend them.  Hubby got the ahi salad- amazing with fresh greens and a spicy wasabi dressing. I got the southwest salad and asked for steak instead of the chicken it comes with ( no problem- said Adrianna). My salad was fresh, crisp and lovely but I probably should have left it with the chicken. Steak wasn't great. Our girls both got the pasta of the day which was penne with pesto, chicken and saut√©ed yellow squash-delicious! Kids devoured it.  
Adrianna and Haley were so welcoming and accommodating. We had a great experience here and will definitely go back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A quick stop in for a sampling of this hidden gem in Phoenix. Have dinner plans but I was treated to an amazing organic agave margarita!!! Personnel super welcoming! Wish we not leaving tomorrow so we could have come back!!! Took a whiskey cake for dessert!!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast!  I had the veggie omelet and sweet potato hash.  I felt like my omelette could've used more cheese or maybe just more filling in general and the eggs were cooked pretty hard but it was alright.  My husband enjoyed his chorizo and eggs with world's biggest tortilla.  Kids dominated the chocolate chip pancakes so they must've been pretty good.  The coffee was good but a slosh weak.  Servers were busy so we had to request coffee refills.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love love love our go-to restaurant. We live very close by and love eating here on average once or twice a week (depending on our schedules). The service is fantastic (Rachael is the best and don't worry, the rest of the ladies are awesome too)! I have read some of the reviews and a lot of people review the \"brunch\". Seriously you can eat here any other time as well! Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all fantastic! (Even the music selection is great)! Just writing this review is making me hungry :).... oh and one last thing.... they have a diners rewards program (which we have redeemed multiple times)!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out Tryst and man, am I glad I did! The food was absolutely delish! The portion sizes were just right for health and hunger. The food was fresh, seasoned just right, and my salad wasn't drowning in dressing. We had the hummus trio which was excellent. The pita came out toasted and crisp which was a surprise, but I liked it! I then had the steak salad with perfectly prepared meat, and my friend had the seared ahi tuna which she kept saying was wonderful. I'm definitely heading back the next time I'm looking for a great healthy and tasty meal.

Have since been two more times! I've yet to be disappointed. The beet salad with chicken - which was amazingly moist and tender - was wonderful. My third trip I went for the Kahlua pork which I enjoyed immensely. Perfect for my heartier appetite that day. Bonus, it came with sweet potato tater tots which were crisped to perfection. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food it was really good and so was the seasonal beer that was organic"}
{"text":"When I met a friend here this morning for breakfast, we grabbed a table by the window and I sat with a view of the wall. There were culinary awards adorning that very wall, and I couldn't help but notice that there was a 2011 Phoenix New Times Award for best use of greens. I didn't even know that such an award existed until today!

This is another place that reminds me of Portland. It has a modern, yet hipster vibe as songs like \"Kids\" by MGMT and \"The Intro\" by The XX played in the background at 8 in the morning.

The Hawaiian breakfast was highly recommended by the waitress, seeing as how it also won 2nd place at a renowned breakfast competition in town. So of course, being somewhat reminiscent of an \"Islander\" myself, I figured I give it a try. After all, I'm quite the sucker for Kalua pork. It was really good. The slow cooked pork was tender and no pieces were over cooked or dried out in any way. I was very happy with this dish! My friend really enjoyed her Huevos Rancheros as well!

I'm now very intrigued about coming later in the evenings for happy hour when they have live musicians play. Oh, and of course, I'd like to see how their lunch and dinner items fare in taste."}
{"text":"Tryst was pretty good.  The quality of the food was good, but the prices are a little high.  I wish I could say more about it, but it's just \"okay.\"  Not great for parking, as it's in a strip mall across the street from Desert Ridge shopping center."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Tryst, I have been meaning to try this place for at least 8-10 months.
We came here for a late breakfast before a doctor's appointment.
Hubby had diet coke and I had decaf coffee.

Hubby ordered the breakfast burrito and I ended up going for our server's recommendation (Raechel) for Eggs Benedict, mostly because she mentioned the sauce had green hatch chile (I think she said hatch, but it is the green New Mexico chile).

Hubby liked  his burrito very much, I tough the Eggs Benedict were OK, but I don't think I would have them again.. I could see the green chile in the creamy sauce, but I could not taste it : (

Sweet potato tots were super sweet (duh! hehe) and seemed a little too greasy... but were still good. 

I was pleased with the glass cup for the coffee, it looked very fancy and nice.
Service was nice and friendly, and some other girl offered to refill our drinks even after we paid (that is a huge plus in my book) and she even got us a to go cup for the coke.

I would like to come back but probably not very soon. Receipt is a coupon for a discount on your next visit on Sunday 4 pm to 8pm I think.... a free kid's meal or a percentage off your check."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the steel-cut oatmeal with fresh berries, toasted almonds and brown sugar. I requested milk for the oatmeal, but it was not delivered until the end of the meal.  (I used the cream which was supposed to be for my coffee. ) The waiter did apologize.  

My husband ordered multi-grain pancakes which he did not enjoy.  He said they lacked flavor and were dry. However, the orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious.  Coffee was fresh and the other guests at our table  thorough enjoyed the gluten free French toast."}
{"text":"OK. Portions are a little shy for the price. I.e. a side of bacon was two pieces for too much $$. Atmosphere and service were good. Many gluten free options which were need.

#vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Good food, small portions. Hipster-Ish crowd. Kind of spendy for what you get, but \"healthy\" choices.  Quiet. It seemed like the people at Humble Pie were have way more fun, we could hear their music and see them (we sat on the patio and the Humble Pie patio is separated by a walkway-gotta check out that place next."}
{"text":"I am only writing this because this is the third time this has happened to me in a row at Tryst. Their food is phenomenal, however, their service is the WORST I have ever seen. I live near Tryst and would easily go there every weekend for breakfast and during the week for dinner if they didn't make me feel like scum every time I went there.

My first experience I sat at the bar and got breakfast. Was completely ignored the whole time and never once was asked how anything was and was only talked to to take my order.

The next time, I went for a week night dinner with a friend. Since we were the only one in the restaurant, the service was OK. However, upon reviewing my bank account, Tryst added about $10 more on to the TIP portion of the bill. When I went back to the restaurant and talked to a manager, she said she would take care of it and do whatever it took to fix it, and she took my name and phone number. Well, it never got fixed and I never heard from her again.

This past time this morning when I went in, sat at the bar again to eat breakfast, was not even asked ONE TIME if I wanted to refill my water. The only time I was asked if anything was OK was when my food was brought to me. After I finished my meal, I saw a waitress leaning on the bar and didn't even ask me if I needed anything. I had to ask a blonde waitress and she snarled at me after having an attitude with another coworker right in front of me: \"Well what tables are MINE?!?\" giving her an up and down look.

This place is downright unprofessional, has no class, and I WILL NOT ever return. It's a shame too, because the food is amazing and I would have spent a lot of money there. 

My recommendation to you is if you want to leave happy and not aggravated like I am, DON'T GO TO TRYST CAFE!!"}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes were wonderful.  The only annoying thing was the set of men next to us who were very loudly talking business.  So I talked loudly until they took the hint and lowered their voices.  It is hard to find breakfast places with gluten free options and this place has plenty.  There is not much space between tables on the patio, so if you want to avoid the loud talkers, I suggest you dine inside."}
{"text":"Decent place, good food. I did not enjoy the experience because there was a bad odor that would come and go. Also no misters outside which is a must in Phoenix summers. If these two things were fixed I'd go back."}
{"text":"After getting excited to share this new find with good friends from Arcadia what a let down!  The staff was welcoming, we were needing to wait for a table. We sat at the bar and asked for a bloody Mary especially after seeing the posted pictures of a bacon bloody Mary we waited all week to taste one.  With a VERY limp piece of celery that was it had NO TASTE whatsoever so don't let any of these pictures people post on here fool you.  Taught us a lesson never to invite people to a new pace until you have tried it yourself.  The wait staff was wonderful when I shared with her about the let down on the bloody Mary she said \"yup looks very poor\". Don't make the bacon bloodies because of the costs. 
Let's  get to the food, ordered three all meat omelets, one was so poor even the waitress was commenting let me return it!  All three were the same. We enjoyed our own company paid the bill and will chalk it up as our own fault for not trying this place out before inviting people to join you.  Sorry this pace didn't meet up to the write up and NEVER an apology not offered on the meal or drink. The two stars are for the wait staff!!"}
{"text":"By far one of our favorite dinner spot. Organic, vegan, gluten-free options as well as plenty of options for the rest of the crowd including burgers, wraps and salads. This restaurant has something for everybody and pleases all. The staff is very attentive and makes sure that the dining experience is enjoyable. The food is consistently amazing and always prepared perfectly with attention to all special request. I highly recommend Tryst for a casual but delicious dining experience!"}
{"text":"Tryst has great ambiance!  Whether you come for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  Their ingredients are top notch and they have a wide variety.  What is great is you can either eat super healthy, or indulge like royalty.  It took me my third visit to finally get something else besides the Hawaiian breakfast, it sounds wets but is phenomenal.  Their Asian kale salad and kale wrap are delicious."}
{"text":"Such a great find!! The \"Hawaiian Breakfast\" was amazing!! Great atmosphere too!! Will be back for dinner one day. Our waitress, Liza, is very helpful with meal suggestions and very sweet."}
{"text":"I first learned about Tryst Cafe when it was recognized with the Best Tater Tots by Phoenix Magazine in Fall 2011.  I recently learned that in 2010, Phoenix Magazine also awarded Tryst Cafe with Best New Restaurant.  Not sure what to expect, I stopped by once for breakfast and again for dinner a short while later.  Both meals were amazing!  There are daily happy hour specials from 3-6 PM each day as well as live music on the 1st Monday evening of every month.  They also host Tryst Around the World nights and a special New Years Eve menu.  

I have enjoyed every dish that I have tried from breakfast meals such as the Monte Cristo, a breakfast sandwich, omelets, and of course, sweet potato tater tots (definitely the highlight of any breakfast at Tryst!).  I have also enjoyed lunches and dinners at Tryst where I have had some great starters (in fact, there used to be a coupon for a free starter on its Facebook page).  Any dish whether an entree, burger, or sandwich has been worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love love love this brunch place. My favorite is the hawaiian brunch plate. There usually is a group of us when we go and everything everyone ordered was incredible. Love their sweet potatie tots, pancakes, burritos and egg dishes. I go back here Everytime I'm in Arizona..."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Had late breakfast with a friend before doing some shopping at desert ridge.   While I wasn't overly impressed with the breakfast croissant sandwich. The croissant itself was very good, applewood smoked bacon nice, fresh squeezed oj mimosa yum, and my friend loved her monte cristo, hence the 4 stars, and will be trying them again soon.  Probably for the pecan crusted French toast."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Marriott Desert Ridge and stumbled on to this spot this morning, what a gem!!!  The people were great, the food was outstanding.  Sorry I don't live closer to come more often.  I had the Huevos Rancheros... definitely not your traditional rendition, but great.  My husband had the Hawaiian Breakfast and loved it, too.  Staying two more days, will probably go back."}
{"text":"Nice place, good menu, good ambiance, good service. Visited here twice while on vacation. Second time had gluten-free pancakes, and they were terrible tasting. Worst I've ever had. They need a new recipe.

Update 8-6-16 to Lisa - Yes, I have eaten gluten-free pancakes for years, and at other restaurants. At home I eat Pamela's brand."}
{"text":"For the prices on the menu, I expected better than average service, taste and portions - all were below average on this visit.  Ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich, opened the 2 slices of french toast to find ONE piece of ham, a LITTLE melted cheese and NO strawberry jam.  Pointed this out to the waitress who obviously doubted me so I opened the sandwich and had to show her and then she stated, they are supposed to \"smear\" (Einsteins bagel term) the jam on the bread.  Took it back and they lightly swiped the jam on and returned the below par sandwich to me.  For $11.00 I expected much more than this.  My guest had the 3 meat omlette.  Again, lacking in size and meat.  The coffee, well I suggest they go down a few doors and take some lessons from their neighbor Starbucks, the coffee was below par as well, right in line with the service, attitudes and food quality/quantity.  The owners need to work on customer service with a smile and a more attentive staff and the food, well, put some food on the plate if you are going to charge higher than average prices or say bye...bye to your customers."}
{"text":"A friend and myself met for breakfast.  The server came to the table a couple of times asking for our order, but we were visiting and asked for a few more moments. We could tell she was not happy but left us alone for a couple more minutes. We ordered when she returned. Food was good, but after we paid and left a hefty tip, she came to the table to inform us that people were waiting to be seated, so please leave!!!!! WHAT!!! We will NEVER return!!! Sorry Tryst, you need to hire servers that belong in a service industry!!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this place. It's kind of tucked away in the corner of the strip mall it resides in and the sign doesn't draw much attention but thanks to Yelp, we found it. The surprise for me was the gluten free options. They were very tasty! We've been back several times and the servers know me by drink :)

So far, everything I have ate has been delicious. The only thing I would change is the portion size on some of the dishes but that's just cuz I have a big appetite, it's tasty and I want more. Fortunately, that is usually solved by going during \"Halfy Hour\" where EVERYTHING on the menu is half price (and yes, I order two. Kinda defeats the whole half thing but whatever). Good food, great service and lots of gluten free options. You can't go wrong with Tryst."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Walked in and was not even acknowledged by the hostess. We had to seat ourselves and sat for 10 minutes and not a single person even walked by or greeted us. Left without ever being noticed by anyone. The restaurant was also very slow at the time too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I have Celiac kiddos. Eating out does NOT happen much for us. I don't recommend this place for Celiacs.
We were seated with no problems for an early lunch. I really feel the problem lies in the menu itself. Many foods have GF options, but things like French fries are fried in a common fryer. There is NO allergy-free fryer. So when something is listed as being GF, you have to check with the server. For example, you might see \"Chicken tenders with fries   GF\" however we were told that the chicken tenders would have to be baked and we would have to choose the fruit option INSTEAD of the fries. Why not list or sell the fries a la carte instead since it is not GF after being in the fryer? The kids menu is small and with the Fries option out for us, that didn't leave much except for the adult meals. 
Also, my kiddo asked for a plain cheeseburger. Along came a hamburger with lettuce and tomato. Seriously? We sent it back and they added the cheese (took about another 10 minutes). 
Don't get me wrong, everything tasted delicious, however 2 hours after coming home, my Celiac kid is sick. I am not sure if it was cross-contamination or if they gave him the wrong bun but we won't be back.
I guess this is one of those places that is only catering to people who feel they need to be GF but not medically inclined. Disappointing. I will stick with Picazzos or even Red Robin for a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was lacking.
The menu has changed since my last visit. I really wish they would go back to having better options"}
{"text":"Took my girl in for dinner.  I am on a gluten free diet and she supports that.

Started with appetizers...  beer batter green beans... fantastic and spinach dip (my girl liked it)

I ordered the gluten free Kahlua pork sandwich and fries...  great sandwich!  I highly recommend it!

My girl got the bacon cheeseburger... another great choice.

and cr√®me Brule for dessert (not bad, but carmelization tasted  burnt.

Our server Ryan was very attentive and friendly...  by the way you have to try the tryst on the beach drink...... WOW!

."}
{"text":"I have been in for brunch a few times and enjoyed the food a lot.  I ordered the steak and eggs which was awesome.  I would recommend the breakfast sandwich as well. Service has always been nice but can be slow at times."}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively delicious! Food was great, drinks were great, and service was great! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big \"organic\" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.

Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.

As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day: Fabulous late lunch and service from Chelsea. Everything was very fresh and simply delicious. I loved the Roasted Beet salad. I wasn't disappointed that I forgot to get \"dressing on the side\". 

We love that this place is in the neighborhood and is a genuinely nice, quiet atmosphere with great healthy food. Hope Tryst can keep up in this economy. 

We plan to check out the breakfast too!"}
{"text":"The service was mean. The food was neither filling nor delicious. Prices were high for the amount of food. Went on a Sat AM and had the huevos rancheros which was a recommended signature item."}
{"text":"**REASONABLY-PRICED DINNER IN PHOENIX**

3.5 stars.

It was NOT Scottsdale, but the ambiance was nice and the people were friendly.

20 minute drive from downtown PHX.

We sat outside the patio area with other neighboring couples.

ORDERED:

*THE AFFAIRE ($10) 
Local greens, roasted tomatoes, shredded carrots, roasted beets, cucumbers, red onions, sliced portobello w/ house balsamic vinaigrette was fresh and delicious.

*JAMAICAN TILAPIA FILET ($17) Pan seared wild tilapia, cilantro rice and mango salsa was definitely fresh and good. I didn't care for the cilantro rice though. It would have tasted better with roasted side vegetables instead. But overall, a solid entree and would recommend.

EXTRA:
*CARROT CAKE (limited edition for March - $6)
I was not impressed by the cake. Runny cream cheese frosting and the cake was too sweet and not flavorful.

*COFFEE ($2.75)
Organic and fresh, it tasted good.

Friendly waiter.

I like the fact that the restaurant endorse local farms and foods, emphasizing on freshness, organic, and healthy.

Downside? A bit far from downtown PHX or Scottsdale.

Overall, a good HEALTHY dining experience in PHX.

RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Pink - Try)

Ever wonder about what Tryst cafes about
How it all turns heads
Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why

Where there is hunger
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's burger gonna get grilled
But just because it's organic
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and Tryst, and Tryst, and Tryst
Gotta get up and Tryst, and Tryst, and Tryst
You've gotta get up and Tryst, and Tryst, and Tryst

Bring it on -- Burger!

Tucked away from the Desert Ridge scene is this cute organic restaurant!  Wonders of this fantasy restaurant were once thought to be non-existing.  However, with my Google map I was able to local this mystic place!  Yes, Organic Restaurants do exist!  
 
I came here for lunch and ordered the \"Bring it on Burger\"!  Boy was it tasty! Mozzarella cheese, pesto and capicolla ham -- uh! Yummy!  It had just the right amount of sweetness to it where it didn't over power all the other ingredients. Add some sweet potato fries and you're golden Ponyboy!   Their beef burger is fresh and juicy too.  Yes, that's the name of the burger, not just trying to name off the ingredients.  It comes with lettuce and tomatoes between a brioche bun.

Tryst brings an energetic vibe to the North side of the valley.  In 2010, Tryst Caf√© was named Best New Restaurant by Phoenix New Times!  They have live music on chosen nights.  At first sight it looks like a basic caf√©, but as you venture in you'll notice a uniqueness about this place.  A full bar that serves a delectable breakfast and great tasting burgers.  Pancakes and beers sounds a like a different combination and yes you can definitely get both here. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I had brunch here before our day at the MIM and wow, what a great experience!

We are totally \"those\" people, he's a vegetarian and I'm dairy free. I know, I know, annoying. Tryst totally doesn't mind! Their menu caters to all types of tastes and requirements. They proudly serve a creative and organic menu.

We each had a spicy Bloody Mary. Fricken delicious, they're made with cucumber vodka and all sorts of veggies: olives, pickled green beans, celery, cherry tomato. The works. Totally hit the spot.

I had the Huevos Rancheros. Anytime I see this offered in a menu, I get it, so I'm kind of an expert. I wasn't overly impressed, but it was all right. There were way too many tortilla strips, which made the dish hard to manage. It was more like a \"build your own\" since all the ingredients were separated on the plate. Good flavor though.

The service was great as well, you could tell the girl was knowledgable and fun. The manager (or owner?) also stopped by to check on us and was super friendly.

It's really nice to have a small mom and pop type eatery in the land of chain restaurants and shops. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I could see through the coffee. They should really not serve it in glass mugs.  

Bloody Mary was good, not outstanding. Breakfast was good (I had the Monte Carlo), but not outstanding. For a place that bills itself as healthy and fresh, I expected more inventive options."}
{"text":"Decent and good live music until they served my husband's food cold and my salmon piping hot, but raw. When we told the server and she responded that \"we will do it better when you come back next time\" we decided to never come back again. Fat chance!... Yuck and in every way a way to ruin an appetite!!"}
{"text":"Good location across from Desert Ridge.  Celcius Sushi used to occupy this space.Had breakfast here the other day.  My friend ordered the Hawaiian Breakfast and loved it!  I had the French Toast with almond brioche ~ Banana Foster.  It was decadent!  We sat \"outside\" and it was pretty crowded for a Wednesday morning, that's a great sign!

The coffee was also delicous and the service was friendly.

We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for a reservation because this place was filling up pretty quickly. We still had to wait about 10 or so mins but all in all not to bad.  I met up with my teammates before heading out for a day of shopping for our victory outfits and we were not disappointed. The service was good and the food was pretty good as well. I loved the sweet potato tots that came with my two eggs over medium and two slices of extra crispy bacon. I was bummed to hear that they didn't have any other jelly flavor but strawberry ( I am a grape jelly lover lol). My teammates enjoyed their dishes as well and our waiter even split the checks for us. Score. I will be coming back again to try some other options on their menu soon."}
{"text":"I've recently been forced to go gluten-free and was happy to hear that Tryst has extensive GF options. The GF bread is very good, so much so that I didn't miss regular wheat bread at all. The roast beast is tender and flavorful, and the kalua pork is amazing. The sweet potato fries were perfectly done. My servers were attentive and friendly and kept me well supplied with iced tea.

Seating is a bit awkward and crowded, and the storefront is a little set back and hard to identify in a VERY frantic parking lot. Other than that, and the location being almost 30 miles from my home, Tryst is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! Everything from the customer service to the food itself is just 100% amazing! 

I am personally obsessed with their ahi tuna wonton cups, everyone should try them :) their choices are more healthy than other similar locales and put together with a great staff, the place is just wonderful. 

I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Expectations were high and not met.  I went on a weekday morning and the food seemed day-old and the servers neglected me a bit.  Still worth a quick stop though."}
{"text":"All I can say is eat breakfast here!   From the basic Tryst breakfast to the Hawaiian breakfast,  it is excellent.   Fresh,  delicious and unique.   Service is great as well!   I can't wait to try the Monte Cristo.   Check out the menu online and go there. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The coffee is good and the menu, although limited, has some pretty good dishes.  

Service is terrible, from the turtle speed hostess to the best buy reject waiters they are just plain bad.  Good news is that the turnover is pretty high so every once in a while you get a good one.  Hostess still moves like molasses.

The other day we went for breakfast and our friend asked the waiter how the sweet potato tots were.  
\"Amazing\", he said, 
\"Good I will take those\", she said  
\"Oh sorry we are out of tots\" 
\"How are the breakfast potatoes\"
\"Terrible.  I don't eat them.  I get the tots instead.  Now what can I get you?\""}
{"text":"This is our holy grail breakfast spot.  I get the breakfast sandwich.  The orange juice is the BEST OJ I've ever tasted and my fianc√© says it's the best coffee he's ever had. Just come for the drinks!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe across the street from the very busy desert ridge. My friend and I went here for brunch and we both really enjoyed the food. I got the breakfast quesadilla (YUM) and she got the Hawaiian breakfast (SUPER YUM). I base my restaurant reviews typically about the food. Why not give 5 stars? 
1) We sat at a small table right against the front window, which at first I enjoyed, that was until all the flies kept buzzing around us and doing what they do, incessantly headband against the window.
2) It was rather warm inside. Yes, we do live in AZ, but the inside of a restaurant is typically our escape from the heat. I love that they have a patio for extra seating because seating inside accommodates maybe 30 people (that's with the bar seating), but it's summer now and the heat was definitely making its way through the open doors to the patio. 
3) They charge you if you want to split a check. I haven't been to a place that does that, but I'm sure there's a reason for it that I'm unaware of.

My tips if you're considering trying out Tryst? Avoid the window table, choose the bar or a table closer to the middle where flies are buzzing and you're away from the patio doors (mainly during summer). As for avoiding the split check charge, tell them in advance you'd like to be on separate checks, or bring cash!"}
{"text":"Great cozy little cafe. I had breakfast here this morning. The staff is friendly, food is good, and the atmosphere is inviting. I had the meat lovers omelet and enjoyed every bite. I would recommend to a friend in the area."}
{"text":"This is a cute place. The live music on Monday nights is like a throw back to the 90's and 00's (in a good way). The guitar duo plays Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, etc... 

For food we ordered the portobello mushroom burger (nice and fresh), the   spring rolls (again fresh and tasty), ahi cups (looked impressive & a good sized portion arrived but I didn't try any because raw fish makes me sad), lastly the sweet potato tots make me want to nom nom nom all night long.
Oh and our drinks were awesome (generous and half priced).

Service was busy (on Monday nights there is a special) so the place was understandably busy but our waitress was super friendly and what bumped this place to five stars was the manager. He was helpful, accommodating, all around a great guy and what a manager should be. Yes he is da bomb that made me want to write this .com review. 

Definitely worth a gander especially on a Monday."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambience at tryst Caf√©. I always know I will enjoy their fresh squeezed orange juice and mimosas. Today I got there burrito but took out all the meat and cheese add it in avocado onions mushrooms bell peppers and it was wonderful. I would really like to see more vegan options on the menu. It is so important in this day and age to provide a real healthy food choices anything without meat or dairy. I would highly recommend adding their sweet potato tots on to any dish. Our server Rachel was awesome thanks For catering to her dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love looking into their champagne glass to find a never ending mimosa? Yes, Trysa is a perfect spot for bottomless mimosas. We did get a few appetizers to pick at too. Our server even cut up some extra peppers for our hummus since I am gluten free. Overall, a great place for mimosas and appetizers. Their entire menu looked delicious though!"}
{"text":"I haven't yet had the opportunity to eat in the actual restaurant of Tryst Cafe, but I did recently pick-up some lunch for my husband and I. For my first experience with Tryst, I normally would have given a meal of this caliber only two stars, but I'm cutting them a break since my food was to-go. My service was great, my meal was completed in a timely manner, but the food was just okay. 

For our lunch, we ordered the portobello sandwich with a side of black beans and the grilled cheese with french fries. The concept of each sandwich was decent, but they were both lacking in execution. I really liked the idea of putting both tomato and avocado on the grilled cheese, but there was so much cheese and avocado slathered on that the flavors overpowered the sandwich. Too much cheese always equals too much grease and that's coming from a serious cheese-lover. The portobello sandwich was average...nothing really to rave about. 

I do have to say that the main part of the problem with our meal may have been the fact that we took the food to-go. Everything was packaged neatly, but after a short drive to my husband's workplace, our food was mostly soggy and not quite what I would expect if it was served on a plate in the restaurant. My one suggestion would be to not place the sandwiches on top of the french fries. My fries were partially undercooked, but the grease from the grilled cheese and the condensation from the heat made for some seriously soggy fries and bread. Not good. They did put my husband's black beans in a separate container which was thoughtful; I wish they would have done the same for my fries. 

All in all, we didn't hate our meal, but the to-go food was not nearly as appetizing as we would have hoped. And the prices are a bit steep for the quality of the meal that we received. I would be open to trying the actual restaurant if someone suggested it, but if it were up to me, I'd rather go next door to Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Was invited to a breakfast birthday bash with 15 of my friends.  The place was smaller than I thought because they accepted our reservation for 16.  We were lined up against the window wall and pretty tight squeeze sitting inside.

The service was pretty good for 2 waiters vs. 16 of us and their other tables.  We did have to ask for refills.  I ordered the meat lover omelet (Three eggs, pecan smoked bacon, sausage, ham and white cheddar), roasted potatoes, & sourdough toast.  I think they found to add the white cheddar cheese to my omelet or it was a super small amount.  Basically a fluffy eggs folded in the meats with no cheese.  It was ok.  The potatoes were good! 

The rest of the menu looks greats, I would come back for 1 more try."}
{"text":"The BF and I tried this place today after purchasing a Localdines certificate.  It was decent, but that's about it.  It was very busy at 11am on a Sunday morning which was a good sign.  Took a bit before our waitress came by to take our drink order but she was obviously slammed and you could tell she was trying.  We were ready to place our order, but I asked what she recommended more...the veggie omelet or the chipotle veggie burger.  She said the burger is really good, but recommended I get the omelet because they were out of the \"good\" buns and only had potato buns left.  So I ordered the omelet...without mushrooms.  The BF was planning on getting the \"bring it on\" burger, but got the Tryst omelet instead after hearing about the bun shortage.  We also each ordered a glass of fresh squeezed o.j. ($5 each).  Seemed a little pricy, but whatever.  We had $30 to spend.

The food came out fairly quickly considering how busy they were.  First off, my omelet had mushrooms.  Not that big of a deal.  They were portobello slices so they came out easily.  The grilled onions were undercooked in my opinion and were big fat slices.  I'd have preferred them a little smaller or thinner or something.  The whole thing just lacked flavor and was really kind of greasy.  I've had way better omelets in my day.  The BF really liked his omelet.  Said the roasted tomatoes were incredible.  His was supposed to come with sweet potato tater tots, but he got sweet potato fries instead.  Maybe they were out of tots too.  

All in all, decent, but I'm glad I had a $15 for $30 certificate.  Our bill before tax came to exactly $30 dollars.  I think $15 for an omelet and o.j. Is kind of a lot.  Not sure if we'll be going back or not."}
{"text":"Just went in at 11 for Valentine's brunch with my hub because we saw this spot on Check Please. I told the hostess that it was a beautiful day and pointed to the patio where there was one clean table for 2 and a table needing clearing. She took us instead to the table closest to the door in the inside middle of the restaurant. What crossed my mind was that I was invisible to her.

Positives:  Great jasmine tea and Kale omelette.
Negative:   The meat lover's omelette should not have been served as is. The eggs and meat were overcooked. It had one small piece of cheese on the inside. It was as dry as a bone. I am very skeptical of a cafe that cannot cook eggs. I would fire or re-train whoever made that omelette.

My Hub did say he will take me back and try again. Maybe some day. I wish he had ordered a burger."}
{"text":"I am going to preface this by telling you we had a horrible experience.  Went for Sunday brunch.  Totally expected a wait which was 20 minutes.  Ask hostess \"hey wheres our table\" and got the \"you are next\" only to watch 5 more people get seated.  Get this, we were skipped because they ran out of high chairs.  There must have been a big baby party.  \" how many chairs do you own?  3, Three??????  The place sits 75 and they have THREE high chairs.  OK so we sat down, one of the kids with us had to eat in his stroller. which was a huge fire hazard but you are not looking for a safety rating.  We order the food, got coffee which looked like tea twice and our food finally arrived 20 minutes after ordering and was mediocre at best.  I am seriously epi pen lactose intolerant which I made extremely clear to the waitress/ manager several times.  So I eat one half of my sandwich and peel open the other side to find partially sort of removed cheese.  My hear t dropped.  I had no medicine with me and basically was about to have an episode.  We called the manager/waitress back over and showed her the cheese.  She took it back, brought me nothing to replace it and came back out later telling me how sorry she was and how the meal was on her and how she had explained to the kitchen no cheese and she would talk to the owner.  If I was allergic to peanuts I would have been dead.  Instead I just went home and was sick the rest of the day.  I would find another mediocre place instead that is run more professionally and is more aware of food allergies and what their customers ask for."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and have loved everything I've tried. The pulled pork sandwich, the tempura friend string beans, the hummus sampler, grilled chicken and goat salad, the burger, the sweet potato toters, the wine- it's all been good. 
The wait staff are very friendly and nice too. 
Can't go wrong by coming here!"}
{"text":"Really, really good.  Most/all of the items/dishes on the menu have a local/organic/better-for-you feel.  Friendly and attentive service.  I had a WONDERFUL barbecued pork sandwich -- tender, flavorful, great slaw, fresh egg bun, and HUGE.  Sweet potato tater tots were novel, and very tasty.  Nice (short) list of microbrews for the next time I go.  Breakfast menu looked interesting, too.  Covered patio."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp today and proceeded to try it for lunch. Food was tasty and service good. Just a bit pricey for the type of restaurant it is ....  an unassuming cafe."}
{"text":"Food was beyond excellent and the service was excellent too!  I have not ever tasted such good corned beef as served on my Rubin sandwich"}
{"text":"Always love Tryst and I go as often as I can.  I have never ordered something I didn't like."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  Such a great find and so sad I am from out of town. Cute decor and fabulous service. The server made great suggestions and we had to splurge. I have to admit that the healthy options brought me in the door, but we had to share the Pecan Crusted French Toast - SO GOOD!!  Sweet potato tater tots hit the spot too. 

I am not gluten free but so great to see so many options. I will definitely be back when I am back in town!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to review places unless I've been there at least twice, but now I'm making an exception. And second star is merely because food is organic.

First of all, I need to say I wanted to check this place forever. Heard so much hype about it that I pretty much decided for everyone that's where we're having lunch.
We came in on Saturday (2 adults and child). It was busy but we got seated almost immediately. And after that everything went downhill.

Our server was either the rudest or the most incompetent one I have ever had. Still can't decide which one of those is the case. My bf ordered espresso shot, he started listing all the drinks made with espresso shots. Asked him about specials or signature dishes, mumbled that everything is there. It got to the point where I was uncomfortable to even ask him a question.

For food I had ahi tuna melt sandwich, bf ordered The Affaire salad and kiddo grilled sandwich. Out of all three, grilled sandwich was the only decent choice. Salad was looking very nice, and that's about it. No dressing, a loot of lettuce and nothing more. After one bite, bf said he's returning it. Tuna sandwich was messy and greasy. And just plain ok. Supposed to come with house salad, which I am assuming was the 2 pieces of lettuce, carrot and corn on a side was. 

At the end we waited extra 10 minutes for our check and it did not come until bf went and found server. At that point we were so frustrated and just wanted out. He did took the salad off the bill, but bf went home hungry.

Well bottom line is that I will probably not go back. Service was lame, food was lame and the whole experience was not better at all."}
{"text":"Although the waitress was very nice, There was mold on the Caprese Appetizer, the Tilapia was uber fishy and on the verge of being spoiled. They comped up dessert to try to make up for all the horrible things but, we got the creme brulee. It was honestly the worst creme brulee I've ever had. It tasted like goat yogurt. Awful. I want to support businesses that use organics and alternatives such as gluten free but, i will not be back. Maybe they were just having a bad day."}
{"text":"menu is very interesting, food is delicious, service was great. we got to sit outside on the patio, which was lovely.  only downside is that it's located in a strip mall so the ambiance isn't too stellar. 

we ordered the kale salad with salmon -- HIGHLY recommend it.  the flavors were great, and the contrast in texture was perfect."}
{"text":"Tryst is the cure for the common brunch. Get the Hawaiian Breakfast and call it a day; or, close out your day with some pulled pork tacos and live music."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about breakfast here, so I thought I'd try it out. I got the Hawaiian breakfast - Kahlua pork. I love Kahlua pork. I didn't love it so much here. Something wasn't right in comparison to what my Hawaiian friends make for me fairly regularly. I'm sure everyone has a different recipe. This one just wasn't too tasty. It's too bad that I'm judging a place on one dish, but I wasn't impressed. The atmosphere was cramped and felt loud. I was just uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We needed a spot in a pinch, near our resort. Tryst was perfect for Breakfast!  Great menu for vegetarians, vegans and perhaps even the carnivore!  Outside seating available.  Organic and local menu items.

Tryst is an adorable little restaurant with a clean, comfortable modern decor, tremendous staff and a menu with innovative flavors and a very creative selection of breakfast choices.  It was difficult to decide.  I went with their version of the Eggs Benedict and LOVED it! Sounds simple, yes, but it included an incredible sauce and fabulous sweet potato tater tots.Delicious!

Price is a little high for such simple fare however portions were not small and quality along with creativity justifies it.

Again,...delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Desert Ridge for fast friendly service and amazing food! They have an organic menu with many gluten free options. Love coming here for happy hour, they have great drink specials and a $5 appetizer menu. I love the tilapia crisps and the Brussels sprouts and kale salad. Also make sure you try the honey basil organic beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. My review is for the waitress. We were a group of six with a baby and it was a nice day and we wanted to sit outside. There seemed to be plenty of open tables outside so we asked. Waitress said no without explanation. We politely asked again if she would reconsider and she said \"we should not count on it\". Just a weird way to speak to customers."}
{"text":"Eggcellent service. 

Great, healthy options as post workout meals. 

Rec- chorizo and eggs, huevos rancheros and Benedict."}
{"text":"Killer breakfast burrito, delicious coffee and great service. Happy I stumbled onto this place!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit here.  Most of the dishes are made with local and/or organic ingredients, the menu is quite diverse with lots of healthful options.  The fried green beans with a few house sauces were to die for and not too greasy at all.  I am definitely coming back to explore further.  Just a nice casual place for a mid-week dinner....nothing fancy but good hearty and healthy food."}
{"text":"Went to Tryst once for lunch a year ago and it was great so when I saw it on the Restaurant Week menu I was excited to try it with my spouse and friends.
Sooo not worth it.
Went on a Monday night- barely anyone there.
The service was not great as there were only two servers, albeit friendly.
The quality of the food was probably in the same level of an Applebees or Red Lobster.
They were out of almost every dessert. 
We were disappointed and our bill of $120 was so not worth it.

We should have crossed the street and eaten at Ocean Prime where the value would have been far better."}
{"text":"Tried to have breakfast for 2 on a Saturday. I know it's a busy day but if you tell me it's a 15 min wait but I see 3 empty two tops ( to be cleaned ) and 1 empty 4 -top (supposedly reserved on a Saturday!) I ain't waiting. That's just poor management."}
{"text":"We arrived at the cafe around 10:30 a.m. and there was a bit of a wait to get seated ~15 minutes or so.  Once we were seated we looked over the menu and it was a bit of sticker shock for a $10 plate for just pancakes with no sides of any kind and additional $2.50 for any kind of topper (chocolate chips, etc.).  A side of sausage would have been $3.50 extra.  

I opted for a plate of pancakes anyways and my fiancee ordered a sampler plate so that we could share between the two of us - a blend of the sweet and savory is always nice for breakfast. The pancakes had an odd flavor to them and I never was quite able to discern what was different about them - not bad, but just a bit odd.  His meal was good and probably the best part was the potatoes.  

Overall: B
I'd be curious to try something other than breakfast from here, but most likely wouldn't be back for breakfast considering all the other places around to try out and the higher price point."}
{"text":"I will say that the decor of the restaurant and the patio is adorable, but the food left me with a lot to be desired. I ordered the Hawaiian breakfast with kahlua pig and rice and hubby ordered the breakfast quesadilla. Hubby liked his food but I didn't think mine tasted that great and it tasted really sweet like they added maple syrup or something. I just couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box but never ate the leftovers. Prices were above average. For two entrees, we spent over $25. I'm not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Yeah, I agree with most of the reviews here. Food is super yummy, Service is poor. Patio is nicer than the dark interior for brunch. Come here if you are in no rush, and if you can let it roll off your shoulders when they get your order wrong, which there's a pretty good chance of. Five stars for food and two stars for service equals three stars. Plus, they take reservations for brunch which is nice."}
{"text":"I went in around 1pm on Sunday and ordered Tilapia crisps some of which smelled so bad that I could not eat them. This was the first time I have been disappointed at the Tryst and I hope it's not a trend of things to come. The other items ordered were fine."}
{"text":"Tryst is a hidden gem that everyone should try at least once in their lifetime. I was amazed at their decore , service and food presentation of this fabulous and delicious ORGANIC food that simply tastes out of this world. I never knew organic meals tasted that much more appetizing ; their menu from breakfast to dinner are extremely flavorfull and addicting. Once you taste  good organic food  in Tryst , you no longer want to return to hormone and pesticide laced food products. The operators of this place are extremely helpfull and accomodating ; it's owner , who introduced himself to our group is very knowlegeable and funny at the same time. I would visit this restaurant everytime I'm in phoenix . My hats off to the staff and food at TRYST."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast. He ordered a Tryst Benedict. Was sub par at best. His bread was dry and his eggs were over cooked, the taste was okay. The coffee tasted quite bitter. I had the banana quinoa pancakes and they were not too bad. I enjoyed the taste but they were over cooked too and almost burned on the under side. I really don't know if I would come back here. The only redeeming factor was the service. It's a little pricey and I was disappointed. Should've gone else where. Oh well, you love and learn."}
{"text":"The food was great and the presentation was fantastic! The service was lacking just a little bit considering it wasn't very busy. I waited at the front for about 4 minutes while two servers took care of a large table and two other servers tried not to make eye contact with me from the back. Finally, one of them approached and I was seated. Nice and airy atmosphere, some TVs for distraction, and a nice vibe. I'll go again."}
{"text":"Went for a visit with my cousin over the weekend and we are always in search of healthy places to eat.  They were not very busy, but possibly because of the early dinner we opted for (4:30pm).  The food was pretty good, not over the moon, but good - we both had salads.  The service was very good, we had a bartender wait on our table and she was very attentive.  I would go back here to meet friends for another visit."}
{"text":"So I work literally two stores down from this place and I've never been here before, yesterday was my first time this place is amazing. I had delicious food, dessert and drinks. I will be back. What really made this place stand out, was not only the delicious, fresh and trendy food, but the amazing and quality customer service from the bartenders and the hostess. They were very informative, knew the menu very well and gave me great advice on what to eat, which is really rare these days since most places do not have this level of exceptional customer service. I will be back! Oh yeah happy hour is from 3-6. The sangria is yummy! The Ruben crisps also yummy. That chocolate pyramid dessert thing I had was just wow!
The prices are fair. I was able to eat like a queen for 25$."}
{"text":"Just ok.  I had the roast beef sandwich which was ok, but a little salty.
Also tried the Ahi salad sandwhich which was a grilled butter bomb.  And tasteless.
Salad was good.
Ribs were OK, nothing special.
Koloa Pork was soaked and oozing in BBQ sauce.  What?  That's not Koloa Pork!  Awful.

The Tilapia taco whatevers as an appetizer were ok, but needed more zing.  

Service was nice enough, but didn't seem like she cared or had any passion.  
good beer was enjoyed though!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on way to meeting.

Had to Yelp because at first thought prices were a bit high.

Turns out chorizo breakfast may be best chorizo I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The steak salad was heavenly.  Huge enough for two people to share.  Tasty steak mixed with organic greens, candied walnuts, fresh tomato and Gorgonzola in a delicious creamy cilantro dressing.  My new favorite meal."}
{"text":"Traveling in from chicago, i was amped up to try everything on the menu. The place is a beautiful spot for a nice night.

We got to sit outside, and enjoy our lovely dinner.

We ordered the bring it on burger, the Buffalo chicken sandwich, with some delicious sides... sweet potato tots and fries. The food was truly amazing, and since everything is grass fed and natural, the flavors were unreal. Highly recommend it.

Lastly, the summer rolls they make, are insanely amazing."}
{"text":"Great new place near Desert Ridge! You've gotta try it! And for all those who are  environmentally aware  they are all organic, locally grown and don't even have paper towels in the bathroom. They even have an extensive gluten free menu. Breakfast/lunch/dinner.  TRY THE SWEET POTATO TOTS, the fresh squeezed (while you wait) Orange Juice and the Creme Brule ....OMG!  Will go back over and over again!  Great place :)"}
{"text":"IM A predominantly gluten free eater, and totally VEGAN. I love Tryst because they literally have so many options to accommodate my lifestyle. RACHAEL is great at recommending options for me! She hustles and I love It!  I highly recommend the veggie stack, beet salad, and brussels sprouts salad. Oh and the COCONUT GROVE cocktail is to die for!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow & wow!!!!
Deliciously tasting food without the guilt! Organic/natural & the fact that it tastes SO GOODDDD. The sweet potato tots are delicious & their salads are HUGE! They come in these massive bowls with so much food in them, it's awesome. The place is super cute & the servers are all pretty great."}
{"text":"The coffee is GREAT! I like coming to Tryst on weekends to sit outside and eat and get a little work done on my iPad or read. The food can be hit or miss. I like getting the spinach omelette with potatoes instead of cottage cheese. Sometimes it's really great and sometimes it's mediocre but I'd say it's better more times than not. The last couple of times we went my boyfriend didn't like his food, but I liked mine and I always get the same thing. 

The hostess is never at the front and isn't the friendliest BUT the wait staff has always always been amazing, even when I've taken their table for 2 hours and only had coffee. Super nice and always makes me experience good."}
{"text":"You had me at \"kombucha on tap\"! Wonderful salads, amazing kombucha and service. My single gripe is that it is very expensive for what you get. It's hard to walk out without spending 20 dollars per person, and the salad portions are not worthy of the cost. The ingredients are very obviously fresh, so I will certainly keep going back. I would just frequent the place more often if it was more affordable."}
{"text":"Went to lunch and after waiting over 45 minutes for our order we asked the manager to check on its status. Instead of checking she began to confront us with a very bad attitude.
After another 15/20 minutes the food arrived with no apology. The food was terrible and the service is the worst I have ever experienced.
There are much better restaurants in the immediate area."}
{"text":"First time there, had a great lunch highly recommend the roast beast and get the sweet potato tots. I will definately be back again."}
{"text":"Went here for a breakfast meeting last week and it was outstanding.  Can't wait to go back!  Great Service! Great food! Great Place!"}
{"text":"We arrived at their opening time of 7am and it wasn't open yet. We waited for about 5 minutes and the girl inside walked up and unlocked it but just walked away. I thought, hmm, shouldn't you open the door and say hello or welcome? 
We were told to sit wherever so we sat at a table where I was facing the door. The lights by the door all kept flickering and shutting off. It was messing with my eyes the entire time. 
We all ordered food with our unpleasant waitress who was the only one there and the one that didn't open the door. She seemed annoyed to have customers.
I ordered a breakfast quesadilla with none of the breakfast stuff, just cheese and peppers and it was good. The coffee was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food.
I don't think I would come back because the service was horrendous. Other people there noticed it as well. The food was good though."}
{"text":"Read all kinds of great reviews on this place, but was disappointed. Cute place. Like the idea of mostly organic food. My husband and I came here for breakfast. He ordered the Monte Christo. I ordered the French toast. The bread was dry and they add orange zest to the batter for the bread although we saw no mention of this on the menu. When the server asked us if we enjoyed the food and we told her it had a different flavor she explained this to us and then said, now you will know for next time. I don't think there will be a next time. Service was slow and I didn't get the beverage I ordered."}
{"text":"From the Bloody Mary, to the Tryst Benedict, to the Tryst Omelet to the Pancakes, the food here is truly mind blowing.  The service was average, but the overall experience has the place as our favorite breakfast joint in the Valley."}
{"text":"My family and I like the food but dislike the service. I'm sorry to say this was our last trip to Tryst. It's a shame too because we live in the Desert Ridge area and like to support small businesses. Tonight was the second time we were seated and did not get a greeting or offered water. We waited 15 minutes and decided to take our business across the street to BJs."}
{"text":"Love this \"new-to-me\" local spot for breakfast, lunch, & dinner!  I have gotten take out and have eaten at the restaurant.  Everytime I have been in, there have been the nicest people working.  Great customer service & very attentive servers.  LOVE their chicken tortilla soup and the hummus trio platter.  You can taste the freshness!  Also, super yummt mimosas for breakfast :)  I love that they have an outside patio to enjoy the nice weather.  The only downside is the size of the restaurant, which is out of their control.  Since it is packed everytime I go there, I do have to wait, but it's worth it for good food and drinks.  
Bottomline: Not many places service natural & organic fare in N. Phoenix, so try it out because the Pita Jungle at desertridge SUCKS."}
{"text":"My favorite quaint breakfast place - love the gluten free menu especially the waffles!!"}
{"text":"The trio hummus appetizer was good, a little on the bland side. but hey, its hummus cant expect a flavor explosion in your mouth. Burger was killer. GET the sweet potato tater tots!!!! The roasted tomato had me seeing angels.  The cupcakes were just ok at best. Definitely not worth the 6 bucks for 3 mini, half a bite chews.  Will be coming back just not for dessert."}
{"text":"After convincing myself that I would go ahead and try to eat something vegetarian (not even vegan) outside the comfort of my own kitchen, I thought I would give this place a try.

To say that it was abysmal would be an insult to abysses (abyssi?)  

They were out of martini glasses.  During happy hour.  So they were more than happy to serve me a cocktail out of a tumbler.  I wish I could say that was the biggest disappointment.  They did not have the drink I wanted, even though it was listed on the menu, and did I mention it was happy hour?  I ended up just getting some water.  I would be grateful for it later as it would help wash down whatever they thought would be passable as an entree.

Truly horrific.  The service was slow.  Very slow.  The place was incredibly empty.  I sat on the patio, among some of the dirtiest fans I have ever seen, and gazed longingly across the walkway at the bustling atmosphere of Humble Pie.  The aroma lingering from there was sadly the highlight of my entire venture to Tryst.  The TV (which is really more of a monitor) was advertising events that happened months ago, so there was no atmosphere to speak of -- besides how filthy the patio was.

After getting my entree, I had to get up and take silverware from another table as our waitress had completely vanished.  I got my workout in, as well, the several times I had to get up and take my water glass back to the bar to have it filled.  

All in all a horrific experience in terms of customer service.  And the food was bland and completely unremarkable in any way.  

I'd avoid this place, and will not be coming back again.  I gave it 2 stars only because I did manage to daydream that I was at the Humble Pie a few times where I was enjoying myself."}
{"text":"We came here after receiving a $20 off $50 coupon at the Local First Fall Festival. We stopped by around 1:30pm on a Monday with the in-laws in tow. The in-laws didn't know that GF meant \"Gluten Free\" so they were in for a surprise... After much indecision, I ordered the Grilled Cheese Sandwich (with 3 types of cheeses, tomatoes, and avocado) and I asked for Bacon on it as well. The husband ordered the Tuna Melt, his sister ordered the Portobello Sandwich, and the in-laws shared the BBQ Bacon Burger. (Some came with salads and others came with fries.) We ordered the Hummus Trio as a starter as well. The in-laws had never had Hummus before and were leery of the delicious dish, but were pleasantly surprised. The trio had red bell pepper, cilantro and regular hummus. All three were delicious and we had to order extra pita. The food came quickly after and everyone enjoyed their dishes. The waitress was really nice and attentive to refilling out water and asking if we needed anything. The place seemed pretty dead, but it was nice sitting on the patio. (I had a nice view of the flat screen over on Humble Pie's patio.) It was nice to try a local business, and while we probably wouldn't have come here except for the coupon, I think we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Please note: This review was from a visit last August that I didn't realize hadn't posted. I considered editing it, since it sounds harsh, but that was how I genuinely felt at the time.

No AC? In August? Are you kidding me? There should have been a sign before you walk in the store that says this, especially considering it had been out, by the server's own admission, for 2-3 days. This shows a complete lack of respect for their customers. For a frame of reference, I am always cold - and I was dying in there. And it wasn't just us - everyone was complaining about it. 

The food was okay but definitely not good enough to overcome the sweltering heat. (It was actually cooler walking out to our car.)

The food alternates between fresh and healthy and cheap, store-bought crap. I had the portobello ciabatta sandwich, which was actually pretty good - light but satisfying with nice flavors. 

My ex got the \"meat-lovers\" omelet. I am vegan, okay, but the (pitiful) amount of meat on this actually made me laugh out loud. 

Also, they advertise as being \"vegan-friendly\", but they really aren't. Aside from the hummus appetizer, I think I had the only vegan thing on the menu. 

Their red potatoes were pretty good. Their house salad was mediocre, at best, but their balsamic dressing was gross - it was literally oil and vinegar with no flavor.

They do have some fabulous tropical green tea, though. I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Cold, dismissive service; French toast blackened on outside and breakfast burrito with lukewarm mystery meat around a wrapped gray egg. This is the second time we tried this place for breakfast. Both times were a disappointment."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical of this place.  But it surprised me with great food.  From our hummus plate & sweet potato tots to the steak and the finish with cheese cake.   It was great.  The only reason I dinged them a star was that the service was a little slow.  Waiting for drinks was a little annoying.  Otherwise the food was too notch!"}
{"text":"I went there on Friday March 10 for lunch by myself. The patio area is super cute and the server was very kind and very quick. I can tell he was quite busy, perhaps the only server on and as someone who's been in the restaurant industry I was really impressed. I had the ahi salad, I think that next time I will order it with dressing on the side, but it was still quite tasty. I'll defiantly go back with friends."}
{"text":"Organic, delicious and friendly service. Got ham and eggs over easy with sourdough. Great meal. Just came off a low carb diet for a few months, what a way to break the low carb fast!"}
{"text":"We needed a spot in a pinch, near our resort. Yelp obliged and we enjoyed!

Tryst is an interesting little restaurant with a clean, comfortable (if cold) decor, tremendous staff and a very simple menu with innovative flavors. 

We were a party of four, and each person ordered a different item for dinner - sausage sub, sausage cheese & macaroni, a buffalo wrap and an ahi tuna melt. Sounds simple, yes, but each plate was prepared with untold originality. And each dish was ... Delicious!

My only dings were - price a little higher than justified for such simple fare, and not all entree dishes (though sufficient in amount and very filling) could pass as a complete meal. 

Thank you Yelp, and Thank you ... Tryst!"}
{"text":"First we ordered drinks and they were all amazing from the Espresso with alcohol to the All Natural Smoothie fruit drinks we ordered.  Next for the STARTERS the TILAPIA CRISPS had so much flavor and where so good that when I got my order of the PORK ADOBO TACOS and could not eat them our waitress replaced them with an order of the PORK ADOBO TACOS. I thought that the PORK ADOBO TACOS said habanero cream it would be a milder form with the habanero flavor, but no these are perfect for those who really like it hot to an extreme! Everything had such good flavor and the service was amazingly the very best!"}
{"text":"Love coming to Tryst because we always know we will enjoy a great meal. Have been here often for breakfast, lunch and dinner and never disappointed. The breakfast omlets are awesome. Especially when paired with the sweet potato tots! If you come for dinner, the fried green beans are a must!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, what a find this was! 

The creative menu will stop you in your tracks. I was paralyzed with indecision for a good 10 minutes, because everything looks AMAZING.

I ended up opting for the Tryst Benedict, which had a sort of Anaheim cream sauce on it, as well as spinach and ham. Though delicious, it didn't deliver enough of a flavor punch (more seasoning? cayenne/arbol pepper?)

My only other grievance was the gravy (yes, a gravy-grievance); it fell in the \"average- below average\" spectrum, tasting heavily of flour and water and not much else (where are the pan drippings at??). Since they make their biscuits homemade, they should also make a homemade gravy IMHO. 

All else considered, this versatile menu has me super excited and looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, nothing that my family and I have tried had tasted bad or even mediocre and they offer a huge organic menu with additional gluten free option for those who have Celiac Disease. 
The staff is always friendly and the place looks clean so i highly recommended this place to anyone ...honestly there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Instead of dining at the JW Marriott, I decided to come here based upon the reviews. I read on the wall they have changing (dinner?) menu diff country per month? I saw happy hour 3-6pm posted too. They had a decent selection of wines and yummy sounding cocktails..too bad it was too early for me to start drinking during brunch. Onto breakfast now.. They have a fairly large selection for breakfast..even house made corned beef hash. They also serve roast red potatoes for their dishes and not hash browns. Too bad because I love crispy hash browns. Only corned beef dishes have sweet potato hash instead of the potatoes. 

What I ordered:
-Kalua pork w rice: great portion size, eggs, eggs cooked correctly as I ordered, decent amount of meat. I focus on ratio because proportion is important since I like a lil bit of everything in each bite! It was difficult to taste the smoke flavor in the pork due to the sauce which was near perfect amount if not slightly too much sauce. It was runny sauce so it fortunately didn't cling too much to the rice or pork. The sauce seemed to be put on the bottom as I noticed when mixing the bowl. The sauce was sweeter than I prefer..almost as sweet as a teriyaki sauce but diff flavor. I almost would like a more savory sauce with a drizzle of the sauce provided. I tried adding salt take it less sweet. 3/5*

-chorizo and eggs w fried tortilla: first off, my husband said it was tasty. But he asked for them to make the chorizo crispy and to cook it longer, and chose scrambled eggs. What he was served was reg cooked moist chorizo (not crisp) with overcooked literally slightly tan in spots, eggs. Luckily it wasn't me that had eggs served like that bc I'd be upset. I think the cook got the egg and chorizo mixed up as in what to cook longer. There was a half tortilla served with it and my husband wished there was at least one whole flour tortilla. The menu stated it's served w beans but he never recieved beans (and I realized this after our meal). It was served w a dollop of sour cream with literally a sprinkle of pico de gallo (6 small pieces of diced tomato which looks pathetic). Probably equivalent to one tiny baby tomato. He said the potatoes were cooked perfectly. They aren't crisp though but soft inside. 3/5* (rating given for flavor and subtracted bc of flaws)

-OJ pricey at $5. No refill that we knew of. Coffee standard $2.90 with refill. 

Overall, decent spot for brunch. I wouldn't go out of my way though. Breakfast is easy to make so I expect each ingredient to be portioned well and cooked to ideal/general if not to customer request."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing breakfast...I'm so excited about this place I am typing up this review as I finish my meal.  My husband and I have recently gone \"organic\" so we have been looking for a breakfast place that catered to this type of clientele.  I had the Hawaiian breakfast that included fried eggs,  fresh roasted pork, cabbage, jasmine rice, fried wontons and a drizzle of soy sauce.  Delish!  I've eaten food in Hawaii and this is exactly what it tastes like!  My husband had the Monte Cristo with strawberry jam at the bottom and if I wasn't soo full from my own meal I'd finish his.  The food came out fast and hot.

I'm contemplating staying here until lunch and eating lunch too, but they may get sick of me so I'll try lunch another day.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious food.  We sat on the patio, which made the experience that much more enjoyable.  If I could choose 6 stars...I would."}
{"text":"Food was great the server Nathalie was cold and standoffish it was hard to get her to interact as an expert of the menu and a smile would have been quite nice.  Otherwise the evening was great"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my friend the other morning last week I think...? and was pleasantly surprised! 
I had been here before for lunch and wasn't happy but their breakfast and service that came with it impressed me.
It seems like a hole in the wall place across from Desert Ridge Marketplace but you should come here and see what they have to offer! MUCH better than Mimis! They don't have a huge menu but the items they do have are good. 
Their coffee and service is good! The coffee doesn't come in a mug, it comes in a glass that looks like it's meant for ice cream sundaes. It doesn't matter, if anything it's a unique touch. I had the pecan French toast and really enjoyed myself. 
Our server was attentive and kept refilling my water and coffee. 
Something else is that she saw we were catching up and having more of a serious conversation so she let us talk interrupted. Most places I feel like servers check on their tables but they're not reading their guest's body language and may interrupt at awkward times. I would much rather have someone check on me than not, but I thought it was very thoughtful she observed that and let us be. She checked on us later though ! It's a small thing but it was very profound! I wish I remembered her name!"}
{"text":"We dined here as a family last year.  I was in the middle of a cleanse and could only eat vegetables, they had the most amazing salad with roasted beets....I was so happy I was able to eat out even while cleansing.  The atmosphere is a little lacking but we were able to sit outside on the patio.  It was pretty empty on a Sunday night, especially compared to Humble Pie next door which was popping.  I appreciate that kids eat free on Sunday (you have no idea how much this helps parents).  We enjoyed our meal and will return if in the area."}
{"text":"We went to Tryst for the first time for the Arizona Breakfast Weekend. I ended up ordering off of that menu, but my family ordered off of the regular menu. I had the sweet potato pancake topped with turkey sausage, bacon and a fried egg. It was good, the pancake was huge and had a pumpkin spice flavor. It was on the sweet side, so the sausage, bacon and egg on top were a nice savory counterpoint. The best part of the Breakfast Weekend menu was the bottomless sangria that came with it! There were of course other non-alcoholic drink options to choose from, but the sangria was really good, nice fresh berries on top too. I had an iced almond milk latte as well, so I was double fisting with the wine and coffee, but it worked! 
The kid's menu is a good deal, for the pancakes, there were 3 good sized pancakes and fruit. 
My husband had the Hawaiian bowl and he really liked it. It had kalua pork over rice with a fried egg! 
Tryst Cafe is a smaller restaurant and they were very busy the morning we went. The waiter was nice and efficient, but a little harried. Overall I liked the restaurant and would go back. Their menu has a healthy focus and there were lots of items I would like to try in the future."}
{"text":"Service is not always great here but the food is consistently delicious. Love the veggie burger. Fresh made sauces and all organic make this place good for your body as well. Best time to go is for lunch. Service sadly decreases at dinner."}
{"text":"In an era where small restaurants come and go Tryst Cafe has remained a constant in the Desert Ridge area. And it's easy to see why. There are always diners inside, but it's never crowded. You can make a reservation on Yelp, but there's rarely a wait. And most importantly; the food is quite good.

When my family feels like going out but can't agree on a place to eat, Tryst always seems to be the place we settle on. The menu hasn't really changed in the more than six years I have live and dined in this part of town, but the food is consistent, and there are monthly specials that range from delicious to at least it was a unique idea.

Lunch and breakfast prices are pretty good. Dinner prices are a little high. But Tryst has been on local dines for as long as I can remember (https://www.localdines.com/Phoenix?ref=19485) with a $30 for $15 gift certificate. Use it and save some cash on some good local fare."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  I love this place.  The food is healthy and fantastic.  The owner, Lisa, is a total doll.  She has the Midwest charm from Chicago.  I frequent."}
{"text":"A small restaurant located just across the street from the Desert Ridge Marketplace (in the Shade shopping center).  The service was very good, but I wasn't super impressed with the food.  The menu did have a nice selection of items ranging from salads to sandwiches to BBQ, but I wouldn't say that I was in love with my order.
I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato tots.  The tots were kind of crispy/kind of not (sad face) but had good flavor and the BBQ sandwich's sauce was lacking in the flavor department.  I only ate about hald of my dinner before becoming disinterested.  My dining partner ordered the pork tacos and he seemed to enjoy them.  
I have heard that Tryst has a pretty amazing breakfast so I will definitely return and give it a try."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here Friday night. We started out with the tilapia crisps appetizer. Pieces of tilapia fried and served with a yummy sauce and vegetables in a crisp wonton wrapper. My husband had the Friday all-you-can-eat fish fry, deep fried cod served with potato pancakes. He said he has had better but it couldn't have been too bad, he ordered seconds. I had the ahi tuna sald which was absolutely delicious, not drenched in dressing which I appreciated. We then shared the creme brulee which was amazing, was served with fresh berries and plate was drizzled with caramel and chocolate. We loved it and will be back soon."}
{"text":"7/28/11

Took Mom here for happy hour, and the whole experience was just 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to three, since the cheese and charcuterie plate was solid, and I was given a second chance at a cocktail (when the first, the mojito, was not very good), so Mom ordered a Bloody Mary, but she didn't like it, either.  We couldn't wait to try the three-hummus plate, but we weren't impressed.  Even the sweet potato tots couldn't cut it.  Just the meat and cheese plate satisfied.  The chocolate chip bread pudding was a HUGE disappointment-- very dry, and not much chocolate flavor.

I don't think I've been back for happy hour..."}
{"text":"This time I didn't ruin Mother's Day by accepting the Bottomless Mimosa Challenge - it was ruined by a disappointing breakfast with slow service. We were seated first out of 3 tables that were waiting to be sat and we were offered drinks last...like the wait was so long my sister got up to ask for some water. They were busy, but not crazy busy and a lot of the tables in our section had been there for awhile. 

When it came to the food, mine was great (breakfast quesadilla for the win) and everyone else's was terrible. My sister's Kaluha Pork was bland and underwhelming; my dads omelette looked like someone in the back was just making egg rounds for them to stick the filling into; and my moms omelette looked like a mushroom instead of a veggie omelette and her potatoes were seriously under cooked. We were too afraid to send anything back because it took so long to get in the first place. This wouldn't have been such a huge disappointment if we hadn't been here before and loved the food.

It's overpriced, not great, and has terrible service - next Mother's Day we're taking our mom to Starbucks because even though she hates coffee, the food is better and she likes their tea."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place for breakfast, had the rancheros and eggs breakfast on my first visit last week and had to stop by again this week for a breakfast burrito.  Both were nothing short of awesome.  I love that there is an outdoor patio seating area that is under shade and the whole place is open air because their doors are always open.  Service was great, its is a tiny place in the corner and the parking can be a struggle but well worth it.  I get sick of the chain places for breakfast and this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch while I was in town visiting. I was impressed with the menu and how basically everything on the menu can be made gluten free (I'm gf and it can be tough eating at restaurants). I will warn that literally almost every gf option comes with an up charge but I kind of expected that. My mom and I sat in their outdoor area but it's covered for \"winter\" lol it was like 75 degrees out and beautiful but it was an airy space which was nice EXCEPT for the fact that the shopping centers \"designated smoking area\" is through sort of like a hallway next to the restaurant and the breeze was blowing the cigarette smell into the patio area. Obviously this is something that the restaurant cannot control, it was just unfortunate. 

I had a salad which was ok, I regretted not ordering some other options that sounded good. It's not that the salad wasn't good, it was good just nothing great. My mom had the biggest omelette I have ever seen. It looked great. Looking around at other people's food- it all looked really good. I will come back here when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Stopped over the other day for a quick breakfast.  The service was good and the place is nice and comfortable.  I was just looking for a little better food.   I had the Meat Lovers omelette and it really had very little in it beyond cheese.  The potatoes were fair maybe a little over seasoned.  For the price there are better choices around."}
{"text":"First of all, my server, Liza, was outstanding. At 7 am, she was bright eyed and energetic! She made sure I enjoyed my meal and kept my coffee cup full. Second, the food here is always fresh. Super delicious! What's more, it's good for you! I will be certain to come back again."}
{"text":"Great gluten free options BUT they charge extra and it was a bit confusing with what thy had to take off what you ordered to make it gluten free, to me if GF is next to it then it should be GF... 

Service was very slow and we were 2 out of 4 people there, we were trying to enjoy our meal and the waiter acted annoyed we didn't want to order entrees right away.. We started with drinks and appetizers 

Good to have a place that cares about organic food nearby... Hoping for a better experience next time..."}
{"text":"I really like the organic food. That being said my organic food has to taste good if it is going to get a good review and this one does. Really like the breakfast here (haven't tried lunch or dinner). They have good coffee and really good bacon. We have been many times and enjoy it. It makes our rotation periodically on the weekends. The downfall here could be their service. For such a small place it should not be hard to have a few great servers. We have been pretty lucky but have seen others struggle."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast/brunch with an emphasis on sustainable/local products.  The sweet potato tots, like everyone says, are quite tasty.  I tried the Hawaiian breakfast ($11) which came out on a fancy, modern white bowl, quite possibly the most chic looking breakfast I've had.  The breakfast was a huge portion that I could only finish half of.  I'm not sure if it's actually what Hawaiians would have for breakfast, but for me, while each ingredient was well prepared, it seemed like it was just a fancy looking kalua pork rice bowl with eggs on top."}
{"text":"Tremendous food and atmosphere.  Very popular so I suggest that you make a reservation.  This review is only for the Brunch/Lunch.  However I would love to see how they do dinner.  The cocktails sound absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"What's better than a great juice burger and knowing it's free range/no antibiotics!? 

I've been to tryst a couple times now and I've been very impressed. Great food, great service great location!

I am always looking for places just like this that is organic and free range. Especially with tasty ingredients. I have yet to have their breakfast but I have only heard good things! 

I hate getting a burger from a chain restaurant and knowing at the end of my meal it was full of hormones and crap. 

They have a gluten free menu and a happy hour! This place is worth trying."}
{"text":"Pleasantly pleased with food, ambience and service.  Very good.  Had steak salad for dinner which was fresh and delicious.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian breakfast is the best, it's a must try. We love the healthy options on this menu."}
{"text":"I almost didn't go because of the bad reviews from yelp. Im glad I did go. I eat red meat about once a month and when I do it's organic. They have all natural beef so since I was craving a good burger I ordered it. With cheese lettuce tomato and onion. Cheese was extra, that's ok , but they charged for the onion. Didn't know it till we got the bill. Not that we can't afford.50 but come on . I also got a side salad with the burger . It all was very yummy.I'm choosy about my regular iced tea, they have very clear good tea. My friend who took me had organic chicken tortilla soup and she liked it. We topped it off with their delicious carmel cheesecake. Great food and good service. I will go back for sure. Gonna try breakfast then dinner menu. Don't know who these people are (complainers) that panned the place but it's not true. The place is worth trying out for yourselves."}
{"text":"I die for this place! It's so good, literally everything on the menu is amazing! Everything tastes super fresh and this place is a big reason why I moved from SD to PHX! Haha not really, but this place really is delish!"}
{"text":"Looking for a mid-morning farm-to-table foodie adventure? You gotta check out Tryst. 

I'm not a big fan of eggs bennie but OMG, Tryst's bennie sauce is light, they use prusciutto in place of ham and moist buffalo mozzarella...amazing!!

If you're hungry and want something with a little more kick...you gotta try their breakfast burrito...with chorizo! Need I say more?!

And what would a brunch be without a great choice between a mimosa or bloody mary. They really didn't leave much else to want for brunch.

Oh and most importantly...you will want to give them a call to get on their wait list, especially if you like to sit outside in their covered patio. They'll even crank up their heaters if it gets too chilly.

I'd give them the 5th star but have not been impressed with the early weeknight dinner wait...too long! Hope they get that one turned around soon. I'll will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"The decision to try Tryst Cafe was not one of my own, however I am glad it was made.  They have a fairly small and simple menu, with very interesting choices.

For our starter we tried the summer rolls and beer battered green beans.  The summer rolls were good, but not nearly as amazing as the beer battered green beans!  They were absolutely amazing!  (and devoured by my whole family).  For my main entr√©e, I played it safe with the Beef Burger.  The burger was good, however they overcooked mine and that was a bit disappointing.  Though I played it safe, my whole family loved all of there choices!  

You will see my return factor will be somewhat low, but only due to the limited menu options of my liking (again, I'm more of a bar food guy) I am however craving those green beans!  So you never know! 

Return factor- 45%"}
{"text":"Well it didn't start off too good. We were not served for some time even though it did not seem busy. It was hot but there were a few tables full outside!  Diane's Mojito was not very memorable because it had no mint taste, but the very helpful waitress did bring more. I had the Ahi tuna salad which was very good and Diane had the Beet salad which was also good except for the Salmon she had with it which was much too salty. Their IPA was very good and we shared a crime br√ªl√©e which was delicious. The very friendly and helpful waitress even spoilt me with a fresh brewed coffee to go when I asked her to heat up the coffee she brought me originally.
Overall a nice place and friendly staff and reasonably priced.
Second visit with Mike and Karen - written up by Head Office.
I ordered the Friday fish fry as the waitress told me how good it was. I was very disappointed as the fish was over cooked and chewy.  I should have known from the presentation. it was hard to tell it was even cod,shaped like a sausage and sitting on a soggy piece of lettuce.
The potato cakes were tasty and I was so hungry I ate most of the fish. The sangria was very heavy - gave me a headache - not light and fruity the way I like sangria.  
Our friends were not very impressed with the steak in their steak salad and didn't get it cooked the way they ordered.
Our waitress was very nice and friendly but I'm afraid she couldn't make up for the unappetizing food.


I wanted to give Tryst another chance after our first visit with the much too salty salmon, but I certainly won't be going there again."}
{"text":"We had come here previously and had a great meal. However, this morning we had an opposite experience. We ordered our food, drinks, etc at the same time - well before the restaurant became crowded. Long story short, ended up waiting an hour for our food, which ended up being not exactly what we ordered, and cold. Such a bummer because many in our party are gluten free and this restaurant is one of the only options in the area. Not trying to dissuade anyone from trying this place, just wanted to share our experience, unfortunately it was a bad one."}
{"text":"We were 2 adults and 3 kids for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The indoor seating area is small, but we were accommodated. We were greeted quickly and the kids ordered hot chocolate. 

So far, so good. Next we ordered from the kid menu, pancakes and bacon. Adults ordered Monte Cristo  and eggs. From that point on, service was slo-o-ow. When food finally arrived @ 25 minutes later, pancakes were cold and rubbery. Eggs, bacon and toast arrived on 3 separate plates, and cold as well, and toast wrong. It also turned out that they were charged separately as the waitress did not mention there was an alternative to order as a complete dish. 

All in all, this 'Tryst' was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last Sunday morning and service was horrible. Blonde waitress never checked back on us after getting food. My food was cold- how is it cold, your restaurant just opened for he day!? I had to ask a food runner or another waitress to heat up my food (after I ate almost 1/2 cus I was hungry but couldnt find the waitress). 
Only saw waitress return to bring check. Then took her 15 min to come back and get the payment. Overpriced mediocre food with crappy service.
On a side note, how do you have a kids menu, high chairs, but no changing table in the bathroom? Common, spend the $100 or so to put one in. This really is a big deal to parents and your restaurant is in family community."}
{"text":"Tryst is a great spot for breakfast/brunch. I love their sweet potato tots, veggie omelets and thick applewood bacon. They also do a mean bloody mary and boast an amazing Organic Liquor section. I need to go back during the evening to check out their flavored vodkas.

My boyfriend has not been so lucky, he has had to send food back twice. The first time it was for a steak that was brought out bloody when he ordered it medium rare. The second time was ridiculous, he ordered eggs over hard and they came out runny, he sent them back and they came back BLACK. I didn't think it was possible to burn and egg like that.

So 3.5 stars for Tryst as long as you don't piss off the cook!"}
{"text":"I went to Tryst Cafe to meet a friend for breakfast.  I ordered the Breakfast Burrito and my friend ordered two scrambled eggs and toast.  The food took about 30 minutes to be served, which seemed a little long for breakfast.  My burrito was just ok.  The chorizo was extremely greasy (dripping down my hand as I bit into the burrito).  The side of roasted potatoes was flavorful, although a little cold and the avocado was brown on the edges.  
The server asked if we wanted hot sauce or ketchup, to which my friend asked for the hot sauce.  She ate half of her scrambled eggs before he returned.  Then she had to ask for jam for her toast. 
Overall, Tryst was just ok.  I really have no inclination to return."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast this past Saturday after my boyfriend stopped in for lunch on Friday afternoon. He said he had an amazing pulled pork sammie and sweet pot tots, and this place had been on our\" weekend breakfast out\" radar for a while, so we stopped in.

We got there around 9:30 and had a short (less than 5 minutes) wait. There were a few tables open, but I honestly appreciate places that don't overwhelm their staff by rapidly seating all their tables. It makes for a much easier experience. The patio was packed and there was a giant table of about 10 ladies having a pre-Mother's Day gathering, so I can understand why staff might have been busy. We were sat in kind of a precarious location between two parties right in the partition between the inside and patio, but hey, it was a table.

My iced coffee was delicious, and our server was very quick with refills for both iced and regular coffee for the bf. We both ordered the Tryst omelet (which seemed popular--I heard the ladies at the table next to us order it.) which is filled with fresh mozz, roasted tomatoes and pesto. He kept the sweet potato tots, I subbed fruit for mine. (I'd just ran for 31 minutes straight, I needed to pretend to be healthy.)

The omelets were stuffed and delicious. The mozz could have been just an eensie bit more melted but the roasted tomatoes were stupid good! The lil fruit cup was tasty, with fresh orange segments (juicy!), pineapple, honeydew and melon. And of course I stole a few tots, which were tasty as expected.

I really liked this place, but the prices seemed a little bit steep for breakfast. However, I definitely want to try dinner and some of their drinks. I like the organic focus that seemed to be throughout all the menus. Tryst was a good change of pace and we'll be back to try new things!"}
{"text":"I had the best Eggs Benedict of my life here.  Seriously.  Snazzy, mod interior, and good coffee too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate a birthday on a Sunday when they originally had Sunday afternoon specials - they used to have 1/2 price apps & desserts on Sunday afternoon but they no longer have these specials, which is a bummer because the price of the apps are expensive without the discount.  They were very nice, we sat on the patio the wind was fierce and the awning kept falling they need to find something to hold it down, it hit a few people sitting on the patio.  The waitress was real nice.  The green bean & sweet potatoe apps were very good.  Plus the Turkey burger with the brie and jam was one of the better burgers I have tasted 100 times better than indulge or zinburger.  They are a little on the expensive side and without the really good discounts they had when they originally opened now gone.  We will not be going back - the cons are they do not answer their emails nor answer ??? on their facebook fan page.  You can get a 10% discount still I believe if you check in with foursquare but if you do not have that app on your cell phone you are out of luck."}
{"text":"Great food. Went there for the first time and I ordered the chorizo and eggs. I asked if they could substitute the fried eggs for scrambled egg white and they did.  Delish!!!  My son ordered the whole wheat pancakes with blueberries and chocolate chips and he said they were the best. We will def be coming here again."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation, inventive and many GF options. The GF cinnemon roll was very tasty but needed to be a tad bit warmer."}
{"text":"Atmosphere : traditional modern diner
Staff: great. Very attentive and nice 
Food: to die for. I had the chorizo and eggs and it was so tasty. The beans I didn't care for but that's a personal preference. The coffee was also so tasty and the presentation is nice.  
Would I recommend to a friend : YES
Would I return : yes ! I want to return for the brunch !"}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant for breakfast or lunch! I've had breakfast several times and enjoyed the bacon/eggs, oatmeal, and beef sandwich!! I really think I enjoy it most because it's not a chain restaurant and the staff & food are really good!"}
{"text":"unique, delicious choices with plenty of healthy options. Baked brie with fig jam is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Omg!  The French toast Monte Cristo is to die for!   I just feel like I'm on vacation when I come here!  (Even though I work across the street).  It's a perfect vacation breakfast with a Bloody Mary!  Or a quick vacation from work across the street."}
{"text":"I really am a fan of breakfast, so I am always on the hunt for a breakfast spot that has not only yummy food but some ambiance.
Tryst satisfied both-but lacked in a couple of things.
I like that everything is fresh and organic for the most part. It's an interesting menu, but a very small menu.
I had the huevos rancheros. We sat inside because the patio was completely full.
The service was good-though our drinks were never refilled. Bummer.
I love that they serve your coffee in a clear mug. Fun.
The presentation of the food was also lovely.
The only reasons I'm not giving it 4 stars is because of the limited menu  and like I said, our drinks were never refreshed-and it took quite some time for us to get our bill.
Definitely worth a try for breakfast-we'll be going back to try dinner at some point."}
{"text":"Tryst Cafe is easily accessible as it's right off of 101, but I'll admit that it's slightly hidden as it's in a strip mall across from the Desert Ridge Shopping Center. Their goal is to serve tasty locally and organically sourced foods.  In addition they have several vegan friendly options on their menu.

When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the upscale, yet relaxed atmosphere.  With the ability to sit at the bar, sit inside at a table, or even outside, you have multiple options to choose from.

Per their website wine and beer tasting is available along with a daily happy hour.  In addition, live in-house entertainment is provided on Monday nights.  I could definitely see myself chilling out on a Monday night, eating some food and listening to relaxing music in an atmosphere found at Tryst.

Having conversed with Tryst Cafe on Twitter I knew exactly what my vegan options were and decided on the Hummus Trio, Desert Ridge Spring Rolls, and GTs Kombucha tea.

Each portion was beyond tasty.  If you like hummus, you'll love the trio option.  As for the rolls, I've never had anything like it but REALLY like them. With the mango they had a slight sweetness but the dipping sauce provided a tiny kick that was complimenting to the rolls.

With prices ranging between $6.25-$10 for lunch I found it was affordable and worth the price for the portions we received."}
{"text":"Okay:  Try to get Sam as your server as she seems to be terrific!  Some are slower and just plain not up to the challenge!  My suggestions are:  Anything made with Jewel's Cupcakes (see their yelp entry!)  items!  This includes the Monte Cristo sandwich Gluten Free, GF French Toast, etc.  They may have some of her desserts as well.  GET THEM!

The sweet potato tots are like little pieces of melt in your mouth goodness!!!!  My daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes and my husband had the breakfast burrito.  It's a little spendy so I probably wouldn't go here weekly but for excellent gluten free choices with TASTE........it can't be beat.

The patio is pleasant and the Iced Tea is good.  Give it a try.........especially if you're GF."}
{"text":"Tryst Was a nice little surprised for dinner. The service was solid and the food was good. My wife loved her salad and I enjoyed my Buffalo chicken sandwich was devoured and I would absolutely get it again. I want to try it for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe, it is relaxing.  I like to go for breakfast, their omelets are great and not of ridiculous size.  Breakfast Sammie's are good too.  I always ask for my eggs to be a bit well done and they get it right every single time.  

They have great coffee and fresh orange juice.

They have great sangria too!

The only real drawback is that sometimes there are a lot of kids there on the weekend for breakfast so it can be loud on the patio....but not always.

Not a huge menu, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch awhile back... Lunch was tasty. The menu had so many things I wanted to try for brunch and lunch. It was smaller but nice and clean inside."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Tryst Cafe for 7 years now. It is my go to place. I love it and my friends and family love it. The atmosphere is so nice and welcoming. Great selection for anyone with dietary restrictions and they staff is also very knowledgeable about their menu. Perfect place to go for a nice breakfast or lunch and even a casual meeting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So we came here on a whim after staying at a friends and were really happy with the experience. Parking was a bit tight to park right nearby and there is a Starbucks near be main entrance with a drive through line that backs up - sometimes blocking the entrance. 

The inside is a bit small but has a nice feel and setting. There is a pretty nice patio outside, which is covered and has heaters and good seating. We sat inside for our visit. 

I started with an iced coffee which was pretty good with a good taste and was just strong enough. It comes with a little container of fresh cream to add. 

I got a breakfast quesadilla which was excellent and my girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich. Both were great with excellent taste and presentation. I bet there many other gems on the menu too! 

Overall this place was great. Glad we found it and made the last minute stop to grab some food. We would definitely come back again and enjoy another  selection off the menu!"}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 if possible but not so 3 it is. 

I've been here multiple times and it's not the food that keeps me coming back... It's the mimosas! Drinking aside, the food is okay and the service is fair at best. 

The staff is always pleasant, but during half of my visits here  I've had to sit around and wait for over an hour after ordering food.

 I have tried the Benedict which was flavorless and cold, but it's quite possible it sat around for many minutes before making it to my table. The steak and eggs were ok, but the eggs were not cooked properly and this was after waiting over an hour for food. I have also had the beef beast, which was actually very tasty and I did like the breakfast nachos, as well.

The coffee is extremely watery and was disappointing. I have also tried a latte here, but it didn't taste right. I cannot be sure but it tasted like there was almond milk in it so I wouldn't try it again. 

I really want to love this place, but basically it's a breakfast place I go to when I really just want to have a drink in the morning"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and it's one of few restaurants I feel comfortable enough with the quality of food to feed to my child. Wait is never long to get seated and food is always great.
My only complaint is that sometimes the staff seem rushed (which is odd because there are always 2 or 3 staff members just standing around) so I can end up waiting longer than most places for my check, food or drink refill.

Overall food rating would be 5 stars
Overall service rating would be 3 stars"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is horrible. When Tryst Caf√© opened up 3 years ago or so it was amazing, everything was great. For some reason maybe management changed, new staff, who knows...it's horrible. I found more than 3 hairs in my food, the service was extremely slow despite the fact that there were only 3 tables filled. I took my parents there because it was (I thought it still was...) awesome, and it was quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"We had really good service tonight and very little wait for our food which is nice for a Friday night.  It's nice to have a place to eat that serves food with a higher standard of ingredients."}

{"text":"Great fresh flavorful food and great service. Also good, smooth coffee. I'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"Had the chipotle veggie burger with sweet potato tots... by far the best veggie burger i've ever had! Also, the house pinot noir (only $5 during happy hour) was really nice and smooth. I am definitely going back, so many good options on the menu!"}
{"text":"I actually looked up a place to have breakfast since I was on this side of town. We went in and found a table outside. It was supposed to rain and I thought it was cool they had plastic see through curtains with heaters on the patio. The server, Jeremy was really helpful and quick. The food came out quickly and was great. My husband got the flapjacks and I got the Tryst breakfast with shoestring fries. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. I can't wait to try this place for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Tryst Cafe for some time now...ever since reading about it in Phoenix Magazine. We called ahead to make reservations and while the hostess was extremely polite, she asked if we had a \"Travel Zoo\" coupon. Well, I couldn't understand what she had said because she talked so fast but that was fine...I didn't have a coupon. So, we get to the restaurant and we are sat outside immediately. We looked over the menu awaiting our waitress and were impressed with the variety of options, especially the GF options. We wanted to look at the drink menu but weren't given any so we just had to await the waitress. Well, about 10 minutes later, the waitress, who had been at all of the other tables, came over asking if we had a \"Travel Zoo\" coupon. Again, she said it so fast, I had no idea why they were so interested if we had a coupon; she did explain that the coupon apparently expired that night so they wanted to see if I had one. Ok, she asked if we wanted a drink because it was before 7:00 and happy hour was still on. Since we didn't have a drink menu, she got us one. 

I ordered the Sangria (hh price $5 she said); my husband ordered a Apple Cider drink ($2 off normal price she said). Drinks came out and while very good, my husband's glass was covered in dry food - obviously not clean so he asked for another drink. It came out about 5 minutes later and the waitress made it clear that the dirty glass wasn't her fault...the bartender's fault. This drink was watered down so it seemed reasonable to assume that they might have simply poured his drink into a clean glass. At that point, we weren't feeling too great about our restaurant pick but we pushed on. 

Food comes out and it looks delicious. The food was very good and I enjoyed the meal as did my husband; however, his meal was dripping grease (burger) and was difficult to put down once he started eating it. He certainly had to wash his hands after finishing because he was drenched in grease. Unfortunately, he felt quite ill after and into the evening. I don't think there was anything necessarily wrong with the meal, but the amount of grease was simply overwhelming. 

We got our bill and our hh drinks that were supposed to be on discount, weren't; in fact, my Sangria was more expensive than the menu quoted. We watched what appeared to be a manager walking around asking customers about their meals so we anticipated him asking us as well but that never happened. I wonder if he could tell we didn't like it and didn't feel like hearing about it. I wonder if he'll hear about it now that I've taken 10 minutes to type out my experience. We didn't mention the incorrect prices because we just wanted to leave. 

So, I'm left with...the food was decent; drinks not so much, service fine but nothing spectacular...will absolutely not go back and will make sure that others know what to expect if they decide to go."}
{"text":"1st time here great little place. We had an amazing breakfast...Super Kale Omelet and the breakfast Nachos. A definite go back-and introduce friends to this place the portions are pretty large I couldn't even finish all of my Omelet . And the prices are very reasonable I'll have to come-back and try the lunch This place is really good if you are wanting gluten free as well."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Came in for a late breakfast, they serve breakfast until 2pm.  We were staying at Canyon Villas and have been getting up late on our vacation.  Husband and I had omelets both delicious and Almond crusted French toast.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Eat here.
Had breakfast here.  F...ing wonderful.
Service was a little slow, but food was \"creative.\"
Read the menu.  Offerings spanned the spectrum. 
I had the Hawaiian Breakfast, and tried it without any subs.  Holy shit! Was delicious \"as is.\" Cool bowl, rice, blanched cabbage, smoked pork, fried egg.  Seriously? Hawaiians eat like this (i don't think so). Y.U.M.M.Y.
Wish i could upload a photo I took.
My lover had a Monte Cristo plate.  French toast, ham, gruyere cheese, and get this....Yam tater tots.  Yes, yam tater tots.  Super yummy.
This cafe took over Celcius (wonderful sushi restaurant). I hope the folks of Desert Ridge area support this local establishment and eat hear often, because us Cave Creekers need somewhere to eat!  So unless you want to be relinquished to eat shit at Sweet Tomatoes or TGI Fridays, eat here.  Not expensive and really, good, food.
OK, this place is like the Good Egg (which I love), but uber yummy and CREATIVE (at least for breakfast)."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with unique southwestern flavors, plus lots of gluten free options. Service was friendly and prompt. We will return when back in this part of town."}
{"text":"Tryst, our appointed place for breakfast . On Tatum, South of Deer Valley.

Hidden away in a little mall across the street from Desert Ridge Mall next to Starbucks. My gal and I both loved the interior design. Tall exposed ceilings, lovely calming colors, comfortable seating. Our server was charming.

Coffee was served in tall glass mugs, a great way to do java. We laughed and chatted and before we were finished it was time to eat. I tried the tryst veggie omelet. A three egg, roasted pepper, spinach, mushroom, grilled onion and yellow chedder with roasted red potatoes. 9. My GF had the same. We both loved the omelets.

Tryst believes in organic, hormone free, natural and local. ^5's my friends!"}
{"text":"Great menu options! The steak salad was very filling and fresh. The happy hour pricing made it easier to eat healthy and organic on the go without breaking the bank. Service was adequate but the food is the real star here. The candied walnuts were beyond amazing! Only thing I'd wish was a little more clear would be if certain menu items are completely organic or just some of the ingredients. Overall great concept and will be returning."}
{"text":"Artichoke dip and chicken satay apps on special for happy hour. Plus excellent $5 wine and music Monday's. Loved it."}

{"text":"Just LOVE this super cute place!  Excellent service, lots of menu options and you can't beat mimosas and bloody Mary's.  Server was great at changing up menu items to make them more plant based/vegan for me.  They had almond milk for coffee, etc.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was sent back and it still didn't come out right.  The eggs were intended to be over medium but the egg whites were runny. Lattes were $6 and tasted like coffee with cream. 

Service was decent, very nice waitress!

Maybe try lunch or dinner, breakfast was definitely lacking."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food is great, usually go for the breakfast. Breakfast burrito with sweet potato tater tots is terrific. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Great choice if your in the desert ridge area of Phoenix."}

{"text":"Breakfast was good.  My omelet was overdone, but still tasted good.  The service was good and the staff is always very accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm going to post a rare review in that I didn't go for breakfast, but rather dinner.  And I can say with absolute certainty that it's worth every penny.

We got the beer battered green beans as an appetizer and it was delicious.  Crispy and lightly fried on the outside but you could still taste the crunch and the freshness of the green bean on the inside.  Really good.

Meals came out as: baby back ribs w/ sweet potato fries, cornish hen, and seared ahi tuna salad.  I had a bit of each and they were all very flavorful, and more importantly, the price point was great considering that this is all organic and locally sourced!  Sweet potato fries were the major selling point though...

You have to get the bread pudding for dessert.  It wasn't overwhemingly sweet, and was hot and had little pockets of crispy texture interspersed with the soft texture of the bread pudding.  Caramel drizzled on top and on the plate.  

All in all, a fantastic place to go to for dinner and this only makes me want to come back for breakfast/brunch considering how good dinner was."}
{"text":"This is a small little brunch spot hidden across the street from Desert Ridge.  I stopped in here with a friend after a fun hike up Piestewa Peak to refuel and recharge, and what a great idea it was!

The hostess situation was a little strange, it took us a while to get seated as it seemed like the hostess was in charge of seating people and getting the tables ready, which appeared to be a little overwhelming for the one girl at the hostess table, and I have to agree.

Barring that brief inconvenience, the rest of the experience was great.  I ordered the veggie omelette, which was a fantastic choice.  It was loaded with delicious spinach, large slices of mushroom, and yummy cheese.  It came with some great house potatoes and wheat toast.  I couldn't dream of much better!

Our waitress and her service was also incredible.  After sitting down we got our drinks at light speed and after we ordered, our food was delivered in less than ten minutes, which I was completely amazed and impressed by.  High marks for the staff there that day!

The atmosphere inside is trendy and similar to that of Snooze, the local brunch hot spot at Kierland Commons.  Except where the wait for Snooze usually exceeds one hour, Tryst had us seated in five minutes.  I'll be back here for sure, such a great Sunday breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Consistent quality in customer service and the food. This is my new favorite place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice place, little pricey, everything is organic including the beer!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Great Service. Great Food. The Hawaiian Bowl is Da bomb!!
Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"it took a little while to get our server but once we did we all enjoyed our breakfast.  i ordered the french toast and there were 3 half slices.  yum!  it was about $10.  would go back."}
{"text":"My partner wanted to go out for breakfast and suggested Mimi's since it's close to the house. Being the easy going kind of guy I am I agreed, although I'm not a Mimi's fan. 

I would much prefer Butterfield's, Butter's, Arcadia Cafe, The Vig Uptown, etc, etc.

We walked into Mimi's and there was a HUGE wait. No thank you, we immediately turned around and walked out. Luckily or I guess unluckily I remembered Tryst had opened up across the street, so off we went.

Tryst is a pretty small spot, unless you count the patio area, in the tiny cramped Shade shopping center across the street from Desert Ridge. Whoever the heck designed this little mall and the Desert Ridge needs to go back to design school to learn how many parking spots to include in a shopping center.

Oh yeah, this is supposed to be a review about the restaurant. Luckily we found a place to park and they had a couple tables inside and we were seated immediately. The bus boy immediately brought water, score one point, and shortly thereafter our waiter came by to check on us. Oddly enough the people across from us were seated before us, but were not waited on until after us, by our same waiter. Spotty service...pay attention here folks. We both ordered ice tea and omelets.

The omelets came quick, but were switched. Since they were very similar we didn't notice right away, but discovered it shortly into the meal. Both egg dishes were tasty and the redskin potatoes were excellent. 

Twice towards the end of our meal, but not before we were finished the waiter and then the bus boy came by and asked if we were done. NO, I just took a bite of my food, I'm chewing and there's still food on the plate. Keep your mitts of my plate! Annoying as heck.

Now comes the bill. I don't always check and the total seemed fine, but then I noticed I was charged $10 for my breakfast. I clearly remember the menu said it was $9. Okay, okay it's only a dollar, but I asked anyway. The waiter checked and sure enough I was right. But here comes the kicker. He comes back and explains that $10 WILL BE the new price on the new menus. WTH? If you're gonna raise the price do it AFTER the menus are printed...NOT before!

I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Items selected include:

Coffee

Monte Cristo with two French Toast slices, ham, Gruyere, strawberry jam with sweet potato tots and organic ketchup

Pineapple Upside Down Pancake

PB&J French Toast on Brioche

Located close to my then-sublease and featuring a menu annotated as organic along with praise from local magazines Tryst Caf√© seemed like a good choice for my first breakfast in town  and with interesting options on both the sweet and the savory side we arrived early to find the space as well as the service to be warm and inviting.  Seated on entry and presented with menus, water, and gratuitously refilled fair trade coffee (bring your own artificial sweetener if you don't fancy stevia) from a pleasant and efficient woman named Joanna who was seemingly running the show solo the meal most certainly started out well...at least until the food arrived.

Featuring a frequently changing selection of items based on what is fresh and local I have to commend Tryst for offering a multitude of options catering to a variety of dietary restrictions, but on the whole the only item which was tasted that really impressed was the French Toast; a hard to mess up amalgam of rich peanut butter and jam on eggy brioche that was pan seared golden and quite good even though the fruit cup lacked flavor aside from the overwhelming melon.

Moving past the toast, I guess the tots were as good as you can do with fried potatoes - a light sweetness, though some a bit overcooked - but the flavorless and watery ham on the Monte Cristo and the single ring of too-dull-to-taste Pineapple cooked into the base of a pancake no better than Bisquick left much to be desired.  Unique enough as an option for persons with food allergies or restrictions I certainly see a place for Tryst Caf√© in the local food scene - just not in mine, not considering the overall quality Phoenix's breakfast/brunch scene and organic/healthy/vegan spaces like Herb Box or Nami"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they are refilling their ketchup bottles with something other than Heinz. The bottle was filled almost to the top, and yet the label was worn and the sell by date was nowhere to be found. Isn't it a health code violation to continue using a bottle....especially if they're refilling with a brand other than Heinz? It made us question how many other corners are being cut. No complaints about our appetizer or entrees; however the desserts left something to be desired."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch with two friends. I had the GF Eggs Benedict and really enjoyed it. The sweet potato tots were really good. I loved that they offered so many GF options, as I am gluten intolerant. One friend had the Monte Cristo and said that it was too much bread, not enough filling, and felt the raspberry jam should have been served on the side. My other friend enjoyed her eggs and potatoes. The coffee was really good and I was impressed that they serve stevia and not aspartame. We waited about 5 minutes for a table at about 10 am and it was quite busy. Food came out timely and our server was attentive. Overall I enjoyed the food and the ambiance and would go back again. My friend with the Monte Cristo would go again and try something different."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!!!! I have had  so many delicious meals here, made with real foods that are made from scratch. Every time I go, I try something new and everytime am amazed that it is sooo yummy! The service is friendly and efficient without being fake. They are truly nice and happy people."}
{"text":"Overpriced, low quality food, and a  creepy vibe. This spot is trying too hard to be health conscious and they fail horribly.   How can you be a health conscious restaurant that has \"organic\" all over thr menu and sell 40 to 50% maple syrup and not 100 pure maple syrup?! Get the f*** out of here.  What is the other 60% made of? High fructose corn syrup? Also,  how can you promote menu items that are gluten free when you don't even know if the items are cooked in seperate cookware from the non gluten items. I ordered the gluten free brioche french toast, it tasted more like pound cake then french toast. And the nerve of them to charge me $11 for it and to put the icing on the cake, $ . 50  for 4 sliced almonds  that look like it came out of a bag from Walmart. They charged me $5 for fresh pressed orange juice this s*** taste like it came out of a Tropicana carton! This spot can play this game with other people, but come on son, for extremely food conscious people like myself.. its just not happening. This place gets two thumbs down and a smack in the face for trying to pimp this garbage ass food."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, never disappointed.  (only for breakfast)

I'm a breakfast fanatic, it's my favorite meal to eat out.  Breakfast sandwich is a good size.  Husband had the Hawaiian Breakfast, and he could barely eat it all.  Tater tots are crisp and delicious and I'm not a big tater tot person.  Nice patio, relaxing and enjoyable."}
{"text":"It was definitely a pleasant surprise the first time ventured into Tryst Cafe.  Everything was so fresh, delicious, perfectly cooked, and the portions were substantial.   The restaurant has very spacious, wide open layout with trendy tables/seating in the patio area.   If you are at Desert Ridge, skip the chain restaurants, and head over to Tryst Cafe instead!   

- Hummus Trio (traditional, cilantro, and red pepper) come with fresh Pita or cucumbers (Gluten Free).   
- Tryst Ahi Tuna salad - Excellent portion and very fresh.  I would just ask for extra dressing on the side.
- Portobello Sandwich - It was very juicy, tasty and satisfying.  The grilled bell peppers and Portobello will fall off of your sandwich. 
- Monte Cristo (two French toast slices, ham, Gruyere cheese topped with strawberry jam) - it is not greasy, and melted perfectly with the Gruyere cheese.  
- Sweet potato tots are the best!  Try dipping with hummus dips if you have any left.  Skip the regular ketchup.

What a deal!  All food and drinks are half off 3-6 everyday.  After 5PM receive 2 for 1 cocktails."}
{"text":"SERVICE:  Our server Brianna was rude and sarcastic.  We explained it was our first time and in most cases servers are extremely friendly and helpful. We asked what she would recommend and was told anything with a green leaf symbol next to the item. That didn't answer out question as to what SHE would recommend. Then she was argumentative when my husband reminded her that he requested salad to be tossed. She explained with a very sarcastic tone and condescending facial expression that the lettuce was tossed but not the rest of the ingredients (chicken, cheese, etc.) Almost every place we've had salads and asked for it to be tossed, they toss everything and not just the lettuce. I was concerned that she might have spit or done something horrible to his salad because that's how perturbed she was.

FOOD:  Overall, my husband did enjoy the salad.  Flavor was good but portion was on the smaller side.  Unlike the portion you would get from Yard House, Cheesecake Factory, to name a few.

I had the roast beef sandwich which was ok. Beef was very dry and a little grizzly. If you want the best roast beef sandwich in the area, go to Salty Sow!  Service is excellent there too!

Fortunately, we purchased a Travelzoo deal because we would not have wanted to pay full price for the mediocre experience.  Travelzoo was so kind to reach out to me via phone and email regarding my negative experience.  They sent me a gift card towards future Travelzoo deals which was totally unexpected and much appreciated!!

Would we return to Tryst Cafe?  We believe in giving any place a second chance.  So yes, but next time we will ask for Dan who was the total opposite of Brianna (super friendly, quick and responsive to our requests, great attitude, and smiled).  Not sure if Brianna was having a bad day or if this is just who she is as a person but definitely should not be in any industry dealing with customers.  Management should highly consider have her assist in the back.  Hopefully, she isn't the manager.  LOL!!"}
{"text":"Yelp seemed to let me down a little bit with this one. After some shopping at desert ridge we decided to try this place since it's across the way and away from the craziness a little. Good reviews and what appeared to be an appetizing menu, I was sold. 

The place is pretty small, with a small patio as well. We were seated outside immediately but had to wait for a little bit for our waiter to appear. He brought waters and apologized for the wait, so all was good..

We got the grilled cheese, which came with avocado and tomato and fries as the side. Also got the yogurt parfait and a scrambled egg. The food was just... ok. The grilled cheese itself was fine but the fries were lukewarm and I wasn't crazy about the breading. The yogurt parfait was again just alright. The egg was good. I think this place is supposed to be more organic/healthy and maybe it was just an off visit since we didn't order anything elaborate but for the price it was simply not worth it. 

The service was friendly but a bit slow for the amount of people in the restaurant.. it was certainly not packed but waiting for the check, etc. seemed to take longer than it should. The ambiance wasn't much. I hate to say it, I wouldn't come back.... but it could have been much much worse."}
{"text":"this is the only food that has ever actually altered my existence. I am a shell of a woman I once was. I came here 3 years ago and there's is not a day that goes by that I don't think about those lightly fried green beans"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the Tryst Benedict and my co-workers had the oatmeal. Our server, Brianna, kept our coffee glasses full at all times and was overall fantastic! I'll definite come back when I come back to visit."}
{"text":"Just came here with my son & daughter for breakfast before school. Everything was going smoothly until we got our food. We had 2 or 3 bites, when my daughter (whom is 4) had to use the bathroom. My son is 2, so of course i couldn't leave him at the table alone. We all stood up and walked over to our server and asked her where the restroom was (which would obviously indicate we weren't leaving, as would the fact that our plates were full, and my purse and a large backpack were still at the table). We came back 3 minutes later to find a completely cleared table. I asked our server where our food went and she simply said \"they cleared it\". No apology, instead an attitude. Obviously I was irritated because I didn't have time to sit and wait 15-20 mins for new food to come out and then let my kids eat...and so my kids were still hungry. I had to take my daughter to school. They insisted on giving us a to go box of mushy cantaloupe and honey dew. The thought was nice, but really, my kids wouldn't even touch it because of the sad condition it was in. 

All in all, here's the thing that really got to me... no one even gave a SIMPLE apology. Doesn't matter what you assumed, you made a mistake, so simply say \"I'm sorry, what can we do to make it right?\" and move on. That's a pretty basic part of hospitality, that I know. The fact that their servers had an attitude towards me after I explained to them that I was not willing to pay for three meals of which we had 2 bites from each... says a lot. I won't be coming back here; which is a shame, because the last time I came here back in November, I enjoyed the food and coffee. But to be honest, I can find endless restaurants with healthy, amazing food WITH respectful service all over Phoenix and Scottsdale. 

Edit: I just looked at your other reviews and I see that we are definitely not the only ones experiencing negative attitudes at this establishment. Hopefully you guys retrain your staff in hospitality for the sake of keeping customers coming back. A little kindness goes a really long way."}

{"text":"The breakfast was fantastic and the service was great as well. The waitress Brianna was very welcoming and was constantly attending to us. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Been here several times for lunch and dinner and it is always great.  On our last visit, my husband ordered a hot sandwich that was not hot when it was brought to him. The owner took it away and brought out a new (and very hot) replacement and then did not charge for his lunch.  The true test of customer service is how people react when something goes wrong.  This is why we will continue to come here.  Thank you Tryst!"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch today at Tryst Cafe.  I had the Tryst Omlette and my wife had the Salmon Salad.  Both were outstanding.  Coffee and Service were excellent as well.  What made the meal was the Humus (3 different flavors) with cucumbers to use as a scoop along with pita bread."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre and should not have 4 stars. The food just wasn't that good. Just pretty average."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time.  I had been wanting to try this place since I saw it freatured on local television program some time back. Once we got seated, the server assigned to our table was so rude that we never made it to the order.  I was hopeful for a nice, pleasant visit. It was disappointing, stressful and frustrating instead."}
{"text":"Great Food, TERRIBLE everything else. To start ill say I've been in the food industry for 7 years so I'm usually very patient with servers, not today. Sit down and wait 10mins for server or anyone to approach us. Ordered drinks, bloody Mary's took over 15mins. The entire time we waited the bartender leaned against the bar talking to the busser and host with zero guest at her bar(not sure if this was because the drinks werent put in on time or because she wasnt paying attention)... Finally we get drinks, and we immediately want to order  food because we knew it would take awhile, as we wait we order another round, waited 15 more minutes. The bartender finally made them and we watched them sit for 5 mins, she had no guests or anything to do just letting our drinks sit there until our server got them. Food also took a long time, about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a problem if we weren't focused on the service. The staff was very friendly and food was good but service was definitely lacking. 32.00 for 2 drinks and breakfast is also a little pricey especially when you get bad service. If you want great breakfast, good service, and decent breakfast cocktails, skip tryst cafe and go to the US Egg. I still tipped accordingly because I too live off tips but I would have tipped double at least if the circumstances were different."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in Tryst Cafe. I went to check out what had taken the place of the former sushi restaurant Celcius which I frequented. 

I ordered the portabello burger and my husband ordered the bacon burger. Our drinks were swapped when they were delivered as were our meals (I noticed this also happening to other patrons). The portabello cap was about 1/4 the size of the bread so my sandwich was all bread, except for the nearly whole Roma tomato that had been placed in my sandwich. The flavor was so-so. My husband said his burger was flavorful enough, but the brioche bread was all wrong and was soggy and falling apart from the burger sauce and juices. The fries were good as were the sweet potato tots. 

My husband had troubles getting refills on his soda and we went without seeing our waitress for what seemed a long time. I almost hoped another waitress would step in and ask how we were doing, but then I heard the other waitress hacking up a lung with a very bad cough. She should have been sent home, especially since she was coughing into her hand and then entering the kitchen area. Then one of the kitchen staff came out to the patio to take his break and was drinking a beer. I guess I'm a little conservative, but beer shouldn't be allowed on breaks. 

Our bill with tip was $27 and not worth a return visit. Tryst Cafe needs to properly train the wait staff or invest in some better help or they won't make it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Especially with it making Phoenix Magazine. I ordered the Bloody Mary. When it came out there was no celery and no stick of olives meat and cheeses like it has pictured on the menu. I ask about it and our server says oh we don't do that anymore. Well then change the menu. I ordered the Tryst breakfast. Two eggs (over easy) bacon and sweet potato tater tots. I asked for toast and for the tater tots to be well done extra crispy. No toast. No extra crispy tots. Gotta have the toast to sop up the egg juice right? Bummer. I also ordered the cinnamon rock I mean roll. Don't waste $6 on it.  

I did see some interesting things on the lunch menu so I'll probably try it again.
If it's any better I'll change the review..

So...I went for lunch with a friend. I had the grilled cheese. It was perfect. It was with avocado and tomoatoa dn perfectly grilled. It wasn't on a brioche like the menu said but it was still delish."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast and had the veggie omelette. After just one bite, I could tell I was having a high quality great tasting omelette. It had the perfect amount of fluffiness. So in sum, the omelette was definitely 5 starts.

I stopped by another time and tried the turkey wrap. It was decent, but didn't have that wow factor. I would give it 3 stars. 

Averaging the results, I give it 4 stars. 

The servers were friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and have been here 6 or do times but food is very inconsistent and certain thing are expensive. Wish there were more options in the desert ridge area-"}
{"text":"I met a friend at Tryst Cafe for lunch, the first time either one of us had been there.   We were waited on fairly quickly.  She ordered a beef burger and fries which she said were great.  I ordered the Chipotle Veggie Burger.  Huge disappointment.  The brioche bun was very greasy on the top.  The burger did not hold together and kind of fell apart.  The flavor was boring.  Sent it back and got the Roasted Beet Salad.  The presentation of this salad was odd, big stack of spinach and arugula, beets in a pile and the feta cheese on top.  Plate size did not allow me to toss it.  Very difficult to eat, but the flavor, with dressing, was decent.  I had to ask to have my iced tea refilled, friends water never was refilled.  Probably will not bother going back, just not that impressed."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there for the first time today.  It was so yummy! The service was awesome,  the food was awesome,  the ambience was awesome.  Can you even ask for more??"}
{"text":"We have frequented Tryst for 3 years now- Never have we left and been completely satisfied with the service. Food? yes. Service? no way. 
We have been asked to clear the table before my daughter finished her meal. When i said we were almost done the man commented we had been there long enough. I have repeatedly asked for a refill on coffee and never received. 
Once the young man sat us after we waiting 20 minutes only to come tell us that it wasn't our table and that we should have known because there was no high chair. Every time we leave we say we are never going back. We took my Mother in law for Mother's day and my 6 year old ordered herself the kids french toast. The served her the $15 mother's day strawberry french toast special. I mean, come on. And the girl had the audacity to argue that it's what she ordered. My daughter doesn't eat strawberries and i was there when she placed her order. She removed it but still charged us the $15.  We have never gotten smiles and chatter from whoever is tending to our table, maybe i'm asking too much?
It's a shame the customer service is so dang bad, because it's close to home and good food!"}
{"text":"Prefer Tryst for breakfast over anything else. My go-to is the Tryst or Cheese omelet.  My only complaint is that for some reason, though the eggs and ingredients are fine, there always seems to be an excess of moisture/water on my plate. I find it odd and it waters down (obviously) the food. That said, I still like the food itself. And I LOVE the tots. Love. 
It's a little pricey in my opinion, but not enough to keep me from going. 
I'd have given 4 stars if it weren't for the watery plates. I've had this issue multiple times, so it wasn't just a fluke."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today and the service was excellent and so was the food. Organic food has so much flavor! Had eggs with turkey sausage and brioche and the green jasmine iced tea -- wonderful! Wait staff is attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Cute little place , I had made reservations and was seated promptly the hostess was nice & had a cheery attitude , I was there with my 17 month old son & a girlfriend we ordered and food came out maybe 10 min later very fast so I was nervous on if food would be fresh & it defiantly was & good. I ordered the veggie omelette & sweet potato tots the tots were so yummy I will be back for sure. My friend ordered pancakes & they were huge !!! Bacon is a side item though :("}
{"text":"Delightful little cafe with fantastic fruit smoothies. I had a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and avocado. The string french fries were different and very nice. It's good to see little cafes that pay attention to quality and flavor instead of just blindly producing the standard fair. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Going downhill.  Quality/consistency of food has dropped significantly.  Items like Goat Cheese salad and the tuna sandwich have definitely fallen off.  In addition, seems like they have had quite a bit of staff turnover."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant. I took a couple of friends to try this place out. It's a nice area and atmosphere within the place. The service, however, took too long than what it should of been. I ordered the pecan crusted French toast and the cucumber drink both were very delicious. My friends were also very satisfied with the food but not with the service. I wouldn't mind giving this restaurant a second chance to redeem themselves on the service. Everything else was great and I hope they can make it stay that way."}
{"text":"Love the places where the menu is all good!   My go to is the Hawaiian Breakfast which is a bowl of rice, shredded pork and cabbage with a light drizzle of sauce.  Enjoyed the original Bloody Mary which had a nice peppery taste to it!   Nice spot to meet a friend!"}
{"text":"Consistently our go to breakfast spot in sprawling Phoenix.We thought it was worth the 20mi drive this past weekend while visiting.Next trip we will try dinner.Great creative menu leaning toward healthy options.Being healthy here does not mean sacrificing taste.
Great option among commonplace franchises and boring eateries."}
{"text":"Actually kind of disappointed with breakfast here on Mother's Day.  Went there with the family (2 adults, 2 kids) expecting a nice breakfast together.  The coffee was quite weak, and as it was served in a glass mug, kind of looked like tea.  

Kids had chocolate pancakes.   The portion was very healthy, even overly so, but there was nothing special about the flavor.

The eggs Benedict...true disappointment.  Eggs Benny is all about the Hollandaise, and this homemade version was of the caliber that you might find in a high school culinary class.  Lacked seasoning and was over-whisked.   The dish was sloppily put together -- a far cry from the visual treat that a well put together EB should present.  I wish I had snapped a photo to show you, but I actually didn't because it just wasn't visually appealing.  

Mimi's Cafe across Tatum provides a better and more consistent breakfast product that Tryst.  

We wanted to like it because of its interior charm and hipster vibe, but alas, the main event (the food) left much to be desired."}
{"text":"With the help of a localdines certificate, my husband and I went to breakfast there early Sunday morning.  We enjoyed our choices very much!  I had the \"superfood\" omelet:  egg whites stuffed w/ kale, spinach, tomato, avocado and goat cheese and sprinkled with flaxseeds.  Waitress recommended the sweet potato tots since I'm allergic to things out of a cow and one of the sides was cottage cheese.  My husband had the ham and egg breakfast w/ sweet potato hash.  Only thing that my husband wasn't really happy about is that he asked if the ham steak was really a steak or thin slices-she confirmed they were thick and they were on the very thin side.  Coffee was excellent."}
{"text":"I went to Tryst Cafe as part of a Gluten Free Foodie Tour (#GFFoodieTour) and am now a huge fan! We all split several gluten free breakfast items so I got a chance to taste the waffles, Hawaiian bowl, pancake, scrambled salmon hash and bagels. If you eat gluten free you know the texture can often be a challenge for restaurants, but everything I tried was fab - especially the bagel (Which is Udi's) and the waffles!

I don't get up to this part of town often, but I will go out of my way to go to Tryst Cafe again!"}
{"text":"Lovely place that I stumbled onto.  Friendly staff, delicious food, plenty of wine choices by the glass, and 3 guys on guitar on a Monday night. What a great surprise!!"}
{"text":"The manager responded to my issue and that is what great businesses do. I am putting my review back to 5 stars as I do love this place."}
{"text":"Love love love Tryst.  I've been there about 6 or 7 times now and I'm never disappointed.  The food is good - always.  And it's consistent.  The service is nothing special, but it's always efficient (which is what I need at lunchtime).  They are now open for dinner as well.  I recommend the sweet potato tater tots - great to share as a side dish!  Also, the Kahlua pork sandwich is spectacular.  I'm sure it's on the more fattening side for lunch - but worth the calories and just hit the gym that night.  Their salads are also top-notch!  They have a nice outdoor space, so you can also get some fresh air at lunchtime."}
{"text":"OMG! The sweet potato tots are to die for! I will be back for them! The Cajun Ahi Tuna Salad was also wonderful.  But, like other comments I've read.... The service was less than adequate.  All she did was take the order and disappear.  When she dropped the check it took her at least 10 minutes before picking it up. And, yes the card was sticking out of the presenter."}
{"text":"I have no idea if the food is good at this place as I never had a chance to try it. 
Came after calling ahead and putting our name in the list and being told the wait was 15 mins. When we showed up there was no list of course. After waiting 15 mins the hostess pointed at us to be seated and walked us to the table. Sat us and left. 2 mins later she came back asked us the name of put party and then proceeded to say she didn't mean to sit us but someone else. This person actually asked us to get up and give the table to the other party. Are you serious???? I understand one can make a mistake but you don't treat costumers like that!
Thankfully we hadn't ordered our food yet, she may have taken the forks out of our mouth!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised of low ratings here. I've tried few of their breakfast entrees including really good blueberry pancakes. All their salad is tasty and fresh too. Portion size is average. Try their fried green beans appetizer, it's best I've had. Service staff is friendly but sometimes can be slow during peak hours. However I frequent here because of their healthy options."}
{"text":"Order the grilled cheese. That's it that is all you have to do, because it's amazing.

Oh yea, and make sure to try the gluten-free desserts and give yourself a taste test challenge, if you can really tell they are gluten-free."}
{"text":"What an unassuming place for a good meal. They have a lot of Gluten Free menu items and is very kid friendly. I had the Tilapia Crisps and the Ahi Tuna Salad. Both were delicious and flavorful. I like the unique creations in terms of items that they put together for this appetizer and dish. I have to say that I was surprisingly still hungry. The prices seemed reasonable and our waitress was really nice. I truly enjoyed the outdoor patio, and can only imagine it being an even hotter day and coming back to drink."}
{"text":"Great omelette options with variations that allowed expansion on what was offered. Sweet potato hashbrowns were a new experience. Price was very reasonable and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tryst Benedict. Think salami type ham, giant caprese salad-style tomato, basil, egg on an English muffin. Plus Anaheim chile gravy like sauce. Presentation was okay, a little expensive for what it is $14+. Taste was average. Nothing special. The sweet potato tots that came with it were good. 

Here's the downside, a glass of fresh squeezed OJ is $5. That seems a bit high regardless of location. 

Close to my house, so I may try again sometime soon. 

They have Kombucha on tap and also press coffee cold brew on tap. So that's cool!"}
{"text":"We love eating at Tyrst. Food is fresh and staff is friendly and prices are great!  They also do carry out .  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot for brunch, the male companion loves their sweet potato tots, which they serve until 2PM. I usually stick to getting chorizo & eggs (ask for them to make it a scramble with cheddar), but have also had their oatmeal (HUGE FREAKIN PORTION) and most recently tried the biscuits and gravy (a little sweet, could have used more MEAT!). I'm a fan of their mimosas. 

They also have a ton of fresh smoothies, salads, and healthy options. There is also a wine flight that is catching my eye every time. I am interested in coming back for their lunch menu too, some of the sandwiches sounds great! They also apparently have live music throughout the week, which is pretty cool! Will have to check it out some time. 

Overall, I think it's decently priced, always have great service, and the food is pretty good. I just wish they had hash browns."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I got french toast and my husband got the monte cristo. We were both pleased and the coffee was pretty good for restaurant coffee. Service was really lacking though.  We were quoted 10 minute wait but it was nearly an hour before we were sat. And the waitress didn't seem interested in being there. Overall id go a again.  Food was awesome"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered as a group was absolutely incredible.  Lately my visits to restaurants through Groupons has been a hit or miss.  This was a complete home run and more.  We started off with their fried green beans and sweet potato tots.  The green beans were crystalized and not overpowering and the tots were to die for.

The winner of the night was the salmon with sweet potato hash.  I am not usually a big fan of hash or mash potato type items, but the complement of this item with the entire dish was amazing.  The salmon was so tender and perfectly cooked.  On the bottom of the plate, you had artichoke heart type of sauce that really kicked in a whole new flavor.

The final finish was the pudding.  The pudding was excellent but it may be a little sweeter for some people's liking.  I enjoyed it because I have a major sweet tooth.

I have no been \"wowed\" in a long time with food experience.  This completely blew me away."}
{"text":"great menu full of healthy options - and some not so healthy ones - so a little bit for everyone!  the burgers are enormous and they do charge for split plates - so we simply ordered one meal and a small side and used the side plate to split the burger once it came out.  i hate plate splitting fees, but I get it.  the sweet potato tots were tasty too - a little less crunchy than I like, but we still ate them all.

service was decent.  felt like we had to flag her down a few times to get water refills, but nothing I'd complain about."}
{"text":"Pork Adobo Tacos were awesome! Quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had...we will definitely be returning to Tryst Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free options: pancakes, French toast, bagels & organic eggs!!  Best breakfast in the valley especially if you're gluten free!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for breakfast with my hubby and older daughter. 

Here is what we had

French toast Bananas Foster Style - Very good but not $12 good. 

Tryst Breakfast - 2 egg, 2 bacon, sweet potato tots and toast, The bacon was good. $9

Monti Cristo- My husband thought it was alright but it being one of my favorite foods...it failed in my eyes.  $11 or $12 I can't remember

2 -coffee - yum
2- O.J. - I hated the O.J.! They say it is fresh squeezed and it kinda does seem that way but it has a taste and consistency of orange drink. It's weird. Like half O.J. half Orange drink. Those are $5 a pop...and I do not suggest.

I LOVE that it is Organic, hormone free and focused on buying local! Because of this I was absolutely ok with spending $50 on breakfast for 3 people. I just do not think the food is spectacular like Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to Tryst Cafe for the \"healthy\" menu. Waited for at least 5 minutes before any of the 3 employees working/walking past even acknowledged us. A gal from the bar finally called that she'd be with us in a minute. No employee was welcoming or even friendly. When we were finally seated the  two empty tables beside us were seated and brought their beverages before our server even stopped by to get our drink orders. We ordered the Desert Ridge Spring Rolls and the Affaire Salad, which took another 20 minutes. I have never ordered spring rolls that were served rubbery as though they were made yesterday and sat in the fridge for 24 hours, not to mention that they were 98% cabbage. I gave this review one of the stars for the sweet chili dipping sauce which was excellent. As for the Affaire Salad, Tryst earned the other star for presentation, but that was the only positive about this salad. It was bland and the ingredients did not go together well at all. Super disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here and LAST time. 

There are too many other nice places In town to go to, do not waste your time and money here.

Went there on a Wednesday morning and it was not busy and waited to be seated. I also noticed that that was the norm for all customers. 

Ordered and shared a few things that were recommended by the waiter - breakfast burrito and Hawaiian Breakfast which were both average to poor. If that is what is recommended then the other dishes must be pig slop. 

The over the top was when my daughter ordered orange juice and then had a refill and that came to $5 and $2.50 so I asked the waiter why there was a price difference an was explained that each juice hasa $2 surcharge and that the first glass of oj was $5 and he thought he would give me a break and charge a refill for $2.50. Wow sounds like somebody feels guilty of the price.

The waiter said he would include a comment card which would go straight to the owner, so I thought Yelp would be a better way to wake up this cafe.

Lastly, I thought all the items were way over priced from entree to beverages. 

I love trying new places but the key is to have your customers come back which I will not be back here until things change with prices and service.

If I could give this place a zero star, that is more reflective"}
{"text":"I had lunch with two girlfriends today before catching an afternoon movie.  I was completely taken aback by the prices and just couldn't get past this.  I mean seriously - $12 for a kale salad wrap?  Add chicken and you are at $16!!!???  For a wrap and a lttle side of fruit?  It tasted fine, though a little dry, but nothing close to special or memorable.  I can't justify it  and don't anticipate a return visit in my future.  Sorry, but there are other fresh and healthy options in the area with realistic pricing."}
