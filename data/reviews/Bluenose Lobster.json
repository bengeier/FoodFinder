{"text":"I honestly wanted to like this place. I even went in with low expectations.   $17 for a lobster roll. There was a really good amount of lobster, but here are my qualms: not very fresh, smushy, and sooooo incredibly oily that your bread is soggy AF, so much so you can't even pick it up to eat. It just disintegrates.   Lobster bisque small $11 a lot of lobster chunks. Again smushy. Base was too thick. The only thing I liked about this was there were a lot of veggies."}
{"text":"3 stars for several reasons- despite the generous serving of lobster in the roll, you pay 17$ for ONLY a roll and a pickle. While the roll tasted excelled - buttery, warm & lemoney..you only get a side of pickle with it. No fries, chips etc. I love the taste of it but absolutely can not justify paying 17$ for a sandwich that doesn't fill a small girl like me up.   Service was also meh. The employee did not smile once and simply took the order and served us.   All in all, I don't think I'll be back here. I love buttered lobster rolls but can't justify the price."}
{"text":"Got the large lobster bisque ($15).  Now, I'm not really sure of what a really good lobster bisque should be, and my intention was to come here to find out what a good lobster bisque should be.  (I think I was hoping for a \"soup Nazi\" moment where Elaine had to sit down because the soup was so good)  The soup had a little bit of a spice to it, and it had decent flavors. It had a good amount of lobster meat chunks in the soup, but the bowl was a bit small, and the soup wasn't filled to the top. I know lobster is expensive, but I felt at least they can at least fill it up with soup to the top. I felt slightly gypped. The lobster meat was pretty good.  The soup came with a buttered roll on the side that was actually quite good. The service was also good.  Decent soup to try but I wouldn't come back for it again. The hunt for what amazing lobster bisque should be continues...  Quality: 7/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 5.5/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"Lobster rolls were very yummy but for $17 you only get 3 bites. No joke. No sides or drink included in the price. Red Lobster is amazing and for that price you can get a main course."}
{"text":"This is probably not my favorite lobster place. The lobster roll is tiny. Like smaller than six inches. The bread was very thin and dissolved apart like a hot dog bun. I couldn't enjoy my sandwich as it collapsed in my hands. The quality of the meat was okay but it was also very oily. Paying close to 19$, I did not feel satisfied at all. The pictures are too deceptive!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend. The decor is quite nice and the lobster looked fresh. I ordered the combo with bisque and bluenoser roll (cold lobster roll). At $22 it's definitely not a cheap lunch. I have to say there was a very generous amount of lobster however the worker that was working there just put an insane amount of lemon juice into the bisque which completely overwhelmed the whole soup. I ended up just scooping the lobster out of the bowl and threw out the soup which was very disappointing. The roll itself was great!"}
{"text":"One of the many vendors inside the Assembly Chef's Hall. We opted for the cold lobster roll. On the plus side there was a generous portion of lobster which included pieces of tail and claw. Thankfully the lobster was lightly dressed and not drenched in mayo. Bun was nicely toasted. Now the downside. Personally I found the lobster slightly overdone. Several pieces were tough and chewy.   Three stars for the amount of lobster used for the price.  Two stars because the lobster was overdone.   Essentially 2 1/2 stars overall."}
{"text":"Lobster not all that fresh, rolls really tiny, no sides (although a side listed on the board). Many other options--skip that place."}
{"text":"Was waiting for our reservation at Tachi so we decided to snack on some oysters.  Got a half dozen oysters for $10 that came with mignonette, hot sauce and freshly grated horse radish. The oysters were briny and fresh but very small. The star was the freshly grated horse radish that gave the oysters a nice flavour and texture."}
{"text":"I came to the Bluenose stall at the Assembly Hall to have some lobster, after drooling for days on end at all the instagram streams of images of their food. I just wish their rolls were BIGGER! Completely contained in my two hands with large hunks of lobster meat jutting out and the buttery fragrance pervading my entire personal space...IT JUST VANISHED. One second in my hand, the next in my stomach! Honestly, though, expensive for the price to portion ratio. It was every bit as delicious as I had imagined; I just want more.  My friend had the lobster soup, it wasn't as good to our likings; but I'd definitely want more of the rolls!"}
{"text":"In theory, this should be great.   For $17, the lobster roll is absolutely stuffed. However, the quality is the issue. I found the lobster, overcooked and dry. Looking at the counter, I suspect it's got to do with how slow the business was that day. The roll itself is also not right.    So on one hand, you're getting a very decent amount of lobster, on the other hand, it'll be as great as the batch (i/e how long ago the lobster was deshelled and whether it was cooked right). If you land freshly cracked meat cooked right, this place will be an absolute steal."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience with Bluenose. There's so much lobster that the $17 price tag totally makes sense. Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand the negative reviews for this place. I liked the lobster rolls, they had lots of meat and a nice citrusy aftertaste. The buns are crunchy on the out and soft on the inside. Bisque is good too. 4 stars."}
