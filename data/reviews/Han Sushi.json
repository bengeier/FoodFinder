{"text":"Had a fantastic experience at Han Sushi tonight! I thought they closed at 10pm and arrived at 915. Turns out they close at 930pm on Tuesdays but they sat us anyways! The food was unbelievable as always (my bf and I go here weekly). Service always with a smile. The chef used to work at Wabora and prepares unique and beautifully presented rolls without the expensive price tag. We HIGHLY recommend Han Sushi to anyone who loves sushi or Asian type dishes."}
{"text":"After a fun day of shopping, my friend and I couldn't decide what to eat so we went to the highest rated resto in the area, Mikado.  It was closed (permanently)!  :(

We drove by a restaurant called Han Sushi so we figured we'd give that place a try.  

I admit, I was a bit hesitant because when we peered in the window, there were no diners, only staff.  We also noticed there was a sign for a different sushi joint on the mailbox.  Things that make you go hmmm...  Anyways, let the adventure begin!  

Our server was Gabe.  He was a friendly guy.  He gave us just the right amount of attention by checking in, filling water, etc.  The other female server was also very polite and efficient.

We tried the following:
-Edamame (complimentary)
-Sashimi sampler-tuna, white tuna, yellowtail
-Yellowtail  ...something I can't remember from the appetizers 
-Rainbow roll
-Tempura combination plate
-Sundae roll (complimentary sampling of four pieces)
-fruit (complimentary)

The sashimi was cut in generous slices.  The rolls were pretty large.  The tempura were crispy and freshly fried.  All the plates were nicely presented.

I told Gabe that the Sundae roll reminded me of the rolls at Wabora.  Turns out the chef used to work at Wabora and helped to develop the menu! 

Han Sushi needs to advertise their new presence in the area.  I think this place has a lot of potential.  Once word gets out that they have a great selection of creative rolls, the people will come.  The service is on point to serve the Leaside community.  

P.S.  They do take-out."}
{"text":"Glad to see there's another decently price and delicious sushi joint in the area. Here's what I ordered from Han's:

House Beef Spring Rolls -- $4.95

Hurricane Roll --  $13.95

Triple Shrimp Roll -- $11.95

Gotta say I was overall happy with the order. The sushi rolls were the more big ticket items on the menu (you can more traditional rolls on the menu for under $10), but I had to try these out (going by the pics on yelp)- I was not disappointed. 

The spring rolls were the least exciting, taste wise, but I needed a $25 minimum order and they did the trick. I think $5 is a bit steep though for one long spring roll cut in half.

Delivery was quick and easy so, will keep Han's on my sushi short list. 

I RECOMMEND- the triple shrimp. The Han crunch roll looks good too, for next time.
