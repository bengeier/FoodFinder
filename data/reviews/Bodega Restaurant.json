{"text":"Good french restaurant. Portions are not big, but not too petite.
The patio is amazing.
The service was great! Don't know the name of our waiter (blond girl,) but she was attentive, patient and nice."}
{"text":"I went to Bodega today for the first time. We were supposed to be eating Brunch, but the person who accepted the booking didn't inform the lady who made the booking that there would be no brunch because of Winterlicious, despite being asked to confirm that a brunch menu would be available.

Luckily, their Winterlicious menu looked good. I ordered the Beet Salad, the Grilled Salmon & the Banana Cake.

The Beet salad was very good & the seasoning was perfect.

The Grilled salmon was nice, but there was very little sauce and a lot of lentils, which made it an average dish. (I tried the beef that my partner had ordered and it was pretty good.)

The Banana cake with Toffee sauce was ok. It was too sweet and rich for my liking.

The portions were good & overall the food was a 3.5 stars.

The reason I am giving it 2 stars is that the service wasn't great. It took the staff about 20 minutes to take our order. We were the first people in the restaurant and were a large group. At the time we were seated there was nobody else in there.

I had to leave early for a play and so went to our server and asked her to give me a bill for my portion. She told me it wasn't easy to get my bill because it was a group and that's how the software worked and that it would take her a couple of minutes to print it out. Nearly 10 minutes later, I was still standing there, waiting for her to get my bill while she passed by me several times and went to other tables.

I realise that the place was busy, but 10 minutes to get the bill for someone who has told them that they have to catch a play, is just ridiculous. There was also no apology and finally someone from our group volunteered to pay my bill and asked me to pay her back later. 

I will definitely avoid Bodega. While the food is not bad, the service clearly needs improvement."}
{"text":"Bodega is a great classy restaurant to take your significant other to, for a romantic date ;) Sadly, I didn't have a date and went with a couple of my girlfriends instead. BUT this sad story does have a happy ending as I tried this restaurant for the Summerlicious Event and it turned out to be an amazing dining experience for me. The food was cooked to absolute perfection to my liking. 
For my complete trio lunch dining, I went with the Baked Goat Cheese Tart Nicoise, Duck Confit with Frites and a White Chocolate Mousse Cake. So here goes my narration.... The goat cheese tart was very unique in its texture as the tart was crispy/flakey and the cheese was very creamy. Definitely not what I expected but they tasted very good together. The duck confit was  juicy, flavorful and very tender - literally fall off the bone meat! It was all yums! Lastly with my desert, the chocolate mousse cake was excellent as it had the right amount of sweetness. It went well with the distinctive fruit flavoured coulis that were drizziled onto the cake (I think it was mango, raspberry... and I forgot the last one). But all and all, a great lunch experience as I was lucky to have a very attentive server. I left extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"JENN SAYS - 
MARCOS SAYS - Two and a half stars. Right on the fence. Big hits and big misses.

MARCOS' REVIEW: Jenn took me here for Father's Day 2013. Food was OK, but a lot of work is needed to make it a more even experience.

Grilled Calamari Salad - $10 - was too peppery!  And I like pepper, but this was too much
Salmon Gravlax Cured in House - $11 - Good gravlax, but the potato pancake is horrible ! The portion of fish is too small
Lamb Patties with scrambled eggs - Don't remember the price, I think $14 - Sides are good, 2 scrambled eggs are nothing to write home about, lamb patties are good and tasty and juicy but too small...
Quiche du Jour - $13 - Guys, this came from the freezer, didn't it?? It is edible. Nice side salad.
Grilled Calf's Liver - $14 - The liver is OK, the side vegetables were very good.

Mojito for $11 - Damn good mojito, but way too small. Still, when it is this good I don't feel dupped
Other cocktail for $10 - terrible value, it was just fruit juice and rum, it also came in way too small glass

Service was the biggest miss. Serving staff is amateur at best. Lazy, never refilled the water, forgot about us in a semi-empty restaurant. Never came back with our requests (extra fork, extra plate). We were in the patio, I had to go inside to find the waitress and ask for the bill. Come to Bodega when you have time to burn, because it just may take forever to eat here.

Too many other great places in this same street, competition is brutal, I'm not sure if Bodega can keep this pace forever.   

JENN'S REVIEW:"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place, the food is amazing, and you can't go wrong with $29.95 for a 3-course prix-fixe meal! and for $16 more you get a wine flight with each course. It's the best prix-fixe deal I've had in Toronto so far! the warm banana cake is a must-try, I'm salivating just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went the first time for winterlicious, and although we had to wait quite a while for our table to be ready (even with a reservation), the food and service was so good that we forgave all. He still remembers the duck confit with garbanzo beans and craves it on a regular basis, I remember my creme brulee -- yum.
It also has a nice clean, romantic atmosphere, great for a date. The wine list is good, and their brunch (steak and eggs) is to die for. I could go here again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"One of the few great restaurants in the downtown core that's opened on Sundays. Tucked away in a tiny strip of restaurants on Baldwin, Bodega is definitely a pleasant surprise. 

We loved the cozy and quiet ambiance and it's a great date spot - it was relatively quiet on a rainy and Sunday night, and we're able to enjoy each other's company. The food was good at a very reasonable price, and the strawberry rhubarb tart was terrific. On top of that, service was top-notch - our waitresses were attentive and friendly, but also gave us some privacy at the right time. Definitely will recommend!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I came here first time for Summerlicious 2013 with two others.

Wow, the apps were good and the mains were amazing. The sweet and bitter salad was really great; a great mix of the two flavours. The rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and the duck confit was good as well. Flavours were not too subtle, but not too rich either; just right. Everyone was really happy with their apps and mains.

I will say that if I had to pay regular price, I wouldn't be so impressed with their desserts or drinks. I ordered a mimosa ($8) and someone ordered soft mojito ($11). They were both not very good, and the portion was really small (mimosa came in a very skinny glass, and was portioned for like, 4 small gulps), so a double whammy on both drinks. 

The desserts were also very simple; not like \"awesome because it was so simple and amazing\", but like, \"just simple and meh\". Like I said, I think this place has good appetizer and great mains, but not so much for dessert and specialty drinks.

We sat on the patio, and it was really cute; birds singing, music playing, leaves and twigs falling on to our table, which made us giggle. The bee was pretty scary, but I seriously recommend the patio.

Server was very busy, so we understood that he wasn't always there. He apologized on his own and he was very courteous. Left a great tip, because I think service at regular times would be fantastic."}
{"text":"We came here as part of Winterlicious, and it was one of the best meals i've had in Toronto. 

First, the atmosphere was absolutely wonderful, we sat very close to the live fire place, in a cozy, warm and french environment. The soup of the day was wonderful especially with the great nutty fresh bread that Bodega served it with. For my main I had the duck confit with white beans and sausage that was delightful (i'm not even a fan of sausage). My date had the Beef Bourguignon that stuffed him well but was also delicious. Bodega did a great job of pairing our meals with nice wines as well. The dessert was probably the weakest link, in the form of a fairly standard chocolate mousse but it was good. 

Overall between the atmosphere, the friendly service and the great food it was a great Winterlicious experience and a place I'm surely to frequent a lot."}
{"text":"It was very average to not that great. My friend ordered from the prix fixe menu and didn't like any of the courses. He couldn't even finish the steak because it was so tough. I ordered from the regular menu and got the French onion soup and lamb shank. The cheese on the soup was burnt and ruined the taste of the soup. At least the shank was ok. Definitely have had better. 

The worst part is that when we were done we had to wait a looong time just to pay.  The waiter decided that he would help the group next  to us first.  BUT it was like 8 people all with individual checks and everyone paying with a credit card. So it took like 20 minutes for him to finish. Ridiculous. 

I guess it would be ok if you want to pay a lot for average food and slow service."}
{"text":"Came here -first time - for dinner to try the summerlicious 2017 menu. The restaurant has a nice patio and is located in an interesting area of town. Inside it is a bit dark and the room is split into two. We were on the left side next to the bar. Food was excellent and nicely presented:
-warm calamari w/ sundried tomatoes and olives-cooked perfectly that one of my guests was wondering what they did to have the calamari that soft
-wellington county beef, yukon gold frites, shallot butter-I had my meat cooked rare as I wanted  (not medium rare or medium when I asked for rare!) but it was not as tender I thought it would be. Still it tasted great. I did not notice the shallot butter. Mine had onion compote/caramelised onion? instead
-raspberry creme brulee-which was ok and I was very distracted by my guest's chocolate & espresso brownie!

My guests ordered the bouillabaisse and grilled chicken supreme which they commented were excellent.

Service was fast, the free bread really good,warm and fluffy and the meal was complemented by a nice glass of Malbec. Overall nice food and I look forward to coming back even to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner today with my boyfriend after reading all the great reviews. I don't think I'll be going there again. The server was cold and impolite. After pouring my drink, I said thank you and he didn't even bother replying or smiling back or came by to ask how the food was. The food itself wasn't great either. Had the french onion soup. The cheese on top was too hard and soup too salty. Crab cake tastes really fishy and the interior is soggy. The steak in the steak frites was great though. Very tender and juicy, but the frites look and taste like those store bought frozen fries. We also had the vegetarian tower. It was okay, nothing special, we felt it's too greasy and lack in taste. I had creme brubee for dessert, it wasn't too sweet, so it paired with the sugar top perfectly, a good finishing touch to the dinner."}
{"text":"Food was decent and atmosphere was great. However, the only thing that this place lacks is their service. 

My friend recently brought in a birthday cake with macarons on top; however, some ended up missing somewhere, presumably someone who works in the kitchen's stomach. They tried using the excuse that it might've been chopped up and scattered on the cake. The thing is though, nobody at the table had even one bit of the \"chopped up\" macarons.

Macaron thief much?"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Bodega but honestly, I had the worst entree there last week. It was supposed to be Risotto, and I feel responsible 1. for ordering it - what was I thinking?  2. for not sending it back - we were with guests; we were in a hurry; I second guessed myself - 'maybe it's just me' . 
The risotto was white  rice combined with halved plum tomatoes and sundried tomatoes sitting on top of a runny, pungent olive brine sauce.   I've never seen a risotto like this. For starters it wasn't an arborio-style rice, and as far as I could tell it hadn't been cooked in the stock.  It was as if the cook had no idea what risotto was.    No idea!  It was horrible.  Sorry Bodega. I should have sent it back and saved you the bad review . . . but how is it that you ever let it out of the kitchen?  In the past, I've had a lunch meal that was as good as this one was bad.  Two different cooks?"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. 

It's in a cool little neighbourhood with other bars/cafes/restaurants, most with patios. 

The summerlicious menu is pretty good. Had the rabbit terrine for starter which was very nice but a bit dry. For main I had the chicken supreme - chicken was very well cooked, the market vegetables were cooked well but a bit underwhelming and the sauce hadn't been reheated properly because some of it was still a bit gelatinous, but tasted good. Had the sorbet for desert which tasted good was extremely sweet. 

Service was from a fairly smarmy waiter, beer was flat, but the wine was good."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto the patio to have a nice late lunch. I ordered the seared sea scallops and the heirloom tomato salad. I did at one point ask if there was any clue as to how many calories were in the meal it was consuming at which point I was confronted and told we are under no obligation to tell you that. So I feel I am under an obligation to tell you not to eat here"}
{"text":"I went with my bf on a weekday night at 8pm, and when we got there there were only 3 tables including us... which is strange for a recommended restaurant on yelp. The ambiance and decor is typical for a French restaurant.

We ordered the scallop appetizer, steak, and duck. The scallop is really good, I would recommend ordering it. But I have to say even I can cook the steak better -- I asked for medium, and it really is medium well when it came out. The sauce was pretty good though. The duck was okay. Didn't expect the duck to be as flavorful as the Peking Duck, and turns out my expectation was right. We had the dishes with some wine, and the wine was great.

It was kind of a disappointment considering I checked many reviews of many French restaurants, probably won't recommend to friends either."}
{"text":"There food is really delicious. I come here for Winterlicious almost every year. No words to describe their food, you just really have to come and try it. A bit pricey, but this isn't a fast food shack anyways."}
{"text":"WOW! That's all I have to say about this little gem of a place! A couple friends and I went here a few days ago and had an incredible time! This place was hopping with Christmas parties all around and the service still was amazing! The servers were all so attentive, despite being busy with all the other people in the place. The food was great. So well portioned and the taste was to die for! Such a great atmosphere, friendly service and great food. I will definitely be returning here and I highly recommend you give this place a try! :)"}
{"text":"First things first: service is terrible here. My brother and mother took me here for my birthday last night and we ordered from the Winterlicious menu. 

The waiters are cold. One offered to level out our table and our orders were taken fast. However, the food took a while to arrive. I had the blue crab cakes (it was delicious), the baked chicken (ok- I can get much better chicken at Ruth's Chris and really should've gone there) and for dessert, the mango pudding and vanilla ice cream. Portion sizes were good and I must admit that I was mighty full after the meal.

Overall, I'd give the food a 4/5. HOWEVER, any tastiness in the food was overshadowed by the terrible service. My brother, mother and I finished our appetizers and main courses and we literally sat there for 10 minutes after each course with our empty dishes left in front of us. This is even though at least two waiters walked by and saw the empty dishes. 

Our water was refilled once (refilling being the mark of great service) and only because my brother asked the waiter for it. NO ONE came to ask how the food was- NOT EVEN ONCE. When it came time to pay, we were charged for 4 Winterlicious patrons when there were clearly only 3 of us and when my brother pointed this out, there was not even an apology.

I've patronized many restaurants that partake in the Winterlicious event over the years and this is the first time that I've had a bad experience and on my birthday no less. It's pretty idiotic of them as if i were a restaurant, I'd use the Winterlicious event to market to potential customers. Way to leave a bad impression on potential customers. Never returning to this place and taking my business and network of friends and colleagues elsewhere."}
{"text":"The taste of the food may have been tainted by how utterly rude our waiter was. Greeted with a \"What do you want?\" we immediately regretted coming in. Anything we asked for, beverages, cutlery, we received no response from him and sometimes the request would be fufilled. Don't bother with Bodega."}
{"text":"The best option in that Baldwin block for good food. Came today for the last day of Winterlicious, and it was delicious, really excellent value for money! 

For starters, I had Moules Marinière which were flavorful and the mussels were nicely cooked. My friend had roasted bell pepper soup which was really excellent from what I heard.

For the main I had the Cassoulet with Duck Confit, the white beans served with it was perfectly cooked to my liking, not hard and not mushy so it retained texture, it was soft but not falling apart if that makes any sense, the bacon and sausage in the beans gives the beans a nice flavor The duck confit was nicely done, it was falling off the bone tender yet not dry, it was just a bit too salty for my liking. My friend had the Grilled Atlantic Cod and the cod was nicely cooked with a great crust. The portion sizes for the duck and cod were generous yet, another friend had ravioli (not a winterlicious item) and he got maybe 6 raviolis which I heard was \"not very good\". 6 raviolis for $17 is not that great.

For dessert, I had Duo of Raspberry and Orange Sorbet, which was average, nothing to write home about, might be a bit tooo sweet and it was a bit melted when it arrived.

Overall the restaurant generally serves good food for the price range it is being judged at. The service is always pretty good, service is prompt and non-intrusive. This restaurant is 5 starts for Winterlicious because the value to quality ratio is very high, under normal circumstances, it is a 4 since some of the items I had tried before were just ok for this price range. It is definitely the best option on Baldwin if you want to have a nice meal though."}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago for the first time. I ordered the duck confit which was overall, great but a bit on the drier side. The customer service was great and the atmosphere inside is very intimate and cozy. I give it 3 stars only because I couldn't fully justify the price with the plate I had."}
{"text":"My colleague and I were here for Summerlicious 2016. I had the warm calamari salad for appetizer and I must say it was an excellent choice. The lemon-oregano dressing was a little zesty and perfectly complemented the calamari. The only drawback was that the quantity was rather measly. My main was the wild mushroom risotto. This was the highlight of my meal. The risotto was fragrant and amazingly flavorful and I couldn't get enough of the sundried tomatoes. My dessert was the lemon tart - nothing special. The restaurant looked like a house externally and inside it was kinda plain but homely. We chose a table by the window and had a lovely view out onto Baldwin Street. The wait staff were lovely and very attentive. There were only both of us because we went for lunch at 3pm, pretty much after the lunch crowed had cleared."}
{"text":"For a fine dining establishment, it didn't measure up to my expectations. French onion soup had stiff cheese, not melted enough. I enjoy rare steak but their steak was too tough. I had to leave some not-so-pretty chewed up bits on the plate. And the service was sub par; they forgot who's plate is who, plus they weren't very attentive to when we finished or bothered to ask if we were. I can see how the decor makes it good for romantic evenings, but I wouldn't make this a prospective date place since I'm disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice Sunday dinner.  We stumbled along Bodega as we made our way down Baldwin.  From the outside it looks very fancy but we were greeted warmly and the light, fun music set the tone for our delicious dinner.  The prix fix menu was well worth the $35, the food was delicious, beautifully presented and the service was impressive.
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a few work related events. It has a patio and the inside is cosy with a Bistro ambiance and natural sunlight streaming in from Baldwin St.

They have a good prix fixe menu for lunch. I recommend the duck confit which is a menu staple. My coworkers agree with me."}
{"text":"We went to Bodega for Valentines Day and it was fabulous.  We had a reservation, however they were completely swamped and behind on seating guests, but to be expected ona busy night like Valentines Day.  The staff were apologetic and offered everyone free sparkling wine until the tables were ready, a very thoughtful touch.
We had the froie gras and grilled quail for appetizers, and the lamp shank and veal chop for mains.  Everything was fantastic and thoroughly delicious.  The food was warm, presented nicely and the taste was amazing.  We had warm maple pudding and flourless chocolate cake for dessert, and the chocolate cake was incredible.  I have no idea how they made it, but it was just amazing.  The maple pudding was fantastic as well, but its hard to compete with this chocolate cake.  The wine list was quite extensive for bottles, but I would have like to have seen more options for glasses or half liters.  
All in all Bodega is a high-quality restaurant that will satisfy foodies, but still remains reasonably priced.  Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.

The seared scallop and shrimp ravioli appetizer is pretty phenomenal.  The lamb shank entree is delicious."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with a group of professionals after I selected this establishment. I had high hopes for this restaurant. Sadly I was disappointed. 

Location: At one end of Keningston Market, this place is easy to find and features outdoor setting. It's a great part of the city in my opinion with tons of eclectic buildings and people all around. So a pro just difficult to reach if you are driving!

The Interior: It's pretty however, very tight. If I stretched out my arm I could touch the bar and that wasn't very pleasant especially whenever a server passed by with drinks since they splashed all over one of my fellow diners.

The Food: Lackluster. The only good thing was the crab cake filling. The exterior was over fried and oily, the tomato provencale was tasted too make of oil, the aioli was subpar. I ordered the grilled salmon which was overcooked and the saffron rice was covered in an oily dressing which was unpleasant. Those who had the duck confit told me it was dry as was the rack of lamb. Dessert was a disaster of creme brulee custard cooked to scrambled eggs, bread pudding as hard as rock and chocolate cake that refused to slice! 

The Service: If you are a server and you really hate your job I don't know what to tell you besides don't take it out on your customers. We were ignored for 30 minutes regardless of us requesting to be serviced. We would make eye contact or beckon to our waitress who promptly made a face and turned around and walked away. I was perched by the end of the night only receiving a water refill once that night and the glass was small!  Waiting for the food was ridiculous. To get an appetizer: 30 minutes, a main: 45 minutes, dessert: 30 minutes. How the dining experience went on so long is based solely on poor service and bad food. 

I would not recommend this restaurant unless you are famished and you don't want to wait a long line up for ice cream instead. And even then I would avoid."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience! We are SO disappointed. I have no complaints about the food as it was above average but the service was the WORST I've seen.

The first impression was great: cute neighbourhood, convenient location (we walked from Kensington Market), cozy setting. 

Upon entering the restaurant, our waiter lead us to our table. A few minutes later when he came back to hand out our menus, he did not introduce himself as our waiter nor welcome us to the restaurant. He actually did not even SAY A WORD to us until our full party arrived 20 minutes later and he came to take our order. Again, no introductions nor welcoming us nor explaining the menu... he was simply taking our order. He was dressed differently than the other waiters so we wonder if he is the manager. There was another server who gave us our bread and he was friendly and smiling.

We are a party of 6 and we ordered from the Winterlicious menu on Sunday. We were told the duck confit was sold out, but it was nice that they had a streak frites substitution. Our reservation was for 1:00pm and the waiter took our order at around 1:20pm but by 2:30pm, our entrees have not arrived yet. We had to flag down our waiter and ask why our food was taking so long. He explained that there was a large group who ordered before us and the kitchen was taking care of their orders. That's bull... we watched other tables who arrived AFTER us who got their entrees BEFORE us. They even got duck confit!!! I understand the kitchen can get busy but our best guess is they forgot our order.

Once our food finally arrived, it was around 2:45pm, more than an hour after our order was taken. The steak came out too charred but the trout was flaky and yummy. Our waiter finally talked to us again and asked if everything was fine... but this was AFTER we had finished the food on our plates. After another wait for our dessert, we FINALLY finished our meal at 3:30pm. 

When the bill came, there was a mandatory charge of 20% tips (because of our party of 6). This was absolutely fine IF service was better but we were forced to pay that amount for bad service. I do not recommend Bodega to ANYONE after we were treated SO poorly."}
{"text":"I was in charge of finding a restaurant for my date night. I initially wanted Italian, however, decided that French cuisine was what I was really craving. Since we were in the area, we decided to try Bodega's after reading several great reviews of the place.

The interior of the restaurant is very charming, with two sides. We were seated to the right of the restaurant by the cozy fire. Perfect for a cold, humid night. I am the one to study the menu online so I already knew what I wanted. For starters, I would have the salad which was so good and for mains, the Duck Confit dish. My bf had the Quail Salad and the Risotto.

FYI - Bodega has a prix fix menu for $35 a person which includes appetizers, main, and dessert, however we didn't find anything to our fancy. My duck was very delicious, and it was a lot of meat: one big duck leg with 6-7 pieces of tender breast all smothered in a lovely sauce. My bf's risotto was average, and he even stole some pieces of my duck. For dessert, I had the Banana Bread pudding which hit the perfect dessert spot for the night.

I decided to live it up that night by ordering a Chateuneuf du Pape bottle which was absolutely heavenly. I thought it was a nice touch that after pouring two glasses for us, the waiter asked if we wanted the rest decantered or left in the bottle.

Service. Basic at best. Our waiter was efficient, but not warm, jovial, and not smiles. He wasn't the kind to continually pour our wine or water and asked us once if everything was okay...after that, my bf and I were pretty much left to our own. I didn't really mind it as it was nice for some peace and quiet. 

Both my bf and I mentioned the lack of pepper offer for our plates - is this because they feel that the plate is already flavoured perfectly? In any event, I like my freshly ground pepper and somehow that makes a big difference!

Total price for two including tax and tip came out to be $230 so a splurgy evening. Would I come back here? If I were in the area maybe, but certainly wouldn't come out of my way. Although the food and environment were great, I still want to try many restaurants out there."}
{"text":"We come here when my parents are in town. A very cozy place with delicious food and terrific service. The background music is just right to have good conversations. No matter how many times we come here, I always look forward to coming back.  Make sure to try the beat salad. Rack of lamb is also one of my favs."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 4 on a Friday evening around 8:30pm hoping for a quick meal after visiting someone at Mount Sinai. We chose here mainly because it looked somewhat busy and they have a nice-sized patio. I was a bit discouraged seeing the low rating on Yelp, but thought we would give it a try anyways. To begin, the waiter tried to be helpful but couldn't really answer some of our questions about the menu. After we ordered it took at least 30-45 min to get our food, and the food itself was very mediocre and very overpriced. $22 for a simple Cobb salad with sparse ingredients is ridiculous, though the chicken was well-cooked. We also ordered the calamari appetizer which was rubbery and didn't taste fresh. The best part of the meal was the side of fries, as they were crispy and decadent. There was a loud wedding inside the restaurant, and many of the guests were hanging around outside, blocking the doorway that the staff use to bring out food from the kitchen, shouting and swearing. Overall, definitely wouldn't go back. There are much better places in Baldwin Village (Kinton probably being the best, but a better choice when it's cold outside)."}
{"text":"Went to Bodega last week for brunch and thought it was average at best.  For a pricey downtown bistro, the service here is lagging behind its competitors. One person in our group had to send his food back because it was cold. That's fine, mistakes happen, but the waiter acted like he would rather be at the dentist's office than tending to our table. Hopefully he was just having a rough morning but it was off-putting all the same, especially considering what we paid for our meal. I ordered Eggs Benny which wasn't bad but also nothing to write home about. If you're looking for Eggs Benny that will truly knock your socks off, stop by Carens in Yorkville or Amore in midtown."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. The room smelled. The food was limp and burned. Never again. Stay away."}
{"text":"Tried this place during the wintericious lunch. We tried rabbit and pistachio terrine and escargo with pasta for entree, Duck confit&Cassoulet and beef bourguignon for main which were great. Creme brulee and chocolate moose for dessert as well. Certainly, it was good quality at reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very lovely restaurant. Cozy, romantic, and friendly staff. Went to Winterlicious this past winter, and everything was really delicious! Would love to go back."}
{"text":"Our experience at Bodega was so conflicting that it averages out to 3 stars. 

Bodega looks like a cozy home from the outside and it was very quiet when we entered. Our server was friendly but didn't know anything about the menu. Never have I had such clueless service; it was actually quite shocking. We asked him what main dish he would recommend and he responds with two first course dishes. Okay, maybe this was a mistake. Then we ask again, which ENTREE is popular. He rambles off saying that the paella is wonderful. Um, paella is not even on the menu. Right. Then I ask about the cioppino dish, which is described as a fish stew. He says that cioppino is a kind of tasty fish (wrong) and then when we mentioned a fish stew, he said, \"Oh yes! That one is very popular!\" although we were just talking about that same dish. Altogether we were not impressed by how unknowledgeable the server was; he actually knew nothing about the menu. 

After all of that and learning nothing new about the menu, boyfriend and I decided to go with one Prix Fixe dinner ($35), because we could order the blue crab cakes, cod and a dessert, in addition to steak tartare, terrine de foie gras and pan-roasted branzino. 

The food was really a hit and miss.
- blue crab cakes (prix fixe): absolutely delicious, full of crab meat and the herbs really highlight the crab taste
- steak tartare: not memorable, boyfriend thought the meat wasn't cut correctly 
- terrine de foie gras: it had a weird lingering alcoholic taste after each bite and we couldn't even force ourselves to finish this dish; the fat along the edges should've been removed
- cod (prix fixe) and branzino: these mains were delicious and much better than the first course dishes
- lemon tart (prix fixe): good tart lemon curd and shortbread crust

Complimentary bread was good; it was grainy and hearty. 

All in all, a disappointing experience and I still cannot get over how aloof the server was (and I never am affected by service!). He also messed up our bill by charging an extra cod dish."}

So warm & nice. I had reservations and asked for a window seat, which wasn't given, but whatever. It was pretty nice despite that. They have warm, cream coloured walls and nice wooden tables & a bar.

Service:
The service was absolute crap. Usually, I don't mind bad service. But this service was so bad that I actually noticed and was a bit annoyed. The woman who waited on us looked very pissy, and kept looking like we owed her money or something. Slightly resentful (perhaps because we were wearing jeans. Sigh.)
The food took a bit of time but it wasn't bad. Nobody asked \"how is the meal going?\" which was a bit strange. The main thing is that girl waitress who looked so bored, condescending and snobby. She kept sighing when I asked her questions about the meal items, it was service worse than Chinese restaurants (you know what I'm talking about. those with super good food, and super bad service)

Hire better waitresses! It's not that hard!
1/5 star service.

BUT. the food is the main star of the show. How was it?

Appetizer: 
My sister had the soup of the day with this amazing bread. The soup was really salty so she dipped a bit of bread in the soup, and it was soooo good. I stole a few bites from her. The bread was chewy and hearty. 

I had a Calamari salad with mango & a lemon oregano dressing. Very delicious, quite fresh too. 
5/5 stars for appetizer. 

Main Course:
Duck confit: it was huge.
And not bad! It was a bit more dry than I hoped for, and the lentil salad was slightly underseasoned for my tastes. But it wasn't bad, I'd give it a 3.5/5 stars.

Dessert: 
My sister had the Creme Brulee, which was small but amazing. It wasn't too sweet, which I loved. So creamy and delicious!
5/5 stars

I had the blueberry bread pudding, which I was super disappointed in :( I always love dessert the most, but this really let me down.
It wasn't what I was looking for - a spongy, creamy & fruity dessert. The Creme Anglaise sauce wasn't bad, but everything else was not sweet enough, and I don't have a very heavy palette D: 
The texture was hard and slightly rubbery (ew!) and I ate about half until the Anglaise sauce was finished, then didn't finish it. Sorry for wasting food...  Boo.

Thus: my rating is a 3/5 star. Would I go back again? Maybe. I might go if I was around in the neighborhood, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go there again. I hate to say this, but It was a slightly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"A group of us came to bodega for lunch during work. The restaurant was about 30% full so we got seated right away - and then it all went downhill.

We got $23 prix fixe which is a good deal considering the mains range from about $15-$25. I ordered:

- roasted beet salad
- beef bourguignon
- warm banana cake with toffee sauce. 

My workmates ordered the calamari salad, the salmon, cassoulet, and creme brulee.

Firstly the food is just.. meh. I have never had such unexciting french food. It all was lack luster, required some salt and just a little bit more care. The beef bourguignon was good but I could have made it at home. It needed more wine to add depth. 

I tried my friends cassoulet  - just awful. The dessert was good but not great. 

I could overlook the bland food if the service was good - however we were there for 2 hours!! It took forever and considering the restaurant wasn't busy and we ordered off of the prix fixe menu it makes no sense. 

Overall the food here can be made by any average home cook, and you won't have to spend two hours sitting hoping your meal will eventually come."}
{"text":"The trout was out of this world. Try the warm banana cake with hazelnut ice cream. It is delicious"}
{"text":"Me and my companion went to Bodega for their Winterlicious 2014 Prix Fixe Dinner. Having a relatively forgettable experience at another restaurant for Winterlicious 2012, we skipped out on 2013 and hoped to turn things around for this year. Bodega ended up providing a fine experience overall with mostly good food, but a few problems here and there.

The decor of the restaurant was elegant - dim lights, white linens and all. The staff was courteous and did not make us feel the least bit out of place inside. The noise level was moderate, not intimate - as a large party was in the other room.

I ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad as an appetizer, Slow Roasted Beef Short Ribs for the main and the Almond Pear Tart for dessert. My partner had the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, the Grilled Fillet of Atlantic Salmon for a main and the Bread Pudding for dessert.

As a whole, one of the biggest issues I had during my experience with Winterlicious 2012 was the portion sizes being much too small - an app the size of an amuse, the main the size of an app, et cetera. At Bodega, I found the portion sizes much more appropriate for a dinner, leaving me full but not bloated. 

The complimentary bread was warm, hearty and had a nice crusty exterior. I ate it without the butter provided and was quite happy with how it was made - likely baked the same day (though I'm not sure if it was baked in-house or bought from a local bakery).

I love cheese. Just having the warm goat cheese salad in the menu was a slam dunk in pleasing me. The salad came with a few raspberries which visually popped and provided a nice sweetness and freshness to counterbalance the richness of the cheese and tartness of the vinaigrette. There were mixed microgreens, sprouts and a large slice of just-to-the-point-of-almost-melting goat cheese on top of it all. The salad was delicious but was just slightly imbalanced for my taste.

There were maybe three or four berries for the whole salad, causing me to portion them to ensure I had some of it in every bite. On the other side of the equation was the slice of goat cheese: it was quite large - I had a full quarter of the cheese leftover after I finished all the greens.There were also bacon bits, but they tasted quite ordinary and felt as though they were added to make the dish more familiar to people who don't eat fine dining. I finished it all, and it was ultimately a delicious plate of food that could've been a bit more polished.

I tried a bit of the french onion soup and it probably just wasn't my cup of tea. The onion was strong and the melted cheese was strong, but the soup itself was very thin which felt strange to my palette. Perhaps with a slice of baguette to sponge up the soup or additional textural components and my opinion of it would be better.

My main was absolutely delicious - the jus was flavorful and plentiful. The meat was completely tender and well portioned - not to the point of belonging to a steakhouse or smokehouse but large enough for a proper meal. It came with some great vegetables with a nice balanced mix of tartness and sweetness and varying textures. The garlic mashed potatoes were nothing special, but nothing bad - loads of butter and a great creaminess and acted as a fine canvas to the other ingredients. Texturally engaging, flavorfully complex and well portioned, this main was divine.There were a few tiny bones throughout the meat, due to the nature of the cut of meat, but wasn't a particularly troubling issue for me.

The Almond Pear tart was served with a sabayon. The crust was thin but had a good snap to it. The portions of the tart with a bit of pear, almond and sabayon were a truly euphoric experience - something I would look forward to from the start of any meal. Unfortunately, those great bites were matched with equally dry and uninteresting bites of just almond and crust - with just a few slices of pear baked in and a paltry amount of sabayon served. If they were a bit more heavy handed with the sauce, things would have been perfect in my opinion, but the bites that chewed dry took away from the dessert as a whole. 

Overall, it was a memorable night with an experience that I don't get to have very often with my price range and personal preferences. Some moments of the night really were spectacular whilst others were slightly disappointing. The food was delicious but lacked a bit of balance - especially in the salad and dessert. I may be a bit nit-picky in the review, but as the price of a meal goes up, so does my expectations of it. It's a great experience to have once in a while, but I can't see myself financially or preferentially doing this too often.

3.5 / 5, closer to a 4 than a 3."}
{"text":"Looking at the menu and the physical space of the restaurant, my hubbys and I were excited to eat here. We were sorely disappointed in the mediocre food and uninterested service. My husband ordered off of the Summerliciious menu while I ordered off of the regular money:

- To start off with, we never received any bread before our meal. Initially, we thought perhaps this a norm for THIS restaurant however during our entree course we saw another table munching on what looked like delicious, thick slices of hearty bread.
- Our actual entrees (duck and fish) did not taste great especially when considering the price.
- The waiter never bought me a dessert menu and showed up with a creme brulee that husband ordered at the beginning of our meal when ordering off the Summerlicious menu. The creme brulee was small but delicious but honestly creme brulee is hard to mess up.
- One plus is that they offered a few tasty options for mocktails for those who don't drink alcohol.
I would not come here again, waste of time, waste of money and better options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Location Location Location.... I love Baldwin Village... and what I love more is that there is never a lack of multicultural dining experiences... from Italian to Mexican, to Indian and to my favourite... French.

I was introduced to Bodega by a friend after I was getting tired of the same restaurant options for date night. I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very cozy.. almost like being in someone's dining room (it's in an old house).. The service was great and they had a prix fixe (roughly $30).. but not only that, they had a wine prix fixe... 

The wine prix fixe essentially consisted of pairing a glass of wine with each meal. The only problem with this scenerio was that the next course would come before you could finish your wine = tipsy by the end of it!.

I would recommend:

Starters - Calamari Salad
Entree- Flat Iron Steak and Frites (BEST Steak I have EVER had)
Dessert- Creme Brulee or Warm Banana Cake

This place is perfect for date night or for going with a small group of friends . ( I went with 5 people and we had a great table in a back corner by the fire place)

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Really good prices if you go on cocktail hour. We sat a 3pm. The waiter was very friendly, as well as a fast service. The food was tasty, but I would have preferred a little more salt on the meals. Perhaps they were really tasty. We had pints of Estrella Damm beer at 5$. We had three tapas which were really good. The restaurant is really cozy and the outside part is good too. Cocktail hour is the time to go. 

We had,

3 tapas
3 pinta of Estrella Damm
1 mock-tail

Total price: 44.34 with taxes."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch before going to the AGO. It was a Sunday around 11:30 and the restaurant was empty! The waitress was extremely nice. The food was amazing. I had the goat cheese salad. It was creamy and delicious. We followed that with crab cakes (which are full of crab - they aren't too bready) and pan seared scallops. The scallops were to die for. So good! All-in-all it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place because I was just in Baldwin. The pricing is reasonable for the portions, they had a winterlicious 38$ special. The flavours were good for the most part on all the items. Their Mushroom risotto had all the fresh aromatic flavours with different types of mushrooms and herbs. They had a delicious sticky toffee pudding-Esque type dessert but with banana bread. 

Service was okay. They were not readily available when we needed but the atmosphere is wonderful within the old Victorian home and nice fireplace. 

I would definitely suggest it as a last minute quick bite."}
{"text":"We went in the dog-days immediately after New Year, and although quiet, the service and food were still of high quality.
It is exactly what you would expect from a good French Bistro. Good steak frites with excellent frites. Well executed salads and fine fish alternatives. Oh, and a lovely mushroom risotto, by the way.
Full and reasonable wine list."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious 2017 lunch for $23.

The layout of the restaurant is pretty interesting: the restaurant is split into two halves. When you arrive, you would go towards your left. If you're seated on the right half of the restaurant, there's an exit on that side so you don't have to walk around the entire room.

At the entrance, there's a small room for coat check, but there's also a sign that says they hold no responsibility if anything is stolen. Well, guess I won't be using that...

We ended up waiting an extra 10 minutes, but we were seated at a nice big round table with more than enough room for 6 of us, so it not too bad. Restaurants can't predict when customers will decide to leave and we got our seats shortly.

The rooms have a very homey feel to it. All the tables are kind of close together, and the main room has a fireplace going. Lighting in general is pretty dim if you're not near one of the windows. No Wifi though.

Washrooms are located in the basement. Finding the washrooms themselves is a bit of a challenge since they're located at the back of the corridor, and along the way you'll see a bunch of other doorways that lead into places like the kitchen and so on. Feels like a collision waiting to happen if someone's rushing out with food. They are maintained well, though the basket of disposed paper towels could look a bit better.

Complimentary bread is offered with butter on the side. Good bread; really soft, with a crunchy crust.
You can ask for refills on the bread.

I ordered the Rabbit & Pistachio Terrine, the Duck Confit & Cassoulet, and the Chocolate Mousse. The portion sizes are quite filling. I've never had rabbit so I can't tell you whether it tastes like rabbit or not, but it was this flat piece of meat which I kind of wish looked a bit more natural. Tasted alright. A little salty, but does have a particular flavour that I can only assume is rabbit.

The duck confit was good, however it is on the salty side. You get a nice big duck leg with a crispy skin and somewhat tender meat. I enjoyed the flavour of the beans at the bottom as well.

The chocolate mousse...well, it's chocolate mousse. You can't really go wrong with chocolate mousse!

It took some time to get the machine for payment. Seems like they don't have that many machines to go around so if several groups are ready to go there's going to be some delay.

I think it's an alright place."}
{"text":"I love the location and the staff and the menu and the patio. But all the food was ho hum. Nothing terrible, but all of it was lacklustre. We tried scallops, poutine, beet salad and crab cakes.  Meh. It felt as if a line cook from TGI Friday was subbing in and doing a decent job of getting food out in time."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience.  This place is my boyfriend's fav restaurant in this city and I see why.  My favourite part of their set up is the wine pairings that go with your different courses.  Please go here!  It is great!"}
{"text":"My cousin had his engagement dinner here, so we had half the restaurant and bar to ourselves and much of the outside patio. 
I was really impressed. It was small and classy but it didn't feel try-hard or snobby at all. The bartenders were are really sweet and helpful. We all had a shot together at the end of the night! :)

The food was delicious!!!! Really nice place, I'd totally recommend it."}
{"text":"I organized a girls lunch for a warm Saturday afternoon.  Bodega was not our first choice - none of us had been there. We were actually scheduled to go to One in Yorkville. 
After re-evaluating menu's and reviews, we decided to go with Bodega. I cannot stress what a perfect choice Bodega was.

From the moment we walked the restaurant row of Baldwin Village, to the steps of Bodega, it was bliss. The patio seating for our group was perfect.  We were seated in a corner of the patio with greenery for privacy. The service from the get go was neutral. It wasn't overly friendly but it was not bad. Throughout the lunch I suppose the waitress warmed up to us. 

The waitress was very patient with the 5 of us, through our orders. The food was brought up in unison, which is always amazing. Each course was well portioned, and delicious. I had gone for the mussels to start - about 8 mussels.  Very tasty sauce, and clean mussels. My main was the trout, which was crusted and beautifully presented. My dessert was the fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Overall it was an absolute value for 3 courses PLUS a mimosa for $23.00. We kept ordering drinks and chatting well after lunch, embarrassingly it went on for about 8 hours...in turn it became dinner time! (We walked over to Chinatown for that!).  We were never asked to move, never felt hurried to leave, even though many walk-in's were seen entering the patio area. Did I mention after she brought the bill as one total, she quickly acted on breaking up the bill upon request?  

Overall, it was the perfect choice as stated before. Food 4 stars, service 4 stars. And it was not that the food or service was that outstanding. It was not innovative food, it was not cutting edge modern fusion.  This is a traditional French Cuisine restaurant. It was the simplicity of the fresh food and amicable service that worked together."}
{"text":"Bodega has a nice romantic, french-inspired atmosphere that is nice for a quiet meal.  The prix-fixe menu, so very french, is a good option.  The portion sizes are well balanced for a nice three course meal.  All around, the restaurant is solid across each dimension: food, service, ambiance, however it doesn't spike to great in any one area.

The driver behind the three star review is the food:  We had the goat cheese and onion torte and the crab cakes as starters.  The crab cakes were heavily fried and were not as flaky as I would like.  For mains, I had the cassoulet with duck confit which was very nice (although I didn't expect a duck leg as the confit).  My husband had the steak frites which was good but nothing spectacular.  For dessert, I had the creme brule but the sugar coating on the top was slightly burned.  The dish had just been taken out of the refrigerator as the bottom of the custard was still cold - this also makes it challenging to properly melt the sugar on top."}
{"text":"This is really a hidden gem. Best date place!

I left my ring on the bathroom counter and only realized two hours later. I called, expecting to hear the usual \"no we haven't seen it, sorry\", but boy was I wrong! A lovely lady named Robin put me on hold while she went and checked if it was still there! Are we in Toronto? And to my relief, she said that she found it! Unbelievable. I am so impressed by the integrity and class of Bodega's patrons and staff. 

1. Very cozy and romantic atmosphere. Classy crowd and lovely music. Great ambiance. 

2. Great service. Our waiter was a very nice and charming fellow, I think that he may be one of the owners. He took our order quickly and we didn't have to wait long for our drinks and courses. 

3. Winterlicious menu was fabulous. We got the crab cakes, lamb, salmon, mousse, and blueberry bread pudding. Everything was delicious and Presentation was beautiful. The only thing that wasn't very impressive was the goat cheese salad...it was a little small and I couldn't taste the raspberry vinaigrette. The goat cheese was splendid though. My date loved the blueberry pudding dessert. Upon trying a bit of it (it was originally mine) he immediately traded with me. I was really full so I didn't mind, the mousse was light and perfect.

4. The portions are proportionate! I was full by dessert! 

5. The wine was lovely. We had the merlot and the Pinot grigio I think."}
{"text":"Bodega is a cute restaurant in Baldwin village.  We visited on a Monday night so there was no wait for a table.  The servers were polite and attentive.  The menu, although small, caters to varied tastes.  I had the mushroom risotto and was really impressed with how creamy it was.  The calamari appetizer tasted lovely and wasn't too oily.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"***BRUNCH REVIEW***

Bodega is nestled in a residential area on Baldwin Street, itself being a house-converted restaurant.  While one may think that such restaurants would go undetected compared to those on major streets, Baldwin Street is reeling in the crowds.  Bodega is neighbour to the likes of Elle M'a Dit and Kinton Ramen.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon with one of my girlfriends for brunch, which is served between 11AM - 3PM.

The coat room rids the restaurant of the usual bulk and clutter.  The restaurant is separated into two rooms, with the bar on the left.

Don't expect any reverse spherification or artsy-fartsy presentation - but do expect delicious food.  The food here can be described as classic French done really well, with a few surprises here and there.

Cue the Pan Seared Scallops ($12) - which sit atop a bed of spinach and slice of sautéed apple in a light curry cream sauce.  I definitely had my reservations about the curry dominating the natural flavours of the scallops, but it was light as the menu said.  This generous 3-scallop serving was perfect for sharing.   It's good to know that not every restaurant charges you $18+ for one lonely scallop to show up at your table as you bumble through the task of slicing it 2 ways and transferring it onto sharing plates. (Yes, if you want to be my friend, then you'll have to share!)

I opted for the Terrine du Foie Gras ($19) which is labelled as a house specialty.  I took them up on their pairing recommendation of a 2 0z. glass of Henry of Pelham Late Harvest Riesling ($9).  The terrine had a smooth mouth-feel even if erring on the side of un-spreadable and served with tiny slices of toasted baguette.  Think cream cheese vs. block cheese - this one definitely leaned more towards the block cheese.  The greens could've benefited from a toss in the salad bowl as I felt like a cow on the pastures eating this unadorned roughage.

For our mains we opted opted to \"eat like the boys,\" with a Grilled Steak Sandwich ($14) and my Grilled Sterling Silver Flat Iron Steak with Eggs ($18).  My steak was cooked to a nice pink medium-rare, with baby bok choy, cabbage, fingerling potatoes and onions.  I thoroughly enjoyed feeding my cold with this juicy slab of protein, but the onions were cooked to a mush which garnered images of semi-liquid and bland foods that one eats when one's sick.  I didn't try my girlfriend's sandwich, but she said it was a bit chewy.  The healthy serving size also meant she had to take half to go.

The service at Bodega is attentive without being intrusive.  The servers topped up our glasses of water when they were running low, and checked in with us from time to time.

We finished off our afternoon affair with a foamy latte and coffee.   We unfortunately didn't end on a sweet note as we had originally intended as we were comfortably full.

I would definitely recommend Bodega as a brunch spot as the atmosphere is very cozy and homey and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. We were seated and never saw a server for 20 minutes.  Ordered drinks, out of Malbec on a Tuesday ?? I ordered the IPA on tap it was good. The huge disappointment was I order the Foie Gras they say house specialty. I ordered the full order .  It came as a pate. BRUTAL! Never mentioned it was a pate! I was so disappointed this dish is hard to find and it wasn't the real deal. So you get 2 slices of this and some crackers for $18.  I have to mention the other meals were ok. Soup was not hot. Soup should be hot."}
{"text":"I like Bodega's. I have been several times for lunch. Food has always been good and the atmosphere is very conducive for lunch meetings. A quick hop from the discovery district."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterliscious on a Saturday night. Only reservation was at 5 pm. Happy Hour drinks from 4 to 630 so it worked out nicely. 5 dollar pints and 6 dollar cocktails. Awesome!!!

Had the crab cakes which were excellent. The beef rib was only OK. And the maple pudding was the best part of the meal.

Service was prompt but not that inviting or friendly. Very transactional but at least our water was always filled. The decoration was nice and charming (converted old house)."}
{"text":"3.5*

I came here tonight for a corporate sponsored dinner - we were a party of around 17-20 people, and were seated in the semi-private dining area on the right side of the restaurant. The atmosphere of the restaurant (as many yelpers agree), is warm and cozy. They aren't trying for anything avant garde or modern here; it is classic and elegant. Service wise, I have no major complaints. The food was served in a timely manner and the dishes were taken away relatively promptly, during the brief interludes between presentations. Wine and water glasses were refilled at good intervals (although for some reason at one point, a server looked at my half empty glass and chose not to fill it...perplexing). 

We had the $43 prix fixe menu - I started with the blue crab cakes, 7 oz beef tenderloin, and the chocolate/espresso/Bailey's flourless cake. I liked the crab cakes (2) - the coating was super crisp, the filling was unctuous, the tomato provencale (basically cooked salsa) was refreshing, and the ancho mayo left a enjoyably slow burn on my tongue. The beef tenderloin (with scalloped potatoes, green beans and carrots) was cooked spot on. The grill marks were beautiful, and the cook (medium rare) was near perfect. Scalloped potatoes were a bit lacklustre, but the peppercorn and cognac sauce made up for it. While I thought that the cake was good (because it's chocolate), it's not fantastic. The pecan tart with ice cream would have been a much better choice (crunchy crust, and creamy ice cream). 

Special mention goes to the free bread - it's pretty great. It is a multi-grain/rustic bread, served warm. It has a fluffy inside, and a crunchy/crisp (crunchy implies that it was hard, but it was more like a heartier crisp) crust. Washrooms were strange - you have to go downstairs into the basement, through a door (with a paper sign pointing to it, indicating \"restrooms\"), and all the way to the end of the hallway. Why so many doorways?????"}
{"text":"My friend booked a winterlicious lunch at this French restaurants for $23. There was 3 courses, Entree, Main Course and Dessert. For the Entree, we have a choice of soup of the day (creamy mushroom), Sweet and Bitter Green, Rabbit & Pistachio Terrine, and Escagot & Fussilli. I took the escagot, which was heavy due to the creamy rose sauce. In addition to the entree, I've ordered an extra French Onion Gratinee Soup for $10, which I wasn't too impress as I've tasted better but at least it kept me warm. For the main course, I've chose the Duck Confit & Cassoulet, which is a bowl with one duck leg. Loved the tenderness of the duck, but not a fan of the cassoulet. I've sampled my friend's Beef Bourguignon which tasted amazing. The other choices for the main course were the Grill Salmon and a Quiche Florentine. As for dessert, I've took the Chocolate Mousse over Creme Brulee and Pecan Tart. The mousse was soft like chocolate fudge. Overall I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to Bodega for lunch yesterday (Sunday) for lunch.  We decided to go because they were having a $20 prix fixe special for Winterlicious (http://www.toronto.com/winterlicious).  

Bodega is located on Baldwin Street (\"Baldwin Village\") which is jam-packed with restaurant after restaurant.  Bodega seems to be on the higher end compared to most of its neighbors.

For my appetizer I had a calamari salad with frisee lettuce and my husband had the creamy mushroom soup.  For our mains, he had the rabbit with mashed potatoes and I had the vegetable tower (trying to be healthy!).  For dessert we both ordered the banana cake (not healthy)!

The appetizers were tasty and just the right size.  I also really enjoyed the hearty bread served with lunch. It was tempting to fill up on!  My main course was excellent.  The vegetables were topped with goat cheese and a tasty sun-dried tomato sauce.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was pleasantly surprised because I was under the impression that French restaurants did not have the best vegetarian options.  Bodega proved me wrong.

Highlights of the restaurant included the friendly service, the romantic atmosphere and the amazing banana cake dessert.  If they feature it on the regular menu, I think I will go back just for that.  I took off one star because they were out of the duck confit cassoulet, which I was surprised since it was one of the four fixed menu options. . .but we were there quite late for lunch (2:30pm and the kitchen closes at 3pm), so I suppose it's understandable."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and best friend for her 20th birthday. First thing that I felt as we walked in, the servers didn't really take us seriously. Most of the patrons there looked a lot older than us(business folks). It took forever for our server to take our orders (even our drink orders) and the restaurant was relatively empty. 

When our food finally came, the portion sizes were on the smaller side. I was really shocked at the size of my boyfriend's steak though. It was minuscule! And to be honest, his plate didn't look good what so ever. Also, my paella was supposed to come with mussels but it came with chicken instead. Our server didn't inform me that they ran out of mussels when I ordered. 

The ambiance is really nice though."}
{"text":"So I'm fairly new to Toronto and thus very new to Winterlicious...This little place was my first stop on the Winterlicious road and it was flat out AMAZING! 

I really enjoyed everything about Bodega; the area was cute, the restaurant was decorated in a very timeless classy manner, the food was topnotch and the price wasn't! Really what more do you want? In addition to the food, the wine suggestions my the waitstaff were spot on. This is a great date spot or just a nice place to have a weekend lunch or dinner that's dependably awesome!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Baldwin village, this cute little house turned restaurant looks like a great place to go on a date. It was. The atmosphere is great and it was exactly what I was looking for. That's where it stopped.

Upon entering this establishment, I was presented with the dilemma of going left or right...my instinct is to go right but I would've been wrong and should go left. When entering the room on the left there is no defined host(ess) station so I awkwardly stood there waiting for someone to see me and seat me but I did not see a single server. I stood there contemplating what to do next, should I walk in further, ring a bell, do a little dance? After what seemed like forever, a server came out of the kitchen and greeted us and sat us or well pointed to a table to sit at.

I informed my partner that there was a prix fixe menu available to choose from but when sorting through the menus didn't find the one that stated what was on the prix fixe. We then had to ask our server about the prix fixe and only then did he get us the menu that states what is part of it. 

Service was okay, not exceptional but standard. Took our order in a timely fashion and cleared our plates when we were both done but he never came to check on us about how our meals tasted because I probably would've told him that my pasta was gross. Okay I probably wouldn't have but I thought about it. When asking if we wanted any wine, my partner gave a polite no and then he turned to walk away before asking me if maybe I wanted a glass (which I did) and I had to quickly indicate that I wanted a glass before he turned away. 

I had the french onion soup for appetizer and it was phenomenal! I love french onion soup and it's quite difficult to find a decent tasting one. This was all cheese and bread and the littlest amount of soup base which was so good. It is large and once I got to about the middle, I started to get a little sick of eating such a large amount of cheese but it was still very good.

I had the vegetarian pasta as my entree and it was subpar. The noodles were not cooked right and there were many clumps of pasta in my plate and the pieces of vegetables were so small, the only thing I could point out was zucchini. I was not impressed at all. But for dessert, I had my favourite creme brulee, it's quite difficult to screw up a creme brulee so of course it was really good and was a decent capper to my not so great experience.

I'm being generous with the star rating because I actually had a really good time and that was not in correlation to my dining experience. I believe it was the company and a little bit of the atmosphere thrown in there. I may come back to try brunch or other things on the dinner menu but it might be a while before I do that since I wasn't too impressed with this dining experience at all."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this restaurant on Baldwin street but never really had the chance to dine here. Came here for a staff luncheon.  They seem to advertise their prix-fixe menu a lot as there was a lot of signage outside. My colleagues and I ordered from the prix-fixe menu in which you get 3 course meal featuring an appetizer, entrée and dessert. I ordered the warm calamari salad, grilled chicken supreme and pecan tart. I also ordered an Estrella beer on tap so that was nice to complement the lunch. As we were waiting for our lunch orders, the restaurant gives complimentary warm bread which was quite soft and tasty. I must say, what a pleasant lunch the day before a long weekend!! The warm calamari salad was a nice light salad with nicely cooked calamari. Great way to start your meal. The chicken was delicious and cooked to perfection. It was moist, juicy and well-seasoned- quit the delectable dish. For the finishing touch, the pecan tart was a good way to finish off an already enjoyable meal. The tart was warm and sweet topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Staff were pretty prompt with the orders and making sure they refilled our waters. Service was great and the décor here is nice. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and I would definitely come back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with 3 friends and we had a lovely evening. 

Service 5/5 for the management staff. My friends and I had an 8:15 reservation (because that was the only one available) but wanted an earlier seating so we went around 6pm hoping we could wait for an earlier table but the restaurant was hosting a huge party that night and had very limited seating. The manager assured us he would do everything he could to get us seated sooner and sure enough, by 7:30 we had a beautiful spot on the patio.

Service 4/5 for our waitress. She was nice but not very attentive. One of my friends ordered the steak and fries and our waitress forgot to bring ketchup, even after my friend asked for it. We also had to constantly ask for our waters to be refilled. However the food came out at a really good pace and we had lots of time to eat and rest in between. 

Food 4/5: I started with the warm calamari which was tender and tasted great with the sun dried tomatoes, capers and lemon. For my main I had the bouillabaisse which was a small portion but the tomato broth was tasty. The scallops were a tad bit undercooked for my liking but very fresh. Salmon was the market fish and it was moist and flaky. For dessert i had the key lime which I didn't like that much. It wasn't tart enough for my liking. My friends started with the beet salad which was great although one of them didn't love the blue cheese. One of them also got the steak which was fine but nothing amazing. The fries however were really good, with a natural sweet taste. One of them also got the raspberry creme brûlée which i liked better than the key lime. We also tried their raspberry lemonade and grape fruit elderflower fizz which were both perfect summer drinks! Light and refreshing, perfect for a hot day. 

Atmosphere 4/5: The patio is the perfect spot for a romantic date. It has lots of flowers, lights and comfortable seating. Inside was stark, plain and too hot as there was no c/a."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have been to on Baldwin Street. The food is delicious, very French and really well flavored and sauced.
 Service is a little slow and -1 star. For the cost and the quality of food the service should not be amateur. For example, simply because one of our party had not yet arrived, that is no excuse to leave us unattended for the first 20 minutes without even water.
The food is really good though. The room is lovely, very cozy and homey. i would go back simply to try more of the selection. They had prix fixe for lunch but some of the choices were not available, so we all went with the regular menu. I had the escargot and sweetbread app, and a grilled swordfish entree. Others had french onion soup and loved it, duck and paella entrees. Universal praise for the food. Even the bread they served was excellent. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Birthday Celebration. Who's? MINE :) 
Venue: Bodega
Specialty: French
Menu items:  French Onion Soup Gratinee and Pan Seared Scallops with Prawn Ravioli.
Wine Pairing: Italian Pinot Grigio 

French cuisine is amongst the most celebrated types of cuisines in the world. Is delicate, yet rich; buttery, yet balanced and it does not make you fat. Ok, the last statement is probably not 100% true, but according to best selling author, Mireille Guiliano, French women don't get fat!   And that my foodies, its true.  Because its all about food portion control, and a place like Bodega with the decent size portions validates this.

Bodega is a restaurant located in the famous Baldwin street, which really consists of an almost half a block strip stuffed with 10 or so restaurants.  I believe Baldwin to be a very unique street with tons of good variety.  If you are foodie, you will know about this street for sure.

I started my lovely French meal with a staple, French onion soup.  
The soup's recipes, to my knowledge, is one of the easiest to make. Getting the ingredients to balance in one's palette, is a whole other thing.  This soup was perfection - not too salty, not too oily and with the right balance of onions.  I was very happy my meal had a great start.

Next, I had the Ravioli appetizer as a main. One of the neat things about Bodega is that you can turn any appetizer into a entree, so I did.
The ravioli was extremely fresh and was stuffed with the prawns. The scallops where hanging around next to them and drizzled with a lovely Saffron cream sauce.  If I can add, I am a saffron fan and if I find this ingredient in any restaurant menu, I am most likely to order that dish...just because of the saffron, yum! Any who, the ravioli was topped with crispy onions which gave it a nice touch and balanced the creaminess of the sauce to give it a crunchy texture.  I would highly recommend this dish.

I would give this restaurant a 4/5.  To get to the 5, I would recommend adding some more French staples to the menu and improving the duck meat quality."}
{"text":"What started out as a torrential downpour Friday evening, it thankfully cleared up by 7pm just in time for our 8pm reservation.  In the heart of small Baldwin Village Bodega was a first time for all of us!  Dim, intimate, and classy Bodega is a hidden gem in this victorian style house.  The beautiful decor, crystal white table clothes, comfy seating, and ambience is the perfect setting for a beautiful evening.  Summerlicious menu had some great choices and here's my review!!

escargot and sweetbreads 5/5
fusilli, pommery mustard, brandy, tomato, and cream!!
Ive always wanted to try Escargot! and I'm glad I ordered it.  Perfect melody of flavors from the pommery mustard, cream, and brandy made this dish! and added some added flavor to the escargot! The fusilli was a nice addition to the dish, much like a mini pasta salad!

grilled alberta flat iron steak  4.5/5
shallot butter and frites: Cooked to perfection....MEDIUM!.  Tender, and full of flavor! and as always a little butter goes a long way.  The homemade frites were so delish! a plate alone would have been yum....actually... an extra side order!

strawberry rhubarb tart with whipped cream 5/5
Wish I could have ordered a second serving!!! sort melt-in-your-mouth!....simply yum. 

The service at first was a bit slow, but later on picked up his slack!! nonetheless a gem that I will definitely be visiting soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious and had lunch. I had the carrot and carraway soup -- delicious, then the beef bourgignon-- incredible, and the banana bread pudding-- the highlight of the meal. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for great food with a slightly more casual vibe. The interior is beautiful and sunny during the day, and features a full bar and seating at the bar, along with tables. It feels like a beautiful English countryside pub. This is definitely fine dining, and the service was very friendly, though not quite as attentive as it could have been."}
{"text":"Tried this place on Winterlicious. Fair price for its environment, location and food quality. I did not particular like the salad but the rabbit leg turned out to be good."}
{"text":"bodega has such romantic, cozy, french antique-y inspired atmosphere. perfect for a romantic candle lit dinner .i've been here twice, first time about 2 years ago and the latest being last weekend. 

our first time was pretty good . I dont remember what we had, but i do remember they had an amazing beet salad . im a straightup meat eater and very rarely compliment a salad but this was soooo good . its a lot more memorable than the actual entrees we had . even after 2 years, unforgettable !

when we went back last weekend for lunch, the boy & i had a 3 course meal from the winterlicious menu while his mom had a regular lunch menu . 
- for appetizers we had, french onion soup, baked goat's cheese tart and calamari salad . nothing was too outstanding . my calamari salad was a complete meh & bleh . goat cheese tart was pretty good, the pastry was nice & flakey and the cheese was very rich that went pretty well w the pastry .
- for mains we had, grilled steel head trout, cassoulet w duck confit & lamb . my trout was a bit dry and not a lot of flavor . my bf's duck confit was a disaster . it was soooo dry . his mom's lamb, however, was perfectly cooked . it was full of flavor and melted in your mouth .
- for dessert, we had white chocolate mousse cake which was pretty good but i still wouldve prefered mousse cakes from asian bakeries & the banana cake that tasted exactly like how my mom makes them at home  . boooooo !

the bill came to a little over $100 for lunch. stuff we ordered from the regular menu was really good (this time & the first time), but i cant say the same for the winterlicious menu ."}
{"text":"It's a worth mentioning that this review is solely based on my Winterlicious experience and may or may not reflect the quality of their regular food/service.

The atmosphere is good. You sense that this establishment has history in this space. Dimly light, warm and cozy vibes with signature white table cloths and rustic chandeliers. The stage is set and seems like it's going to be a refine meal with impeccable service. However, the truth is quite far from what they appear to be.

Whilst the service was adequate I wouldn't necessarily compliment it. There's the usual \"hello, how are you? Can I take your order?\" and.... that's where it ends. There was no offer to refill our beverages even though we had emptied them before we were on to our main. No concerns regarding how our meal was. No small talk/chit-chat/jokes....not even a smile. And last but not least...no goodbyes or thank yous. No, it wasn't busy like a flea market, it was just a casual Wednesday evening. That in there sums up the experience. Perhaps, and I hope this is just restricted to Winterlicious.

On to the food. It was forgettable at best and some of it was not great. Beef cheek was overcooked/over-charred. My fish was well-well-done. In fact, that is probably the theme of the meal \"well-well done\". Seafood -- well-well done. The only saving grace might have been the peach dessert and the creme brulee(but who messes this up anyways?).

All in all, a very forgettable experience not worthy of my time."}
{"text":"I've been to Bodega twice: once for brunch, once for dinner. The ambiance of the place is quite nice, and i'd say it's a nice place to go on a date. The food is quite good: they serve an assortment of French dishes. Mains will run you from around 25-35 dollars. The service is usually fairly slow; the servers are friendly and courteous, so I don't think that is a deal-breaker for the place."}
{"text":"I had a summerlicious date here for lunch with my friend and boyfriend.  Unlike some places, they allowed some people to order off of the summerlicious menu and some people not to.  

The interior gave me a New Orleans feel, from the decor to the music being played.  Beware on a hot day, they don't have a/c, just ceiling fans.  They do have a nice large patio with lots of umbrellas along a busy pedestrian street, so nice for people watching and enjoying the sun.  

I had the crab cakes to starts, the lamb for my main and the raspberry creme brulee to end it off.  We had some bread to start, which tasted homemade.  The crab cakes were absolutely delicious.  I would definitely order these again.  You get 2 quite hearty portions, which a delicious rancho mayo.  The lamb chops were not the best I've had.  A little burnt, small and overdone.  The blueberry sauce was okay.  The lamb was accompanied by a chef's salad, which was tasty.  They won be me back with the raspberry brulee.  Not too sweet, and had that perfect crust at the top that is so enjoyable to break.

My friend had the same as me except the veggie fritatta.  A good sized portion, and looked full of veggies.  My boyfriend just ordered the steak frites off the menu.  He didn't really care for it.  Although the fries looked good, he said the steak wasn't cooked well and not great quality.  However, for the price, he also wasn't expecting much.  

The service was quite slow.  Only seemed to have two servers for the patio (who I think were doing double duty inside as well)."}
{"text":"Ho hum....I'm no fancy food expert.  I'm the type of person that would probably eat with my bare hands if I had to because well it's too fancy to use utensils....

Came here for a staff christmas party two years ago.  Granted I'm no fancy food connoisseur by any means.  

They had a prix fix menu, I think I got some kind of fried scallop, main dish and creme bruele.

I had steak and frites (that's fries for all you regular folk).  Steak was just ok, no HP sauce (see I told you I was food bumpkin!). 

Fried scalop tasted like something lower end than red lobster, the breading was very oily.  The creme bruele was ok, had a nice crisp top.

Service was equally meh, our group wasn't that big maybe 15 people tops and I found the head waiter to be standoffish.  BTW, he wasn't the one I asked for HP sauce.

Give me the keg anyday over this place for the price and value."}
{"text":"A cosy and welcoming French bistro on Baldwin Street, serving up a great prix fixe menu for 25$ during lunch hours. They accommodate large groups as well. 

I recommend their salmon gravlax which is cured with hints of sweetness. The Icelandic cod was carefully cooked with an amazing beurre blanc.

I would recommend their patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"I took my wife there for a special evening. I have to admit I was a bit nervous about the French menu. We usually prefer experimenting, and the idea of an evening of traditional (read: stuffy) French cuisine had me wondering.

I shouldn't have worried. My wife had a wonderful pairing menu, and I opted to pick and choose from the main menu.

Everything food wise was wonderful. The flat iron steak was out of this world, done exactly as I had requested it.

The wine selection was superb, and I even managed to find a Chilean wine I had 5 years ago and forgot. The manager brought out the bottle for me to confirm the vintage after I told him the story with no coaxing from me.

The staff was polite, happy and attentive. We were served by three people over the course of a 3 hour evening, all them in great spirits and knowledgeable of the menu and cellar.

The atmosphere was wonderful. The front room is small, seating about 35 people in th living room of an old Toronto estate house. The conversation was alway audible if you listened, but easy to tune out with your own. Laughter carries across the room.

We will be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for a french winterlicous lunch and was content with my meal.  Nothing really stood out that impressed me and everything I tasted was average.  Restaurant was busy with a few people waiting in line for a table.  I had reservations for 6 people.  Didn't get a table until after 10 minutes of waiting. Decor seemed like a house converted into a restaurant.  Wasn't much space to walk around to get to our table. Washroom was more like a fast food washroom.

Was able to try many of the dishes.  
The complimentary bread had hard & crunchy crust yet was soft & fluffy in the middle. Bread would break apart when spreading butter on it. Bread was great with finishing off sauce left on our plates. They were nice to give us extra bread when we asked for it.

Rabbit & pistachio terrine with Fig & tomato chutney, crostini.  Was full of good flavours where the herbs and spices overpowered the taste of the rabbit.  If I was told it was chicken or pork I would have believed it.  

Escargot & fusilli with morel mushroom & brandy cream sauce.  Size of dish was small with few pieces of escargot.  The fusilli was firm and chewy which I didn't like.  The sauce and flavours of the whole dish were ok.

Beef bourguignon with yukon gold mash, market vegetables, red wine & herb sauce.  Tasted pretty much like beef stew with no soup.  Wish the beef had more gelatin or fat within the meat.  Vegetables, mash potatoes and sauce were all good.

Duck confit & cassoulet beans Crispy duck leg, braised navy beans, Toulouse sausage, bacon.  The duck was too salty for me.  I did like the tenderness of the duck and flavour of the duck.  The sausage and bacon tasted like they were boiled in water for too long.

Pecan tart with vanilla ice cream.  Was a little sweeter than I liked.  Other than that the flavours were good.  Had a variety of textures which I liked.  

I'd recommend going with Rabbit & pistachio terrine, Beef bourguignon and Pecan tart."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for French food.
Decent place, good service, food is pretty delicious
Price is pretty high, three people ~160$"}
{"text":"I have been dining, albeit infrequently, at Bodega for well over a decade. In that time I can't remember one disappointing meal let alone a dish. Our post-Georgia Okeeffe AGO exhibit lunch was no exception. We chose from their prix fixe menu, $23. Which includes a starter, main course and dessert or latté/cappuccino.

In this rain-drenched summer, enjoying a rare sunny day on their patio was so inviting. However, all the shaded spots were filled so we reluctantly sat indoors to avoid direct sunlight. A decision our dermatologist would, no doubt, approve of.

Their cream of mushroom soup was as promised: quite creamy, sufficiently pureed and with a pronounced mushroom taste. Portion size was quite generous and filling.

I ordered their Lamb Chops medium rare as my main. It was perfectly cooked. The red wine reduction sauce it came with heightened my enjoyment of this terrific dish. A substantial side salad of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes and what appeared to be flecks of quinoa was a welcome compliment. 

My dining partner opted for the spinach Quiché sided by properly executed double fried frites. Her warm and very appealing Quiché was encased in a terrifically flaky crust. In true bistro fashion, an offer of mayonnaise for the frites was available, although ketchup was also on offer.

A sweet finish to a most pleasant lunch, with one service exception, was their warmed banana cake. Serving it warm made it that much more appealing to me. The decadent added light cream and butterscotch sauce ribbons just elevated it to a whole new level of enjoyment.

The aforementioned exception that somewhat marred our experience was how one server reacted to a fellow diner paying with a $100 note. They were initially informed that they don't have or can't make the change. However the bill was taken and after several minutes of silence, the proper change was provided. We immediately noticed that the coins consisted of nearly $3 in quarters. Was this a passive aggressive move or was their till really short of loonies and toonies? Hard to say for sure but we did feel a rather negative vibe from one of the servers. A shame because all in all, it was a very good meal."}
{"text":"After searching for a good French restaurant we made a reservation at Bodega for lunch.  
Delicious food, nice and polite waiters, and pleasant atmosphere. The next time we will go back there for brunch."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Toronto for a fancy, romantic dinner. 

I surprised my boyfriend with dinner here for his birthday last year - and the waitstaff (without me telling them) had a little cake with a candle in it after our meal was done! I was so impressed.

The service was outstanding, the food was so delicious!! Great wine, desserts and coffee too. The entire experience was memorable, and we can't wait for the next special occasion that we can celebrate there!

And it's on Baldwin, which is a great little street in its own right.

Since then, we've given a bunch of gift certificates to friends and family.

It's the perfect price for a special occasion, the atmosphere is very romantic and cozy, especially in winter time with the fireplace.

If you haven't been, you have to go!"}
{"text":"This place looked pretty nondescript on the outside as far as restaurants are concerned and it probably wouldn't have stood out as a nice place to eat to some random passerby. I strolled in on a Saturday afternoon hoping for the $20 prix fixe lunch, but apparently they only serve that on weekdays. Instead, I ordered the French toast off their brunch menu. It came loaded with berries, banana slices, whipped cream, and maple syrup - yummy! The portion size and flavour were fantastic for the price.

For those with allergies, their menu has a warning that they use peanut oil for a lot of recipes, so make sure to ask ahead.

The place was absolutely dead that afternoon and I chatted it up for quite a bit with the Bobby the super nice waiter. I promised him I'd come back for lunch in a few days but unfortunately I was too broke by then. :( Ah well, if I ever roll back in town!"}
{"text":"I love this place when it was summer time and now even winter time. During summer, they have a happy hour before 6pm. I would always order estrella and poutine for $5 each! I love their poutine!!! Also went here for winterlicious this year! Had a lamb. It was cooked to perfection. I dont remember the appetizer because i guess it wasn't really a hit. Sorry!! But the creme brulee and pudding were both amazing too."}
{"text":"I came for the first day of Summerlicious lunch. The atmosphere was nice, but the summerlicious menu food was just okay; maybe it just didn't mesh with my palate, i don't know, but I found the duck to be under-seasoned and a little dry, and the lemon tart way too sour with an extremely unpleasant after-taste; I had to go to the gelato place around the corner to chase away that taste. The service was great though, and I'd love to give it a 3.5 if I could, but based on the food, I can't really give it a 4, sorry!"}
{"text":"I'm very sad writing this updated review and knocking off two stars, especially after my tremendous visits last year. 

I went to Bodega once again this year for Winterlicious, and boy was I disappointed. The blue crab cakes that had me going back again and again last year at Summerlicious were so small this year, and so underwhelming compared to before. What came was ONE two-bite cake with a dollop of mayo and some tomatoes. Last year the appetizer was TWO full sized cakes, stacked with mayo and tomatoes, and made for an excellent starter.

I had the duck confit & cassoulet for my entree, and the duck was so soggy I had to remove and throw out the skin (which when crispy is the best part??). The white bean cassoulet was tasty, but was overly salty so I had to down about 3 glasses of water after eating half a serving. 

The pecan tart I had for dessert was good, but again the portion was very very small (probably 1/16th of the entire tart).

Overall, Bodega's prix fixe quality has gone down significantly. It no longer feels (tastes) like a good deal, nor do I have any desire to return and eat salty, tiny portions of food."}
{"text":"I chose Bodega for my department's Christmas Lunch at work; we have a large party and couldn't find anywhere that could accommodate our group and had a menu that everyone would enjoy. After some searching, I stumbled upon Bodega and the choice was made.

Bodega is a house that's been remodeled to be a restaurant. There are two front rooms and we sat in the larger one with the bar in it. I think bathrooms are in the basement but I didn't venture down there so I couldn't tell you!

We had a party of 11 for lunch so it took some time to get everyone's orders straightened away. The server was a bit aggressive in her approach to the table for the duration of the meal but that's probably just a personality thing. Our server was also the bartender, so she wasn't always paying attention when we needed drink refills or a new fork or something. 

I cannot go to a place like this and see poutine on the menu and NOT order it. WOW. OUT OF THIS WORLD. Soooo insanely good. If I hadn't been with my coworkers, I might have licked the plate clean. Such a delicious combination of mushrooms, cheese and fries. I ordered the lamb shank for lunch and again, OUT OF THIS WORLD. This lamb shank is the best I've ever had. It was smothered in some kind of delicious sauce with cranberry reduction and perched atop truffle mashed potatoes. A few of my coworkers tried the lamb shank and agreed that it was by far the best thing on the menu.

I was happily surprised with Bodega; I was a bit worried with some of the mixed reviews that I saw online, but Bodega pretty much hit it out of the park. We did have one negative, one of the servers handed a plate to my boss and it ended up burning his hand. It was an unfortunate occurrence, and I'm not sure if the restaurant did anything to make up for it, but otherwise, the meal was very good and everyone enjoyed. I look forward to coming back to Bodega again and perhaps trying that lamb shank again... excuse me while I drool onto my keyboard."}
{"text":"Hands-down, the best Summerlicious experience I've had, in four years of Licious-ing. Really, it's 4.5 stars. (When oh when are Yelp going to allow us to give half stars?!)

Came here for a weekday lunch after being told to get lost by harried staff at Midi Bistro around the corner (more on that in my next review). Bodega's patio is simply beautiful: large, shady, looking onto the sweet Baldwin St cafe strip and all of its action on one side, and the gorgeous old vine-covered red brick Victorian on the other. Comfy banquettes with a back just high enough to drape your arm comfortably over. Honestly, patios don't come much better than this. Plus, there's proper silverware, napery and glassware.

We were seated and attended to straight away by our lovely server, a guy with a lilting West Indian accent, who was friendly but not intrusive, and totally attentive throughout, despite the busy lunch period--no waving the bill down here. Clearly, someone at Bodega knows that hiring enough staff (and good staff) is crucial to keeping customers happy, a very basic hospitality lesson that you would think more restaurateurs and pub owners would have grasped by now... amirite?

The Summerlicious lunch prix fixe is $20 and features a few tasty-looking options. I had a chilled filet of sole mousse with a red pepper sauce; confit of duck with sweet potato, bacon and rosemary hash and green beans; and orange creme brulee. My date had the soup du jour (a chilled cucumber puree); the grilled steelhead trout with israeli couscous; and warm berries with vanilla ice cream.

The food was a little inconsistent, but generally very good. The standout dishes were my duck confit and his berries and ice cream. I was worried about ordering duck confit and sweet potatoes on such a hot day (30+C), but it was a nice small portion and it was really delicious--rich, moist, crispy-skinned. The sweet potatoes were fantastic--the bacony-oniony sauce they came in made them incredibly more-ish. His trout was a little overcooked, but the couscous was studded with raisins and pine nuts for interest, and pretty yum. My chilled sole mousse was a little blah, but he wolfed down his chilled cucumber soup, which was light, minty, and very refreshing. My creme brulee was beautifully executed: it had a lovely brittle crunchy top which was super-fun to crack with my spoon, and a nice delicate orange flavour. His dessert was outstanding: I don't know what they did to those berries--or maybe they are just perfectly in season right now--but they were the berriest-tasting berries I've ever eaten! A nice mix of strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries. Yummmmm.

Again, though, the things that really made it for me were the gorgeous surroundings, and the superlative service. Last night I was at The Rhino in Parkdale, where I waited literally forty-five minutes--no exaggeration--to get a lukewarm pint of beer. Here, I had a glass of beautifully chilled, crisp prosecco in my hand within eight minutes of sitting down. LOVE. IT.

Bodega is one of the (sadly very few) restos that know how to do Summerlicious right: don't cheap out, hire enough staff to cover the busy times, and make sure the food is impressive and done with care, not prefabricated crap that you're cranking out and trying to pass off as something fancy. I would definitely say that I've had more bad experiences than good during Summerlicious and if anything it has been most useful in weeding out the places I definitely won't go again. This, however, is not one of them. Well-played, Bodega!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Had escargot , grilled calamari and duck confit - shared all the meals (if I ordered the main, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it). Atmosphere is cozy with eclectic decor and color you can sense this place has history. Desert - creme brûlée and espresso. Desert was good, but comparable to other creme brulees I've had , as I am a fan of it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Eggs Florentine With Smoked Salmon on Toasted English Muffin With Two Poached Eggs, Spinach, Smoked Salmon, And Béarnaise Sauce for $13. I know, you are shocked with what I ordered. Yes, that was sarcasm. I tend to always order the same thing for brunch. I was a bit confused when this dish was placed in front of me. Never have I had this combination of sides for brunch. Side of fingerling potatoes, pickled cabbage and baby bok choy. Individually I like these sides, but together, specially with a creamy main, it just did not work. I did not have any inkling that I would be receiving these sides with my main. If I did, I definitely would have gone with fries. I was surprised that I did not like the fingerling potatoes. They just did not taste right. I can't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with them. Inasmuch as I was confused by the sides, I was overall satisfied with my Eggs Florentine. Though, I was thinking the craziest thing when eating my main; it had too much smoked salmon. I know, who thinks that?! There is usually never enough salmon! In this case I did find that the \"smoked\" aspect of the salmon was overpowering the other elements of the main. Would I order this dish again? Yes, but I would ask for fries as my side.

Angela and I ordered this dish because we wanted to end our meal on a \"sweet note.\" That was a good one eh.  Here you have Fresh Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with Berry Compote, Maple Syrup, And Whipped Cream for $10. Since we received all our mains at the same time, I expected this dish not to taste as good because it was sitting there while we attacked our mains. Once we finished our savoury dishes we put them aside and pulled this plate closer to us. I broke off a piece and put it in my mouth expecting it to taste cold and dry because I did not pour a gallon of syrup on them like I usually do with my pancakes. Wrong! Yes, they were no longer hot, but they still tasted fresh. We were specially a fan of the whipped cream. It was nice and thick, and the berry compote was not too heavy or overpowering as I expected it to be. You could hardly taste the maple syrup because of the tanginess and tartness of the berry compote. But this was not a deal breaker. We totally made the right decision to end our meal with these pancakes."}
{"text":"Homey restaurant in the busy streets of chinatown.  Great prefixed menu and had the Sautéed Duck Gizzard Confit, which tasted chewy, tough and bland.  Following the appetizer, i had the Flat Iron Steak & Frites, which was delicious!  This steak was perfectly seared and full flavored. For desert, I had the White Chocolate Mousse Cake With A Trio Of Coulis, which was not a surprising dish and was quiet ordinary and predictable.

Overall, this was an OK restaurant but nothing special that you couldn't find in any where else for the price.

Bon Appetit...winning the hearts of food lovers one tummy at a time!"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious dinner, shared a beef tartare a la carte (unfortunately this was very disappointing, without taste or bite), chose the escargot and sweet breads for app (tasty!) , beef ribs for main (not bad, but did not stand out) and the chocolate cake for dessert (too sweet and a bit plastic tasting imo) .  The atmosphere was adorable, a large old house converted into a restaurant. The waiter was very friendly, but we were sometimes left alone a bit too long.  Our dinner lasted nearly 2.5 hours as a result.  While it was a dinner over winterlicious and I know that can skew the experience, I must admit I was highly disappointed with the a la carte item.. And I'm not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"Casual french style dinning not too overyly fancy. A home feel to the atmostphere. The confit duck was very tasty but the foie gras wasn't cook properly. Good neighbourhood wait times are good. Wine list was a bit dry"}
{"text":"Great French restaurant on Baldwin st with a very sweet patio! It's a nice lunch spot for me since I work in the area and it's never super busy, although reservations are recommended. 

Recently dropped in for their lunch summerlicious menu which was excellent. Had their trout dish which was amazing, cooked perfectly! 

They have great drink specials during the week as well. Worth stopping by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went here for the happy hour specials. There were maybe 4 people in the entire place yet we waited 20 mins for a server to take our drink order. He may or may not have been stoned or drunk. Very inattentive- he walked away as we tried to order food.
The food arrived and the portions were VERY small. One bite crab cakes for $8 and a crostini drizzled in balsamic for $7."}
{"text":"Came with my group on the weekend for Winterlicious Lunch . The service  experience was excellent..  We  tried a bit of each others dishes .Now for an evaluation of the dishes ordered:

STARTERS

Sweet & Bitter Greens: Hearty salad with a healthy variety of greens and vinaigrette.

Rabbit & Pistachio Terrine:  Everything blended perfectly in this dish . Enjoyed it and you should too.  My only concern was that the crostini could have  been just a little softer   as it is easier to chew, and handle on the plate with cutlery. Otherwise a perfect start to the meal.

MAINS

chicken breast 'coq au vin': This dish  while presented well  but was a bit too dry . Considering it is supposed to be braised in wine, there was not much of a wine taste in it.  Do not order it 

duck confit & succotash: The duck  has a crispy skin, and very soft meat . The succotash  complemented the duck well . Order this  and enjoy it 

DESSERT

banana bread pudding :   Was decent. Banana flavour could have been a bit  stronger  considering it is a banana bread pudding. More rème anglaise & toffee sauce should be added so the pudding can be eaten easier.

berry cobbler:  Well presented and  tasted nicely . Was a bit difficult to work with when trying to scoop a piece to eat. Dont order it  

I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try. I would have loved to try the dinner but I like to try new things  and for a return trip the quality of some of the dishes needs to  improve ."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night. The restaurant is pretty quiet and we asked to be seated outside. They have a nice and quiet patio outside. 

I ordered from the prix fixe menu and started with the rabbit and pistachio terrine and had the flat iron steak, and finished with the raspberry creme brulee. I also had the strawberry gin and tonic. My friend had the scallops and the rainbow trout. The food was really good, I was a fan of the steak and creme brulee and my friend really liked the scallops. I wasn't the biggest fan of my gin and tonic. 

They weren't very busy so service was attentive and our food came out fairly quickly. Staff were super friendly. They have drink specials earlier in the evenings that ends around 6pm."}
{"text":"For tapas, we had
1)  mushroom and brandy poutine which  was disappointing. The poutine was lacking mushroom, brandy and cheese. It was honestly an overpriced and small order of French fries; not worth the $8

2) lamb sliders, cute and nicely presented but very very small. There was 3 sliders in one order and cost $12. Not worth the price tag

Entree, I had Caselette and Duck confit, decently priced at $23. Duck was good but the rest of the dish was too salty for my taste.
Overall it was an okay meal, not sure if I would return"}
{"text":"I was here for Valentine's day and the place was packed.  My boyfriend made a reservation at 8pm and there were still people coming in as we were leaving.  The restaurant was really nice, the decorate was beautiful.  The place was definitely fit for a romantic dinner.
Besides the decor, the food was delicious too.  We started with the escargot appetizer which was really (I have never had it before).  For entree, we got the lamb and the eggplant with feta cheese tower.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the eggplant and cheese was amazing too.

Overall, I would definitely come back for a special night out.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Summerlicious - Decent menu, wait staff was nothing special, lovely atmosphere.

Ordered the crab cakes, steak and fries and creme brûlée. The crab cakes were delicious and still hot when it go to our table. Crispy outside and soft flaky crab meat on the inside. The steak was cooked to medium rare as requested but the fries were a little plain and reminded me of McDonald fries. The shallot butter that came with the steak was amazing. Wanted the strawberry rhubarb tart for dessert but the menu suddenly changed so got the creme brûlée instead. Couldn't really taste the white chocolate in the creme brûlée.

Overall, would rather try the other restaurants on Baldwin St first before going back for a second time."}
