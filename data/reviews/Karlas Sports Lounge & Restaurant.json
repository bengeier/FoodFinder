{"text":"It's an awesome experience, the way you're greeted when you come in , the vibe puts you in ecstatic mood . The staff is wonderful , they'll greet like they've known you for years. They'll help with your own custom order and inexpensive as well . The food is so simple yet so elegant . Every thing is so fresh nothing is ever frozen or reheated all food is made fresh. Karla is a great owner, So fun when she's around.  The burgers are to die for !!!!The cowboy burger is one of the best burgers I have had in a while . The meat is so juicy and tender never a bad food experience when I'm there. Perfect ambiance to go relax and watch a game with you friends or on a first date ha ha."}

{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside-great place inside. Came her to watch Boxing match and the food and environment was great!"}
{"text":"Outside of bar can be and was misleading. To my surprise the inside decor staff food & happy hour are awesome. Love to stop here for an after work cool down. Sit back with a couple of cold ones and let traffic die down. Must come!"}
{"text":"Nice place. USED to be a serious dive bar so many years ago. It has been remodeled, gone through various owners and is now owned by Karla. Burger special is $4.99 with fries. Very good. Jalapeños poppers as an appetizer. This is bar food, frozen and deep fried. This can be good or bad depending on: temp of frying oil and how often it is changed. This is a sports bar with a cozy feel, comfortable, clean, just the right lighting, a smoking patio, plenty of flat screens and boxing decorum lining the walls- much of it signed. The burger was perfectly cooked, fries are fresh cut and seasoned. The jalapeños slices are battered and deep fried- no cheese, probably pre frozen but very good. They have several salad choices. Chicken Cobb salad and chicken slices in the Greek salad. Good place for food and beer or a drink!"}
{"text":"Went here 2 times their yelp says they're open & it was closed both times. I wanted their wings so badddddd :( why were they closed??"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place but when i read the reviews someone said they wouldn't take the restaurant.com coupons anymore.  They were right.  I called and they said no.  They need to take their name off of restaurant.com site.  I did have an entertainment book coupon which they took.  Ordered 2 burgers which were very good.  Alcohol prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Great little bar on a sketchy part of Grand Avenue right by the I-17 freeway overpass. Don't let the location fool you. The inside is super nice. Plenty of TVs for sports, good drink prices and great wings."}
{"text":"Small easy going and very friendly sports bar. The food was surprisingly very good. Had traditional Burger with deep fried jalapeño  peppers. I think they were sliced fresh and very good. Bar tender is very nice and fast. Great place to relax and hang for a while. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So, there was a shooting at our hotel 2 blocks away, and we needed someplace to pass the time until the police allowed access. This little dive looked sketchy from the outside, but we looked in, and decided to give it a shot.  This is Cheers in Phoenix. What a great little joint. Two baseball games, one football game, and soccer all at the same time, but they won't turn off the eighties music so you can hear the games... w/e Everybody greets each other, and are friendly to newcomers. Drinks ok - it's a bar, after all - and the short menu is classic bar food standards. But when the food comes out, it's way beyond standard. Sliders, burgers, sandwiches, all look great, and do not disappoint. The star for me was the hand-dipped onion rings - I don't like hand dipped. I like the grainy, frozen kind like you get at DQ... BUT now I can't say that anymore. These are crunchy, extra battered, and nom to the nom power.  Not for kids (it's a bar), but ironically, they do have a kids menu.  By the way, they caught the guy."}
{"text":"Karlas sports puts the \"F\" in FUN...its just F'n FUN! the staff is great! and the customers are awesome! lunch specials,happy hour specials,and a good vibe all around...job well done Karla!!!.P/s,im writing this review as i enjoy a cold modelo and some calamari with some friends."}
