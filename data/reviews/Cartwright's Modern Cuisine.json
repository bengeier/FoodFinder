{"text":"Executive Chef and co owner Brett Vibber breathes new life into Cartwright's up in Cave Creek. So my buddy is good friends with the new owner and chef of Cartwrights and convinced me to give them another chance. Went up with a group of friends to try it out and it was delicious! We all got The tasting menu, the chef prepared multiple courses of appetizers and entrées with wine pairings to match. From wagyu beef tartar with truffles, two stuffed quail, elk with bacon jam, house smoked cheeses, prawns, fresh line caught salmon and The list goes on and on it was an awesome deal! Definitely recommend trying it again if you have not already. They have a new purveyors, quality ingredients , and a passion for food! Check it out!"}
{"text":"We visited this steakhouse with a large group of about 18 adults; the service was very good, they managed us with two servers who did a good job of giving us suggestions on meals and cocktails. All items came out in a timely manner. Our meals were very appetizing; my wife got the 8oz beef tenderloin and I got the 12oz ribeye and both along with the sides were very good. As a starter though I got the bison chili, and wow, it was outstanding! I would definitely go back. I won't go into everyone's meal, but I think that everyone was happy. For dessert of the ones I tried: the inside-out carrot cake was good, the creme brûlée was average, the raspberry sorbet was very good and the banana coconut cream tart was excellent. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"There are a number of restaurants in the valley that try too hard to be southwestern. Cartwright's nails it without smacking you in the face with the decorations. As soon as you walk in you're transformed. Ever watch old episodes of Bonanza? Remember the ranch house? It's sort of that feeling.  Rustic, but classy.  The food and the service are both terrific. The servers are knowledgeable, friendly and more than happy to explain things.  They have an extensive menu and they even have gluten-free selections.  I don't come here often so I always order the same things. For an appetizer try the Red Chili Elk Balls (not only are they good but it's fun to say and no, they aren't really elk testicles). My go-to entree is the trio of tenderloin medallions: 3-oz each of beef, elk and bison buffalo.  How many opportunities do you have in life to have elk and bison buffalo? Don't let this opportunity pass you by.    Sadly I'm always too full when it comes time for dessert so you're on your own there.  I did notice that they have vegan and gluten-free dessert choices so if you're trying to appease your vegan friend that just watched you devour beef, elk and buffalo this might work out for you."}
{"text":"So disappointed. My clients recommend it and finally we tried it. Service was slow.  My steak came out over cooked and by the time they fixed it, I was over the whole experience. Bummer, I was hoping for great things."}
{"text":"Went to Cartwrights last weekend- we always forget about this place, don't get out that way much.  Such cute sonoran ambience, perfect place to take a date.  Food is really good, and the prices are very fair.  Our service was good too.  We will definitely keep it in our minds more!"}
{"text":"Enjoying Friday out for a steak during Bike week and had the pleasure of dining with the four mice that occupy the patio fireplace. The staff was stunned then entertained by the thought. Management didn't seem to care either. Disgusting"}
{"text":"My wife and I and a few of our closest friends ate at Cartwright's a few months ago and the meal was outstanding.  My wife enjoyed it so much that she requested to go back on her birthday with our best friends only to find out that the menu and decor has changed, unfortunately not for the best.  The only consistency are the relatively high prices ($39 for a little Elk, Buffalo and Beef).    The food was underwhelming if not forgettable.  The Caesar salad had so many random Southwestern infused ingredients that I am not sure it is a Caesar salad.  For the price point there are several other better options.  Needless to say we were disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Where did Cartwright's go? New menu? An over-verbalized attempt by a chef that doesn't know a ranch from an apartment building. Most of the reviews are pre new  menu. We were there on a weekend night and the place was dead. And let me tell you about happy hour. Their idea of a deal is to give you less than a half portion of less quality for half the price. Calamari rings the size of nickels and dimes in way too much breading and 2 (two) shrimp on the shrimp cocktail. We were going to have dinner but the preliminaries said it all. Even the help snickered at our displeasure of the changes. It is obvious why it isn't 3 deep at the bar like it used to be. I guess the owners can blame it on the economy. It wasn't broke. Bring back the abalone! Ranch House? Get Otta Dodge!"}
{"text":"Well.....just went last night hoping the new owner has wised up even though 'modern cuisine' in the western environment of Cave Creek seemed a long shot.  This place will never survive.  It has gone progressively down hill over the last 5 years....I live here!!  A real shame since I knew it as s great steak & seafood ranch house restaurant under previous owner.  Why change it?!  Service staff seem to be unhappy & of the caliber of Denny's or IHOP...not knowledgeable & the food is worse. Overpriced and decorative SMALL portions.  If I pay $30+ for salmon, I expect it to be the dominant item on the plate...not the unidentifiable vegetable & a heavy sauce!  Shame on me for wasting time & money giving this establishment a second & third chance! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I am that person who enjoys my meal cooked as I order it.  I was blown away by these people. My steak was perfect the potato hash brown was a huge hit.  My drink was never empty. What else can I say I'm sold and will be returning."}
{"text":"I gotta tell you, I want to like this place so badly I can't think straight. I live right down the street, so having a mid-upscale place to eat and drink within a mile from my house would be great...... Unfortunately, this place just sucks.... I have tried on four separate occasions and it seems to get worse each time.    The best thing I have had at this place is the beef stroganoff however, the last time I had it, it really disagreed with my stomach and my friend had it the same night and it put his stomach in knots as well. Weird. Anyway, I have tried the rib eye on a couple of occasions as well. This is a rib eye you would get at Sizzler. I'm not kidding, thin and tough as can be. I could go on and on about the lousy food I have had here but why? You get the message.  Anyone who gives this place 5 stars should have their Yelp account Yanked as they are costing unsuspecting diners thousands of dollars. For those of you who are looking at this review, I can help you decide whether or not to go here very simply:  If you like Sizzler, you will love this place. If you like strange sides trying hard to be exotic Top Chef fare that taste strange, you'll love this place. If you like paying high end restaurant prices for  very mediocre food, you'll love this place.  If you want a great meal, great service and atmosphere and you are ready to spend the money, go down to Mastros Ocean Club or even Capital Grille. The only reason to ever go into Cartwrights is that bartender Jan. She is great and makes great drinks.  PS: To Cartwrights,  Why is everyone trying so hard to be creative and innovative? Keep if simple. Serve great cuts of meat, simple sides made with the best ingredients and for gods sake, make sure the servers are good. The rest will take care of itself. Leave the creativity and originality to the James Beard award winners."}
{"text":"Went last night as this is one of our favorite restaurants when we are in town and was so very disappointed. The decor has changed and is more casual and open compared to intimate. That being said we were talking up the food to our friends as it was their first visit..... Well I really hope it was just a bad day for the chef as three of us ordered the Halibut (which we have had before) and all three dishes came out dry. So they did the dishes over again and believe it or not two out of the three came out dry again !! The fourth person had the bone in rib-eye and as usual it was cooked to perfection. I really hope this was just a one off experience as this is our go to favorite in the area and we will give it one more try (without the guests !!) Deserts were awesome and the wine selection as mentioned in another post is a solid list with some good price points."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal here.  Great food with outstanding service.  Nice ambiance with a western twist. that ties in nicely with Cave Creek.  One of our favorite restaurants in the whole area.  If you like meat, this is the place to go.  I almost always get the rib eye, which is hard to beat here, and always perfectly cooked to the medium rare I prefer."}
{"text":"I am not sure why they felt a menu change was needed.   I was shocked to see no wait for a table on Friday night at 6pm.  Last year on this same weekend I would not have gotten in with out a reservation.  The food was still good but the soul of this place had been ripped out.  The waiter touted that they were a steakhouse but the menu was mostly seafood.  There was only three steak choices left on the menu.  Everything on the menu looked liked the tried hard to be exotic.   But the execution was wrong and does not fit a steak house.  Bring back the old menu and stop being cheap.  I paid for upscale but instead got some chilis's chain store creation and taste.   If they don't get it figured out soon, I don't see how they will stay in business."}
{"text":"No way, I get to bust the cherry with the first review! Phoenix Yelpers, hello???  The scenery rocks from the patio. Intimate wine room for a happening get together. Cool bar when you first come in the door. The dining room is open with a fire pit in the middle. There are way too many places trying to be Scottsdale or the New Sedona, but this place keeps its Southwestern roots.   Dishes that rock the house. Lobster tortilla soup with cilantro creme, yowza! Try something different with your nachos, pan roasted ahi & crab with white cheese and mango salsa. The chili lime pork tenderloin is another fave, with sun dried fruit salsa and green chili mac & cheese that kinda screwed up my world. Why have plain jane when you can have her hot cousin Lupe?"}
{"text":"Great upscale rustic vibe.  Table bread among the best we've ever had - challenge is not to fill up on it.  We played it safe with steaks but they were prepared perfectly to our order and were priced reasonably.  The scalloped potatoes are the best side - ask to switch if they're not suggested with your entrée.  Coconut tart and choc/van/salty caramel gelato a great way to finish.  Wine list decent but much better by the bottle than the glass.  Well made martinis and whiskey sours got us started.  Julie from England a great waitress and service was outstanding.  Go there."}
{"text":"Should be called CartWrongs. Not a thing went right. The food was horrible. Wouldn't feed it to my dog. The specialty drink the waitress brought me was horrible. I honestly have not ate at a place this bad in years, I couldn't fathom anyone who actually comes back to this place. There were 6 of us, 6 different plates, not a single one was even decent."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding meal here with the elk steak.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The beet salad is out of this world ( my gf, who split the salad with me and doesn't like beets, loved it).  Everything here was top notch from the bread on the table to the mixed drinks.  This a world class steak/seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the luxury of eating here over the past weekend and what a treat. I had the 8 oz. filet (with the blue cheese on top) and my wife had the 6 oz. Both excellent! Side dishes (starch/veggie) were solid! We ordered the house wine (recommended) and also cheaper by the glass than other featured items.  Also, I am thrilled to see some of the newer restaurants coming to the area. Having lived in Carefree for almost 15 years...seeing it start to boom in addition to offering restaurants with flavor instead of simply Western decor really is nice.    Waiter was extremely informative. I even joked that he could of probably been a voice over in some animated movie or tv commercial.   Anyhow, thanks for a great night out. We plan on coming back next time we visit...can't wait to try the seafood."}
{"text":"I must update my previous review. The atmosphere here is outstanding, but the food quality and preparation has gone down. You don't get as much food and they have changed the menu in an unfavorable way. I hope to take a look at the direction they are going."}
{"text":"We have been going to cartwrights since 2007 and the first time we went we were immediately impressed. So much so that this restaurant emerged as one of our favorites. The varied eclectic menu was superb!  We went there for our 40th anniversary last August and had one of our favorite meals ever.   Then calamity struck.  We went there again three nights ago and were surprised to see a new and disappointing menu, where it took us 20 minutes to settle on dinner entry choices. We settled on the Caesar salad with scallops and the Mac and cheese with quail. The server suggested the latter as her favorite item on the menu. The salad was drowning in dressing and the Mac and cheese tasted as if it came out of a box. The service was a fraction of the quality we were used to from all of our previous visits.   Needles to say, cartwrights has been removed from our list of favorite restaurants and we will not be returning. The old adage comes to mind based on our recent experience --  \"If it aint broke, don't fix it.\""}
{"text":"This is just a fabulous place!  Beautiful. So Cave Creek! Gorgeous. Western and classy at the same time. I had the filet with bernaise AND bleu cheese...just deadent! My husband had the prime rib with fresh asparagus and a giant baked potato. This is a real steak house! wine and beer list were superb and service was wonderful. will go back!"}
{"text":"For those who have been going here, heads up, the menu has changed and the ingredients for some of the old favorites are different.   We ordered the shrimp appetizer for $12 and out came only four small shrimp.  We were disappointed in the menu change and the portions appear to be smaller for more $$.  One person in our party commented that it \"felt like we were in a French restaurant\" with the little portions and high prices.  I did not notice, but others commented that the tables looked different as well.  My chicken Jadori was delicious, but again very small...only a leg and part of a thigh.  We probably will not be going back again as there are better values out there..."}
{"text":"Went with the family for thanksgiving dinner.  It was very good.  I imagine you can't go wrong at cartwrights    I've not been here before. But I will certainly return. They are a steakhouse and I don't eat beef or other large mammals.  But I will give it a shot and try their seafood.  Great service, tasty.   Good choice for thanksgiving.  $400 but not bad for four people with a couple drinks and a bottle of wine. If you visit Cave Creek and want a good dinner in a really neat place I certainly recommend it.  But here's the thing that irritated me.   And I guess maybe this is a holiday thing.  I don't mind when I have a large group at a restaurant and they add the 18% tip in the bill  Lets say 8 people or more   I get it.  But four people?  Seriously?  I always tip minimum 20%.  But if you tell me to tip 18, then that's what you get. Two couples shouldn't have the auto tip   I realize some people are cheap pricks who do 10 or whatever  but I do 20. So you dick your server. Again great food and atmosphere   But that add on tip chapped my ass  again maybe it was just the holiday, but I can take  $340 and do the math  four stars for the meal. Minus one star for unsportsmanlike conduct"}
{"text":"Food good service sucked. Waiter thought he was European and was pretentious as hell"}
{"text":"Nothing but amazing!!!!! Try the elk oscar style, heaven on a plate!!"}
{"text":"Used to be great, however, they changed the menu and now it is horrible.  We ate dinner there shortly after they changed and it was awful so we decided to give them time to get themselves together as we figured it must be due to the transition.  Wrong!  Have eaten there twice since and still horrible.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't know what's happened to this former high quality restaurant but it isn't good.   Service was great as usual but food wasn't even mediocre. Steaks were tasteless, tuff and over cooked; vegetables tough as shoe leather and pasta tasteless as well.   New owner, manager, chief?"}
{"text":"Trout was delicious as well as the local made honey lavender huckleberry ice cream You must come by and try them out!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this restaurant. I had been planning this trip since I first arrived in Phoenix. When I got there I was really impressed with the decor. My boyfriend ordered an herb crusted chicken breast however we were NOT impressed with the meal at all. It was so dry that he could not even cut it with his knife! My meal in the other hand was not as bad however the meat was very fatty(I had ordered the 'Trio of meats Elk, Beef & Buffalo') and undercooked. So maybe we went on a bad night but I was truly heart broken because I had expected much more than what I got."}
{"text":"I love this place for \"date night\". I recommend a reservation on weekends. It has great live bands and a wonderful menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, our servers name was Blake who provided us with superb service.  I ordered the bone in ribeye Pittsburgh style which chef Brett cooked to perfection. Will highly recommend Cartwright's and will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Took some out of town guests to Cartwright's for dinner. Hubby and I had celebrated New Year's Eve there and the food was dynamite. Service was a bit impersonal but I wrote it off as probably due to the holiday crowd. So when we returned 6 weeks later with our guests we expected to have a good meal and possibly more attentive service. We were sorely disappointed on both counts. The food actually tasted like hospital food with no seasoning, no flavor. The server took our drink orders and returned a few minutes later to take our meal orders. Little dialogue. A busboy brought our meals to the table and we didn't see our server again until it was time for the check. Too many other great restaurants in the area to settle for tasteless, mediocre food and robot like servers. Will not go back and will never recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dinner date with the wife and of coarse we sat at the bar. The 2 tenders worked good with each other and 1 hell of a cable car (Las Vegas Bellagio Style) Dinner was excellent and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Wow!   Cartwrights has switched their menu to include more southwest options.  Love the new menu & the food was amazing!  I devoured my Molasses covered pork shoulder.  My husband described his chorizo stuffed quail on a bed of gouda Mac & cheese as \"frigging fantastic\"!  Can't wait to go back & try the duck & peach appetizer!"}
{"text":"We were told by our restate lady to go here before hitting the highway at 5pm. We started out at the bar with cocktails and carlamari and both were out of this world. Then we got a table for dinner...the cowboy ribeye was just awsome cooked to perfection med rare my wife ordered the triple 3oz protein plate and it was cooked to perfection.  If you wat a super great meal and great service Carwrights is for you"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. My wife had the shrimp cocktail, the shrimp were good sized and well cooked with a horseradish tomato sauce. Nothing special but definitely nothing wrong with it.  I had elk chile balls.  These were an excellent set of three meatballs with a terrific chile sauce that made me want to lick the plate.  For entree we had beef tenderloin stroganoff and rainbow trout respectively. The stroganoff was cooked with peppers that added a nice bonus touch to a well done traditional dish. The trout was fresh, nicely filleted and grilled.    Service was attentive and friendly without being invasive. Cartwrights    Is a big place and was busy, as in full,  on Friday night but we never felt rushed or like the staff was stretched.   It's a bit noisy but even though I have trouble with my hearing I wad able to hear and converse just fine.  Cartwrites is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new menu and decor! I'm all for change as long as it's for the better, but this is not a good change at all.    This used to be my favorite restaurant and I was always so excited to take people here and recommend Cartwright's, but can no longer do so with the new menu and the large increase in prices. For example, the old menu included 6 blue point oysters for $8 and now they are $14! The steaks and fish used to be phenomenal when you could choose the type of steak or fish and the sauce and sides, but not any longer. Now you have a choice between two types of fish (trout, salmon) and scallops for the seafood choices with sauces and sides already chosen for you. Good ole' mashed potatoes...out of luck...unless you like jack cheese in your mashed potatoes.... Baked potato...out of luck again...they don't have any.... This is not the same place it used to be, and sadly it's not for the best with the recent changes.  Pros: 1. The sewer has been moved from the front of the restaurant so it no longer stinks upon entering and exiting the restaurant. 2. Waitress allowed us to strip down all of our orders to basic steak (without the predetermined sauces) and swap sides.  Cons: 1. New limited menu (i.e. only a few steak and fish entrees with already chosen sauces and sides) 2. Large increase in price 3. Bread basket has gone way down hill; only one type of bread now. No longer includes yummy corn muffins. 4. Watered down alcoholic beverages 5. Decor - the white table cloths used to be a nice touch and made it a rustic elegant and romantic place. The new wood tables from reclaimed box cars are nice; however, it gives off a much more casual vibe."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner was a bust. Old owners ruined the night.   After new owners I am 100% happy and the best happy hour in town. I visit now on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"This was my family's second year in a row at Cartwright's for Thanksgiving and it was very good again.  I rated it 4 stars this time instead of 5 for a few reasons.  Since we had a specific Thanksgiving menu I can't really compare to all the complaints I have since read here but I can understand most of them.  Not serving a baked potatoe in a steakhouse is pretty ridiculous and two in my party were disappointed with that.  Also, last year they had the most fantastic pumpkin puree appetizer and this year there was something wrong with it - sort of bitter.  The mashed potatoes may be Idahoan instants out of the package.  This year an alternate entree choice was salmon, and my husband's was perfect.  Another choice (last year's was prime rib) was sirloin steak and two were served over-cooked but they instantly replaced them with ones cooked perfect.   The side dish with that was a skillet of diced roasted potatoes and veggies that seemed to me like something from Denny's.  I have to send cudos to our server, Julie; she handled our party of six perfectly and was charming and funny.  So, yeah, I'm still a fan but if this place is under new management and they're trying to squeeze more profit out of it, they better figure out this isn't the way to do it, or Cartwright's won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"Provides solid efforts in both steaks and seafood, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cartwright's use to be a great restaurant, but the restaurant has been going gradually downhill, and pulled the ultimate profit scam this past Christmas Eve, I.e., substituted a horrible fixed menu at a ridiculously high price.  This was done with no warning when reservations were made; the bottom line to our family of four dinner is we paid $125 more than any previous of our ten Christmas Eve dinners.  Total Ripoff!!!  As a ten year regular customer, we just went back, and again the food was no where near what we had come to expect.  Strongly suggest moving on!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for an upscale dinner in cave creek.  Last year the restaurant went through a redo.  The menu has completely changed and gone are the tablecloths.    If you are expecting the Cartwrights you are used to, do not go here.  If you are looking for just a restaurant, then it will be fine."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Probably one of the best times you will find in Cave Creek. A must visit. Red Chili-Dusted Scallops.... Pow! Bam! Wham! Zap! Boom! Will knock the socks off your trigger finger pilgrim."}
{"text":"We had our \"pre-anniversary\" dinner there last night. We both ordered the Trio of Tenderloin Medallions, how could be resist? Elk, buffalo and beef. My beef, although good, was the least tender of the three, but I can forgive that because the elk and  buffalo were Ahhh- mazing! The sweet potato hash was a great accompaniment. Shared the S'more in a mason jar for desert. A perfect ending. Loved the ambience and the service was great.  In fact, our server got busy with a large table and we were ready to order our desert, so another server who was passing by took our order; we were very impressed!  First time here, but can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Top shelf range meat and service in a casual environment! Elk, Bison, Beef."}
{"text":"Rode the bikes up to Cave Creek on a Friday night with high hopes for Cartwright's based on some Yelp reviews but mostly on the menu and pictures from their website. The pictures were accurate--the ambience of the place is pretty cool. Unfortunately, the ambience is writing checks the food and service can't cash.   Even though the place was pretty empty (warning sign?) we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was a nice kid, but obviously not trained to deliver the service you expect at a place with these prices. Dirty glasses from the previous guests sat uncleared at our spot until I moved them down onto the bar. Had to ask to have dirty plates removed and clean ones for the next course (2 of us were sharing everything.) A patron a few bar stools down asked if the bartender could make her a lemon drop drink. He couldn't. Didn't know what it was. Huh?   We ordered the Elk meatballs, chorizo-stuffed quail and ahi tuna. The Elk meatballs and quail were good--not great. Extra credit for the innovativeness in stuffing the qual with chorizo and the mac-n-cheese base was good. Things went from good to below average with the ahi tuna--in part because an entree priced at $42 is automatically setting a high bar for quality. If the ahi was once sushi-grade as listed in the menu, it was unrecognizable as such by the time it was overcooked and put on the plate. When the plate was set down and the first bite was in...I immediately thought, \"you are getting what you deserve for ordering fish in the desert.\"   Can't comment on the quality of the steaks, but based on this experience and knowing how awesome some of the steakhouses in Phoenix are--I'd discourage anyone from making this drive in anticipation of an outstanding meal. Sad, because it's got a lot of potential to be much better."}
{"text":"Cartwright's Modern Cuisine is the definition of elite! It offers excellent ambiance, service, and OMG! food! We had the tasting menu - this is the way to go to try Chef Brett's wonderful creations. From sushi to elk steak all was mouth watering. My personal favorite courses were the beef tataki and the Elk steak it was sooooo good! Thank you, Brett for your amazing hospitality and excellent dishes!"}
{"text":"I made reservations and took a friend to Cartwright's for Thanksgiving dinner.  They had 3 choices on the menu for the event. 1. Traditional Thanksgiving dinner. 2. Filet and 3. Salmon Since I had made a turkey dinner the night before I chose the filet and my friend had the salmon. The meal started with soup and salad. The salad had crab and watercress and was really good. The soup was also very good. The filet was cooked to perfection and so tender it melted in my mouth like butter. They served the filet with potatoes and asparagus.  My friend ordered the salmon and said it was the best salmon she had ever eaten. She let me try some and it was very moist and delicious! I topped off my meal with one of their craft beers on tap that was suggested by the server.  It really added to the meal in a positive way. The service here was over the top, everyone was really nice and right on time with everything.  Overall I was really happy with the meal and look forward to returning here to try one of their steaks."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was awesome, I had the Steak trio and it was cooked to perfection. Also our server was really nice and informative. I had the deconstructed berry cobbler and omg it was heaven. Will def come back"}
{"text":"We have been here several times with family and for the romantic dinner for two and found both experiences outstanding.  In Scottsdale we often forego inflated pricing for a sub par dining experience not so here.  While you will certainly pay top prices you will also get what you pay for.  Delicious steaks, sea food and interesting appetizers.  Did I say delicious I meant it!  Without doubt one of the best ribeye steak dinners in the valley cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor and you can choose from 3 or 4 different topping schemes depending on your mood.  Fantastic decor great service need I say more.  If your in Cave Creek looking for a great meal search no further than Cartwrights."}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTING!!!  Cartwright's was our favorite restaurant for special occasions and just for a nice evening out.  Last May we had  our daughter's in town and enjoyed the usual fantastic experience.  In November we returned looking forward to a wonderful dinner and couldn't believe how bad it was!!!  We even asked if there had been  a change of ownership, chef etc. but received NO to all our inquiries.  The menu is so unbelievably weird that the Chef must have been high on something when he composed it and tried to put the most unusual combination of ingredients into each and every item!  It took us forever to decide what to order!!!  I finally had the Turquoise Salad - ok and we shared a ribeye.  We specifically asked for unseasoned steak so the flavor is not disguised.  However, when it came we could tell it had been marinated and covered with black pepper that had been scraped off to satisfy us  without recooking the steak. The server said \"all their steaks are marinated\" --- a bad sign of cheaper cuts!    The service was spotty as the waiter flew by and occasionally stopped by.  I noticed an adjoining table of 6 were also as disappointed as we were in the service and the food. WHAT HAPPENED CARTWRIGHT'S!?!?!?!?!  PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLDER WONDERFUL WAYS -- the place was impossible to get into to and now I doubt that's a problem.  We know FOR SURE WE WON'T BE RETURNING and friends of ours have said the same thing ----- SO VERY SAD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a special occasion. It's nice, but not great. We got sat in the back room (musty smell that kind of put me off my food) -- the main room looked a little warmer. Server was great - very attentive. Bread was cold. Limited vegetarian options and wine list was so-so. Definitely has the Cave Creek charm though. If we go back, I would probably sit at the bar which looked a little more lively."}
{"text":"Good was amazing. Little on the pricey side, but get plenty for your buck. Service and ambiance were great too. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last Sat. with good friends we frequently dine-with.  We've always liked this place, the ambience and casual atmosphere.  Much surprised to see a new menu (been away too long apparently).  The meal: Wait person made a big deal about tips and drinks are not included in Restaurant Week promo.  We weren't there for that reason, never mentioned it.  My wife asked for horseradish to accompany her fillet, was told \" I'll check with the Chef, I think we took it off the menu.\"  Say what?   Our nothing-special meals were served, and within minutes of having desert our checks were presented.  Problem: We never asked for them, and the server took the liberty to assigned orders to separate checks without being asked to do so.  We normally split the check.  Overall the price paid for food and drinks was high.  Might go back, but not for a while.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I think the food is fantastic and the service is excellent. The ambiance is cowboy meets elegance and the food is thoughtful and extremely tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone! I love their spin on chips and salsa, and I recommend their fish and steak. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in our meal last night. My wife and I haven't been to Cartwright's in a while...now I know why. First of all, the atmosphere was poor...very bright lighting- had to ask our server (who was very friendly) to turn down the hospital lighting. Then the food - ugh. The tortilla soup was incredibly bland. Thank goodness there was salt/pepper on the table. My 8 oz filet which I ordered med rare was extremely over-cooked. I would have returned it, but I was crazy hungry after waiting 45 min for the food to come out. The server never came to check on us so, I would have eaten my shoe at that point - which is what this cut of beef tasted like. The best thing about our meal was my Woodford Reserve Manhattan. Skip this place unless you lose a bet...so many better steak joints in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually come here on date night but today we brought our daughter because there were fireworks later in the evening.  We absolutely love this place and the food is always delicious!! Our waitress was very attentive  her name was Mary K, do ask for her section the service was great!!  My all time favorite is the banana cream tart for dessert"}
{"text":"EASILY the Beat food and cocktails in CaveCreek/Carefree area. Modern Ranch menu with a fun and flavorful twist on the classics.   Try the Pierogi and Kielbasa dinner if you want your tastebuds to thank you. And, Save from for dessert."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times in the past year and have never been disappointed.  The decor is \"upscale Cave Creek\"; don't feel like you need to wear a tie. You wouldn't stand out if you wore jeans as long as they aren't the same jeans you wear to wash the car.  They have an incredible menu.  A wide selection of salads and appetizers. You have to try the Sonoran Sausage; it has elk, beef and buffalo in it - where else are you going to get a sausage like that? Oh and it's very good.  Salads and appetizers are in the $8 to $12 range.  The entrees should satisfy any taste.  They have pork dishes, chicken, and your choice of about seven kinds of fish prepared the way you'd like it - pick Asian, Mediterranean, European or Sonoran.  The big draw here are the steaks and game.  They come with sides included.  Elk, beef, buffalo and lamb (or a combination of them) are on the menu.  You get to pick a starch (potatoes, rice, mac and cheese), pick a sauce and pick a veggie.   The staff is attentive and knowledgeable.   They know their menu and are happy to answer any question. They'll even offer advice if asked."}
{"text":"Great place to have Southwest food in Cave Creek, AZ.   They recently redid their menus. Great beer draft selection and I had the Pirogues with Sausage.  Very friendly atmosphere and serves very.  \"Highly Recommend!\""}
{"text":"Appearance:  4.5 stars.  Old Scottsdale decor that does not take itself too seriously.  Cool bar, comfortable dining room.  Service: 5 stars.  Excellent host staff seated us before our reservation.  Very busy Saturday but we had water and bread within 2 minutes of seating done, and server arrived within 5 minutes.  Service was excellent--thorough knowledge of menu, very attentive but not intrusive.  Beverages:  4.5 stars.  Awesome margarita set apart from the crowd by inclusion of jalapeño and homemade simple syrup!   Interesting cocktail menu.  Food:  4.5 stars.  Won-ton appetizer with blue crab and cheese was a bit overdone but tasty.  Grilled pear salad was amazing, and ribeye steak was excellent and perfectly prepared.  Had Cowboy S'more for dessert, and loved the idea, but execution was a bit lacking as the chocolate ganache was overpowering compared to the relatively small amount of marshmallow (cooked at your table!), and use of graham cracker crust instead of actual graham cracker lost a much needed crunchy element to the dessert .    Overall: 4.5 stars.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The chef is hands down amazing. From service to main dish to pastries it was excellent. Ordered a mojito which was amazing, infused with prickly pear cactus juice. They also had other craft cocktails & a wide selection of draft beer. Personally i ordered the quail mac & cheese which was outstanding. Between the delicate meat and cheesy noodles my taste buds were very pleased. My mother ordered the stroganoff which she had ordered almost 10 years ago. She said it was the same delicious flavor she remembered. We saved room for desserts, which i would recommend for EVERYONE. Three meals, two desserts, and two alcoholic beverages later the tab was $80. Not too bad!"}
{"text":"A late lunch and a table for 10 was all we asked.  We sat down at 4:10p in the Wine room next to a nice fireplace.. Mary Louise was prompt, explained the menu in detail, answered questions knowledgeably, and took drink orders (with out for the Cowboy..).  She returned to more questions, and patiently answered all. The calamari  started the day - no \"spiders\" here - luscious strips of moist squid and a slightly spicy sauce.. yum.  Specialty of the house was a 3-oz trio of beef, venison, and bison - a little rare for one of us, but the rest were delighted.  The bison burger was a delight.  Altogether, a fun, relaxing atmosphere with great food and beverages.  Oh, yes, the deconstructed blueberry pie was superb."}
{"text":"The ambiance was a nice surprise.  I do not enjoy the cheesy not-real \"southwestern\" look sometimes found in Cave Creek and this place did NOT use it.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by the decor.  I chose it because I had hoped my carnivore husband would enjoy it and I would have some type of salad .... then I was told about their gluten free and veggie menus.  Big Smile!  That was another big surprise.  Since it is a Steakhouse, I will tell you that my husband really enjoyed it.  As a veggie, I was happy to find a clever dish that wasn't just a salad, baked potato or steamed vegetables.  It was surprisingly well done and creative.  We both really enjoyed dinner and wine."}
{"text":"Cartwrights has been our \"go to\" restaurant for a long time.  My wife and I were excited to see the recent remodel of the bar area. It now has additional table seating in the bar which exudes a rustic & casual elegance. A collection of sepia photographs of the famous Cartwrights ranch north of Cave Creek shares a historic visual of their origin.  We have found the servers to be consistently friendly and knowledgeable about their menu and wine list. The old uniforms have been replaced with western shirts and jeans which add to the comfortable \"ranch\" atmosphere.  The remodel of the bar provided a much needed addition of draft beer. There are about 10 great craft beers including regional as well as local gems.  The bottle program has been expanded too.  (They also have an amazing root beer on tap.)  The menu has changed, but I have not tried all of the new items. I can say their Mac & Cheese with Quail may be the best I have had. There is a medley of cheeses and the smoked gouda provides the predominant flavor. This dish is memorable!  Raised in the mid-west, I LOVE red meat.  The beef tenderloin cooked medium rare is as good as you will find in the valley.  I plan on trying the trio of elk, bison & beef next time we go in. Their ribeye could be the gold standard of beef in the valley. A New York strip has been added to the menu, but I have yet to try it.  The desert menu has also been updated, but I have only tried the lava-carrot cake served with a sassafras ice cream (that is made in house), because it was so good, i have had it each time we have been in....there are a couple of others that deserve a taste.  The Cartwright's experience has been stepped up a notch and can now be enjoyed for LUNCH as well as dinner.  I'd recommend Cartwrights all day long."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and both times have been great! The service and food are both top notch.  I got the bone in ribeye my wife got the New York strip, both were cooked perfectly. The sides and sauce options are all very good. A little pricey but expected in Cave Creek, well worth the drive."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary dinner here and it was our first visit.  The service, atmosphere and food were excellent.  We had the salmon and pork chop.  They were cooked to perfection!   We were very pleased with experience and cannot wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"Cartwright's serves up a great meal.  Is it the best I have ever had for the price?  No.  The environment is what I would call upscale cowboy.  Maybe even refined rustic.  It is a good spot in the Carefree/Cave Creek area.  There is a nice bar with a surprisingly decent bourbon selection.  Many of the wines that they carry are noteworthy too.    We had a good meal.  My husband ordered the NY strip and I had the filet.  Both were cooked well and presented well, but for the price, we feel that we have had much better meals elsewhere.  The carrot cake dessert was good...but didn't live up to the hype.  I guess that is the drawback for us...the menu has great verbiage to describe the food, but we just felt that it wasn't all that it was illustrated to be with the price that was attached.  No gripes about the service.  Our waitress was great. This is a place that we are glad that we tried, but it isn't necessarily on our \"must go again\" list.  If we did go back, I would be inclined to stick with a burger and beer at the bar."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I've been to Cartwright's and it really seems like they've stepped up their game.  The drink menu is creative and interesting and I like that they've combined entrees and sides.  My scallops were absolutely delish and desserts were fantastic."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!! Our first time there last night. Mary Kay was our server and she was just a delight. We ordered two burgers. One regular and one with jalapeños. The food was simply to die for! My wife and I are big fans. We decided on having our event there in September. Thank you and please keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Let's say it's 4 stars if you're not paying for it, 1.5 or 2 stars if you are. Nice old-west vibe and character throughout. Menu looks great with traditional and progressive dishes but they're venturing out toward asian and even sushi. I can't speak to the sushi per se, but I did have the ($16) tuna tartare which was uncharacteristically tasteless, so I'm not sure I'd recommend the adventurous dishes. My party seemed generally satisfied with their food, and 'generally satisfying' it was: I had a strip steak (which I almost never get since I can cook a great steak myself, but this seemed like the place to do it). I myself would not spend $60+pp on 'generally satisfying,' but my family picked up the bill so if they invited me back, I'd certainly take them up on it!"}
{"text":"Took my hubby here for a birthday dinner. He was a happy camper! As others have mentioned and I certainly agree that this place has great atmosphere and character. Like an upscale ranch house. I felt comfortable as soon as I walked in. We arrived early so we could check out the bar for cocktails. He had a couple of single malt scotches. The 12 year Macallan and the Dalwhinnie which they served with a cool looking large slow melting ice sphere (not small cubes that would dilute). He thoroughly enjoyed them. Dinner started with a basket of homemade bread goods. I think there was a bread with garlic top, cheese scone and corn muffins. Hard to recall since we gobbled them all up so quickly.  We started with the Indian Buffalo sausage and the Blue Point oysters. The sausage was fork licking tasty and the oysters were fresh and briny. We shared an Arizona Field Greens/Arugula/beets salad. Loved the earthy red beets, the light golden beets and the homemade pickles in the salad. Very light yet full of flavor. My husband had the rib eye. Perfectly done and melt in your mouth good. I had the Double cut  Colorado lamb chops. Oh, they were perfect. Only, second to the lamb I had in New Zealand. The plates come with a starch and veggies which were also great. My hubby finished with a Hopf Dunkle Weise Hefe Weizen and I finished with the Cowboy S'mores. Super rich, decadent and novel. I just was hoping to put it together myself but the homemade graham cookie was in the warm chocolate ganache. Just a thought for the future (hint, hint).  We left with full tummies and big smiles. Can barely wait to go back and try more great food!"}
{"text":"Cartwright's has great steak. The sides are what let me down. There is nothing sweet or glazed about the baby carrots. Baked potato was a nice size, but was a little underdone. The roasted tomato soup was more like Puréed tomatoes.  Go for the steak - hold everything else."}
{"text":"Cartwright's has redeemed itself! The hubs & I decided to give it another go after none of our usual Cave Creek/Carefree haunts held our interests that night. Unlike last time we avoided the steaks, but the hubs had fish & I had the prime rib. Everything was excellent. The service, which was never the issue in the first place, was absolutely top notch, and the waiter brought me several samples of wine when I couldn't decide which I wanted. Tip: This is a great way to get the equivalent of a free glass of wine ; )  Speaking of wine, they have wine tasting classes several times a month. We'll be adding this back into our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I can't believe we have lived in Scottsdale for 30 years and never found Cartwright's. We go to Cave Creek often but never knew about the place until today.  Our waitress was Denise , and - because this is July - she had plenty of time to tell us what is going on there. She pointed out the old parts of the original ranch house and gave a little history of the place.  My wife and I are on a high protein/low carb program. She had a ribeye and i had the \"triple play\" - which is 3  three ounce3 tenderloins of beef, elk & buffalo.   OUTSTANDING!!  We also had sauteed spinach and asparagus and finished it all.  The restaurant makes a big deal about organic and local stuff. I don't care about that. But what I want anyone who reads this to know is that you will have a great experience there."}
{"text":"I was expecting a great meal from Cartwright's because I love the food from Tonto, which is the sister restaurant. Unfortunately it was overall disappointing which is too bad, because the atmosphere is cozy and nice and the service was good. The (relatively) new vegetarian-friendly menu is what drew me in but it wasn't anything too exciting - salads from the main menu, a few unexciting appetizers, and two entree choices (an assortment of vegetable sides or vegetarian chili).   I ordered the $15 vegetarian chili and was so disappointed in what was served - beans and vegetables in a thin broth and the whole thing had a sour taste to it. I want my chili to be thick and comforting, and this dish had none of those qualities. My husband ordered the pork shoulder/chorizo and liked the meat portion of his dish but didn't care for any of the sides.   I'll be sticking with Tonto when looking for a good upscale meal in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Went there for a Thanksgiving celebration. There was plenty of food and four courses to the dinner. The food seemed pretty worn out for lack of a better word. The turkey was shredded into string like strands and the side dishes were very watery. I guess I shouldn't expect much from AZ dining but for $160.00 excluding drinks I expected much better. On the plus side service was excellent and the atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This place is trying to be something its not in a place it's not. We were hoping for just a good steak and potato place in a small western setting town and got a foo-foo place that thinks it's downtown NY, with prices to match. $36 per person is the lower 25% side of the menu. Although the flavor was excellent, the delivery fell quite short. The augratin potatoes were soupy (had to request a spoon) and lacked cheese atop and in the sauce, not sure if the equivalent of 1/2 a potato, there were maybe 4 thinly shave brussel sprouts, and it wasn't until partially through our steaks (we ordered same dish) that we realized the server  swapped the order.    For $72 for 2 10 oz. steaks,  2 substandard orders of augratin potatoes (1 potato maybe), 8 brussel sprouts, and plates delivered to table wrong, I'd say save your money and find an Outback or Texas Roadhouse.  Better yet, go across the street to Buffalo Chip and BOTH eat 3 meals of BBQ brisket wirh friendlier service."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 for dinner. All of our meals were prepared exactly right. Several of us had the Trio of Elk, Bison and Beef...wonderful!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Took my family of 4 there.  I had the beef tenderloin, elk tenderloin and bison tenderloin trio.  It's a dish they are known for.  I'm not one for wild game, but I sure like steaks, so I wanted to live on the edge and try something different.  No regrets.  It was fantastic.  Not gamey what-so-ever.  Also got the elk balls as an appetizer.  Don't worry, they aren't elk testicles, but rather ground up elk MEAT balls.  There were three and they were drizzled with a chipole sauce that was to die for.  My 9-year-old had the salmon and he raved about it!  My wife enjoyed hers too, but for the life of me, I can't remember what she had.  The specialty drinks were fantastic, but a bit pricey.  This was our splurge dinner and for the four of us, with two appetizers, three adult beverages, three adult entrees and a kids burger, it was just over $250 with tip.  Would certainly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of my wife and my fave's in AZ.  Hand's down a great Arizona dining experience -- food, service, location.  I just took my mom for her bday.  The waitress mis-heard her order for sparkling water and brought sparkling wine.  I mentioned she just wanted bubbly water, she smiled, said no problem and came right back with the water.    The entrees are just wonderful, love the imagination of the chef and the spices.  Always fresh new ideas on the menu too.  If in Phx/Scottsdale area and looking for a special meal, consider Cartwrights."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple of weeks ago and really liked it. Here's the quick and dirty...  Parking -- free parking in the adjacent lot  Food -- very good! I was in a party of 7 and everyone liked what they ordered. We had two kinds of tortilla chips with a fantastic chipotle salsa-- we actually bought an extra order to take home; a green salsa -- also excellent; and avocado dip similar to guacamole. I ordered a burger which was huge (8 oz) and very good and a side salad which came tossed in their house honey vinagrette which was also very good. It was too much for me to eat but everything was cooked perfectly.   They also have game on their menu like the elk/buffalo burger and elk meatballs along with traditional steak, chicken, and pasta dishes.  One of the highlights is dessert. We tried their 'famous' s'more in a jark which is a jar that's heated with layers of chocolate, marshmallow and house-made graham cracker cake. Excellent. Can see why it's a favorite.  Ambiance-- intimate and rustic. The restaurant is huge so there are actually four sections to sit in including the bar area which is right when you walk in. Great for large parties. Decor is what you would expect-- Arizona wild west theme but tasteful and not overly exaggerated.  Service -- very good. No complaints.  Prices-- reasonable. Expect to pay about $20 - $40 per person for an entree, more for a drink, salad, appetizer, and dessert.  Holidays-- I looked at what they were offering for a Thanksgiving special and it looked good. Prices are comparable with others of that caliber."}
{"text":"I usually don't visit steakhouses, no, I am not a vegetarian, I just don't eat beef very often.  I came here for a birthday and it was also Restaurant Week.  The menu for restaurant week was delicious, I liked it even better than the regular one.  We started with a cocktail, I wanted a Moscow Mule, I think they just started making them, because our server had to go check if they could make it.  It was good, not as awesome as other ones I have had.  The bread is made in house, so even though I try to avoid breads, I had to try it, twice.  It was so carbtastically delicious.   I started with the shrimp cocktail, wow, the cocktail sauce had a lot of horseradish, really spicy, but I could handle it.  For my entree, I had the salmon, it was cooked to perfection and for dessert I had the Tres Leches, I had to really had a lot of self control to not finish every bite.  I took half of the cake for my hubby.  I think I need to come back for another experience, it is a great place."}
{"text":"A Thanksgiving \"dont\".  A total turkey.   We were looking forward to a nice meal with our adult children and grandchild.  We were offered a selection of salmon, turkey, and beef, which came with appetizers, sides, and desserts, all inclusive.  Our granddaughter wanted green beans.  She is 3, and frankly, the fancy stuff just does not impress her.  So here came a plate of green beans, which were taken away as soon as dinner arrived.  The staff is VERY quick on the withdraw.  We requested they bring the green beans back, and she got a plate of fresh - and very hot green beans.  We ate our meals, very nicely plated and well seasoned, but frankly, it was not even close to impressive, very tiny portions too.  I'm sure they were churning these meals out quickly in the kitchen, as it was very crowded in the dining room.  Our bill was over $300.00,( there was one glass of wine in that mix), because they mistakenly charged us for the 3 year old.  Even though the waitress asked us how old she was.  Nothing was very hot, nothing was very good, and I think that the price was totally out of line."}
{"text":"This is the perfect casual atmosphere with an amazing chef!   Everything was great, especially our service! I ordered straight off of the Yelp pics and I wasn't disappointed.   They were super accommodating too. We got there late and they stayed late and weren't rude and didn't make us feel like we needed to leave. In fact, they were so polite that at one point I looked up and realized everyone was gone and we should leave because they didn't do anything to alert us to that.   Very polite and professional with food quality that makes it an event!"}
{"text":"In the past this was a great Restaurant; but ever since the 2008/2009 recession the owner has never brought the restaurant back to its former self.  I took my wife here last night (1/13/18) and there are no words to describe what a deplorable experience we had.  The menu is a shell of its former self, and the food is terrible.  The owner should be embarrassed to continue prostituting the Cartwright name; he should shut this place down, and stop stealing the Customer's money!  Vote with your pocketbook and put this place out of it's misery!"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant!  The service was excellent.  The food was very good.  I had a medium NY strip steak that was cooked perfectly.  My husband ordered a special drink,  and it was so good that he asked for the recipe. And he got it!  Everyone was very pleased with their meal.  We have Washington DC trained palates, and we were suitably impressed. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 5, including one child and we all left full and happy. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were quite large. I had a duck appetizer and a steak that was well seasoned and cooked as ordered. After all of that I still managed to share the s'mores dessert with my son. He will tell you it is the best dessert he has ever had. The reservation process was easy, we were seated right away and the service was very good. I look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Since Brett and Cody took over, it's a completely new place. The decor is still the same but, like the menu, they're making small tweaks. They also have Joe DeRuyter and Sean back in the kitchen. Jennifer is back behind the bar and as sommelier. The wine is amazing. The pastry chef is also doing amazing things. So, if you know Cartwright's for steaks, they are still great but they are bringing in the most amazing fresh seafood today. I can't even tell you what you might get because it's always changing. The scallops tonight were to die for. Actually, we also had the trout. It's incredible. Go."}
{"text":"Great place in Cave Creek!  Love the western decor and atmosphere, the service was fantastic, and the food was great!  I enjoyed the lobster tortilla soup and the pork chop with glazed carrots and scalloped potatoes...yummy!  The portions are big, so I took a few carrots and the pork chop bone with some meat home to my dog...she loved it too!"}
{"text":"great ribeye, filets, and seabass..... lobster tortilla soup is great too.... Not alot of dining options in carefree so i was happy to discover cartwrights!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Cartwrights was pre-Yelp and I am sad to think that it's been so long between visits but Cartwrights is located right in the center of touristy Cave Creek and that is probably the reason why.   Our recent visit was to attend a memorial luncheon. Cartwrights went out of their way to ensure our large party was comfortable and well cared for. The food was spot-on. From salads to sandwiches, to steaks, to vegan there is something for everyone. The service was prompt, friendly, and eager to please. One of the kids in the party was a bit of a pickier eater and they went out of their way to ensure she was pleased with her food...a child-A child who was not paying the bill! But going the extra mile to ensure that EVERYONE was happy is my point and what made Cartwrights a 5 star experience. Drinks were kept full, food served at the perfects temps, and the room we had was beautifully done. I will not allow so much time to pass between visits."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart that I am giving Cartwrights one star but, as my fellow Cartwrights devotees can attest to, things have changed recently for the much worse. I have been eating here for ten years. Its a special occasion place where everything is fresh and delicious.  The new, laminated menu has erased most of the great dishes and combined things in a ludicrous way. The new beet salad had a small slice of a canned beet on it and was completely inedible with some sort of awful mustard dressing. The breads were different and the famous southwest cornbread was gone. The steak came with a side of canned corn (you could taste the brine), and was nowhere near fresh and likely frozen. I wasn't going to write this review, as this happened a few months ago, but I see many have had the same experience. I am a proud ten year resident of Cave Creek. I have recommended this restaurant to friends, brought people here on several special occasions and have always referred to it as one of the best restaurants in town. This review is written in the hope that they change everything back to the way it was."}
{"text":"When we walked in the door for our first visit to Cartwright's, we were immediately greeted by the friendly hostess. Upon being seated, water and bread were placed on our table, and our server greeted us and asked for our drink order.  I ordered the triple medallions: elk, bison, and steak because it was my husband's second choice. I told him I'd share. :) My husband ordered the quail macaroni and cheese (smoked gouda). Everything was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was amazing. In addition, the music playing was everything we love. I teased my husband, asking if he gave them a play list.  The atmosphere is elegant and casual at the same time. I'm not sure how they accomplish that, but they do. Everything is clean. The interior decorating is superior, with various textures and wall hangings that enhance the vibe of the restaurant.  For our anniversary, they gave us a little gift: homemade truffles. (You have to eat them fast in Arizona, or they will melt. That was my excuse anyway.) They were delicious, and the box was adorable. But they certainly went above and beyond to make sure our night was special.  The ownership just changed, but I'd never been there before. The owners said they are not changing a lot because the previous owners knew what they were doing. It is obvious that is true. Go enjoy a meal here during the week when it isn't packed. Have some fresh locally sourced food with a glass of your favorite beverage. Trust me that you will not regret it.  While this restaurant is listed as three dollar signs, I must say that it isn't that much more money than Longhorn or another chain steakhouse. However, the food here cannot even be compared to that food. It melts in your mouth, with the perfect combination of flavors and textures for a culinary delight.  I found my new favorite restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"Ok, here we go Cartwright's.   I've been living in Cave Creek for 13 years but  have only have been to Cartwright's a handful of times, including a few happy hours with limited food ordered. In the past couple of months, I've visited Cartwright's 3 times. I've noticed that a few recent reviews are complaining about the newly revamped menu. Since I have no opinion on the prior menu, I can only comment on the current menu and service level, which so far has been excelente!  Today, we celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary with our 9 year old (unexpectedly) in tow. Ha! No problem though, since the kids menu is DIVINE and comes with a nice side of wiki stix. My kids are total food snobs, and I am curious if the \"old\" menu had this selection of kids food? The new kids menu is perhaps the best \"kids menu\" I've seen anywhere. And I mean ANYWHERE. Scallops and filets on the kids menu? Are you kidding me? OH YES!!!   The service was totally on point. Waitress was great, offered great personalized suggestions and had intimate knowledge of the menu. The busboy constantly coming around filling waters, checking out the situation.... the service was on par with a 5 star restaurant. My only super minor complaint is that I wish they would've checked on the alcohol situation \"just prior\" to the entrees being served. This is what elevates a restaurant in my opinion, the timing of the wine/cocktail to the entree. Even excellent restaurants miss this. I quickly flagged down my waitress and got my wine in less than 90 seconds, so all was great. Anytime we needed anything, someone was there. These people know good service.   On the food: I had the diver scallops with crab in a Bearnaise sauce, and it was SO SO SO good and so rich. But, man, it was worth every calorie. Think the old Richardson's in central Phoenix, but better. Hubby had filet with spaghetti squash and potato/corn ravioli in a smoked gorgonzola sauce. We also shared the beet salad, and that was great as well. All were very happy with our choices.   They have a nice wine selection by the bottle, half bottle, and glass. Not super extensive, 25 page wine menu, but perfectly adequate for every wine taste.   The only issue I can see with the recent bad reviews is either, 1. People were accustomed to the \"old\" menu and just irritated about change (hey, people hate change), or 2. People don't like the new \"trendy\" food (as it was called in two prior reviews), and just want the old Midwestern steak and potatoes scene (which they still have!) This is Cave Creek, after all, you gotta consider the demographic. Perhaps people just want the old-timey ranch steakhouse back? This is 2016 people, the food is awesome. Deal with the change.   Call me a snob, but \"trendy\" food combined with good service is a winning combination. This is, by far, one of the best restaurants north of the 101 in the Cave Creek / North Scottsdale / Carefree area. I've been to them all, and Cartwright's is here to stay. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great steak a short drive from Scottsdale, this is your place. We made a reservation for 5pm on a Friday night and while we were the first to arrive, by 6:15pm the place was packed. After we cut into our steaks, we understood why.   We started with chips and salsa and it was great. There were 3 different salsas/guacamole and both corn and four chips.   After the chips and salsa the steak arrived. I ordered the 8oz filet and the wife ordered the NY Strip. Mine was cooked a perfect medium and was tender and juicy. While my wife ordered medium, it came out slightly overcooked but was still tender and juicy. I can't emphasize how amazing the steaks were. In addition to the steak, the sides, which are pre-selected/paired with each cut of meat, were tasty and the presentation was cool.   The kids menu was a cut above others. They have the standard chicken strips and fries but they can also get some great cuts of meat and even scallops. Our kids were the only 2 there for the 90 minutes we stayed and like any good restaurant, so long as they behave, I think kids are fine."}
{"text":"Fabulous.  Fantastic.  A group of six. 4 of the six had the trio of Elk, Beef, Bison and loved it.  I had the flat iron special.  Fantastic.  Only complaint - the beet salad was very LIGHT on beets - but they were fantastic.  I could have done without the cabbage piece of it - very nondescript - but the beets were fantastic.  Also, we were celebrating a birthday and brought a bottle of wine as a gift - not to share at the meal, but as a gift.  We weren't allowed to bring it in - I'm hoping it was liquor laws that forbade it.  If we had it in a bag or wrapped - it wouldn't have been a problem.  interesting.  But overall - a great meal!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good steak and wonderful service seem to be the theme at Cartwright's. The restaurant is a long drive from Paradise Valley, but our hotel concierge likes the warm Southwest feel.   She nailed this one, as we had wonderful service, great ambiance and the tenderloin was really excellent. Our server made on bones about it: With her Boston accent she proceeded to dis their New York and push the Sirloin and Tenderloin. I thought this was a Boston v New York thing, but she insisted. The medium rare tenderloin melted in my mouth and the mac n cheese is excellent.  The prices are extremely reasonable. We had a great time and enjoyed this dining experience!"}
{"text":"OMG! How very sad! This restaurant used to be my go to favorite place in Cave Creek for 10 or 15 years. I have spent hundreds and thousands of dollars having dinner with friends at Cartwright's. The food was excellent the service was great and quality was top notch. My last visit less than a week ago was such an incredible disappointment, I know I never will be back. Warm salad, a Caesar salad by the way that they served with whole green olives and reconstituted Sun dried tomatoes. What is that all about? I tried the lobster and crab cakes, again this big disappointment came out lukewarm. Very little lobster, not much crab but lots of filling. I understand it is under new management, and that there are some adjustments to be made. But it has been several months now since the new management and I just don't see much of an improvement.  Just so sad really, the end of an era."}
{"text":"Cartwright's is American Cuisine fused with Southwest ingredients. You have to give them credit for preparing everything in-house daily that means sauces,  breads and desserts. They proudly let you know they only use all natural steaks and mesquite grill them. They even employee a rising star pastry chef that prepares the desserts for Cartwright's and the sister restaurant Tonto.  They started us off with a nice fresh baked bread sampler and some really ice cold better that cracked the bread when you tried to spread butter on it. I started out with a bloody mary and I was impressed that they rimmed it with celery salt ( a nice touch ) but then after the vodka only added Mrs. T's Mix to it. Maybe this drink is out of style I don't really know but I thought a nice flavorful bloody mary with horseradish , maybe a dap of hot sauce and worcestershire would go really well with steaks in this old fashioned looking kind of place. Switched to wine it was fine.  Our server made the special salad of the evening sound really good and her story of the chef going out and picking the flowers from ocotillos impressed us so we split one of those salads to try. They did present us with two beautifully prepared salads. That were pristine fresh and had all the fruit and vegetables hand cut fresh to order. For me this might have been the high light of the meal.   The rest was good for it's price point and I'd go back!  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"We drove way out of our way to try this place because we heard that they had fresh fish. Was hoping for halibut, but they didn't have it yet, so we tried the ling cod. The fish was fresh and properly cooked, but it was extremely bland/flavorless/under-seasoned and the potatoes were undercooked as well. I would consider this an OK meal, but at $36 per plate, I expected better quality. I've had more flavorful food at local chain restaurants, for a lot less. Service was mediocre, at best. Our drinks sat empty for a good 15 minutes and the server walked by several times, before I finally had to stop her and ask for refills. When she asked how the food was and I told her it was \"just ok\", she seemed quite offended and pretty much ignored us the rest of the meal. We will not be back and I would not recommend Cartwright's. There are many other, much better, options available."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!  I have a tendency to only comment if things are poor, so this place made quite an impression.  We had the mason jar appetizer, the swordfish (special), trout, and creme brulee.  Mason jar appetizer with the duck, peaches and blue cheese was original and amazing.  The swordfish was the special that Saturday, and it was the best I have had.  This place gets creative, which I love.  If you are looking for an overpriced steak w/ melted butter for $100 a plate go to Mastro's.  If you are looking for something a little more adventurous Cartwright's is the place.  Excellent food, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"My husband had the Wagyu over Parparedelli, it was exceptional, service was excellent and atmosphere was nice ,a little pricey but well worth it, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a special place for me as I met my future husband here for our first date. Met a gf there last night and disappointed is putting it mildly. The wine was great because it wasn't made at Cartwrights. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and the waygu appetizers. For $14 we received 2 shrimp, yes you read that right, TWO SHRIMP. They were not worth $7 each in any way. We questioned only 2 and the bartender said \"there should be 4, I'll get you 2 more\". He then returned to tell us that indeed there were only 2 because of weight\". WHAT?!?! Then don't say there should be 4 and that you're getting us more. Simply unprofessional.   The waygu was ok but also very small and not worth the $16 cost. The man next to us ordered the Lobster & Crab Cakes and received 1, yes ONE. He started laughing at the ridiculousness of it. I'm not sure why you use a plural of \"cakes\" when it should be cake. He spoke with the manager and received another one but they never offered that to us.   So sad as I live in Carefree/Cave Creek and love to support local biz. The place was pretty much empty and maybe this is why. Disappointing to see a neighborhood gem decline like this. They have great long time wait staff but are certainly missing Roni and Loni at the bar and more quality food. I came home and ate my Pei Wei leftovers since I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was hopeful the experience would have been excellent.  Went in at prime time on a Friday and the place was empty which should have been a sign of what was to come.  We ordered our drinks then about 10 minutes later ordered calamari and chips n salsa.  The food and drinks came out together about 20 minutes later.  The calamari took 30 chews + to break down and the chips were stale.  We felt bad because the server was very nice.  My wife stopped our dinner order and the manager came over, he was apologetic and only charged us for the food we received.  So for $74 we all had a cocktail and sub par appetizers."}
{"text":"We have been there 4 times now  and all 4 have been excellent.  Great menu - wonderful servers, really solid scotch selection and their deserts are serious... Love the   ambiance - the place feels really warm and if I lived closer would be there weekly. Thumbs up..."}
{"text":"Had the filet and the server brought fresh horseradish on request. Hubby had a ribeye. The service, ambience, meal and wine pairings were spot on. I love this place! The only drawback is the price, but in this case you get what you pay for. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I still love it here but I found out tonight that they changed their menu and they have removed their steak sandwich. I'm heartbroken because I love this sandwich and hope they bring it back! Their food is still amazing though and I love their atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here recently for my sisters rehearsal dinner. We had about 15 people total and we were able to sit in their private dining room which was very nice. The decor of the restaurant was very welcoming and the service was great. We had a pre fixe menu available for the rehearsal dinner so this review is mainly based off of that menu. I'm not sure how much the cost per person was but some dishes were good and others needed some help. The salad to start off the meal was good and I loved the olives it came with. It was definitely on the small side though. After that we received grilled pita bread but I think the chef forgot they were on the grill because the majority of the pita wedges were burnt. The crab cakes were just okay. They needed more seasoning and an overall better flavor. The best part of the meal for me was the filet with the herbed gnocchi. Filed was cooked perfectly and was very tender. The gorgonzola sauce was actually very good considering I'm not a big fan of the blue cheese. Dessert was a chocolate cake that kinda just tasted store bought to me. Overall, they did a really good job with making everyone feel comfortable and the dishes were brought out in a timely fashion. I would just recommend some of their dishes either being prepared better or with bigger portions."}
{"text":"Cartwright's is a nice up scale cowboy themed restaurant located in Cave Creek. They offer a few game dishes including elk and wild boar. Some fish and of course, steaks. It was getting a little pricey, but the new menu is a little more wallet friendly."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go to restaurant for a nice evening out with my husband. The menu has gone tremendously down hill over these last two visits in the last couple of months.  Now you get a standard boring bread basket, instead of the different yummy bread selections they used to have.  We were told it is because they were wasting so much...here's an idea, plan better with the old bread selection instead of offering up a boring bread.  A couple months ago, the bread selection had dwindled, last night we were surprised at how the menu dwindled.  The selections were awful. They no longer have spicy salads, different sauce selections with a fish menu.  So we tried to embrace it by ordering something new.  I ordered the fish tacos.  They were awful. Their \"southwestern\" cooking style was some sort of pickling of peppers.  Not a good combination!  I ate one, just trying to identify the taste.  My husband had one and couldn't even stomach half of it! They also were wrapped in two corn tortillas for each taco...overkill! We couldn't even eat the third taco.  My husband ordered some sort of ranch style salad with 3 shrimp that were cold, being served in some tiny little skillet. Think the skillet was for looks since the shrimp was cold. He said there wasn't any flavor to the salad. It was very boring.  Our young daughter ordered off the child's menu and had a steak, mashed potatoes,  broccoli & a tiny cup of fruit. Everything she had tasted pretty good, except the steak was incredibly salty. Way too much salt for a kid and for me. My husband thought the steak was ok.  I am also going to mention the overall ambiance. It was so incredibly loud! Not sure what happened when they remodeled, but we used to be able to talk across the table and hear one another. Now it is so noisy, you have to speak loudly just to have a conversation and good luck hearing what your companion has to say.     Something on the menus stunk really badly too! Not sure if it was the wood they used or some sort of lacquer,  but it was awful.   The wood in the restaurant also smelled of stain or lacquer.  Not sure what product they used, but the place needs to be aired out for a couple months so it doesn't stink so much.  The only change this restaurant did that deserved a star was change their prices. They are lower. My meal used to run $28 just for my entree. Since it is no longer available, I tried nasty fish tacos for $15.  So it appears they have reduced their prices.  It is a good thing we didn't pay more than we did, because their menu change needs a lot of work!!!  Our waitress was friendly, so the staff is still worth their weight in gold!  I am really sad to say that my once favorite restaurant will no longer be on our dining radar. Now to find a new place to eat some really good food!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Cartwright's---during Restaurant Week---such a great incentive to try out new places!  DH started off with the burrata, heirloom tomato and honey vinagrette and I had the red chili elk meatballs.  DH loved his dish, and I really enjoyed mine, though it was just on the edge of too spicy.  For our entree, DH had the filet and I had the scallops.  DH said his filet was the best he'd had in AZ and one of the best ever.  Perfectly cooked, seasoned, tender...lots of flavor.  My scallops were equally delicious, but sadly, the entree was kind of an overall let-down.  The scallops had not been properly cleaned so every flavorful bite also included grit grinding between my teeth.  The tamale corn cakes were hard and crunchy---certainly, they had to be sawed with a knife, not a fork and were not the tasty masa I expected.  For endings, DH had an incredible creme brulee and I had the ooey gooey carrot cake.  Both were fabulous!  We will totally be back, but I will probably stick to the steak, which seems more a Cartwright's thing than seafood.  I will mention our server---I think her name was Mary Alice-Ann?  I am sorry I don't remember---she provided some of the best service we have experienced in the Valley.Warm, polished, professional and seemed to enjoy her job."}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the most awesome places I've ever eaten.   Master Chef Brett Vibber is a craftsman of presentation only out done by the quality of his unique cuisine and local wild fruits and herbs that are blended into various dishes.  I've eaten everything from macaroni and imported Italian cheese with a raspberry glazed quail sitting on top, to a mouth watering New York steak (see photo below) and a deconstructed blueberry pie (see photo below).  Take your loved one to Cartwright's, they'll never forget the experience. The drive up there is half the fun!"}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 0 stars but the ratings did not go that low. I live in Cave Creek and have come here for YEARS and YEARS on a regular basis. Their steaks were delicious and ambiance warm, western upscale, yet inviting. The recent changes to this restaurant now include very uncomfortable seating, cheap plastic menus and a rather disgusting menu..can you spell 'Elk-balls'! ICK!!! I can only assume the owner has had a mental breakdown or there is a new owner as the changes made over the last few months have sadly ruined this wonderful steak house. Besides a new seating area that looked a step above Arby's, the menu items were unrecognizable. The owners were so busy trying to be different, and nouveau that they have gone to ridiculous lengths to serve food prepared badly with idiotic food combinations and unrecognizable concoctions. The food servers seemed embarrassed by the changes, other patrons seem unhappy, the food terrible and service so, so. I personally saw a group of dinners seated, then walk out in disgust. We deliberated doing the same however 'stuck it out' to see if it was all that bad..IT WAS!! Avoid this excuse of a restaurant at all costs!! Will not be back unless they can prove they appreciate their customer, seat them to be comfortable..not to hustle people in and out efficiently, and bring back their former cooks, menu and ambiance. Note to management..nouveau in Cave Creek DOES NOT WORK!! Look at the HUGE turnover in the restaurants that go nouveau. Regulars like well prepared recognizable food they can depend on. Snowbirds (a huge part of Cave Creek's patrons) are no-nonsense folks that want food they can depend on, well prepared and recognizable, visitors will to to Scottsdale for nouveau if they want it..not drive to the end of the earth on Cave Creek for the 'unexpected'. New owners need to seriously reevaluate lest you will be resorting to coupons, sign twirlers at the driveway entrance and an empty restaurant! Get smart or get ready to seek employment in another field!"}
{"text":"Great upscale restaurant in Cave Creek.  They specialize in exotic meats like elk and venison and the whiskey bar is enormous.  Very classy and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went here for a wedding party.  The food was ok, nothing special, just loaded with garnish to make it look expensive to make.  They have some interesting choices for different types of meat.  The prices were a little on the high side, but it keeps the place classy.  Besides the different types of meats you can get, the ambiance is what makes this place one of a kind.  In the end, it's nothing to rave about and probably won't be coming back any time soon.  Nice to check out for once in your lifetime if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Cartwright's in Cave Creek with some real good friends to enjoy a \"date night\" without the kiddo's.  We've dined there before and really enjoyed it so we were looking forward to sharing this experience with some good friends.     The restaurant is decorated as a Sonoran Ranch House, it has sort of a \"Western Loungee\" vide to it.  It's not formal dining, but somewhat intimate and quiet with a \"YEEHA\" in there some where.  I think next time we come to Cartwright's I'm going to do it right and dress in my finest western attire, spurs and all!  They have a very nice bar for you and your friends to mozzie on up to for a tasty libation prior to dining.  The women had Prickly Pear Margatini's which they apparently enjoyed since they order a second round.  One of the guys had a Strawberry Daiquiri... (no comment, you know who you are...)  Myself and the other guy had manly drinks, Poquito Picante Margarita's with fresh Jalapenos in the drink and on the rim with light salt.  Wow, what a burning sensation at first drink, but man it was good! It gave new meaning to \"hot lips\", and our brides agreed with after a quick kiss :-)  That's probably why they ordered a second round, their lips were burning baby!     We had reservations since there were six of us and ate in the little room with the Elk head staring down at you above the fireplace while you ate.  This is the only reason why I'm giving Cartwright's 4.5 stars and not 5 because I'm a bit of a clean freak.  Don't take this wrong because I absolutely love greasy spoons, but they have to be clean.  I ask our waiter how often to they clean the Elk's head and he said he did not know when the last time it had been cleaned.  I'm not being a weirdo here, but yuck ~ dirty, dusty Elk hair and dead skin flakes floating in the air while I'm eating dinner kind of creep-ed me out.  It did not bother anyone else though...  Our salads, appetizers and entries were all extremely fresh, high quality.  They offer wild game, grass fed~organic beef and the most unbelievable seafood.  One of the coolest facts about Cartwright's is they purchase all of their produce, meats and dairy from local purveyors including seasonal items from the desert.  They have a very good wine list that will compliment your meal very well.    Between the six of us we had a sampling of almost everything they offered.  I really like their Elk Tenderloin, NY Strip and Chilean Sea Bass.  They have some very good deserts as well including Campfire S'mores, Cheesecake, Creme Brulee, or my fave was the Chocolate Ranch House Cake with a Mexican chocolate Kahlúa sauce, yum!  Great place to dine with someone special or invite some friends. Have some fun and make it a \"Western\" night out, yeeha!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on Saturday night and was immediately seated without reservations.  Sat at table for 15 minutes with NO acknowledgment from server.  Meanwhile other tables got drink and menu orders taken.  Got up and left.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this place is so popular. The ambience is relaxed yet upscale and the staff is accommodating and friendly. The sea bass was exceptionally good, and the angel hair pasta was perfect. My rib eye tasted great, although it was slightly over-cooked. Portions are generous and the deserts are exceptional.  It might be somewhat of a stretch to consider this a world-class restaurant; but you can take anyone here with complete confidence they will have an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Interestingly, we had great anticipation for a great dinner.  Sadly, we had a server who was so aggressive that it really undermined the experience.  She was more suited to be the person you encounter at a car wash asking if you want your windshield fixed, your car waxed, your interior lathered... it was really annoying.  I love Cartwright's so we will give them another try and we had a wonderful experience at Tonto B&G earlier in the day.  Let's just remember the goal of creating a great customer experience."}
{"text":"Had not been here for several years but returned last night for dinner. Have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. Their Happy Hour is about as good as it gets. Which means they have Scotch on their HH drink list. We both had the filet for dinner. Absolutely the best steak I have had in a very long time. Cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is upscale cowboy and why not? Cave Creek is cowboy country. We will not wait several years again to visit. It is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  My family and myself enjoyed everything. Thank you for an amazing restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Fantastic food. My steak had great flavor and was cooked perfectly. The horseradish in the mashed potatoes was a delicious touch. The Thanksgiving appetizer trio and dessert trio were so yummy. Great service from Nicole for our party of seven. I highly recommend Cartwright's!"}
{"text":"Mary was our server.  She really helped us sort out the menu items.  We enjoyed the elk and the buffalo medallions a lot.  The risotto was heavenly!  Four of us, and we shared...we were all happy!  The s'mores dessert? Rich!  Share it!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a group of horsemen.  Comfortable place, nice people.   Food was ok.   Steak was tasty, but not prime beef, but, hey, if it was they would have charged a lit more.   Good cesear salad.   Nice spot.   Would want to check out others in town before committing to return."}
{"text":"Good food great service awesome ambience. My first visit and I enjoyed everything and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"So delicious! Enjoyed restaurant week and the scalloped potatoes. Pastel de Tres Leches was the best dessert I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on numerous occasions, from a regular week night to New Years Eve and it is always incredible. The meat is top-notch and the sides and sauces make it a little different from the typical steak house. The staff is very friendly and professional, making it feel like a very fancy restaurant but in a slightly more casual environment. Cave Creek is pretty laid back so you will see everything from suits to shorts.  In the winter, sit near the fireplace."}
{"text":"This review is way over due. Cartwright's and Tonto Grill are our go to close to home places we really enjoy. The service at Cartwright's is friendly, fun and always professional.The young hostess's are very sweet. They open the door as you walk up to the restaurant. Nice touch! They just don't walk to you to your table, they always ask how is our evening.  We usually have Jules as our server. Jules is fabulous! She remembers us and goes the extra mile to make each visit memorable, All the servers are wonderful. My husband always orders the New York Strip. I go with a salad or a fish dish. The Rainbow trout is delicious and light.  Save room for the Inside Out Carrot Cake or the Campfire S'mores!!"}
{"text":"We got seated right away, cuz the place is huge! Super service, amazing wine and menu! We will be back and eat our way thru this great menu!"}
{"text":"Menu overhaul a big mistake! They completely changed the menu last year and I don't know why. Being able to order several choices of fish with different preparations was great. We were regulars here, but not any more. What I don't understand is why they did a complete overhaul when their sister restaurant Tonto, stayed the same. There is nothing wrong with tweaking the menu from time to time, but a complete overhaul will definitely alienate the regulars. Went to Tonto on Saturday night and drove past a mostly empty parking lot at Cartwright's."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great ambiance, good service. Fresh, wild, line caught salmon. We couldn't ask for more. We asked for a quiet table and they gave us one in a room that had no one else in it. Superb. We felt like royalty. He had the 22 oz bone in rib eye, I had the salmon, both were amazing.   If your looking for something that is fresh, healthy and casual you can't beat Cartwright's. We've eaten here 2 days in a row and will keep coming back. It's our hidden gem.   Try happy hour- delicious sushi, seafood and creative modern options.   We met one of the owners when he asked if we enjoyed our meal. The nicest guy. Hard working. He really cared about our experience. The kind of person your happy to give your business to.  We stay at the Four Seasons so this is an ideal location."}
{"text":"When I was told that Cartwrights serves 'game meats', I was worried that it would be the type of place where I would need to avoid making eye contact with taxidermied animal heads mounted on the walls. To my relief, there was neither a buffalo nor elk head in sight to gaze at me accusingly. Instead, the interior reminded me of a rustic and comfortable yet upscale ranch house. I especially liked the ambiance added by the fireplaces within each room. Although they were not lit (hey, it is summer in AZ) I can imagine how welcoming they would be on a chilly evening.   Oh, the menu! It had a little bit of everything - seafood, steaks & game, poultry & pasta. It was hard to decide what to choose, since so many things looked good. I went with the salmon prepared Mediterranean style. Wise decision! It was beautiful - pan-roasted with artichokes, leeks, garlic, roasted tomato & spinach, atop pesto-tossed angel hair pasta. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost. My friend, more adventurous than I am, chose the buffalo tenderloin. Prepared medium-rare, it came with wild mushrooms and a peppercorn sauce that was beyond good. I had never tried buffalo, and was pleasantly surprised by both the texture and taste. Of course, my positive opinion could have been influenced somewhat by the mini-cauldron of mac & pepper-jack cheese...   The wine list is impressive, with a wide selection of all things good that come from grapes. I have been on an AZ wine run lately, and chose the AZ Stronghold Nachise (a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah). My friend went with the Rutherford Ranch cab (great with the buffalo!), and we were both happy.   What a nice way to spend an evening meal. Our server was outstanding - attentive but not overbearing and very knowledgeable too.   I already know what I want to try next - filet mignon and the S'Mores dessert are calling to me!"}
{"text":"\"Cartwright's Sonoran Ranch House is more than a restaurant; it is a means for honoring the legacy of the settlers of the American Southwest. Not only do we take great pride in our food, drinks and service, we also aim to preserve Arizona's heritage by sharing the stories of our property's past. We fuse Southwestern ingredients, top-notch beef and game meats, and the best quality seafood we can find, and present them in a warm, welcoming atmosphere rich in Arizona lore.\"  Those words are certainly true when it comes to this rustic yet modernized Steakhouse. This place is unique with its beautifully designed interior along with its friendly and upbeat staff. Our waitress named Mary was very respectful, and she gave us a pleasant experience for our very first visit to this place.  The Tortilla Soup (which I recommend) was full of flavor with its smooth texture, and elegant fragrance. Absolutely delicious! Shortly afterwards, our Steaks came. I admire the presentation, but of course the taste is where the glory stands. The Bone-In Rib Eye was tender as well as juicy and it was not overcooked surprisingly. And of course the other dishes we had were also excellent.  Cartwright's does well in meeting guest expectations, from the atmosphere to the service and to the food. We will definitely return in the near future to have an enjoyable evening once again.  Website:  http://www.cartwrightssonoranranchhouse.com/about-cartwright/about-us/"}
{"text":"Staying nearby at the Boulders and went for an early dinner , the greeter was nice , once sated never told who our server would be and when he did come to our table never introduced himself which after reading the bill find out it was  Martin , not sure if he was new but sure seemed like it   didn't go over menu options or anything,  anyway started with the lobster / crab cakes which were very good being that Martin was not with we just ordered another order of that , also tried both soups which were very good , backing up to the compalmentery bread that was so bland , not very good at all , decided to skip a steak but ordered a drink a piece wife had a white wine which was good I had a Manhatten which was apsoultly trebbile $70 bill  were out , may come back to just try a burger but the service needs to improve."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend recently while visiting. I had the trio of meat (Elk, Buffalo, and Beef) and it wasnt bad but also not phenominal. It was cooked to temperature and the portion sizes were fair but it didnt...pop. A bit underwhelming based on the existing reviews and price.  My friend was fairly let down, I guess they recently had a major menu overhall which he and his wife thought wasn't as good, so regulars beware.  The place itself has a nice vibe to it, with the exception of the menus...which seem like a cheap diner. Pretty sure its the first time ive ordered a 40 dollar dish off an orange laminated menu.  Overall it was good but not great and wont be on my \"must visit\" list when I return."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the Valley and easily one of the best in the entire Cave Creek/Carefree area.  Service is perfect, the food is outrageously good and the wine list is a dream.  Expensive, but you will gladly fork over the money after you finish your dinner.  The place to take your out of town guests to if you want to impress them with good food and sophisticated dining."}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my boyfriend to Cartwrights after I had a wonderful dinner with my mother several months ago. After sitting down I noticed right away they completely changed their menu. No longer can you pick your steak sauce and sides, and you are bound by set selections. Not only did they change their main menu, but the chocolate cake I was so excited to get as dessert has now been changed to a gluten free VEGAN cake! Vegan cake?! Who the heck comes to a steakhouse to order a vegan dessert? Come on Cartwrights why did you change something that was so wonderful? Needless to say I was disappointed in the menu change, and we headed to Mastro's for dessert to have a real chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. We enjoyed the tasting menu with the wine pairing. One of the best meals we've ever had. The tasting menu had very interesting selections, the local wines were delightful and the cheesecake mousse with fresh berries was pleasant way to finish the experience."}
{"text":"Total disappointment.  Not busy so we  expected good service. Instead our server forgot the promised wine chiller and virtually ignored our table and chatted all night with another table. She never checked  on our satisfaction with our dinner. The soups were nice. The rib eye was overcooked and tough. My mushroom side was inedible as it was burned. The  Ahi Tuna was cooked well, but the sauce was watery.  At the prices charged, Cartwright's should have been better."}
{"text":"Still love it! We have been a few times after the new menu, and last weekend we noticed  it has changed a bit again. Namely, two key steaks are back: the filet and ribeye. Yay for this!!   My hubs and our two other guy friends loved the filet. I enjoyed the club salad with shrimp (sweet, jumbo grilled white Mexican shrimp....delish!)    Can we talk customer service? One person in our group had just had knee replacement surgery, and the servers and management were exceptionally accommodating, bringing a side chair for him to elevate, and offering to bring pillows and ice packs.    That's great service and great food. And the new bar area is fantastic. We love it."}
{"text":"Vacationing in Carefree and decided on Cartwright's for our first night. So glad we did! The bread that started us off was the best complimentary bread I've ever had - onion and fennel. The menu had a lot of options and plenty of ways to customize the meal. I had the shrimp Sonoran style, which was very unique to the area. A little on the pricey side, but worth it."}
{"text":"Just had the elk bison burger with roasted jalapeños....food was amazing! Perfectly cooked with tons and tons of flavor! This place has never disappointed me! Mary behind the bar was awesome too!"}
{"text":"We made reservations here for Valentine's Day dinner to enjoy with friends in town for the occasion.  The \"prix fix\" menu looked good with good options. We were disappointed with all of the entrees.  The chicken and mushroom risotto were dry; the salmon was overcooked and dry as was the lobster in the \"surf & turf\" entree.  The steaks were passable and cooked as ordered. This was after waiting an inordinate amount of time for the entrees to arrive!  Makes me wonder how long the entrees sat under the heat lamp drying out!  The dessert was to be red velvet cakes layered with ginoche and frosted.  Red velvet cake is usually moist, but this was dry and tasteless even though it was pretty.    Valentine's Day (night) is a very busy night for restaurants, but with a pre-set, limited menu, meals should be good and presented promptly.  This was most certainly NOT the case.  It should be noted that our server was pleasant and attentive.  I think even she suspected that something was amiss because she kept assuring us that our meals were on their way as we watched other tables receive their entire meals and leave while we kept waiting.    We were prepared to pay a little more for a  special meal and were very disappointed that a table of four diners paid nearly $300 and had such a bad meal.  We will not return for another visit, nor would we ever recommend this over-priced restaurant.  There are too many other good options from which to choose.  Dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the first thing I smelled upon entering the restaurant was the sewer out front.  However, when I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the rustic, yet classy ambiance.  The ahi tuna and oyster appetizer was delicious.  My husband enjoyed his juice and well seasoned Ribeye steak.  The dessert was an awesome, crunchy, not-too-sweet apple fritter with cream dipping sauce.  I would have have given this place 5 stars, but the waitress forgot about us after dinner was served and it took over 15 minutes to find her to get the check.  We will still return and try some additional dishes.  If you are looking for a \"nice, sit-down\" restaurant in Cave Creek...this is the place!"}
{"text":"We became acquainted with Cartwrights when we first moved to Phoenix and stumbled upon their History dinners. This was our first trip back under the new ownership and we were not disappointed. Our server (Chris) was friendly, observant and checked back on us without being intrusive. Having several dietary restrictions makes me a difficult diner, but  Chris was not only knowledgeable but double checked and even wrote the nut restriction on the order. My husband ordered the wild game stroganoff which was an extremely ample portion. (He couldn't finish!). It was very hearty with a nice blend of flavors. I don't usually order fish in AZ, mainly because I haven't had a lot of well-cooked seafood. However, the Ling cod and scallop entree called to me and I was definitely not disappointed. The fish and scallops were cooked perfectly, but I was equally impressed with the accompaniments. So often,  vegetables seem just to be an afterthought, but not in this case. This dish was good--really good, and considering the low lighting in the restaurant, I briefly considered holding up my napkin and licking the plate. Let's not forget the fabulous bread, easily my downfall when the basket sits on the table while you wait for your entree. We finished off by sharing the mesquite chocolate cake. (Actually, I didn't share much of it). There was no particular occasion for our visit but it was a very memorable night."}
{"text":"Upscale, cowboy southwest style restaurant. They serve some interesting steaks from elk, buffalo, and other game. It seems popular with the older, cave creek population. The elk steak was delicious, and everything else was good. Unfortunately they were out of multiple dishes, and their tap water tasted really minerally."}
{"text":"A good steak can be a hard thing to find.  First clue, no need for \"steak sauce\" or any elbow grease with the knife and fork.   Get the trio of filets.  Beef, Elk and Buffalo.  I also had the jalapeno mac & cheese.  I could eat this all the time!!!! This stuff is like crack!    Elk is amazing meat, I had no idea.  Very flavorful.  Far less gamey than deer.  This place is kind of a cross between casual and fine dining, I was kind of at a loss for what to wear or what to feel comfortable in here.  They also have a solid wine list and some great aged scotches.   If you're in the mood for a steak and don't want the all you can eat of a Brazilian steakhouse, come check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going 4.5 stars here as I have no idea what else they could have done to bump themselves up to 5 other than perhaps not be 50 minutes away from my house which isn't their fault, but hey, I'm selfish, so there.  Now that the longest sentence in the history of Yelp is finished, I will get on with my review. I went here a few weeks ago with my manfriend and his manfriend after deciding we were all collectively too lazy to cook, and crap am I glad we did! Upon entry, I was immediately pleased with the old fashioned, rustic decor. I'm talking antique wooden benches by the hostess stand, deep browns and reds throughout the restaurant including a giant copper wood burning fire pit in the center of the main dining room.  Now on to the food. I'm not terribly into game meat to be honest so I knew right from the beginning I was going steak. Ended up settling with their beef tenderloin which I paired with the best god damn mac n cheese you have ever had in your entire life! I got broccolini as well which was also delicious but I would've married that mac n cheese that night. Steak was cooked perfectly, incredibly tender and flavorful, and oh so juicy.  The boys were a little more adventurous than I. My manfriend's manfriend going with the trio of quail, elk and buffalo, which he killed every last bite by the way, and my date got the elk, which he talked about for 36 straight hours, so I have to imagine they were both pretty darn good.  On to dessert, which for some reason we felt the need to order even though none of us could move after our entrees. I got the smores. That's right, I said SMORES. If I'm going to be honest, it was a tiny bit rich for my taste, but whatever, they had smores on their menu and that made me love them that much more.  Decent wine list pretty reasonably priced in my humble opinion. Settled on a few bottles of the Row 11 Pinot to pair with our dinners that only ran us $45 a bottle if memory serves.   From start to finish, I had a caesar salad to start, the petite filet with 2 sides, smores for dessert, and my share of 2 bottles of wine and my bill was like $90 or something like that. I didn't need to eat for another 2 days mind you.  Oh, and this probably goes without saying but the service was impeccable. Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and sweet, never rushing us for a second even when we were the last table in the dining room savoring our desserts and finishing our last bottle of wine.  Run don't walk to Cartwright's, you'll be glad you made the trip."}
{"text":"Good meats. Everyone enjoyed the filet, ny strip, and the trio meat combo. The sides that came with the meats were OK but not great but they may have been great to someone else's tastes. Did not try their desert since we had one at home. Coffee was good."}
{"text":"This is the BEST of Cave Creek!   My husband took me here for my birthday. It was a pricy meal!! However, my taste buds have never.. EVER been as happy as they were at Cartwight's. Everything from the appetizer to the desert was truly amazing! Better than you know what!!   The ambiance was very comfortable, and relaxing. Something that is truly a rare find in a restaurant of this caliber.  (I didn't feel as if someone was looking at me and judging me for using the wrong fork. :)  I can't say enough about this place. Everytime we drive by- my mouth waters! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We were trying to decide on eating at Flemings when we found this place. I'm glad we decided to eat here because it was fantastic. The steak was cooked right and was a good cut as well. The best part for me was the price. I guess I'm just used to paying $150 for a good steak dinner at this point because I was quite surprised when my bill was half that price."}
{"text":"Fan-flipping-tastic!   We were up in Cave Creek for a concert at Janey's coffeehouse...and we were early and stumbled into this restaurant.  Although time was a little tight...they were able to seat us and serve us in time for the concert.  The menu has so many wonderful sounding dishes.  I loved my elk burger and my wife had some sort of steak medalions.  Both were delicious.  The staff were super attentive and friendly.  Highly suggest you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. Who would have thought that such good food could come out of Cave Creek. The Chef-owner Brett Vibber spent a great deal of time with our family during the meal, sharing the amazing work his group does to forage and grow their own produce. I ordered the salmon, my husband ordered the bison burger, both were incredible. My mom ordered the strogonof, so freaking good. My sister in law ordered a steak and I'm not sure how it was because she protected it like a prisoner's last meal. My brother ordered Chef Tasting menu and this was by far the best thing we had of the evening. Course after course was brought out, sashimi, scallops, steelhead, bone marrow, bison, foie gras. everything built so nicely on the prior dish. We finished the meal with the wild berry pie and dark chocolate mousse cake, both were phenomenal. Our waiter was funny, prompt, and extremely helpful. Just a wonderful experience all around."}
{"text":"We tried Cartwright's for the first time. My sister used to go but stopped because the food wasn't worth the price.  My husband and I thought we would give it a shot.  He ordered th 16oz bone in rib eye and and said it was the toughest steak he ever had and they charged $44 dollars for it.  I ordered the cod and my meal was fine, but $36 for that fish was a bit expensive.  The best part of the meal was the dessert, the cave creek cheese cake was one of the best I ever tasted.  It is not worth the price of the meal for the dessert, so I don't think that we will be back."}
{"text":"WOW, a new place with a very different menu. A must to try. Real nice bar also. Belly up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations for the AZ History Night dinner - great concept to have a nice meal and be entertained with great historical authentic cowboy stories & music.  The menu looked amazing on paper but was lackluster in person. Quail appetizer was just ok, very tiny but the main course was a disaster! Braised stew of beef shank and short ribs, cabbage, squash, white beans, corn..........which turned out to be a watered down soup - no substantial meat at all - it was as if it was put through a blender.  The desert and coffee were good -the evening's saving grace was my husband's favorite wine - Chateauneuf Du Pape which we ordered separately from the $55 per person package dinner.  Things I'd change: Entrée should be an entrée, Entertainment should start when the entree was served, Entertainment shouldn't include dealing with technical difficulties (picture stream on a screen -vs- bright blue blank screen) Coffee or after dinner drink service should be more than dropping off your coffee with your check and never returning for potential refill. I consider the $55 price tag for last night's meal highway robbery -  if I want soup, I'll go to a sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure the meal or the service could have been any better.  Steak was cooked to perfection.  Generous portions( my gal and I usually split a meal and there was MORE than enough ).  Our server was fun, friendly and very accommodating.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Since my mother's birthday was December 24th our family has a tradition to go out for a fine dinner every year on Christmas Eve. Since moving to Arizona we have gone to Cartwright's annually.   With the change of ownership this year the fixed holiday menu has been supplemented with the regular menu.  The new menu offers a broad selection and the food is well prepared and delicious. Game meats like elk and bison are available as is Wagyu beef and an excellent selection of seafood. There's even a kids menu so yes, chicken tenders and fries are available.   Tonight we sampled a number of appetizers including crab cakes, calamari, elk meatballs and the chef's special. All were excellent.   Everyone raved about their entrees. Personally, I chose the tuna, and the flavor was excellent but rare does not mean stone cold. Sorry, that was a real disappointment. My wife is still talking about how perfect her filet mignon was.   Service is very good too from greeting through to departure.   I'm looking forward to a repeat visit."}
{"text":"From staff all the way up to the owners this is an excellent experience.  Our normal server Mary is a true professional and can't say thank you enough to her, the crew & John for the constant appreciation to they're customers!"}
{"text":"We love Cartwright's!  I've lived in Cave Creek for 5 years and have dined here many, many times. The food here is superb and the service is even better. My absolute favorite is the beef stroganoff. The lobster bisque is great and you can't beat their wine list. They have a great happy hour too. Their black bean hummus is super yummy. Even if I didn't live in Cave Creek I'd make the drive."}
{"text":"This has been in Cave Creek for a long time.  It just changed hands, so see what happens.  The food is good and atmosphere is cowboy theme. They have a nice happy hour.  We will come back to see what happens with new owners."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to share a meal with someone you love. Even in my long sleeve button down and nice jeans I felt overdressed. My ribeye was cooked perfectly, but seemed to lack something that I just couldn't place. Pepper jack mac and cheese was delicious, probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had. My date's trio of meat was, um, interesting...the elk was a little gamey for me but the buffalo was awesome.   Service here is incredible...we were the last table to leave and instead of ushering us out, we had a nice 20 minute conversation with our waiter (who shares a very rare last name with my date)."}
{"text":"I wish we could give it more stars, but some times things do not go according to plans.  We have not been here in a few years and thought we would try it for Mother's day.  Plus we were looking for some Organic food without any hormones, chemicals or anti-biotics.  The portions are very very small and the prices are very very high. The wait staff is great, sometimes they forget things and need to ask them a few times but they eventually bring you the things you ask for.  The menu has changed since last time we came.  Was happy to see they have a few more apps, we did not get any as the waitress told us they were really small plates and not enough to share for the family - so we passed.  Also please beware the menu does not list all the ingredients in the food so if you have allergies please ask - for instance I really was looking forward to trying the Mac & Cheese,  I have had Mac & Cheese everywhere nothing was listed on the menu except Mac & Cheese which was the worse I have ever tasted.  Plus they put hot peppers and bacon it in, for me since I do not like pork when I ordered just plain Mac & Cheese I should have gotten it but they added stuff which is not listed on the menu which is why only a 3 star rating. The price of the 6oz elk is a little high especially since a pound of elk sells for less than ten dollars so them charging close to forty for 6 oz does not make much sense money wise.  The decor is nice, some of the tables are way to close to together and you can feel like a sardine when it gets crowded.  I like sitting in the the small room with the fireplace better than the outside larger rooms it was a little nicer. The tap water they put in the glasses is disgusting tasting, opt for the fuji bottled water. All the menus items can be changed to your liking so if you wanted something different you can get it sometimes without a charge sometimes with a charge.  All in All in was a delicious meal with just one or two problems and the food was good, the amount of food and the problem with the Mac & Cheese plus no one was willing to make an accommodation for the problem with the Mac & Cheese and I told two wait staff and my waiter and still nothing.  I even called and spoke with Anthony the next day and nothing."}
{"text":"Ya, no.  First off, I used to LOVE the old Cartwrights.  It was a spot we always took visitors, a place to be recommended to locals, and a super \"really nice night out\".    Not. Any. More.  We took the BF's parents here this week.  Reserved a lovely table by the fireplace, and that didn't disappoint (two stars for ambiance and not fucking up the ressie).  Food - totally meh.  The new chef ruined what was once a superb menu (sorry, bro, but this food isn't your sweet spot).  How many vegetarian/gluten-free and vegan dishes does a cowboy steak house need??? How much incorporation of vegetarian/gluten--free and vegan elements do meat protein dished require?  Anyway, I had ordered the duck appetizer.  Wish I stopped at reading the menu description, because that's as good as that dish got.  BF had the elk balls.  I've had better balls at a college keg party (that wasn't even serving food.)  Salads at the table...fine - no complaints.  Entrees...had the pork shoulder, tasty enough...ribeye...reminded me of the quality of sale meat from Frys, and stroganoff...wow - super disappointment, as that was once a mega signature dish of Cartwrights, and something you looked forward to.  It has been morphed into something you'd find from a macro-biotic chef forced to cook with meat.  Shame, shame.  Desserts...not even close to the magnificence of the previous Cartwrights.  BF and I split the banana cream pie, and we are both confirmed sugar addicts, guilty of licking a few plates around town.  We both left it over.  Not a good sign from us.  :(  Overall, chef is trying too hard to fuse foods to make a kitchy-sounding menu, but is forgetting 101 of flavor blending.  Service - this is where Cartwrights really bit the big one.  Midway through apps, entrees are dropped.  Seriously???  Everyone stared at each other in disbelief, as you'd expect better service from Olive Garden.  Forget about the kitchen being completely clueless on the timing of firing entrée and sending out the meals, let's talk about the utter numbness of the runner.  How checked out do you need to be to drop plates when people are still eating their first course???  Appetizers were pushed aside to make room for the entrees as shock passed over the table.  Total service fail.  I excused myself to find our server to discuss a birthday plate for Moms AND to complain (yes, I am that girl), and was told I should tell the manager.  Talk about a pass over.  That said to me, \"I not only don't really care, but I hear this a lot.  Please tell someone who might take action, as I'm tired of banging the drum.\".  The manager was appropriately solicitous, but boy, dinner was pretty well killed at this point. Thank God I have a glowing personality and can keep the conversation going, as the enjoyment of the meal wasn't going to be a topic.  Oh, and the apps?  Left uneaten, as you'd expect.  The manager comped our apps (who cares - it wasn't about money, it was about the experience), but that sadly didn't take the sting out of the marginal food.  We won't be back.  Cartwrights of yesteryear, RIP.  You are fondly missed."}
{"text":"Since moving to the valley, Cartwright's has been a staple. Not only for family celebrations but also for quiet dinners as a couple. Splitting a dish and a bottle of wine was always a great time. We were excited with the new owners and obviously wish them all the success. New Year's day was our third or fourth trip after the new ownership.  An updated menu and a few changes are visible but we hoped for the same great service and Cuisine. Our out-of-town guests were excited by our descriptions of great dinners at Cartwright's and we modified our plans to go there for dinner.  Our waitress was not the best, and with seven or eight tables in the restaurant the 2 servers seemed overwhelmed.... maybe it was the kitchen?   In our party we ordered the salmon roll from the cold plate section. Unfortunately it looked like something from the local grocery sushi bar placed decoratively on a large plate. Very underwhelming. The pork shoulder was horrible, lacking  visual  appeal and flavor.  Several people ordered the game Burger. Each of them had a different cooking request. When the burgers were eventually served, the servers did not check who had medium, medium well, medium rare e t c. We ended up sorting through the burgers and adjusting as needed. It was impossible to recognize any of the unique game combinations in the burger, as the meat was incredibly salty. This may have been offset by the grilled bun, except the burger sat waiting to come out seemingly for so long that the bun was gooey . Everyone eventually picked through their dinners and flagged down our server to get the check.   Such a disappointment. I don't know that we'll go down this path again. Feel like we're saying goodbye to an old friend I'll post two stars instead of one as a nod to their variety in a somewhat compact menu"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Service! We went there for my husbands birthday. Though it was a Friday night and we did not have reservations, we were seated in a cozy quiet seat. Beautiful decor, Very warm. I ordered from the new vegetarian menu. The beet salad is delicious. My entree, the Sopes, was rich with flavor and texture. The corn masa part was a little heavy and slightly greasy. I prefer the veggie nosh at Tonto. My husband had the shrimp cocktail, he LOVED it and the NY strip, that came w a LOT of Brussels sprouts (that could have a bit more charred/roasted) and au gratin potatoes that were delicious. The strip was very good. Kara, the server, was friendly and conscientious. We did not order dessert. The manager, Chris, picked up our credit card to assist Kara as he had done all evening w all tables. He asked for ID for the c/c. Unbeknownst to us he had glanced at the birthdate and realized it was my husbands birthday. He quickly returned to our table w a candlelit raspberry and two housemade truffles. We were so surprised and touched as we hadn't mentioned the birthday. Nicely done Cartwrights. Above and beyond!!! We shall be back."}
{"text":"We had never eaten here before.  Parking is in a very dark gravel lot.  We came without reservations and were seated quickly.  Food in general was satisfactory.  We had house special rib steak on a bone for $46.00.  Baked potatoes were hours old and barely warm.  Side sauces: wine sauce great and bearnaise was cold and separated.  Salad was a small plate of a few micro greens and dressing ($8.00).  Bread on table was warm and wonderful.  Desert was chocolate and to die for.   Decor was average and nothing special.  Service was ok: first too much and then missing in action.  Very pricey for an ok dinner.  I would not return.  Really way too much to pay for just an average meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cartwright's several times, and every visit has been highly enjoyable. I've never had any dish that wasn't perfectly cooked and very tasty, but I've only ordered their various steaks. Not big on chicken dishes. They also serve a Hefeweisen from Oak Creek Brewery. Well worth the visit for that alone!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience. Service was good but the food was poor. Steak was undercooked- that happens - and they fixed it right away. Found a foreign item in the import beer I had. They replaced right away. My wife's Beet salad (main course) was really terrible. You'd need a magnifying glass to find the beets and the grilled chicken was blah. Waiter was great as was the manager. Lots of choices in Cave Creek, maybe keep looking?"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wait staff!  The ribeye steak was great - full of flavor and complimented with delicious sides. My wife had the Turquoise salad and loved it!  We'll be coming back!!"}
{"text":"What  you have in Cartwright's is a pretty standard steakhouse that does everything right and doesn't charge an arm and a leg.  The ambience is typical western and comfortable and the service was fine.  The steaks are pretty good, and I say this based on the \"sampler\", which is 3 oz. each of beef, buffalo, and elk tenderloin.  These were well prepared and tasty, especially the elk which is as good as any elk I have had anywhere.  The halibut was also perfectly cooked and seasoned.    I wouldn't call Carwright's inexpensive, but for a steak house you usually expect to pay more than $30 for an entree.  Furthermore, you can get 2-for-1 couples, for example using the Preferred Restaurants card."}
{"text":"Better Steak Houses in the Area! The decor is amazing & quaint. That old western feel. I ordered Filet with a baked potato. It's a Wednesday night at 7:30, the waitress comes back & says they're out of baked potatoes. HUH?! Food does not match the prices. From all the restaurants in the area, not sure I'd come back."}
{"text":"Cartwright's Modern Cuisine did not disappoint! They have an amazing happy hour that you must not miss! Prices are amazing and the staff is always knowledgeable and attentive. Cody makes you feel right at home. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a bad meal here! Amazing food, wine list and overall a great little gem in Cave Creek. My husband and I frequent this place for dinner (the tenderloin trio is amazing) and I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a fantastic meal. It's also very romantic in the winter, cozy with a nice fireplace!"}
{"text":"Western style place in Cave Creek pretty casual.  Steak is good although i have had better.  Usually sit at the bar and bartenders are friendly.  Bread is fabulous there, Gin and tonic cant go wrong, spinach is okay.  My friend had the yam with tortilla strips and have to say that was pretty fantastic also."}
{"text":"We three had a wonderful experience at Cartwright's tonight.  Sat at the bar, good draft beer selection and a menu so interesting it was hard to order.  I had the stroganoff,  my son visiting from NY had quail mac and cheese.  My wife had trout.  We each very much liked our meals.  In addition, the bartender was helpful, friendly and A great representative of the restaurant.  It was as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Mothers Day Visit: Ordered Ribeye and Wife ordered Quiche. Worse steak I've ever paid over $12 for. Here I paid $38 The steak was full of fat, flat and full of grizzle:  You think of a Steak place to have a thick and tasteful steak but it was on the level of iHop or Denny's. My Wife's Quiche was dry and the crust was over cooked. Best thing was the cheeseburger my daughter was eating. Not worth the $100 tab and service was above average but not stellar since it was empty at 2pm.  Boy I had high expectations for this place but will never go back. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food at reasonable/fair prices.  Recently had their grilled shrimp cocktail appetizer as part of AZ RW 2015.  It was one of the best shrimp dishes I have ever had in my life. I plan to go back just for that dish.  Service is good and family friendly."}
{"text":"Went to the Ranch House last night for a company dinner and had to write up a review. I have to say first off that this little gem is worth driving to for the steak if for nothing else! The atmosphere was warm, ranchy, yet orderly and well appointed. Sort of a combination of true western (it really was a ranch at one time) and eclectic modern tones. Add soft lighting and you've got Cartwright's relaxing ambiance.  First of all, ALL of their menu items are made in-house, which is no mean feat. Our group had a semi-prefix menu (smart idea), and my boyfriend and I chose the all natural, mesquite grilled tenderloin (like butter!) with \"smashed\" potatoes, asparagus, and Béarnaise sauce as the main course. Before that came homemade breads and an appetizer of quail leg (so tiny but wonderful) with blackberry sauce and jack cheese grits (unique!), and then a lovely, fresh salad of watercress, Gorgonzola, and pecans on top of grilled apples with a white balsamic vinaigrette. Yum. Desert was a visually stunning bruléed lemon ricotta cheesecake sitting atop limóncello sauce. Portions were perfect size and seemed to all work together so you didn't feel stuffed at the end. Nice serving time intervals as well, which is always a challenge with a big group (we were about 30).   Prices range from about $15 to $30 for main courses.   Plus, we found out that they do something called \"Arizona History Dinners\" where they provide a speaker on an old west topic, plus a great dinner. Sounds unusual and promising. We'll have to check that out in the future.  All in all, superb food, great service, lovely atmosphere. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Prescott to eat here the food was well worth it!! I ordered the SALMON with the balsamic glaze it was so flavorful and cooked to perfection! I substituted out the side of squash for a side of mash potatoes ( I'm a lover of anything potato) and I could have eaten them as a meal themselves they were so good, (were like a cheesy mash potatoes). My fiancée ordered the ELK, BEEF, BUFFALO TRIO and ate every bite. While my father ordered the PORK SHOULDER -amazing - so much meat- so flavorful. Overall the food was perfect, not giving it 5 starts cuz we were really looking for an experience since it was our first time and our server really didn't seam what she was doing."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicken Club Salad... Almost... more than I could eat. No room for desert though."}
{"text":"We have been going to Cartwrights for years and, as Cave Creek residents, it was our \"go to local\" for \"fine dining\". The change of ownership seems to have been more than just a change of ownership ... there has been a change in quality too, sadly. I went there about a month ago and sat at the bar for dinner. I had the rib eye special, which was so fatty I couldn't eat it. I pointed it out to the lady bartender (a new face to me), who just shrugged as she removed my plate. Halfway through my meal I could have used a refill on my wine - but there was nothing I could do to get the bartender's attention, and so I never got it. No offer of any compensation, in kind or otherwise, for my sub-standard ribeye. I left, hoping this was just a bad night. Last night my wife and I gave it another try. My glass of wine was off, and the waitress replaced it immediately. My wife is a vegetarian/vegan and although the choices were few, her picks were good and enjoyable. I could find nothing on the menu I liked. The usual New York strip had been \"messed around\" a bit from how it usually was and some of the ingredients were ones I did not like. Same with the fish and other options - all, at least for me, not choices I would have made. So I settled for the Bison/Venison Stroganoff. Big mistake, as it was a splodge of large, tough noodles smothered in a thick sauce of no known origin, all brown in color and very unappetizing. I left more than half of it. The service was excellent though! We will not be going back ... unless something changes on the menu. With the \"Sonoran Ranch House Cuisine\" moniker having been changed to \"Modern Cuisine\", I would say that \"Modern\" is not good .. at least in its current iteration. Come on Chef Bret - you can do, and have always, done better than this!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed this place.  Making dinner reservations online was a breeze and the service was phenomenal.  We walked in (15 minutes before our reservation) and were seated immediately.  Within a minute, water and bread was on the table.  Our server was prompt and friendly, while still allowing us enough time to look over the menu.  He checked back often, but not so often as to disrupt the meal.  Our glasses were always full and the food came quickly.    The food was pretty good.  We both ordered a side salad and the 12-oz rib eye entree with chipotle caramelized onions, jack cheese potatoes and roasted corn with green chilies.  I really enjoyed the bread (if you don't like garlic, pass on the bread) and we both LOVED the side salad.  The potatoes and corn garnish were both very good and complimented the meal well.  You could see the corn was cut off the cob, and not from a can.  As for the steak, I'm fortunate to have a dad who is a master griller so when I have steak, I'm used to VERY, VERY GOOD steak.  Like, exceptionally good.  The steak here was tender, cooked just like I asked, but just not as flavorful as what I'm used to.  It was good, not great.  8/10.  All in all, I enjoyed this place.  The service was good, ambiance the ambiance was nice, and the food met expectations.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"You can only hope that, on every vacation or long business trip, you will have at least one simply wonderful meal.  On my recent trip to the nearby Boulders resort, our dinner at Cartwright's was the one.  Everything we had was somewhere between \"very good\" and \"amazing\", with the \"Cheyenne Indian Buffalo & Chipotle Sausage\" appetizer, the buffalo tenderloin and the cinnamon ice cream with homemade peanut brittle being the real standouts.    I suspect we may have been served by the same waitress that \"Nathan L.\" (in a previous review) was served by.  She did seem a little high-strung and humorless for the job, but she did her job well enough and her co-workers were all excellent."}
{"text":"There were 8 in our party and our night didn't start off very well because there were small pieces of broken glass on our table. When I notified our waitress she looked at the table like I didn't know what I was talking about.  Now about our Terrible meals we ordered. 3 of us ordered the beef brisket. I tasted my wife's and none of us liked the sauce they put on it. My friend ordered the so called Quail on a bed of Mac and Cheese. Where do I begin to say all the wrongs things about his dish. Lets just say He was not happy at all. The presentation of the dish didn't even look appetizing, and the quail looked like a mashed piece of meat. His wife ordered the best looking dish, and it wasn't even on the menu. Apparently they changed the menu a few months ago and had to ask for a special order. She had the fried scallops and scalloped potatoes. That looked the best out of all of our orders. My son ordered the Jidori Chicken, there were 2 tiny pieces of the smallest chicken I have ever seen. That was another dish that really didnt even look appetizing.  And I ordered the Rib-eye steak. This place used to be a steak house and with the steak that I got, you would think it came from Walmart. My mashed potatoes were bland and dry with no flavor so I used my friends melted butter to kind of dress it up. I am giving it a 1 star for the small side salad I paid 9.50 extra for. Needless to say we will not be going back there, and with the menu selection, I don't believe this place will last much longer, unless they survive off of the snow-birds that don't know any better about this terrible place."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the change of menu. Being able to customize your protein with the different styles offered or different combinations of sauces with veg and starch of choice was the best part of this restaurant and something I looked forward to each time. They're accommodating and can still do a lot of their original menu preparations, but it's just not the same. May have lost some loyal patrons. Please change your menu back!"}
{"text":"I liked the country feel of this restaurant.  The service w a s a little slow....our server took forever to even take our orders.....but the food was not affected by this. My filet was prepared exactly as I ordered it....medium rare. It was mouth-watering. Great choice by a friend....looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Very happy to say we'll be back. Again. Our server Debbie was a doll & very knowledgeable about the menu. On this occasion  our group of 5 enjoyed the sashimi spoons, wagyu tatare, and filets.  I read that the restaurant has new owners since our visit in November, 2017, and things may have changed."}
{"text":"A friend was visiting and we wondered into Cartwright's during happy hour.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed oysters, sliders, and a really nice $5.00 merlot.  The bartender was excellent, she kept an eye on us as the place filled up.  I really like the western interior, its comfortable and the lighting makes it cozy."}
{"text":"One of our very favorite places to go eat - in the Phoenix area and in general. I love the ambiance, patio is great, service is outstanding and the food is always perfect. I think I could live on their steaks and creamed corn!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends and it was a nice dining experience. Food was good, great bread, portions generous. The 8 oz filet which was perfectly cooked and very tender, the leek and Gorgonzola fondue was was light and a perfect compliment to the meat. I substituted the hash browns for the sweet potato hash, very tasty, had corn and a few crunchy tortilla chips mixed in, the brocollini was perfectly cooked, still a little crunchy. My husband had the trio of tacos which he really liked and said two could have sufficed. Our friends had the burger which he enjoyed and she had the tortilla soup which she also enjoyed but thought it wasn't as good as the one Carefree Station used to serve. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Good food but cranky bartender who felt insulted that he had to serve us - and ultimately didn't after a long dinner."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. My server, Martin, was excellent and was one of the best I have ever had. He really seemed to care that everyone have a great experience and enjoy their meal. He went above and beyond. The food was very well cooked. It was my birthday and restaurant week. The price for food was great for the amount on the plate. I wish there was a little more variety with their drink menu though. Overall, a great experience. If you go, ask for Martin."}
{"text":"Cartwrights is a nice getaway restaurant that has a whole lot of Southwestern / Romantic Ambiance. Its sits in the heart of the neat western town of Cave Creek and is a hidden gem if you ask me . The Prices are moderate , in fact I think the steaks are better than most Hoity Toity Steak houses , plus you get two sides and choice of sauces. The wine and cocktail list is excellent . It's an institution for us when we have family in town. Plenty of options for everyone and you will not be disappointed. My most favorite is the lobster, its prepared to easily eat and served with a beautiful Beurre Blanc. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Last Saturday we had an exceptional dinner here.  We made happy hour at 4:20; and in addition to  excellent wines we had Tuna Tartare; and, calamari appetizers.   For dinner I had their ELK TENDERLOIN STEAK.  It was from New Zealand, of all places!  It was the best steak Elk or otherwise that I have ever had.  It was tasty; and very tender.   My wife had the beef Filet steak.. She said it was  excellent. Our waitress was Mary Louise who could not have benn more attentive to all my many requests!   In my opinion this is THE BEST RESTAURANT NORTH OF CAREFREE HWY!  And, by far the best restaurant for steaks, seafood, or anything else in Scottsdale, Carefree, or Cave Creek.  sincerely,  Ed Altman Jr"}
