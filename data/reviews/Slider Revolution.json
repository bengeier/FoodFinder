{"text":"Now let's talk about the consumables. Despite SR taking on what I called a more take-out vibe, I was pleased (for my parents sake, really), that they indeed were licensed to serve. Selection is limited to a few bottled beers and wines, but they had Mill St Organic on offer,  so everyone was content. Food wise, the menu is vast and large, with burgers, pulled pork/ chicken, meatballs and more \"premium\" creations. It took me a while to decide, but in the end I just went with my instinctive cravings and the result was pretty good. This is what I tried:  Prime Rib Meatball stuffed with smoked cheddar, topped with caramelized onions, and tomato relish ($4.00)   Both of us who tried this one really enjoyed it. The meat was moist and substantial, and concealed a luscious ball of smokey cheddar that oozed out upon biting in. Unfortunately, I wasn't crazy about the relish, which I found a bit unbalanced. All I could taste was sweet on sweet, screaming for a splash of acidity and pepper to temper that sweetness out. I also wound have considered adding some type of aioli or spread onto the bun, because that little bit of relish didn't really add enough moisture to carry the entire bite beyond dry-ville. Despite this comment, here I should mention that all of the buns were really fresh and delicious. They were fluffy, well toasted, and held up to the moisture and weight of even the sloppiest of sliders. I would love to know where these can be purchased, because I love making mini-sandwiches at home.  Classic BBQ pulled pork with house made BBQ sauce, topped with house slaw ($3.75)   For those who just want a safe choice, this is a good one. With the exception of a little piece of grissle, the texture of the meat was nice, but the flavours all seemed a little reserved to me.  Mu Shu pulled pork with hoisin sauce, topped with Asian slaw and wonton crisps ($3.75)   This was my favourite that I sampled all night. Again, we got that really delicious pork, with a sweet and aromatic hoisin, a fresh crisp slaw and the deliciously salty crunch of the wontons. I think that sometimes the spicing of hoisin sauce can be overwhelming to some, but there was just enough on it that it was saucy, moist and bright, without drowning the flavour of the meat.   Philly Steak shaved AAA prime rib beef topped with provolone, peppers and onions and horseradish slaw ($4.50)   This was good but not my favourite. The beef was tender and well seasoned, and the cheese was deliciously melted, but I didn't really detect enough horseradish in my slaw to call it a really flavourful compact bite. Actually, what I was mainly detecting was the mild creaminess of the cheese. Not a bad thing to taste, of course, but I was expecting just a little more kick. Also, because it lacked the sauce most of the other sliders featured, it also was a little on the dry side.  Spicy Jerk pulled chicken topped with mango slaw and honey sriracha sauce ($4.00)   I just tried a little of the chicken, which didn't land this slider on my re-hit list. Sure, the chicken was moist and tender, and the level of heat was certainly there, but otherwise, the flavours were just a little muddled for me.   BBQ Poutine with real cheese curds and topped with BBQ pulled pork ($4.49 for small)  This is a must order at SR and was no doubt the best thing I ate all night. I somehow managed to make it last from the time it arrived to when my parents received and finished their meals, and somehow, the fries stayed crisp. I don't know what they're coating these babies in or how they're preparing them. All I know is that they're my kinda fry. The have a wicked crunch and a soft pillowy interior, topped off with cheese curds and a huge helping of that tender and moist pork. Mmm.. and I really liked the sauce/gravy they had going on. If you've ever been to Haugens out in Durham region (woah, there- blast from the past), it tasted a bit like their chicken dipping sauce (which I may or may not have been known to drink). Whether you know that flavour or not, you need to get these in your mouth today.   House Slaw side ($2.95)   Maybe this slaw was part of the reason I wasn't excited by the Classic BBQ slider. While I appreciated that it was crunchy and thinly sliced, the dressing tasted a bit like diluted vinegar to me. I wanted more sugar, more pepper and even a little more salt.  Also sampled from my family's plates (see above for photos):  Bulgogi shaved AAA prime rib beef with Korean BBQ sauce, topped with house slaw (mom wasn't sure she'd like the Kimchee slaw it came with) and spicy red pepper aioli ($4.50)  Again, I just sampled a taste of the meat, but this time, it got my attention. Nice balance of sweet, and savoury flavours, with just enough cover to keep everything  moist. I definitely will want to try this one full force (with the listed kimchee slaw) on a re-peat S..."}
{"text":"The combo I got was two regular sliders (Italian meatball, classic BBQ), one side (Yukon gold potato chips) and a can of pop for about $12 after tax.  The sliders were alright, the chips were OK.  This visit was in November, and at that time the kitchen seemed to be a bit unorganized (inexperienced?).  Two people were working in the kitchen, and there was one group of about eight people, a smaller table, myself (waiting for takeout), and two others waiting for takeaway.  I was told to wait 15 to 20 minutes.  At the larger table, half of the people had finished their food or were still picking away, while the other half was still waiting to get theirs.  In the end, my wait was about 20 minutes for just two sliders.  The two people in the kitchen seemed to be scrambling to keep up.  I'll give this place another shot in a few months. Hopefully by then they will have the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"While I think the kitchen is still working out its kinks in that the service was unusually slow when I went to check it out, I think Slider Revolution is a brilliant addition to the Danforth.  They have a variety of sliders to choose from and have divided them between regular and premium sliders.  I tried the prime rib slider, which was excellent, and also the cheese slider, which was less so, if only because it felt like I overpaid for a small sandwich filled with what tasted like monterey jack cheese.  My partner tried the meatball slider which was really yummy.  I loved the home made potato chips that came with the meal.  They also have a really good combo deal, where for 10 bucks, you get 3 sliders, a choice of sides, and a pop.  All in all, it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I went by today as we were walking around.  We went and got a combo to share; 1 regular slider, 1 premium slider, a side, and a can of pop.  We ordered a spicy jerk slider, a bulgogi slider, and a side of regular fries - it came to $13 all in.  The spicy jerk was quite tasty, a nice kick to it, however I like spicy and I would have preferred a little more spice.  The bulgogi was amazing, I'm Korean and I have to say the flavour was pretty spot on, there was a little bit of radish kimchi in there; very good.  The fries were FRESH and tasty.  After reading through the reviews I just realized they have five spice sweet potato fries; must go back to try them.  All in all a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Live just around the corner was was really excited for this. Overall, I enjoyed the sliders I had. The Al Pastor was amazing and I suggest it if you go.   Haven't been back since, though, due to the price. For two of us (5 sliders total) it felt a bit like price-gouging. Especially with Square Boy down the way still slinging burgers old-school.  A slight adjustment in price may make all the difference, because right now it's a \"take visitors when in town\" sort of place, not a \"too lazy to cook Tuesday night\" joint."}
{"text":"My friends and I went this past weekend to the grand opening of Slider Revolution.  Overall, it's a refreshing addition to the Danforth and the Toronto food scene.    The wide \"not your everyday\" slider selection which includes lamb, prime rib, pulled pork and even brunch options satisfied my group of friends various taste preferences.  The sweet potato and yukon gold chips were a nice complement as a side.  We will definitely be going back to try other menu items!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Mu Shu and Bulgogi sliders and they exceeded my expectations.  The won ton crisps were a nice addition to the Mu Shu and the Bulgogi had a nice spice kick to it.  The serving size was just right for lunch.  I even had a chance to try their brunch recently and again, I thought their food was excellent quality.  The Smoked Salmon brunch slider was fresh and tasty and their Buttermilk Pancakes were light and fluffy.    Service was quick and friendly.  The owner was very nice and chatted with the young family who had come in for brunch.  Good to see a family-friendly restaurant in the 'hood.  The restaurant is casually decorated and very clean which scores top points.   Given that the place just recently opened, I'm surprised the other reviewers gave such poor reviews.  Any new business will experience growing pains!  I plan on coming back with my friends soon."}
{"text":"The sweet potato chips were mostly burned, and the few that weren't didn't taste that great - but that might just be because sweet potato chips aren't a great idea.  The sliders we tried (a philly cheesesteak minus the cheese and relish, so just a regular burger, and a pulled pork slider) were OK, but nothing inspired.  The service was the worst part of the experience - the owner was very nice, but a group of 4 people who came in after we finished ordering managed to get in their order and were well into their meal by the time ours was ready. There was only one cook manning the grill, we waited 30 minutes, and we were served out of order. Not a place we'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"I'll open by saying that I really wanted to love this place. Who doesn't love sliders? And the attention paid to customers by the owner was amazing. Alas, what really matters, the food, underwhelmed.  Having visited a couple of times now and trying a few of the different sliders (the crab cake was amazing... But I'm partial to crab cakes, so my opinion doesn't count) they were mostly just OK. The price points just didn't justify the taste for me. I don't mind paying but it's got to be worth it. As it stands I'd rather just walk down the street to the Works for my fancy burger fix.   Another small annoyance was the wait time on the sliders, I get that it's a small kitchen with only two people cooking, but waiting 25 or more minutes for 2 sliders is just too long.   Again, I want to love this place but needs work on the price points (maybe 3 sliders in stead of 2?) a few tweaks for the sliders themselves, and I think this place can be great."}
{"text":"Came here during Burger Week for two sliders for $5. I was scared that they would be small but they are a perfect size for a medium eater like me.   Tried their Kimchi burger which seemed similar to their Bulgolgi burger. It was excellent. The Nacho slider was not so good, with pulled pork that was dry. It might have been better with melted cheese instead of the cold shredded cheese   The place is nice, but simple and cafeteria looking.  There's lots of space to sit and also a back patio which we did not get to see this visit. First day of burger week and from 12 to 1 there were only 2 parties, us included. I was surprised and wonder what their normal business is like.  I also got a side of the sweet potato fries (the best I've ever had - but coated with some sort of flour, then deep fried - would check if you're gluten free). It was expensive for a side at $4.50 and not that much.   Would I come back here on a regular day? Maybe, the prices are a bit steep for a small little thing for $4-5. They do offer a good combo (two for $10 plus side and drink) which is nice. In addition, the slider menu is different from your typical beef, lettuce, tomato fare.  But something in the burger sat in the bottom of my stomach for the rest of the day. Even with fatty goodness from burgers priest, it's not that bad or that long. Just saying."}
{"text":"We stopped in today, this is a new place (replaced Threes Company) and the food was really good, the service was super friendly too. I am a Tuesday regular up the road at the Eton House (Comedy) and the dining options were quite limited, but I really liked everything we ordered, so I'm pretty sure I will become a regular.  I had the Al Pastor Slider and a side of Poutine.  The Al Pastor was good, it was spicy pulled pork, and some sort of slaw. There was a lot of meat for a slider. The poutine was really good too, fresh made (even the gravy)  My girlfriend had 2 hamburger sliders with sweet potato fries (and a side of garlic aoli) The burgers were good, the sweet potato fries were fantastic.  I am looking forward to returning, I want to try the meatball slider soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sliders and the service was friendly. I called ahead as I was coming during brunch hours but did not want brunch, they had no problem with that, they even served me at the table, but did mention next time would have to get counter service, not sure why but whatever.  The food was good, I do prefer two bite saloon, but slider revolution is closer to me, so when I'm feeling lazy and in the mood for sliders or mini burgers I will stop in.  Hope they can improve the decor of the place as it's fairly bland."}
{"text":"Thank your preferred deity, these sliders are heavenly.    Fast-ish food on the Danforth has been a slog the last couple years, with gyros and pizza the only reliable options.  I had a jerk chicken and meatball slider.  Totally different flavour combinations, and each sang totally different and totally sweet notes.  The sauces, toppings, and meat were awesome.  As were the buns... perfectly toasted.  Fries were excellent (I had the regular ones, not sweet potato). Only other place in the neighbourhood for a better burger than McDs/Licks is Burger Stomper, and I've had mixed bag of experiences there.  I really hope this place makes it. The location is just east of Pape about a block away from the really hopping stretch of Danforth. Worried the crowds might overlook it."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for Burger Week.  We ordered 1 of each.  The Asian Burger was the tastiest in my opinion.  The Nacho one was ok.  2 sliders is surprisingly filling.   We were lucky to be able to participate, we got the last burgers for the day, then they were all sold out.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Refreshing addition to the Danforth & Pape scene, glad to see businesses are slowly revitalizing the area...  We tried four sliders but liked the premium prime rib sliders the best. The portions aren't huge but again, you have to remember they are sliders.. The owner gave us a sampling of the regular potato chips and we had purchased the sweet potato chips after the owner talked us into it.  The sweet potato chips are unique but we preferred the regular potato chips."}
{"text":"A foodie I may not be, but I know good food when I taste it and Slider Revolution delivered!   I took a couple of items from the premium menu -- the bulgogi and the crab cake -- and while the crab cake definitely tasted like a crab cake on a bun (nothing wrong with that; it's precisely what I asked for), the bulgogi BLEW MY MIND. Korean BBQ in a slider is going to be my new addiction -- SO SAVOURY!  Slider Revolution's been in town for a couple of months, and I think you need to get up on it. The Beef from the East is JUST the meal you've been looking for!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spin on a burger place; in a market that is overrun with \"gourmet\" burger places. It seems like Toronto gets a new \"gourmet\" burger place every month. I love that you can get sliders and mix up your burger experience by not just having one burger that is all the same. There is also a huge variety of different sliders, as well as a variety of different coleslaws, which is refreshing to see compared to the old burgers and fries.  A lot of reviews referred to the sliders being small, but I find that to be a little unfair. Put two sliders together and you pretty much have a burger. I found the size to be adequate. I think the price is reasonable as well, because if you were going to food truck, they would be charging 8 dollars for 2 sliders too. And honestly, these sliders are way tastier than any of the ones I've had from a food truck.  I shared the pulled pork slider combo, with mango slaw. And we each had a Bulgogi slider. The pulled pork was moist, but without being overly sauced. It also had a nice spice to it. The Bulgogi slider had a unique flavour, which I really enjoyed. The only thing I was say is that it was a little salty. So if you don't like salty food, don't get the Bulgogi. Though I personally loved it and would get it again.  I liked it. I would totally go back and try some new sliders!"}
{"text":"VIBE  What was once Three's Company, the brunch place, is now Slider Revolution. It's a bit bare bones at the moment and I hope they brighten up the place. I think it would make it more welcoming. That said, they've only been open a little over a month.   I ATE  The food is really great here! I like the slider idea because you can get it as a filling snack or you can have two and a side for a combo to make a meal out of it. These guys are using more meats than just hamburger unlike their competitors. I really enjoyed the lamb slider. The Italian meatball was really great as well. The tomato basil soup was simple. I hope that they mix it up and add more exciting soup flavours to the mix. That said, I like that they have the option of soup in addition to fries or chips.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I'm not sure it's exactly a \"revolution\" but the Danforth has been needing something new other than a yogurt place for a while. Kudos! PS it's not even a three minute walk from Pape Subway station."}
