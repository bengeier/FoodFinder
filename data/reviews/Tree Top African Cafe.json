{"text":"After some careful deliberation, I selected this place as the location of an important platonic date. I was not disappointed.  The delightfully pleasant server explained the origins of all the different foods and pointed us towards the goat. Goat?! I'd never eaten that before. I needed to try it.  My platonic friend ordered the sample platter with fish, beef, chicken, and goat. I ordered the fou fou with goat stew. All the food was great, with lots of fragrant spices and very tender stewed meat. The fou fou was a big hit with me. Essentially, it comes as a large globe of thick mashed potato. Thick enough to break off a piece and dip into the stew -- very filling and comforting!  I highly recommend this place. It also looks nice a place to have a coffee and that's next on my list."}
{"text":"Yum yum. I've been to Tree Top many times as I live just around the corner and am never disappointed. The coffee, espresso based or brewed, is some of the best in the market especially their rotating selection of African beans.   I loove the goat meat stew which is always tender, I usually have it with jollof rice though the fufu is good too. I believe the meal usually comes with a stew (meat or vegetarian options are there) rice and salad. Don't forget to use the homemade hot sauce sparingly. Their fish cakes make a nice quick snack along with their homemade ginger beer.   I love the location as the big windows make it a really nice place to sit for a while. The service is great and the woman who usually works is very nice. Sometimes the owner, who also owns the very cool  drum shop next door comes in to greet the customers.   Very delicious home made African Food!"}
{"text":"I was craving some West African food and this place seriously hit the spot. I am sure that I looked like a human vacuum cleaner as I ate the delcious meal of jallof rice and peanut sauce.  I'm from Ghana so sometimes I get these days where I feel like having my mom's jallof rice and amazing goodness. The food was made with so much love and I felt like I was having a homecooked meal.  This is absolutley one of my favorite spots in the city. When those cravings come back for some good West African food, I know exactly where to go!"}
