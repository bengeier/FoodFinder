{"text":"The food is poor.  The seasonings in the sauce do not taste anything like what I grew up with in my Italian home!   The bread was stale and the meat sauce was sour.   I feel I have given this restaurant a fair chance.  My husband and I have eaten there three times.  MT"}
{"text":"Oh my god. Just don't go here. Had a reservation for 6:30, didn't get food until 8. Didn't get the check till 9. I have never experienced such aggravatingly SLOW service. Must have been one guy in the kitchen.   Don't even get me started on the food. Extremely bland. DEFINITELY wasn't worth it, SUPER OVERPRICED.   Still ripping my eyeballs out in frustration!!!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional! The Marinara sauce is absolutely delicious! It's not in the best location, hard to find. I understand that they are moving to a better location, so that problem will be solved. I hope they hang on to very homey atmosphere in the new restaurant. I look forward to finding out. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and dogs are allowed on patio. The service was very good and the bread and oil is to die for. I highly recommend trying this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Ate here about a week ago & Im STILL thinking about it!  Marco the waiter is so awesome you'll wish you could take him home.  The food was unreal. Absolutely mouth watering, incredible, blew me away. No joke, no exaggeration. With so many Italian restaurants around it is mind blowing when you eat at one that actually reminds you of when you were in Europe. Seriously dense hazelnut chocolate cheesecake that took me two days to eat! Is it possible it tasted even better the second day? Yes.  The atmosphere, music, ambiance all fantastic. Like being in a real italian family's house instead of a chain restaurant with decor that's trying to emulate it. I adore all the pictures. Even have super cute & very clean restroom.  Impecable service.   I am so glad I checked this place out. It might not seem obvious from the outside, its in a shopping center but this place is a true gem.  Yummy oh man soOo yummy! Go & check it out"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place. I had high expectations after reading all of the reviews and reading the website and was really let down.   First lets start with the service, 15 minutes to get a cup of water, 15 more minutes to order, server doesn't ask how your meal is....  With a restaurant this size tucked away in a residential area they should be busting their ass to get all the business they can.   Even though there are not a ton of great Italian restaurants in Vegas I would stay away from this one. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"I thought this little place was pretty good! I had the Mediterranean Chicken which was wonderful, we also shared stuffed mushrooms, & fried artichoke hearts for appetizers. Prices are also good. The only reason i give 3 stars is because they did not have a full bar (just select wines & beer) and the fried artichoke was a little tough and lacked a sauce so we ended up poring the balsamic vinegar for the bread onto it. I would definitly recommend this place though. Very nice for a quiet dinner for 2."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The new location is larger and accommodates more diners, reducing wait time. A wonderful place to dine."}
{"text":"They advertise a happy hour, but recently i am told by the bartender oh we dont do rhat anymore!!?? Why oh why have a great hh menu to get people in, and  then change  the menu a few months later!!?? Annie answer me that! I shop nearby and  see a very slow restaurant!!!! Somerimes people rhat can cook well, have ni idea how ro run a restaurant!! Also when i go in bar alone ro small table unprofessional bartender he always asks me are you alone? Good grief why is he even asking me that if I am expecting another I will let you know I have been widowed for 2 years now and never felt so depressed as I got up and left the other night as their happy hour had stopped and the bartender made me feel unwanted since I was dining alone get a clue people"}
{"text":"Love this place. Particularly the hidden bar. This is a very non Vegas place. Bar tender remembers your fave drink and it feels like a 'local' place to be. Food is tasty and the staff are the same faces each time. Love being able to come to a place that I know people.  Very Italian welcoming feel. Great work guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and brought my dog to celebrate his birthday to have dinner and sit on the patio. Yes, my therapist is well employed. Sat outside with the pup and some family and got a few dishes to pass around family style. The chicken Marsala was excellent and I thought the baked penne pasta was pretty good as well.  Service was great and waitress even put a candle on the pupper's dessert. For our dessert we had the canoli and they were for sure enough to make me come by just to grab some of those! The price was good and I'll be sure to visit them when they move to their new location."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write about how great this place is for fear it might get too busy and I'll have to wait hours for a table.  Annie's is a wonderful neighborhood bistro. Not a lot of indoor seating, but there is a nice outdoor patio that would be great on a nice day. We started with meatball scampi. I would come back just for this! Take a bite with a bite of bread! Yum! Then we ordered the lasagne, baked rigatoni and the spagetti and meatballs for the kids. Large portions, fresh flavors and nothing but delicious!   Having Annie come by our table and saying hello was a very nice touch also.  We'll definitely be back, next time with our pooch to try out the dog menu."}
{"text":"New location provides lots of parking and a large outside area to eat with your pooch. Inside is a craftily hidden bar area with 3 TVs where one can celebate without disturbing patrons in the restaurant proper, which is very tastefully furbished.  My meal started with fresh rolls to be dipped in oil & vinegar + chopped olives and garlic. Main course was chicken piccata with angel hair pasta = superb. The 2 chicken breasts were large, freshly purchased and so tender I cut them solely with my fork. For dessert I had spumoni ice cream in a graham cracker bowl, topped with whipped cream and drizzles of chocolate and raspberry. A cup of coffee with Amoretto liqueur finished the meal.  The server Linda was very friendly and attentive. In summation, I rate Annie's at its new location with straight A's for location, ambiance, quality of food, service and price."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The food is amazing and Gio the bartender is awesome. I eat at this place at least 1 time a week. Best pasta in the city. Amazing service and they give you plenty of food! Good price and happy hour is from 4-7. You must check this place out. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for Italian, and we like to support local businesses when possible, so we tried Annie's Gourmet Italian. Unfortunately, we didn't check Yelp first! We both said the same thing when we walked out - that was literally our worst dining experience ever (and we eat out - a lot.). The bread was days old, reheated and mealy. The chicken that my husband ordered was flat, overcooked, tasteless, and rubbery. My shrimp scampi was nearly identical - tasteless, rubbery, and not at all appetizing. I could have made a much better meal in my kitchen. Our server was great, and we tipped him well for his service. However, for $100, we could have spent our money elsewhere and been much more satisfied. We won't be heading back here, ever.   Also, after reading the constructive criticisms from others on this establishment, we've concluded that if Annie would spend as much time in the kitchen improving her dishes(using all of this feedback) as she does responding negatively to everyone who clearly had the same experience we had, this restaurant might survive."}
{"text":"This place was truly amazing! We stopped in for lunch during the week.  From the minute I walked in I was wooed!  The restaurant is tucked inside a shopping center next to Smith store, and although not the ideal place for such a great little authentic place, the inside of the place takes you to another world.  The food was just as amazing!  Let me say the BEST eggplant dish I have ever had! For appetizers we tried the couplets of stuff mushrooms and meatballs, both very delicious!  The meatballs were perfectly spiced!  My other half had the Veal Parmesan with red sauce ...the meat was tender but the wasn't the biggest fan of red sauce. We also had a side of Italian Gnocchi's in a pink sauce...delicious!  The place it's self has pictures of the chef's grandparents and childhood growing up in New York, great touch! Over this was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service great pricing. Extra note left my jacket at the restaurant. The staff took their time to let me know great customer service."}
{"text":"Best veal piccata in town!  Everything is cooked to order, so can take time, but worth the wait.....the hidden bar is cool.  Waiting for it to heat up to bring the dogs to the out door patio.  When my parents visit, Annie's is the first place they want to go.  Great atmosphere and the staff and owners are genuinely  nice people."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal today at Annie's. Service was excellent. The ambiance is excellent. Four of us enjoyed a variety of dishes - all prepared and seasoned expertly. Annie's stays on our list as our favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent everything was great from the abvionce, food wine waiters definetly will be returning  truly a fabulous experience ."}
{"text":"My favorite local Italian restaurant in Henderson. I love their fettuccine alfredo w/chicken.  Actually everything I've tried there has been great!  The service is great too! And they support animal rescue! :)"}
{"text":"Generally it's very good. I ordered veal marsala. The source is very tastey. I just wish the veal can be a bit softer. Will definitely come again and try other options"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Annie's if you're looking for some home cooked Italian food. It never disappoints and the whole staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's local and not a chain restaurant like so many places out here. I have been three times, and it is just not great. I have tried various items off of their menu, and nothing stood out to me. I love anything with mushrooms, so I ordered the stuffed mushroom appetizer, and all I could really taste was very very chewy mushrooms with what seemed to be a hint of freezer burn? They truly tasted like they had been previously frozen. As far as the service goes, it isn't super friendly, which really doesn't bother me too too much if the food is good, but there really is not much redeeming about this place, and the prices are a bit expensive as well. They also are not super kid-friendly in case you are planning on bringing children. They  seemed a bit annoyed that we brought my 2 year old who is very well-behaved and does not make a mess at all or cry or scream in restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has gotten some bad reviews. The food has a fresh, unprocessed flavor to that some may not be used to. Their eggplant parm was amazing. Yes their food takes longer to prepare probably b/c they don't take short cuts like microwaves. I love the small intimate setting, available outdoor seating and best of all it's super close to my house. I have never had problems with poor service. Due to the small size of the place they could easily become overwhelmed so as someone else said I almost hate to give them props as they seem to be a hidden gem for now."}
{"text":"Hard to find parking. The place was clean and nice looking. The food was not so good.  My Appetisers tasted like Any ol' bar food.  We had a party of 8 and no one was thrilled with their food.  Funny thing was.... We had heard such good things about this place?  2 days later my client told me she ate there with her husband and they also did not enjoy their food.  So sad :("}
{"text":"The food is great, and I particularly love the meat sauce. My daughter said her gnocchi was the best she ever had. What I love most is the very friendly staff and family atmosphere. From the owners coming out to greet you and the family photos, this is a place where you feel like \"everybody knows your name.\""}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this place but basically ended up in a diner with a fake Italian atmosphere. Actually we'd have been better off in a diner...at least there we expect canned sauce and bad presentation at better prices. Disappointing. Next time I'll head down the road to Buon Gusto - way better food, better prices and NYC style Italian atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant since it is close to home. This is my second visit and the stars are for this visit.  On my first visit, the owner was at the restaurant and the service and food were good. Tonight, horrible...no owner present. We arrived at 7pm and did not get our entrees until 8:15. They were out of the stuffed mushrooms, which is the signature dish. The shrimp scampi is supposed to come with angel hair, but they substituted spaghetti. When we asked the waiter, he said they were out of angel hair. The bread was hard on the bottom, similar to the when you have old rolls and microwave it and it gets hard. The food was very bland, lots of garlic but no flavor. The people that I dined with said that they were there last week and they were out of shrimp scampi. It's very disappointing to go to a restaurant and service is painfully slow, menu items are not available and the food quality is not consistent."}
{"text":"I can't even remember how good the food was but I was blown away by the service and the attention that my dog got!  They have doggy meals that even end with ice cream, my dog never wants to eat at home again."}
{"text":"Great ambience.  Nice staff. Service is very slow.  We waited over 40 minutes for our food from the time we ordered.  The food was tasteless when it finally came.  I'll keep driving down the street until I get to the Pasta Shop next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go here and eat at the bar. It is quiet, classy, and friendly. Artichokes and stuffed mushrooms are the best in town. Then we split a main course and that is plenty. Our go to when too tired or stressed to cook. Always awesome."}
{"text":"We love Annie's!! My husband and I take our dog with us to dinner. The food is excellent and everyone there is so nice. We try to go once every couple weeks when the weather permits. Great food. Great staff. Great service."}
{"text":"If I could rate less than 1 star I would!!! This place was TERRIBLE from the Waite staff to the food.. We went there on a recommendation so I had high hopes. Being Italian from NY we know good food. This place would not last 1 day in my hometown, and I am surprised they are still in business here..So our adventure begins: I made reservations for 11 people for 6:30 on a Saturday night. I was excited when we arrived as every booth was filled. So i thought they would live up to the recommendation!!! It took them 15 minutes to seat us after our reservation time, and then another 15 minutes for us to get one drink. One hour ( Yes hour) later , and after 3 kind reminders to our waitress, we finally got bread on our table.. Her last excuse was that she was ''working on it''. I finally saw a busboy and asked him to get us some bread.  Well, the bread was a cold roll, not the advertised Italian bread we were expecting. Another 30 minutes and they FINALLY took our appetizer and dinner order. Waitress recommended that we order them together to make sure we got fed.. Another 30 minutes and the appetizers arrived.. They were cold and seemed of the pre packaged frozen variety.. All along no one EVER came to our tables to see how we were doing.. One hour later( yes hour), and after most of the patrons were gone, our food came out.. #1-- it was cold. #2--it was lousy,,Ragu has better sauce, pasta was overdone, veal was tough, and I have NO idea what they were trying to pass off as chicken parmigiana!!  We had to beg them for cheese on our table. The waitress placed the wrong orders in front of 2 of my family members.. They did not realize it until they had taken a bite, and she had the nerve to blame us because my husband asked her to skip over him during the ordering process so he could decide what he wanted. Said because he skipped, it threw her off.. REALLY!!! WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER AND TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE $420 we spent!!!  You would think with a large party the chef or maitre d would come and ask how everything was.. Nope, just par for the course.. DO NOT EAT HERE. MAYBE THEY WILL GET THE PICTURE AND HIRE PROFESSIONAL WAITE STAFF AND A REAL CHEF WHO CAN COOK ITALIAN!!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly waiter - the chicken Parmesan wasn't all that but my girlfriend had the chicken Marsala and was good.  I recommend they improve their table bread and use fresh grated Parmesan cheese for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the bad reviews.  The food was delicious and the staff was very attentive.  Our waiter, Steve was very personable and attentive.  Annie came out and stopped by every table to say hello and ask how everyone was doing.   There appeared to be some regulars in there because the staff recognized them.    We almost didn't go because of the reviews but several people we know told us they liked it a lot and the RJ's food critic gave it an \"A\" review so we took a chance and I'm sure glad we did!  It's our new favorite restaurant.    My husband had the fettuccini and said it was very good.  I had the chicken marsala and it was good also.  The rice ball was great, the salad very good and the cannoli I had was one of the best that I have had in Vegas.   My husband said the tiramisu was very good.  I loved their red sauce because it was similar to my family's recipe.    The restaurant is very quaint (about 12 tables) and almost  1/2 were occupied.  Everyone was seated promptly and no one waited long to be served as some of the reviewers complained about.    She allows dogs out on the patio and has events to help them which is another reason I would patronize her restaurant.  I am an animal lover and like the fact she does that.  I also want to bring my dog when it warms up.  The patio does have a fireplace.    I would definitely recommend Annies.  Take a chance and go, you will be glad you did.  We were!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon deal and thought we'd give this a try.  The staff was very personable, attentive and pleasant. There was a relatively long wait for our food to arrive. The food itself was good but didn't set itself apart significantly from other Italian restaurants. As someone else said, 'gourmet' is pushing it.   For what we got, the price was a bit high - ~$50 for two entrees and cokes.  The place is pretty small so consider making a reservation at peak times."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily Ordinary: We went mid week and it may have been an off night, however ... Excellent service, pricy bar and menu, and not so good meal. Meatballs were small, dense and dry. Chicken Mediterranean was overlooked, tuff, and dry. Garlic overpowered sauces and seasonings. The Lemon cake was excellent, but the Tiramisu was bland."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Annie's last night.  It is a neighborhood gem.  The hidden bar is a great place to meet with friends for a before or after dinner drink. Also for appetizers before dining outside.  ( the stuffed mushrooms were delicious, overstuffed with a perfectly seasoned sausage) Our bartender and server, Gio, was the best.  The patio is wonderful for dining this time of year while the weather is still pleasant for outdoor dining.  (Also one of the few dog friendly places in town)  I had dinner with a group of friends and we had a great time.  Everyone had something different and we all shared.  Everythng was delicious and the service was excellent.   They say that the best 3 words a customer can say is I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was legit authentic Italian and very delicious with large portions! Very nice and classy decor, you can tell the owner pays attention to detail. The server Louie was quick and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was horrible. DO NOT order any of the \"chicken\" dishes. It was flavorless & had a very odd texture...rubbery & just plain not appetizing.  The Caesar salad wasn't even that great.   My husband & I will not be returning to this establishment. The server was awesome though. Very accommodating."}
{"text":"Service was great, loved the outdoor patio where they allow dogs, but there was some inconsistency with the menu and a lack of seasoning on the pasta and vegetables in the pasta primavera I ordered. Loved the ceasar salad! But the menu says the pastas come with salad and garlic bread and when I asked about the garlic bread, I was told that no it didn't come with it... Hopefully if I go again I can ask for my pasta and vegetables to be salted during cooking..."}
{"text":"I rarely go to a restaurant that will have 2 stars or better yet a 1 star, because I've given restaurants that rating and I know what they are like... I've also trusted Yelpers to give good honest reviews because all of us are foodies and love good food... but I came to Annie's because it was recommended to me by a trusted friend... although her tastes are suspect at times... I decided to go there and see how \"bad\" or good this place is... I don't know if I was not expecting much because of the comments about the service and the food, but it really was not that bad... maybe the stars were in perfect alignment but my food and service was decent... really.  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, which were huge and full flavored.  Then I got the Rigatoni Roberta and the baked Lasagna... both were hot and delicious... Their Caesar salad was good also.  I enjoy the decor and the warm feeling of being at a family run restaurant was nice...  Annie was actually there along with her mom, who helps out too... I enjoyed the fact that there are businesses that are still run the old fashion way... I'm a little embarrassed to give this place such \"high\" marks, but for a first time experience it really wasn't that bad... I think I might come back if time permits... I thanked my friend for steering me here to Annie's because I wouldn't have come here if it weren't for her recommendation... my advice if you decide to come... expect two star service and be amazed at the food and the people there that actually give you two more stars of service and food!"}
{"text":"The front of house folks are amazingly nice, but unfortunately create a false expectation of what is to follow. First, their bread is awful for an Italian restaurant, like somebody grabbed a bag of week-old hard rolls at a grocery store. Second, although the restaurant was only half full at 6:30 dinner time (a bad sign by itself), it took the food forever to come out -- we told the waiter that we were about to walk after 40 minutes and numerous promises of imminent service, it was just that bad. When the food did come out, it was nothing to write home about and was remarkably bland; huge portions that you didn't want to take any of it home because it was about tasteless. Again, the folks there was very nice, but good service does not a bad experience overcome. Pass on Annies until they bring their food up to at least the same level as numerous other nearby Italian restaurants in Henderson which have slightly better prices. Note to Annies Management: Please, please swallow your pride and go hire a good modern Italian professional chef, because food that tastes like it was cooked by \"somebody's mom who dabbles in Italian cooking\" isn't keeping pace with your competition; oh, and kill the awful hard rolls and serve patrons freshly baked and warm Italian bread with herbs."}
{"text":"The star is for the server. When I go to a restaurant above all the food should be the star of the show. The food was mediocre at best. My children shared a $9.95 bowl of buttered spaghetti and received a cereal bowl of plain pasta, completely overpriced. Service took way to long, over an hour from appetizers to entrees. When the food did come out it was either half cold and rubbery (chicken). They ran out of wine that we ordered and gave us excuses that they were really busy. It was 8:00 and the restaurant was empty. We absolutely will not go back. Sad really, the neighborhood really welcomed a cool place to walk to and have good food."}
{"text":"Great food and an awesome atmosphere. Please try the lasagna if you want to have the best lasagna ever. We finished with the tiramisu which was the cherry on the top of an awesome meal."}
{"text":"So very yummy! Our server was really great about being on top of everything including refills. He was very knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Their new location is just wonderful! The food came in large portions and the flavor was incredible. Our server Lana was fantastic and on top of everything! A must try!"}
{"text":"This is my usual spot for dinner when I want to be close to home. Always a great meal and the staff is terrific."}
{"text":"Happy hours non noms. Shrimp scampi is awesome! Arancini di  ( oh forget it ... Ice balls are delish and again the shrimp scampi appetizer .... Freaking amazing! AGAIN!   Nutella cheesecake?  YES Next time with espresso please!"}
{"text":"Very loud establishment (and there were only 4-5 tables in there and I could barely hear my party at my table), so they should definitely figure out some way to help the acoustics. Unless you don't plan on talking / hearing your dinner party. Food also seemed to take a very long time, especially for how few parties were dining. I would be fearful when more than 20% of the dining room was filled as when we went. BUT, THE FOOD WAS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT!!!! Delicious homemade rolls, great ceasar salad (not overly dressed), excellent chicken and veal parmigiana. Every item we walked by on the way in and out of the restaurant looked fantastic. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"So a large group of us went last night to Annie's to eat on the patio what a fantastic time we had with all our friends eating Amazing italian food and great cocktails. The patio was packed with diners and their puppies having a wonderful night with friends and family I highly recommend this especially to pet owners where you can dine with your dog they even have pet meals I've been going there since they opened and I love it I am off on Fridays and Saturdays and usually hang out in the Lost weekend bar where you can hang out with Gio the bartender and still have great Italian food and it's a killer happy hour...way to go Annie"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I really want to like this place.  The atmosphere is good and both times I've been there the service has been great.  There's just one problem and that is that the food is just not very good.  ok, who am I kidding, the food sucks.  The first time I went there we got the rice balls and stuffed mushrooms.  They were pretty good.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad.  Now the second time we went there we got the Antipasto plate.  Screeching record.  This was THE most shoddy antipasto plate I've ever seen.  This is what it entails:  oscar meyer style HONEY ham and turkey lunch meat, the little round pepperoni's you get in a package to put on pizza, 2 slices of salami, 2 slices of provolone (sandwich slices), 2 medium roasted red peppers (obviously from a jar) and a few green olives and artichokes.  WHY, WHY, WHY, would you use cheap honey ham lunch meat on an antipasto platter???  So freaking gross.  Not to mention turkey too.  The cheap pepperoni?  What a joke.  Italy would be ashamed that they are calling themselves a \"gourmet Italian\" restaurant.  The bread they brought out was two measly sesame breadsticks.  Also blatantly cheap.  They never once asked if we wanted more bread and even if we had, I wouldnt have gotten it because it wasnt good.  If you call yourself a gourmet restaurant, have some good crusty Italian bread with butter.  Not some shitty stale sesame breadsticks.  Ok, on to the main courses.  My husband got a tortellini dish with alfredo sauce and chicken.  The chicken had been sliced up and been sitting out for a while because it was tough and dried up.  It had been mixed in with the alfredo to try and mask the fact, but who are they trying to fool??  The chicken should have been freshly grilled, julienned and place on top of the pasta with no sauce covering it.  The sauce itself was bland and from a jar.  Tri colored tortellini was standard.  I got rigatoni with meatballs.  The sauce is a chunky disgusting paste that has no good qualities to it whatsoever.  Please, if anyone from Annie's reads this, you MUST get a decent sauce.  Not chunky, not pasty, not blah!!  I think a good sauce is one of the most important aspects of an Italian restaurant.    Overall, this is a restaurant that has a lot of potential.  It is in a very nice area of Henderson.  However, the majority of people who live around there are most likely used to eating good quality food.  They will soon realize that Annie's is trying to be a place with good quality food, but it's not.  It's cheap, standard, straight from the box, straight from the general food supplier fare.  YAWN."}
{"text":"Oh goodness. Really wished the new location was going to change the service and maybe the menu or at least add some \"wow\" flavor to it. I don't want to knock Grandma's recipes but... Meh. So much space and now an actual bar! Still not used properly. The chicken is from Costco or Sam's club which is fine but do something with it! The \"mixed veggies\" were also from either establishment and totally bland as well. C'mon man.   The chef came out to a couple tables but not ours or I would've asked if there was going to be any updates coming (hopeful thinking). Doesn't seem to have kept the old folk crowd from showing up but if that's the crowd you're aiming for then fine but why move farther away from Macdonald Ranch?   Pro-tip: Update the menu and servers. Don't purchase your ingredients from Costco.   Also to the plate splitting charge.... Make the dishes BIGGER, then and ONLY then should you be allowed to enforce a plate splitting charge."}
{"text":"We really really want to give this place a better review! If you read the other reviews you'll see what we mean. By all means please try this place. It's NOT that the food is bad, far from but it's just NOT what you're thinking it's going to be. We went in (3rd time now) and the food just doesn't have the \"something special\" that if you open a dang restaurant it should have a certain flare to it. This place advertises \"Gma's recipes\" well I'm sorry but these recipes aren't that great.   On top of that the FOOD takes forever to come out. The wait staff is fine as far as we can tell but the kitchen seems to be the slow part.  From what we can tell this place stays afloat from the \"elderly population\" (the local area around the place). Which is unfortunate, this place could THRIVE!   as of 30 Jan 2014 they are opening a new location at Valle Verde & Paseo Verde in that shopping center. WHERE WILL PEOPLE PARK? Ugh."}
{"text":"Yesterday we had a Rosebowl Party, USC vs. Penn State.  This is the second time we have used Annie's Gourmet Italian to cater our party.  The food was spectacular; it was wonderful with rave reviews from our guests who plan to visit her restaurant if they have not as yet.  She set everything up and it was beautifully done.  If you want to see it just go to Facebook to Annies Gourmet Italian.  Whenever we have a party, small or large we have Annie's cater it and it is always to perfection.  Her assistant stays through the party and helps with serving and cleanup.  She was wonderful too!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't care for this overpriced Entree, Chicken Marsala. I get better Marsala and Chicken at The Cheesecake Factory. The Marsala sauce was extremely Sweet, overpowering any other flavors. Mushrooms were mediocre. My boyfriend tried it and he only ate one bite and said the chicken tastes and looks like frozen microwaved chicken. Sadly disappointed after originally ordering veal and they were out. Italians out of veal? Huh? That should've been the Red Flag. $20 No bueno"}
{"text":"As always Annie's delivers great food in a wonderful atmosphere. I am trying to lose a little weight so I have been getting the vegetables instead of pasta sauteed sometimes and steamed sometimes , they are very accommodating to my individual needs."}
{"text":"Last year we dined here for my grandpa's birthday and we loved it so much we decided to come back this year. This time we had my grandpa's nieces from Argentina in town to visit so as a happy reunited family we were pretty loud and the last to leave but our server Jim was patient, polite and there for us from Start to Finish! I personally had the Caprese salad, Chicken Picatta and Cheesecake. All meals were soooo delicious I was very satisfied with my selections. We mentioned it was my grandpas birthday and the manager came over with a birthday hat and cannoli! All staff members helped us take photos with our phones throughout the night. It's definitely a great restaurant to be with your family. My grandma and I hope to come back with our dogs and try their pet patio experience ;) thanks again Jim for your excellent service hopefully we get you again next year!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my dog so I called ahead of time to make sure hes allowed in d patio. I was asked to make a reservation because it gets crowded. But when we got there, there was only one table being occupied outside so there's plenty of seating available! It took a while before somebody attended to me. The staff were very nice to my dog though. It's cool that they also have food and dessert for dogs. My dog loved it! However the chicken parmigiano I had wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I love Annie's! They have the best appetizers.... The rice balls and shrimp scampi just to name a few! They have a fabulous happy hour! And the service is outstanding! A great wine selection too, and the entrees are so good and so filling and very good size proportions!"}
{"text":"Dinner Saturday night. Waiter Steve was great,friendly and wanted to please. Accommodated us with special requests. Food was very good and garlicky. We had Caesars salad and garden salad,both very crisp and flavorful. Entrees were chicken parm,sausage and pepper and chicken piccata, with sides of pasta and garlic aioli. Heard they are moving to larger venue in 6 months. Hope Steve goes with them"}
{"text":"Annie's offers pretty legit Italian fare, just like your Italian mother makes (which I wouldn't know anything about, my mom's Okinawan)... Mangia bene, anyway   Located right off of Valle Verde and the 215, on the other side of the Smith's shopping center, Annie's Gourmet Italian offers up your standard pasta dishes, and I had heard the Tiramisu is made in-house! (My wife and I's favorite dessert...). The interior is dark and cozy, booths line the window front and far wall surrounding the dining room tables. On the tops of each booth, adding more privacy are illuminated photos of Annie's family history...adds to the ambience (as you listen to Sinatra's greatest hits in the background). There is also a hidden bar in the back and outside patio seating (which I'm told allows pets).  We've had been to Annie's once before, I had a Groupon...I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp and the wife had the potato gnocchi, both were delicious. This time around we started with the antipasto platter. This thing was huge (probably meant for a party of four), fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto, salami, ham, roast beef, roasted peppers, green and black olives, artichoke hearts on top of a bed of greens and topped with a cross-hatch of thin breadsticks...it wuz amazing. This time around, I tried the Chicken Piccata. Lightly sautéed , pounded chicken breast in a buttery, lemony, white winey sauce with capers...soooo good. The wife had the Chicken Marsala, which she only had a couple bites...too much of the antipasto! Looked and smelled delicious, though. We were stuffed, but took the Tiramisu home for later.  So, what have we learned ...Annie's is legit Italian food, and my mom makes a mean taco-rice but always served her marinara out of a jar (sorry mom). Try Annie's Gourmet Italian...and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I would never go back!  The service was horrible... Sat with empty drinks for half the night, even after asking.  The food was very average and way overpriced.  I honestly would have rather eaten at Olive Garden, which I compare even their food to microwaved tasting entrees.  The sauce was not good and the shrimp was chewy.  I thought the seating was too close; felt crowded.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"I'm quite shocked at most of the reviews though if you read them all still reflect great food but a lack of service.   My experience was certainly much better. The food is excellent... Holy garlic heaven. Our service with Lourdes was incredible. She is attentive friendly charming and so nice.   The restaurant is moving a few blocks north which is still in my area and I look forward to more experiences. Great, great food!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try it based on reviews but I'm glad we didn't listen.  The service started a bit slow but the bartender came out and happily took some orders.  There were 3 of us and we were all happy with our meals!  It seems their problem might be a staffing issue."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food. We ate at the bar (it was early) and had great service. All Fresh ingredients (cooked to order) which takes a little longer but is worth the wait. The salads were fresh and amazing (also the garlic, olive, dipping sauce served with he bred is amazing)."}
{"text":"The $7 plate splitting fee is offensive, and the reason we won't come back. Our check was still $40, which is fine. But I guess the $7 is important to someone. I told the manager, and she just said, \"I'll tell the owner.\"   Too bad, we live right there and we're excited to have a high end dining option within walking distance.  I told everyone who would listen to avoid this restaurant as well. This is horrible customer service and we'll just drive to any of the other 20 Italian restaurants in Green Valley."}
{"text":"3 Stars for responding!! The owner of the restaurant responded to my posting from a week ago. Thank you for your reply, I am glad your business is healthy and I must have been in a different restaurant, but unfortunately I was at your place.  I am glad for your business to have so much success the F&B business is tough and a labor of love, obviously you care greatly about your business.  But!!  I would read all your Yelp Reviews because mine is not the only negative one.  Best of Luck!"}
{"text":"The artichoke appetizer was very good but our main course was very mediocre.  I wanted veggies instead of pasta and the waitress said no problem but when the bill came, we were charged $5:00 for some broccoli and squash.  I asked to see Annie and she said pasta only cost .25 and that is why the veggies were $5.00!!!.  We would never go back there."}
{"text":"Annie's Gourmet Italian. When a restaurant includes Gourmet and table cloths you can bet on high prices but can they deliver the goods as in good food. I thought Annie's was way over priced and the Italian food was meh. Except for the usual wait Olive Garden would probably be better and cheaper or try Nora's Cuisine on Flamingo. Not worth another stop at Annie's Gourmet Italian. This place has since closed for good. I'm not surprised!"}
{"text":"Visited Annie's last night, very disappointed with the service and quality of the food. Food was tasteless and did not look fresh.  Not worth the price at all!!  Very slow night and we waited a long time for our food.   Very very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Annie's.  I didn't dine with them before they moved locations so I wanted to give it a try.    We decided to just try some appetizers for our first visit.  We chose the blackberry walnut Brie to start.  It was ok.  The Brie was almost too thick and didn't melt well enough.  The maple glaze that was drizzled over the top was too much.  It really took away from the Brie.  It would have tasted better without it.   The trio sampler included calamari, fried mozzarella, and ricotta filled ravioli.  I really think everything on this plate came from a frozen box, heated and put on a plate.  I wouldn't recommend it.    I will say Aaron our waiter was great.  He was very attentive and courteous.  Drinks were kept filled while smiling the entire time. Even though he was great, I wouldn't recommend this place. Bummer."}
{"text":"I decided to give this restaurant five stars for two reasons. One is simply because they cater to dogs, and I'll give anybody five stars for that. They get a full three-course meal including dessert and the owner and employees seem to genuinely enjoy having them around. The second reason is to help offset the low average rating as I believe this restaurant isn't as bad as it's being represented. I have seen a lot of the low one star reviews and unfortunately I have to agree with much of the content of those reviews however.  As many have mentioned, the service has been terrible both times I went. Last time, I was greeted by a rather snobby male waiter who frowned upon me for not having reservations even though I could clearly see that they were not busy. I noticed Annie's comments to those criticisms and noticed she said she took care of it, but those were older reviews and I have been there very recently and had that experience. It took forever to get our orders and they had made significant mistakes but we just decided to let them get away with it since we waited for so long. One mistake worth mentioning is that my fiancé asked the server three times for a side of the marinara sauce so she could dip her bread in it, but by the time it came out, the bread was long gone (removed, not all eaten).  While waiting for such a long time in-between meals, nobody came over to refill our drinks or ask us if we would like more wine. We have been there twice and the breadsticks taste dry and bland as if they just warmed them after leaving them out for too long. The rest of the food we ate was nothing special, however I wouldn't say it was one star worthy either. I never hated anything I ate there (maybe 3.8 stars roughly food wise), and my fiancé loves their pasta sauce.   Anyway, I briefly met the owner the last time I was there and I love what she is trying to do with this restaurant for dog lovers. I just believe she needs to get her staff under control and set higher expectations for customer service. As for the food, I'm not a restaurant owner and I'm sure it's easier said than done, but I do think this restaurant could use a more \"gourmet\" experience to complement the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Painfully mediocre Italian cuisine in the suburbs, despite the friendly service and delightful owners. The good news is you can bring Fido and he will be served meatballs and doggy ice cream; he'll be sure to love you forever. Your two-legged dinner companions? Not so much....  P.S. I'm not sure why this place appears closed on Yelp as we had dinner there a few days ago."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends earlier this evening.  This restaurant is dog friendly, so we sat on the patio, since dogs are allowed to be taken there.  The price for the food is a bit steep, however, the service was very attentive and friendly.  The food was room temp when brought out to the table.  Tasty meal, but not what I was expecting, considering the prices they charge.  For me, it wasn't worth the drive."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst gourmet Italian restaurants I have ever gone to in Las Vegas! The service was inadequate from the start and got worse as the meal went on. I asked for more bread, but it never came, but the oil and vinegar arrived and I had to ask again for bread and I was at the end of my meal when it finally arrived!  I would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to my family or friends. They were overpriced and the quality of food I received was lacking. STAY AWAY! I would rate it ZERO STARS if Yelp would allow me."}
{"text":"A special shout out to Chef Annie and her staff.. This place is amazing From the moment we walk in to the moment we leave we are treated like family.  The food is made with a special passion and the hospitality is irreplaceable... I would HIGHLY recommend this cozy little place to everyone Annie, Lana, Fransisco and Andrew are such genuine souls and I wanna Thank you for all you do. ..  Sincerely,  Angela & Thomas Chisolm"}
{"text":"Very average Italian food for very high prices, 2 orders of spaghetti and meatballs with one soft drink and our bill was $50.00 including tip.  Kept scanning the menu for reasonably priced entrees but there were none to be found, even had to pay extra for a garden salad instead of the offered Caesar salad, wow!  The service was attentive once the waitress arrived but that took quite a while.  Upon entering the restaurant, no one greeted us and after a few minutes, another diner told us they were all in the kitchen but someone should appear shortly....."}
{"text":"My sorority was hosting an event and needed a caterer.  Annie and her team came through for us super last minute and did a phenomenal job!  They gave us a huge amount of food and it was all super delicious! It was unbelievable.  Thank you so much again and we hope to do business again with you in the future :)"}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much. But I was disappointed with the food. Also, they had music blaring to the point where we could not hear each other across the table. The menu is your typical Italian fare, just over priced (IMO).  I don't like to be critical but you can get better food at half the price elsewhere.  Oh well, another $75 dinner that was not worth it. It's not the first time and I am sure it won't be the last."}
{"text":"Good was disappointing, bread was flavorless, service was incredibly slow. Patio is lovely but doesn't make up for the slow service."}
{"text":"High priced mediocre food.  We recently moved nearby and decided to try this place, and came here late in a Saturday. To shorten what well be an otherwise long review here are some bullet points.  - Calamari came out quick, but was gummy/chewy. Bread and tapenade are good however.   - Originally ordered rigatoni and took them about twenty minutes to tell us they were out.   - Understandably it's cooked to order but food took a very long time to come out especially since it was not at all crowded.   - Food is a bit on the higher end, and wouldn't mind being paid for if it was very good which it is not.   - The atmosphere is nice and the service is ok, it's family owned and dog friendly which are this places only saving points, but personally would rather go to Olive Garden, which is kind of a sad thing to say."}
{"text":"Annie and her mom are the sweetest ladies! This cozy family restaurant reminds me of the Italian Family Restaurant I used to go to as a kid except now I can enjoy a nice glass of wine! Attentive, prompt,  good service, contemporary comfortable dining room,  and delicious food!   This new restaurant is B E A U T I F U L  and I love that I can bring my kids AND my fur babies out for a delicious lunch or dinner.   **There is an opening in the wall that opens to reveal  Annie's Lost Weekend Bar and it is a fully stocked beautiful bar and has flat screens all over the room. Perfect comfortable spot for watching the game and that before or after dinner drink ;)  I definitely can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times it's always hit or miss, I've had some great food and not so good. The service was super slow last night and there where a total of possibly 4 tables full and the food did not seem as fresh and not so good tasting at all. Very disappointed on this visit!"}
{"text":"We FINALLY made it in tonight after wanting to try it for the past few months & we were not disappointed! The entire staff was so friendly. The bartender came by our table to say hi & chat a few times & Annie (the owner!) even came by our table to meet us & say hello. I had the Veal Marsala, which was delicious & my boyfriend had the Shrimp Scampi that he loved! We will definitely be back to try their happy hour in the bar sometime soon...they have happy hour 7 days a week from 4-7p!"}
{"text":"Well first with the positives. it is a very clean place, very nice atmosphere, and good customer service. We were greeted right away and seated right away.  That's about it for the positives.  The food was extremely bland, small portions, and way WAY overpriced! my wife did not even like how her meal tasted, and it was obvious that she wasn't eating it, and the waitress didn't even say anything to us or offer to replace the meal or take it off the check.  And the kids meals are $10!!! Way too expensive for what they got.  Salads were, of course extra. everything was extra!  I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a 1980s Classic Italian place. From the food to the atmosphere t is 1980s all the way. Now they do it well but they need a menu overhaul and to fix that crime they call a cannoli."}
{"text":"Annie's has many of the makings of a high end restaurant such as the prices and ambiance, besides that, it is sorely lacking. My girlfriend and I were seated immediately with the restaurant fairly busy. We were both surprised at how nice the interior was; dimly lit with old photos of the owners in their 1950s prime. It was very nice and felt welcoming.  Then the problems started. It took at least 12-15 minutes for our waiter to come by (granted, someone came by to say he'd be by \"soon\" and that they were very busy), but when he did, he walked up, said hello and introduced himself, then he went to go check to see if we were his table, then came back and said he'd be back in a minute and went five feet away to a table that had been seated after us and took their drink orders. It was absolutely ridiculous. Almost laughable. We didn't order drinks solely for that reason.  When he finally did come by, we just wanted to order and eat since we were starving. Following that, it was another 15 minutes of waiting before we got bread (we had to ask). I ordered the chicken parmigiano and my girlfriend ordered the potato gnocci. The gnocci was great and being as famished as I was, I was so excited to eat my meal, only to be completely let down. The first bite of the chicken I spit out. I don't do that, but I had to. It was this chewy, rubbery texture that I thought was fat. It turned out the entire chicken was pretty much the same consistency. We deduced that it was a really cheap cut of chicken. At least it wasn't under cooked (which I thought it was at first). Regardless, it was almost inedible. Oh and $7 to split the check? Not that we needed to, but good god that's ridiculous.   I just moved to town and I really wanted to like Annie's, but I saw little charm or reason to ever visit again despite the decor, which, unfortunately, you cannot eat.  One star is harsh, but I think in our case, it is completely warranted. If anyone had eaten the chicken I did or waited the length we did for literally anything that a restaurant should do as soon as you sit down, you would think the same."}
{"text":"I would like to start this review by stating that I love and support locally owned businesses. Annie's is not a cookie cutter meal like Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill, it seems to be a local family owned restaurant. For this reason is why the food may take longer than those big chain restaurants, because it is probably made fresh to order.   My wife and I enjoyed our dinner at Annie's, the servers were very pleasant and attentive. We ordered the Meatball Scampi as an appetizer, and oh wow what flavor!!! The meatballs were so tender and fluffy, covered with chopped garlic and butter and served with two pieces of bread to soak up all that sauce. I would seriously have to have this with my last meal!!! For the main dish my wife ordered the pasta primavera and I had the baked rigatoni with sausage. Both dishes were great, I would recommend them to anyone with plans to visit Annie's.  Is Annie's the best Italian I have ever eaten? No it's not, but it ranks right up with some good ones. So it took almost an hour for us to have some bread, an appetizer, salad and our main dish. We never went with an empty glass for an extended period of time and we were made to feel right at home by our server. Food cooked fresh to order is a different animal and we understand and accept it. Remember, slow down, enjoy the experience and lets support small local businesses!!"}
{"text":"Ate at Annie's last night.  Three stars for food.  Five stars for service at the bar.  Gio....makes the best martinis in the world.  He makes the bar fun.  A great guy and server.  Our group met the nicest person \"Sunny\".  Great fun. Now the food:  The Cesar Salad was THE BEST!  The spaghetti and meatballs....OVER THE TOP WONDERFUL....Garlic bread, perfect.  So why the three stars?  The Scampi with angel hair...just PLAIN...tasteless, even with visible garlic clove.  The scampi....COLD, yes...Cold.  Sent it back.  IT WAS MICROWAVED....Scampi...like rubber.  Really  Would we return, yes...any restaurant has bad nights and mistakes.  And we love the bar.  I understand Annie's has a wonderful Happy Hour.  We will check it out."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews! I was REALLY pleased with my lunch here a few weeks ago. Huge portions and really tasty food. Delicious bread basket with all the fixings. AND it's like the only dog friendly patio in town! Not to mention their patio is adorable decorated with a great ambiance. They have a little grass area and water bowls for the pups. I honestly loved this place and will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this place for happy hour but they have since changed their prices making it not worth it. $50 for a few drinks and an appetizer of ok mozzarella sticks hurts. Do not go for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Came to Annie's by default due the Sushi place next door closing at 9:30pm on a Saturaday night. It was a very very pleasant surprise to find this place. We walked in at 9:30 on a Saturday night and they were happy to serve us. They seated us right away and served us right away. Everything was good from the bread to the desert. Our server (Jim) took excellent care of us. I had the Chicken Piccata and my husbad had the Lasagna w/ meat sauce. Tiramisu was so delicious. This is definitely my new go to place for Italian food."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been MORE disappointed...Took some friends there because they LOVE Italian food...My first and LAST experience. The food at Olive Garden is superior to this place!!! Slow service, bland and tasteless food, overpriced, etc."}
{"text":"If you don't feel like eating anytime soon this is a nice place to come relax on the patio. Sad when a party of 6 can't get proper service. Waited over two hours for dinner. Dinning room was half full and there was three tables taken outside. Ooopss make that two, one couple got up and left after they didn't get any service. Kept asking our waiter to have the manager talk to us and he kept saying that they were busy. Come to find out there is no manager, only the owner who apparently didn't care enough about her customers to come out and apologize for us having to wait so long. On top of having to wait we had to track someone down to refill our water. Food might be good, we don't know because we never got to eat and we won't be back to a place where the owner can't come out and say \"I'm sorry\"....which is all we really wanted...and waiters who have to be tracked down to do their job. Hope the remaining staff are looking for other jobs, because this is a sinking ship. If she treats her customers like she treated us, then I am sure she treats her staff even worse."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. Everyone on staff was pleasant and helpful. Not the most kid-friendly (no cups with lids). The stuffed mushrooms were tasty, but only slightly warm to cool. The eggplant  and veal parm were tasty, but I think overpriced for what you get. It feels like a restaurant that can't decide whether to be casual or fine. Linen napkins (with paper napkin centerpieces) and oil lamps, but tissue paper plate liners. Might go again without the kids. The patio looked nice for alfresco dining."}
{"text":"Now I know...why we've never eaten here before and why we will never come back.  Here it goes:  My husband and I came her for dinner a couple weeks ago because his mom gave us a $50 gift certificate for Hanukkah.  His parents live in Henderson not too far from this restaurant.  The restaurant is located on the corner of Horizon Ridge/Valle Verde.  It is hidden in a small plaza next to Shabu Shabu paradise.  There were 2 families when we arrived so plenty of seating on a Friday night.  The waitress sat us in what she called the prime table because....get this...it is next to a window that faces the street!  LOL Really, prime seating because I'm watching cars drive by!!!  Ok, so we ordered a couple glasses of their house Chardonnay ($6 or $7 a glass) and the following:  - Caprese Salad - Slices of fresh whole milk mozzarella and vine ripened tomatoes, layered atop imported balsamic glaze, and garnished with fresh basil sprigs. $9.95  (Nothing special...but I've had better. Portion good for two if you're not that hungry.  The cheese was dry and not silky smooth)  - Eggplant Parmigiana- Freshly sliced eggplant coated and fried in Italian herbs and bread crumbs, topped with mozzarella, parmesan cheese and our homemade tomato sauce, then baked to perfection. Nobody makes it like Grandma Cungie !!! $15.95  (Big thick slices of eggplant served with penne pasta and red marinara.  The penne was over cooked and the marinara tasted like it came straight from a jar.  The eggplant was bearable)  - Chicken Piccata- Chicken breasts pounded and floured, then sautéed in lemon butter, white wine, and capers. $14.95  (The sauce on this plate was broken and so the waiter offered to send it back to the kitchen and make something else.  So he recommended the:  - Chicken Marsala - Chicken breasts pounded and floured, then sautéed in butter, olive oil, marsala wine, and sliced mushrooms. $14.95  (VERY salty...but we didn't want the waiter to feel bad as he already seemed very tired...wanting to call it a night)  I don't mean to be harsh but I don't really know how this establishment can stay open.  The staff were somewhat friendly but may need some customer service training because we did notice that when we left, the lady at the front didn't acknowledge us.  The food...well nothing special."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to Henderson, and we love Italian dining. So we purchased a Groupon, and headed to Annie's. The service was excellent. The food had very good flavor and was prepared well. There was a good variety of entrees. It was fairly reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Annie's first impressions are good, we sat outside on the patio as we would like to bring our dogs here after a good walk, plenty of shade and lots of space (read tables are not stacked on top of each other) The Caesar salad was very good, not too much and not drowned in Caesar sauce, they even came out on a chilled plate which to me makes a huge difference.   Jason our waiter was great, very attentive even though he was the only one working the lunch schedule and you could see he was running to keep up. Our main meal came out and I had the shrimp scampi over angel hair pasta, I must say the shrimps are huge and you get four of them in a serving, they were perfectly cooked too.  However the pasta was a little bland for me, after adding some salt it tasted better, but shouldn't the salt be added during cooking, I have never had to add salt to pasta, even at Olive Garden and I don't go there that much. My wife had veal piccata over pasta and she said the same thing about the pasta needing some salt, her Veal was ok but she said she had had better. I'm giving it three stars until my next visit and try and give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Bread was day old, salad dressing was good but salad was over dressed. Shrimp was nice size but tasted pre cooked, angel hair pasta was not drained well, no flavor and the lasagna was inedible. My dog food was pre cocked this place is expense and so gross will be out of business in no time"}
{"text":"This place has potential that was unfortunately wasted by Annie. Annie is a rude elitist that treated me like a leper during my meal. The food is watery and gross. I paid $40 bucks for gnocchi soaked in a tub of butter and fettuccine Alfredo that smelt like dog piss. I had two Groupons to this place but will cut my losses and not try to attempt to use the second one. Annie can take that money I spent on nothing to make a career change. Taste buds beware."}
{"text":"We came to Annie's to use a groupon I had bought the week before. I had always wanted to stop by this Italian spot as I always saw it when I visited friends at dragonridge. Got there right at the stroke of 4pm on a Saturday.  We were seated immediately and the only ones in the restaurant as they had just opened. It happened to be \"happy hour\", though I wouldn't call it that. Their happy hour consisted of $1 off beer and $3 off bottles of wine. Bread came out first, some ok baked rolls. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms as our appetizer. They should really call them overstuffed mushrooms!  They were tasty and felt like they were cooked in mama's kitchen. The next course, Caesar salad was good.  The main course came next. I had chicken Parmesan and a side of meatballs. The wife had the Mediterranean chicken pasta.  All three dishes had a great taste and stayed in the theme of home cooking. Overall it was a relaxing and average meal."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon so we could try this place out. The food was amazing - every dish was excellent. Not a very good location but a wonderful meal in peaceful environment. They even will accommodate your dog on the patio and have a special menu for your furbaby- haven't tried it yet but will be going back. Recommend- authentic Italian."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a retirement party there since we enjoyed them at their last location.  I made the reservation on-line then went in to double check the menu.  The waitress seemed over whelmed with my questions telling me she had to wait on tables. (The was only one other customer in there to deal with). She got the manager (Becky)who proceeded to roll her eyes as she was walking our way.  Becky couldn't answer the few questions we did have and said the owner would have to call us.  Really, Becky? You're the a manger and you can't tell me if you guys do family style or not.  Awesome. She took down our name and number in an attempt to make us think she gave a crap. The owner never called.  The next day I cancelled my reservation. Funny, a half hour after I cancelled the owner called."}
{"text":"Boyfriend ordered spaghetti & meatballs and I ordered chicken parm. With all pasta entrees, it includes a salad of your choice. Mine didn't come with that though... =/ boo. Wonder why. It'll be fair if all dinner entrees came with a salad.  Food was good. Simple...but good. It wasn't \"out of this world\" but sometimes....less is more. Sometimes, the most simple dish can be so satisfying. Got some yummy leftovers to take home too. The waiter was attentive and restaurant had such a nice ambiance. Ambiance was like your old school NY Italian style restaurant. Lots of old family photos and Sinatra music was the soundtrack.   Really enjoyed my dinner here. Also, I'm really happy to see that this is such a pet friendly restaurant. Enough for them to even have their own pet menu!!!! =) If you bring them with you, patio seating only but I took a peak at the patio and it's really pretty and serene. Perfect for cool, Spring/Fall evening.  I love pet friend places so this was a big plus for me."}
{"text":"Wow yelp, some harsh reviews.  We ate here awhile ago and thought it was decent.  The one star reviews are comical because if this place is one star, I can send them to some places that will really curl their socks.    Pretty entertaining with the owner defending their food too.  You are not going to win these internet review battles by calling out everyone that doesn't like your food.   This leads me directly why we never came back.  My wife and I were greeted in a very peculiar manner upon our arrival.  When we entered there was only ONE other table seated.   The hostess asked if we had reservations and we received the raised eyebrows when we answered that we had not.  We were scolded for not making reservations and they would seat us this time.  NOT a great first impression.   Even funnier was that by the time we payed the bill and left a nice tip despite being admonished for not making reservations....there were only THREE tables seated.  Maybe the owners can take the criticism from this site constructively to build a better restaurant.  Overall, the experience was good.  The the food was fine and the ambience is quiet and intimate.  It does seem like this place is trying to be something more than it is  ***DISCLAIMER***  I am not a disgrunlted ex-employee and I appreciate it when people are trying to do good for the community."}
{"text":"Horrible service. 45 minutes to put in a food order and get bread.  Food, olive garden would be better.  Bland and uninventive."}
{"text":"Call to make a reservation first. Always busy but delicious. Prices are reasonable and food is excellent! It's very romantic. Outdoor seating is very nice too. I have been their at least 5 times & it's been great every time!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews here on yelp and decided to rate our experience dining at Annies for ourselves....Honestly,we can't figure how anyone could give this place anything less than 5 stars!We were greeted very congenial by the hostess upon our arrival and especially liked the restaurants atmosphere,we decided to have a cocktail in the bar, Giovanni was our bartender and made my husband a fantastic Margarita,he was extremely willing to please when my husband told him how he liked it prepared.While sitting at the bar,you can see the kitchen through a pass thru window as the food is being prepared,we could see the staff and admired their professionalism as they prepared the meals.We ordered the stuffed mushrooms with sausage for our appetizer,it was served with wonderful fresh made rolls and an oil based olive spread that was delicious!!Our choice for our dinner was spaghetti and meatballs(Nice size portion)and my husband had the Rigatoni Roberta(Its made with egg plant)we brought left overs home,it was very good!!We even met the owner Annie!! We found her to be extremely friendly, she most definately takes pride in her cooking and wants to make sure her customers are happy and will return to her lovely establishment...We definately will dine at Annies again!!"}
{"text":"Annie's gourmet Italian was a surprise.  I didn't expect much from the restaurant being in a small residential strip mall, but boy was I pleasantly surprised.  I love the fact that they have a hidden bar, which also serves a full menu.  My husband and I got an appetizer the rice balls with marinara.  Very delicious, great portion size for an appetizer.  Next was the chaser salad, holy moly, I would suggest ordering dressing on the side because there was about 3x too much dressing on it.  The entree though was marvelous.  I had veal piccata and boy oh boy was it to die for.  My mouth is just watering at the thought.  The veal was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy.  There was a perfect portion of pasta, I hate when there is like wayyyyy too much.  The sauce was incredibly delicious, with just the right amount of capers.  Our server was a very eager to please older gentleman, I don't remember his name but he was very attentive without hovering.  Service was great, food was yummy aside from the salad, I look forward to going back!!!"}
{"text":"I never went to their original location but understand this is a terrific upgrade.  Great atmosphere inside and outside dining.  Service is great and food is very good....the price is right.  Only one problem....I like to bring my own wine and I pay corkage, no matter what it is up to $30...but Annie does not allow it.  Her wine list is very good but I like what I like and I make sure I have it when I bring it myself and don't have the stress of turning a bottle away.  Our waiter was prompt and courteous beyond just doing his job....we did tip him well but her didn't know that we would.  Garden dining looks wonderful too and will try that next time...maybe I can hide my wine and a glass in a big purse....no that would be stressful too.  May 12th...a month or so later:  It appears the owner/manager responds the same to all comments, good or bad....there is a terrible review on yelp and her response was not appropriate to the big complaint plus horrible picture of his dinner.  ALSO....the patio welcomes DOGS???? I DO NOT frequent restaurants with dogs or children...that is what Denny's is for...FF drivethru's until children a trained...and over 10 years old and dogs...only legitimate SERVICE dogs please...not fuu fuu emotional support yippers and lickers."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. Service was rarely offered. We got here at 6:30 and they were out of stuffed mushrooms. They ran out of take out boxes for the unflavored, bland chicken picatta. The rigatoni, while the portions were lots, it wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not really sure what's so gourmet about this place, other than the prices. The chicken parm was the tastiest thing I tried, but just okay. The bread and olive tapenade were okay. The other things I tried lacked A LOT of seasoning. The service was decent. However, I don't think I'd return based on the lack of flavor and prices. I'm sure there's a lot better quality out there for the price. Oh yeah, if you don't want big chunks of garlic in your food you might want to say something. I was unpleasantly surprised when I took a big bite of a chunk of garlic in my food......"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Our server was so sweet. We came in for a later dinner and was seated right away. Every person that worked there checked on us, glasses always full! We had to leave right after our appetizer arrived, due to sleepy children, but getting our entree's packaged to go was not an issue. Hands down, one of the best local businesses we've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! A great local spot! Love the dog-friendly patio & meal! They really made us feel welcome. We'l be back!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is the worst dinning experience my wife and I have ever had. Very far from gourmet.  We were told a year ago by friends in the area that it was a nice place. Plus it had won several best-of awards. So when we were driving by one night we decided to drop in and treat ourselves to a nice meal. What a mistake, we should have Yelped it first. The food was not edible and tasteless. I had the Baked Rigatoni based on the servers recommendation, my wife had the Shrimp Scampi, one of her go-to favorites. After a few bites I just stopped eating, the sauce was horrible, a sort of chunky mushy dried-up mess with absolutely no flavor. This dish consisted of some poorly cooked pasta with very little sauce topped with some mozzarella and baked. A can of Chef Boyardee would have been better.  My wife said the Scampi was tasteless, and it was. They probably waved a jar of garlic powder over the so-called sauce. However, the shrimp were large and a good portion, but at that point I did not want to try one. I guess she ate about  of the meal before she gave up.   The salad is very strange as well as the bread. I had to doctor up the salad with grated cheese to give it some flavor. One taste and my wife refused to eat the salad. The balsamic and olive oil are nicely presented on the table, but the oil was clearly old and just about to go rancid.  On the bright side, the room is comfortable, with a pleasant decor. But the open fast-food style service counter with soda disperser at the entrance is off-putting. Our waiter was very friendly and proficient but the service did not come close to making up for the horrible food. Dinner for two was $50 with drinks.   Avoid going here if you enjoy good Italian fare. I have no idea how they won the best-of awards unless Annie has lots of relatives voting.  P.S. We were also asked immediately if we had reservations with the room half empty."}
{"text":"This is a cute little neighborhood Italian restaurant.  I've only eaten here once and gotten take out once.  Both times I've LOVED their Rice Balls.... balls of rice with ooey-gooey cheese and seasonings rolled in bread crumbs and baked to a lovey light crunch.  My Chicken Marsala on our last visit was wonderful.  Really good flavor and lots of chicken and mushrooms.  I had enough for lunch the next day.  :)    The pasta and marinara side were a little disappointing.... the marinara needed \"something\"... it tasted too ordinary.  But that won't stop me from going back again because I really like their Rice Balls."}
{"text":"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the very flavorful veal marsala although  there were only three slices of mushrooms. I guess I'm used to having a lot more mushrooms on veal marsala.  One other diner ordered the pasta Primavera and I guess she didn't read all the way to the end of the description because it came with an Alfredo sauce that she didn't want  She spent three weeks in Italy and raved about the pasta Primavera she had everywhere, except that it's made with fresh tomatoes not Alfredo sauce. I've been making that dish for about 30 years and I've never heard of it with Alfredo sauce but I have to admit  she gave me a taste of it and it was delicious.  So if you like Alfredo sauce I would advise getting this dish. Prices for most of their dishes are all À la cart and they are  a bit on the high side. Veal Marsala   with an added small, very plain salad was  $26.50.   We were seated immediately when we arrived.   There was only one other couple in the restaurant for the whole two hours we were there from 6  till 8 PM so service was excellent. Very nice decor, very comfortable ambience. All  in all  very good experience, but if prices were a bit lower we would return more often. The food is good, and it's right up the street from our neighborhood"}
{"text":"So the Italian cocktail was the best thing about our meal. $9.95 for a kids meal is probably $4 too high for just pasta and chocolate milk. I had the veal parm and the wife had the chicken parm and it was just OK. Nothing to rave about. I'm mean for $110 out the door, we could have better at Olive Garden.   Unlike some of the other reviews I've seen, however, the service was very good. Fast and very attentive servers. That's a plus."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and had amazing service and the most amazing food!! There was only one waiter working the whole restaurant but he did a great job checking on us and the other tables. Will definitely go back. We also used a groupon and our waiter knew exactly how to use it. Definitely felt the family owned atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I could write a 2 page review but in the essence of not wasting any yelpers time as Annie's Gourmet Italian had wasted mine here are some bullet points anyone considering this place should take into consideration.  1.) If you like paying $20+ for a plate of Italian food, seriously go to Olive garden instead, pay less and trust me the food at Olive Garden is better which is such a depressing statement to post.  2.) Expect slow and unattentive service.  3.) And with just my experience, but it could be different, if you actually eat the food and don't find it satisfactory don't expect a solution when brought to there attention just pay your large bill and walk away with your head held low as you just got swindled by this restaurant."}
{"text":"The word \"gourmet\" is an adjective describing food that is of high quality and exceptional taste.  Unfortunately, this concept was foreign to the proprietors of Annie's Gourmet Italian.  The nightmarish experience began with the bread, which had a hard crust but an odd, mealy texture which worsened when exposed to olive oil and balsamic.  The salad was limp and soggy and the Caesar dressing lacked flavor.  Then came the main dish, veal piccata.  The sauce was great, but words such as \"rubbery\" and \"tough\" should never be necessary to describe a veal dish.  The marinara served over the side dish of rigatoni was the highlight of this bleak meal.  However, an establishment billing itself as \"gourmet\" should not be serving \"out of the box\" pasta.  The service was decent.  We were seated promptly and the waitress was polite.  However, she did neglect to put in our order for calamari.  Judging by the rest of the meal, it is possible that was a blessing in disguise.  I think a renaming may be in order.  Annie's Mediocre Italian?  Then at least no one could sue them for false advertising.  Also, you have to wonder about the owners of this place.  People are entitled to their honest opinion of a business.  It seems someone connected with this restaurant questions any Yelp! post that does not view them favorably.  The accusations fly that you are less than intelligent or a bitter former employee.  Yes, being insulted really makes me want to come back and give the place another try!"}
{"text":"What an incredible Chicken Piccata! Extremely well cooked chicken and tasteful sauce! Yum! I had the Chianti Which was amazing and Dust had the Merlot which he said was very good. We ordered The artichoke hearts appetizer which also was an absolute delight! The bar had Monday night football games on which was a plus! Definitely will be coming back! Wanted to try something different than the usual and decided to come to Annie's! Wow! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little place to eat! The ambiance is casual/romantic. Service is on point, the staff are friendly and attentive. The presentation of their food is clean and beautiful, and is very delicious for the price. I would definitely recommend this place. I'll be coming back and bringing my dog so she can enjoy the pet option on the menu! Also as of right now there is a Groupon for this restaurant; don't miss this chance!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  On Mothers Day, it took 20 minutes just to take our order and a little under 90 minutes to get our food. They blamed it on it being busy earlier but by the time we ordered, the place cleared out. My food was ok, my wife hated it. There are a whole lot better places to go to for Italian food. This place likely won't last."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but expect a long wait to get your food. I was watching the clock because I was extra hungry and it took 25 minutes to get a small basket of bread and then 5 minutes later got the antipasti meat platter- nothing really required major preparation. And took another 40 minutes to get the main dishes, which were easy to make (good thing none of us ordered the risotto which does says it takes 25-30 minutes to make).  Go there if you would like a power lunch or dinner because the food tastes home made, but if you have a early curfew or have a show/appointment to attend, go to the Olive Garden instead. The restaurant was more than half empty, maybe the kitchen staff was also..."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a nice place within walking distance.  This was very disappointing. The restaurant was clean and inviting.  The service was good.  The food was lacking.  It started with the rolls.  They definitely were not freshly baked.  In fact they had the texture of the rolls that you buy in the freezer section of the grocery, thaw out and then bake.  Not good.  The olive tapenade with the rolls was a nice touch. The main courses were marginal.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were dense and had no texture and marginal flavor.  My better half had the eggplant parmesan.  Not good.  The eggplant was mushy and the breading soggy.  She left most of it on the plate. With all of the good Italian places in the area, we will not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian New Yorker, I'm being really nice by giving this place two stars.   Pros: Pictures of family in restaurant made it feel like a warm East Coast vibe, our server was nice and the salad was good.   Cons: bread (it wasn't even good Italian bread; it was like a hard wheat roll), sauce/food. We ordered the mushrooms for an appetizer, eggplant parmigiana and rigatoni Roberta for dinner. The mushrooms were a little dry. In the eggplant parmigiana and rigatoni Roberta there was this spice we couldn't identify. It's like it didn't belong there at all! An example would be like putting curry in sauce (an Indian spice in Italian food)! It was so foreign and threw the taste completely off. My mom didn't even eat her meal. We felt bad, so asked for a box/take it to go and as soon as we left threw it in a garbage outside. True story.   Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Annie's gourmet is far from gourmet.  Very long wait for food. Service was not attentive.  Food was average at best, Olive Garden is better. The only redeeming qualities were chicken parm and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The reviews written here are a bit too harsh. Yes, the food did take a while  and was a tad over priced. But the waitress staff was very polite and willing to answer our questions. I liked the bread and oil deal and the staff was very good about refilling water. It took very long to get our food but I was satisfied. I ordered the veal parmigiana with a side of angel hair in marinara. The sauce tasted pretty home made to me but I'm no expert. The meat was tender and not over done. I would have preferred more mozzarella and less ricotta but maybe that's just me. My girlfriend ordered the tortellini in Alfredo and thought it was pretty decent. The atmosphere was quaint and had the family owned feel that I like. I plan on returning so we can use our other living social coupon but I can't say this is the best Italian place in Henderson after having been to ventano's and Buon Gusto."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant because we read how it was family owned using recipes from family in Italy. The Olive spread was very tasty. I ordered the veal parmigiana. It came with Pasta. It was unique in that it had a layer of rigotti cheese. Very different .  We would return and try another entree.  The atmosphere is very nice with family photos from way back .   Patio dining is available and dogs are welcomed.  Very good service. Rates a return!"}
{"text":"A mom and pop operation. Empty on a Saturday night. My wife loved her shrimp scampi. The Cesar salads were great. Way too much lasagna so I can have it for lunch tomorrow. The decor was nice. The chicken was dry my son-in-law said. Probably won't return Service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!!  Love the quaint cozy atmosphere..family run..old family recipes..try the rice balls and stuffed mushrooms..we loved it all...see you soon!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Don't waste your time or money.  in detail: arrived with my hubby and three kids around 7pm. There was only one other couple dining there at the time. I walked in while hubby gathered the kids.   No one waited on me at first, then a hostess came up and asked in a very snooty tone if I had RESERVATIONS. I pointedly looked around and said 'Do I NEED them?\"  She then proceeded to argue with me as to why I should choose a table that had high stools. I told her my kids are too small for that, they need a table for five. She insisted on a stooled table.  At this point I walked out to find my husband about to enter the restaurant with our three kids. I shook my head and said \"I dont think this is a good place for kids.\" because I thought the reason she was treating me thusly was because I had kids.  A woman going into the restaurant overheard me, asked me what had happened, and ushered us in, insisting that they serve children, she went to the hostess and fussed at her, saying \"people do NOT need a reservation to eat here.\" I didnt really want to eat there after that, but my kids were hungry and the woman (I guess the owner?) insisted.  unfortunately, the owner/manager left after that, and the hostess then proceeded to seat us at a four-topper table (we needed a five) and pulled a chair up so my sons (ages two and three) could sit next to each other. WTF? I TOLD her we needed a five topper. If you dont have one give us a six topper, or an eight, but this was just unbelievable. The restaurant, as you may recall, was mostly empty.   The restaurant started to fill up with other patrons and there were other people with kids, and also a kids menu, so at this point I didn't understand her attitude.  If got worse as the night wore on. We waited and waited for her to take our order. She finally took it, and then we waited and waited and waited some more for it to come out. When it finally did, she didn't deliver it, someone else did, and they didnt wait around to see if it was correct. I was busy getting the food ready for my kids (the side dishes were all wrong), so it was a few minutes before i tried my own food.  It was the totally wrong order.  So was my husbands.  But no wait staff were in sight.  We were starving by this point, so we proceeded to eat it anyway. But my husband has a bad stomach and can eat only certain things, and he couldnt eat his meal.  the waitress didnt check on us for THIRTY MINUTES. We had to wait for everything.  At that point my meal was finished, though it was the wrong thing (the food was totally immemorable), my kids were done, and my husband hadnt eaten his food. She offered to bring him his original meal. He said ok.  She went into the back and brought out the original ICE COLD plate he had ordered!!!   I could not BELIEVE this!!!   My kids had sat there for about two hours at this point and they had had it, so I took them to the car. My husband followed after paying the check. He was FUMING. This woman had had the GALL to charge us for three entrees!' The bill for this fiasco was EIGHTY-EIGHT DOLLARS!!!  I have NEVER had service like this, anywhere. the waitress was argumentative, but did it with a smile on her face as though that made it OK. She was snooty the entire time we were there and acted like we were unwanted. Her whole attitude SUCKED  I hope to God the owner reads this. If I had an employee like this, I would fire them immediately. I was so upset by this, I couldn't fathom why on earth we were treated this way except perhaps that my ten year old daughter has downs syndrome, so I was actually relieved to read that other people had similar bad experiences here just so I knew it wasnt just us.  If I could, I would give this place a negative five stars."}
{"text":"The food and service in the nice little place was outstanding. Great portions and the sausage and peppers were to die for.  Make sure at least on person gets them.  Wine list was a little limited."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... (Sad) I like restaurants that are dog friendly because I'm a dog lover. The girl who waited on us was very nice and sweet (Oh, I feel bad now). Patio seating area was spacious and comfortable. Everything was amazing except for the food I had.  Salad... Fresh and crisp looking outside. Inside of it was just soggy pieces. I thought they put seaweed inside (Serious).  Chicken Piccata... I tasted nothing but white wine and lemon. I had to put a ton of salt to eat it. Never tasted chicken piccata this gross in my life.  Dog meat ball... Way too salty to give to any dogs unless you want your dogs to have their blood pressure skyrocket. Yes, I tasted it like I always taste anything I give to my dogs.   Dog dessert.... The ice cream was definitely for human. Well, it was much sweeter than my Haagen dazs vanilla ice cream. Of course my dog loved it. Hope she doesn't get diabetes.  They were out of Veal and turkey meat balls. Maybe everything tasted great if I had a bottle of red wine or two like the other couple that was sitting across from us. Too bad I didn't drink this time. Next time, I'll come back with a designated driver :-)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with Annies. I will return just for the Aranchini balls. They were very good and should of just ordered more as my main dish -Had the Chicken Picatta. the chicken was dry even though it was served in a wine sauce. It came with pasta with marinara sauce. It was served on the same plate and did not mix well with the chicken picatta. Either way the sauce was not very good."}
{"text":"Had a family dinner at Annie's recently and enjoyed everything! The server was very informative & able to make suggestions for anyone unsure if what to order. The rice balls are amazing! All out our meals were delicious! We shared a few deserts that were so good! The decor in the restaurant is so warming with family pictures! We will be back for another delicious Italian meal very soon!"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations of this restaurants based on Yelp reviews and recommendations from a few friends.  The restaurant is located in the corner of a little strip mall close to my home.  The ambiance and decor of the restaurant was nice.  They even had patio seating although the night I went it was still a bit too cool to sit outside.  A nice extra is that they even have dog meals on the menu (chicken meatballs) if you want to eat on the patio with your furry friend.  Whenever, possible I try and want to support family run and operated businesses like this one.    We started with a calamari appetizer, which was ok.  Breading on the outside of the calamari was little on the oily side.  I prefer my calamari crisp on the outside, tender inside.  We both started with cesaer salads, which were good, not great.  I was hoping for a table side salad, with our server asking how we liked our dressing.  Maybe even asking if we wanted anchovies on the side.  Not here.  Salad was fresh, just not special.  Same goes for the entrees.  I had the capellini and shrimp, my friend had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Mild seasoning on both made me grab for the salt and pepper shaker.  Perhaps thats they way the cook that night was feeling.    Our server was good, not overly attentive, but never had to ask to refill our water glasses.  Overall, I give this restaurant 3 stars.  Good but not great or anything special.  We had 2 glasses of wine and a coke, which brought our bill to almost $80 before tip.  For almost $100 I just expect more.  They did have a senior special for people 55 and up where there was a pasta and salad for special each night for less than $15.  Maybe I'll try them for lunch."}
{"text":"Just there last night (Friday 2/5) not good service! The guy waiting on us looked the part. Younger man, wearing a vest and hat. His service was not good. He was slow, he was not refilling drinks, we was not clearing plates. He delivered food and gave wrong dinners to my husband and his friend. The meals initially looked the same but one had chicken and the other had eggplant. The server started to switch the even after they had each taken a bite??? My husband waited a long time for his correct dinner. Food was good, bad service."}
{"text":"If your ever in the Vegas area Annie's is a great Italian place to eat! Delicious Italian dishes that make your mouth water! Love the calamari, and check out the secret bar!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did. The wait times were awful and the waiter had no idea what he was doing, despite telling us he had 5+ years experience in the industry. The food was no better than something you'd get at the mall food court but for extremely exuberant prices. I think I've enjoyed meals at Arby's more. Got a chance to say hi to the owner, Annie, and she was nothing short of rude and condescending. I won't be going back. Save your money and go to Olive Garden, and order a doggie bag for your pup there."}
{"text":"Very intimate Italian restaurant.   One of the most beautiful restaurants you ever walk into. The meal was coursed perfectly and the staff was great. We will be back.   :)"}
{"text":"By far the best Italian Restaurant in town. I have never had a bad dish here. And I have to mention that their Tiramisu is to die for!! I recommend it to all of my friends and family. If you're looking for great food with amazing service you've got to visit them."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Piccata and Caesar Salad and my boyfriend order Chicken Parm. Both meals were delicious although the chicken on mine was a little thick. I prefer thinner cutlets.   Staff was friendly and personable and atmosphere was cozy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"love the new location, the hidden bar and dog friendly spots. Food is the same good stuff with huge portions. only bad part was entrée slightly over cooked. meat and pasta burned on edges."}
{"text":"Ok, so we finally got to Annies. First of all glad they are moving because location location location sucks. they are moving to Smiths center at green valley and 215 in 3 weeks. I like the ambiance here. its dark,the Italian and soft rock was great. both servers were great and very enthusiastic. they are keeping their dog friendly patio but its gonna be private now.   The Food,  bread was good but not great. had the mushrooms and scampi meatballs and scampi for apps. meatballs and mushroom came together thus a little less sauce but fortunately lots of sauce in shrimps. Did want to doc meatballs with a little salt and parm but over all 4 stars.  Caesar salad got 5 stars. great.  wife had eggplant rigatoni....literally must be 5 lbs. biggest single serv of pasta I have eve seen. my lasagna was about 3 lbs. both were home made to order but were just missing a little something to put over top but cant put my finger on it. so both 4of5 stars.  cannoli's were a little too crisp and exploded when you bit into. could use a bit more filling also.  seems like everything is around $15 for apps and mains plus or minus 3 bucks.  We will definitely return to new locale but not stop visiting carrabas and ventanos. As far a the 3 venues Annies comes in 3rd only because ventano has the views.   wine list is small but good but a little pricey, bottle prices are the bargain. bought J lohr at lee's for $12 on tues. Annies wants $44.   all things considered it was romantic, wife and I did talk, not argue. Food was great and we will return and we sincerely hope the new location helps them to next level without losing what they have now.  Good luck Annie and we shall see you soon."}
{"text":"Very attentive service and the food was excellent. If you would like a quiet dinner in a good setting this is a wonderful choice.  Ask for Rodney he is an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the complaining is about...food was good and reasonably priced and it's nice to sit out on the patio when the weather is nice...I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Three of us had a very nice dinner here last Saturday. I knew from previous Yelp reviews that people were having mixed experiences. Here are my thoughts.  I loved the restaurant itself! the decor/ambience was really nice. The staff were all friendly and helpful.   The bread was very nice and the olive tapenade was divine. I would return just to eat more of that delicious olive spread! We ordered the duet appetizer which was stuffed mushrooms and meatballs. Both were great!  Our main courses were the rigatoni, veal picatta, and chicken picatta. The rigatoni and the chicken were great. The veal was only ok.  I personally was not impressed with the picatta sauce. We each upgraded to a different salad, but all agreed we wouldn't do so next time.  Dessert was spumoni ice cream cake and it was great!  As others have mentioned, the price was high. I want to visit again for another chance. The hard part is that there is so much good competition in the area and if your prices are going to be on the high side, your food quality has to hit it out of the park."}
{"text":"We tried this Annie's at its previous location and did not have a good experience.   My food was served cold while my friend's meal was warm.   And, it wasn't that great.   Since it moved to its new location we thought we would give it another try.   The atmosphere was really nice, especially the bar where we went to experience its Happy Hour.    We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and meatball scampi duet.  The stuffed mushrooms seemed like they may have been frozen and just microwaved plus they didn't have much flavor.   The meatballs had way too much garlic.   My friend who is Italian could not eat either one after her first taste.   I asked for some marinara sauce to make it more palatable.   While there were two meatballs and two stuffed mushrooms, I could not finish them because they were not very good.   The bread served with them was the best part of the experience.    We were so disappointed because we live within walking distance and thought this would be such a great addition to our neighborhood and fun place to share with friends.    The people sitting next to us had the same experience and same complaints.    I just don't understand it.   They are really missing out on lots of potential new customers.     I hope the owner reads the reviews and can improve the food because this would be such a lovely place to come for a meal."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting. Delicious comfort food at its best and you can even bring your dogs. There is an outside area where you can sit and eat with your pet beside you and they even make sure to provide your dog with a bowl of water. They can even serve your pet meatballs and a bowl doggy ice cream."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Took over 3 hours to get the food. The food was great until we ordered for our four legged friend and was brought food from the human menu for him. Coupled with the excessive cost and poor service from the waiter (almost let us leave without giving us the dessert for the dog). Not worth the money in gas I used."}
{"text":"Really wanted them to do better in the new location. The built out of the restaurant is done quite well so we were looking forward to a nice dinner. The best thing to hit the table that night was unfortunately the bread. We ordered Spaghetti & Meatballs (bland).....Chicken Parm (driest Chicken ever and why do they put Ricotta on the Parm).....the other two dishes were so flavorless that I already forgot what they were....honestly the other hospitals provide better food. You can tell they spent a lot of money to create a nice atmosphere if they had a cook to match this place could be very succesful despite the prices."}
{"text":"I've dined here three times and here is the breakdown on my feelings about those visits: 1st Visit: The food is okay, service is okay, and it's close to home so we'll have to come here again. 2nd Visit: I wonder why this place has so many bad reviews. We enjoyed our meal and will definitely come here again. 3rd Visit: We enjoyed our meals, but the service is painfully slow.  Let me start by saying that we'll definitely come here again. We want to love this place because it's close to home and the food we've had is decent. Ultimately, we'll have to stop coming here if the service doesn't improve. I actually wanted to leave before ordering on our third visit because our waiter disappeared after greeting us. He didn't even ask if we wanted to order when he dropped off our water. He just disappeared. To me it's a bad sign when the waiter is M.I.A. before I've even ordered. My husband made me stay which was good because I enjoyed my meal.   The meal begins with warm rolls, homemade tapenade, and oil with balsamic. The bread is good, but nothing to write home about. I love dipping bread in olive oil, but it definitely isn't the fine Italian oils that I'm accustomed to at home. The tapenade is the winner though. It contains both green and black olives (most people don't mix the two which is a mistake) and plenty of garlic. I love tapenade so this is a huge for me.  On my recent visit I ordered the Chicken Marsala which I really enjoyed. The sauce was delicious and was the right amount for the four small chicken breasts. I thought the amount of mushrooms in the dish was perfect as well. I liked the way the sauce worked it's way into the angel hair pasta. The portion was just enough that I had some leftover to enjoy at home later.   My husband ordered the Rigatoni with Sausage. The portion was large and covered with the perfect amount of cheese. He loved the dish. The pasta dishes also come with a Caesar Salad and he enjoyed this as well. I tried some of the salad and thought that the dressing tasted homemade and I liked the flavor a lot.   For dessert we split the Spumoni. Spumoni! I love that they even offer this as an option. Move over standard chocolate cake. The execution was even better than I expected and very tasty. I loved the pistachio and cherry flavors with the whippy cinnamon topping. Yum!  Hopefully next time we visit the service will be improved. I want to make this restaurant one of our regulars."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waitress stared to much at me.  And there was no seasonings in the food. The lasagna was the worst I've eaten. You ask for meat on it and they literally crumble cooked meat on top, smh. There chicken parm was ok but was missing taste. Wake up! Add some taste to your food."}
{"text":"READ ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND YOU WILL SEE WHY THIS IS A 1 STAR PLACE - BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE NEGATIVE STARS...  I decided to go here against my better judgement and I know why I never wanted to go back after the first visit.  The service was one of the WORST I have seen in this town which was the same as when we first went there.    We were there shortly after they opened, the food was just ok tasting the first time and I thought over priced for what you got.  This time, the food was the same no thrills food.  You can get a TV dinner in the store and throw it in the microwave and get the same taste as this food.  For a family place, you would think they would take more pride in the service and the food.  I guess because they are always running specials which seems to get seniors in, they feel like they don't have to go out of their way to impress you with good service and good food.    I will NEVER go back to this place again, it is not worth the time, money or atmosphere.  It was the WORST service by far in this town and the food almost equals the service...No bad feelings about giving this place a 1star, if there was a way to give it negative stars I would."}
{"text":"We REALLY wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it fell short.  The first four bottles we selected on the wine list were all out of stock. They were nice enough to offer us a bottle they did have at a lower price to make up for the inconvenience.  We had originally wanted a bottle of Italian wine though and ended up having a California Cab - not the end of the world but not the best foot to start out on. The food was ok, nothing was terrible but unfortunately nothing really stood out either.  Calamari was a tad rubbery.  Entrees were underwhelming.   We will head back to try the sushi place next door, looked packed!"}
{"text":"Annie's is an excellent Restaurant! Annie and staff are amazing, always putting their customers 1st and will do whatever it takes to make sure that you are happy!  Also will go well and beyond for customers that have disabilities or any special needs! I also have severe foods allergies, Annie  & Staff always make sure they get my order correct and have no problems cooking exactly what I can eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely WONDERFUL!  Service was good, very friendly and patient with my young nephew!  Food was amazing!  Very fresh and flavorful. It was a bit more expensive than the Italian chain restaurants but worth it, not to mention, let's support our local small businesses!  Can't wait for the weather to cool off to enjoy dinner on their patio!!"}
{"text":"The evening was gorgeous so we decided to dine out on the patio.  We received a basketful of warm, but tasteless rolls.  The house salad was odd to the extent that it was not tossed so the dressing nestled at the bottom of the bowl plus there were a pair of pepperoni slices on the top.  Our lasagna entrees were devoid of flavor as was the marinara sauce.  This meal probably plays well at someone's home, but was a pretty disappointing experience for us.   Prior to our departing, Annie stopped by to say hello"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed.  I live in the neighborhood and hoped for a place to frequent, but no.  I stopped in for happy hour - while the price was right, the food was not.  The stuffed roasted red peppers is a cold dish and lacking in flavor, perhaps if the basil wasn't presented as a large stalk it would have been easier to attempt to add flavor. Then came the trio which I was really looking forward to but again, no.  The only thing barely resembling warm was the marinara for dipping but the rest was barely room temperature.    Oh did I mention that the entrance to the bar area is completely hidden and just my luck the dish TV was not working, rather than the staff putting on some music (until I requested it) I had to listen to the incessant ramblings of an arrogant old woman customer about how she could get the TV fixed if she just called them.   Uh, I was just looking for a nice neighborhood place to relax after work...the search continues!"}
{"text":"WELL...  FOUR stars for Annie's Gourmet Italian... Exciting when a restaurant moves up in my \"rating\" world! FIRST I ordered a lovely chicken soup, Caesar salad & for my main course the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta! I found the gem, can't wait to go back and have it again! Really delicious and to top it off There actually is a Annie... Wonderful lovely BOSS LADY, came out introduced herself and prepared my meal to PERFECTION... GIOVANNI the attentive bartender/customer service KING... Recommended a fine Merlot I would have never ordered..(due to my total devotion to the PINOTS) and it was lovely! CERTAINLY order the Caesar salad... I did not have that on my first visit and its hands down TOP 5 Caesar salad in my mind! Not to mention I arrived right before closing and not ONE person complained... (To my face)! I love it when a plan comes together... I can't wait to visit next week and venture through Annie's menu. #theREALESTFoodieInTheLV My new food blog launches in 2 weeks"}
{"text":"While the service was great the food was less then that.  The chicken Marsala was bland and had a grainy texture.  The pasta was mushy.  This place has potential although I will not be back to see where it ends up.  With so many great Italian places in the area I wouldn't waste my time and money at this spot.  The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was again, the service was great."}
{"text":"Won a gift card to Annie's, since they stated they are pet friendly I took the dog and my dad along for the company. I had shrimp scampi and dad had sausage and peppers, dogs had chicken meatballs food was mediocre but I only had 3 shrimps on a bqed of tons of pasqta. The dog patio could be nice if they had picked up the previous dog poop as opposed to leaving it in the corner or throwing it in the b3ushes and the ground could be sprayed down with sanitizer to help eliminate the smell."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from uber for the first time and chose Annie's. I never even heard of this place which is crazy because I have lived in Henderson for 18 years and worked in many Italian restaurants back east and here. The menu looked amazing and I'm glad I made this my choice. I had a garden salad which was crisp fresh and the dressing was amazing.  I then had the chicken masala. That is one of my favorite dishes ever and they executed it perfectly (a lot of places cant). I truly enjoyed my meal. I look forward to actually dining in the establishment. Great job! Great find!"}
{"text":"First off, the waitress seated us and immediately poured oil and balsamic for the bread and yet, no bread came until after we ordered 15 minutes later.  (I hate when restaurants wait for you to order to bring out bread/chips!)  The bread they brought out were breadsticks that I swear I've had at some other restaurant.  If you're called 'gourmet' I expect you to be making and baking everything from scratch.  We ordered a cheese plate that consisted of cheese and crackers that I'm sure they bought at Wal-Mart.  Three different types of bland cheddar and a bland brie.  The Caesar Salad was literally the best part of the meal.  Shaved parmesean and what looked like homemade croutons.  (Really?  Homemade croutons but not homemade bread?)  I got Spaghetti and Meatballs and my wife ordered Fettucine Alfredo and we could have had less bland and much better food with the Classico that is in our pantry.  My meatballs were dry and the alfredo was very runny.  I went here because I had a Groupon and it's near my house but I probably wouldn't go back again.  I read the other reviews and let me say, the service was fine and we were seated right away.  The appetizer, salad, and entres all came out within a reasonable amount of time so there's no complaints there.  The decor and music were just fine but I really can't get past the food."}
{"text":"We went hoping the negative reviews were just a fluke unfortunately they are not.  The following dishes were ordered: Shrimp Scampi which was very bland and only having four shrimp although large, Chicken Mediterranean pasta - the chicken was very dry and pasta flavorless and Eggplant Parmigiana which was boring and flavorless.  We had 5 PM Saturday evening reservations which were clearly not needed since the place was empty however we still waited 10 minutes to be seated!  Could have been longer if a customer (one of the two tables) hadn't gone into the kitchen to let them know people were waiting!  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  There are plenty of other great Italian restaurants in the area with much better food!"}
{"text":"Lasagna tasted like stouffer's. No joke. It was horrible. Disappointed. Sounds like other items might have been actually prepared but not willing to pay the high prices to give it a second chance. Nice ambience though!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Nice waitstaff but slow service, took a long time to get our food.  Ordered  plenty of wine and appetizers and we were still hit with a $7 charge for splitting an entree, even though our bill was high because of the wine and the appetizers.  We received a small salad for that price, but it wasn't anything more that a split regular salad.  Won't go back and be nickled and dimed like that again."}
{"text":"Annie's is a favorite!   My fiance and I had our first date there and he proposed to me there!  The food is authentic and delicious!  Love the stuffed mushrooms, caesar salad and rice balls.  The food is always fresh and the service impeccable.  We'd love to have our wedding  there!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile...but love their new location in Smith's shopping center. Place is much larger and more to offer besides the GREAT FOOD!!! My hubby and I just had a fabulous meal and wine!! I loved everything from caesar salad to my Brie... And main courses baked rigatoni and hubby's chicken parm!!! Place is a must frequent spot on our list from now on!!! And icing on the cake \"owners are from Ct. Like myself!\" Please support local owned small biz! Make a difference...be the difference!!! God bless"}
{"text":"Stopped by with the family for some appetizers and drinks.  LOVE this place.  They are so great to my 3 year old son and he loves the food so it's a win for us!  The Rice Balls are amazing, as others have noted, and the Anitpasto platter is my fave too.  Ambiance is good, nice little patio and the staff was really friendly to us.  We didn't experience any of the problems that others have experienced.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We were driving by and decided to try it out. My Mother had been there and said it was awful, but we figured why not try. The place was busy for almost 8PM and the wait staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered the Antipasto Meat & Cheese tray. It came out in a nice presentation but Turkey & boiled Hormel Ham on an Italian Meat tray is wrong. The turkey and ham were lower quality store brands, the salami fair but the mozzarella was quite good but only a few pieces in the dish. We waited about an hour for our entree and I had the Veal and Peppers and my wife the baked Rigatoni. The veal was chewy, unflavored and only had 3 medallions in the dish maybe 3 oz of meat. The Peppers were mushy from overcooking and only seasoned with garlic. My wife's rigatoni was burned all over the top and hard (I like that) and had maybe 2 spoonfuls of over dried tomato sauce in the whole dish. Unappealing at best. She would have asked for more sauce but our waitress was no where to be found for almost 15 minutes so why bother? We expressed our unhappiness to the tune of sorry you didn't like it everyone else does? Can I get you dessert? No thanks even if it was on the house which it was not. I know some people love this place but we are not one of them. Overpriced for what you get and what you do not get which is good food."}
{"text":"I'd really like to report good things about this place, being they are a quaint family owned restaurant and I would like them to succeed...BUT, hmmm....where do I begin?!  Last night was the second time we went (both times with groupons, my husband and I bought one each.) and I do realize that the groupon was expiring in 2 days and they would be busy, but they should have been prepared.   First time we visited, a couple of months ago.  We thought, food was alright , NO FLAVOR REALLY, pricy but we have another groupon so we HAVE to come back.   So we recently returned and I wasn't too hungry so I got the rice balls.  First couple bite was good.  Then I got to the middle, it was still COLD, fine, microwave can solve that problem.  But, my husband ordered the 19.00 MEAT (NO FLAVOR I might add) lasagna and it came with NO meat!  So they took it all back.  He gets his lasagna back and they JUST GROUND SOME MEAT AND THREW IT RIGHT ON TOP OF HIS LASAGNA.  HOW TACKY!!!  If I had dinner guests at my house, I would NEVER serve something looking like that!  I probably should have taken a picture but we had been in there so long, I just wanted to leave.  One of my children got the kids alfredo, the pasta was still a little crunchy in the middle.   Needless to say, we won't be going back EVEN with a groupon!  It's very unfortunate because it was a cozy little place."}
{"text":"This is great hidden gem in the valley. The food is just like my grandmother.  The stuffed mushrooms,rice balls and eggplant have become my favorite.  The staff is also courteous and attentive. We will be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Unable to give less than 1 start. ..oh well.   Worst service I've ever experienced.  The bartender last night was rude,  short and overall seemed put out by any questions we had.   Waited about 30 minutes to get a table.  After being seated no one came over to us.  10 minutes went by,  then 20, then after 30 we got up and left. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, music and wine! Can't go wrong! Try the chicken marsala, it will change your life."}
{"text":"After waiting 45 minutes, the waitress came back and said \"no eggplant, sorry\"  Really!?  I hope they make it in their new place on Valle Verde."}
{"text":"They were very kind, and the service was great. However, the food is mediocre and expensive. Baked artichokes were delicious. Veal Marsala was bland and over cooked."}
{"text":"Was told this place was the best Italian in Henderson by mt step-daughter so though the wife and I would try it out last Friday night.  Overall impression was it's a cozy little place with great decor, decent appetizers (we had the sampler with calamari, cheese sticks and fried ravioli), and it was pretty good.  I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and the wife ordered the Chicken Parm.  Thumbs up on the Chicken Parm  Thumbs down on the Alfredo.... Fettuccini noodles were cooked probably 2-3 minutes under cooked so they were very, very chewy. I had to put quite a bit of tooth to them to get them chewed up. I probably only 3 bites and left the rest.  As the waiter came by at the end of the meal to collect our plates and ask if we needed 2 boxes to take the rest home, I said I didn't need one due to the undercooked noodles. The server/hostess was apologetic but neglected to even offer us a refund or take any price off the final bill.  Don't think we'll be back to this place, even though it's close to home.  2 of 5 Stars rewarded."}
{"text":"Yummy dishes. I had the chicken parm and the hubby had sausage and peppers, way good. I especially liked the breadsticks they bring, coated in butter and parmesan cheese. Great decor too, warm and not pretentious. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, we weren't offered a refill on our bread."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying that the food here is good, better than average in fact and would have received 4 stars if I were focusing on just the food.  However, there is more to a good restaurant than just the food.  From the moment we walked in until the moment our food came, this restaurant dropped 2 stars.  First, we walked in and there was no host/hostess.  We waited at least 2 minutes before someone behind what appeared to be a desert case asked who we were.  We had reservations and were put at two uneven tables, one which kept wobbling until we ended up using the other table as a stopper.  I preface the next set of comments with the fact that when we arrived there were four tables of people inside and 1-2 outside so the place wasn't near capacity.  Our waiter ignored us for at least 10 minutes before coming to take our order.  This wouldn't have been so bad had he provided us with menus first.  He arrived at our table without menus.  We had to ask for them.  He looked at us like we were stupid and then brought us some.  We didn't see him again for another 10 minutes. I don't know if there were any specials because the waiter didn't offer any.  He took our order and went away.  We watched other people get bread, even some who came in after us.  Finally, we practically tackled our waiter to beg for some bread which took another 5 minutes.    So time passed, after checking in on YELP, answering emails, making small talk and writing a novel, our salads arrived 45 minutes after we ordered.  another 15 minutes after we were done with the salad, the waiter came out to tell us we were next but only after we asked him to check.  So, summing up the bad, SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE and the WAITER HAD SLIGHTLY MORE PERSONALITY THAN A PENCIL.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that was the worst service I have had in what was considered a quality restaurant.  I will say the baked rigatoni was excellent.  The fettucini alfredo was good and the other diners said their food was good too. But after the long wait and bad service we were already disappointed with the place and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it."}
{"text":"We went here tonight and let me start by saying the best thing here was our lovely waiter Francisco. The place was completely empty.  Ordered dirty martinis because the wine list was extremely limited for an Italian restaurant.  Luckily we had a Groupon so it wasn't THAT painful.  But the food was not good,and also very overpriced. The tortellini Alfredo was from a frozen bag, with pasty sauce with no flavor.  My wife had the caprese salad, for $12.00-four slices of bland roma tomato with hard flavorless store bought cheese on top. We are not stupid. There is nothing gourmet here. Do yourselves a favor and drive down the street  4 blocks to eat at Ventanos."}
{"text":"Regular customer until tonight. Asked for manger 4 times, found out it was the owner and she refused to come to our table after being requested 4 times. Been 3 hours, still no dinner. Refused to comp or even discount my tab when we finally gave up."}
{"text":"I really debated between 2 stars and 3 stars.  I went with 3, as the food was good, however the service, while slow, was extremely friendly.  Menu is extremely limited.   Restaurant is pure italian, if you desire anything other than traditional Italian, there will be nothing for you.  For me, the food was good, but had very little flavor.   I sampled my wife's meal, and hers had more flavor than mine.    The biggest issue was the service.  It took nearly 30 minutes to get a single appetizer, then another 15-20 for simple salads, then that long again for our entrees.  From when we sat down, to when we finished eating, it was nearly 2 hours.  The worst part is, the restaurant was virtually empty.  I am sorry to say we will not be back.  It was simply too slow."}
{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---  One night last week, I wanted a quick bite so I used Open Table to find somewhere close by that I had not yet visited. I came across Annie's which really caught my eye. After a little poking around I discovered they had a great happy hour which included 1/2 price appetizers and some drink specials ($2 off wine).   As I entered, I was blinded from the Las Vegas sun so it took a minute for my eyes to adjust to the dimly lit setting. The friendly host asked where I wanted to sit, I asked the bar since I was by myself. I was a little confused since I didn't see any bar.  She proceeds to the back of the room where she opens a hidden door into the small, intimate bar they called The Lost Weekend.   I was greeted by a very nice bartender who was very quick to greet me and prompt to get my order. I went with the sampler or \"trio\" which included fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and friend ravioli. This was more then enough food to make it an entree. I was absolutely stuffed to the gills when I left! Everything was pretty good! I would like to return to try their homemade meatball scampi appetizer, everyone was ranting and raving about it. So I will be returning!"}
{"text":"False advertising all the way around. First of all, to be gourmet, you need to offer more than just a tapenade to go on your bread. The bread was dry, cold and nothing to get excited over. The caesar salads were so bland we began to question if they had just put mayo on them for dressing. The entrees were not good. Tomato sauce that tasted like it had not been cooked down at all. Just open a can and pour out tomatos. No real spices/ flavoring. The pasta was ho hum. Tasted like it had been bagged and poured out on a plate. I ordered the riggatoni. It came floating on about a cup of water. Don't they drain the pasta????  Don't waste your time or money. There are much better places in town."}
{"text":"So happy they added pizza to their menu! Just had their artichoke, spinach, mushroom pizza...awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night. I usally hate going to Italian restaurants because I'm Italian, so I generally find that the Italian restaurants are lacking in the quality of their food. But Annie's was Amazing. Their food was delicious. You get large portions, and the service was phenomenal. The prices are good also. They have a nice outdoor seating area also, where you are welcome to bring your dogs. In this courtyard setting is a huge tree dedicated to their dog, Ookie. They call it Ookie's garden. During the nicer weather, I would definately encourage sitting out there.  I will be returning to Annie's often, now that I know how good it is."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit Annie's every so often. We order the same thing every time. She orders the Chicken Marsala and holds it as the best Marsala she's ever had and I could and would eat the Gnocci for 3 meals a day, 7 days a week. The ambiance and hospitality are always what you want from a owner/chef environment. Annie is always welcoming and eager to please your palette and Giovanni has mastered his craft around the bar. I opted out of my favorite beer they have on tap for one of his recommendations and, well, I guess I have a new favorite beer.  In short. Great food, great environment for a casual dinner or formal event and great people...... What else could you want!?"}
{"text":"Terribly slow. We were a party of 6 and walked in at 6pm. Ordered appetizers right away, ordered our dinner right when appetizers were delivered. Finished our appetizers, an hour later we still had not received our dinner. Now 8pm, annoyed that we have been here 2 hours and had no food. Other people were coming in after us and getting served and leaving and we still have not gotten our dinner. We asked to see a manager and were told there is no manager. Asked to see the owner and she refused to come out, she sent the bartender out to talk to us. We are regular customers and we will never come back. We even had to go find someone to refill our waters. Note they were NOT busy. The owner REFUSED to come to the table. Absolutely refused."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday and we have a really good time nice place nice service what to Oslo will the only one there by 8 30...pm Jim was frendly , attentive accommodating but once again not too much fun it on the empty restaurant please people support the place and go there its a nice place now in the strip casino Trap  lol .... Use the Gruponn good deal .... And tip well that way we can get great service. ..."}
{"text":"Very nice server, average food Small but very nicely decorated restaurant. Wife liked her eggplant parm, very hot and fresh.  My baked rigatoni was average. Delicious and fresh antipasto plate, Very clean place with a family owned atmosphere.  Our server was friendly and seemed to be sincerely interested in our satisfaction. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"My quest for delicious authentic italian food has hit another brick wall. Definitely no \"gourmet\" at Annies gourmet Italian. I will say I liked the atmosphere and decor inside, but that's about it. We were the only ones in the restaurant for dinner which should probably be a clue.   The waitress took a while to come over to us. We both ordered the rigatoni Which came with Caesar salad. We also received a basket of bread but we did not care for it. It seemed stale and just warmed up, not actually baked at the restaurant. The Caesar was pretty good with shaved Parmesan cheese and a couple croutons but nothing special.   As far as the rigatoni it was a huge disappointment. It was served In a bowl with just some cheese and sauce on top. The majority was dry rigatoni shells. Both of ours were also cold in the middle. Even after trying to mix the small amount of sauce and cheese all together it was still very dry with hardly any flavor. Annies is also way over priced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend that lives in Henderson.  I liked the decor and the music they were playing (Andrea Bocelli) during dinner. The restaurant was also packed on a Tuesday evening, but luckily we made a reservation and did not have to wait too long.  We ordered their fried calamari and the Rice Balls (Arancini Di Riso) as our appetizer, and since the restaurant was all out of chicken we ordered a Veal Marsala.  The Rice Balls (Arancini Di Riso) was something I have never had before, and it was the highlight of our dining experience here.  I recalled reading another comment about getting two orders of this and have that as the entire meal.  I too think that is an excellent idea.  The Fried Calamari appetizer was an EPIC FAIL. It came out looking like it was left unattended in the fryer, and was rescued from the scolding oil after it was completely crispy and dark brown, but not completely burnt. If it was a kitchen mishap by inexperienced culinary students learning to fry food, I can totally understand.  Newbies tend to overfry/cook fried calamari, instead of flash frying them.  But after tasting it, and discovering the not-so-pleasant fishy after-taste, indicative of seafood that has started to turn or already completed the left turn, I believe it was intentional and to mask the lack of freshness in the calamari.  I usually finish everything, but we opted to left half of the calamari on the plate and asked to have it taken away.  The Veal Marsala was okay.  It came with a buttery Marsala sauce and pieces of sauteed white mushrooms, and a side of spaghetti.  The consistency of the sauce would be graded a C+/B- at best in my Saucier class, and I definitely have had better Marsala Sauce at the Cheesecake Factory. Overall, there is nothing to really complain or praise about this dish.  It was just very \"homemade\".    Service was good.  We did not take too long reaching a decision for what we were going to order, and the bread basket and order we brought out in a timely manner, even when the restaurant was packed.  So if service was an issue in the past, it has since been resolved.  In conclusion, I thought we had a decent dining experience in all aspects of dining out, excluding the food.  The food experience spanned the full spectrum of \"Oh my gato, that's terrible\" to \"it's alright\" to \"Yes, I would totally recommend that!\"  But with the overweight on \"food\" score, it only gets a 2 stars.  The restaurant does have potential. And I respect the fact that they want to honor their family's recipes, but taste change overtime as should some recipes. Clinging to the sacred family heirloom recipes for the sake of doing so, is IMO a mistake.  If the customer constructive feedback is decidedly less than positive, it is only wise to be open-minded and see if updating the recipe is needed.   P.S.  Thank you Andy T and Li Ly."}
{"text":"omg seriously i waited at the hostess stand for about 10min finally got seated another 10 min go by before a waiter comes by...   50 min later we get our food, the worst was a couple came 15 min after us and got their food first..   the lasagne medioker  one of the worst places i have ever been too"}
