{"text":"Not sure if I have the right restaurant, only because it's amazing that it would have no reviews. The steak here was probably the best I've ever had. I can't remember what all the menu had to entail however. When we walked in (party of 15) there was a nice couple sitting nearby who told me that \"I HAD to get the steak\" and that they \"eat there quite often and spend about $300 a week\"...holy shit they must like steak. anyways, I ordered an 8oz fillet, medium rare with shoestring onions and baked potato. VERY GOOD. I had no complaints except that they had only filled my wine glass 1/3 of the way up like I was in some sort of a tasting room, but whatever- I had 3 glasses. Service was good and they served my party rather quickly. The calamari is AWESOME and the crab cakes were good too. I'm giving this place 4 out of 5, until I get confirmation this is the right restaurant."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, and the first few times we went, it was nice.  A bit out of date, but the food was good and we generally had good experiences.  Last year when we got our tax return, we decided to celebrate there.  Our waitress was a bit too chatty, and at first, we just ignored her.  At one point early in our visit, I went outside with a friend to smoke (there were still people at our table), and she made a \"dine and dash\" joke (I assume it was a joke), which rubbed me the wrong way.  When we returned, she had brought out the wrong bottle of wine and some how this became our fault and a joke between her and other servers?!?  She was strange and the evening got weirder as time went on.  At the end of the night, she asked if we came to the restaurant often, and I mentioned we did on occasion and we were celebrating our tax return.  After we had paid our bill and were leaving she made an off color comment, saying she hoped we had enough money to come back.  A few months later we went back for burgers at the bar after work, and she happened to be hostessing, and she remembered us.  She said she was happy to see we had enough of our tax return left to come back.  I seriously don't know if she was kidding or a total jerk.  We are always dressed appropriately and tip well, maybe she doesn't understand why anyone under 65 would dine there.  We will unfortunately never will be going back again......."}
{"text":"Mediocre Food, awful service.

Went there last night, hungry for a good steak. The atmosphere was initially cool, with a guy in the center playing piano. Once we sat down, things quickly deteriorated.
 
The place was not busy, yet our waitress took a good 15 minutes to get our first drinks...then another 15 to take our order. She pretty much ignored us the rest of the time, and instead joked around with the cooks and bartender.
 
My order was simple: an 8 oz Fillet Mignon, cooked medium. The steak came out CHARRED, and though the very center of the steak was OK, everything else was crispy. I've had better steak at Applebee's.
 
Even the salad was lacking, just generic, hardly fresh lettuce.
 
Basically, I could have prepared a better dinner myself, for a fraction of the price. And I'm not a professional chef by any means.
 
To top things off, a group of rowdy men came in for a dinner towards the end of our lackluster meal. After a bit, one turned and loudly insulted us for reasons undefined. Nobody did anything about this. We eventually left our table, and took another near the bar. Our server came over, we told her what happened, and she just laughed it off.
 
This is hands-down the worst dining experience I've had in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Well i'm 36 yrs old and I just met my father for a couple xmas ales.  He told me I really effed up the demographic here.  Senior happy hour.  He was not lying either.  When I was walking in I actually held the doors for a train of elderly with walkers.  As for the food many years ago I ate here and it was really good, but since it was so long ago I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending it.  I will recommend the place to if your looking to check out various styles of walkers and canes.."}
