{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   Nagomi Sushi is a completely unexpected delight in an unassuming corner of a plaza near Bathurst and Steeles. The prices are reasonable: expect to pay $10 for a special roll, $5-8 for a specific maki, or $12-15 for a sushi combo.  The chef makes a point of using large, fresh, tasty pieces of sushi on appropriately sized rice. This is the way sushi should be, unlike the giant rice balls many popular sushi joints pass off to ravenous customers.  Lovely decor, pleasant atmosphere with plenty of seating, consistently good service.  4 stars"}
{"text":"I went to here, because this web site rating is quite high. I was disappointed this restaurant and this web site authenticity. if there is minus - star, I want to minus 5 star. We order  Calvi BBQ rice combo $14- and sushi sashimi roll(maki) boat for 2 people $44 and 2 beer total was $87-. Calvi came quickly but we have to wait for boat 30 minutes. My wife said Calvi is good, but for me it is just a oily beef BBQ. and there are a lot of California roll on the boat, rice was squashed and big avocado was inside. half of boat is the roll. When I went to washroom, I felt stinky, fishy smell, from kitchen. I have bad feeling at that time. That came 2 hours later. me and my wife had to go wash room so many times.  I went sushi restaurant many times. here is worst. If you don't mind to spend more money, I recommend \" Aoyama \"(finch and Victoria park) or \" Miyabi\"(highway7 and West Beaver Creek. Those are run by Japanese."}
{"text":"What happened here?  All new staff on our last visit.  The food was still good, but I really liked the old chefs.  Does anyone know where they went?"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been to!  The service was spectacular and very friendly.  The chef was fantastic and even asked personally how the meal was (phenomenal).  We eat sushi fairly often (probably 3-4 times a month) and this is by far the best place we've been to yet.  I commented to my husband that my tuna roll was more fish than anything else, not a giant pile of rice with a thin slice of fish like your run of the mill place. The chef was great, and even sent an incredibly carved apple to our table after the meal.  We will most certainly be going back.  The decor and atmosphere are wonderful, staff are fantastic and the food is top notch!  Prices are great, and  VERY reasonable for what you get!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wide selection of rolls.  Service was quick and the waitress was uber friendly.   I'm just disappointed that the Viagra roll's colour isn't blue. =)"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST sushi I've had in the GTA or Toronto for that matter. Extremely fresh, great and friendly service, and prompt take out.  I literally cannot eat sushi anywhere else, as I constantly compare it to Nagomi.  They have awesome spicy tuna hand rolls, and the spicy tempura rolls are also a favourite of mine!"}
{"text":"best sushi in the GTA. the staff are really friendly"}
{"text":"Great place for those who appreciate the real sushi and not the rice balls we're used to expect. You come to Nagomi for the freshest fish and one of a kind sushi rolls, created by chef Joon. Honestly, you've got to try their Deluxe Maki, unique combination of flavors will haunt you for a long time, my favourite is \"Love Love Roll\" (salmon, tuna, avocado and fish egg wrapped in seaweed and lightly fried, served warm with spicy mayo and teriyaki sauce drizzled on top...yamm). The sashimi selection is also great with 3 kinds of salmon(pacific  is delish), 4 kinds of tuna and hamachi(yellow tail) and many more. An important aspect is also the quality of food they serve, you can tell they have used the best ingredients, fish is always so fresh, ginger is white never coloured crazy pink, salad dressing is house made. And yes, they do take out as well. They are a bit on the pricey side, but you will enjoy every bite and won't regret a dime spent at Nagomi."}
{"text":"After a 3 month nagomi binge, (3 times a week) it just makes sense to write a quick review.   Jon and Joon are awesome, everything is super fresh. They have the best \"spicy\" combination I have ever tasted.   I had them invent my own roll, which is the spicy hamachi. It is heaven upon earth, with buttery and delicate hamachi (the king of the tuna's) melding perfectly with the spicy stuff they use. Unreal.  Snapper,Flounder and Tako are also favourites of mine. The only thing I can say against it is it tends to get expensive, which is weird because its in thornhill (hell on earth) and the decor inside doesnt speak much. I still give the food 5 stars and the service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Nagomi Sushi is owned by Koreans and serves both Japanese and Korean fare.  The inside is nicely decorated with Japanese items and the waitress wear a Kimono looking outfit and so are the sushi chefs in their Japanese outfits.  They do offer reasonably priced lunch specials from $7.99. We decide to order Sushi Platter ($11.99) and Kalbi Bento Box ($9.99) so we can try both their Japanese and Korean food.  The fish selection of the sushi is just not too exciting since 4 of them are Salmon and the other 4 pieces are different fish and comes with Cali roll. The fish is cut quite big in portion to the rice. The Cali roll were rolled too loose because of the big avocado and they are falling apart when we try to pick them up with our chopsticks.  The BBQ ribs are quite tender and has a good marinated favour. I wouldn't mind ordering it again when I come back for a visit.  We really enjoyed the food, but they are A-OK but not WOW me! Both orders were nicely presented.. My sushi was served on this big boat :).  The service is attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back when I am in the area.  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
