{"text":"Went to this winery expecting another northern Ohio sweet wine and was blown away by their wine! They do not have a local vineyard, they make wine from grapes from places like CA, OR, WA.  The Pinot Grigio was phenomenal. I came in for a glass of wine and walked out with a wine club membership - you have to try it!"}
{"text":"We went to the opening this weekend and WOW what a cool place!  I loved the unique Cleveland names and labels for the wine, and the Pino Grigio was one of the best I've had. And they have wine slushies!!

There is local art in the walls, comfy areas to sit, and a large bar. It's also fun that you can see into the room where they bottle wine. 

We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I walked into this place randomly one night after dinner across the street. First, we were pretty clueless.. so we decided to sit at the bar to see what this place was all about. I decided to do the wine tasting. I tried 5 of the sweeter wines. It was actually all pretty good. My favs were the Riesling and the peach Chardonnay, so I got a bottle of both. It was about 15 dollars a bottle. There were tables and couches just to relax in, and even games towards the back. It was a great vibe, and the bartender made the whole experience even better for us. Loved it, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was great . Bring your own food. Have a small party. Wine tasting and teaching . Good wine. The ladies that work there was great and helpful with wine"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible wine, and other people in the establishment told us to be quiet when we were playing board games so they could listen to the sub-par live music"}
{"text":"In town visiting and we drove by this place. I knew I had to try it! They blend and bottle their own wines - right here in CLE. More wines are being added as they continue to grow. Taste a few, then pick a glass (or bottle) to enjoy at one of the many tables or on the couches."}
{"text":"Wine was good... Atmosphere is fun! Love the idea. Only Ohio winery that makes sells a good Cabernet that I know of. Will definitely stop in again when I'm in town. 

If it wasn't for M Cellers being do amazing I'd give it 5 stars! I feel a little spoiled after I was introduced  to M Cellers. 

Really like this place as well 4 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome spot! My favorite time to go to CLE Urban Winery is either before or after dinner on Lee Rd (although you can bring food into the winery- lots of people order takeout Dewey's pizza to enjoy with their wine!) They have a great selection of different types of wine, but what I've been most impressed by are their fruit fines, both the Hometown Heroes Peach Chardonnay and the Blackberry Merlot. They're phenomenal! 

In the winter, we also like the Blackberry Merlot hot chocolate. It's great to cozy up with a warm drink while listening to some great live music. 

This place is a gem on Lee Rd. and not to be missed!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try them for an after work night.  We both work on the East side but live on the West side so I was glad to have someone willing to check out some \"eastern\" venues.  Immediately upon walking in you realize the space is much larger than the storefront implies.  I was greeting right away, and had a great conversation with the owner and bartender.  When we asked about food they plopped a whole Bible down in front of us with all the varying options in the area, and who delivers right to your seat.  The cheese and cashew spread we bought from the winery was plenty tasty, but keep in mind it is served picnic style in the packages, just as if you had gone to a market and purchased.  So if you want things pre cut and \"pretty\", keep it in mind. Frankly, I was glad for the options and the fact that my purchase went to an entire container of cashew spread instead of 2 TB in a bowl.

On to the wine, I enjoyed the varieties that I choose.  Some were a little sweet for my preference, however this was made clear to me prior to choosing and I just decided to try anyway.  Several reds were robust and bold and do not have the \"Ohio grape\" flavor you would expect with a local winery.  From my knowledge these are NOT Ohio grapes, so the wine is just as diverse as you would expect when ordering bottles from another establishment.  

All in all, if you like wine in a cool urban setting, you need to give them a try!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the Lee Rd dining scene. Four of us stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon and we enjoyed ourselves so much we spent 2 hours there. Two of us had wine slushies made with the house rose-a great combination of sweetness and alcohol. The other two had wine flights and sampled 4 wines, then settled on a Reisling and a Syrah. We supplemented with cheese and crackers and had a wonderful impromptu dinner. The wines were perfectly fine, the owner waited on us and chatted with us, and all in all, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"No food. Great wines. All types for all types of taste. Lots of variety. Not too pricey. Entertainment on weekends. You can meet friends and bring your own pizza or food. Not bad."}
{"text":"Nothing but nice things to say about this unique spot. My fiancé and I came for a tango class and it was really fun! 

The staff was nice and the one wine we tried (Pinot Noir) was good. There are a few food options, but I wouldn't recommend showing up very hungry, although there are quite a few food options nearby. 

The vibe was urban and fun, yet relaxed at the same time. There were games you could play too. It'd be a nice stop for a glass of wine before dinner and worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"This place has such a great vibe! They're able to infuse amazing craft wine made right there in house, incredible live music from the best in town, graffiti art on the walls, art for sale and a chill vibe . 

Unlike most Ohio wines, the wine here is appropriate to how red and white wines should taste. The reds are perfectly flavored and dry-semi-sweet, the whites are brilliantly flavorful hitting all the right taste buds.

This is a great place for someone coming for an after work drink, a place to take the girls for a Friday night hang out or a place to impress your out of town buddies on a Saturday! 

One word: LOVE"}
{"text":"This is the chillest, friendliest, tastiest wine bar I've been to in a long time. The people who work here are great at dealing with everyone from sommelier-wannabes to total wine-n00bs, and the atmosphere is laid-back and open, with plenty of tables, couches, barstools, and some nice live music on the weekends. 

My friend and I stopped in just to check it out, but we wound up staying through a flight, a half-dozen wine-infused donut holes, two glasses of additional wine, a glass of mulled wine, and a cheese board. We've already made plans to come back with some Mexican take-out (did I mention that they encourage people to bring food, if they want to?), which should pair well with the North Coast Syrah that we both loved. 

Honestly, even if you're not a \"wine person,\" this is just a fun place to hang out, eat, and find some new favorite drinks with friends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite wine spot! I honestly love everything about this place- the wines are all delicious, the staff are super nice and helpful, the bar itself is lovely... If I could complain about anything, it's the fact that it isn't located closer to me!

The first time I visited, my friend and I opted for two wine tasting flights- for science, of course! Now, I normally aim for the sweeter (erm, \"candy\") type wines, but even the stronger, drier wines were still really good. Each time we thought we found our favorite, the next one impressed us even more. We each left with a couple of bottles- for sharing, of course!

I definitely recommend Cle Urban Winery, and also suggest checking their Facebook page for cool events they're hosting. There always seems to be some kind of art/music/yoga/etc. going on there!"}
{"text":"I love that they're making their own wines in Cleveland heights! Some of their offerings are pretty sweet, but I found a few drier varietals that I enjoyed (they only serve and sell their own wines). They also have wine slushies, snacks, and a good sized board game selection if you want to make it a night. Good for a lazy weekend hangout with friends. The classes posted on their Facebook page also look like fun!"}
{"text":"Really great place to meet friends. Urban decor with lovely wines made on-site. Thinking of joining the wine club to enjoy the delicious wines all year round. The live music on Friday and Saturday's is an added bonus. Our favorite was the chardonnay but our friends' loved the pinot noir. Love that we were able to order from any of the great restaurants along Lee Rd. or bring our own snacks. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"WINE SLUSHIE! Seriously, do I need to say more? The wine slushie was delicious and I would love to have one of those machines in my apartment! They also have really cool wine flights, and since I am not a wine expert, I allowed the staff to choose the wines for me. She chose wisely. 

Even though I wish they had some outside seating, and the parking around the area is a nightmare, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had a sneak preview of their wines and was very impressed.  Looking forward to their grand opening!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Cedar Lee district! I don't drink a ton of wine - I don't even like it all that much - but I really like this place. The space is very cool...great artwork, interesting decor. I love how there's a big window where you can look into the winemaking space. The atmosphere is terrific. The bar area is nice and there's plenty of space if you have a small group and want to hang together. The service is very good. The servers are attentive and knowledgeable without being \"wine snobs\". Oh, and the wine is pretty good, too! After trying a wine flight and talking about wine with my server, it actually made me want to take one of the winery's classes. I definitely recommend the CLE Urban Winery, even if you aren't a wine lover."}
{"text":"Now... I love my wine. But this place is nothing less than perfect for wine lovers. Not only do they distill their own wine, but it's so freaking good! I just joined their wine club ( which is a must) they charge your card one a month for 2 bottles of wine, which you get to sample at a wine mixer every 2nd Wednesday of the month. The Pinot Grigio is my fave. The best part is the place is a BYOF, so bring a picnic basket full of food and buy some wine and chill! The staff is always friendly too! 

If you in the area and need a chill spot this is the place to go! I would also try the bourbon barrel led red blend  it gave me a whole new meaning to life lol"}
{"text":"I don't typically associate Ohio with wine, but CLE Urban Winery is a great little place!  Most of the grapes come to the winery from the west coast, but a few are from vines in the area.  The wines are made on site, and we really enjoyed a few of them.  The viogner was particularly good.  They also had a dry-hopped wine and as hipster-y as that sounds, it was actually pretty delicious.  Wine tasting is reasonably priced at $8 for five samples.  They offer a few snacks like cheese and crackers, but also allow you to get delivery or takeout, and the Cedar-Lee area has plenty of options in that department.  Staff is knowledgeable and the atmosphere is pleasant.

Definitely worth checking out if you find yourself in the area!"}
{"text":"The house wines are great. Try the rust belt rose if you are into sweet wines. Love it. The atmosphere is very open and warm. They have an area where you can watch the wine being made. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly.  This may be the new date night."}
{"text":"O.M.G. Go support this local gem. 

It's got an industrial/urban vibe. The mural is gorgeous! It's an open and lofty space with big windows at the front of the establishment; it all just works.

You can see into the room where they do all the bottling. And I'd love to be there just to witness a little bit of the process. 

The location is great for me - I love that it's in Cleveland Heights. (This is a dangerous thing, of course, I could easily be here all the time!) 

They offer a great tasting option that provides a wonderful introduction to their wines. At the time that I went - I could have picked 5 of the 7 available wines to taste test in a flight for the same price as a carafe of wine. (5 2oz pours for $15 dollars is NOT a bad deal at all.) Honestly, I think I'm going to have to do this next time I go. 

The service was exemplary. I was greeted by a smiley face that was approachable and knew what she was talking about. She was attentive and she wasn't pushy. GOD, I LOVE staff like this. I mean, to walk into a place and receive that type of treatment within the first minute, is rare. So, kudos to the owner for picking an awesome chic to help her out!

The wine was great! I struggled between ordering a glass of Chardonnay or Syrah and I'm so glad I got the Syrah. It's the owner's favorite wine and it's actually blended with a bit of her cabernet too. I feel like I could easily be a self-proclaimed wine aficionado, so I'll spare you my take on the taste of it. All the more reason for you to go and experience the wines yourself!

Lastly, the owner was there and we got to chat for quite a while. She is extremely knowledgeable about what she's providing and she is SO passionate. She's a real person in there doing what she loves and that was so captivating. It's great to see an ambitious woman owning her own business and doing her own thang and taking names while she does it. 

I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Always have live music and great wine. They do not charge a corkage fee, and you can bring in food from other restaurants."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I came here for a special wine and food pairing class ($27 including a processing fee) and I must say, we all really enjoyed the class! It was held in a room off to the side and each group had their own table set up and ready to go with several wine and food samples. Our instructor was very personable and did a pretty decent job of going through her slide show, explaining the different kinds of wine, and answering my random questions. As she talked we would try a wine and food pairing and discuss if the flavors brought out the best in each other (like pinot noir with a wild mushroom ravioli, or riesling with a grilled shrimp on a sliced cucumber with peach habanero preserves). At the end we got to do some experimenting and deciding on our own what cheeses would taste best with what wines. 

I didn't really care for most of the wine, but to be fair I prefer sweet reds or Moscato. I was also a bit disappointed that they get their grapes from California, but I was told this was due to timing (and familiarity with a business out there) and they might look around for grapes closer to home for the next batches. I did like the layout of this place, it's got that laid-back/stylish/industrial vibe to it and I could definitely see myself coming back to enjoy a wine slushie. Right down the road is a public parking lot and garage so a ton of parking you just have to have some quarters and walk 2 minutes.

If they offer anymore classes (check their facebook page) I would highly recommend checking one out!"}
{"text":"This place is in a great location, and it has a really nice atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful. Presentation of the wine flights is very cute. There's lots of space to hang out, and it's quiet enough to chat and hang out. The wines really leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Always a great vibe as soon as you walk in the door. The workers are always polite and knowledgeable about their wines. The wine flights are decent pricing and so worth it. They always seem to pick the right musicians for the entertainment. 

Your allowed to bring your own food which is perfect because there are restaurants up and down Lee road. This will continue to be one of my favorite wine spots."}
{"text":"CLE Urban Winery is the perfect happy hour locale. The staff know their stuff and the wine really is great!

Try the rose - either as a wine slushie or in its simple wine form. It's something very special if you like sweet wine :) 

Andd... may I suggest bringing pizza from Dewey's over to add to your experience? I love wine spot because they welcome outside food into their environment. They truly believe in indulging their patrons and doing everything they can to ensure you're having a great experience.

OH - AND you can rent their space for free! My friend had a party here and they were incredibly accommodating. Beautiful space + friendly staff + TASTY wine = great party!"}
{"text":"OH my goodness!  I was so excited to finally try this place out!  I have been following them on social media ever since they opened.

The organization that I volunteered for had their Young Professionals mixer at the winery and it is truly a great place to hold an event.

The décor is so cute and fits the theme of the winery.  They have everything that represents Cleveland to the T.  Which I absolutuely love!

They have a great selection of local wines and snacks.  You can also bring in outside food if you like.  Which is always a plus!

I tried the peach wine!!!!!!!!!  And let me tell you it was very refreshing.  I highly suggest you trying it.  The group I was with really enjoyed the blackberry wine and the wine slushy.  Even though I didn't try any of their food, I did take note that they had vegan dipping cheese!!!!  I am already planning a friend date to come back and try it.

OH and you can purchase bottles of wine and take it home with you!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 Stars great place great location there's a parking lot right across the street the staff is knowledgeable and very hospitable"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've shown up and the door is locked and the place is closed! According to their hours on Yelp (which I use for everything) they opened at 2pm. 
Second time! I hate this reflected my previous review from a 5 star to a 4 star. But, this is extremely inconvenient when I have to drive 10 plus miles just to get to this winery. 
I would recommend you fix your hours. I enjoy giving your wines as gifts and I have a party this evening and need 7 bottles."}
{"text":"I went here with my roommate on a whim and absolutely loved it! The ambiance is casual, fun, and modern and is a great location to go on a date or just hang out with friends. The wine is locally made which is just fantastic and the staff were helpful in helping us pick wines that suit our tastes. I think the bar snacks and board game collection are a wonderful addition to this establishment and I cannot wait to frequent this winery more often!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  There was live music, wine filled donuts and a great staff. This is the kind of place I've been looking for. If you're very hungry, bring your own food. Otherwise, there are limited snacks here. But the focus is on the drinks and it shows. Lots of tasty options, including wine slushies. Pleasant crowd of all ages and genders. I'm going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"After coming here for a Yelp event, I keep finding myself coming back. Its a nice laid back place where you can chill and have a nice glass of wine over some nice conversation and even music if they are playing it. you can also bring in your own food if you want to go with your wine. I joined the wine club which has a monthly gathering of tastings and be the firsts ones with a bottle of some new wine before the public. every wine is locally made which is a nice plus, so its like you giving back to the city while enjoying the city. Def should check this place out."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with friends. Let me start by saying, I absolutely love the atmosphere! It was a fairly busy night, however the open floor plan didn't make it feel crowded at all. My friends and I were easily able to get a table. They have a bunch of fun games to play including Cards Against Humanity (my personal favorite) and Heads Up. They also had a musician playing some chill tunes. 

I was able to try 3 of their wines (Cabernet, Merlot, and Pinot Grigio) and while I don't have huge expectations for local wines, I was throughly impressed! They also have a red wine slushy that I hope to try next time. 

My only knock is that it only stays open until 11PM. Cleveland Urban Winery is one of my new favorite spots in the city. I will definitely be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on opening day and the place was packed! It was great to see so many people out supporting this new business. Despite the large crowd, it was pretty easy to order a drink at the bar. I tried the Pinot Grigio - my fiance tried the Cabernet. Both were pretty solid. 

We didn't have a chance to order food but I saw a few vegan items on the menu that I'd like to try. I definitely want to go back when they have their full menu of wines available! (when I went, they had only a smaller selection)

This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I hope that they continue to do well!"}
{"text":"Opening night...615 pm...place is full...not packed but barely an open seat....they are understaffed for the amount of people here and it unfortunately shows...but its opening night you get a pass from me....after waiting about 20 minutes to place an order i cleared the dishes from a table so we had a place for our brischetta board and flight....the food was interesting and what was described was not what was delivered....expected toasted bread with brischetta....received crackers with mason jar toppings. One being tomato based..one olive based...i hate olives....one chick pea based which was good and a mystery one neither of us are sure of.but wasn't bad...the saving grace is definitely the wine...booze holds a special place in my heart and the reason they get 4 stars instead of 3....the cab sav and pinot were delightful and the rest of the 5 wines tried were good...which included the cedar lee chardonnay..pinot noir...and syrah...the only other downfall is the deciving wine menu...with 11 wines they only had 6 available to try...we will be back and soon"}
{"text":"I'm very excited about the potential in this new Lee Road business. Ordered some food at Momo's kebabs across the street then made my way into the winery. Beautiful space, well decorated, spacious, hip joint. Not very busy, but it was a Wednesday. Bellied up to the bar and the owner introduced herself right away, gave us some info on the ordering process and we placed our order. She was making small talk with other customers and forgot to pour our flight for about 10 minutes. This may have been the only flaw in the experience. The wines are spectacular. They're not aged in oak, so the brightness of the fruits really pops through in the wine. We ended up purchasing a few of our favorites and went on our merry way.

Favorite things: owned and operated by a woman who also happens to be a vet! The space is great. The wine is spectacular. Reasonably priced. They have some snacks to order, but you can bring in outside food (bonus!!)
Only improvement: have all of the wines available (still in production, I think.) Don't forget to pour the wine. 
Will continue to patronize this place, it's fab!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Spot.  They make all their own vino.  I recommend doing a tasting but really they are all delish."}
{"text":"My wife and I love CLE Urban Winery and highly recommend this spot! Not only is the wine great (my favorite is the North Coast Syrah), but this is one of those places with an atmosphere that makes you feel welcome from the moment you walk in the door.
 
If you are going to check out this winery for the first time, I recommend grabbing a seat at the bar. Destiny and her staff are clearly educated and passionate about what they do and in my experience, are willing to answer customer questions about the winery, the wine making process, or wine in general. If you are interested in asking these types of questions, I would probably recommend going during the week as the weekends are busier.
 
Cheers to another great addition to the Cleveland community!"}
{"text":"Came here two nights in a row- I love it! The ladies here are funky, friendly and so much fun. I've brought people here for a date, just for fun and next week week I'm taking my family!

The reds are real good here- definitely recommend the cab sav. If you like sweet whites, they have a few that are awesome too! 

Planning on joining their wine club so I have a reason to go more often!"}
{"text":"It is great to see a winery open in the city! I am so excited to go back here.

I was attending for a casual gathering with a young alumni group and they had a whole area reserved for us which was wonderful! The atmosphere is super relaxed with lots of board games to play and the staff is super helpful, willing to give tours/answer questions. They are really trying to program the space and weeknights with a variety of different activities - cornhole, live music, classes.

I started out with the \"guided tasting\" - (5) 1oz pours served by the staff in order from sweet to dry (you get to choose your wines). I chose the Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Pinot Noir, Cab Sav, and Syrah. They were all phenomenal and unique - I would have ordered a full glass of any of them. I later got a glass of the Peach Chardonnay which I really enjoyed. 

It's a great place for a small or large gathering, to sit at the bar by yourself, or just a date night. You can purchase snacks or bring in food from outside. (They even have a binder of carry out menus for you to look at)."}
{"text":"So impressed! I wasn't sure what to expect but everything I tried was great!

The inside is modern and industrial and the staff is very helpful! I love great (not super sweet) white wine and they are nailing that! 

I wish they weren't on the east side so I could visit more often! I mean, kind of. Because if they were on my side of town I would hang out there everyday and that would look bad soooo......  

Go check out their wine! Good prices! Great white and red and staff that will tell you their story. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"Favorite place to walk too when I am home and want a relaxed drink during the week. The bartenders are always friendly, I go with the blackberry merlot chilled or the peach rose. I go there for bottles for dinner/parties all the time as well and they have chilled wine for buying, which is super convenient"}
