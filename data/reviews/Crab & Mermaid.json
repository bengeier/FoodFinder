{"text":"We tried this restaurant and we did a mistake. The service was slow not good, the waiters seem avoiding us and the menu is overpriced. Would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had dinner there on a crowed Friday, and the hostess rushed to get a table cleaned for us so we did not have to wait.  My wife and I had oysters, Lobster and Cioppino, while our kids had salmon and calamari.  The seafood tasted delicious, and not overdone with spices, like in some other restaurants.  The staff was very courteous and prompt, even when they had to deal with a new record of my kids, when they spilled three glasses.  So glad we bumped into this restaurant by accident, and I will go back for sure if I am in his area again."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my wife and it was a great experience. Our bar tender/server's name was Rich and he was very attentive. Customer service on the whole was very good. The environment is top notch, esp. for a seafood place in scottsdale. We've lived in and by lots of beach cities in LA, San Diego and Florida and so we've gotten to experience a wide range of seafood restaurants. And this one really had the feel of a beachy place with an open patio in old town, you could almost imagine it being in Santa Monica. We loved the environment. The food was all really good. Oysters and lobster, which we had, we all really fresh. The sides were quite tasty. We'll definitely make this a regular spot. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a beachy seafood kind of place away from the beach."}
{"text":"Not a huge menu and the food was pretty good. The service was kind of slow even when it wasn't super busy. The value for what you pay isn't great."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at! The Mahi-Mahi was dried out, the Caesar Salad had nothing in it. As far as fish restaurants go, the food was inedible. Went for dinner and left terribly disappointed. My wife ordered the Tuna Carpaccio over a Salad Nicoise. Hardly - no egg in the salad and very off tasting tuna. Even the presentation was very uninviting. I do not recommend you even try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"As far as seafood in the desert goes, this place is great, however, having spent many years on the east coast, I've had a taste for amazing seafood, so I'm a little judgementy when it comes to all yummy morsels from the sea.   I had heard great things about this place since it had opened, so when trying to decide where to get lunch on a Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try finally. We rode our bikes over (with my dogs) and the entire staff was very accommodating from the moment we arrived. They showed us where we could put our bikes and invited us to sit at the perfect table on the patio with the dogs (BONUS! DOG FRIENDLY PATIO!). Our server was very friendly and service was prompt.   We ordered the oysters, the Inner Harbor Crab Cakes, and the Fish n' Chips to share. The oysters were delicious and made me very excited for the rest of the meal to come. The crab cakes were advertised as Maryland Style, and all though the flavor wasn't bad, they were disappointing. Maryland crab cakes should have lump crab meat in them, these were shredded. Also, they lacked that nice dear or the outside that gives them a nice crunch. These were almost mushy throughout. The fish n' chips were tasty, all though the fish was a little greasy, like they had been fried at a low temperature.   As far as I've found in the valley so far, this place is great to get my seafood fix, I'll be interested to explore their menu further, especially after the oysters. If you're from Maryland though, and are looking for a great crab cake like I've been since moving here, this is not the place to get it unfortunately."}
{"text":"We have heard some positive reviews for this place, but could never find the time to get down there and try it.  Finally, we walked in and sat down at the bar with plenty of open spots to choose from.  Reviewing the menu before hand we knew that the North Beach Cioppino and the Lobster Roll was #1 on our minds.  In one area they had an oyster bar that are all hand shucked, with 3 or 4 different varieties to choose from.  The bartenders knew how to explain the flavor of each and where they came from.  As seafood fans we had to order a few because they were on happy hour and had never tried the type of oyster they had.  When the food came we didn't waste much time in digging in.  The NB Cioppino was a lot of food and came in a large cast iron bowl.  Tons of different fish, clams, mussels all into one big pot of goodness.  The lobster roll was also very delicious and full of flavor.  The staff was friendly and took care of us very well.  We will most certainly be back to try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"A great new seafood spot to old town Scottsdale! First class food and service! The raw bar has everything, from several different oysters to giant shrimp! The drinks are out if this world good! Grab a seat at the bar and drink up! The open air dining room is sleek and is great for people watching."}
{"text":"Food was greasy, portions very small for the money. Service was lacking, the waitress kept taking plates away before we were finished. It felt like she was trying to get us out the door. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Crab & Mermaid was very good.  We ordered the lobster roll and the Gumbo.  The lobster was just enough.  The bread had a good flavor.  The gumbo had a flavorful sauce.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The atmosphere is inviting.  I was greeted warmly and our service was great.  Stephanie was very attentive.  We did not wait to be seated and our food came out quickly.  Stephanie made sure that all our needs were met.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The spicy and hot lobster roll is phenomenal! The beers were cold and tasty and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it! We were excited when we noticed this place going up - its in a great location and from the street, the patio/bar area looked awesome. Went in for dinner, seated right away, outside. Service was slow, we ordered oysters but she forget to bring the hot sauce we asked for. No biggie. Ordered our food, but then the sauce that was suppose to come with my dish was missing. Again, not a huge deal to just ask for some - but we weren't checked on again for over 10 minutes. So I just ate my meal without it, which was a bummer cause my fish and rice were kind of bland. We skipped out on dessert, which we probably would of tried - but we didn't want to hang around for another 30 minutes. All in all, it's worth a try if you're in the area - and we probably will again (ill update review if we do), but we weren't as wow-ed as we had hoped!"}
{"text":"It had been a long anticipated wait to try old town's newest restaurant and after my experience tonight I could have continued waiting. The friendliest encounter at this establishment was not by the brand new staff but by the guests sitting beside us. Had we known that guests were no longer welcome once the clock started to count down to the minutes to the final hour (which by then we had already placed our entire order) we would have not let our lobster die in vain for terrible service.  I understand it is extremely rude to show up minutes before closing but I did not realize it was also rude to show up close to an hour and half before closing time, at least that is how our server had treated us. Then again everything we asked for was an inconvenience including when our entree arrived incomplete and were simply asked  for the remaining items that had been missing from the menu listing.  Unless other restaurants go above and beyond we are typically warned that the kitchen is closing and are asked if there is anything else we would like to order before the kitchen shuts down. We had loved the food so much we had asked to place a to go order while still eating and were told the kitchen was done for the night 30 minutes before the establishment closed. Clearly dessert was out of the question.  My girlfriend and I save up for a nice dinner every so often and were appalled that for the price we paid we were treated as if we were two teenagers splitting a bowl of soup and a glass of water without knowledge of tipping. If the food had not been so amazing there would be no star to give, and this is from two people who earn their money working in the restaurant industry.   With all the other options on just that street alone they certainly aren't a priority. I hope they don't treat all their guests this way because they will certainly have no business, especially as off season approaches."}
{"text":"Lobster roll was a bit pricey but delicious. On a nice night sitting outside watching people walk around Old Town is fun. Biggest issue we had was one of the local golf cart drivers parked right in front to wait for a fare and smoke his super smelly cigar. Not the restaurant's fault but certainly something that put a damper on the evening."}
{"text":"Food was awful!! Don't get the crab cakes they are so wet and saggy!!! The sauce under the crab cake is so bad no flavor at all! Popcorn shrimp are the frozen ones and lime cilantro rice it comes from a box.  Buck n' rider is a much better place for seafood! Fish tacos were super greasy and no flavor"}
{"text":"Hi we have been regulars since it has opened, We avoided it during the snowbird season and returned last week. We found the menu to be much different, the pick three options were gone and my wife's favorite salmon tacos were gone. We enjoyed our meal but were disappointed some of our favorites were gone. Bob"}
{"text":"I am beyond impressed with this restaurant.  We were here Thursday during the evening and our server, Hannah, gave us great recommendations. The lobster roll (cold and plain) and the jumbo lump crab cocktail were perfect with the Coronado Mermaid Red Ale. I will be back for more great food and impeccable service."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever had. The lobster bisque was gritty, cold and had no taste. The oysters did not look like oysters, and sure enough, my boyfriend got food poisoning later that night. I chose not to eat them since they looked funky and I did not get sick. I think it was our waitress' first job as she had no idea what she was doing and she was incredibly awkward. This place had potential and I was looking forward to trying it, but unfortunately was not impressed, it was a waste of money and a date night."}
{"text":"Their food was good and average but overpriced. The place vibes were nice and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying service was 5 stars. The lower grade is for the food.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche and the poki Ahi appetizers.  I didn't see much shrimp in the ceviche, the poki was OK.  We then ordered a fish and chips and crab cakes.  The fish and chips was good.  The crab cakes are nothing to talk about.  I had better frozen crab cakes.  We also had a giant desert....last good, but got sick right after... over all, not a very good experience."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant and reviewed the menu. I liked what was listed.  Especially the lobster bisque. I then read the previous reviews and made the decision to try it out for myself.  I shared this review of the restaurant with a friend at work who told me the place was horrible when they went to the grand opening.  I get that. Still trying to work out the bugs.  Another coworker saw the Web site on my monitor and said he recently ate there and it was great.  I really had to try it now.   Went on a Wednesday and early for a dinner out. The service was great by Courtney. Pleasant and most attentive. I ordered the lobster bisque and I thought it was more tomato than cream - like a Manhattan Clam Chowder. I also had the crab and spinach dip which was a large amount.  I really enjoyed the main entrée of Crab Louie.  Very cool and summery.  Over all a nice atmosphere and a pleasant experience.  Hard to find in Scottsdale sometimes  without spending big bucks.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time this weekend. The decor and atmosphere are very nice and trendy.   The staff are all very polite and the service was excellent.  Now the only negative thing in my opinionare the prices... It feels like a lunch atmosphere and the food is plated as such, but it's definitely dinner prices. In my opinion everything priced about 15% too high.   I wouldn't come here again just because it doesn't feel like the kind of place to $50 for dinner (that's no drinks, and no appetizers... Just two entrees) for essentially lunch food with a trendy vibe. I would maybe recommend to a tourist since it's conveniently located in Old Town."}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place after sampling their food at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. We had the bowl of Lobster Bisque along with the bowl of Muscles in the White Wine sauce. The food was delivered with generous portions, although the Lobster Bisque was lukewarm at best. The service was very slow in that the we rarely saw our waitress and took quite awhile before she came over to take our order. At the end, after delivering the bill, we never saw our waitress ever return. Glad that we had cash to pay our bill with!"}
{"text":"Total 2-Stars for the crabby artichoke dip, it has no flavor. Decent portion, and chips are good, but again no flavor.  But 4-Stars for blackened swordfish sandwhich. Very. very good, and a great portion size."}
{"text":"The menu offers \"East Coast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast\" dishes.  Don't be misled into believing that is where the seafood actually comes from. The shrimp for the \"Gulf Coast  Bayou\" dish were sourced from the Philippines, our waitress informed us after we asked. OMG!  We did not order them. Four of us had dinner; we shared a crab cake appetizer, I had Fish Tacos (It was Cinco de Mayo), the other 3 each ordered one of the fish dishes, each also upgrading to the \"Chowda\" for a side. Crabs cakes - No lump crab, mainly filler, soggy.  Dominant flavor was cracker. Fish Tacos also disappointing.  Each taco had 2 fish nuggets; small, heavily battered, and greasy. The restaurant has an interesting concept for the fish entrees; pick a fish, then pick a spice/sauce, then pick a cooking method.  All 3 of my companions picked the Mahi for the fish then each picked a different spice and a different cooking method (Grilled, Sautéed, Blackened).  They all looked and tasted about the same, which is to say bland.  Universal verdict - \"It was OK but on the dry side and lacked any real flavor\". Finally the \"New England Clam Chowda\".  Potato chowder would be more accurate.  All 3 commented it was too thick and pasty.  3 thumbs down.  BTW, 2 of the 3 are former New Englanders. Service, on the other hand, was very good.  Our waitress was efficient and friendly.  She was able to answer our questions and if she did not know the answer she went and got an answer.  Score the service as A+. The décor is exactly the kind of hokey nautical you'd expect in the middle of a desert, neither offending nor appealing. The seating is bewildering.  Our table for 4 had padded seats on the wall side and 2 hard metal patio chairs on the other side.  No padding and quite uncomfortable during the course of a long dinner. Bottom line - this place has too many shortcomings to even be on the \"we ought to try it again sometimes\" list."}
{"text":"Lobster roll was great! Service was excellent. Ambiance is also great having a bright location with big windows not like your typical seafood shacks with dark and gloomy designs. It's also great to know that they have a raw bar."}
{"text":"Very good new seafood restaurant in Scottsdale. Tried for first time tonight. It only opened in March. Will go back for sure. Great food & service. Best dining experience in a while."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is great! Seafood is fresh and tasty.. price I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't super expensive. Only negatives, uncomfortable seats and small patio."}
{"text":"The service is the best part about this place. The atmosphere is also relaxed and open with a beautiful patio. Unfortunately at the end of the day it comes down to the food and sadly we were not impressed.   Bacon wrapped shrimp- Way overcooked. Our least favorite of the night. Shrimp was like rubber and all the fat had been cooked off of the bacon leaving it with no taste  Lobster Mac and Cheese- This dish was ok. It was Mac and cheese with lobster in it somewhere. I could taste it but couldn't see any pieces.  Lobster Roll- my first Lobster Roll and maybe my last. The bread was dry but the lobster was good. Not great, but good. I stopped eating the roll halfway through and just ate the remaining Lobster pieces.   Over all the food lacked seasoning in every dish. I think a bit more salt and a few other seasonings could have taken our meal to another level and even earned a fourth star."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!  Service was wonderful our server Carly was fun and very on top of things! The food was very High quality everything we had ordered was Outstanding and flavorful! The environment was super chill, the music was great it is a great place to go if you are looking for a quality and non \"yuppy\" place to go. Very good vibes"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere frendly staff.  We got the clam chowder and half dozen fat boy oysters to start. I didn't  get the shrimp cocktail but i wish i did. For dinner i ordered the calamari and my wife the lobster roll. Both were excellent  We will be back.."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and you all tried to help me but, I went anyway. The restaurant is super cute inside and the service was good unfortunately, I came for the food. The only items that I can recommend are the clam chowder which was not great and the ranch dressing. I suggest you avoid the crab cakes. My friends water had a chemical taste and I overheard the table next to us complaining about a hair in there banana foster right before ours came out. So sad, I had high hopes."}
{"text":"So first time here. To begin Food/drinks were great! Started with a half dozen oysters, got 3 different types all so delicious!! Then went on to order dinner I had the steam pot. 1.5 lb lobster, clams, mussels, corn, sausage and potatoes= OUTSTANDING!! My guy had clam chowder and shrimp boil both really enjoyed our meals!! The one thing keeping me from 5 stars was the service. Our server was completely disinterested and just over all lack luster attitude about her job. (I'm sure management will catch on quick!) However, We will return because the food was fantastic! Defiantly would recommend this new Scottsdale gem!"}
{"text":"As a Seattle native I was super nervous to try this place since I'm used to VERY fresh fish. However... I was not disappointed here! Had the fish and chips and they were fantastic! You definitely get your dollars worth here, reasonably and the servings are great. (Reminds me of a place in San Diego called PB fish shop). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to walk here from the parking garage next to SMOCA after walking through the museum's rather bland exhibits, and it wasn't too bad a stroll.  There were plenty of people, but I wasn't jostled or anything.  Having just snarfed down a scone at the Australian Bakery, I ordered the clam chowder in the bread bowl ($12).  The serving size was enormous, and I liked the little touches like the toasted bread top and bacon crumbles.  It even came with oyster crackers!  The clam chowder was exceptionally rich, creamy, and chock full of clams and potatoes, with a bit of celery as well.  It easily is one of the best bowls of clam chowder I've ever had.  A sprinkle of black pepper and ripping off the bread to dip it into the soup made it fantastic.  My water and order arrived very fast, and the waitress checked back several times.  The $5 off coupons for the various Square One concepts were nice too, including one for C&M itself I received for filling out the satisfaction survey that came with the bill.  While it's not as convenient for me as Buck & Rider, it's definitely a great place I'd like to explore more.  It's a little more casual than B&R, and a tad less upscale, which isn't a bad thing.  Only minor bit of grousing: The stools/chairs for the hightop tables are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Tried this place out thanks to Arizona Restaurant Week and let me tell you would so come back. The shrimp ceviche and the New England Clam Chowda in a bread bowl were awesome for the first course. Then we each had the Crab Cake Platter and it was Maryland Crab, totally yummy. The Rice Crispie Treat drizzles in caramel was not your typical rice Crispie treat and the Banana Foster was amazing. Definitely have to try outside of restaurant week as was good for a restaurant only been open for two months."}
{"text":"Being from New England and a seafood lover, I had to try this place.  I'm glad we found it.  I ordered the lobster roll (cold, traditional) and it was delicious.  I was dressed in a lemon aioli instead of the traditional mayo, but that only added a light lemon flavor and didn't distract from the lobster at all. And it was served on the New England style hot dog roll.  The owner must be a New Englander!  Hubby had the fish and chips, which he devoured!  I tried a bite and they were delicious.  The cole slaw was good too, but I have to warn you, it is garlicky!  Overall, a good meal for this New England transplant.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. I just returned from a trip to San Diego and the seafood here is just as good, if not better than what we had right by the ocean!  I got the shrimp tacos with their house spice rub, blackened, and a side of chips. It was cooked perfectly and tasted INCREDIBLE! My husband and family got the scallop tacos, oysters, king crab ceviche, lobster rolls, and everyone was very impressed with their food. They also have a unique beer selection which was a great way to try some new brews. I'll be coming back for another seafood fix soon!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the clam \"chowda\" if you have ever had good clam chowder before. A big lump of goo with pieces of potato large enough to have sunk the Titanic. If there was any clam in there I couldn't find it. My wife liked the mahi mahi and we had some oysters that were fine and I had the po'boy with shrimp that was mostly bread. It was like the chef had never seen real chowder or po'boy so maybe he needs to spend some time on the gulf coast. This place needs some work. Nice place Good service"}
{"text":"The food was not great. The chowder was good but the potatoes are cut way to big. There was mostly all potatoes in the soup and not that much soup. The gumbo was flavorful but again the sausage was cut so big you could not easily eat it. The fish tacos ( we got them grilled) were not tasty at all. Even the bloody Mary's left a lot to be desired. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed it but one thing really soured this place for us. We started with some oysters from the raw bar and two of their specialty blueberry margaritas which were equally fantastic. I ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi with asparagus and rice. After a bit of a wait we received our food which was delicious until the third bite in when I found a short black hair cooked into the fish. It takes a lot to disgust me but this did it. Our waitress took it back and while they were reasonably speedy replacing it they offered nothing more than a quiet \"sorry\" for the bad experience. I expected at minimum maybe an offer to comp my drink would have been offered. Unfortunately, I doubt we will return after that experience."}
{"text":"Great food reasonable priced nice drink menu.. Server Olivia was great... nice mid range spot in Scottsdale for some laid back seafood... Definitely will be back.  Shrimp sandwhich was great!"}
{"text":"Our server was so sweet! She was prompt and just happy in general! They have a great poke bowl lunch that you should definitely try. Also, their clam chowder is better than the clam chowder I have had back home in New England!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, lackluster atmosphere. Not a good sign when the lobster roll is flavorless. There are restaurants within walking distance from Crab & Mermaid that do the same food, only much better."}
{"text":"Finally good seafood has returned to the valley.  Been there twice and and both times the food has been a knockout.  The off the dock menu I had a grilled halibut with the house blend spice rub.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, flaky and moist.  I need to find out how to get a jar of that spice rub.  Super tasty.  On the side I recommend the lobster bisque (very generous chunks of the lobster in the soup) and the grilled asparagus.  From the appetizer I highly recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp and the lobster mac and cheese (once again, overly generous with huge pieces of lobster).  Warning: the rice crispy treat from the dessert menu is highly addictive."}
{"text":"First time being here, I came here for their Restaurant week special. I got the ceviche, steamed lobster, and banana foster.   Lobster was so good !! I would def comeback. I want to try their lobster rolls.   The ceviche was decent, and banana foster custard was good. Giving them 4/5 stars because I've had better ceviche, I didn't think it was authentic.   Decor was really cute. My best friend and I couldn't help but take pictures during our visit.   Service was great. I think the manager over heard us talking about the chips and he brought us out a fresh batch. Food came out on a timely manner. Looking forward to a future visit!"}
{"text":"Lucky to get two stars because there's not another seafood restaurant close. Happy hour oysters are $2. Small, like an inch long (I asked for the largest), and the shucker must have really gotten into shucking them cause they looked already eaten when they got to me. Not bad taste but ya gotta be more careful with that shucker or they end up looking macerated. Lobster roll is $22. Total six inches long. Not a bad flavor but bland, and if you've ever been anywhere a real one is sold you will be disappointed. Lobster flavor buried by the butter on the toasted bread. Lobster rolls come from the northeast where fishermen work hard and eat a lot so they should big big, tasty, and cheaper. If it's your first, then pay a lot and try it. It's fair, just way overpriced for the size. And the sandwiches come with chips? Uh, seafood says cole slaw maybe? Beer is cold and happy hour is fair. Good selections there albeit a little on the stingy side for quantity. Got a to go order so I could sample another item just to be fair. Got the oyster po'boy. Cost $15. Oyster flavor was covered by breading and bun. Quantity and quality versus price is astonishing for the area. Service was okay. Server acted like I was infringing on her time but food and drink came out efficiently. Old Scottsdale is considered touristy. Attitude and friendliness are paramount to staying open. So take an uber and go somewhere you can feel you're getting taste, value, and courtesy for your patronage, then just walk around this area for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Crab and Mermaid for happy hour and I was impressed with the quality of food and drinks for the GREAT prices. They even had a selection of premium spirits on happy hour for \"well\" prices!  They also have a full oyster bar that is fully stacked fresh every day.  It is another fine example of the great foodie/restaurant movement going on in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a lonely time at the new Crab & Mermaid. Our Caramelized Shrimp Starter was excellent. Mother's Day was wonderful sitting outside, our waitress was excellent. Our Main Course was also yummy. On the Fish & Chip  - East Coast little to much batter on the cod. My daughter had the Shrimp Po'Boy yummy.  Wonderful place and we both wish you all the best in your Scottsdale, AZ location. We will be back in with the rest of our family real soon!!"}
{"text":"We shared the Fried Calamari, Crab Cakes, and Lobster Roll. Calamari can sometimes be like chewing a shoe. This was very good. Some crispy, none of it like eating a shoe. The crab cake was not lump crab meat, but minced crab, but there was a lot of it. Tasty. I would order both appetizers again. The Lobster Roll was flat out GREAT. Lots of Lobster.Optional saracha sauce.  Also worth noting, a great place to people watch. Lots of SF Giants fans walking back from the game. Right in old town. Free parking nearby. We're going back. I will definitely get the Lobster Roll again on our next visit. And it's near Super Chunk, my favorite cookie place."}
{"text":"Oysters were way too fishy so I sent them back. I ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi...it was just eh..the sauce is the only thing that made it edible . The spinach was amazing though so I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious and features a great variety of seafood. I love how they offer east cost, gulf coast, and west coast seafood options. The kids menu features great options for young ones seafood and land fairing alike. We had the lobster Mac and cheese- not the best in the valley but pretty damn good! We ordered the New England Steam Pot in the east coast section- a yummy clam bake- all that is missing is the  sand from the Cape. I also recommend the Po' Boy with shrimp- the bread on this is moist and not at all hard and crusty like most Po' Boys you really get to enjoy the seasoning and shrimp with this sandwich. It's delish!!  Nov 2016 Update  The menu changed a great deal. No more east coast/west coast not more New England clambake- no more lobster Mac and cheese and no more lobster bisque. So after getting over the losses we were able to find still some amazing dishes. The New England lobster roll is excellent- i was happy for the choice between cold or hot given everyone from NE has a different preference. The lobster is fresh and plentiful and with the treasure of large lumps amidst the roll. We also tried the \"shrimp cargot\" the shrimp is drenched in melted in Havarti cheese- incredibly yummy and fattening- but worth it. My daughter got the fish n chips subbing for shrimp they were huge and delicious.The mahi mahi grilled with veggies was cooked perfectly. So despite the changes it is still outstanding- just need the New England clambake to come back!"}
{"text":"Great seafood spot will definitely visit again.  Great bubbly service from Brittany! Had wanted to truly try everything but selected the crab & spinach dip along with the crab cakes.  Very delicious. Followed by grilled Mahdi mani with house seasoning (amazing) blackened & served with lobster bisque & grilled asparagus.  So much food but oh sooooo good! Wanted to try the key lime pie but couldn't even finish my food!  Can't wait to go back!  The menu has an amazing concept in building your own dish.  I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 for one simple reason Our food & plates were left to sit in front of us the entire time we lingered & chatted.  We paid our tab & left dishes still on the table.  Overall great experience."}
{"text":"My husband is a serious seafood lover.  After he read the review in July 2016 issue of Phoenix Magazine, we had to come and check it out.  We shared the bacon wrapped shrimp.  He had the lobster roll.  I had fish & chips.  The food was delicious.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Everything was underseasoned. None of the items we had were remarkable except for the pinot grigio I had. We had the crab and spinach artichoke dip that needed salt and acid, the tortilla chips were thick and not pleasing with such a rich dip. The crab cakes had no texture and also had poor seasoning. We ordered the Halibut sautéed with the orzo and the ceaser. The ceaser dressing was too garlicky and not enough acid, the salad was over dressed. The orzo was cooked well but not seasoned well either. The Halibut was slightly overcooked making it dry. It isn't what I was hoping for with another attempt at seafood on Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"I had to return to AZ--not by choice--but visiting this restaurant was a happy surprise, and I only wish it had existed when I lived there.  The cioppino was among the best I've had in quality, variety of seafood and preparation, and that's not easy in a landlocked desert with no wholesale food markets nearby.  The intrepid owner deserves the best of luck."}
{"text":"Love the food ! Can not wait to try more items .  It does take a very long time to get your food . That's why one star dropped . There was only a few people in - so kitchen needs to step it up ASAP .   The patio is perfect on a windy afternoon!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here! Ordered oysters and shrimp ceviche both very fresh and tasty. Drink selection was good as well. We left happy! Fairly pricey but worth it for fresh seafood in the desert. I'll be back! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Decent and quick food. Lobster roll taste ok. Had it warm and they don't put enough meat for the price. Service was spot on tho. I might give it another try. The wife digs it. But she eats the plain salad crap."}
{"text":"Disappointed to go to an indie restaurant and find it was more like a national chain. Seafood is fresh but uninspiring. It was a sin to have totally soggy fries with the Fish and Chips...........any local pub serves better. Lobster in the lobster roll was okay but there was no other ingredients, like chopped celery, in the somewhat thin sauce. And please lower the music somewhat.......it is noisy enough without it drowning out any conversation. I understand the restaurant has only been open a week or so and hope it can do better."}
{"text":"Second visit. The last time it was ok, not great, but just ok. So we're craving a lobster roll, they have one on the proper split top bun, pan toasted. OK, looks like it will be good since it has all the right stuff. $22 not bad either, considering you pay $50 for one on the Maine Lobster Food Truck.  Here's the problem: LOBSTER ROLLS DO NOT HAVE SPICY STUFF IN THEM. We couldn't even taste the lobster. The server went and checked, yep, these were the \"plain\" ones but it seems that the plain ones have some spices too.  She told the manager, but he never came over. Walked by a couple of times. I guess they don't care.  Lobster Roll recipe: Lobstah Mayo a touch of salt and pepper Maybe a tiny bit of celery Pan toasted split top hot dog bun.  NOTHING else.  Still hoping for a seafood restaurant to open that was as good as Fosters was before it went to crap."}
{"text":"Had the lobster Mac and cheese, bacon wrapped shrimp, and fish n chips (college game day).  All were phenomenal..  Great atmosphere, perfect location, great separation from the competition with seafood in Scottsdale!!! I recommend this place for both day and evening drinkers looking for a departure from the typical Scottsdale bar food of wings and/or tacos...   Well done."}
{"text":"It's ok.. seems like everything is a bit greasy.  We had the crabby artichoke dip and sure you expect a little fat, but the chips were home made and very shiny with grease.  If you feel like fish though, their price is pretty reasonable if you pick a type, seasoning, way of cooking, and a couple sides."}
{"text":"Walked to Crab & Mermaid from my hotel and was pleasantly surprised. Sat at the bar early evening and enjoyed watching the tables and bar fill up. I ordered a glass of Malbec and had the North Beach Cioppino for dinner (see pic). Lots of shellfish, great broth and dipping bread served in an oversized cast Iron skillet. (I would have preferred it served in a sourdough bread bowl especially considering the amount of delicious broth). Service was friendly and attentive; food was great; Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Should be called Crab and Mediocre. Crab dip was pretty flavorless and the $20 lobster roll was very small. Overall, not impressed for old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A friend suggested coming here for restaurant week and I'm happy that I didn't let some of these \"yelpers\" scare me off. My mahi-mahi caesar salad was AMAZING. I'm from the east coast, so I know flavorful fish...the mahi mahi didn't disappoint. Our shrimp ceviche appetizer could have had a bit more kick to it but it was good and nice portion for two people. The bananas foster dessert was delicious! Overall, service was pleasant and prompt!"}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere. Super friendly staff. We had Shrimp Ceviche. It was a bit plain...fresh but plain. Also had the crab salad. Same thing. Fresh, but not a lot of flavor. Will definitely go back and try the other options on the menu, too."}
{"text":"Ok- I've got to update my rating to a 5 star! I keep coming back for fresh fish & Im never disappointed. The scallops are amazing & the Salmon is one of the best I've had.!! -                                                  (this was my 1st review) -   Was skeptical- Fish in the desert... But I must say I'm impressed! Very fresh fish & good recipes. A must try! Cute decor!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out and it certainly didn't disappoint!  We stopped in one night early for dinner and I enjoyed the salmon with house rub, orzo pasta and roasted asparagus - so ridiculously good!  I could seriously enjoy this meal several times a week with no complaints.  Nice atmosphere, great service and super tasty food!"}
{"text":"First time here - everything described on the menu looked delicious - so we decided to embibe on the Oysters Rockefeller.  What was served was NOT what was described on the menu - in fact I thought they had forgotten to finish the dish - including baking the oysters.  When the manager asked us how things were we explained this was not what we had expected,  To our disappointment we were THEN informed (as opposed to being told at the time of ordering) that  the menu was still being tweaked - and she verified that what we were served was a work in progress.  One would expect the information in advance of the order and to be compensated in some way when a $19 dollar food item is inedible....such was not the case.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"I am a seafood fanatic so I was excited when this place opened!!! They offer a variety of seafood from coast to coast to fit everyone's fancy.  We went during happy hour and the happy hour wasn't anything extravagant. My drink was delicious though! We were seated outside next to some kind of water pump. The waitress was friendly and service was fantastic.  The parking can be an issue since there is only about 4 parking spots on the side. If you are going here, go park in the parking garage behind it.  The food, was a bit disappointing to me. The coconut shrimp was okay but it didn't wow me. I decided to try the clam chowder since I used to dig up clams when I lived in Massachusetts. I would give the chowder a 5 out of 10. They put crispy bacon on top after the thought so it was hard and crunchy. It should be blended in to add to the taste, not take away from it. The potatoes were huge and not small enough, so I basically ate potato chowder with a side of clam. We decided to the get the large bake that included lobster, mussels and clams. What they forgot to tell us is that the lobster is DIY. I wasn't in the mood to break open my own lobster that day. The price for that was over $40 and I know we live in a desert but back home that would be $20 or less for the same thing. The bananas foster was amazing though!! I would stop in for dessert in the future but that's about it.  Overall, I wasn't super impressed. It's a nice addition but I think a few things could use a few changes."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just had the pleasure of Dining for lunch today 8/4/2016.  The service was great, we had the Crabby Spinach and Artichoke Dip, bacon wrapped shrimp with two sauces along with the Crab Cocktail and Basket of Cajun Peel and eat shrimp - all was awesome and fresh.  This establishment was clean and the people who work their are all very friendly.  I will definitely be going back and recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg!  Where have you been hiding! Being from the Chesapeake Bay area, Carolina and Gulf Coast.... we have died and gone to seafood heaven! Best Remoulade ever and living in New Orleans before here....that is saying a lot! Brought fiance here for lunch and found foodgasims!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in while driving pass, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  It was a Saturday night not long after they opened.  I LOVE seafood & got very excited.  Pros: *The wait staff seemed very pleasant *Great location & Atmosphere  Cons: *The cocktail was undrinkable to both my boyfriend & I *The food was just okay.  Not even okay in the sense, I really want to go back.  Neither my bf or I were impressed.  I left not feeling satisfied.  *Prices weren't cheap - would have been worth it for quality food.  To be honest, I don't think I want to return to try it again.  I know everyone and everything can have an off night, but this was a Sat night; a new place & it wasn't even busy.   Every new place is usually busy at the beginning."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time a few weeks ago. The service was great and the food came out fast. The cioppino was awesome and I would definitely get it again. My husband ordered the fish and chips and thought it was good, but not great."}
{"text":"Food here is less than mediocre. Ordered two shrimp appetizers, both came with 6 of the smallest  shrimp I've ever seen. The sauce served with the shrimp was obviously straight out of a bottle rather than being made fresh in the restaurant. Everyone in our dinner party disliked their main entree. Old town Scottsdale has too many good restaurants too waste your time and money here. I do want to give the restaurant praise for having nice servers and a great outdoor patio. But I feel the 1 star review is justified based on the poor food quality."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here because there's not a lot of restaurants that offer seafood in Arizona. I first ordered a drink and it was very sour it was their version of a margarita and I sent it back and then I had another drink instead, Tropical punch and it was too I hadn't Boyster shot and it was absolutely horrible  I needed to add Splenda. The appetizers and the oysters were  great ! service very slow and The lobster was extremely salty . The banana foster was good but I've never had it with pudding? which is kind of different. The worst part about it is it's called crab and mermaid and they don't have crab legs!!! That's like having a place called pizza and wings without pizza LOL"}
{"text":"At the time of this review this is a newly opened seafood restaurant with a bar and patio. Here they have a mixologist not a bartender so you might want cocktails here. The dining room is very nautical and when your inside it looks just like your at the shore.  It was hard to decide on what to order because I was interested on several dishes. It was easy to rule out the Halibut Sandwich because that would have been a $24. sandwich that came with one side.  I had the CA Tuna Melt. It was one slice of bread with Confit Tuna and lots of unripe very thick tomatoes, some other things and served with chips. The Tuna was cooked nicely it was very soft and tender. The sandwich was creamier than I expected it to be. Not sure if the chips were made in house or if they came from a bag. It was OK but it seemed like something was missing. Maybe it needed a squeeze of lemon and a fresh herb?   My husband had the C&M Gumbo. Some of his clams were broken and some seafood wasn't cooked all the way and to eat it he had to pull the shellfish open with his hands. The sausage on his plate was also over cooked and very dry.  We did inform the manager about the Gumbo and he said that they haven't been open long and they are still working things out.  2.5 stars  Guess I rounded them up a star because they are new.  Small parking lots but a large public lot is behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was sad to hear that this restaurant had closed before I got around to writing a review, but I'm going to write one anyway.  We were walking around Scottsdale, popping in here and there at different establishments,  when our friend lead us here. We sat just outside the restaurant so that we could people watch as we ate. We ordered shrimp tacos and the hot lobster roll. I had the Arctic Sea Dragon for a cocktail while the guys had beers.   Everything was fantastic! The hot lobster, while on the pricey side, was perfect. The sweetness of the lobster meat was not covered up one bit by the sauce that it was marinated in. The shrimp tacos, while heavily battered, still tasted fresh. My drink was the perfect blend of cold and boozy. The place got busier the longer we sat there, but the atmosphere remained the same....relaxing and comfortable. At one point, one of the workers started turning the patio warmers on (thankfully), and at no point were we ever made to feel that we needed to leave because we had finished eating.  I don't know the reasoning for the closing of this restaurant, but I hope that one day, someone resurrects it, because I would definitely come back.  17/2017"}
{"text":"I am starting not to trust Yelp reviews. I came here despite the 3 1/2 stars and I am glad I did. Service was attentive, food was good, not great but I didn't expect gourmet. It was fresh, flavorful, well crafted and enjoyable.   Cocktails- I had the Elyx'n Vixen which was light and refreshing and not too sweet. I also had a Riptide Margarita because I couldn't not get the beautiful drink pictured on their website! It too was tart tangy fresh and delicious. My husband had the bloody Mary which he enjoyed so much he had two.   Food! I got the lobster roll cold, which was exactly what I was hoping it would be. Was delicious and fresh with big chunks of lobster! My husband got the gumbo, which he enjoyed very much. It came with a couple of deep fried okra which was a nice touch. My son enjoyed the fried oyster Po boy which came on a nice crusty bread with fresh tomatoes, lettuce and really good potato chips, fried in-house.   My one complaint would be the stools that you sit on for the hightop tables. They don't have a back, they're not very big, not extremely comfortable and for women there's nowhere to put your purse. They should provide little hooks on the table so you can hang your bag there.   All in all we enjoyed our meal and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Nice for a change.  Chill fish place in Old Town.  Loved it.  Cool nautical atmosphere, good selection of drinks, and great food!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Crab & Mermaid because I love seafood and their menu had a great selection from everywhere (east, gulf, and west coasts). However the food was mediocre - especially for the price!! Both my husband and I woke up with horrible stomach issues this morning (we shared our plates) and for the price the food was not that impressive. The atmosphere is awesome though - we had a great seat on the patio, and the oyster shooters were delicious (our waitress had them make us one with hot sauce/Bloody Mary mix - delicious). Overall, can't say I'd be back unless there were smoking happy hour deals - just way too overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and most of it deserves 2 stars. Place is a quarter full and I waited about 20 minutes for the mako shark plate. During my wait, I drank my water, and couldn't get more. When the plate came, it was missing the fries (\"not done yet\"). Fries came about 5 minutes later. Food, yep, 2 stars. The mako was the special, cubes of ok fish for $18 in their house rub, which I give 2 stars. I think I'll wait to return to this location when it's a new restaurant."}
{"text":"''Twas the day before Christmas Eve and my group of girls decided to do Pickleback shots and eat before delving into last minute Christmas shopping. Doubly crazy doesn't even describe our decisions that morning to do so but one thing is for sure, the Crab and Mermaid was great to us!  The Mussels served with bread had a lovely broth that shared a nice rosemary flavor but not too overpowering.   Crab Club - toasted bread layered with large lumps of crab meat, bacon and avocado. I ordered this with a salad and it was great  Po-boy - beer battered and tasty. It was alongside a hearty serving of salty fresh chips  Poke burrito- my friend was adventurous and created her own burrito. There's a little order form where you could mark what you wanted in your burrito. Poke was a new addition to the menu so she went for it and wasn't disappointed.   It took awhile for us to decide, especially since not all of arrived on time at 11am but the staff was very patient and we still had amazing service!"}
{"text":"REALLY wanted to like this place. There were 3 of us, one guest needed to return to work, lunch stop. I give service 2 stars.  We waited a long time for a Prosecco and draft beer, arrived half way thru meal. I was told keg needed to be changed. Okay, bring other guest the wine, not.  When we finally got drinks, manager apologized and took them off bill.  We had the fish and chips, good fish, slaw blah and chips mushy.  The Crab Louie lacked much crab and low on flavor.  Waitress seemed to need more training, not very personable till end. Thing manager talked to her. When he asked how things went we told him.  Son had ahi poki bowl said \"okay\", he orders them often at other places. Food 2.5 stars. All that said, bottom line, well  over priced for quality and portions. We also had clam chowder, good but small portion.  With all of the great choices in the area we all agreed we wouldn't return. Sorry, hopefully owners will reconsider menu and prices.  Since that visit and review, I was contacted by the owner and sent a gift card to try business again.  I have not yet, but will. I greatly appreciate owners offer."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktail was plentiful plump and delicious - I did an oyster flight - plump, tender, juicy; decent wine list, NE clam chowder w/bacon was a good choice.  Can't wait to go back.  Just remember to drop a set up when you drop the food.  My pet peeve :)  The bucket was empty... not a big deal, almost perfect :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful oysters, crab claws, french fries, and slaw...yummities!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town for spring training. We had read in the paper that this restaurant recently opened and the chef had worked for Todd English. We are big fans of Todd English and especially love his lobster rolls so we made it a point to stop in.   We had planned to come in for happy hour. The restaurant advertises happy hour on their website from 3-6pm. After being seated we asked our server about happy hour and she told us that the restaurant currently does not have happy hour. It's is frustrating to come in for something that is advertised that is really not available.  We ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll. The chowder was thick and clumpy but at least topped with bacon. There was also a film above the soup which didn't make it look very appetizing. We barely touched it.  The lobster roll can be served either hot or cold with the option of spicy or regular. We opted for cold and regular. The portion of the lobster was very generous. The bun was nicely toasted. We really enjoyed the lobster roll.   I understand the restaurant is new. I took one star off for the soup and two for the false advertising. Our server was very nice. I uploaded pictures from our meal."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of seafood on the menu. Halibut was awesome. Lobster roll awesome. Clam chowder was spot on, just like in New England. I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"To the commenter:  Look a the receipt picture I uploaded with my review.  You very clearly do serve BBQ oysters, or did on that night.  You might want to check your own menu.  Okay but pricy.  We were in the mood for seafood and dropped by this joint near old town Scottsdale - their shlick is offering up various regional seafood dishes from across the USA... there's New Orleans Poboys, New England style chowders and lobster rolls...you get the picture.    We ordered said items mentioned above - both were quality representations of the originals and probably at the top range of seafood quality for Arizona (there's not much going on here).  Still, their bbq oysters kind of sucked and did I mention the price?  Would come back, but only if in a very specific mood."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful space on Scottsdale Rd.  Great easy breezy nautical theme.  Service was fast a friendly.  I sat at the bar and had a Knotty Pine pale ale and the Buffalo popcorn shrimp.  The Buffalo seasoning was so hot I couldn't tell if I was eating shrimp or chicken.  The rest of the menu looks great and I can't wait to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Great Service. Had a caesar salad and shared the cioppino-- both were excellent! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Change your oil! Nothing worse than expecting great fresh seafood only to be subjected to the smell of old oil. We just left and needed to shower because we smelled like fried food when we left."}
{"text":"Not a fan. First time visitor. Wanted to like it. Agree with other reviews that it was just mediocre. Tacos and chowder were good. Tuna melt, crab club not great. We were celebrating my daughters birthday and she loves crab legs. She was happy and for tonight that is all that really matters. However we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Visited this fairly new seafood restaurant for lunch last week. It was my first visit and sadly, it is likely to be my last. The food was good, not great, but good. The service was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was faux nautical. So, what was the problem? The problem was the pricing. The prices are those of a fine dining establishment such as Mastro's Ocean Club or Eddie V's. For what it is, the place is way overpriced. I had the rather dry lobster roll with some potato chips and a small side of slaw. No drink, no fries or anything else. My bill was $23 ($28 with tip.) Aside from one other table, we were the only people in the restaurant -- at prime lunch hour, high noon. No one else came in all the time we were there and when we left around 1:30 pm, the place was empty. Too expensive for the working folks and tourists alike perhaps? I would like to see this place succeed but unless it has prices that reflect what it is, a small casual seafood place, I am afraid it will not."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time today. Service was excellent, Alyssa was a great and everyone else helped out taking care of us. We order a bevy of appetizers, including lobster Mac and cheese, crabby spinach and artichoke dip, the cold seafood platter, buffalo popcorn shrimp, lobster bisque, and bacon wrapped shrimp. Oh and the rice crispy treats for dessert. YUM. We also had a couple glasses of sangria (both red and white - both are a bit tart). This is a delicious little spot. Probably a 4 star in that the food is tasty but not like ocean club seafood level, however I have it 5 stars for a couple reasons...The service was great, in old town it's very hit or miss and this place is a hit, they have a lovely patio, and someone clearly spent a whole lot of time on decor and the feel of this place. It's unique and definitely worth a visit. Plus, mermaids. Come on."}
{"text":"Tried this place at the Scottsdale culinary fest so we decided to hit the restaurant. I had the beer battered fish tacos and they were great!  A lot of food though.  My husband had a mani dish and thought it was just so so.  But he did enjoy the oysters.  We also had the crab, spinach and artichoke dip that was pretty good.  Good addition to old town and the best fish tacos I have had in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a new place in Scottsdale and ended up here for lunch. Sat on the patio and service was good but food was disappointing. We got crab cakes which were decent but not great. We also got two of their signature dishes, $22 lobster roll and fish & chips. The fish and chips looked good at first but the underside was soggy and the fish fell out of the breading once cut open - also the fries were undercooked. The lobster roll was underwhelming. The bread to lobster ratio was far from ideal. The manager did check in on us and that was certainly appreciated but at that point it didn't seem worth it  to cause a scene and send our food back.  The concept of this place is great and think that old town needs this kind of place but the staples on their menu need a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"I went for lunch here today and it was mediocre at best. I had the tuna melt which was not bad. The restaurant was fairly empty while the other restaurants on the block were jamming!!! That is usual not a good sign. We had to ask the waitress to refill our waters and she disappeared for a long time when we were ready for our check. My two friends shared the crab cakes which they both said were not good and had a very odd texture. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place out and me and my BF decided to go on a Friday night to eat dinner there. The staff were super friendly and the food was amazing. I love seafood and was dying to try everything. We had 12 oyster which everyone of them were yummy we wanted to try all of the different selections, I also loved the appi of tuna poke which was fresh tuna and was presented so well with wrapped cucumber. We also, decided to try the cocktails and I got their version of a mule which was extra impressive and my BF got a watermelon drink which I would highly recommend it was perfect for our hot weather because it tasted cooling and fresh. Our main dishes I decided to get the surf n' turf which included lobster and steak with asparagus and a creamy rice pilaf. My BF got a make your own with cod, salsa verde, grilled with a side of lemon rice and asparagus. Overall, it was extra delicious. I would come back here again to get my seafood cravings satisfied and would highly recommend anyone to try it out."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend. I love raw clams and oysters and they didn't disappoint. I also had the cioppino and my boyfriend got the fish and chips. Everything was awesome and Clarissa was a wonderful server. We will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Not disappointed! Tried the crabby spinach & artichoke dip, and it was delicious!! Chips they served with it were also great! We also got oysters which were super fresh & delicious. For dinner we had fish & chips and the calamari steak. Both were fresh, and very tasty. Our server was very sweet, friendly and attentive. I'd say the only negative I have is that it was a little pricey for the portion size you get. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited last night with my girlfriend. Cool atmosphere and both of us being from back east we were happy to find a good fish place that isn't some horrible chain. Service was great, can't remember our servers name but she was friendly and efficient. Clam chowder was very tasty and had a good amount of clams. I have to say for the price their seafood platter was great! Everything was fresh and I haven't had raw clams in years. Good job guys! Lobster roll was tasty as hell! We left very pleased. This place hit the mark. When you want a good fish selection and don't want to go to Mastro's and spend a fortune this is the place."}
{"text":"Our first visit. Will not be going back. Went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was nearly empty. We were expecting some really good food, but it was NOT good at all. We ordered the lobster roll, fish and chips and the halibut. The fries that came with the fish were  tasty and acceptable. Also really enjoyed the bananas foster dessert. Our server, Clarissa, was very nice and helpful. Answered all our menu questions and checked on us for refills etc. will not return to this place because of the mediocre and way overpriced food."}
{"text":"Sorry but this restaurant needs alot of work. I had the lobster roll and it was mealy, too much mayo, and very disappointing."}
{"text":"Hey! Great location and I appreciate the outdoor misters for sure! A plus for AZ's heat and it's only spring people! The ambience is costal and casual and I love the ceiling decor.  I am a fist timer not just at your restaurant but pretty new to Scottsdale area as a joint venture has me doing quite  well. I am staying at the Marriott across the way this trip and decided to venture out for some lunch. Spotted your eye-catching restaurant and decided Crabs & Mermaids sounds like an awesome place to grab some lunch. I came in with a smile was greeted with one and was offered to sit wherever I liked ... That was nice! Here's were things went south: Server walks up, \" What can I get you to drink?\"  Me: Hi, I'll have a water and an Alaskan Red Ale please.  Server turns and walks away to the bar.  Ok.  Server returns with drinks fast and asks, \" Do you know what you want to order?\"  Me: I'll have the lobster roll.. Server: hot or cold? Regular or spicy? Me: hot and spicy please  Server picks up menu and walks away.  No smile, no greeting, no thank you, nothing.  Such a shame because I was imagining how cool of a place to come back to and be able to get fresh seafood in a place so far from an ocean!  Vicki, you are so beautiful! smile more, be a little more friendly trust me it would help! People go out to spend money to eat because they enjoy service. That's what a restaurant provides not just food. With much respect this is just some constructive criticism, that's all.  As for the food: The lobster roll is one of the best I've ever had! So meaty and delicious! Perfect portion for the price. I also loved the kettle chips and coleslaw. Because my bread was a quitter bread ( sogged-out halfway through because there was so much juicy lobster it just quit ) I mixed my remaining lobster with the coleslaw and it was like an entirely different meal/salad. LOVED it!  I noticed there was a dessert section on the menu and saw a banana foster's something or other I totally would have tried because again, I was there to enjoy some lunch but instead my check was delivered without even asking if I wanted or needed anything else also my plate was removed. I was enjoying my chips with the half of beer I still had left! Bummer.  My water glass remained empty too but that's ok we are in a drought so whatever.  So, all in all l would say the food was better than most a 5 star for that amazing lobster roll but the experience with the service left me feeling like I've had better so a 3 star  \"A-Ok! I would give it another try\"  review for now."}
{"text":"Stopped in for something different.  Husband had the crab Louie salad.  It was VERY COLD!  We have never had such a delicious fresh cold salad.  Beautifully plated.  I had the lobster mac-n-cheese.  Lots of yummy lobster meat.  Creamy cheesy heaven served HOT.  Can't wait to try something else.  Will return"}
{"text":"I'm from la and was excited to find a place hat served a lobster roll in AZ. Over all it was pretty good. They also have a nice cocktail selection."}
{"text":"Use to like this place till they changed their menu and we kept getting sick after eating there.  Plz turn away if this is option for you."}
{"text":"So happy there is a new seafood spot in old town! I went there with a buddy in town and and had  a great experience at the bar. The cocktails were delicious! I had the Riptide Rita!  For appetizers, we loved the bacon wrapped shrimp and the tuna poke! Next, we shared fish and chips, which came with a flavorful tarter sauce and fries. The restaurant is beautiful! I can't wait to bring more friends and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a little bit today for a small appetizer, but the Oysters were AWESOME! The bartender was super friendly and we had a great time chatting with him. We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Place seems cool. Nice lunch crowd. Staff is friendly.  They don't have non-battered fish tacos?! It's 2016.  What fish joint doesn't have non-battered fish tacos?! I asked the my server and she asked the chef, then told me they didn't have it.   So, I ordered the $12 Clam Chowder, instead. While it was alright (I love Clam Chowder), it did not deliver on the sticker price. For $1.99, Campbell's Soup has at least two of the Crab & Mermaid's serving size in one can. However, the loaf of break it was served in was huge, but not likely worth $12.   Don't think I'm coming back. Especially since there are much more affordable fish plates within walking distance of the Crab & Mermaid."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here tonight with some friends that were in town. Food was pretty good, atmosphere was great but at the end of dinner I took my son into the bathroom to change him and there was no changing table! Seriously, no changing table in the woman's restroom. This is a restaurant that has a children's menu and highchairs so obviously they knew people would be bringing their children there and there's no changing table. Guess where I had to change my son's diaper? Yep you guessed it, the bathroom floor. Disgusting. I asked to speak the manager and all he could say that they were trying to rectify the situation. He did apologize however it was less than sincere. I just wonder how hard they are truly trying to rectify the situation considering I was able to look it up on google and see that I could buy one for less than what we spent on dinner. As I was eating dinner here tonight, I was thinking how this was such a great a place to bring out of town friends and family but unfortunately I will not be back. I will also make sure to let all of my mama friends know as well because no one should have to change their babies diaper the floor in public restroom."}
{"text":"Not sure why people criticise so harshly on this place. It may be small, but the fish is great and drinks as well. This isn't California where fish is extremely easy to get, this is Arizona and they do a great job at getting fish daily.   I ordered:  Oysters and they were phenomenal.   Yellow tomato gazpacho was a great take on a summer soup.   The happy hour cocktail which included peach purée, bottle lemon soda, yuzu.   If you are coming for seafood, this is the place to go that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had Halibut, and my wife had Mahi-Mahi .  Both were excellent.  Price was reasonable.  Atmosphere is very casual, with not a lot of seating inside. A little noisy, but other than that it was good.  They could use more parking."}
{"text":"Way over priced, the lump crab cakes were mush, shrimp tacos had 1 small shrimp each, and the gumbo was aweful. The service was great as were the oysters and the frnch fries...will not be back"}
{"text":"Great place for affordable seafood . Inside and outside dining . Started off with raw clams and oysters . Fresh , big and delicious . They came with mignonette sauce , cocktail and horseradish .   Didn't order any alcohol but there were plenty of choices .   For dinner fish(cod) and chips and chiopinno . The fish and chips were cooked perfectly . They came out with a thick tarter sauce and ketchup . (Vinegar was already at the table) The real star of the show was the chiopinno . Served in a big pot with two pieces of crusty bread with romesco sauce . It was loaded with seafood and the stock(broth) was full of flavor . Mussels(in shell) , shrimp,scallops, squid and a fish of the day. My only tip is to stir the pot often or else the last few bites will get a bit salty . I didn't ask for more bread but thinking about it I should have to soak up that soup !   Would definitely return . Service was very attentive . Clarissa was great !"}
{"text":"For seafood in the southwest it's great choice and you can't go wrong. Let's all admit seafood in our location isn't going to be fresh off the boat.  Our waitress, Jess, was great in helping us chose our meals. I loved the clam chowder and oysters on the half shell. For appetizers they are reasonable since we are not on the ocean. I got the lobster roll and my dining partners got the scallops meal and cioppino.   We all loved our choices and we all agree we would return. We truly hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"First visit today! Food was awesome Had the lobster roll, clam chowder, crab cakes and crispy calamari! Everything was perfect!  Will be going back!  The young lady was very helpful with suggestions! Now one more of our favorite places in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today for a quick bite at a different environment. We sat on the patio and loved the atmosphere! It reminded us of being on vacation at the beach.   Unfortunately, the food and drinks are over priced for the quality and portions and our waitress was the only one working the patio so service was very slow. We weren't in a hurry but we even passed on another drink due to how long it would take to actually get the drink.  Don't get me wrong, our waitress was sweet and we will likely come again but we will probably pass on the food and come for happy hour drinks instead."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and every time is consistently good.  Good drinks, good food, great service all make for a really enjoyable experience.  Let's face it, there aren't many seafood places around so we really welcome this place.  We've tried something different each time we've gone and everything we've ordered has been full of seafood that is cooked well and it's full of flavor.  The decor is cute and the bathrooms are clean.  We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch.  A bit expensive for level of quality.  Sat a bar, service was personal and efficient.  Po Boy description mentioned a traditional cornmeal coating (which in New Orleans means crunchy).   My shrimp were similar to a beer batter which quickly turned mushy.    Might return for a yet to be established happy hour, but for now.... AZ still can't get the seafood category right..."}
{"text":"I'm a Maryland native and their crab cakes are amazing! Big lumps of crab meat! The fish and chips... Wow! Obviously fresh fish, tender, perfectly cooked, crispy batter."}
{"text":"Oh man!!! Went to lunch today with some girlfriends to plan an upcoming work event and the food and atmosphere here was perfection. It was my first time and will for sure be bringing my husband back for date night!  Had a little bit of everything but my most favorite was the Lobster Mac N Cheese!!!! Holy wow!!! It was the perfect amount of lobster and spice! Probably a good thing I live in Gilbert or I would have this several times a week!!  I also tried the Fish N Chips. The tartar sauce was delicious and the batter on the fish and the fries were amazing!  The crispy fried coconut shrimp was delicious as well as the Crab Cakes and Artichoke Dip.  There wasn't one thing I tried that I wouldn't order again or recommend!!! Love everything about this place and the waitress was great too!  For sure going back! Adding a few photos I snapped!"}
{"text":"I met my son here today for a late lunch at around 3:00.  It was pretty quiet due to the time. I have been dying to come here since I saw that it opened as I grew up in MA and needed a good seafood restaurant here in Scottsdale.  We both got the lobster rolls which were absolutely amazing! The cole slaw was awesome and the potato chips were just like Cape Cod chips but homemade good!!  The only thing that would have made our experience better was more attention to the basics. Our water was empty for a bit and we waited way too long for our check especially since it was not busy at all. I will be back with family and friends because the food is wonderful but there should be more customer service improvements."}
{"text":"The scallops were the worst I've had and I've been to many great seafood restaurants. The service was extremely slow. The experience was decent. I would not recommend overall."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Love the casual atmosphere, and patio on Scdl Rd. Greater warmly and was busy for 6pm on Friday . Rich Moe is a craft cocktail genius! I have been a  bartender for 15 years and he taught me a few things. Huge selection of fine fare but also a create your own dish selection that is great. We had the bacon wrapped shrimp, scallop ceviche, both great together, ceviche is creamy with coconut milk, not traditional, but paired nice with salty and savory bacon wrapped shrimp. Crusted halibut was tender and delicious . We also had several craft cocktails...all perfect! Must try this place ...sit at the bar, great view. Ask for Rich!"}
{"text":"A little pricey-  but it is all seafood, so I'll give it a pass, just not sure I'll be going here a lot. Staff was friendly and efficient for a brand new place. Menu reflected the design theme of the restaurant- sort of beachfront, seaside in terms of atmosphere and menu offerings. Had the salad nicoise- it was fine, nothing made it stand out. I'd give it another try for when I wanted something more substantial - like fish and chips or steamers with garlic bread. Bring a light sweater, with the walls open, there was a lot of crosswinds."}
{"text":"Monday 12:30 Noon Lunch Easy seating Friendly Hostess & Waitress Lovely inside Casual, sunny day, sat inside.   A well stocked menu showing East/West coast and Gulf seafood treats. The food selection was not the problem. I could have ordered numerous items as they all looked good. Ordered Buffalo Popcorn Shrimp appetizer & standard 'Fish & Chips' + Iced Tea  Buffalo Popcorn Shrimp smelled spicy, tasted spicy but was otherwise very bland. As if I had already eaten a few already and now my taste buds just acknowledged that one typical wing taste. I didnt taste the shrimp at all, it was just chewy.  'Fish & Chips' - Greasy, bland & boring. I've been called a 'plain eater' before because I like simply food. This was on the other side of me simple because it lacked any real taste effort at all. Cod that was battered and fried and then placed on my plate greasy is not enticing.   Total price with tip $35. Not worth it.  Though this place may get an edited review in the future I am disinterested in going back at this moment."}
{"text":"The oysters were great. The fish and chips were really good too. Messed up on a Po Boy and a crab Louie salad. Overall good and will come back to give them another try"}
{"text":"Crab & Mermaid was ranked as one of the top 10 BNRs by Phoenix magazine this month and we had a birthday to celebrate. In a nutshell, if this is one of our best new restaurants, we need to try harder.   First thing, make it easier to find in the dark. There is no bright signage that catches your eye as you drive down busy Scottsdale Road. Maybe I'm just old, but I missed it.   Good news- the cocktails were tasty and had generous pours of alcohol. I had  a Ron, Jerry & Me, a spiced rum tropical juice concoction that was easy to drink and packed a bit of punch. Someone else had a mule and one had a Passion Beach Punch, all good drinks. Service was also pleasant and nicely paced.   Now the food. Not impressed, not even a little bit. I chose to split a lobster roll with my husband. We ordered it hot, no spicy aioli. It came cold. The roll, the lobster- cold. The lobster also had a funky tang to it. The chips were fine, the slaw was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The birthday guest had tacos and was not too thrilled. He thought they lacked flavor. Someone else ordered the lobster mac & cheese. The sauce, thin and not very cheesy, pooled at the bottom of the dish. There was plenty of lobster, but the whole thing was bland.   Now you would think we would have packed it up and left, but we gave dessert a whirl. Don't. Just don't. The cheesecake was marginal and the ice cream cookie sandwich was standard fare.   All told, the bill was $115. I think that's too high for substandard food. Seriously, Phoenix has better options, even for seafood."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night craving a lobster roll I ordered it spicy  there was   very little   lobster  roll was soggy   not  worth 22$"}
{"text":"I enjoy seafood and like the sister restaurant Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers so was excited to try it.  Went for lunch and sat on the patio enjoying one of the last cool days of the year. We like to try appetizers so we ordered a cup of clam chowder each and then shared the crab cakes, crabby spinach dip and the coconut scallop ceviche.  The clam chowder was great - one of my favorites.  It's topped with bacon which gave it a bit of a crunch.  After the soup our 3 appetizers came out.  I liked the crab cakes. Very flavorful. Not a lot of sauce with them, but tasty.  The crabby spinach dip looked wonderful but had no taste what so ever. It was VERY bland!  The ceviche was ok but also pretty bland.  The server was friendly and nice but our glasses were empty for quite some time before we got a refill.  Would we go back?  Maybe for the clam chowder and the  crab cakes.  But there are other places that have the same two dishes and serve them just as well.."}
{"text":"Great setting for bar / seafood restaurant.  I am a Bloody Mary expert and the one they made with the anchovy salt was awesome.  One of the top three I have had from a flavor perspective.  Our server was extremely attentive and fun.  Don't get the popcorn shrimp appetizer.... It was all breading, although the dipping sauces were great.  Do try the mussels... Large and very flavorful.  Also had the homemade chips which were good.  For an entree I had the seafood gumbo.  It was more stew like than soup like.  A perfect amount of spice so I was happy.  My son got the calamari steak which was different.  I am going to try again and maybe get one of their fish of the day specials.  I think the place to be is at the bar if you can.  Try the Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but the service overall was slow, food was sub-par and loaded with salt."}
{"text":"I think the mermaid drowned.  Went there last night.  Ordered clam chowder. It came out cold, then we sent it back and came back somewhat warmer  It was a cup of soup they put into a bowl. looked like it was more bowl then soup.  Mediocre.  Had fish and chips.....very greasy and the fries had enough salt on them for a months supply of salt.  Finished up with bananas foster....our fault....we missed the part that it was a trifle.  pudding instead of ice cream. you know when you look forward to having something and it comes out differently you are disappointed. That is what happened here.  We were expecting a reals Foster and got pudding with some cookies and whipped cream. Too sweet for me and not worth the calories, fat or taste.  I would say that it was a below average meal. Emily our server was amazing and the best part of the meal. I commend her for that.  The rest.....I think I would pass if I were you.  I must be missing what everyone else sees.   I am a pretty good judge of food in the valley as well from mom and pop places to fancy places. I was really hoping to like this place as well since there are not many decent affordable seafood places."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came in for restaurant week so we ordered the 3 course meal. Shrimp ceviche, two lobster tails and a banana foster.   The Shrimp ceviche was good but the corn chips were a bit stale.  The lobster was amazing. #foodgasm  The banana foster was half filled.. (not what it it looked like in pictures)    Other than that, her and I went around the entire restaurant taking selfies cause the under the sea decor was so cute!  Customer Service was wonderful! They helped us every time we needed something :)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! Fresh seafood!! Service is awesome! Amazing cioppino! Baked clams! Lobster roll! YUM!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for lunch at 2pm. Can't really rate the food because our appetizer was delivered to the wrong table that just sat down at the bar and we were the only other table in there. Bartender immediately realized the mistake and said something to the food runner but never came to our table. So I guess they had a 50/50 chance of getting it right. We walked out. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the scallops grilled with orzo and asparagus. They were great! The service was just ok, and the appetizer came out with our meal, so overall experience makes this 3 instead of 5."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant since I love seafood and there aren't many options in Scottsdale. The concept is also really cute and casual. We went on Saturday night and the restaurant was full but not overly busy. Hostesses seemed flustered. However, they have an app that allows you to see how many parties are before you, which is a nice touch.   When we were seated, we were put at a high top right by the bar. There was a really loud drunk party standing by the bar and one of the men kept touching our table and setting his drink down, clearly unconcerned that a party was not sitting there. Although not the restaurants fault at all, I was really looking forward to our meal and wanted the experience to be a positive one. I asked the hostess with the long dark hair if would be possible to wait for the next available table. She gave MAJOR attitude and told me I would need to wait another 25 minutes because other people were waiting and that she sat us there \"because were a two top.\" I was a hostess when I was in high school at a very customer service orientated restaurant and I can't even believe this was the response. I rarely complain to wait staff, but this was ridiculous. While yes, I know it's \"annoying\" to seat a party of two at a table you could seat a larger party at, you shouldn't express it to the guest. When you're spending more than $100 on dinner, you expect to be accommodated. She rolled her eyes at me when I asked to speak to a manager, the manager didn't even bother to come over. He did however, tell her to move us to another table and we were seated. I was about to walk out based on that experience.   However, our server Hannah was incredible! She really turned the experience around. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations. We started with oysters and calms from the raw bar to start. I ordered the lobster roll which was really good and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips. We both enjoyed our meals. Drinks were also great. I ordered the strawberry Moscow Mule, which was so good.   Overall, I'm pretty turned off by my experience with the hostess and I don't know if I'll come back. Your hostess needs a major attitude adjustment and to realize that customer service is just as important as having great food and drinks. However, Hannah was awesome and definitely deserves some props!"}
{"text":"Update- the owner just sent us a gift card so I will be trying it out again and look forward to leaving an updated review!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were watery and bland (grilled) and the lime rice was tasteless and undercooked.  Crab cakes were outrageously priced (14 for 2 small cc) and were definitely taken out of the freezer. Drinks, decor and service takes it up to 3 stars.  Have to step it up to survive this town!"}
{"text":"Well, sorry to say that I was very disappointed with this restaurant.     We were heading to Cold Beer and Cheese burgers when we saw this place was open so we thought we would give it a try.    We ordered he popcorn buffalo shrimp to start......bad decision.  First off we were one table of about 4 at lunchtime and it took forever to get this dish out.   We could not tell if there was any shrimp in them.....mainly just batter and VERY over cooked.  It came with no dipping sauce so we asked for some.....didn't help....never order this.   We ordered King Crab Legs for the main course...it was \"market price\"....and for that we got two very small legs that they cut in half, a cheap plastic bib, a cardboard something to put the eaten legs in and a \"cracker\"......it was a joke.  No lemon served with the crab and butter was like the butter flavoring you find at theaters......bland and not good.      Sorry gang, get ready for the next restaurant to open there if they don't change their ways.    I tried to give it two stars but my inner self just wouldn't let me.  UPDATE  After the owners response I will amend as I have read the other reviews......  She is very polite to answer such a negative review and I will try it again.......I will upgrade to two stars (not that anyone cares but me) but any owner who will face this music deserves the best opportunity......In the next couple of days I will go back.   Thank you."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant lunch at the Crab and Mermaid. Our server, Hannah, was such a friendly and capable server. I confided to her that although I love seafood, I had never eaten a raw oyster. She brought one single blue point for me to try with mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce. Loved it! But we were there for the lobster rolls, so that was what we ordered. The lobster rolls come cold or warm, spicy or plain. We prefer warm, on a buttered roll. They serve it with very good cole slaw and scrumptious Cape Codder chips seasoned with Old Bay Seasoning. A great value at $22. The lobster was sweet and tasty, although the texture was a little tougher than I'd like. Still with the great atmosphere and wonderful service we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Old Town with decor and a feel that can't be found anywhere else in the Valley. Started with the Ahi Poke and Chowder, both were phenomenal. Lobster Roll won't disappoint and at $20, it's far superior than any place serving it with in the general vicinity! Hubby did the Seafood Gumbo and said quote, \"this is the best damm thing I have ate in a while\". My Oldest kid had popcorn shrimp and my pickiest went with chicken fingers. So don't worry there is plenty of options for your little ones.  Service was good and not pretentious. This is a casual seafood joint where every one can come enjoy a good meal. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a dinner with the lady here and we both loved it. The three cocktails we had (Elyxn, Layered Sangria, and Merman) were all very good. Tried all three oyster types and all were above average, especially for being in the desert. Had the lobster roll (hot and spicy), chowder, and crab legs as our mains and were impressed by all of them. Nice to know I get can get a solid lobster roll now when the Maine Lobster Lady isnt in town...  Overall, a welcome addition to Old Town and the growing valley seafood scene."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday lunch.  Both of us had the lobster rolls.  Worst ones I've eaten.  They were so dry and cost $22 a piece!  The slaw was ok and the cilantro rice was nothing special.  Too bad because I love the ambiance and wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a seafood restaurant open up in old town! And it did not disappoint- everything was absolutely delicious and fresh. Their drinks were also on point- amazing cocktails. Service was also very friendly and the atmosphere on the patio was perfect for the spring weather in Scottsdale. The chill music added to their beachy vibe. Overall a great spot just a bit pricy but that's what you can expect for great seafood in the desert!"}
{"text":"I tried this during Spring Restaurant Week (sorry I'm a little behind) and it was delicious!! The Buffalo Popcorn Shrimp we had to start was amazing! I had the Crab Cake for my meal and my friend had the Fish and Chips! The crab cake was phenomenal great texture, fried just right, loved every minute of eating it.  The fish and chips was also absolutely delightful very light and crisp, not greasy at all! We had the most amazing rice krispy treat for dessert, I totally loved it!"}
{"text":"Much more approachable than buck n whatever...very casual, actually nice food servers & mgmt--what a concept! The food is spot on & prices reasonable for what you get & you don't have to valet! Not far from arcadia either...nice job!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about the opening of the Crab & Mermaid. The menu and food looked great so the wife took me out for a little dinner date. The interior looks really nice. They have a raw bar and a nice patio.   What we ordered and what we thought: - Caramelized Shrimp (Sounded great...wasn't. Bland sauce and a strong taste of Worcestershire sauce like there was way to much.) - Fish n' Chips (Was the worst of the dishes. Fries not that crispy and the fish batter was very greasy like when you fry food at a low temp) - Fish Taco's w/cilantro lime rice (Was the better of the dishes. Lime rice was okay and the tacos were acceptable)  All-in-all is was a disappointing experience. Was hoping to be pleased but we ended up feeling like dopes cause we spent $70 bucks on inferior food. They did give us a little break on the fish n chips to the credit of our waitress. Our waitress rocked! She was so nice.   Would I be back? Not likely. I really don't want to get burned again. I get that they are new and have to work out some bugs but this is Scottsdale and Scottsdale prices. With the amount of options in this town you have to always be on your game."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was luke warm and not very tasty. Shrimp PO boy was a little better but nothing to scream about. It was worth a try but we won't be going back. Serving staff was great and the environment was pleasant but for the price the food just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"I find it very classy and professional for the business owner to personally reply to each comment. Though I had a bad experience the first time, I  will try it again. I understand it is a new restaurant and employees (including cooks) need to get the hang of things.  Thank you for reaching out (to everyone) to make things better and thank everyone (good or bad) for their review.  Great customer service!"}
