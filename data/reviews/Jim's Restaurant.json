{"text":"The male owner (son of the original Jim) is an asshole.  He berates and passive-aggressively abuses his staff, and his cooking is substandard.  The female cook (occasionally there, brunette with medium /short hair) is a great cook and a nice person.  I like the female servers, especially the sweet older white-bread gal (no disrespect meant), but I think she split cuz of Mr Owner Man... the greek waitress is super sweet, too.  The beer-swilling crowd has generally split to the \"steak house\" next door (which boasts an owner who used to be a cook at the Tulip...but it now sucks huge).  Jim's restaurant quality has, overall, taken a dive, about a 35% decrease in quality over the past 3 years, but it still has it's merits, if you are not expecting too much.  Good breakfasts, and a healthy blue-collar take-out crowd.  Too bad about the pics of dead deers that the owner/family has hunted.  Likewise, the long-dead homage to the Paradise Riders (Motorcycle \"Club``) on the dusty over-crowded shelves is indicative of it`s past popularity...and of the fact that unlike the PDR`s, it is still in the `hood and has not moved on with the times..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the old school --- ie places where you can get traditional, great, simple food for great prices.  Jim's is one of my regular go-to's, when I don't go to the overpriced yuppy places in my Leslieville hood.     Best:  roast chicken; homefries; chicken soup; and of course the famous Jim's Western Sandwich (3 inches thick ! )..  ....I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  It ain't pretty...it ain't yuppy (thank God)... but it's been around a long time and it does the basics very very well...do yourself a favour and pass by one day."}
{"text":"I go there for breakfast religiously and I never get disappointed by their friendly staffs, owner and food. Their home fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Looking for a home style breakfast with friendly service?  You gotta try Jim's.   The food quality is great. The peameal bacon is awesome. Service is FRIENDLY.   Small place but cozy.   The cook, Mimi, places the cooked bacon on paper towels to absorb the excess grease.  Wow! You won't regret this cozy diner. Not important but the coffee is NOT bottomless; I don't mind that at all."}
{"text":"Jim's is absolutely flawless for the type of restaurant that it is.  Fantastic selection, hearty, tasty food, huge portions, cheap prices and good service.  TVs and interesting pictures adorn the walls for those who may want to switch off from the eccentric conversations you can hear from some regular patrons!  Staff are friendly, off-beat, down to earth and efficient and fast at doing their jobs.  Sure, if you come here expecting haute cuisine or even a standard Leslieville bistro brunch you will leave feeling disillusioned, but the beauty of Jim's is that it's different!  Jim's makes me wonder why at times I line up for twenty minutes outside other establishments to pay twice the price, for half the food, without the luxury (yes, I'm calling Jim's luxurious!) of being able to stay and chat and relax after my meal.  Everyone should try it at least once! Only the pretentious will be disappointed ;)"}
{"text":"I live in the west end but do some work in Leslieville here and there and discovered Jim's a couple months ago on a dry mouthed morning after when I was looking to fill my stomach and get the taste out of my mouth from the jar of pennies I had drunkenly eaten the night before, and it did not disappoint.  I consider myself to be a bit of a connoisseur of the cheap greasy breakfast, and Jim's lives up in that regard. I've been there a half dozen times now and I always order the same thing. My over-easy eggs are made right in front of me while I sit at the bar watching CP24 or admiring the signs instructing those looking for a rush order to go to \"Helen Waite\". Why anyone would need a rush order here is beyond me. The longest I've been here was a half hour one week when they were slammed. I'm usually in and out within 20 minutes (they make your order the same way I eat it - FAST).  The white toast is fluffy and perfect, the sausages are standard deep fried lard tubes and they make those old man homefries that are just a big pile of soft potatoes in the corner of the flat top grill, half cubed, half mushed. So awesome. The staff alternates between warm, blunt and indifferent, and the place seems to be perpetually frequented by a mixture of blue collar worker types, middle class families and people who probably spend a large portion of their day on the sidewalk.   I'm a classic breakfast guy, but I've watched the cooks concoct many of their signature westerns from my perch at the counter, and they look completely fucking insane. Maybe I'll order one one day. Awesome shitty diner. If you want a standard working-class egg plate, quick and cheap, at 9 bucks tip-in, you can't lose."}
{"text":"Love this place. In it's space, it doesn't get much better.  Old school, consistent solid food. The western omlette with cheese is a superstar.  Also, for some reason their bacon is WAY better than anyone else's.  Go there....trust in me."}
{"text":"Good location in lesiliveille, good food and good enovironment. Tried the poutine which is well made and tasted good. A great place to quickly grab some food"}
{"text":"update  i went back a couple of more times.  the patrons hadn't changed, however i did try the steak and eggs.  i've had better, but wasn't disappointed like i was the first time with their banquet burger.  i'll go again, but only because i want to eat at a divey diner.  jim's is exactly that - my expectation of this place is subzero,  eat at own risk."}
{"text":"I go to Jim's at least once a week.  As far as greasy spoons go, it's the standard.    It is a staple in Leslieville, and shouldn't be overlooked despite the daunting appearance commented on here by some.  Service is great, staff is friendly (even the 'asshole' cook/owner), food is consistently well made, and served quickly.    If you are expecting something fancier, go wait in line outside Lady Marmalade with all the other 905ers and west enders, and overpay for lesser quality.    If you want a plain and simple diner breakfast that never disappoints, go to Jim's.    Greek salad is worth trying."}
{"text":"The owner/cook is a total asshole! Treats his staff like shit and is incredibly demeaning. Food not much better than his attitude. Wait staff is still super sweet despite his chastising remarks in front of customers."}
{"text":"Cheap diner.  The staff are just great though.  But the guy in the kitchen, who manages the till...is just huge rude.  $8.60 is the bill, give him $10, and he keeps the change, after I tipped the waitress $3.  Then he just stares at me when he closes the till.  What a jerk.  Ironically you hear him arguing with the staff about \"keep my customers happy\".  Fine, they should toss you out, you chincey thief."}
{"text":"$6 (plus tax) for a 2 eggs, 3 sausages, home fries and toasts, plus coffee. It's a really good deal!  The place was super busy but the staff was still very friendly.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Joined two friends for a 9:30 breakfast today (Wednesday).  My veggie omelet, despite the onions, green pepper and tomatoes, was virtually tasteless.  I'm not sure how they managed that, but I needed to add salt, which I virtually never do.  The omelet and my home fries arrived lukewarm.  Brown toast was Wonder-bread style.  My friends, who had the 2-egg special, had nothing to rave about, but each enjoyed their respective bacon, one pea-meal (thick!) and one conventional.  Each coffee refill was billed like a new coffee (1.25), so that added an unexpected 2.50 to our breakfasts since we weren't told about it.  (Of the 27 breakfast places I've reviewed for Yelp, I believe this is the first place to do this.  See http://www.yelp.ca/list/breakfast-places-toronto)  An average/below average greasy spoon breakfast.  No need to rush back."}
{"text":"This is the type of unpretentious greasy spoon diner that I look for. The breakfast special was very good. The home fries weren't greasy. The coffee was good and the service friendly."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go. Take this as a warning folks. If you have a favourite place to dine, go often before it turns into a condo. That's what is happening here. Best breakfast in town guaranteed. Thick slices of Canadian bacon like no other. Friendly service, once they know you and you don't show up for a while, you will be scorned. Now that's customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome WESTERNS!!!!! not a fan of the homefries and the westerns are pretty big. Great place."}
{"text":"Philosophically speaking, one has a dilemma when rating a low end diner: we're talking about plastic tablecloths and crooked tables at a greasy spoon where you load up on bacon and eggs; but the food is so damn good when you're hung over or just plain hungry and want lots of food fast, so how do you rate this place? The western omelette is big - so full of ham, onions and cheddar that I can barely finish it. The peameal comes sliced so thick it resembles a steak. You get the idea on the food, and your wallet still has something left when you leave. The place kind of reminds me of the old SNL skit where John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd were cooks at a local diner. I keep expecting to hear \"Cheeburger! Cheeburger!\" from behind the counter. Honestly, the place is as unpretentious as humanly possible, and I keep going back because it's all just about getting decent food fast and cheap."}
{"text":"The Dafos has bought Gingerman Diner at Victoria Park and St. Clair apparently. https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/29/jim-restaurant-is-about-to-serve-its-last-best-western.html"}
{"text":"\"Situated on a corner of a small plaza, Jim's had a local feel to it. Their narrow horizontal sign really made this place seem like a verity store.\" \"Also, note that they only accept cash (with an ATM in-house). Despite all the not-so-perfect details, we really enjoyed this place. Felt very true and warm.\" Just a few bites from our full review"}
{"text":"Could it have been more thematically perfect than to have walked in to Jim's Restaurant, boaster of the Best Western sandwich in the city, while the  Jimmy Stewart classic Flight of the Phoenix was playing on the teevee just above the bar?  I dont think so.  Though Jimmy was not alone in his occupying of the spotlight at this moment.  For there were two other Jims present.  One sat framed as a monument on a shelf, with simple white ring-around-the-head hair and white moustache, bookending about five simple choices of beer.  The other sat in the middle of the restaurant, black toque atop his head, enjoying the famous Best Western and a Coors Lite, doing his due diligence for his upcoming review on yelp.com.  Well the western indeed WAS the best part of the meal, so kudos to them.  i got it on brown bread with fries and salad (this was the Best Western Deluxe) and a side of gravy and mayo.  Surprisingly, it wasnt greasy at all.  It was very filling and filled with ham.  My fries were crispy.  My salad was DRENCHED in dressing - not to my liking, as I ordered the Coors Lite for a drink and not the vinegar-based river that was drooling down my face despite my attempt at good family etiquette.  The gravy, was strange - not bad per se, but something was strange about it.  It tasted funny.  I wish I could describe it better, but I wouldnt order it again.  The 10 bucks I spent for the whole deal, however, included a peak into a business that still uses a Hamilton Beach milkshake blender, pastel green, easily from the 50s it would seem; it silently cheered for a muscle-clad female bodybuilder that stood guard posing in photos displayed above their menu on the wall and watched with care as a mildly shifty girl was allowed to use the washroom with no purchase expected to follow.  For the simple comfort and community of the home-style stuff you grew up on or need for the night after, Jim is your man."}
{"text":"I love diners and a greek owned diner is typically the best. This place fails on so many levels, quality of food, service, cleanliness. You can tell a lot about how much pride the owner takes in their place by their bathroom. Not here, spend a few bucks and go elsewhere...I live in the area, so was hopeful for a clean, friendly inexpensive option. Sigh, I really miss the Leslieville Diner even more now."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Jim's over the past 2 weeks and I have only two words for you: PEAMEAL SANDWICH.  If I had to add two more words, they would be 'on rye.'  Jim's serves what I would generally consider to be peameal steaks on beautiful light rye toast.    The good: - it is very busy in here, all the time, and has a classier crowd than RJ's next door - everything is affordable - all servings are between large and huge - the food is made right in front of you - the light rye bread is spectacular  The bad: - my bread is always soggy by the time I get my sandwich home, so either open it up to let the steam out or eat it there - I wouldn't eat anything here other than a 'breakfast-type' sandwich - an omelette, a western, an all day breakfast etc... I probably wouldn't get a burger here and the fries are disgusting.  I will be making this a regular stop for sandwiches in this area.  I will also be back to try the all day breakfast for $4.25.   Cash only."}
{"text":"Its with a twinge of sadness that I write this review, as today while i was picking up my toasted western I was alerted that yet another bygone relic of Toronto's past, Jim's Restaurant, will be closing its doors next week to make way for a new condo...   This is an old school diner, run by greek people (as all diners are and should be).  I have only had one menu item, but boy is it good. Guessed it? yes, its the toasted western.  Hulking, massive amount of egg omlete, cooked on the flat top, sitting in between two nicely toasted slices of bread. Ketchup and Mayo on the same side to give me as close to a russian dressing as I can get with lettuce and tomato for the necessary crunch (and fiber, for the butthole).  Youve got a week left, so if youre hungry or hungover, make your way over to Jim's (they are moving north but i cant be caught dead north of bloor :( )."}
{"text":"I'm a service guy and have travelled the roads a lot, I use to eat a lot too but the extra weight has slowed down my eating. When I worked down by Jims I'd have to go in and get something. A small last of its kind mom and pop shop I would expect a home made meal. Some times greasy but mmmm always so good! You should try the peameal bacon on a Kaiser. Make sure your hungry and you'll never forget it! I've had bacon and eggs, hamburger fries and all of it was good. Will definitely go and support him at the next location! Hopefully he can take his signs, and continue to paint his advertising on his windows. It's so old school but a lost art!"}
