{"text":"Best hot beef in town plus Frans other restaurant west on Main about a mile!!
Very clean inside and family owned. Spend your money in two of Fran's great restaurants that are in Mesa and you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Awful service from the start. We seated our selves and after 5+ minutes a man took our drink orders and walked off to sit down and eat. We waved down what appeared to be another waitress to ask for coffee creamer and menus, she said she wasn't our waitress and to share 2 menus amongst three of us because she didn't want to walk to the other side of the very small dining room to grab another. She said she didn't know who was suppose to wait on us and walked away. A male employee ran out and shouted across that the toilet was overflowing in the ladies restroom. 15+ minutes later a lady walked over after another customer mentioned we hadn't been served. She said our waitress had left and they didn't realize it. When telling her our orders she had no idea what the prices were and what came with each meal so she had to keep searching through the menu. Asked for oil and vinegar on my salad which she checked for and they didn't have any she offered to squirt lemon on it. At this point we offered to pay for our coffee and leave because our nerves were shot. The waitress questioned why and we stated how awful the service was and she told us not to pay and just leave. We left and went to east valley cafe which was by far better customer service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times than I can count now. Seldom had a poor meal. I've tried a few things on the menu I wouldn't order again but that's me, not them.

Earlier in 2018 Fran retired and a new family runs the place now and I gotta say the food is very good. Their breakfast skillets are great and huge too. 

Last I heard the name of this restaurant will be changing soon. 

This a primarily a breakfast and lunch operation.

During the summer they change hours after the snowbirds leave and most restaurants in the area don't make much money, so always keep an eye on the sign in the window. I think as of today they're closed on Mondays, but check that for yourself, it could change again.

I've had their Famous Fish several times and always liked it. And I'm a person who dislikes most seafood."}
{"text":"I'm honestly kind of disapointed. I loved the old location, but the new one seemed to be completely un-organized and it's lost some of it's mom and pop shop charm. The food was still pretty good, service not so much, but it was a lot of the staff's first day so I'm sure by now things are a lot better."}
{"text":"From the looks of the photos it seems they finally learned how to make a monte Cristo. When I went in awhile back and ordered one I got a ham and turkey  on toast. The server assured me that's how they make them. Very underwhelmed. Have not been back since but may try it again"}
{"text":"Same menu as Fran's Place, just a lot quieter. Went there this morning and got the scrambler and wife got the big pig omelette. We got there shortly before lunchtime. The place began to fill up and there were about 20 people there when we left. Food was out quickly and was fantastic. We will definitely be frequenting this location."}
{"text":"There were some problems with staff in Nov.   my understanding is another place took her experienced workers.   We had one bad day and one where we left without ordering.    

But we have been back 3 or 4 times over the holidays.   Pleased to say that they are back to being the best deal around.  Good food, good prices and decent wait persons"}
{"text":"I used to eat at her other restaurant and it was great. But this new place is missing so much of the original charm and food quality. I actually had a waitress tell me not order something I wanted because it wasn't good anymore and needed to be thrown out. She whispered this to me because Fran was willing to serve it still. When entering the place, Fran is cold and unfriendly. Didn't enjoy my time there, won't be back. What a shame."}
{"text":"The hot beef sandwich, not very good at all , gravy was very salty,, beef was very dry dry mashed potatoes no flavor, big disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place busy but great food! Kinda busy but worth it. Lots of older folks. Home cookin nice people. A little on the small side but not too shabby. Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop breakfast spot. I got the two egg breakfast with potatoes and toast. Everything was cooked perfectly. I just wanted a little more peppers in my potatoes but that's me just being picky. Also how can you not love a place with cowboy boot cups!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this wonderful little place for breakfast and it was wonderful! Had the biscuits and gravy and it's even better than my mom's recipe. So good. Can't wait to take my daughter. Great customer service and they have pies! I'll be back soon. Great little mom and pop place to support."}
{"text":"The best home cooking and town nothing out of the box , Fish on Fridays is best ,On Sunday she hasTurkey just like your mom used to make so if you want good home cooking come to Franagans, The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Service was fast and friendly. If you like the cafe environment then I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fran is a lovely lady.  It's awesome being able to have home cooked meals like back home in MN. Can't wait to try the Walleye. Thanks Fran and crew!  Very friendly place highly recommend!"}
