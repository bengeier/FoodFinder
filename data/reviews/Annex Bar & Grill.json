{"text":"Are you looking for greasy canadian-style chinese food and cheap beer?
Do you mind sitting in a dark basement tavern?
Do you enjoy watching CP24 while you eat?
Then Annex Bar and Grill might be the place for you!

The food is surprisingly tasty. Try the fried rice or fried dumplings. Or fried chicken balls..
The owners are very friendly and the price is right. The ambiance leaves a bit to be desired, but they do have a fish tank and copies of the Toronto Sun to entertain you."}
{"text":"Not fancy! Precisely the opposite in fact. But if you are looking for an incredibly cheap meal that is actually not bad, this is the place. Classic Chinese-Canadian greasy spoon. There is something about Chinese restaurant french fries that hits the spot. I eat lunch here more than is probably good for my health."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. I like it because you get more food and better quality for less $$ than you would at a drive thru (which people have always defended because they are \"cheap\" but they're not anymore!)

The food here is home made and it's not bad. You won't find anything fancy so don't come here looking for that 

The decor is very, very tired and has that old home smell. The equipment is old too. And they are cash only. But they have wifi :)"}
