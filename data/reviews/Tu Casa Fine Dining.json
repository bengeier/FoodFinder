{"text":"Tu Casa is a very nice, fine-dining restaurant in the heart of Lorne Park. If you're looking for a nice dinner out or somewhere to celebrate I recommend this restaurant. 
The service and the food were amazing. All of the daily specials sounded good it was hard to decide what to get - I had the pasta special of the day which was a vegetable ravioli - it was really good - all fresh and homemade. 
The owners also seemed very nice. They heard we were celebrating and brought over glasses of champagne and also a dessert wine at the end of our meal.  

The restaurant is pricey so I couldn't afford it all of the time, but is worth it for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, delicious food with perfect sized portions. Wait staff did a fantastic job and it was not too unreasonably priced. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for memorable dining experience, Tu Casa is the place to be. From the vast selection of wines to the delectable offerings on the menu, we were not disappointed. The staff were friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is warm & cozy."}
{"text":"I celebrated there my anniversary with my partner. The atmosphere is quite calm an appropiated for these occasions. The wine was very good. Regarding the food, the tuna tartar was tasty but the rest of dishes were very mediocre. The duck and sirloin were terrible:dry and with the same sauce. Too expensive, 180 $."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service at this establishment. We went there for a birthday and they made it very special, even taking a photo and presenting it to us at the end of the meal. The lobster tempura (made with fresh lobster) was to-die-for so if it is on the menu don't miss it! The ONLY reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is that the wine list is very limited and the only wine that we felt was up to the standard of the food was $85. It would be wise for them to include some good but moderate wines on the menu as we will be back for the food but unlikely to order wine with our meal."}
{"text":"Celebrated an anniversary here and had a great experience overall! for appetizers had the platter consisting of shrimps and anti-pesto. it was really good! for the main course I had lobster two ways and my wife had the cod. both dishes were delicious. service was exceptional as well. highly recommended place. great for special occasions!"}
{"text":"We have just returned from our anniversary dinner, our second celebrated here. Both were delicious! Shay was our server, she was lovely and the service was excellent. The lamb to die for, fish was excellent, all around a lovely evening. Thank you"}
{"text":"Tu Casa is an excellent restaurant. Is it as amazing as other reviewers are saying it is...not quite.

The service is top-notch at this restaurant. The wait staff is very professional and helpful. They give recommendations based on personal opinions.

The ambience is also very good. The restaurant has your traditional fine-dining 'feel'. Very nice décor.

The food (which is the most important part in my opinion) was good. However, with that being said, the price point for this quality and portion size of food was way too high. I ordered the Salmon with mixed vegetables and rice. It was cooked very well. Unfortunately, I did not get a 'wow'-factor because my family cooks our salmon identically to theirs with the same flavour. I cannot speak about the pasta because I did not try it. My girlfriend did order the pasta and she enjoyed it.

Overall, this is an excellent restaurant. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for special occasion. Service was great from the moment we entered and throughout the entire dining experience. Chef JohnRoss came over to talk to us. He is very friendly.  I had the Surf and Turf which had these huge scallops and tender braised beef. It was delicious.  I asked for simple pasta for my little one and to add scallops and mushrooms. It turned out awesome.  One of my family member had the Nova Scotia lobster with truffle pudding. It's absolutely wonderful. We were all very please and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch on the patio. The salad with organic greens and cashews was perfect, highlighted by the addition of a few, well chosen pickled beets. The penne arrabbiata was piquant, the pasta close to perfection, and the nuggets of sausage carefully sized and placed. A glass of the Lodi Chardonnay was the optimal accompanying beverage.

Service of the highest order, friendly, knowledgeable and efficient."}
{"text":"Ok - this is one of those places that you have to go to before you die. Holy crap!! One of the best restaurants I have been to in this country ... And the \"winter wonderland\" (pictured) is to die for!"}
{"text":"Chef John Ross is brilliantly innovative !!
Been coming here for a while now & the food is always incredible. The daily & weekly specials are great.
Try the new 12 course tasting menu @ the chef's table. 
(Available Friday's & Saturday's )
The staff are always friendly & helpful to."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times the food was excellent and the service was very friendly and professional.   I had surf and turf and my husband had fillet mignon and we had Caesar salad which was big enough for us to share.   We will be back and we highly recommend this restaurant to all of our friends."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star restaurant by anybody's standards, and is up there with the best anywhere on the planet. Make no mistake it is pricey, but would you prefer to eat out twice a month and be reasonably satisfied or would you eat here once a month and be ecstatic. Big pluses are the menu is flexible and Chef Pasqual will accommodate just about any request, the restaurant is fully carpeted which deadens irritating noise, and you are treated like family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day as a last minute decision and was told to come early as they were fully booked. We ordered the beet and arugula salad to start and the cod (not on their regular menu). The cod was cooked to perfection and was accompanied with a creamy, whipped truffle sauce that was delicious. Unfortunately, due to timing issues (someone told us on the phone that we had to be finished dinner by 6:45pm), we didn't try the tasting menu. Other than feeling a little rushed, the food and atmosphere was amazing. Would definitely come back during a less busy time."}
{"text":"Good service. Food was okay. Came in last hour before the kitchen closes.  Nice quiet place for couple to wine and dine."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here and the service and food were both outstanding!  Far exceeded our expectations! We are going back for sure"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, fabulous, classy service, exquisite food, good wine list.  I had the exquisite sea bass with risotto.  It was perfectly cooked, with a delicate but flavorful sauce and risotto.  Didn't have room for dessert.  My husband had the special--cod, with a beautiful assortment of perfectly-prepared vegetables and potatoes.  If I'm every in Mississauga again, I'll return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place. Service is always top notch and I absolutely love the complimentary little touches (a splash of prosecco shortly after you're seated, warm bread with rosemary and evoo while you're waiting for your dinner, a little scoop of lemon sorbet as a palate cleanser between courses). The wine list is very comprehensive and menu items are ever-changing and consistently good. Also, as a vegetarian, I can say they have been great about substituting ingredients to accommodate me. All that, and they have patio seating."}
{"text":"We sat there patiently and watched everyone around us get served. After 20 minutes we told the host no one had come to our table yet. STILL no waiter came for our order. FINALLY the host took our order. Perhaps they were understaffed. 

There was no refill of water glasses or checking up on us to see if we even liked the food. The food was good. The service was. Horrible. Sad. They should have discounted the dinner. Something. Anything. It was soo obvious that it was not going well. Another loyal customer lost ( friends had a similar experience)."}
{"text":"What a great, fun place. Food is out always on point, fine dining that doesnt take itself to serious. Great wine list with a reasonable markup and one of the best scotch lists in Canada. One of the best resturants in GTA,"}
{"text":"Awful food today at dinner, Mahi Mahi special was totally taste less and fish was not cooked properly, curry based glaze had no taste..."}
{"text":"This place is great ! No sorry this place is amazing. We have eaten here more than 3 times this summer and we have brought friends with us too.
The ambiance is very warm, the food is very flavorful and presentation is lovely. The waiters are very friendly and attentive and everyone makes you feel special. That's the key. Great place, good wine and food and superb customer service makes it a great place to come back to and a place to recommend to all."}
{"text":"Always wonderful - food well prepared and presented, staff courteous and friendly and cocktails are prepared to perfection.  Lucky for us we live close by and can enjoy often, which we do."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here last night for his birthday and had a great experience!

The food was phenomenal, and the service was excellent. We started with the anti-Pasto platter which was amazing, succulent shrimp scallops prosciutto. I could have stopped there because I was actually full. It was huge.

For dinner I had the surf and turf, and my boyfriend had the fillet mignon. Both excellent.

We finished off with birthday dessert and Lemon cello, on the house!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Disclosure:  Based on \"Taste of Clarkson\" which was $29.99/dinner for a 3-course, set menu.

Tip:  If they ask whether you would like flat or sparkling water, flat is BOTTLED ($6)!  So anticipate this charge.  Just specify tap if you're still unsure of what you would like to order.

From the set menu, we had the Crab Cake, Roasted Beet Soup (Golden), Pan Seared Arctic Char (replaced by Salmon), Oven Roasted Pork Tenderloin, & Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee.  

Out of apps, Crab Cake was better than soup.  I was a bit annoyed that they replaced Arctic Char, with the pedestrian Salmon which is a less expensive fish and more readily available.  It would've been nice if they replaced it with something less common, that isn't on dinner tables every week.  Salmon was nicely done, well seasoned.  Pork Tenderloin was nicely cooked as well, very tender, & not dry at all.

In between the Apps & Entrées, they served a Lemon Sorbet to cleanse the palate and I thought that was a nice touch!

Setting is dim and quite romantic.  There was a Wine menu, primarily by the bottle, but no mixed drinks on there.  Wished there was a bit more selection on the By Glass section.  Reason why Tu Casa isn't getting a 4*s was that the service was forgettable.  Man server wasn't terribly friendly, Female who served the plates/added black pepper was a tad friendlier.

Food is good, but despite nice atmosphere, it was forgettable experience for some reason."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than five stars.  Really, I do.  The food and service I had last night was just that good.  We made a reservation for my 23rd birthday and I have no doubt we'll be back for other family dinners in the future.

When we arrived, our coats were immediately taken and we were welcomed like family.  Our waitress was fabulous, friendly and so attentive.  The menu is extensive, but not so big that the food suffers.  We were given complimentary champagne with berries for toasting.

I had the ahi tuna tartar to start, which was just delicious.  Perfectly sized portion, well seasoned, and just melts in your mouth.  My mum has the caprese salad, which had one of the nicest vinaigrettes I've ever tasted.  Dad had the escargot, which was well presented and delicious.  

As for our main courses, dad had the duck two ways, which was moist and delicious, with a strong apple flavour.  Mum had the linguine pescatore, which had tons of seafood(no skimping here!) and some of the biggest mussels and tastiest scallops I'd ever seen.  I had the pasta special, fettucini with veal, white wine sauce, peppers, and butternut squash.  Pasta was cooked perfectly across the board, everything was well seasoned, and food arrived quickly.

Neighbours who were also dining stopped by the table to wish me a happy birthday(we live across the street) and our waitress must have overheard, because she brought out a delicious sorbet dessert for us all and sang for me, assuring my parents that she had just overheard and wanted to surprise me.  Really sweet of her to do, and a nice gesture that didn't go unnoticed.

Make no mistake, it was a pricey night out, but in the long run it was worth it in abundance.  Food was nothing short of magnificent, well presented and the service was impeccable.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying our server Tom was absolutely fantastic. He was very attentive to our needs and was great wit our daughter.
We sat in the Charles room and really enjoyed it.
As for the food, it was fantastic. Meat was cooked to order. I had the bone in fillet mignon with potatoes and veggies with a Caesar salad for a starter. The only thing I would have liked is if the salad was a little more creamy (but I did enjoy it).
For dessert I had the chocolate moose which was delightful.  
Overall a wonderful experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Tu Casa is a fancy, fine dining place perfect for a date night. Despite their mediterranean label, expect more European, less Greek or Middle Eastern dishes. I felt under-dressed when waiters in nice suits greeted us, took our coats and brought us our food. The wait staff are very professional. Their wine list is pretty extensive. Complimentary bread and jelly (sorbet?) were tasty. My 6 oz filet tenderloin was cooked perfectly. It was sort of similar in shape to a baseball cut steak; nonetheless, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and their menu has changed and prices have increased substantially. After two glasses of wine and lunch, the bill with tip came to $65.00. Not a great place for a casual lunch. Way overpriced for what you get. Have been there many times, but will not go back."}
{"text":"Awesome appetizers. Quail with wild blueberries  is superb. Service was not quick, but we were not in a rush at all (maybe that's why they were not quick though). Good wine choices, although we did not drink."}
{"text":"Very nice place for a date night. Classy environment. The waiters were better dressed than we were. The prices are reasonable though and they have a number of entrées in the $20s. The complimentary bread was great and so was the complimentary jelly/sorbet after that. My wife's beef tenderloin was very, very delicious and so was everything else on that plate. My duck confit was also good and the butternut squash with it was so yummy too. The only dish I would pass on next time is the Caesar salad which was pretty typical. Service was pleasant and not pushy."}
{"text":"We went here for a get away dinner from the kids -  it was a great experience.  They have a great wine list, very attentive servers and most importantly,  the food was great!  We will be heading back there at a future date.  While it is off the beaten path... It is worth the journey!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

Their menu is very simple. One page of appetizers and one page of mains. I really liked the duck confit I ordered and the scallop order my friend ordered. Just the right amount of sides to the main piece in the dish. 

The place is also very cozy and small so it's good for a small gathering if you want some privacy as well. The restaurant is situated in a quiet neighborhood within the Lorne park area of Mississauga so it does take some time to finding this restaurant. 

The only thing that you should be aware of is the service may be slower than what you experience at other restaurants so you have to be patient. We ordered a main and a dessert and both took quite some time to make even though the restaurant was not busy at that time. 

LAST TIP??

If you're lucky to be celebrating your birthday on the day you dine at this restaurant, you can get a free dessert on the house! The portion size of the main is pretty big already so you don't need an appetizer on top necessarily."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has superb food and service. A very enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Good meal but some elements need improvement.

For a fine dining restaurant it still needs improvement to match the price they charge. Im comparing to other fine dining restaurants like George, Auberge and Scaramouche. 

Food
The entres were delicious. The lamb and fillet tenderloin were perfectly cooked. The lobster bisque was tasteless. Needs a lot more salt and flavor. Dont order the bisque. Ahi tuna was yummy and the tuna rolls were creative. The dessert was just okay. Creme brulee surface was not crackling but rather a barely there icing. Tiramisu was just alright. 

Service
We waited for 15 minutes and called over a waiter so we could place an order. The restaurant was not full yet but our waitress just didnt pay attention nor checked on us. They offered only flat or sparkling water. We asked for flat water and was not given an option for tap water. Other fine dining places always give tap water as an option. I can spend 500 bux on a meal (Kaji, momofuko shoto) and not mind but spending on water in Canada is ridiculous. Also ordered fillet tenderloin for 38 bux and was charged 3 dollars for the red wine jus that comes with the meal in which I did not request specifically for. This is a sketchy tactic. Why not just list the fillet tenderloin as 41 on the menu. 

Atmosphere
Odd layout. Not as much privacy as I would enjoy for fine dining. Very dark as all the windows were closed and lights were depressing. 

Overall it was just okay. Nothing to remember by."}
