{"text":"Eh, just sort of okay. It's actually in a food court in a sort of shopping centre (that I didn't even know existed) and I may not have gone with it had I known this before the fact but I was quite hungry and craving a dosa, so I gave it a whirl.  First off, the price is about the same ($8.99) for a coriander masala dosa as it is in other places (i.e. have a sit down option and should have more overhead) which would have been okay if the dosa itself was outstanding but it really wasn't. Average flavour and consistency and it didn't really fill me up for whatever reason. Also the chutneys that accompanied it (also a coriander and a coconut) were pretty bad and they sort of tasted as though they'd been sitting out all day, which is actually quite likely. The sambar was also not fantastic and it was probably about half the portion that I get at other places.  So I don't think I'd recommend. Service was quite friendly but for the same price there are places that make tastier dosas and actually give you more for your buck. This was food court quality for the same as I pay to get take out at a restaurant. But it did come with a free can of Coke! So that's something, right?"}
{"text":"Save your appetite for something else. I generally eat healthy during weekdays, but I was in the mall for taxes and got thirsty.  I saw these guys had Falooda which would have made a perfect cold/dessert drink. I could see all the dirty dishes inside the kitchen and just generally looked disgusting. Looked around to my left and there were huge boxes of Grocery Store Pani Puri; No seriously, why would i not have the pani puri from the grocery store if thats what you're going to sell?  Anyways, Falooda came, I had a sip and the guilt dawned on me that I have wasted my sugar intake for the day on this drink :(  A huge shot of sugar at the bottom (Red liquid), a lot noodles and soft serve which was basically cream, and milk which had thickness of water; Falooda is not supposed to be this watery. It felt like I was just drinking sugar water.  To make it worse, IT WAS $7!! They also take extra money if you pay by credit/debit for less than a 10$."}
{"text":"Worst food ever, I have had eaten in my life. We ordered the food from Skip the dishes for dinner. First of all, paranths were so hard and not fresh. Dosa was extremely SPICY. I love spicy food but the dosa was intentionally made EXTREMELY SPICY. we could not eat more than 2-3 bites. I had to make some quick food for our dinner. This ruined our special day. DO NOT WASTE your time and money."}
