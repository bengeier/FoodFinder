{"text":"I've really owed this review to Eagles Buffet for a while now.  For perspective, I've done the usual buffet/brunch rounds in the Valley (Biltmore, Phoenician, Camelback Inn, etc...).  So, I get it, it's a casino buffet - nevertheless,  a couple consistent points merit the five star rating for Eagles:

1) Creativity: You can tell they're always trying little twists without compromising quality - their fish dishes on Friday are always pretty creative and tasty and I personally don't really like fish very much!  The variety and tasteful preparation is very refreshing.  

2) Attitude: This is key - you can ask the buffet staff about the foods, and they are actually interested in talking about them and providing details.  You can tell they're into what they're doing - it really lends positively to the experience.  The wait staff is also very attentive.

Caveats:

I really only show up for the weekend dinner/brunch options - I'm not into crab legs (battling little crustaceans isn't my thing) which is apparently an option for weekdays.

No, it's not Vegas class endless food options scenario, we are in Arizona - however, if you're looking for that, maybe Talking Stick brings you a stitch closer - but just a stitch and I guess a couple of miles closer to Nevada so..."}
{"text":"Sunday Free-Flow Champagne brunch. Made to order omelette station, prime rib and roast pork carving station, fresh oysters, french toast, waffles, pancakes... $19 tax included. What's not too love? Don't forget to tip your servers."}
{"text":"We went for Thanksgiving yesterday and the food was pretty good. The selection was smaller than I expected, but there was enough to keep me and my company satisfied. The desert bar was limited. The wait staff was very friendly. I would welcome this place for lunch where it is more affordable, since the Thanksgiving price was about 25 bucks. 

Overall, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Went to Eagles for Christmas Dinner. Fair 35 minute wait in line (we were firmly told on the phone there were NO reservations). Food was good, and constantly refreshed. Our waitress was kind and kept refilling drinks. Many of the desserts our 5 person party tried were good. CONS: Be prepared for crowds in the casino, bathrooms, and when getting food. Smoking is allowed in this casino, and many take advantage. Ice Tea was basically coloured water... barely a taste. The buffet is technically open until 9, but staff began consolidating and cleaning up around 8pm when we left. Don't know if more food was put out later, but be wary if looking for a late dinner, as faves might already be gone. Finally, any food allergies and/or sensitivities are difficult to manage, as no ingredient lists were available."}
{"text":"I have been going to the crab buffet for years and have always been happy until now. My mom was in town for my birthday and we decided to celebrate by going to get crab. While we were waiting in the line to get he crab I commented to my mother that the crab looked different than normal. When we got back to our table and tried it it was the WORST crab I've ever had. I tried a few clusters to make sure it wasn't a fluke. It was super watery, hard to get to and a lot of the segments were empty. All we could get was broken up soggy mush. Normally I get nice big whole pieces out. I was so disappointed that I asked someone who looked like a supervisor or manager and they said that they have gotten many complaints and that they tried it themselves and it was awful. I asked how long they would have this horrible crab so that I wouldn't come back until it was gone and she explained that they buy 10,000 lbs at a time and it will lay 3-4 months. It just amazes me that they still charge the same price for such poor quality crab. I warned all of my friends not to go for a while. I will definitely return when the crab gets back to normal, but for now I'll go to the grocery store and make it at home."}
{"text":"Very small mediocre selection of below average food. Came on all you can eat crab legs night and could only eat a few. Although it was quite crowded, the line outside apparently didnt get the word that the crab legs were too salty and VERY soggy. Dessert selection is sparsely populated with tiny, pre-made selections that you would be better off to pass on. Our server was all but non-existent and tended to hover around the silverware station rearraging stacks of napkins while we were trying to get her attention by waving our salt-water soaked hands in the air. Maybe it was crowded because seafood is a scarce commodity in the desert. Do yourself a favor and pick up some crab legs at costco and enjoy them at home."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in the Friday night seafood buffet.  It used to be one of my favorite places to go because they used to have oysters on the half shell.  I always thought it was expensive but the oysters made it worth while.  The food choices have really gone downhill but the cost is still high and not worth what you get.  I was there on February 5th and only had a couple of items that fit on a small saucer.  I am not a picky eater and couldn't find anything that appealed to me.  I was going to ask for my money back, I'm really sorry that I didn't. Where did the oysters go???????/"}
{"text":"My favorite time to eat here is when they have the all-you-can-eat snow crab. Never had a bad meal. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"They aren't kidding, the selection is not that large, and it is rather pricey. But we went on crab night and we got our monies worth! The crab was plentiful, cooked perfectly and nice and thick! I wouldn't suggest this place if you aren't going for the crab. If you are, this is the place!!!! We love crab and will definitely go back soon! The line was SUPER long and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"So, to add insult to injury, a representative of Eagles Buffet asked me to private message them with my email address and telephone number.  I did... that was over 6 months ago!  Still haven't hear anything from them so not sure why they asked me for my email and telephone number.  In the interest of full disclosure, there was a typo in my phone number that I corrected 2 weeks ago; however, my email address was correct.  So add horrible customer service to horrible food!!!!  Before I would never return to their buffet but now I will never return to their casino either... period."}
{"text":"After a rather long absence, we decided to pay the buffet a visit Thanksgiving evening, where their menu was supposed to be \"special\" on the occasion of the holiday.  

We stopped coming here a while back, because, frankly, the arrival of the Great Recession of George Bush and His Banker Buddies led to a gradual --- but very noticeable --- decline in the quality of the buffet's food (the ultimate insult being taco Tuesday, an overpriced version of why I don't \"quiero Taco Bell\").  The improvement in the economy is reflected in the buffet's selection.  True, it was a different menu than usual; but even the usual daily offerings were better prepared; the chefs were cutting larger pieces of prime rib than in the past, when they were obviously instructed to not give more than a certain amount unless asked; and the selection was quite good -- both in variety and taste.  The only disappointment would be their desserts, which have always been a bit on the less-than-stellar side of the equation; but even there, it was hit and miss as to what you might enjoy.

If you can control your portion intake -- or don't care -- and don't mind multi-day bloating and higher sugar readings because of your several trips to the \"bad\" food you shouldn't be eating in the first place, then you will do quite well coming here; especially on days when the menu is unique.

Apparently, they now have all-you-can-eat sashimi and sushi during the weekdays for lunch at a very reasonable $14.99 per person, which I'm going to have to try in the near future; waistline be damned!

All in all, Eagles Buffet is once more becoming the place it once formerly was and I no doubt expect to see more and more patrons rolling out the doors on their way to buy stretch pants and a larger supply of insulin after their meals.  Who would've guessed a simple buffet could do so much to contribute to the growth of clothes stores for larger sized people and bring about an increase in the number of cardiologists in the Valley?"}
{"text":"For buffet this was good! We had sushi and Mexican on a Tuesday night. Not a big crowd and everything kept getting refilled as we ate.
We would come again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night.  This place has gone way down in quality and variety.  It was not a good experience at all.  The menu options were very limited and the taste and quality of the food was poor.  We felt like they took our money for something that was only worth half the cost of the dinner.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I am very very disappointed in their \"sushi bar\". I walked in all excited to have sushi and their famous sushi consisted of two different kinds of fish. And the second kind took me persuading to actually have him make it for me. The rest of the food was really good! But I came for sushi, Monday and Tuesday is sushi night supposedly here. But there is no sushi here do not come for Monday and Tuesday sushi night! On a bright note, the Mac and cheese was incredible."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night. All you can eat Crab night!
The trick is we got there early, 5:00pm. 
Because, when we left the line was about 100 people deep.
The Crab legs were divine and so was the Prime Rib. Everything was fresh and hot, and our Server Rose was very attentive. They were restocking the Desserts all the time from a lovely little trolley they bring out. (see Photo) .
The head chef here is great, every time we come out to dine we always see him checking on everything in the food area. Making sure every thing is clean , the proper temp. and aesthetically pleasing as well.
 I love going here."}
{"text":"Ooooooweee!!!  Ladies and gents let me tell you my experience here.  Im writing a review while I'm yumming away, so I'll  keep this short and sweet.  Monday- Friday they are open 11a-3p and serve international cuisines.  I would rate this 8/10. Talk about quality versus quantity, I assure you this place wins quality.  Customer service would make it in my book to where it's not overwhelming and awkward. Overall experience for me with this place is 8/10. I'd definitely come back over and over again."}
{"text":"It is okay. Nice and clean, variety is a little less than what I expect of a casino, which is why I give it a lower rating. I prefer Wandering Horse buffet at talking stick resort. They have twice as many options."}
{"text":"Amazing.Service is top notch.Food variety is excellent.Shrimp, ravioli, ham, roast beef, eggs benedict.You name it, it is probably there. The service was good, refilling drinks and taking away plates. A must for the perfect Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I've been in the Valley for 4 years and have yet to find or try this place.  No, I have not been living under a rock but where in the heck have I been.  Marylanders love seafood buffets, especially seafood buffets with all you can eat crabs or crab legs.  Love them!  I'll start by saying you really get your bang for your buck.  $24 bucks (including my drink) is what I paid for about 2 hours of none stop cracking and finger licking.  I went for a GNO (Girls Night Out) on a Wednesday.  It was pretty crowded and a constant flow of people.  There were so many dinner items on the menu, I tried my best to try a little piece of everything.  I wish I had taken pictures.  I'm assuming the menu changes because the menu isn't listed on the website.  

When I dined there last week (February 21st) the following items were on the menu:

A nice salad bar with Spinach, Cesar Salad, Potato Salad and a Macaroni Salad with all the fixings (Cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, peas, carrots, red beets, crotons, chopped boiled eggs and many different types of dressings.
Hand Carved Ham and NY Strip Steak, fried chicken, fried fish, baked cod, sirloin steaks, grilled asparagus, sweet buttered corn, mashed potatoes with or without gravy, mac and cheese, a few Chinese cuisine items, a taco/nacho bar, and more desserts than I care to remember 
I enjoyed 2 servings of fried chicken, NY Strip steak, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  I also had 2 servings of crab legs.  

The Crab Legs are served 3 to a plate, steamed, without seasoning.  That's important to note because you MUST add Old Bay and melted butter to the Crab Legs, without it, they're just Blah. On my second go 'round of Crab Legs I heard the guy in front of me ask for double the amount of crab legs on one plate.  It was impossible because they're so big but the server just came him 2 plate/2 servings.  So you can definitely ask for more Crab Legs in one serving if you like.  Lastly, the Crab Leg buffet is Wednesday AND Thursday evenings, same price, same time."}
{"text":"It was our first time to Scottsdale and somebody suggested this place.  The dim sum included in the lunch buffet was top notch, the service 3/4 visits was terrific, the last day we had a different server who was good just not amazing like the previous 3 lunches.    The salads were also excellent.  $10 with drink included was the deal of the century!"}
{"text":"I went there on last Saturday, the food was so good but the varieties of the food wasn't that much. It cost me 24 something for dinner. The services was good. Most of The oysters was fresh but not all of it."}
{"text":"First time here. Came for the AYCE Crab Legs. They were wonderful of course, so was the fried chicken & the roasted potatoes were delicious. The salad bar was fresh, lots of flavorful choices there. Very impressed by the desserts, many choices & lots of small tasting size items. Even the smallest items showed great attention to detail & taste - every one I tried was amazing."}
{"text":"Went for family celebration of St. Patrick's Day. There was an exceptional selection of brunch options including healthy choices, delicious pecan rolls and desserts for those inclined.  Our service was quite good. Really enjoyed a delicious meal and would recommend EB as one of the more reasonably priced brunch offerings out there."}
{"text":"Apart from the crab day, their menu list is great but the taste and quality is not. It is a reasonable price for unlimited crab legs, service is good and place is clean. The times I have gone there, there are always plenty of people for dinner time, and they are pretty quick with sitting their customers down."}
{"text":"This review is for the all-you-can-eat crab legs buffet. Crab legs looked delicious but were incredibly soggy. There was literally a puddle on our table from the excess water that our server had to soak up with a towel! The other items on the buffet looked so-so. Not a lot of turnover on those dishes because everyone was there for crab. The deserts were nasty and warm, when some should have been refrigerated. We waited in line an hour to get in. I guess you get what you pay for. Giving 2 stars solely on pricing."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN, this is the best crab leg buffet in the Phoenix metro area. Unfortunately, it is only available on Wednesday's and Thursday's between 4:30-10pm. Its 17.50+ tax and that includes your drink. You can even request an additional coffee at the end of the meal with your dessert. Admittedly, this isn't a $9.99 dinner price but the crab never runs out and you are served generous portions. 2-3 big clusters at a time, like 8-12 legs. The rest of the buffet is just OK, the hot wings were pretty good and the beef selection (I think it was prime rib) was a tasty break from the crab. On the other hand, the desserts are great! The desserts are awesome with lost of little one potion custard-type and ultra rich selections. The restaurant is nicely decorated with dim lighting and lots of light wood finishes. It seats quite a few but it doesn't seem loud. So, go there for the crab and finish it off with a couple nice small desserts."}
{"text":"I came on an all-you-can-eat crab legs night. I have to say the crab leg portions are extremely generous. The quality of the crab is good too. The buffet also had other main dishes like roast turkey breast and prime rib. Didn't try the turkey but the prime rib was pretty good. 

Skip the soup- nothing to write home about. The desserts were pretty good and artfully arranged. All in all, it was worth the $25 price tag for the crab alone."}
{"text":"This wasn't an impressive buffet even for the price of ten bucks at lunch. Granted, they were carving a few meats, but none of them I personally liked. The rest of the buffet was pretty much amateur hour. The highlight was the chicken enchilada's and maybe the grilled cheese sandwiches and mexican rice. They had a weird dim sum area, but it looked like unless you were asian, you would have no clue how to order and a large tip jar also deterred me (sorry, I already payed). The soups were average and it's time to get rid of baked Potato bars around the country already. The dessert area was looking quite old, but if you must try the creme brulee cups. Average food for a good price."}
{"text":"If you're on the fence about going here for dinner, just do it. A friend and I decided to check it out on a rainy Friday night. There was only one couple ahead of us in line we were promptly seated. The buffet itself is a lot smaller than any casino buffet I've been to before and I didn't find a lot of food that appealed to me :(  However, the things I did choose were all pretty good tasting. If you're a dessert fan, you're in luck. I actually think the amount of dessert selections is the same as non-dessert selections.  They have cakes, cookies, tarts, drumsticks & individually wrapped ice creams among other sweet treats. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, until she assumed we were done eating and thought we were trying to leave without paying our cocktail bill. It was awkward. We felt like criminals and fat asses at the same time. She told us it happens a lot and she couldn't afford to pay our tab. We laughed it off, but still it was slightly offensive. That is why I gave 3 instead of 4 stars. Speaking of cocktails, they offer happy hour with $2 bottles and I swear she said wine was $2 but it was more like $4 AND its served warm. She couldn't take the wine back but brought me a glass of ice. Nothing like ice watered down cheap wine. For $20.50 I'd do it again."}
{"text":"The review is about WEEKDAY LUNCH buffet......
Great food always fresh and very clean good verity 
I love their dessert verity as well GOOD things !
Very fair price .... Way better than any other buffet in the area"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but because I've always tried the 4 and 5 star buffets in Vegas, I was off-standish about trying this on out. The ones in Vegas always seemed spectacular, and I didn't think Eagles was going to be able to beat my expectations. 

Since my husband's company was paying for it, we tried it for his work party event, and another time for just a company hangout event.

I'll admit it, it was really, really good.. they had a large salad bar, pastas, seafood selection, and good choice of Asian, American, and Italian selections. They also had a fruit and dessert bar. I loved the unlimited crab legs and drawn butter! I never leave here hungry or disatistfied. Service is very prompt and they come by often to check up on you.The casino that it sits in is kind of small, but the buffet is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Dim sum Monday-Friday as part of the buffet! I believe it is $12.95 per person for lunch. Lots to pick from to eat! Also yummy desserts such as the root beer float. The service could be a little better, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I like the lunch here with Dim Sum go with it and only $10.00 dollars per person, just only every Thursday during a week, I love the food here very much everything!"}
{"text":"I don't even try going on crab night (Wed-Thu) anymore as the wait is always way too long. I think the shortest I had to wait in line was 2.5 hours. However, prime rib night (Fri-Sat) is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Went for the Champagne Brunch for my Birthday weekend. I love a breakfast buffet.
It had a lot of shrimp which I love. An Omlete bar made to order - nice. But mostly lunch food is available.  Oh some peach french toast that was very good, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs and eggs  benidict.  Mini Bagels were cold and of poor quality. They really should replace those. Lox was suppose to be there but it was just salmon.  Surprisingly the champagne was good when pared with the food! I seldom like the taste of champagne so I was happy to find that I liked this one.  The dessert bar was not so impressive. Always the same. They should do a chocolate fountain or something impressive. Maybe even add an ice sculpture.  

Upgrade things for the price of $17.50 plus tip.  Because Golden Corral has a chocolate fountain and ice cream varities for less than $10 for brunch.  

Of course some of the resorts do the chocolate fountain also. I called and found one resort that offered Sunday Champagne Brunch with fresh pastries also but the price was $70 per adult. A bit out of my range.

I would go back just the same but not very often.  It was better than the lunch buffet I once went to here."}
{"text":"Good variety and value. We like the Crab leg special but anytime is good visit."}
{"text":"This place is quantity over quality. I came for a weekday lunch and for $10, the food was just \"meh.\" I would not let this be your introduction to dim sum, because those dishes are not very good. You can get a real dim sum lunch elsewhere for comparable pricing.  Eagles is an option if you want a variety of mediocre food. To be honest, nothing really stood out for me. My friend randomly threw some cash into a slot machine and won enough to cover our meals. That was good because i wouldn't pay to come back. Service though, was pretty good. Our plates were cleared and drinks kept full."}
{"text":"food was good. then I bit into a piece of steel wire about an inch long that was nested inside my coconut cream pie! Lookes like part of a wire brush perhaps? Passed it on to the Eagles Buffet manager. He did not seem too concerned. Said \"sorry\" and walked away."}
{"text":"So it has been a year since my last review of this Buffet.
We came again on a Sunday. Very nice as always.
Food is great, some things I love ,& some things just OK.
That is why a Buffet is a great place to go. You can try things and not feel bad if you do not like them.
Still a good price at $38.00 for two. Even Champange with the Sunday Bruch. I did not partake, but if you wanted to.
Even the GM came by and asked if we liked it and Thanked us for coming in.
 Lots of parking in the lot as well. Nice clean rest rooms."}
{"text":"Tuesday is the international buffet. Eagle buffet offers great dim sum (in a buffet perspective). The employees are so nice. My waiter is awesome and friendly. I feel bad for the 90ish senior who still had to work. He worked in the dessert area. Is there like a tip option for staff who works at those areas? I came to support because the director of the casino was there and if no one comes to the dessert asking him for help with scooping ice cream, etc. that would seem bad. 
Now, let begin with describing the food. I'm not a buffet type because I don't like the feeling of having to eat my money worth of food. There are strange food and I'm very adventurous when it comes to eating (not sweat-pouring activities). Anyway, I still haven't started describing the food yet. I ate this weird mashed sweet potato (with marshmallow). I wasn't sure if that was a dessert or but they put it next to the fish so no. To me it's not weird but to many non Asians may be, they offer chicken feet, beef tripes, etc.
The chicken feet didn't taste as flavorful as the actual dim sum place. But seriously, it is a freaking $11 dim sum (if you get gold membership, you get 10% off). I can't complain to an $11 dim sum when I barely tried out all the food. I was super full already. Did I mention they have Pho too? That Vietnamese delicacy is a must when you visit. I didn't try it because I have Pho too many times because all my non-Asian roommates like Pho very much and always asked me to eat with them since they have no power to cook Pho the way Vietnamese people do; I'd say yes every time. 
Their dessert selections are huge. For an affordable buffet like this, I rate these desserts a 10/10. I like creme brulee so I'm bias toward it."}
{"text":"The Friday night seafood buffet is excellent if you love seafood. It would of course be better if there were crab legs which are usually found at other seafood buffets. The buffet during the week is average but less expensive. I would recommend the Friday buffet if you are a seafood love."}
{"text":"It is  a buffet on a very small scale. Sitting in the furthest table from the entrance to get away from ultra smoke filled casino. They have a shuttle from parking areas with a tip cup. Very limited handicap parking. The food is average at best . The selection is small and unexciting. You have to get lucky to find an item you settle for. Went sat around 5pm no crowd.Prime rip special full of 70% fat. What's edible is good not great. The sliced pork roast chewed like rubber. The one sweedsh meatball with polenta corn bread was the highlight of dinner. 7 out of ten. The fried chicken breast was 8 1/2 and I don't like fried chicken but not much else that looked appealing. Friendly server friendly cooks just worth about a $12 dinner with take what we got or tougher luck $21 plus tax per person for no selection is a no brainer. One and done. Pay the extra $15 and so to their sister hotel talking stick and the buffet and crab legs are excellent and no smoke what so ever. Forgot the deserts. Vanilla ice cream machine terrible ice creams. Cookies look good tastes them all yech yuck and double yech! Just terribly made cookies. I wouldn't go back with a free dinner buffet for life coupon nor would I recommend it too my enemies. They need a total overhaul of the buffet and the selections and the small size of the food displays. Rate them 1 star. The best was average the worst gets one bite and garbage. Sorry the worst reviews are 100% accurate. If you aren't used to eating good food on a daily basis then the reviews that praise this place dont know any better. Here you definitely don't get what you pay for. !!!! If your thinking of trying it better off getting some pizzas at Walmart. They give you 6 choices. A WALMART buffet would top this place hands down"}
{"text":"WTF!!!  As you know, I like this place a lot!  For its food.  But they never post their menu on their website and when you call, nobody knows what's on the menu for the day.  How stupid is that.  So I called again today and they put me thru to their Food And Beverage Department and they picked up the phone and hung up on me.  I know this for a fact because I called back 3 times and each time the operator connected me to F&B, this happened.  How freaking stupid and inconsiderate is that?

Perhaps we should not frequent this place again."}
{"text":"Oh man this place was delicious i want to go back again. I went yesterday night with my bf and it's  $20 for dinner which was cheap because I've spent more at casino buffets. The food was amazing, it was seafood night which is what i wanted! The fish was pretty good for az seafood. The smoked salmon was the best the also had clams shrim and fried seafood. Other than the seafood, the other food that was there was fresh and amazing! Best dessert at a buffet I've ever had! The area was clean and the staff was nice too. Im not a big casino arizona fan but this place was worth it."}
{"text":"I had another fabulous lunch at the Eagles Buffet today.  I really enjoy the variety of selections here, I don't believe that it's ever been the same in all the times I've tried it.  For those of us who \"try\" to be more health conscious, you just cannot go wrong with two salad bars.  Today, the entrees and side dishes were more along the lines of comfort food and included the following:

BBQ Beef Brisket w/ Buns
Cornmeal encrusted Trout/Sauteed Red Snapper
Roasted Chicken & Pork
Pepperoni Pizza
Mashed potatoes/gravy
Roasted Red Potatoes
Macaroni & Cheese
Baked Beans
Sauteed green beans w/ red/green pepper and onion
Jasmine rice w/ black beans and peppers (delicious)
Clam chowder/Chicken & bean soup
Black Bean & Chipotle prepared salad
Baked potates w/ all the toppings

The service is always top notch and I just love the dark, cozy atmosphere, it almost reminds me of a steakhouse.  The desserts are just \"to die for\" here....I had the freshly baked apple and cranberry cobler and my dining companion had this super rich, ultra scrumptious chocoloate peanut butter pie.  We both rolled ourselves out of there and are having no dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Ayce crab was okay.  Smallish buffet.  Desserts either had a strange texture or were too sweet and the cheese cake tasted really salty to me."}
{"text":"I so badly wanted to like this place, and I understand why they believe a casino buffet should be 20 dollars, but... Dang!  If you're gonna ask so much $, please put some thought into your menu and food quality!

The variety was VERY small, and I was surprised that the fish (and a few other dishes) were overcooked and tough. 

Also, the desserts were truly awful.  Everything they had (which was extremely limited) tasted like it had been sitting uncovered on a counter for at least 24 hrs.  Dry edges, as if cake slices were cut a few days before, were consistently present, and overall, there was very little taste.  In all honesty, it tasted on par with most mid-level Chinese buffets' desserts where you can't help but look around for the piles of Styrofoam Packing Peanuts you know must be somewhere which came along with the desserts. 

Wow...  It wasn't good. At all."}
{"text":"I had gone back and forth on this one, trying to decide between here and the buffet at the Talking Stick resort. This one wasn't awful, but I'm definitely going to try the Wandering Horse before coming back here.

So I'm a vegetarian. I made this clear when I called. Yes, they had the options. I made this clear when we stood in line to be seated. Yes, very veggie friendly, and the chefs would even make me something special.

I got in. It was fish night  (yay for my partner, boo for me). By \"vegetarian options\" they meant that there was a meager salad bar, a cheese platter, and hush puppies. Even their bleu cheese casserole had ham of some sort in it, and all the pizza had meat on it. Fine - I went to ask the chefs if they'd make me something. They all stared at me blankly, and passed me from chef to chef. Finally, one guy said he could do it, and asked me what I wanted. Obviously, I didn't know what they could make, so I asked. \"Stir fry vegetables.\" Ok, anything else? \"Stir fry vegetables.\" I asked if they had some protein lying around, and he finally found silken tofu...which isn't meant to be stir fried, but I took it.

I waited while he made it. Basically, tofu, veggies and soy sauce, with nothing else to spice it up. Also, they didn't have any other non-fish specific sauces, so I couldn't spice it up. I ate a lot of salad and cheese and stir fry.

My partner loved some of the fish dishes, but said others were very dried. She didn't finish the carved meat, but went back for more trout and potatoes.

I was super excited about the dessert bar, and their dulche de leches in individual bowls (similar to creme brulee) were out of this world. I had two, contemplated a third. German chocolate cake, also tasty. The rest that we tried? Meh.

Service was great, outstanding. However, the buffet was much smaller than I had anticipated (about the same size as Super Salad at 4 times the cost), food (meat  like) was mediocre, and the whole place was not veggie friendly at all. Three stars unless something magical happens."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to try their new sushi buffet which is on Mondays and Tuesdays. I have to say I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the food.

They had their regular spread of food such as salads, meats, sides and other arrangements. The sushi section had about 5 different types of rolls. The salmon roll was the best out of all them which was nice and fresh. The other rolls such as the philly roll and shrimp roll were extremely dry, small and just disappointing.

I mainly filled up on a potato, fried fish and the desserts.

The desserts were delicious but it doesn't warrant the $16 dollar price. The place was pretty empty and honestly I can say it's probably because this place is missing the wow factor that some buffets have.

Skip this place and go have a nice meal somewhere else."}
{"text":"We go there for Christmas dinner but any Sunday is just as nice. Try to arrive by 11:00 AM or you could be in line for over an hour. Prime rib, oysters on the half shell, shrimp, salmon, roast pork plus all the side dishes, mashed potato's, and the dessert bar and key lime pie is just fantastic. This is a 5 star establishment and the servers are very attentive and really take care of you, be sure and leave a nice tip. Just walk past the slot machines going in and out."}
{"text":"Customer service throughout the restaurant is great. I love the food. The salmon was perfectly seasoned, the ribs fell off the bone, mashed potatoes are homemade and the brown gravy is to die for. Thumbs up to this place."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets in terms of value. They have crab legs on Weds and Thurs for $18.50 a person. I think the crab legs are fine and you can get Old Bay seasoning to mix with your butter. They usually have a carving station with two types of meat. Today they also had fried chicken which was fried perfect and very moist.  The service has been consistently good over the six times that I have eaten here. Every time has been a good experience. The dessert stations offer a variety of tasty treats including creme brulee."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  I wish there was a seperate entrance so you didn't have to walk through the nasty wall of smoke from the casino on your way to the restaurant.  Also, the smoke smell from the casino was so bad in the restaurant.  We almost left but were able to find a table in the far back corner by the kitchen where we weren't overwhelmed by the smoke.  I'm so surprised they didn't install some sort of air filter in the restaurant so you're not eating while surrounded by a wall of smoke.  

The buffet included peel and eat shrimp, oysters, carving stations, salad, fruit, all the breakfast goodies, omelette station etc.... 

The food is good but the overwhelming smoke smell was a huge issue for us."}
{"text":"My son was complaining that this place didn't have as many items as Wandering Horse. I had to explain to him that my wallet texted me and told me to take it easy on the cash outflow.

That's right, there are not a gazillion items on the menu, but here's what I tried. I had the prime rib and was not impressed. The flat iron steak was fabulous along with the mashed potatoes. The mixed vegetables with the broccoli was perfectly cooked. I really loved the Gumbo. I went back for several cups, even though the Calm Chowder looked so inviting. The seafood looked good but I was on a land lubber mission during this visit. The coconut cream pie was disappointing. The ice cream was good. One thing I liked was the water was good and didn't have that dog hair smell like the Wandering Horse Buffet. 

So for $20.95 per person I thought the price was fair and will return."}
{"text":"We ate at this buffet awhile back on a Thursday night for crab legs.  We got there at about 5:30 and didn't have to wait long.   The selection is a lot smaller than what I am used to at typical Vegas buffets however...the quality was excellent!  I like it better this way, sometimes I feel overwhelmed and like I need to try everything (which is impossible anyway).  The salads were delicious and the crab legs warm and amazing.  We had excellent service as well.  I loved the desserts!"}
{"text":"went here a couple months back. this is the first buffet that was not busy, meaning everyone was not scattered around filling their plates. instead everyone had to wait in a long line to get crab legs and the utensils/plates were not stocked. mind you there was still a lot of time before closing. plus most of the stations where empty, very few food options. I probably wont be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I ate here because they have all you can eat crab legs on Wednesday and Thursday. On a night like this I would expect a full house and line. The restaurant was busy but there was never a line. I like that I didn't have to fight the crowd to get some crab. They also had a salad bar, meat, fish, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, sweet and sour chicken, chow mein, tacos, hush puppies, and rolls. The crab legs and tri tip were great and the rest of the food was okay. We left completely satisfied and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Well, I went back to the Eagles Buffet last night for the crab legs. By far the worst crab legs I have ever gotten there. Completely water logged and barely any crab meat in them. The crab meat was very strange looking and did not taste very good. My boyfriend also thought the same thing. The mass amounts of butter I dipped the crab in didn't even make it taste better. I'm really disappointed in the quality of the buffet. It seems to be declining each time I go back. It's a shame that you pay 18.99 for all you can eat crab legs and the best thing you have is a salad and some mashed potatoes because the crab legs are inedible. 

Also, I was told in my previous review by a staff member that they would be following up with me on the other poor experience that I had. No one ever followed up with me."}
{"text":"We were in the Phoenix area over the holiday weekend and wanted some Chinese food.  We did a search on Yelp for Chinese Buffets and the Eagles Buffet came up.  The reviews were really good so we thought we would give it a try.  It was a little difficult to find because I followed the Yelp directions which took us a couple of miles out into the middle of nowhere.  So I had to enter the street address into Google Maps to find it.  Once we realized it was inside a casino, we didn't have any problems.
 
After we arrived and were seated, we discovered that this was not a Chinese buffet but a Sunday brunch buffet.  While my wife was initially disappointed not to get her Chinese fix, she wasn't disappointed for long.  They had anything and everything you would want on the buffet.  Breakfast offerings included eggs benedict, bacon, link sausage, hash browns, scrambled eggs, french toast, bananas foster, pancakes or omelets made to order.  There was grilled ham with pineapple, roast beef, green beans, potato wedges, baked halibut, steamed salmon, for those who preferred lunch.  Multiple salad options, cole slaw, fruit, caesar salads to spinach salad.  All kinds of bread, savory and sweet.  My favorite was the boiled shrimp and the fried shrimp.  The fried shrimp was excellent, light and crispy.  The boiled shrimp was a perfect match with the slightly spicy cocktail sauce.  The shrimp alone was enough to keep my wife and I satisfied, I filled up a half plate three times.  The grandkids found plenty of choices to choose from as well.  The granddaughter focused on breakfast, eating multiple links of sausage and pancakes.  Our grandson focused on lunch, with the grilled ham, assorted cheese cubes, spinach salad, and various breads.  While eating their meals, they were already talking about the desserts and what they wanted to try.  There was enough dessert options to please anyone, included sugar free selections.  I had two pieces of pie; the grandson had three dessert shooters and a chocolate ice cream cone.
 
I am not usually a fan of buffets because I often find the food unseasoned and bland, this was not the case at Eagles.  Everything was seasoned and flavorful.  It was more expensive than we would normally spend on a dinner meal, I can say everyone left with their bellies full and ready for a nap.  The servers were attentive and kept our dishes cleaned off the table while refilling our drinks.  I would not recommend this as an every Sunday meal but occasionnally this would be a very nice treat!"}
{"text":"The Eagle truly soars!  Amazing quality, service and variety blew us away.  I loved it that the odor of tobacco was practically nil!  We love sushi and they delivered, with extremely fresh and properly served seafood.  Tuesday nights are sushi nights at the Eagle and they did not disappoint.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers I stopped in the office and registered for their \"Players Card\".  All that was needed was my drivers license.  Showing this card to the buffet cashier got me a $4.20 discount for that little effort.  The sushi buffet dinner is $15.50 per person and well worth it. There were nigri with salmon, tuna, and 2 other fish, as well as octopus, 4 kinds of delectable sushi rolls, fresh fresh and perfectly cooked and seasoned enormous salmon fillet that was delectable!  I ate the most amazing fried cod, moist inside, crispy outside and hot right out of the deep fryer.  The pickled ginger slices were the best I've tasted in years.  Once we had consumed our delectables from the sea, we headed inland so to speak. I sampled their fried pork belly in bbq sauce - heavenly!  (I'm ashamed to admit it was the highlight of the entire evening for me!) Then a carved slice of roast pork loin which I smothered in brown gravy accompanied by whipped potatoes and freshly cooked green beans.  I skipped the cod vera-cruz and the lovely assortment of Mexican dishes and condiments, the succulent carved roast beef .  There were a myriad of more beautiful dishes calling out to me, with no more parking space in my stomach, sorry, I couldn't slip another new taste into the mix.  Two large dessert tables called out as well, loaded with brightly colored pasteries, pies, puddings, the makings of a soft freeze sunday.  I had to try some of them and discovered they were 3's and 4's rather than that food already consumed 5's!!!  Nothing could detract or subtract from the 5 star rating I awarded the Eagle.  There is NO WAY I will not return, and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet when you take into account it is only $16.  The brisket, turkey and pork baby back ribs were very good, especially with the multiple condiments they have sitting out.  Also to note, they have and interesting spicy mac & cheese..... The salad bar is very basic. They have several other items that I did not try, but looked equally good and fresh.

One real bummer, the sushi bar sucked, the sushi chef clearly should not be working with the public and is slow as a snail.  He has no imagination and the sushi bar has the most basic rolls possible, which were really not that good.  Service was top notch!  The managers help out the servers and did stop by my table to ask how it was going.

Every night they have some sort of up charge special.  I had the surf and turf for $10.  I actually changed it to surf and surf, two pretty decent sized lobster tails that are tasty.

All in all, pretty good, especially if you have kids......."}
{"text":"While this buffet isn't exactly Life In The Fast Lane, you will definitely get that Peaceful Easy Feeling after you've finished your meal. The food we had was all cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful, especially for the price. We definitely did Take It To The Limit. And if you must feel like a Desperado, they even have Keno screens at the ready. It's a great location as well, just a Long Run across the Seven Bridges Road (aka the 101) in SE Scottsdale. One Of These Nights, choose to have your meal here if you want to Take It Easy, whether or not you're staying at a Hotel California."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff! We went there for brunch and it wasn't expensive for a Las Vegas style buffet area on a more smaller scale.

Pork Belly is to die for! A 10
Roast Beef is a 8
Waffles is a 8

Overall other food an 8!

Great place! If you don't mind the smoke smell as you walk in lol!"}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet for one reason: every Wednesday and Thursday 4-930pm ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS! Woowww! So good! And their crab legs are served warmed and there's melted butter that you can get to go along with it! The crab legs are always so good and keeps coming! Their desserts are really good too! Many different kind of pastries and tart cups! The other foods are great too! I can't explain how good this place is and their customer service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The price is extremely good. I ate crablegs here a long time ago then forgot about it. The a couple weeks ago, I went to the wandering horse cuz I thought that where It was, the seafood was served cold, the other food was ok and the price was high for what they offered (about $35/person). Then I went to eagle buffet for just $19 for crab legs buffet. It was amazing, the food taste a lot better in general and the crab legs were great too. Can't wait to go there for Dim Sum soon, it's just $11 for lunch. I'm a cook btw, not someone who has no idea about tasting. No bias"}
{"text":"Okay so when I first put up this review I got an email from a lady named Stephanie saying that send me your email address and we promise to make this right or something to that effect I sent her my email address  that was 20 days ago I still haven't heard anything from her  so yeah . 


Omg where do I  start first off we saw all you can eat crab so we was in when I walked into the restaurant and to my table which was way in the back I smelled nothing but cigarette smoke eww so we decided to go join the line from where I stood I could see the selection was smaller then at my house in my kitchen so I politely asked for a refund and we left I wouldn't recommend this place to no one I wouldn't even take my worst enemy here wow but the staff is polite"}
{"text":"We came here for my sister's baby shower brunch and there was a lot left to be desired.  First,  they tried to charge us $250 to use the larger back room, which wasn't even a private space.  The price didn't bother me considering they were offering all you could drink mimosas but the service was downright bad. Everytime we ordered more mimosas the staff seemed to be really put out; essentially they like to advertise the all you can drink,  but they aren't happy About doing it. 

The food was just okay,  as others have mentioned, the selection was smaller than I expected.  I stuck mostly to salad,  fruit,  and soup, but I tried other selections and nothing was a wow. My friends did enjoy the cocktail shrimp and oysters.

Over the experience was okay because of the company I was with,  but I never plan to return."}
{"text":"My experience was regrettable. My friends and I decided to take part in their buffet for the all you can eat crab legs. While we were waiting to be seated, almost 5 minutes after we paid, we overheard one of the hostesses say seat them in the back with all the \"bad\" people. Everyone in my group were African American. I can only imagine why she concluded we were \"bad\". We are all in our late twenties and had just gotten off work and we're still in our business clothes. As you can understand, we quickly lost our appetites. We decided not to let one person's ignorance ruin our night so we stayed to dine. 

The food was average, the service was subpar, and the desserts were underwhelming. I will not be back there to eat ever again. Unless you're in the mood to be insulted and treated poorly I wouldn't recommend that you go either."}
{"text":"I'm not one to give reviews on what's good or bad at restaurants, I've been coming here for years and the food may not be up to par a fraction of the time but I still visit this place.  What I do know is that the staff is very hard working and extremely friendly and I am great-full for their effort to making my experience enjoyable, it's one of many great times that keeps me coming back again and again.  You know, I question sometimes about missing items and a few other foodies also mention something similar \"where's the fried chicken?\" \"where's the blueberry pie?\" Where's this? Where's that?  I live for your fried chicken, and I know that other patrons love them as well.  You know how I know?  Because it's always empty when you have it that night!!  
I love you guys and I love your regulars as well, it's always a good time when I visit and see the majority enjoying themselves.  Don't mind the negative reviews from the one, two star guest, that will not turn me away from the many many positive experiences I've taken in with every visit.
By far, the best of casino buffets in the state of AZ from pricing, cleanliness,  variety, staff and customers."}
{"text":"I came here for the seafood buffet. I was seated in a booth and went to go get food. As I come back someone else was sitting there. So, of course I was just dissatisfied with their service already. They then move me to a table. 5 min later they said they had a new booth for us. So, I'm just like ok at least they are trying to be nice about it. Only reason why I gave it the rating I did because no one likes to be moved 2-3 times. I'm just trying to eat here because it was already bad enough they gave my seat to someone else after they just sat me down 5 min. earlier. 

So, for the food part they had fish, pizza, wings, rice, prime rib, chicken, and of course crab. That is basically what I go there for is the crabs. It's good if you need a fix for it. Now, before this whole seating fiasco I thought this place was good on their customer service and the food was legit. I was just a bit disappointed with being moved a few times, but since they got good crab, I can see myself being back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Sunday evening and was very disappointed at first by two things: The price ($15.50) and the customer service. We were practically yelled at by one of the managers that we were in the wrong line as we walked up--at the time there was no one else in the line but us, so we did not understand why she became so angry. As we continued our meal the waiters were pretty much non existent and when they were around were very tight lipped and rude. The one bright light in all of this was the food was actually good--I had the chicken noodle soup, salmon, sweet/white fish, spinach salad (added onions and cucumbers), slice of pepperoni pizza, and two small desserts (red velvet cake). They had an awesome selection of desserts--I just wish that they had the same diverse selection in their dinner items especially for the price. I do not think that I will be returning to this buffet and I do not recommend it to anyone. For the price I think that you can do much better in variety and customer service."}
{"text":"Went at opening, no breakfast food.  
I got sick, so I think they use msg.
There were fried onion rings fried shrimp fried fish stick things, grilled cheese?  Basically the simplest defrosted food you could think of.  You could tell from that boxed freezer food type batter. 

They're good about clearing plates and refilling the water, but there was not a single food that I could say wow this is  really good! I think I want to go get more.

I mean really, not 1 single thing was appetizing . 

This is the place you would go to shovel food in your mouth without tasting it. :/"}
{"text":"Went there last night for crab legs buffet and the food was amazing and service was really good too. I will definitely come back and bring my family!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING great crab legs, clean and beautiful. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is right. Beware that on crab night there will be a long line. So get there early! But it is still worth the wait if you end up waiting. The Angry Crab, you get like 4 legs for the cost of market rate pricing for one pound of crab. Or for the same price you can get unlimited on crab night here.

{"text":"Met my whole family of 11 people here for brunch on a sunday. We got in pretty quick and were led to our table. As you can imagine, with so many people, someone wasn't happy with the choice of our table and so we ended up asking for a different one.
The staff was nice enough to accommodate that and finally we were seated. 
The buffet itself had a pretty good selection of breakfast items, including an omelette grill area, where you can pick the ingredients. In addition, the Sunday brunch includes seafood, and many other lunch type foods.  
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end."}
{"text":"Always loved this place, but very disappointed with the remodel. They put a huge island smack in the middle of the food area and now it is horrible gridlock if even one person with a walker is in there. We had to jockey for position and getting bumped into and nearly dropped my plate. It was exhausting just getting our food and it was all cold by the time we finally were able to get everything we wanted and get back to our table. Also they are using something now that appears to be ice tongs and you can't grip anything  properly with them and it falls on the floor or into the other selections before you can put it onto your plate and you have to fumble and fight with them. Everyone around me was grumbling about the changes being more trouble than they are worth. The sneeze guards are so deep someone who is short like me (5'2\") can't reach the food further back. It was especially. awful just trying to get a salad and there was salad items dropped all into the dressing thanks to the miserable thongs. If it's not broken don't fix it."}
{"text":"We had all you can eat sushi buffet today. We didn't expect much first but we realized they serve great sushi as buffet. They also have good variety of food and lovely desserts. It's great deal for that price. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This buffet is really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At first you will think,,,oh no,,,there is not a huge buffet  of choices here but they are going for quality instead of quantity!!!!!!!  Everything I tried was super delicious and fresh,,,you could tell it had been made that day.  They have wonderful fresh-tossed salads with quality ingredients like spinach and fresh mango,,also a fabulous fresh pea salad.  Chilled shrimp that had been properly deveined meticulously with plenty of cocktail sauce to serve yourself.  I had the best fall-off-the bone beef ribs and some wonderful fish that was tender and flaky.  Also tried a wonderful Italian wedding soup!  The dessert was wonderful too, we shared a  wedding-type white cake that was moist and had lots of yummy icing and they had fresh oriental almond cookies that were homemade and fantastic!!!  Also ice cream with toppings.  We will definitely be going back to this buffet!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to pay the price of the Talking stick buffet, then you should come here.  It's a sister casino with the same quality food just a little less selection.  Food is good, fresh. I even came a couple of hours before it was going to close and I saw they had changed out several dishes that had been out within 30 minutes of me getting there.  They are on top of their dessert game as well. So much selection (in regard to dessert) And I love the price."}
{"text":"Eagles Buffet is located inside Casino Arizona here in Scottsdale, Arizona.  I love this place.  I find myself coming back here again and again.  The food is good and the atmosphere is even better.  Servers are attentive and helpful. 

What I like is that there is a new theme every day of the week.  International dim sum, italian, seafood & prime rib, southwestern & sushi, it's all delicious.  Prices are reasonable also.  Adults $10.95 for lunch, $15.50 for dinner, except Wed-Sat where the dinner is pricier with crab legs, prime rib/seafood.  

Will be back next time I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Went here with the \"fam\".  This buffet cost less than half of the bigger casinos north of here, but how much can you really eat for breakfast? I don't need a pile of seafood for breakfast/brunch. They have waffles, some carved meat and the standard breakfast fare.  And very affordable, seriously. If you want steak and ribs, sushi, seafood, go to Talking Stick."}
{"text":"Was good. Can't complain. The desserts were a little old. Shrimp was awesome. A little smoky was its at the casino so can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is MUCH better then it used to be. I went for lunch on Presidents day and the food was much closer in quality to the Wandering Horse Pass buffet then it had been in the past. They had a little dim sum thing going as well as briskly and several fish options. For 12 bucks for lunch this was a good deal for solid food with some nice touches like root beer floats at the dessert station. I was not impressed on my last visit a few years ago but I was pleasantly surprised today."}
{"text":"Raw oysters on a buffet should scare me in the desert. But here...they have figured it out.  I was impressed with the quality at this buffet.  And you are indeed paying for it.  But still others have diappointed.
The other item outstanding for me here was the amount of  dessert options they had alongside a comprehensive buffet.  There is something here for everyone.  Even the most picky of guests could be pleased with something.
Make this a treat for when you have to entertain the mother in law!"}
{"text":"Great food but DAMN the service sucks! Every person that my family and I encountered was in a bad mood! Other than the people, the food was very good and had a fair amount of selection."}
{"text":"PSA: They will be closed 8/21/2017-September (TBD) due to renovation. 

Pricing makes sense- very reasonable for the quality, variety and experience you get. Prices also include drinks!

Came here for lunch around 2 pm on a Friday, and had about an hour to eat before they had last call. 

Highlights for lunch:
+Dimsum! I really liked the shrimp dumplings, \"shuai-mai\", and beef tripe. Stay away from the wonton soup...would have been cool if they had egg tarts!
+Cutting board steak/baby ribs: wow! Pretty good quality. Really delicious!
+Desserts! I tried them all, and the pastries are yummy! I also like that they have an ice cream bar fridge...compensates for the broken ice cream machine.

Downside:
-Dim lighting, couldn't really see much of what I was eating at the booths.
-Drinks: why don't you just have a soda machine...lol.

Overall, pretty good time here! The price is the same as if you just went out and got a single item, whereas you can have a hefty selection for the same price. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I visited the Eagles Buffet on a Friday about 12:30 pm. The price was $11.95, with tax $12.90. The price includes the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet and also includes your choices of unlimited soft drinks (Coke products), cold or hot teas, milk (whole, 2%, fat free) or chocolate milk. 

The main meal food area of the buffet is smaller in size. They had a salad bar area with assorted items. On one side was unprepared salad (romaine or spinach) with the other items beside it to add beets, peas etc, sunflower seeds, assorted dressings, fresh croutons. On the other side were prepared salads consisting of caesar salad, spinach salad, shrimp salad, ambrosia and a couple others. 

The main entree selection on this day was a 
dry-rub pork ribs, chicken (thigh, drumstick), chicken tenders, seared flat iron steak (medium to medium-well), baked swai (Vietnamese catfish), fried flounder, baked salmon, beef lasagna, some tex-mex style options.

They had a baked white and sweet potato mini area with all of the standard condiments to go on your baked potato.

They also had an Asian style area. Some options were dim sum, chicken feet, some wrapped sticky rice, and a few other items. 

They had some other miscellaneous options such as cabbage, garlic and cheese bread, mash potatoes, yellow sweet corn, pot stickers, chicharron (pork rinds), tostado, beans and rice etc. 

The dessert area selection consisted of fresh cookies, praline thins, assorted miniature half dollar size cookie/pastry/tart type items (the oreo one, and the praline with cranberry thins were my favorite), machine vanilla ice cream, assorted wrapped ice cream bars, some miniature cakes (thumb size) normal toppings for ice cream (cherry, caramel, butterfingers, oreo pieces, chocolate syrup, whipped cream etc), and a small selection of sugar free desserts. 

My waiter/server master of awesomeness was a gentleman named Tim. This guy was on top of things nonstop, remembered what everyone in his section was drinking, was grabbing refills when you reached about 1/4 left of your drink. Removed plates lickity split. Offered advice on some items to try since it was my first time here. I wish they had some most towelettes by the rib station, but Tim brought me a handful as well as about 10 napkins because of how messy ribs can be once the sauce is added. In my 45 years he is easily in the top 10 of the best waiter/server I have ever had. Ask to be seated in his section if you want a guaranteed awesome experience. 
He knows his regulars for sure. An older gentleman came in and before he was able to even get situated Tim had brought him his hot water, his regular bags of tea he always had, and his steep pot and cup. You can tell I think that Tim is THE MAN. 

The dining manager came around and greeted customers asking how they enjoyed the meal, what they liked, etc. She was very friendly and took time with each individual and I didn't see she felt rushed or like it was just her responsibility to do it, but felt she was genuinely interested in you and your experience.

Being a casino I knew there would be tobacco smoke. It gives me a headache so I try to minimize the time I have to walk through it or be exposed. Normally a casino places their dining area in a set back location where the smoke does not infiltrate the dining experience. Sadly this was not the case for Eagles Buffet. It had immediate access to the casino floor as well as the tobacco smoke and noises which accompany it. Recommendation, if you have an aversion to smoke ask to be seated toward the back of the seating area to minimize this. However, meeting Tim made it still worth the headache.

The food taste and cooking quality were pretty good. I did not come across any dish I tried which was over cooked or didn't have a decent to great flavor. The tables were very clean the food area was spotless, the glass protection over the food was clean and clear, the food handles were clean and not sticky, and the lighting was bright and allowed me to easily see everything I needed to. 

Thanks for a great lunch and experience."}
{"text":"2 out of 5- mainly because price vs. selection.  The buffet at Talking stick is about $5 more and I give that a 5 star.  
Eagles buffet had a very small selection and desserts were cheap. 
On a sat night and for $46 for 2 people. We were dissappointed. 
Good food and service.  Service people were awesome and place was clean and nicely appointed. Could do with a little more variety for food. My husband filled up on mashed potatoes and macaroni salad."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is incredible. This is the place we save when we want to spoil ourselves. My favorites are the champagne (of course), the eggs benedict, the cheese blintzes, and the creme brulee. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can give this more than 1 star. After reading peoples reviews I think that the buffet at one time was good. I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me. This is the worst quality of food I have ever had. It was tiny and the selection of foods were horrible. Greasy mess. I ate the bare minimum to get me full. I should have got my money back. Will never eat here again it's all yours old people."}
{"text":"We arrived about 1:30 for the Saturday lunch buffet.  We paid our $14.99 plus tax and expected to have a great \"lunch\" with lots of selection.  We had seen nothing advertising this as a \"brunch\" because had we realized it was more of a brunch than lunch, we would not have gone.  Needless to say, we were pretty disappointed to see have the lunch food really breakfast food.  

There were very few vegetables offered.  What we did have was very good but return trips to the buffet were just repeats of what we had previously because of limited lunch choices.  There were just too many breakfast options for someone thinking they were there for lunch. There was a huge selection of desserts.  So, the pastry chef must have been at work.

We didn't find the staff very friendly.  It started with the cashier who interrupted our conversation when we were paying to address another individual.  We thought we were polite with meat carver with our \"thank yous' but never once did he acknowledge or return a comment.  We thought him rude.  Sever became friendly the closer it got to tip time. Pastry counter server was the friendliest.

This was quite disappointing. We'd recommend Golden Corral as a better lunch alternative."}
{"text":"Last year when my father came to visit we tried the all you can eat crab buffet and it was delicious.  However, this past Thursday evening we stood in line for one and a half hours for the worst crab legs I have ever eaten.  There was hardly any \"meat\" and the crabs were watery.  Apparently, they were caught during the final stage of the molting cycle.  This was a huge disappointment as we were looking forward to it and I had even invited a friend.  Not to mention, a waste of an hour and a half and oh yeah, $60.00."}
{"text":"ohhhhh what a pleasant, delicious, surprise this buffet was. :D Friday dinner = 14.50 per person, including soft drink, and the food is glorrrrioussss. GLORIOUS. I ate like.. 8 lbs of smoked salmon, orange roughy, marinated Mediterranean seafood salads, a few fancy raviolis, and grazed on really tasty salad, antipasti, cheeses, ceviche, AND ALL SORTS of other really delicious delicacies. YAAY. SUPER CLEAN. very well staffed, with attentive service. Cloth napkins! FANTSY. THIS is a luxury buffet, for the same price, or just a few bucks more than what one would typically pay a gross chain buffet, infested with big, scary, giant human mutant things. I cannot wait to return :D The freshness/quality quotient is super high, and the value is stellar."}
{"text":"Other than the hour and a half wait in line :) , we took my in laws to the buffet for Easter (after checking it out on Yelp) I think it was the least expensive Easter Buffet in Phoenix at $23.95 and it was worth the wait!  They served Champagne until 3, they offered Prime Rib, peel and eat shrimp and Seafood Pasta.  I can never understand why people start on the salad bar with food like this!

This buffet is the best thing this side of Vegas.  Even including many of the buffets in Vegas I've had.  The food was very fresh and tasty, the service was okay, coffee strong and really quite nice!  There was an awesome selection of food and yum.

If they have the chicken cordon bleu bites, get some, they were my favorite!  I'll be going back-it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"They are very friendly here, this casino is more for locals as talking stick is more up scale . the food is good here and you need to call and ask what their main dish is before you go.They remodel the eagles buffet it looks really nice .The food stations are now more separated with a large dessert area in the middle ."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have been to in Arizona for the price.  Clean, nice selection, and a heaping pile of crabs legs each time you visit the crab leg station.  Try to go at least 2 times a year when visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at on a wednesday/thursday night. You can't really beat all you can eat crab for $18.50 plus not only do they serve endless crab legs they also serve other things such as chicken tenders, salad bar, taco bar. Drinks are also included. I really think you get your bang for your buck here. The crab legs here are seriously DELICIOUS. The waitresses are pretty attentive also even though their swamped with tables on the downside they prefer you to eat within a 2 1/2 hour time frame which is reasonable but the waitresses can sometimes be kinda pushy to get you out fast. But endless crab legs night is def a must to try. If you love crab legs you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"New to the area and was in search of an AYCE sushi spot. Their website looked good. Mmmm, sashimi, rolls, tempura?! YES!!

NO!!! This \"buffet\" was absolutely FOUL. Way smaller than an average buffet and it reminded me of a wannabe Sizzler. The \"sashimi\" consisted of salmon and tuna which were hard and visibly old. Cut \"rolls\" were a bunch of miniscule ingredients stuffed in a tiny round wheel of hard ass rice. One even had a hair in it! So fucking nasty. I tried the ceaser salad, overcooked green beans and a sliver of pork loin. Crap, crap, crap! 

What a waste of money. I've never felt so dupped in my life!!

{"text":"First time here. Came for the AYCE Crab Legs. They were wonderful of course, so was the fried chicken & the roasted potatoes were delicious. The salad bar was fresh, lots of flavorful choices there. Very impressed by the desserts, many choices & lots of small tasting size items. Even the smallest items showed great attention to detail & taste - every one I tried was amazing."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the weekday lunch buffet for its dim sum selection.  I especially like the tripe and chicken feet, which most  other Chinese restaurants that serve such items don't do very well.  The dining room is super clean and service staff are unusually attentive for a buffet.  The only downside is that, aside from the dim sum, the other selections on the buffet are pretty standard and uncreative--but do appear to be fresh and well-prepared."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every other month for over a year for crab legs. It's usually good, but once in a while, not as fresh. The last time I visited, I noticed they had sushi on Monday and Tuesday nights. 

A friend and I came to try it out. I was so disappointed. The website talked about having yellow fin tuna, ahi, salmon. But instead, I found smoked salmon labeled as salmon sashimi. I normally love smoked salmon, but don't label it sashimi and it was also quite salty. 

There were about 7 different kinds of rolls thy were mediocre including spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and a lobster roll. I don't think I'll come back for sushi, but I'll continue to go back for crab legs. 

I've always had good service."}
{"text":"Regrettable experience indeed. The food was very subpar for a casino buffet. There was a large variety but very poor quality. Much of the food was cold and tasted processed/packaged/store bought. The bread and cookies were stale. It was definitely not worth $16.50. 
The manager and chef came to the table and were very professional and understanding while listening to my complaints. Three stars for the staff. The manager assured us that every night is different but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We usually go on a Saturday for the brunch and it s overall pretty good.  I enjoy the BBQ pork as I love the sauce but they generally will not offer it to you so you need to ask for extra sauce.  I would have given 5 stars but the service behind the counter at the meat carving area usually sucks.  The workers turn their backs and act like they don't see people waiting for them to come and carve the meat so I would suggest getting your meat first so the rest of your food isn't ice cold before you stand there forever until they act like they just noticed you. They do it to everyone every time I've been here and it is soooo irritating because it is so obvious that they are intentionally ignoring the customers!   Anyway, the rib roast was good but the Au ju was cold so it made the rib roast cold as well so it really could have been great otherwise.  My husband always prefers to get breakfast and enjoys the made to order om lets.  The sausage links and bacon are good but sometimes also cold.  The hash browns are not crisp but look like they would be.  The onion rings are great when hot and fresh.  The salad bar is always fresh and amazing. The deserts are good but many times are dried out from sitting around.  The creme brulee is always a great choice.    It is kinda of hit and miss on the hot/ freshness but you can generally find something really hot and fresh to eat with the selection offered.  It is overall a great value and I enjoy the entertainment of keno while I eat."}
{"text":"Great food. Lunch buffet is 11am-3pm! Includes dim sum.

Only $10.99, if you sign up for a player card you'll get $4.00 credit to for food or gambling!

I came for a dim sim to be honest and got really full! 

Smallest, cutest sized portions.

A lot of choose from. Baked chicken, roasted pork, salad, variety of Asian stir fry! And much more."}
{"text":"As much as you advertise the daily dim sum, one would think it was good. So I was completely disappointed when I tried it today. From the ad, I expected more of a selection. The beef shou mei was scary looking so I did not try it. I've had better spare ribs. The pork buns and shou mei were okay. But not good enough for me to return. Basically, it was a regular lunch buffet with some dim sum selections. Like any other buffets. 

I'll just stick to crab leg nights."}
{"text":"I've been to many Sunday buffets over the last four decades in the Phoenix area, and I believe this buffet is one of few survivors of the genre here that is still generally reasonably priced relative to the quality of the food that is served. And the service here is excellent. That said, there are a couple problems that keep me from rating it higher. First is the chicken entree, which is usually some dried, unappealing roasted or baked fowl that looks as if it's been left over from some other buffet. Once in a while, this entree is changed, but not often enough. Or, why not sometimes serve turkey?  The prime rib is somewhat better, but here also it is not consistently tender. The fish entree is usually salmon--which is great if you like salmon.  Why not alternate with some other fish, like tilapia for instance? Finally, the desserts are decent, but they are generally the same from week to week.  So, overall a nice buffet...but there is definitely room for improvement in some areas."}
{"text":"Love the Sunday champagne brunch! You pay before entering, a word to the wise if your unsure of the place ask to take a look at the food BEFORE PAYING, this has saved us countless times at other places & they are happy to accommodate!! Once seated a server will ask what you'd like to drink and then let the games began! 

I think its around 15-20 per person, champagne included! Dipping station with chocolate fountain is my favorite, Strawberries, marshmallows, rice krispies. 

We also did their Christmas Day buffet and ended up just as happy! To be able to relax and enjoy your food rather then slaving away in the kitchen was priceless! Good variety for everyone. 

I'm usually not a buffet person but pretty happy overall.

{"text":"I'm a big fan of buffets and this one is apart of my regular rotation. It's a great buffet when you want something that's a clear step or two above golden coral or typical Chinese buffets. It also fits nicely as a step below from places like fogo de chao or Wandering Horse. The selection isn't giant, but the dishes are usually well prepared and you can get your prime rib and crab leg fix easy enough. The service is right on par with friendly and attentive staff which compliments to dining experience well. Overall, I almost always leave satisfied from start to finish, which means dessert. I always enjoy the creme brûlée and the frozen desserts often include drumsticks and other individually wrapped frozen treats. My wife loves the homemade cookies as well. It seems like this is a spot that can get overlooked, but if you can eat your monies worth or enjoy a good crab night it's a great place to go."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this buffet with my family last week. The challenge in getting here was taking a day off from work on a week day and getting the $9.95 week day only dim sum that I really wanted to try.

The dim sum selection was limited to 6 or 7 items but each of them was fresh and very good. The items that day were shrimp & pork shumai,  won ton soup, fried rice, steamed BBQ pork buns, rice noodle rolls, tripe, chicken feet, shrimp rice dumplings and pan fried dumplings. I don't eat tripe or chicken feet, but went back for seconds for all the other items. There was an excellent variety of sauces on the dim sum serving station. My son loved the dim sum as well and we both definitely got our $9.95's worth from it.

The main buffet was good although not a very large selection, but enough to provide a good variety.  I can't recall everything there but the items I tried that were good were the fried chicken (excellent), flat steak, baked cod and New England clam chowder. There were at least a dozen other dishes I didn't try only because I was too full.

Desserts included mini creme Brulee tins (awesome), chocolate and strawberry mousse,  the standard cake and pie selection and soft serve ice cream. 

For $9.95 (weekday lunch price only), I was really happy with this place. I went primarily to try the dim sum but happy with everything else I tried. Next trip back will be for a weekend brunch and will update this review....."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. On weekdays, the lunch buffet is $10 which is such a steal! I love comfort food like the mashed potatoes and the macaroni cheese and the baked potato bar with a plethora of toppings. I also love it when they have the nacho bar with limitless guac! Sometimes, they have an extra cart featuring other cuisines like an Asian cart that had Shu Mai and banana-leaf wrapped glutinous rice. Last, but definitely not least, the dessert bar...oh my goodness...I love the variety -- from the cute little tarts like creme brulee to the variety of cake slices like chocolate to the ice cream bars and the soft serves. I will always come to this place when I go to Arizona."}
{"text":"Clean, reasonably priced, friendly staff, good Sunday brunch selection, one of our favorites"}
{"text":"Everything I tried was great. Tip: For Thanksgiving, go later in the day if you don't want to wait in a long line (2 hours)."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet lots and lots of great food Asian Mexican and American food with tons of desserts great working staff and service"}
{"text":"Wow! They have remodeled and it looks like it is a success!  One gentleman said that they used to come here but gave it up for the Talking Stick Buffet.  He's back and loving it!  We liked it too!  More selections to choose from and everything we tried was quite tasty.  Kudos to the crew who designed and implemented the change!"}
{"text":"Not the largest selection, but the quality is there. They had a broiled Mako Shark that was pretty good, roast beef very tasty but a little dry. Salad offerings were fresh plentiful. Posole soup was hearty. Overall pretty good food and service was ok."}
{"text":"Met some old friends from Texas here for dinner. No trouble getting table at 6:30 pm.
Salad bar was okay. Not much selection, but it was fresh and clean.
Veggies, again, not much to choose from, but green beans and asparagus were good.
Meat options I tried were: a fried fish filet which was very good, crunchy outside, flaky white inside. Pork belly, pretty good. Slice of beef off a roast, tough and chewy.
Desserts were good, lady in this section was very nice. 
Overall, pretty relaxed atmosphere, service was okay, but don't over tip the way I did, when you pay upfront, doesn't seem to make a difference.
Okay, not exceptional."}
{"text":"Only have been here for lunch to have their All you can eat Dim Sum.

They recently increased the lunch from  $9.99 to $10.99.

They serve the basic Dim Sum dishes such as Pork or Beef Sui Mai, Cha Sui Bow, Har Gao, Chicken Feet, Short Ribs in Black Bean, Pot Stickers which I would recommend to have pan fried. There is also custard tarts and won ton soup.

The Sui Mai are excellent and worth going back for more. As are the har Gao and won ton.

As for the won ton go easy on the soup base and go heavy on the won ton.

Included is also the regular buffet items which are okay but I mainly go for the dim sum.

Fountain Drinks are included so ask what they have and if you have room also go for the ice cream.

This is only available Monday thru Friday starting at 11:00 am, go early to ensure they don't run out of certain items.

Will definitely come back again."}
