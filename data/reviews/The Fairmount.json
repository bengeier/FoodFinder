{"text":"This restaurant has normal portions for a great price, unique drinks, and the perfect size and variety of a menu. This is definitely one of my go-to places, and I have always had a great time.  Just walk in and grab a table!"}
{"text":"There is a young bartender at this joint that is literally the worst. Place was empty, real bad vibe. It was a very upsetting place."}
{"text":"I've been to the Fairmount a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. Very friendly staff with an attentive owner often on hand. Try the turkey ribs!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Don't miss the patio in back, if the weather is nice.   The pizzas are tasty. Wish it had a better beer selection. Their two drafts are always interesting, though.   The cocktails are crazy expensive for being middle-of-the-road. For two dollars more, you can have a cocktail at Velvet Tango. The one cocktail that is well worth it for the taste and the novelty is something that might be called a tequilla with pineapple chaser. It involves some pineapple juice, lots of cilantro and jalapeno infused everything. Damn good, and fun at the same time."}
{"text":"A cozy neighborhood restaurant with all you could ask for.  Inventive and delicious menu offerings.  Delightful, attentive servers.  Worthy, intriguing drinks.  By gosh, they even take reservations!  Happy hour is our favorite."}
{"text":"A good place a grab a beer with friends. It's casual but not divey and they have a great selection of beers. The back patio is a nice little gem for a sunny afternoon or a nice summer evening."}
{"text":"The Fairmount has its place. It's pricey, but the drinks can be outstanding. The pizza's are good. The staff is mostly cool!"}
{"text":"It's our neighborhood's only dive-in bar and it's not really an option to dislike it given the lack of alternatives in the Cedar Fairmount area. What I like the most about this bar is its patio in summertime. When it's cold, look for the less crowded part of this bar if you're not a loud college kid, which is located on your left side when you enter the bar using the main entrance. The main hall gets overcrowded and loud on the weekends. Food is alright, service is great but can get too slow on weekends, particularly at the bar. And I always wonder why they don't have any female staff."}
{"text":"This has been thus far the best place I have been to here in Cleveland. When you first walk in it's very welcoming and the ambiance of the restaurant is very artistic.  Best of all we had a fantastic waiter, Cameron. He was very attentive and made sure we were set. I was disappointed with my burger as it was overcooked, however Cameron made sure to remove it right away sent over the Manager. He apologized for the experience and asked if I wanted something else. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos.  The best thing is that he went back to the kitchen and took care of my order himself and brought it out. After some conversation with him, I learned he is the owner. Jake, thanks for an amazing experience at your restaurant. We will most definitely be back! The food was delicious and the drinks were on point and the atmosphere is beautiful!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to drink and dine. The owners are lovely people who promote local artists and care about their customers. The wait staff is very friendly, know the menu and can make great recommendations. The Fairmount has one of the best patios in Cleveland Heights and is a great place to either relax or host an event. The drinks menu is robust. I recommend the grilled romaine salad for lighter fare and the Bloody Mary's are fantastic. Also, try the pizzas. Delicious."}
{"text":"The best time to go is over the summer or on a nice spring day (my opinion). The inside is nice, but the back patio has a way better vibe. The drink prices are a high, even during happy hour, but it is a cocktail bar, not a college dive bar. The way staff was just OK. The food has good presentation, but other than that nothing to rave about. I've only gone for a few business functions, so that might say something (or nothing) about the type of place you're dealing with."}
{"text":"I go to the Fairmount fairly often, but only out of convenience.  It is within walking distance of my apartment so if my roommate and I want to grab a quick  drink this is where we tend to go.  However, I am moving to Lakewood in a few weeks and I wouldn't say it is worth the drive.   They have a pretty good Martini, Wine, and Beer list, better than most places located on the east side.  However, they can be pretty expensive, so I usually limit myself to two dirty vodka martinis which is already over $20.   The food is okay,  I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner, but a light appetizer for happy hour instead.   They do have a happy hour with martinis around $6 which is definitely worth it.  The patio is nice when it gets warmer out and there tends to be a lot of people out there.  However, the one night only the patio was open (they didn't have anyone working inside), so if you are not a fan of outdoor drinking/eating, you may want to reconsider going here if that is the case.    The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about every drink they have on their menu.  They make decent recommendations with the wine, sometimes I have been a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Biking amazing. We had a great time. Friendly and tasty.   It wants me to keep writing...ok. Here we go. The wait staff was cleverer than most. Drinks boozier. Hostesses friendlier.   It was more fun than prostate stimulation - giving or getting."}
{"text":"Stopped by for HH Friday night, food and drinks were fine. Everything was going really well until my fiance found a small worm on his napkin. After debating whether we should say something (as it lay squirming half smashed in the middle of our table) we decided we'd give someone a heads up. We called the nearest employee to our table, and in the friendliest tone possible pointed it out. We weren't expecting much apart from an \"I'm so sorry\" or something along those lines. Instead this employee looked at us as if we were overreacting and responded with \"yeah those are silk worms they fall out of the trees here, they're everywhere it probably came in on a customer\". Totally taken off guard by his response I pointed to the squirming worm and said \"okay but it's right here on our table....\" In a sarcastic tone he responded with \"....I can get rid of it if you'd like\". Really?! We were completely disgusted and after googling \"silk worms\" that's definitely not what it was."}
{"text":"Solid, local place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming in here! Service and food are top notch! Great drink selection and fun drink specials."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my husband. This is one of our favorite places to go to for a really nice cocktail. We have tried several drinks on the  menu and they all have been outstanding!!! They are pricey but so worth it. We have also ordered cocktails that were not on the menu and amazing as well. The staff is great too. They make sure to make the drink exactly how you want it. Haven't tried any of the food yet, but I am sure I will. They have a nice patio in the back, great for warm summer nights. Totally recommend this place for an after work drink or a drink after dinner. Bring your friends, spouse, parents, whatever! Great local bar."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night, they were very busy but our server was very attentive and professional. The food was absolutely amazing. I got the Angus burger which was cooked to perfection.  Their fried ice cream dessert was absolutely amazing. I totally recommend the place and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I went here expecting a mouthwatering pizza and instead ended up with a bland tasting pizza with what says grilled chicken on the menu and instead received what tasted and looked like shredded dark rotisserie chicken meat .AND THE SAUCE...let me tell you about the sauce, I asked the bartender how the WHITE SAUCE tasted and he said great, but when the dry pizza came out I saw no white sauce and when my dinner partner and I requested some WHITE SAUCE on the side, we saw what the issue was with the dryness, their WHITE SAUCE as they call it is actually a garlic butter sauce, which should be used for scampi or a scampi pizza not on pizza to be called a white sauce. The pizza had no taste whatsoever, it was just mainly texture.  The service was lackluster as well, I ordered a Manhattan and shouldn't have because I felt like I had taken three straight shots, so when I politely asked the bartender for something sweeter and even pushed the drink to the edge of the bar, he walked past me for me than five minutes ignoring me and when we had asked for suggestions on the menu before ordering food, he instead offered only his opinion on drinks, as if we weren't looking at the food menu. He even went so far as to discuss us with another customer when we asked for additional pizza sauce because it was dry.   Overall, the service was less impressive than expected and the food and its dull and dry tasting components left alot to be desired, just as the tip I left! I left with my pizza barely eaten and I gave it to my dog to let her eat when i got home and I heated up a Sam's club slice of pizza I had bought on a whim over the weekend, and it actually tasted better than the pizza here...which says a hell of a lot.  Word of advice, never talk about your customers with another customer because they make a request then have a dryer personality than your food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food (try the shrimp tacos!) and great atmosphere. Unique cocktail offerings. Beautiful back patio. Owner is a super nice, genuine guy. I live in the area so frequent often, and I've never not seen them busy! A favorite hangout spot for neighborhood locals."}
{"text":"Best bar/restaurant on the street. The food is surprisingly upscale for the cost and has great flavor and plating. The staff is hip and engaging.  Have a huge variety of craft beers that are priced extremely fairly. The ambiance of the place is classy, geared towards young working professionals."}
{"text":"Dark and stormies made with freshly made ginger beer made from scratch. I should stop there.  But I won't, because this is one of my favorite bars in Cleveland. If you're looking for $2 PBR, this isn't your scene (try the Jolly Scholar instead) but if you crave unique cocktails made from juices and liquors made on site, you need to come here.   I already mentioned my first recommendation: the dark and stormy, with a bolder taste than you've ever experienced before because of the pounds of ginger they mince and let soak in their mix.  The second must-try: the verdita and its sister, the \"rojo-dita.\" It's a combination of a shot of jalapeno (or jabanero, if red) infused tequila with a chaser of a cilantro/mint/jalapeno/pineapple juice. This is a unique Mexican recipe served at various parts of the world, but done right in house at the Fairmount with shockingly fresh ingredients. This drink has taken the neighborhood by such a storm that some other Cleveland Heights bars have begun to offer their own imitations.  The patio is a must-visit. It's one of the best in the metro area, to be sure."}
{"text":"a friend was moving to nyc.  so we had her goodbye get together here.  i know it's a martini bar, but i didn't feel like ordering a martini.  i ask our server for a whiskey and ginger.  he asks \"what kind of whiskey?\" i respond \"what do you have?\"  he responds \"jack daniels is whiskey?\"  um.....   WHAT?  maybe i misheard him. i must have misheard him.  i was there a few years ago during the winter, and it was a great warm cozy place to sit by the fire and drink martinis.  in the summer they have a great patio out back to enjoy the warm breeze.  but stick with the martinis."}
{"text":"The Food and The Drinks= Wow.  I just tried this place for the first time last night and now I am disappointed that I have never been here before. I love the quaint feeling you get when you walk in and by 6pm the place was crowded and the vibe was perfect. It wasn't too loud but you could tell everyone was enjoying the place.  Check out the Happy Hour menu (M-F 4pm-7pm)! Martinis and Wines are $6.50, Domestics are $3, Pizzas are $6.50 and they have a ton other food items that are priced amazingly.  I started off with the Naked Cosmo (white cranberry juice instead of regular). I actually sipped this martini slow because it was so delicious! My sister and I each ordered a pizza. I ordered the Apple Crisp Pizza while my sister ordered the Caramelized Onion Pizza. The bartender was awesome and modified our order by putting different cheeses on only half of each pizza. I don't care for goat cheese and my sister doesn't care for blue cheese. The bartender offered this suggestion of half and half like it was no big deal for the kitchen. How refreshing! Someone who isn't annoyed by modifications.   Both pizzas were amazing! I didn't want to stop eating them, however, I  did have leftovers so that I could order the Chocolate Covered Maple Bacon dessert. Wow! What a treat. It is served with vanilla ice cream that is drizzled with chocolate sauce.   I will be back soon to check out other menu items!"}
{"text":"The Fairmount is probably the biggest hidden gem in Cleveland. The patio is absolutely gorgeous, the food and cocktails are delicious, and the prices are great. I highly recommend any of the flat breads and the chocolate martini."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things. Go for a Moscow Mule or a specialty martini, stay for dinner. Back patio is AWESOME weather permitting, and the regular bar has plenty of space with a cozy vibe.  Food is great, lots of fresh healthy options in addition to usual bar/pub fare. Check out their late nite menu, too.  Best cocktail bar in the east side!!"}
{"text":"Best bar on the east side. Amazing, food, drinks and staff. Make sure to check out whatever they have on special. It's always amazing and they definitely put a lot of time and effort into choosing unique cocktails and dishes. If you're contemplating going, DO IT. Doesn't get better than The Fairmount!"}
{"text":"Still a 5, don't worry.  There have been some changes since I last reviewed: some good, some a little frustrating, but none will stop me from coming to The Fairmount.  The drinks all remain delicious! Ask the bartenders if you're struggling to make a decision--they're friendly and helpful! Dirty martinis are my favorite here, complete with cheese stuffed olives: salty heaven! The patio is still wonderful, though we got kicked (out?) of the patio to the inside bar once--disappointing, so we unfortunately cut our visit short.   I've been exploring the menu a little more and while the pesto scallop pizza is still my favorite item by far, the pepperoni pizza is also amazing. I've gotten happy hour seared tuna tacos twice now and it's one of the best tuna dishes I've ever had. Definitely stop in (and hope that the rotating happy hour menu hasn't changed) for some of those tacos if you like tuna.   The change that really isn't my favorite is the interior layout. The bar is now open in the middle which has put me in the line of server/bartender fire more than once. I've been trampled as well as stuck behind a traffic jam because this made the middle of the bar and dining area a main roadway between the kitchen and the bar. I also feel like the dining area is a little louder now that the kitchen isn't at the end of the bar to absorb some noise. I've always preferred sitting at the bar, but now I do even more than ever just to get a little bit of relief from the noise out on the floor."}
{"text":"This swanky little place is just the best. I can't believe I didn't discover it until August of this year. It's right around the corner from the Alcazar, a nice little bed and breakfast where I normally stay when I'm in Cleveland.   This place serves the best mojitos I've had outside of Cuba, where I did my service learning project as a senior (or should I say señor- LOL) at Oberlin College. The mint tastes like it was just grown and picked off at the peak of freshness, and I have no idea how they get limes this flavorful all the way in Cleveland! The neighborhood is an eclectic mix of upscale restaurants and housing- for a real treat, take a stroll up Fairmount Boulevard and see why all of Cleveland Heights's elite come here to unwind. This place might as well be a professional playground."}
{"text":"I once attended a \"discussion group\" that regularly met at this location. Odd experience. I think I was the only person there not divorced.   This place is chill and good for when you want to have a grown-up evening out."}
{"text":"I have been to the Fairmount for dinner and drinks a few times now, and while I find the lively atmosphere and the drinks fantastic, I think that the food and the service both have some room for improvement. In terms of seating, there is indoor and outdoor tables available. The outdoor patio gets packed very quickly around 6pm on weekdays, so I recommend you get reservations if you don't want to wait. I was with a group of 4, arriving around 6pm on a Friday evening without reservations and we waited over 45 minutes just to get an outdoor patio table.   The atmosphere is very energetic and lively, lots of chatter and mingling among an extensive selection of drinks, which makes it a great environment for dinner with friends, coworkers, or family. Highly recommend the super fresh House made Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) for all the designated drivers out there. In terms of food, the entrees are filling and have nice presentation, however I didn't find the taste of the food extraordinary. I ordered the Smoked Brisket Bowl, which ended up not having as much flavor as I originally anticipated from reading its description on the menu.   In terms of service, our waiter seemed impatient and preoccupied when he greeted us and took our orders. He also seemed annoyed when we requested for certain food allergy accommodations, which I thought was a very unprofessional attitude.   Overall, I think this is a convenient restaurant to gather with a group of friends for the environment and for the drinks. If you are looking for a dining experience with fantastic food and service, I would recommend checking out somewhere else."}
{"text":"You know those bars you go to and when you get there you think, \"Why don't I come here more frequently?\"  Yep, I think that when I go to the Fairmount.  This place has one of the best patios.  Period.  Great service.  Select foods and wines are 1/2 price during happy hour.  Just go.  Plenty of parking in the back."}
{"text":"Just so happened to be in this area and stopped by The Fairmount and I am so glad I did! There really was not one thing that I didn't like on my visit to here. I'll start off by saying what stood out was how the bartenders and employees were overly kind to us and were more than accommodating to our big group. Thankfully, they have a room just for such occasions and it truly is perfect for special events. The drinks that were ordered came out exotic looking and super delicious. The food was also not only very presentable but tasted amazing. I ordered the pulled pork tacos and the pork was so tender and cooked to perfection! The green sauce, not sure what it was called, just made it that much better. Our server was always around when needed and was more than helpful.  The place definitely has a charm to it that I really love. Its fancy yet casual at the same time so you feel comfortable in whatever kind of setting or group your in. I love that if you just want to grab a drink with a group of friends they have couches on the sides where you can just relax and catch up with friends. Though I don't live nearby, I can certainly see myself driving out of my way to come here for a drink or for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable prices, good wine list (try the awesome Evolution #9 white by the glass). I didn't go out there but apparently there is an outdoor area out the back. Great decor, cute bartenders and a good time to be had by the diverse clientele... from jocks to yuppies."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions and while the drinks were okay, I was unimpressed with the food and the service.   I've been here for happy hour, which is from 4-7pm M-F. They have \"deals\" on both food and drinks, which I felt were not that discounted (martinis are still $8... which I feel is a little pricey). The food was reasonably priced at happy hour, but still definitely not an awesome deal by any means, pizzas are $8.50 and some appetizers are $6. The quality of the food was even lower than these prices.   I've had the pizza here, which is okay but not really unique. I also had the Fairmount fries, which are basically fries with bacon and cheese. They're also okay but not spectacular. Most recently I had the spring roll, which is basically a ton of blue cheese, some proscuttio and a little bit of apple fried in this huge spring roll wrapper and served with ranch dressing. This was 95% blue cheese and 5% other stuff, and it was wayyyy too much blue cheese flavor, even for a person who is okay with pungent cheeses. And it was so greasy. And it was served with freaking ranch dressing, just in case you didn't get enough white creamy fattening stuff already in the egg roll. I really didn't like this dish (as you can probably tell) and this was one of the rare times in my life that I didn't finish restaurant food because I didn't like it.   Also, the service was really slow both times I've been here. To be fair, it's been with a larger sized group and during happy hour both times, but I still think that they should be able to attend to their guests even under these circumstances. For example, it took 45 min or longer to get our food, and then another 45 min to get the bills. I also waited for 15 min or so to get refills on water after we ran out. Finally, they forgot one of the dishes I ordered, although they got it out to me quickly once I let them know about it.  Overall, there are better happy hours in Cleveland both food-wise, deal-wise, and service-wise."}
{"text":"Always a fair time at the Fairmount !! Love it here! Drinks are exceptional and fairly priced. Food wise I've only had appetizers but they are DELECTABLE. brussel sprouts, too die for - anyway to introduce someone to brussels who otherwise wouldn't eat them. The vegan, gluten free truffle fries are phenomenal!! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. Love it here and will be going back soon ."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit.  Always crowded (in a good way).  The scene is cool and the place is well laid out.  Even with a crowd, you feel comfortable and it's not too loud.   The drinks here are unique and special and always are high in qualityas well as taste.  I opted for the Moscow mule and it was perfect.  It also came in the correct cup (copper) and stayed perfectly cold while I enjoyed it.    We also decided to order a couple of apps which this was the first time I had any food here.  It was really good and was well presented as well as portioned.  The service was also great and we were well attended to.  It's just a great place in a cool area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and drinks and gorgeous patio. Would be 5 stars+ if it weren't for the smoking on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar a few times---and never been impressed by any of them. The beers are good, but very over-priced. I've heard the cocktails are good, but I'm not willing to wait 15 min to get the bartender's attention to find out. (Please note, the long wait time is not because they are busy.)  The food lacks imagination and is mostly bar fare---pizzas, etc.   The patio is nice but, if the wind is blowing the wrong way, it might smell eerily similar to the dumpster right next to it. The location is probably the best part and I find myself there only because I have several friends in the area, and they enjoy going to a bar that they can walk to."}
{"text":"I mean who doesn't love the fairmont. Best outdoor patio ever. Fantastic drinks (Moscow mule). Great happy hour. Some top food hits include: chicken and waffle sliders, Asian nachos, quesadilla. Overall such a great spot to have in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Great food, always very fresh.  Sometimes service can be slow, but they are one of three big bars on a small strip of street. Staff I'd always accommodating and they take reservations!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable bar with food that rivals any place in Cleveland. The staff are friendly, the cocktails are on point, and the atmosphere is trendy. Love the Fairmount!!!"}
{"text":"VER-DIT-AS!   If you can't drink the green then hit the red light and stop coming here.  Drinks are prepared with care and the patio is the best on the east side.   Food is all good enough as well.   Super herby bruh, but still tasty.  Happy hour is superb as well.  An east side Cleveland spot to treasure."}
{"text":"The Fairmount is decent enough, although probably the only reason I really go there is because it was in walking distance from my house and therefore a good place to go if I don't want to worry about designated drivers.  I like their wine selection, and they have an extensive and fun cocktail list.  However, I'm a beer snob, and while they have some interesting choices, their beer list is fairly weak.  There are other wine bars in the area with better beer selection, and even some less-classy regular bars that have a wider variety of rare beer finds.  So beer fanatics beware!  Also, I don't think the food is particularly worth it.  It's very expensive, and there's not a lot to it.  Their cheese platter is one of the most boring I have ever seen.  Like I said with the beer, there are other places in the area with better offerings for a similar (or lower) price.  While The Fairmount has a friendly, cozy atmosphere, it's largely mediocre.  If you're in a position to spend the kind of money they charge, I recommend you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Drinks are pretty good! I'd say ask the bartenders for recs, because some of the offerings are pretty sweet and not everyone likes that."}
{"text":"After frequenting The Fairmount for a number of months, I think it's about time I share an honest opinion. The Fairmount offers a diverse menu that's updated regularly with original takes on ingredients and flavor profiles while also offering easily the best cocktails in the area. The food, drinks, and exciting atmosphere are a direct result of an experienced and dedicated staff that easily connect with guests which makes every visit feel personal. Quality can be a rare thing to find and experience at times but The Fairmount seems to deliver that experience every visit, to the point of questioning the idea of going anywhere else. If you're looking for an experience or just a place to hang out and relax - this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Unbelievably friendly and attentive service on a Friday night when the place was packed!!!  We had the fresh ground angus burger and their carmelized onion flat bread, and couldn't believe how good everything was!!! Also, huge bonus- you can get the flat bread gluten-free and they had a great gluten-free beer option. Lovvvvvved it!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!  Fun ambiance!  Great patio!  Knowledgeable servers!  Beautiful decor!  And a menu with just about anything you'd like.  Now if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that I'm a big fan of happy hours.  I think it's a great way to get a feel for a restaurant and not spend a lot of money.  The Fairmount has one of the best happy hours I've found.  There are plenty of drink specials but where they really excel is in the food specials.  There's a large happy hour menu with items for even the pickiest eater.  The flatbreads are my favorites!  And, the last time I was there, you could get three flatbreads for just $24!  They are delicious and huge!  You can also get a pitcher of Moscow Mules or Sangria for just $25!  Such a deal!  The regular menu also has some great items at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have had dinner at the Fairmount many times.  The food is excellent and the prices very reasonable.  The wait staff is friendly and accurate.  There is outdoor dining that is quite nice.  Large beer selection and interesting sounding cocktails although I've never had one.  Save a couple bucks by going to happy hour (till 7:00)."}
{"text":"I loved it!  My first visit! Recommend by a friend.  I took my family for my daughter's 16th birthday. Anytime I go somewhere the first time we try to order all different items. We had the pretzels, potatoes wedges and the meat and cheese board and all were delicious. My husband and I both had cocktails which were delicious.  Each member of our family ordered different meals so we could try each other's and we loved all the ones we tried. We also each had different desserts all great  My favorite is the salted Carmel fried ice cream!   plus the waiter was awesome!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Jake the owner is fantastic and the drinks are beautiful and delicious. The brisket jalapeño fries are a must. Jake makes really fantastic drinks. Just ask him to make something fun and you won't be disappointed!! If you are in Cleveland, this is definitely a place to go. We came from CA and this was the place we came for drinks and dinner. Everyone was fun and so helpful! All the food came out beautiful, presentation and flavor. If we come back this way, this will be our spot!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Fairmount for the first time. We parked & went to the front entrance which was closed & we were directed to use the back entrance where we originally parked. A bit annoying, but whatever. We were seated on the patio, which is nice. Our server was fantastic, but all in all, the prices are way inflated for what you get. The prosciutto wrapped asparagus was almost inedible. The asparagus was almost raw, & it was a total salt bomb above & beyond the natural saltiness of the meat. The corn & sweet potato fritters were fried balls of sweet potato with some corn thrown in. They just weren't anything special. My husband enjoyed the grilled cheese he had. The patio seemed to also be filled with some really obnoxious people. Again, our server was great, but beyond that, unless we stop in for a cocktail, we won't be back. There's just better options. We should have gone to Vero...."}
{"text":"Went here for friends birthday - good low key spot tower up with people. Not too crowded, fire place with fire going, and great patio when weather permits. They have food that I didn't try, but looked good. Decent amount of microbrews on tap, everyone seemed happy with the choice of venue."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons this restaurant gets a 5 star review is because of Madison,  the AMAZING waitor we had Friday night. He was super patient and attentive. It took us a while to decide on which cocktail we wanted but we eventually decided on one of the seasonal cocktails.  We didn't love them as much as we anticipated. However, Madison mentioned an experimental concoction that he likes (lemonade with muddled strawberries) to which we added vodka. DEE-LICIOUS! That drink seriously needs to be added to the menu. Simple, but so good. The food of course was amazing. Our group order the chicken bacon avocado flatbread, brisket banh mi, pub burger , and nachos. It's not often that everyone likes their meal but out of the 5 of us, no one had complaints. More than that, I will be adding this place to our weekly rotation. Definitely has become one of my favorite places to go in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We ate The Fairmount at Cleveland Scene Magazine's FLAVOR party.  The lobster Mac and Cheese was delicious. Their fresh House made Ginger Beer with alcohol was fabulous."}
{"text":"I've returned several times in the past 6 months. The food, drink, and service have been so consistent that I need to bump my review from 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I revisited the Fairmount for a second time and had a fantastic experience. I started with a margarita, which was deliciously prepared and had a delicious salt rim and garnish.   I then moved on to the pretzel bites. These were absolutely fantastic. They were cooked in oil and served with a cheese dip and jalapeños. The jalapeños were clearly fresh and added a delightful spice to the dish.  The Brussels sprouts appetizer was next, and the dish was perfectly roasted.   For my entree, I had the ahi tuna quesadilla. This was a fantastic dish. The fish was perfectly seared and had fantastic flavor. The bites were not all perfectly uniform but all were delicious.   I was incredibly satisfied with my return trip here, and I think it will become a regular rotation, particularly for their happy hour, when able to get off work."}
{"text":"This is the best spot in Cleveland heights. Never had a bad experience here. Always a good time!"}
{"text":"I never wanted to be a regular at a bar. But this place.. It's almost addicting. The patio is so warm and comforting; it's private and like a whole other world. Now that it's cold, the inside is even cozier, with the couch and the fireplace, and the general atmosphere. The bartenders are all friendly and you just want to be their friend. The owner is a great guy and super chill! This place is like home."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food.  The burger was great and so was the pepperoni pizza.  The price was right.  But the best part was THE SALTED CARAMEL FRIED ICE CREAM!!!!  It was amazing.  The best dessert I ever had!!!!   This is a MUST SAVE ROOM FOR kind of dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"YESSSS!  I absolutely loved everything about this place.  I love small, quaint, intimate places and The Fairmount fits the bill!!   My girlfriends and I were looking for a central place to meet up on a Thursday evening.  I frequent the Cedar Fairmount area, all the time, but had never been to the Fairmount.  I called ahead to make a reservation (yes!!) and arrived at 6:30, not realizing that Happy Hour lasts until 7 (yes, please:-)  Our server was super nice and very efficient.  We proceeded to order, Pomegranate Martinis and Moscow Mules, along with the Fairmount Wrap (brie, diced apples, walnuts, spring greens and cranberries, tortilla wrap and lightly grilled), with a side of yummy fries.  My other friend ordered the turkey ribs and raved about how tender they were.  All from the Happy Hour Menu.  The food arrived fast and everything was fresh and tasty.  Our table was cleared and we finished our meal and this was just an all-around great experience.  I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"While I love this place--their chicken and waffle sliders are probably one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth--the drinks are a little inconsistent based on who the bartender is and I prefer there to be a little more consistency across the board. If I get a cocktail and like it, I don't want to come back and have the same cocktail taste completely different just because it's a different bartender, especially when it's one of their signature cocktails. That being said they have some really good drinks. The flatbreads are delicious and the ambiance is nice if you can get a seat away from the door (the cold air does not make for a cozy night out).  The fireplace and couches are great, but on the weekends it can get pretty crowded. All in all its one of my go to's because the atmosphere is really great and the food is great. Plus the happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing drinks, groovy music, best patio in town...........and Mark!  My favorite item on the menu is the smoked brisket bowl.   Braised smoked brisket with mint cilantro rice and a mango sauce in a fried wonton bowl.  And please ask for the Pomegranate Martini.  For dessert I suggest you drink your calories with the chocolate martini, the most beautiful drink on the menu. Thank you Mark"}
{"text":"VIBE. HAPPY HOUR. STAFF. FOOD. DRINKS. This place has everryythingg! I cant say enough about this place except that I am soooo mad it took me so long to make it there! I went for happy hour with friends and was able to grab a drink at the bar and wait for them, the view from the bar is so great and I love the greenery on the wall in the entrance. The selection on the Happy Hour menu is so so so so so award winning. If you cant afford this place during dinner menu time then make sure you check Happy Hour out! We tried a bunch of things including the sweet egg rolls, pulled pork sandwich, lobster dip, and flatbreads. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! I would have gone back the next day and ordered the exact same thing. The margarita I ordered was the best one I have had in Cleveland, it reminded me of being on vacation in Mexico. The sangria I ordered next was a great selection of fruit in it with the cutest flower on top. The bartender was so informed and patient with us and offered suggestions when we asked for them. He told us that the Sangria is from a local winery (CLE Urban Winery) which is super cool. I cant wait to go back, definitely a cool place to meet after work or bring your family from out of town."}
{"text":"Okay, prepare yourself for the ugly truth! I hosted a party at the Fairmount in June and after carefully planning it out, it was a success. The venue was ideal for free parking, quaint Inside and outside seating and easy to reach and find. The cocktails were well made and most of the food was well prepared.  Now, on another note..major issues!  STOLEN FOOD, written contract NOT abided and not ONE SINGLE APOLOGY!!!  Jake, the owner, changed my menu because he felt it was better suited for my guests, although the changes he made worked against me. I wanted sliders.  He substituted a pasta dish and a chicken-veggie dish because he thought the sliders would dry out. Guess what? The pasta dried out and the veggies with the chicken ended up completely over cooked.  He also added roasted Brussels sprouts and not only do the majority of folks not like them, but mine didn't either. Mistake to add them.  Now as if that was not enough, our contract stipulated that all leftover food would boxed for me to take. The staff chose to box the food, place on an unattended table and two individuals (NOT A PART OF MY PAYING PARTY) , walked off with my food! LITERALLY!!!   When I questioned the staff, I was told that it \"sitting on the table\", however, they were to box it for ME, not any fool who saw it and walked up to help themselves. Unbelievable! To make matters worse, NO apology or acceptance of the FAILURE to follow directions.  When I brought it to the attention of Jake and his Mother, Jayne the following day...still no apology or consideration for the derelict of duty by the staff.   I would never, ever return to this establishment or recommend it for a large, expensive (btw) private party.   Just can't trust 'em!!!"}
{"text":"Many of the reviews of this place are old. I'm told The Fairmount has changed a lot in the last few years (for example, their cocktail list has expanded greatly). So keep that in mind when looking at reviews.  This is by far my favorite place to drink on the east side. The beer and wine selection is decent, nothing amazing, but you should be ordering one of the cocktails. They have a huge cocktail list, all of which is good (although I stick mostly to the gin and whiskey sections - I don't often drink rum and tequila and never drink vodka), and the bartenders are often willing to concoct a drink if you give them parameters, even if those parameters merely set a mood, as a friend of mine is fond of doing. Their ingredients - that is, bitters, ginger beer, tonic water, etc - are all house-made and they have a good selection of liquor (never have I seen so much good gin in one place in this region!). The drinks are somewhat pricey, but not inordinately so, and they're pretty much in line with the low end of the cocktail prices I got used to living in New York City.  Their food is generally good, but a bit pricey for what it is. I'd recommend eating dinner elsewhere and going to The Fairmount for drinks and possibly appetizers.  The atmosphere is good, but the place can get crowded on the weekends (I once walked in on a Saturday night to find nearly the entire Cleveland Orchestra there, along with others). There's a nice outdoor patio when the weather is good, and there's ample free(!) parking in back (hard to find in Cleveland Heights). Staff is generally courteous, although you may end up waiting a little bit if it's a busy night.  In short, if you like cocktails, get in here. If you just want beer or food, perhaps you should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We discovered The Fairmount by accident one evening last year when its neighbor Barrio first opened and we were too hungry to wait in line.  This was a very happy accident because now Fairmount is one of my favorite places!  Great food, great drinks, friendly servers, and reasonable prices.  They have a really great cocktail menu, ranging from the classics to some creative concoctions, and we've never had a bad drink here.  This is even more impressive because all of the servers double as bartenders for their own section; sometimes it means things are a little slow on busier nights, but you can be guaranteed everything is handcrafted with care.  I want to give a special shout-out to the Moscow Mule pitcher; it's delicious, gives more than the 4-5 drinks it says it will, is only $32, and comes with the requisite copper mugs.  The beer menu is always excellent, and the wine list is nice too.  I've never had a bad meal here, either.  Personal favorite food options of ours are the ahi tuna tacos, burger, fish and chips, steak frites, lobster mac, and caramelized onion flatbread.  It's rare that a menu this varied actually manages to be good across the board, but they pull it off.  There's a parking lot in back but this neighborhood does get crowded, so between that and the delicious cocktails, I recommend getting an Uber.  It's loud on busy nights, but nothing too crazy.  The patio outside is lovely in the summer (and an outside bar opens up to accommodate the extra crowd).  Oh, and there are happy hour specials from 4-7 on weekdays for food and for drinks.  There's not much more you could ask for!"}
{"text":"I am so embarrassed, and for the record I never get embarrassed....I really use to Love going The Fairmount, on any day of the week, especially for Happy hour and late night hour. I went for the first time in 2 months, they for new terrible staff, and a great late nights emu butt nothing even matters if u hot bad staff, bit anuway......"}
{"text":"My everyday spot. Feels like home. The staff are friendly and they get to know what you usually order after being there for few times. Outside patio is awesome"}
{"text":"Happy hour on a Monday? Why not? No crowds. We had a little farewell party over here for a friend and it was like we had the place to ourselves. They had this great seating area with a cool-looking fireplace. The food and drink selections were excellent. I recommend: the pizzas, burgers, fish and chips. However, the fairmount salad was a bit over-dressed, but that's totally my taste -- I'll order the dressing on the side next time. Otherwise, a great time was had by all!"}
{"text":"Wish they never took off the kale and sweet potato tacos off the menu but i still love coming here."}
{"text":"If there is an award for metropolitan sexiest patio bar, this place gets the blue ribbon. I really like the Fairmount a lot. The patio during summertime is truly unique. They have an indoor herb garden. This concoction called ginger beer is not really beer at all. In fact its loaded with vodka and will knock you on your arse in a heartbeat. Very delicious.  The Martini menu is expansive and totally unique. They have an extensive list of appetizers and tapas. Fish and chips are good, shrimp tacos are good, papardelle is very good.  Go for the experience."}
{"text":"Often go here for happy hour, and they have an awesome patio that can accommodate a large party. It's free for all seating, so try to get there early to claim your spots if you're a big group. All the food and drinks I've had are pretty good. Except their Cantonese nachos--I know people who like them, but they were definitely too oily for me. I generally go for their tacos or flatbreads. Also note that their portions aren't huge.  There's free parking the shred lot off of Fairmont--just be sure not to park on the Dave's side (there's lots of signs). Also metered parking on the street--free after 6pm.   A great place to come for HH after work, especially when it's sunny outside!"}
{"text":"Lovely cozy bar! Beautiful atmosphere. Crept in here really late on a cold and rainy Wednesday night and was greeted by a welcoming staff and warm fireplace. We came for late night eats seeing as though there is nothing else open for food at 1:30am. We also ordered a few drinks and they were well prepared. The food came and we were blown away at the portion sizes. Each item was huge! The pesto scallop flatbread was soo good! We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and two types of loaded fries. I enjoyed the loaded pulled pork fries. Definitely will order only about half of what we did the next time. All in all, I definitely will return and can't believe I've only just found The Fairmount."}
{"text":"I have a feeling this place is quickly becoming the Gen X/Millenial version of Nighttown a block or two away.  The crowd is young and hip.  Lots of younger musicians strolling in around 9pm and up after rehearsals or concerts.  And when I say musicians, I am talking about CIM or the Cleveland Orchestra.  I am not a big drinker, but the drink menu is renowned, great beer selection, and a nicely priced wine list (with the emphasis on 'nicely priced').  Oh, and the food.... nothing sexy but goes well with the food. Crab cakes and brussel sprouts are well prepared, and the tacos come in all varieties. My wife's favorite is the shrimp taco which is bursting at the seams with shrimp....... and you get three of these babies...so easy to split some of these among a group.  Service is friendly and spot on. The only downside, is it can get a tad noisy, but overall, a great spot to end a long day on a cold day."}
{"text":"The Fairmount isn't the first place I'd go if I had my choice of bar, but it's never done me wrong.  The place is dark, relatively quiet, and fine for a date or group outing.  Some of my observations: * Best thing about this place is the patio out in the back.  There's a separate bar and a number of tables.  Smoking is allowed here. * Decent selection of wines and beers * Food isn't outstanding, but fine if you're just looking for a nibble * There's a menu of 15 martini drinks that range from fruity to chocolatey to spicy that are just far too sweet and alcoholic for me.  It's just not my style.  But my friend likes the Espresso Martini."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love The Fairmount. So much so that we got engaged there back in January. When my then boyfriend suggested that we stop for flat bread after a day date to the museum, I didn't think anything of it and then out of nowhere, while eating flatbread and truffle fries, he popped the question. He obviously knows the way to my heart haha! The Fairmount is where we had our first \"real\" date prior to making things official and we had gone back a couple times after for the amazing cocktails and small bites. Every time we visit, we have great service. The bartender with the big curly hair is awesome and makes the best cocktails! We love the flatbread pizzas, truffle fries, atmosphere and artwork. According to my fiance, they make an amazing Old Fashioned and my drink of choice is the Dublin Mule. Didn't know til recently that they had a patio! Adding that to my summer to-do list! Definitely perfect for date night or an intimate proposal ;)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Prices are reasonable and the service is always top notch. The bartender is very knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"The food, drinks and ambience still remain topnotch! New items tried- cheese and meat plate... The cheeses were totally delicious!! Tried the fried icecream for dessert which was a let down ... The crust was not crunchy but a little on the soggy side which I did not like. Nonetheless... It's fried ice-cream!! I had my dog with me this time round & I appreciated the fact that they got him a water bowl as soon as we sat down.   This joint is definitely becoming a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"First i have to say that my martini was absolutely AMAZING! My coworker and I went there for happy hour and the food was also amazing especially for the price ($8 for a cheeseburger and fries great portion size) the staff was great they checked on us multiple times throughout our visit, cleared our plates as soon as we were done eating, and we were never without water. It was a little loud but that is to be expected at a popular happy hour location. Overall amazing experience and amazing food and i will be going back soon"}
{"text":"I count myself lucky to have The Fairmount within walking distance of my house. I have never had food that wasn't delicious, a drink that wasn't on point, or service that wasn't stellar. I have been to countless happy hours, stopped by for many-a-nightcap, celebrated, commiserated, hung with friends, brought out-of-town guests, entertained older parents, counted down to midnight on New Years Eve, etc... at my favorite watering hole.  Even when they get really busy, there is no variance in their service - so high five to whoever handles scheduling at The Fairmount (the formula for appropriate staffing seems to often go overlooked!)  Obviously, The Fairmount is my favorite, and I happily sing their praises!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service . Ahi tuna taco was excellent . Loved the French fries and Brussels ."}
{"text":"A couple Fridays ago I went to Fairmont Wine & Bar for Happy Hour. I absolutely loved it!!! The drinks were awesome and the grilled chicken  pizza was amazing!!! Plus it was half off for happy hour which made it even better.  The service was excellent,  the staff was very friendly and efficient.  I'll definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Great service!  Mark over here makes one of the best boston whiskey sour i have every had and a great memory for names too.   Prices are a little bit on the higher side but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Hello Fairmount. You exist less than a mile away from me, but how come we never met until just a week ago? Where have you been?!  Came here for happy hour and was highly impressed. Happy Hour menus are about $5-7 for food and $7-$9 for drinks.  Atmosphere (4): Loved it! The outdoor patio is is a pretty enclosed area that makes you feel apart from the rest of the world. My friends and I came here for HH and it was just a very gorgeous patio and great place to wine and chat.  Cucumber Fizz Drink (5): I've been pretty addicted to any drinks with cucumber in it, and I must say Fairmount sure makes it well! It has a bit of vodka in it but the cucumber flavor goes so well with the vodka that it's a very smooth and refreshing drink during the summer.  Jambalaya Pizza (3): Maybe I was expecting this pizza to taste just like jambalaya so when it didn't, it was a bit disappointing?   Sea Scallop and Pesto Pizza (4): Baby scallops and some pesto sauce, what could go wrong?  Apple Crisp Pizza (4): Surprisingly, delicious and refreshing! Not a bad choice!"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. My husband and I walked in on a Friday night and this place was packed. Enormous groups everywhere, but there wasn't one time that I had to look my for waiter. He was always there to take an additional drink order, bring more water. ect. We had the chicken and waffle sliders and the chorizo tacos- enjoyed both. Waffles had a soft fluffy texture that I liked and chicken breast was freshly fried and flavorful. Drink menu is expansive, but they are bit expensive for the little bit of alcohol that you get. I barely drink and many of my drinks tasted just like juice. So I had to deduct one star for that."}
{"text":"Great environment for young professionals to kick back and relax. My wife and I had the Angus Burger, which was cooked to order and quite nice. The homemade remoulade was awesome and went great with the burger and fries. Shirley Temples were also great (not for me, for my wife)."}
{"text":"I have been here 2x in recent weeks. Let me start out by explaining that there are 3 rooms, a lounge area, and probably the best patio on the East side.    They have a killer eclectic menu with something for everyone. Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna tacos, hanger steak with chimi churi, and the brussel sprouts. Oh and they offer the tuna taco in a lettuce (tortilla).  Efn fantastic.   They make a pretty bad ass cocktails. I usually go with a slightly dirty martini or a bourbon on the rocks, I know you bourbon snobs probably disagree with the rock parts.   Service is always amazing.  This is fo sho one of my favorite spots on the east side.  Perfect to meet friends, a date or just to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Best happy hour on the east side. Many options on the menu, prepared perfectly, and served with a smile. Great beer choices, cocktails looked to be delish, good wine list. What more could you ask for? Best of all, they have a nice PET FRIENDLY patio. What are you waiting for...go there!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable wine bar with great flat breads and fancier options than most bar food choices.  The drink list is expansive and the food menu is diverse.  The food is a bit pricey as my salad with chicken was $15.  The grilled chicken was slightly over done but the Fairmount salad itself was delicious with almonds apples berries and brie."}
{"text":"All in all I've been to the Fairmount Martini bar a few times, and each time I've had an awesome time.   The beer selection is quite vast, and their martinis are top notch.  The last time I was there I had the evening special which was a delicious concoction made of whiskey and beer.  I had two, and really, I didn't find the drinks weak at all.   We ordered food, and boy was I glad we did.  The pork tacos, which my homie Yana raved about, were delicious, and the ribs hit the spot.  I really enjoyed sitting outside by the heaters, taking in the last of the mild evenings.  The ambiance was awesome, and the fact that the patio is doggie friendly made my night.  Totally come here, drink eat, be merry."}
{"text":"I can't get myself above a 2 maybe 2.5 but I just can't.   Here's the deal, it's a cool little space dimly lit and decent amount of seating space. He bad thing is the coziness of the room dissipates within the the freezing cold temperature of the space. I understand that it has to be kinda a certain temperature for people to be comfortable but I still think the temperature needed to be addressed. There is a fireplace for F's sake. Make us feel cozy.  So beside the off putting temperature the waiter that they had was super pushy. He was there a lot and really pushin the drinks. You know that feeling of being interrupted? Well he did it over and over. Again, not cozy.  The margaritas were alright and it took a lot for me to get anywhere on the buzz factor and that isn't the case usually AT ALL. Maybe another night the heating will work and the waiter will have more to do."}
{"text":"Good wine selection. Perfect place to grab a few casual drinks with friends. We usually order the meat/cheese or the fruit/cheese boards, which are excellent."}
{"text":"Hey folks, this place, especially the patio is the bomb. My lady and I enjoyed the wonton nachos followed by some sort of ice cream ball rolled in popcorn then deep fried. Oh my. Yum yum. Drink selection and the service from Mike were stellar. Will be sure to drop in again when in town. I love Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! We had a fantastic server. We sat outside because it was a beautiful fall day. Ordered a few cocktails and 2 apps to start. The nachos weren't very good, they were definitely missing something. But, the turkey ribs were outstanding! For our entrees I had the lamb chops and my husband had the kale and potato tacos. Wow! Those tacos were really different. I wasn't expecting them to be that good but, we traded meals. The lamb was delicious and cooked perfectly! But, those tacos. Wow! For dessert we had the fried plantains with chili chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. Even with the spice it was delicious. Excellent service and food! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Fairmount happy hour and patio.  I come here pretty often with my girlfriends--if we want a quick drink to catch up or to drink away a bad day =)  If you come for HH, it's $5 pizzas and half off martini's.  The pizzas are pretty damn good.  For drinks, I recommend the Dark and Stormy (rum and ginger beer-so delicious and strong), Moscow Mule, Blackbird (their berry compote is to die for), La Verdita (if you're feeling adventurous and love you some spice), and if you're jonesing for something girly the Chocolate Martini.  They also have a lot of good wine and beer options (Christmas ale!). Servers are pretty attentive and friendly, although sometimes if it's busy service can get pretty slow.  I recommend just going up to the bar in those cases.  The patio is a must if it's nice out!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here. Always heard good things about The Fairmount so was happy when I decided to finally try this place for a dinner.   Place was empty on a Tuesday night. Pretty relaxed atmosphere and not pretentious like some cocktail bars. For people who prefer beer (like myself), they have a good draft list of about 10 craft brews, all of which aren't very common in the area. I ordered the Pilgrim pale ale from Madtree Brewing along with the Brisket Bahn Mi.  The Bahn Mi came with an epically sized egg roll and a few sauces - a soy sauce type thing + a sun dried tomato cream cheese that knocked it out the park. The meat in the bahn mi was tasty, but was disappointed with the bread. It was overcooked, overly crunchy and not a reliably sturdy vessel to commandeer the meat into my mouth. Disappointed with the main entree. However, the egg roll was tasty and well cooked - did not feel overly gross or oily like generic asian restaurants.  Maybe it was just a bad bread day! The rest of the menu had potential, service was nice and I liked the atmosphere. Will give The Fairmount another chance!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and dined inside. We started with a shareable Moscow mule, which was perfectly made. Some people opted for appetizers and others had entrees. While we each enjoyed our drinks, the food got mixed reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken and waffle sliders. A friend who got fish and chips was disappointed at the portion size and it being overcooked. Another friend ordered the nacho appetizer and didn't enjoy the flavors at all. Yet the grilled chicken sandwich was a hit. Overall, the atmosphere and drinks were great. Service was prompt and pleasant. Only reason this got 4 stars was the great variation in food satisfaction amongst the group."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland recently because my son was having surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.  The Fairmount was walking distance from our AirBNB;  this place turned out to be a wonderful find!  The drinks were great; food was delicious; and the nicest servers we have dealt with in a long time.  Truly a great place for us to unwind after long days in the hospital; and a real neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I'm a simple girl: give me a strong, well-made cocktail and some grilled bread with cheese on it, and I'm set for life. On the east side, the Fairmount is the place for quality tipples and fresh, flavorful drunk food. They also have a couple dozen bottled beers and usually a decent draft selection. The place isn't that big, so it gets pretty cozy in the evenings. Even when we've come on weeknights we've had to stand around awhile before seats opened up at the bar. I kind of wish they would take out the whole living room get-up around the fireplace to make room for more actual tables but I guess it adds to the intimate ambiance. The patio in the back is the place to be in the summer - there's a separate bar out there too.  Ok but who cares about that stuff? People come here for the drinks, and they should. Their catalog of a drink menu is organized by type of booze, so you can head straight to the promise land of gin and whiskey, without wasting one second on boring vodka drinks (sorry Russia). They do the classics - Palomas, Sidecards, Aviations - but Fairmount also offers some pretty exciting twists like the Tobacco syrup cocktail and the spiced pear Collins. Almost everything falls in the $8-$10 range, which is a steal compared to other cocktail lounges that somehow get away with charging $12-$15 - or even $18 - for the exact same thing. And props to Fairmount for actually listing the drink prices on their menu, I hate having to feel like a cheap-ass and ask. Nothing ruins a good buzz like getting your bar tab and realizing you spent $15 on one pour of mid-range liquor.  We also had our rehearsal dinner here out on their patio last summer, and it was definitely a success! They really knocked it out of the park with the food and service for our group. Peppadew poppers were a huge hit, and I think they have these on their regular menu. It seems that they've expanded their food offerings since we've been there, but I've had several of the flat breads and they are the perfect accompaniment to the drinks."}
{"text":"I live in the area so I've been to this bar a few times. I like the atmosphere, but the people who work there are a bit rude. The last time I went, they added tip to my single drink order and failed to mention that they had done so after I left them cash tip at the bar - same guy who ran my card/put in the order took the cash. I didn't feel the service  merited a $3 tip for a $7 drink. Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time I've had trouble with the service here."}
{"text":"Always a good time. Service and cocktails are consistently good! Vibe is as cool as Cleveland Heights Coventry area. Bravo for the continued growth and for having a culture of supporting independent owned establishments!"}
{"text":"Ended up hanging out here with a large (and ever-expanding) group on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. People enjoyed the appetizers (Brussels sprouts, pretzel bites, and fries), cocktails (rum toddy, moscow mule, negroni), liquor (Laphroaig, (somewhat surprisingly) Fernet), and beer. Our group convened around a table, and then decamped to the seating in front of the fireplace to continue our evening. Really lovely.  They have a little indoor herb garden that's pretty and provides fresh herbs for many of their dishes. Liked the decor and service in general. Nice place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We were told the food was good. But we never had a chance to try it. However, we SAW food. And it looked ok.  Friday night: Looking for a place to grab a Happy Hour special for food and drink, my friend and I headed to Fairmount expecting great food, drinks and atmosphere based on recommendations from others.  Upon entry, we noticed it was LOUD. VERY LOUD. Not something I would expect from a \"Martini & Wine Bar\".  We also noticed that there were (2) empty tables in spaces that could easily accommodate another few tables or two. The front setup was just very strange. The space seemed that it could have been utilized much better. We wanted to sit more towards the back, however many sections were reserved (and mind you, there are not many sections to begin with). There was a table that we could easily move to the other side of the pillar (why was it under a shelf???) and we flagged down a server (yes, we had to flag one down) and asked if we could. He looked annoyed that we had tapped him on the shoulder, and then stated he would ask another. It took a while for the other to return to us to advise that it would not be good because of a group of 20 coming in for the reserved spot.  He suggested we wait for the ladies in the corner to pay the bill as they just asked for it. We decided that we would rather take the table in the front, out in the middle of. Well. The \"space\".  Mind you, he made no offering of taking a drink order.  When we were seated, he did not return. Nor did any other server. I had to find a menu (laying on the bar) and then flag him down to put an order in before the Happy Hour time was up. It was NOT that busy at 6:50pm, mind you. We were noticing something too...people who were seated without food, looked annoyed.  We also noticed that their food FINALLY came a long while later. But anyhow.  We ordered a drink...and it took a while. And these were just draft beers (which, were WAY OVER PRICED for a Happy Hour. $5.5 for a GLBC Xmas Ale? I am afraid to ask what normal hour pricing is...)  After spending nearly 10 minutes waiting for the drinks, and then waiting another 10 for the server to return...we decided to just ask for our check. The food didn't look that worth it. We couldn't hear each other without yelling and the folks who FINALLY received their food in the corner didn't look all that thrilled.  Hey Fairmount? It might be best to decide whether you want to be a Wine Bar, or a college sports bar that serves expensive drinks and small plates. Wait...I believe you have decided.  As we have decided that it won't be worth a return."}
{"text":"In the neighborhood and felt like a nightcap.  The boyfriend suggested The Fairmount.  Found  seats at the bar and proceeded to peruse the menu.  Right away I was drawn to Ramos Gin Fizz.  I am obsessed with Gin Fizz or any cocktail prepared with egg whites really.  If you haven't had one don't be scared and order one next time.  I'm glad I did.  It was one of the most delicious cocktails I have had in awhile.  I will definitely be back for more, especially when I saw \"Chicken Waffle Sliders\" on the menu.....whhhhhaaaaaat? Also they have happy hour until 7 and the menu didn't look too chintzy"}
{"text":"The place to eat and hang out on the east side. The best Moscow mule you'll ever have. Gotta try the verdita shot! Order anything on the menu because it's all good!"}
{"text":"Overall a very solid bar, with great drinks and a good kitchen. They have seasonal drink menus, which are fun to try one or two. I've heard it called a hipster bar, or uppity, but I find it to be a great go-to bar for meeting up with friends or lovers. The back patio is fantastic in the summer, and they have a cozy fireplace inside for the winter!"}
{"text":"Since I wrote my previous review last year, they have really improved their consistency with the drinks.  Also, they changed their drink menu up recently and I've been impressed.  The roasted negroni is f***ing delicious.  Still haven't tried their food, but this place definitely serves the best cocktails in CH.  Their patio is awesome and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"So full discloser, I live about 175 yards away, and Holy ____! (fill in the blank), did I get lucky walking into this place a few days after my move. It was quite night, which is not the case much anymore!! Sat at the bar had a few drinks made a friend. The Bartender was very nice and the place had a great vibe. I have been back 8+ times. My first meal was the Grilled Salad(WTF) never hear of this before in all my travels(or maybe just missed it at other places), but it was incredibly good. It had a fantastic grilled flavor which I don't know why, but I never expected, and was huge!! The soups change monthly and everyone I have had was great. The flatbreads & pizza's YUM, the quesadillas muy, muy, buen, and go figure they have a late night breakfast burrito, Holy _____(again)!!! Now I can't wait for Spring/Summer/Fall when the back patio opens, it's HUGE, heaters, and outside bar!!! This place is my dining/living/den down the block!!"}
{"text":"I love the Fairmount.   My guy and I went to Cleveland Heights a couple months ago and wound up there for drinks on the back patio. So much fun. We didn't have the chance to try food, so we tacked in on our list of places to go.  We went after an event we attended last night. We were driving by when we just decided to stop in. It was pretty empty, so we sat down and were helped right away. I got the House Cabernet for a decent price, and a decent pour.   My guy ordered the brisket bahn mi. Oh my gosh, what a treat. So juicy, flavorful, and filling. It came with this spicy aioli that was spectacular.  Now, on to my dish...I ordered the Prosciutto and Pistachio Flatbread...the BEST flatbread I've ever had, hands down. It was salty from the white sauce, proscuitto and cheese, but sweet treets in the candied pastachios, pear, and balsamic really made the bread complete.   Yum. Yum. Yum. I will go back specifically for the flatbreads. They made my night.  The Fairmount has a cool vibe. I immediately loved the place because of the wood box planters they had on their main wall when walking into the restaurant. So trendy and cool."}
{"text":"Very comfortable patio with a great drink menu. Although nothing in particular is necessarily exceptional, overall it's a nice place for a pleasant night."}
{"text":"New as of Fall 2017 - now featuring an all vegan menu in addition to the regular menu. And this isn't any old wimpy vegan menu - there are appetizers, tacos, pizzas, sandwiches, entrees, and more!  I had the bahn mi on my most recent visit and really enjoyed it. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here during a short visit to Cleveland. If I lived nearby, this would totally be a regular spot for me.  The bartender was personable , friendly, and made fantastic drinks.   The space is larger than I expected, (I'm used to small spaces in the Bay Area.)  Everything was clean. and  I liked the décor/ambiance.  Awesome find!"}
{"text":"Their drinks are a little pricey but are very good. I recommend getting any drinks with ginger beer which they make themselves! They also have homemade coffee-infused vodka which they use in the White Russians. If you like tequila and spicy things, try La Verdita or La Rojodita. They come with a double shot of jalapeno-infused tequila and a double shot of spicy chaser!   Check out their happy hour (weekdays from 5-7pm). They've recently updated the menu to include appetizers and added more drinks at the happy hour price. Their martinis are on strong and delicious!   The patio is perfect to enjoy the beautiful weather. The staff is super friendly and talkative. They're a fun bunch that can make some darn good drinks!"}
{"text":"The Framboise Bellini was amazing and the carmelized onion pizza hit the spot, though it did take a while to get to us. . ."}
{"text":"So being new to the Heights area; a couple months ago my boyfriend and I decided to stop in at The Fairmount.   Now let me just tell you; the drinks here are so delicious you won't know what to do with yourself. They make their ginger beer in house, and they also have many other infused liquors to adhere to any pallet.   My first time in here I got a John Daly. Which is an alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer. And I was not disappointed.   And the next few times we went I kept getting more adventurous. With such an extensive menu; and really awesome bartenders you simply cannot go wrong with any drink.   List of drinks that I have tried; John Daly.  Mezcel mule.  Champagne cocktail.  French 75.  The blackbird.  The Sedona.   Let me just tell you something about The Sedona. It's amazing. A drink that combines pretty much everything I love. If you love good cocktails; I would say get this one first.   The atmosphere is amazing. The patio is awesome. The service is amazing.   Go here for sure. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the veggie quesadilla which I thought was a GENEROUS serving. and the house white and red wines are also yummy and generous in size. My better half however was dissapointed with the cost for the quality. well, too bad for him I guess since we paid separately."}
{"text":"Excellent find! Great chicken tacos... and many other items on the menu that will warrant a visit. It is slightly noisy because of the acoustics of the place...   A separate Hair Stylist and Pilates studio upstairs for before or after.. that you access seemingly from inside the restaurant..."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant and bar. LOVE their martinis with stuffed bleu cheese olives. Their menu rotates but some of my favorite staples are the wonton nachos and Brussels sprouts. Do yourself a favor and sit on the patio when the weather is nice. It's the perfect vibe. Impeccable service, and not too stuffy or overbearing."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic bar! Tried most things on the menu so far. Same with drinks. Custom drinks (not from the menu) are also consistently great. The bartenders and servers are fantastic! It's an ideal combination of a friendly local watering hole, and a high-end bar/restaurant.  I never had a bad experience at The Fairmount!"}
{"text":"You might find yourself wondering what a fresh and superbly crafted drink tastes like. Well, a combination of friendly service and natural ingredients, you might find yourself at The Fairmount. Carefully executed drinks and food are what you'll find here. The food is a variety of small plates to entrees consisting of all types of flavors. The refinement at The Fairmount is welcoming to all palates of taste and the atmosphere is romantic but relaxed. The patio during the warm summer months is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and sip on an ice cold fiz. Signature cocktails and fantastic specials give even the critics a challenge. The Fairmount is the hot spot in Cleveland Heights and with the such a great staff, you'd be foolish to not check it out."}
{"text":"How have I been blind to The Fairmount when it has been just a hop-skip away from Dave's Supermarket? I enjoy an establishment that has multiple options for seating, makes me feel like I have a butler, serving me amazing food in the comfort of my home.   I came here on a Saturday night with a few friends and was pleasantly surprised by the casual feel. We sat at the bar for a while waiting for the rest of our party, then casually made our way to the couches in front of the fire, before eventually snagging a few tables and pushing them together (felt like the progression of a relationship...sped up hah).   - Drinks: They boast an expansive menu with lots of interesting and fun cocktails. I was tempted to try the infamous La Verdita or La Rojodita, but alas fell for the Ramos Gin Fizz instead. As far as fizzes go, this was one of the best I've had. I've recently discovered the versatility of gin, and this drink wastes no time in proving that point. It was refreshing, light, and slightly tangy. The best part was the miniscule amount of spicy aftertaste, that surprises and satisfies.   - Food: Portion sizes are very generous! Our table was a smorgasbord of good choices: pulled pork tacos, chorizo tacos, bruschetta, grilled steak quesadilla, and brussel sprouts. I had the chorizo tacos, and they were scrumptious. The hard shells were tasty and substantial with a perfect amount of stuffing so that they were filling without being overly messy. Also the dipping sauce on the side was a great flavor combination.  - Service: It could be better. We did have to wait a while before our waiter took our food orders. However, when he did manage to come around, he was courteous and informative.  Overall great experience. I will be back for you tequila shots!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, cocktails, and food! They're happy hour is awesome. Bartender with the fro is awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went there with bunch of friends on a Wednesday happy hour. Ordered Rasberry Martini which is pretty good. I enjoyed it . But I have to say the service is not quite good. It's quite busy but they only have 2 servers. We asked for water and it never came until 2 hours later (we reminded the waitress). The outdoor patio is nice. My friends ordered some pizza with great price"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service was so good, you should definitely go here.  EXCEPT SOMEONE KEEPS PLAYING PHISH. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT??? WHO THOUGH IT WAS A GOOD IDEA?  listen: NOBODY LIKES PHISH EXCEPT FOR PHISH FANS.  STOP PLAYING THAT NONSENSE. Trey is an overrated guitarist at best and he can't sing his way out of a paper bag. STOP IT.   Otherwise this place is great and you should come here. But if you hear nonsense pumped through the speakers walk out. Someone at this place needs to stop it. Just stop."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Fairmont! The cocktails are always well made and unique with an extensive list. (Mark--guy with curly red hair--makes the best ones!) Food menu is also pretty delicious with good pizza and tacos.  Ambience is great both inside and outside.   Huge downside is cost! Drinks and food r pricey and it is way too easy to build up a hefty bill. Otherwise I'd be here more often!"}
{"text":"Holding a star hostage until the wonderful buttery crusted personal sized pizza comes back.  I have been returning pretty much just for these personal sized pizzas for the last few years. Always loved the staff, food, cocktails, and beer.  As much as I'd like to, can't commit to a 12\" pizza.  So sad."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Cleveland Heights. Always a crowd pleasure. Great food (Cantonese Nachos are a must!). Even better drinks. The patio is the best in the area. Good for dates or happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is a pretty great deal for the food! Drink selection is good too but doesn't compare to the food in my opinion. Have gotten a bunch of items in the past. The last time we were here, got the fried chicken sandwich with fries and the salumi flat bread. Both were large and filling.  The main waiter/server guy is really nice and attentive. In the summer, their back patio is a great place to relax.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good happy hour deal!"}
{"text":"6 STARS! Wow! If you are not going here you are giving yourself one star. We have been here before for drinks and it was good. Tonight was perfect! Jake, Mike and Aria knocked it out of the park with tonight's service. Above and beyond anything we could have expected. They made us feel like more than locals, they made us feel like owners. Everything was perfect. Jake is a master when it comes to an Aviation cocktail. Mike makes things happen. And, Aria was the epitome of the perfect server. Thank you all for making tonight more than special, you all made it memorable!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Fairmont a few times for both dinner and late night. I have had great food experiences here, and I think the venue is great for a casual late night. I will say that for dinner on Friday and Saturday it is LOUD and crowded. I also don't think they have enough to staff waiting on their busy nights. Brussel sprouts and sliders are great here, and their pizzas are pretty good."}
{"text":"Yes.  This place is fantastic.  We just happened to stop in during our search for an apartment in the area and we were definitely very happy that we did.  The drink menu is great - a lot of old school classics.  My favorite was one called the Floridita Especial - a delicious blend of rye whiskey and other flavors that may be one of my favorite drinks ever.  We had a few things on the menu to eat, as well - a cheese plate, shrimp cocktail - and they were all very good.  It wasn't a super busy night, but the vibe was just right and the service was perfect! We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in Cleveland! Especially the Moscow mules w their made in house ginger beer"}
{"text":"Well, I'll start with the good first since there won't be a lot to write. We really liked the ambiance here. Also, our drinks, the fries, and the apple crisp flatbread were all very delicious. We also had a specialty dessert at the end which was also good.  We were extremely disappointed with the service. All of the servers acted very arrogant and didn't seem to care at all about the customers. When we ordered our drinks it took forever for them to come out and we didn't even get any water until I asked for some in the middle of the meal. As an appetizer we ordered the meat and cheese board and for entrees we got the Angus burger and the apple crisp flatbread. I ordered my burger medium done and it came out very well done. Obviously, this wasn't the servers fault but he never even asked us how our food was. We literally had to wave him down to tell him. He took it back without saying anything. I didn't know if I'd get another one or what was going on. In addition to this, we never got our meat and cheese board. When we asked about it, it was brought out in the middle of our meal. The presentation and taste of it was very mediocre and left us very unimpressed.   After all of the complaints the service slightly improved and I did get a very small discount off of my bill but I don't think I'll ever return. There are plenty of options in Cleveland with much better food and service."}
{"text":"A fancy setting with good beer, and large cocktail selection. They are a bit pricey,  but that comes with the atmosphere. There fries were very good and so ore their mojitos! It's a nice place to get a drink and still be able to have a conversation without shouting."}
{"text":"First Fairmont visit!   I've been eager to stop into fairmont after stopping by the booth at the FLAVOR event. Loved the atmosphere, our sever Josh (I think was his name) was attentive & laid back. We stopped in strictly for happy hour to check out the atmosphere, before catching a movie. After reviewing the menu I can't wait to come back and dine!   The only thing that caught me off guard was a $7 house HH wine when beer was priced at $2-$3 a bit pricey for HH. The food HH list was impressive & I will be back try the fish & chips or the chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"Such a good vibe to the restaurant, especially outside. Great generous drinks (creative drink menu), amazing food (always recommend the vegan/gf truffle fries and the brussel sprouts.) Very friendly waiters/waitresses. Always a great time."}
{"text":"Y'know, I watch Sex and the City pretty often, and it always seems like the girls are going to swanky new bars all around NYC. When I first entered The Fairmount, I felt that it had the potential to be one of the \"new swanky bars in Cleveland\". Things like that are what keep young folks in Cleveland and encourage them to socialize, so I'm happy when one opens up and does well. It was a Friday night, and the place was packed--so packed that we actually had to go somewhere else actually--and the clientele looked young and well-to-do. I was really disappointed when we had to leave and go someplace else.  A month or so later, we returned on a weeknight for some drinks. I had a beer and my wife had a mixed drink. Maybe my hopes were too high, but I was really disappointed afterwards. First of all, there is truly a paucity of seating at this place. Worse yet, the few chairs that are there are not very comfortable. Maybe I'm just a glutton, but if I were running any type of operation in which my goal was to get customers to sit as long as they can and buy more and more drinks, I would get the most comfortable chairs known to man (and woman!). Secondly, the lighting level of the place borders on being too dim. Thirdly, the quality of the mixed drinks doesn't measure up to the high price either. Lastly--and if you don't like sports, you can skip right to the next paragraph--the TV's were pretty small and I think they were only meant to be seen by the folks at the bar...meaning that those of us who don't sit there yet still care about catching a game need to bring a telescope to see what's going on.   Maybe sitting outside would make it better? I dunno. We went before it was nice enough to sit outside...  I would go here again, but it sure wouldn't be my first pick to grab drinks at night. Jimmy O'Neal's on Lee Road, The Winking Lizard in Coventry, or even Jillian's across the street would be higher on my list."}
{"text":"When it's snowing and you just want to find a warm, cozy place to sip a cocktail and enjoy great food, it's The Fairmount. Great Happy Hour menu. And it is valid everywhere in the restaurant. Not just the bar.  The Veggie Burger is obviously housemade because it's flavorful, textured, and falls apart a bit. It was delicious. The toppings are perfect.  The Pulled Pork sandwich was great too. Drink prices not too bad, great atmosphere, and the service was excellent. My next trip will include the small plates menu and probably the flatbreads."}
