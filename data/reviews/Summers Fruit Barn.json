{"text":"Love this place. Yeah, the produce rocks, but I go for the bread, the sinfully delicious fresh baked bread - Cinnamon, Cherry, Cranberry Orange, Mandarin Orange, Almond Poppyseed, Blueberry, Marble Loaf, Apple... Their sliced bread rocks too, of course - honey wheat, sourdough, garlic cheese... I didn't care for the Jalapeno Cheddar (not nearly enough cheddar), but otherwise... mmmm! Ask for their Frequent Bread Buyer Card and get a free loaf when it's full. Lots of sweet treats as well - crumb cake, sugar cookies, macaroons, even peanut brittle. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love it when I run into \"my people.\"  In this instance, I'm referring to New Yorkers.  The Fruit Barn is a family run estabishments and the owners are from upstate NY (or mid-State - depending where you are coming from).    The store is kind of like an expanded fruit stand you might find at the side of the road.   The produce is locally grown and they sell a large selection Arizona-only made products (like Honey, dressings,  and nuts) -- stuff you might find at AJ's.  They also have fresh baked breads - off all flavors and varieties.    Bring cash because they have funny credit card/debit card use charges.  This is one of those little  local stores that you need to stop in and support!   With Thanksgiving and Holiday celebrations coming up, you have a great excuse to stop in and check them out!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious sandwich made with fresh ingredients and served with excellent customer service then this is your place. Very tasty sandwiches I highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"My review is for the Sandwich Shack @ Summers Fruit Barn. The Sandwich Shack is just behind the Barn, so it's not obvious from the street. Once you park, go to the wood-paneled building north of the Barn and you'll know what I'm talking about. What you'll find is a low key counter with some amazing with a sandwich order form. See the pics. All the produce ingredients are local and you can taste it upon first bite.  I asked for a roast beef sandwich, toasted, with all of the veggies. Amazing. Next, I'm trying the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Love this place! And everyone needs to gt the okra! It is amazing and super easy to fry!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Had one of the best tuna sandwiches here!  I have been wanting to check out so I popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the prices and fair variety of locally grown produce as well as bakery goods, jams, and other goodies.  The debit card dollar charge didn't make me happy but the sandwich gave me temporary amnesia lol I will definitely be back with cash!:o)"}
{"text":"They do NOT have the sandwiches anymore, and haven't for a long time. So go there for the produce but don't expect to eat lunch there. Summers Fruit Barn has fresh local fruits and veggies, homestyle jams, soups, salsas in jars, local honey, and chili peppers and even gift baskets . Prices are very reasonable. Sometimes she does insane deals, like 10 cases of strawberries for 10 bucks. It's the only place in this area that has heirloom tomatoes and several varieties of local citrus.  Most of what Fruit Barn has is organic - not sprayed with killer chemicals - so expect \"imperfect\" looking fruits. It's supposed to be that way and the taste is incredible. There really is a difference between locally grown, organic produce and the green house stuff you get at Fry's.  Unfortunately she closes for a good chunk of the year. But when Fruit Barn is open, it's awesome."}
{"text":"I have only been here once before, but thought I would come back today for a sandwich.  Unfortunately, I had a less than favorable experience.    A lady, who I assume to be the owner, was reprimanding her employees in front of me.  This made it extremely uncomfortable for me to sit here an listen.  She yelled at 2 different people, regarding different issues.  One of the issues (which did not bother me) She used my transaction as an example of what \"Not\" to do.  All I wanted to do was get my sandwich and get out of there.  This fruit barn prefers cash payment, and I only had enough on me to cover my sandwich.  I was looking around to see what I could come back to buy later.  Because of this experience, I don't think I will return.    A word of advise in customer service:  Never yell at your employees in front of the customer"}
{"text":"Summers in Phoenix... So great, all year around!  I come to Phoenix a couple times a year on business, and one of a handful of things I do, without fail, is come to Summers Fruit Barn. If I'm having a rough week, just going there is relaxing to me. It is, essentially, an old, classic roadside attraction that offers some amazing stuff.  The place has been there as long as I can remember, way back when Baseline Road was quite rural, and now that the area is growing up all around it, I really hope Summers stays. My trips to the area would be incomplete without a stop by to pick up some goodies.  Great people, simple style, excellent seasonal collection. Cash is best, but not required.  I saw \"K. D.'s\" review, said he returned honey. But over on Google, Kabir Duggal (same person) griped about returning bread. Methinks Kabir has a personal problem with Summers, I'd take that review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Been there three times. Usually prices were more expensive than grocery store, but variety and quality did not compensate for the difference. A lot of shelve space dedicated to honey. Citrus lacked sweetness and did not stay as fresh as is typical (I previously lived in a house that had 4 mature citrus trees). Interactions with staff and management was not welcoming."}
{"text":"We had seen Summers Fruit Barn quite a few times on the way to South Mountain last year, unfortunately it was closed each time. When we were in the area again, we saw it open so immediately we turned around to go by. It's actually quite a bit bigger than expected with many varieties of citrus fruits & honeys for sale along with some other other produce and various packaged good. As we were walking around an employee who came by was a bit rude but he offered us some samples of oranges/grapefruit/etc. He seemed a bit pushy and we had to say a few times, \"thank you, we are going to look around to see what we want.\" The fruits seemed fresh & the prices were pretty much as expected so we bought a few things. The people at the front weren't all that pleasant either. The older lady was rude and was talking to us but didn't make any eye contact. We were asking her regarding what seasonal items are offered / when they'd be there. She was dismissive & not all that helpful. I left with the impression that they don't care about repeat customers - If I were driving by I may stop in because, as previously mentioned the prices are good but I see no reason to drive out of the way to return."}
{"text":"Great place to do some local and fresh shopping. The ladies are extremely friendly. All products and produce are reasonably priced. Definitely will be come by again."}
{"text":"Loved it! It was very decently priced and the fruit was fresh and locally grown. I bought 3 apples, 3 ears of sweet corn, and 3 big tomatoes for a grand total of $4. I was also impressed by the quality and variety they have there. Will definitely be buying my fruit there whenever I'm nearby.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the lady at the register was on the phone the whole time I was checking out. She was otherwise very nice, just distracted."}
{"text":"The country store vibe and very friendly service makes shopping here for fresh produce, nuts, dates, preserves, and other items a really fun experience. Fresh fruit samples are offered so you know beforehand how your purchases will taste. Many items here make great gifts, especially for people who are hard to find gifts for. For example, you can get different kinds of syrups (toasted pecan, blackberry, peach, etc.), different kinds of honey, desert lemon marmalade and cactus jelly to make a sweet gift basket. Stop by and treat yourself to heirloom tomatoes, organic citrus, and other locally grown produce. It's worth the stop if you find yourself in the area; and even if you're farther away, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a hike up south mountain! Warm friendly people selling delicious fresh fruit that you can sample. Got a chicken salad sandwich and fresh fruit smoothie! The chicken salad was to die for, and the smoothie was the perfect consistency made with all fresh ingredients! Delicious. Found my new after hike stop!"}
{"text":"Strongly recommend.  Owner operator with 41 years in the business.  Definitely stop and visit when you are in town."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised by the high reviews of this place.  I live very close by and have been twice.  Both times I was less than impressed.  I was super excited when we moved it to have such a cool thing - a roadside fruit barn near by.  Both times I went the service was HORRIBLY slow.  The place felt hot and there were flies everywhere.  I found the quality of the product to be bad as well."}
{"text":"Driving along Baseline and there is this little gem on a cold winter day. I see red pepper rhistras and I must stop! I have been on a mission to adorn my home in something red and southwestern since being home and not in the skies this year to celebrate the season. I see small ones, medium ones, LARGE red peppers dried and hanging brightly from Summers Fruit Barn! Who knew a girl from California who spends her days and nights in the clouds could get so excited over hanging red peppers?! Well. I can. I scrambled in and was made a 'deal'! I wanted two small for my carriage lights outside my garage and one red pepper wreath for my door! These rhistras are pretty pricy, if you can find them in various sizes like this, anywhere else. I got all three for a bargain! Since I was there, I walked around and was amazed at the fresh fruits, nuts, honey, jams and jellies, pickled things here and there! I ended up buying a lot more than just the red peppers! They had samples of citrus and a grapefruit known as 'blanca' that I had not ever tasted. This reminded me of growing up in a rural area where you get to sample the fruit before you buy! I love it! The staff is helpful, fun, friendly and these kind of little gems just don't exist that much anymore. One tip, pay cash and save the credit/debit card usage fee of a dollar."}
{"text":"I've got something of a love affair with this place. It's becoming a regular part of my life now... and I am okay with that.  In the past, I would go here for lunch... their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Given that I now work about 25 miles from here, that's somewhat... difficult. So instead I now go here after my early morning South Mountain hikes. Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well. I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been \"heaven in our mouths.\"  On top of that, their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled. Delicious fresh fruit (of which they're usually handing out samples), local honey, locally made salad dressings, salsas, jams, and much much more, make this place to die for. I get all of my best fruit here, without a doubt.  One thing to note though is that you should bring cash here! There is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card, as it's expensive for them to process."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in South Phoenix among the other fruit and flower stands it is real nice to see at least one survivor. Summers does offer a great variety of products that are unique and some of which you will not find in your local Fry's or Safeway. The thing I did find odd is that they resold Kirkland raisin bread with a Alpine breads sticker over the Kirkland logo. The only thing that really bothered me was the lack of patience and respect Mrs. Summers had for the two young men working there at the time I was there. Since I am sure she will read this and may ever post a rebuttal I would like to say you have a charming produce stand, delicious fresh squeezed orange juice and I hope you stay in business for many many years to come as your business is one of the last displays of South Phoenix original culture. The only reason I did not rate you higher is because when you made your lack of respect for your employees blatantly apparent in front of me it made me not want to support your business. As someone with a Bachelors of Science in Business and Minors in Management and Small Business Development, you are only as good as your employees and your employees will only be as good as you treat them. I wish Summer's Fruit Barn the best of luck!"}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting local business so when my children wanted pumpkins to carve; I thought why not buy from Summers Fruit Barn instead of a major chain store. I figured the price for pumpkins between both stores would be comparable. Boy....was I wrong as my children and I got to the registered to pay; Summers Fruit Barn wanted $22 for only THREE pumpkins when every major chain store was selling them for $4 or less each. I told the owners the current pricing from other stores and their response was that the sores sell pumpkins so cheap so a customer would be enticed to spend more money at that particular store.   So I went to Sprouts and purchased three large organic pie pumpkins as well fresh chicken, greens, and bread for all under $22."}
{"text":"This place is a little wacky...  but there's no better place on the south side to get a sandwich,   and when the season's right there's nowhere cheaper to buy berries,  avocados, or other short season fruits.    Be aware that there is an upcharge for using a credit card here,   best to bring paper cash if you want the best deal."}
{"text":"Love this place .... They have the best fruits ... Really sweet and less expensive too !!!"}
{"text":"Although I live nowhere near Summers, I happened to notice their produce stand on the way to an event at the Humane Society, so I stopped on my way home.  Lots of produce, of course, and a good selection of pickled and canned items as well.  I found the staff to be so friendly, offering samples of a few different fruits and even going to the trouble to point out that they had less expensive lemons than the locally grown variety I was purchasing.  Both varieties of dates I purchased were excellent, although, why do they have to look like big 'ole cockroaches?  Can't someone engineer a more attractive fruit?  Anyhow, definitely worth a stop if you live in the neighborhood.  Keep in mind their prices are for cash payment.  Using a card will cost you more, but I'm not sure how much."}
{"text":"Great fruit and I like their packaged trail mix.  A lot of salsa, honey and other local treats.  Only negatives- Owner and customer service a little pushy and no sign posted about 5% fee on using debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting your local farms but this place is a joke. Cashier has no clue what good customer service is and the owner makes no apologies for nickel-and-diming their customers. And their not smart enough to post a sign that they charge $1.00 for debit/credit cards so not only do you not get my $1, you do not get my business.  Also, read through the reviews...you will see other customers feel the same about their terrible customer service and the owner's reply is always rude. I'll gladly take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Poor horrible quality! Half of the things are at the end of their shelf life and some are even beyond that- basically some of the things are already gone bad that they are selling. Good luck returning things as the old lady will go psycho on you and start screaming...haha what a joke! I feel pity for them and anyone who might get an experience like I did when i tried to return honey that they sold me which was already bad, probably due to poor temperature control they have in their shop.  In summers they rely on air coolers and you can imagine AZ 110 degree days. You would feel like you just walked in a oven.... The old lady (owner) is rude and has no etiquettes of how to deal with a customer....I would recommend never walk into that shop or learn from your own bad experience. I wasted my time, money and had bad experience that is going to stick with me for quite some time. Feel bad for other single owners as she is representing them in the worst possible way. For the first time I realized some of the good things that big chains offer. Sorry for being so verbose...but she made us and my wife real upset!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I wish I had found it before our last day and on the way to the airport. This place has fresh fruits and nuts and breads. There are a bunch of samples and quite a good selection of items. The staff is also very nice. We picked up a loaf of pumpkin bread as a thank you for our ride from the airport once we got home. I think they liked it, I know we loved our samples.   If you are in the area, I definitely would go in to this place. I think it is probably a bit more than the market, but the produce is very fresh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to visit for some delicious fruit, sandwiches, and incredibly friendly people. Upon entering, the staff will offer you free samples of the fruit they have to offer. I enjoy picking up local or organic fruits and vegetables and supporting the last remaining fruit stand left along Baseline Rd. Before the push to build along South Mountain, there were several others that lined the street. When the City of Phoenix widened the road, they took away the left hand turn to make it easily into the parking lot. I refuse to let such an inconvenience keep me from a place that I share with all of my friends, when I can get the chance. If you want to support a local business, experience real hospitality, and find something delicious to eat then I highly recommend Summers Fruit Barn."}
{"text":"For years, I have been shopping at \"the fruit barn\" (my name for it.). It's about 15 minutes away from my house so I have been extremely inconsistent in making it my go to place for produce... Until recently.  I have been making it a conscious decision to get nearly all of my produce here now. I also buy my bread, raw honey, and dates here. Why do I make the extra effort? Because the fruit barn is that incredible. Here are just a few examples of why I love this place...  1. The staff is über friendly. Anyone who says otherwise either came on an off day or a super busy time.  2. The prices are incredible. Some of the prices may be comparable to grocery stores, but never higher AND a lot of the prices are MUCH lower.   3. It is a small local business. I love that I get to support this business and they are providing my family the best quality products they can. Grocery stores don't do that.  4. After I shop there, I feel happy. Sounds crazy right?!? Have you ever been to Walmart? You know how you feel when you leave there... frustrated, exhausted, like you never want to go back? This is the exact opposite. In fact, I often call my husband to tell him how much I love the fruit barn when I am on my way home from there.  So if you have the luxury of living nearby (or just being nearby), go there. You will get some great produce at fantastic prices and you may just leave happier.  And if possible bring CASH.  They do accept credit and debit cards, but charge slightly higher prices if not paying with cash or check."}
{"text":"Not going to pretend to be a vegan but we happened upon this place looking for some fruit. Instead of just going to a supermarket, we tried this place. Very friendly and found different fruit butters you wouldn't normslly see at those other stores. Free samples for the win!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.... Prices were steep for most items that were packaged... And I was an audience for the owners family fight right in front of me. They don't have smoothies anymore nor do they care about customer service at all... Total disappointment"}
{"text":"Family run and locally grown fruit barn yay! I love this place, I stop in about once a week on my way home from work. They always have great specials on fruit, steals actually. You can tell by the taste they are not pumped full of hormones and preservatives. Delicious. My favorite part, they are so friendly and greet you at the doors with a sample of fresh fruit (ever tried a blood orange?).  They also have fresh baked breads. They are so delicious it takes all the strength I have not to eat an entire loaf in one day. Favorites I have tried, cinnamon raison, banana and the lemon suck your fingers afterwards icing.. YUM! They also make sandwiches, $5 bucks including chips and a coke. This place is great, the staff is friendly and the fruit is fresh and delicious. Bring cash or a check though because they charge you $1 to use a debit card."}
{"text":"How often do you see fruit stands on the roadside anymore? Not much in Phoenix. But Summer's Fruit Barn serves that role excellently, as Lisa the owner has maintained relationships throughout the area to get fresh fruits and veggies, as well as other goodies, at great prices. On my last visit she even taught me how to sort through the huge batches of AZ sweet oranges (the reason for my visit, looking on behalf of a friend). She peeled a few to demonstrate how to spot light to moderate frost damage, and then hand selected a few pounds of her best specimens. I love having this place nearby."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Everything is fresh. Many people are used to fruit being sprayed with wax to make it look shiny etc. I have grown up around fruit trees and this is how real fruit looks. I was able to get a couple free samples. You can even eat the skins because they are naturally good. You can't do that with store bought GMO fruit. I was even able to see blood oranges. Yes I will be back. They even take checks."}
{"text":"The Sandwich Shop @ Summer Fruit Barn is a great place to stop-by when in South Phoenix. Locally owned and the tuna sandwich was awesome. Ingredients are fresh and served with a smile."}
{"text":"For anyone who lives in the South Mountain area or South Tempe, this a conveniently-located, family-owned produce stand, bakery, and sandwich shop that features fresh, locally-owned ingredients and really friendly people. My husband stopped there for a sandwich the other day - for only ~$5, he got a turkey sandwich, chips, and a beverage. He said that the meat wasn't great quality, but that the freshly-baked bread was phenomenal. He told me that they had a great selection of dates and figs (my favorite appetizers to make are bacon-wrapped dates and figs with blue cheese, but I always have a hard time finding them, especially figs), so I went back the other day to see their selection for myself.   The woman working greeted me with a smile, asked if I needed help, and offered me a sample of fresh watermelon (it was so juicy and sweet!). I told her I was looking for figs - unfortunately, they didn't have any fresh black ones, but they had some bagged white ones which I haven't been able to find at Fry's or Fresh & Easy. The price was pretty high ($4.50), but I didn't mind, since I knew they would be really fresh and that I would be supporting a family-run business and local growers. Plus, I already had the blue cheese and wanted to make my appetizer!   The only drawback of my experience was the $1.00 transaction fee they charged for paying with debit card. They had a little disclaimer up about being a family-run establishment, and I do understand that the economy's bad, but the fee is really high, even compared to mom-and-pop restaurants in the area. Well, when all was said and done, the figs were delicious, and I am excited to go back and try some more of their produce and baked goods."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  I had no idea it was down here but as I was driving back to downtown from Tempe I noticed the chili peppers hanging outside.  Since my mom was looking for a strand, i made a U-turn and went back.  It is full of locally grown produce and a ton of locally made breads, jams, and other things.  It is a totally awesome place and is actually 100x better than the Phx Public Market store.  This is everything that the market should be.  I wish it wasn't so far away but I will be back as soon as I get over there."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  I'm in line to make a purchase and I overhear someone say Barrett Jackson. I ask who the hush hush celebrity is supposed to be today and the cashier yells out Trump!  I ask did she just say Donald Trump and she yells out to everyone I love Donald Trump!  So I put my stuff on her counter and say. I'm not buying anything here she yells out I'm glad you said that! It's not the fact that she loves Trump it's the fact she treated me poorly because I am anti-Trump! And if she was not on the clock that would've been one thing and we could've had a discussion. She was behind the counter waiting on customers and she had no idea who I was. Yes I did say some choice words!"}
{"text":"So very disappointing!  I bought a TON of citrus from here, and it all turned bad within 24 hours.  Actual mold.  The beets that I bought from here were amazing and well priced though.  So 2 stars for the beets, NO stars for the citrus.  :(  They are friendly though."}
{"text":"I don't know if the lady was a owners or just a worker but she was rude. We bought bread but there was a misunderstanding about the pick up time. I guess we missed the time to pick up the bread. Which is fine that was our mistake but the lady at the register had a big-o heart attack and was acting like if we were lying and trying to steal bread. We explained that we paid in advance for the bread and now we were here to pick it up. She called over another lady that recognized us and that lady said they had to throw that bread out because we did not come at the pick up time. Again which is fine because that is our mistake. I just didn't like how the lady at the register  treated us like thieves and caused a scene. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable. After that we never  went back and that's a shame because I love supporting small business."}
{"text":"My only real complaint is they're not open year round. They are open while the seasonal fruits and vegetables they sell are fresh and in season which makes perfect sense. They also have lots of fruit spreads, marmalades, jellies, honeys, nuts, treats, juices, and more.  Friendly staff (I haven't run into the grumpy staff other people seem to have), good prices, and fresh product. I also haven't run into the spoilage at least one other person mentioned.  I haven't tried this, but I understand they ship products so you can share Arizona's bounty with friends and family out of state."}
{"text":"This was a pretty awesome place.  We were driving home along Baseline (not sure why) when the husband noticed a string of chili peppers alongside the road.  We turned around to go get some because of a special request from his mom, and proceeded to check out the rest of the store.    It was so awesome inside!  It gave me a pleasant little reminder of what the Olympia Farmer's Market was like.  There was beautiful, fragrant, fresh fruit everywhere!  There were loaves of fresh baked breads and rows of jars full of honey or yummy preserves.  It was almost an assault on my eyes with all the color flying around in here, but I loved it.  As we checked out at the counter, the girl was pretty funny, telling us that if the peppers started to fade in color we could just spray paint it, but to not eat it afterwards.  I also bought a bunch of prickly pear fruits that I plan on using in lemon bars later.  The prices in the store are pretty cheap, especially considering what I assume to be high quality  local produce."}
