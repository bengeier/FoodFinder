{"text":"I'm a little tentative giving a brand new business a rating - and one that I keep fluctuating on, but I'll give it a go.

Union Wine Bar & Grill is located in downtown Scottsdale and occupies what I think used to be Borders Burgers. Now, when folks think wine bar in Phoenix, they think something along the lines of Cheuvront, Lisa G, Kazimierz, Postino, etc. Well, Union is different. I'd actually emphasize that it's more \"grill\" than \"wine bar\" - at least that's the vibe it gives off. Not that there's anything wrong with that (TM Seinfeld). 

It's a fairly big space, with half booths spread all over (where one side sits on cushy leather while the other side...doesn't). The way they have their wine displayed is pretty cool, but wine is far from the most prominent feature in the restaurant, which has a casual southwestern motif and random radio-friendly rock music playing (U2, Coldplay, Matchbox 20, etc.). The crowd definitely skews older, which is actually refreshing. It's not trying to be another lame Scottsdale scenester venue. Just people enjoying a casual night out with their friends. If there was a fake rack in the vicinity, it must have been camouflaged really well because I didn't spot any.

Foodwise this place specializes in small plates from a variety of influences. I'd say the food was pretty good, but nothing blew my socks off. Then again, I only tried a handful of the dishes (including the sausage & polenta). 

Our server was friendly, conversational, and efficient with all our orders, and the host was really courteous and didn't mind at all that I wandered all over the restaurant and then back outside wondering where all my (late) friends were. 

So putting pieces together in a puzzle, I'm torn how to rate this place. It's not a joint I'm jumping to head back to right this minute. That said, if someone mentioned heading out to Scottsdale and heading here, I'd definitely consider driving on over and trying out more of the food (and the vino, which I didn't partake in last time). I don't think Union Wine Bar will be featured on dirtyscottsdale.com anytime soon, so rest easy.

So 3.7-something stars - rounding up to 4."}
{"text":"This place is really a breath of fresh air in Old Town Scottsdale. 

Quick observations:
* Side street location keeps it from the Old Town riff raff.
* I really like their presentation of the wine flights in the little mobile wire contraption.
* I didn't order any food here, so I can speak to that.
* Attentive service.
* I felt the atmosphere was a little blah. 

It's a rather large dining room with an open kitchen to one side (love open kitchens). When Bonnie and I were debating the look and decor of the place we decided on Levitz or Mor Furniture for Less.  Think boring Southwestern chaise test patterns for seating and stylized Sedona landscape paintings for art. Ick!  An article in the Arizona Republic even said the owners were puzzled as to why they kept getting the Wisconsin 40-something crowd - and well they should wonder no further. 

Other than that I really enjoyed my wine - rieslings and a sauvignon blanc, noshed on marinated olives and mixed nuts and enjoyed the company of random Yelpers. Our server was pretty attentive and checked up on us often and with each new person who arrived. 

If you're not too concerned with the generic suburban atmosphere you might like this wine bar.  But if you want a sophisticated sexy wine bar feel, you're better off at Tapino, Postino or Kazimierz.   I liked it, but I'm not in a huge rush to go back, and definitely can't sing praises like I could of the aforementioned places."}
{"text":"Union is a nice cozy place set on the fringe of Old Town Scottsdale.  The inside has a nice homey feel with booths that have extra throw pillows (love that) and soft lighting and desert scape paintings.  A big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen.  

The wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places.  The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form.  They do offer 8 oz pours of wine for about $15 a glass.  Be careful when you order, as we were given 8oz pours and had no idea we were getting them.  

The food was quite good, they actually had real grilled focaccia and this garlic cream butter that was delicious.  Its tapas style and we ordered three and it was more than enough for the two of us. All of the tapas we ordered were well prepared. We also ordered dessert which was very mediocre.  

I would come back again but probably for a happy hour.  As far as food goes it wasn't my favorite at a wine bar.  They do have a patio out front that looks like it would be very cozy on a cool evening."}
