{"text":"If you are ordering from the Papa John's up the street, hit yourself. This is the best pizza shop in a neighborhood chock full of them. I highly recommend the calzones, not like any I had ever had before.   Some people may dab the grease off the top with a napkin, but I won't judge.   I had never thought boners and skins could be so pleasing. And only for $11! Brothers, you cease to amaze."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Love the sauce! They are always fast at delivering, never cold either!We order from them once a week and if we are having a party we order wings and pizza. Their sandwiches are outstanding also!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a chef salad during a short stop at BKL. (Short drive, and the Landmark people were happy to drive me over). I ended up with some desserts too. Everything was of extremely high quality, and the staff very nice."}
{"text":"Great food and unique menu items. The deep fried pierogi were phenomenal. Lunch specials can't be beat with a stick. $5 for a ton of food. Staff is always friendly. Go here at least twice a week. West park gem."}
{"text":"Driven by this place hundreds of times and decided to finally stop in. The building is nothing to write home about but the pizza was outstanding!  Great flavors with the ingredients they use sets them apart from the larger national chains. Staff was friendly and polite.   I would have taken a picture but I ate it too fast. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Every time I've ordered from Brothers they either took over an hour and a half to deliver or the food never showed up. I live on Edgewater in Lakewood...not sure how they aren't able to deliver our food within a reasonable amount of time. Will not try again for delivery - dine in will be next, and hopefully a better experience."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, the pizza was okay; but it wasn't a true thin-crust style pizza (such as New York, Neapolitan, Margherita, etc). It reminded more of a good NY-style Sicilian. That said, the bread, cheese, and sauce came together for a good bite.  I ordered via delivery, and though it took a while (it was late at night), the estimated delivery time was accurate. The delivery driver was courteous and the pizza was still nice and hot when I got it.  The online ordering system and webpage are excellent and very convenient, and kudos to the owners of Brothers Pizza for setting up such a great system.  I am only visiting in Cleveland for a couple of weeks, but I am sure I will eat at Brothers Pizza again."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Said it would be an hour to get here and took over two hours! Food was cold. Order was wrong."}
{"text":"We have always loved Brothers pizza since we moved to West park and now that I can order online soooo easily thru the Yelp app makes me very happy!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza!!! In a city with tons of pizza shops Brothers stands out! Great sauce, fresh toppings, creative specialties, and great customer service!   Try it and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Looove all their pizza! I've had their plain pepperoni, BBQ chicken,  buffalo chicken, smashed potato, and mac n cheese. I thought the mac n cheese was even better than Danny Boys! And I love the BBQ more than any other BBQ I've ever tried! The smashed potato was even better than I thought it would be too."}
{"text":"On a glowing recommendation from a friend I ordered Brothers Pizza for delivery.  I loved the ease and convenience of online ordering, and the menu had much to choose from. I decided on a pan pizza with traditional sauce, roasted red peppers, fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, and red onions.   The delivery was prompt and friendly. Our pizza was relatively hot for a delivery to Lakewood from Rocky River.  I felt that the toppings were especially meager for a buck each, and our roasted red peppers were just raw red peppers. The pizza was way underbaked and soggy, the crust was white at the bottom.   I feel I need to add that my dining partner wanted to order again today; obviously he enjoyed it!  I think that for a late night pie they'll do fine, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak and cheese sub and buffalo chicken and it was delivered on time and delicious!!! Will order again"}
{"text":"Before I came here, I heard about the \"Roma\" pizza... Their take on a romanburger pizza... It was everything I had expected! In addition, I also got to try their buffalo chick'n pizza... The homemade sauce is amazing! Very, very good pizza!"}
{"text":"We only ordered from here because Athen's was closed.  We got a meatball sub and a pizza. The pizza looked yummy, but looks can be deceiving. I ate 1 piece and the rest went right in the trash. It had a terrible aftertaste that took hours to go away. Never again."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Online ordering! Fast, friendly service! Huge menu"}
{"text":"Ok well i like the pizza. Brothers has a good thing going but sometimes they are not the best getting your order correct. We had a bad botched order were promised a full reorder next time on them with delivery by the manager themselves. Yeah no we ended up getting one free thing delivered by someone who parked in my neighbors drive...good pizza so so customer service my pie friends"}
{"text":"We ordered today for lunch at work and were delivered an inedible, hockey puck of a burger and a chicken and cheese quesadilla covered in tomatoes. When I called for a refund I was told that we couldn't have our money back, only a credit or new food. We were going to take new food, but the whole exchange with the condescending owner put a bad taste in our mouth. We took the credit that will never be used. Never ordering again. They need to review their refund policy."}
{"text":"2 hours after ordering I finally receive a cold pizza and warm salads. The manager doesnt seem like she has much experience. Not very apologetic nor wanted to give a discount when i called an hour and 30 minutes after i placed my order. All anyone wanted to say to me was your order is on the way. I will never order again and experiences like this make me never want to try anyone new. I will stick with nunzios from now on"}
{"text":"Things to get- Smashed Potato Pizza, Garlic Parmesan Wings, BRO-ROGIES! Brothers pizza is one of my all time favorite delivery places!"}
{"text":"First time getting brothers pizza and we got the veggie pizza. Pizza was delicious minus one little setback, finding a bread tie in the pizza. Now I understand its Christmas eve and they were busy but I'm pretty sure no one else found a bread tie in there pizza tonight."}
{"text":"Brothers Pizza can be really upsetting. It's the kind of place that can make AMAZING DELICIOUS PIZZA straight from a \"mom and pops\" looking kitchen. Yet on the other hand, it takes forever, and I mean...FOREVER to get it. I usually stop by in from my night job sometimes if I don't want to cook at home, and if I'm lucky I hope I'd have a 40 minute wait. It takes a long time, and sometimes its just one person working on all the orders. That place really needs a second hand in there. I'll keep this one updated if anything changes in the future.  Edit: revised, the Cleveland location moved down a bit towards Kamm's Corner. It took 20 minutes, it was far better experience than previous. Upped to 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here numerous times. The pizza has always been good. I've gotten their hand made pierogies which were very good too. The last time we ordered from there my husband order boneless wings & they have us regular. I ordered a burger which was so overcooked it was hard to chew & was completely flavorless. There was ZERO juices in the meat. I was really disappointed, I couldn't even eat half of it. We picked up the order which they said would be about 25 mins & when my husband went to pick up after 25 minutes he had to wait another 15 because they hadn't finished the order. Stick with the pizza, I've never been disappointed in the pizza."}
{"text":"had brothers for first time.  Delivery was fast.  Food was hot, order was complete.  Pizza was tasty.  The ONLY comment that I have is that the sauce they use on pizza needs a little work.  When I say this I mean its a little thick and \"pasty\".  if they loosen the sauce a bit this pizza would be excellent.. also tried a burger....little thick and sort of tasteless(meat) but descent.  pros:  fast, complete delivery.  taste of pizza was good   Con: burger meat was thick and sort of tasteless.  sauce needs work  would I go back?  Yes"}
{"text":"Just had my bbq pizza delivered.. the driver was super nice and I thought I was going to get a regular ole pizza... This is the best pizza I have eaten!! Been all over the world and the food here is fantastic!! Just moved back to the area and I found my new favorite place! !"}
{"text":"Brothers Pizza catered a company lunch for me.  I am giving this place five stars because I do not have one single complaint.  Not only did they give me a killer deal for 15 pizzas and hundreds of wings, the food was top notch and I received excellent customer service throughout the whole thing.  Delivery was on time, hot, and they even helped me set up!  We had a wide variety of the specialty pizzas and they were ALL good!  The Smac' and Cheese was recommended by someone there and they were right!  This was the hit of the lunch...everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"Not good.  The pizza had little cheese and none at all on some parts.  The crust also engulfed half of the slice sometimes.  Very disappointing to me."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a LONG time.  Great crust - slightly sweet dough paired nicely with the Spicy Italian's sauce.  Ordered with extra cheese and they delivered.  Talked to the owner a bit - he said everything was hand made from scratch daily - dough, sauce, etc.  It sure tasted it!  The onions and tomatoes on the pie were uber fresh and bursting with flavor.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun and adventurous specialty pizza and when you are building your own pizza with only one or two items, the pizza's come with a generous amount of cheese & fresh hand cut veggies. The crust is great and the sauce is tasty! They are open late, which is also quite a plus in my book!  I got the two for $20 last night with both pizza's having mushrooms as an item and I was beyond happy to see a liberal helping of FRESH, hand sliced mushrooms being prepared for my pizza. When we got the pizza's home and opened the boxes my guests as well as myself were very impressed with the amount of cheese on both pies! I don't even want to know what a double cheese pizza looks like!  Having tried 4 or 5 different specialty pizza's as well as making my own with two items, I must say that Brothers is my new favorite pizza shop and I wish them the best of luck! Between the great tastes, fair prices, and fantastic hours, Brothers Pizza covers all the bases of a fine pizza joint!"}
{"text":"We found Brothers on yelp at 1am after a long night of partying and it was the only place still open and willing to deliver food. It was great and we've been faithful customers ever since! Everything is delicious and all the employees are incredibly nice. Online ordering is very convenient. LOVE them."}
{"text":"I ordered the calzone and the loaded fries.  The meat calzone was loaded with meat and not as greasy as I would expect considering what was in it. The fries were selfish and the toppings were not scarce! I will be ordering the calzone again for sure and looking forward to trying a different one next time.  It was HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"Love Brothers Pizza!  The pizza is so stinkin good! Crispier crust. A nice sweet sauce. And great toppings!  And the price is really reasonable. They also have great lunch specials.   The guys who work there are great also!  I'm willing to spend my money there.   Only problem. Last time they messed up my order. I wanted ham and pineapple... But I received ham and onion :( But still. They are awesome!"}
{"text":"Our pup's vet is beside Brothers and it always smells amazing when we go in. So we thought we'd give it a whirl. We ordered a large pepperoni mushrooms and buffalo wings crispy. Excellent!!!! We are pizza connoisseurs!!! Great wings too. The ranch is homemade and yummy. Definitely making this a Usual for us. Thanks for the great service guys!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious - hungry on the way home from the airport! Friendly and convenient spot. It was ready between the time we walked out of the airport and could drive there - amazing! My husband is also extremely impressed with the flavor and crust. Exactly what you're looking for when you're craving pizza in my opinion. This is sure to become our post-airport spot."}
{"text":"Best pizza place to go after a night out.  Foosball table provides plenty of entertainment while the pizza cooks. Get the smashed!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I can't seem to figure out why we torture ourselves with mediocre food when we're feeling lazy. Yet we did it again with Brothers Pizza. We ordered the Brogies, the Smack and Cheese, cheesy bread, and a Chicken Parm sandwich. So let's start with the Brogies. I figured when I was ordering perogies from somewhere in Cleveland that it was a safe bet. Wrong. Very wrong. First, they are deep fried. In their defense, it did note this on the menu. Second, as I got to my third of the five in the container I realized that what I thought was cheese was really raw dough. So I tried another one in hopes that it was a fluke. Lo and behold, this one also had raw dough. I didn't even bother trying the next one. Next, I ordered my smack and cheese with chorizo on it. They claim it's got all sorts of cheese in it, but what it appeared to be upon opening the to go container was a bunch of cooked elbows that had some cheese thrown on top and thrown into the broiler. There was barely any cheese sauce under this initial layer on top. My husband says his chicken parm was \"meh\" at best. It wasn't something he would order again. He only managed to get down half of it. The star of the entire meal would have had to have been the cheesy bread. It was the only truly edible thing we got. I can't say I'll be ordering again in the future. One of the reasons we ordered from here was because we just didn't want to wait the extra hour for another business that I won't name."}
{"text":"Several incorrect orders, always slow, terrible customer service and subpar food.  Will not be ordering from here ever again."}
{"text":"A friend brought a chicken bacon ranch pizza to a meeting and it was delish. Adding a star because the new location is great and in appreciation of all their specialty pizzas (since my original review I've tried a bbq and the chicken bacon ranch- both much better than their traditional tomato sauced pizzas which I am still not personally a fan of...)"}
{"text":"Not a fan!  Food is ok, if your choices are limited.  Cinnamon sticks weren't worth it."}
{"text":"Some bull apps says 4 miles away so i was out of the service area yea for delivery yea right. Wont eat here ever now!"}
{"text":"Anytime I want delivery but not pizza, I now order from here. The mac & cheese is super super cheesy & creamy. Their ranch is homemade so I always order extra. I usually get the teriyaki boneless wings. Their menu says they have celery but be warned: they don't so you won't get any. Their burgers are fresh beef & not frozen (I can tell from the taste) so they're really good & juicy. I was told by the delivery guy that they don't fry anything so if you order fries or mozz sticks, they'll be baked. I've had the hot Italian sub, cheesy bread, grilled chicken sandwich, potato skins, mozz sticks, etc. & It's ALL good. Just get extra ranch! ;)"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering here. I am an avid pizza eater. Pizza and wings all day. The food got to my house still HOT! I ordered the meat lovers and ranchers buffalo wings. Wings had plenty of sauce and not dry. Just how it should be. Great job on my first order. Hope to get the same experiences on my future orders."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I absolutely love the food from brothers. Always has been my favorite pizza place in Cleveland. Food is phenomenal.   However tonight when I ordered my delivery several items were forgotten. All just sides or sauces, but still when a customer pays extra for something please don't forget it!!!!  But again food is great. Smashed potato pizza is a must!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Delivery times were a bit slow. Overall its pizza, they deliver, and it tastes good."}
{"text":"I'm 5.5 miles from them and that's too far to deliver to apparently. Literally about a 10 minute drive. If you live in Berea they will not deliver to you. For some reason the residents of Berea are not worthy of their pizza.   At the end of the day the real lesson is... $18 is too much money for a large pizza"}
{"text":"The delivery guy was really nice, but it took a very long time to get to my house, was barely warm when it arrived and wasn't very good. The sauce that came with my cheesesticks was straight out of the fridge cold. There are a lot of pizza options in this neighborhood and I won't be calling Brothers again."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni, mushroom, and black olive pizza. It arrived hot and on time. The sauce was pretty sweet which I don't detest but it's not my favorite, and the crust was a bit  too thick for me. The cheese and the toppings were pretty good. I also got an order of hot wings, which were pretty good. Nothing special about them but they weren't soggy or anything. I thought it strange that I could order blue cheese with my wings but they wouldn't sell me celery. My biggest problem was with the order itself. I wanted a small pizza and I got a large. I probably should have paid more attention to the price but I wasn't all that concerned, I was really hungry and my mind wasn't functioning properly.  I think I'll try them again as they do have an extensive sandwich menu and I love a good meatball sub."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza. Two hours later I finally got it. It was freezing cold. I called the store to tell them and she hung up on me. I had to call back a fourth time and told them they could have their pizza back and I demanded a refund.  No thanks"}
{"text":"Ordering online was super convenient. Delivery took almost an hour, which was ok, but not super speedy. Delivery girl was nice, but you would think if they are delivering to a hotel room, they would assume that you don't have dishes, utensils, and napkins available. We had to eat out of the boxes with our hands and use hotel towels as napkins. The crust was yummy, the marinara was the sweetest I've ever tasted, like someone accidentally spilled too much sugar in it.  Sweet potato fries were very good but \"sour cream sauce\" was weird.  If I lived here, I might give them one more try before deciding whether I liked it or not."}
{"text":"I'm staying at a hotel nearby, and was given this menu as a place worthy of ordering from.  First time I called, I got no answer.  Phone went to voicemail.  Second time I called, I got no answer.  Phone went to voicemail.  Checked the menu again.  Yeah, hours are right.  Yeah, phone number is right.  Third time I called, someone picked up the phone and then hung it back up immediately.  Fourth time I called, I called a different restaurant.  Food delivered, problem solved.  Sorry, Brothers.  You lost money tonight."}
