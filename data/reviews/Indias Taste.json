{"text":"NOT A 1 STAR BUT YELP WON'T ACCEPT A NO STAR!!! Saw this new restaurant in our regular travels a free weeks ago. Surprisingly not a lot of Indian restaurants in the NW corner of Mississauga so wanted to give it a shot.  In the neighborhood again today at 13:00 so decided to stop in. Parking lot was full but the lot is small. Lots of other stores in the area so plenty of parking available. Got to the door and was immediately greeted by who I am assuming was the hostess. Without asking us one single question she abruptly informed us that they currently had 4 parties on the go and would not accommodate us (even though there were a few others waiting to be seated). Without so much as an apology or even giving us a chance to say a word she told us to try back after 15:00. Funny thing was we were only a party of two and the restaurant is a buffet.  Needless to say we will not be returning after 15:00 or at anytime for that matter. There are way too many new places to enjoy without having to put up with the lousy attitude or the poor customer service. Considering this is a chain of restaurants perhaps management should review who they hire to greet prospective customers ($$$$).  A big fat zero (my first) for this review.  Can't wait to see who opens there next when this place shuts down."}
{"text":"Lot of options for buffet. Good thing is they have all day buffet. Service is very good. Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Was charged Dinner Buffet Price.  I thought maybe its because its family day.  But I called to ask the what the price for lunch buffet is. A man answered and then passed it to a woman. Whom i spoke to earlier about my bill. She said it $23.99 whole day.  So i decide to call EVERY franchise listed on the website.  These are the only guys charging $23.99 for lunch.   Markham is 18.99 Bramptom 20.99  Food was good. Place is fancy.  But wouldnt go again!!!  Not when Coke is $3.  And when I paid. I didnt get back all my change. If I had. I would have left a tip.  Also their desserts are in different areas. Ice cream being right by service doors. Awkward.  I will try other locations and let you guys know."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place out and a good sign was that the restaurant was somewhat full despite the harsh winter weather today... At this point I'm thinking 'the food has to be good'... The interior decor and design is very classy and gives you the upscale vibe even for a buffet restaurant, this is a place I could easily see myself hosting a business meeting or business event. They have a lovely selection of North and South Indian non-veg and veg buffet items and also include different types of naan as part of their buffet price... The food quality here is much better than other well known Indian buffets in GTA.  I appreciate the fact that they bring the naan basket to your table however their timing on delivering the naan is way off as they seemed to bring the naan bread by the time we were either done with the curries or by the time the curries went cold, important fact is that they weren't busy at that point.  Speaking of the cold (more like frost), we were seated at a 4 seated booth right in front of the door which left us with either the option to keep our bulky jackets on while eating or shiver to death, the host said she couldn't seat us elsewhere because a portion of the restaurant closes in an hour (btw it's been 1.5 hrs since we've been here and guess what? None of the portions were closed lol). The booth is a bit tight so we opted to shiver each time the door opened in order to be able to move our arms so we could eat :) eventually when I asked the hostess to please close the door they placed a heater. I did really appreciate the gesture!  The dessert was amazing, especially the gulab Jamun and ras malai! I'll most likely return with more people -- With better seats hopefully or else I might return in the summer to enjoy the summer breeze indoors."}
{"text":"Nice new Indian buffet, the place is clean and the dining area is nice and bright. At first, we were not sure if they still accept people in as we waited for a while before anyone came to greed us. But once we got seated, water arrived instantly.   Lots of food choice. The butter chicken is still the only dish I will eat with naan bread. We had to order naan by asking the servers as they make it fresh for you. The kebab and tandoori chicken sitting on the buffet were dry.    Kids from 3 to 6 : $8 Kid from 7 to 10: $12.50  They do have a part room... good place to have large gathering."}
{"text":"Had an office team lunch here. This place is quite new and does not disappoint. Lunch buffet is something like $16. The selection is very nice. They even have lamb ribs and some grilled kebobs. All your standard Indian buffet fare like tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and various curries are there. Naan is made to order.  Some of the meats were a bit dry but that's ok for a buffet. All the curries were great and what I expected in taste. They have some Indian style sweets but also Western style cakes and ice cream. Stick with the Indian ones! That's what you're here for.  Overall it's a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice.  I will focus on our last visit which was on a Saturday night with my wife and daughter.  There was a small crowd there, but there was also a steady take out business.  We were seated promptly and given a fancy bottle of water for the table.  It took me forever and a day to get that !@#$(*& bottle open  My daughter loves butter chicken.  Though finding some rice to go with it was a little tough since she wanted specific rice like the rice at Loblaws across the street.  The butter chicken had moderate spice to it.  I loaded up on a little bit of everything.  We did have to harass the staff to get some Naan Bread  Overall we have enjoyed the place and will repeat!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across Indias Taste with the original intention of going to the kebab restaurant in the same plaza, only to find their seating full. Seeing Indias Taste as an option, and being hungry enough for a buffet, I decided to give it a try.   The waiting staff was very helpful even when I wasn't too sure if I was going to dine there or not. By no means were they forceful; instead, they invited us to have a look around, look at the takeout menu, and answered whatever questions you would normally have when deciding on a place to eat.   After finally settling in on the buffet, the time came to eat. There are definitely plenty of options, with half being vegetarian (and being a meat eater, I didn't really pay close attention to it.) There were a variety of goat, lamb, and chicken curries, along with plenty of items from the grill. The chicken kabobs, lamb vindaloo, the samosas, and paneer tikka really stood out to me. I also had a lot of lamb chops, but would love to see more consistency as some came out really dry and overcooked, whereas others were perfectly fine. Make sure to tell your waiter to bring you some naan as it is made to order (specifically, the garlic naan). I also tried some of the tamarind sauce and found it a perfect compliment to the items on the grill.   An area of improvement would definitely be the desserts. I enjoyed the ras malai, but the cakes are not anything special and did taste a bit stale. Also could be organized a bit better, as some desserts were next to the salads, some next to the vegetarian curries, and some tucked around a corner.  Overall, I found my experience to be enjoyable and I do recommend for you to try it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner buffet. The place is very clean and it was all empty. We were the only ones there. A lot of the food items were already finished and they never bothered topping them off since it was around 8 or 9 in the evening. The buffet was $20.99 and if you want to add a drink it's another $3.  The food had been sitting for quite a while and you could tell it lost its quality due to sitting since the lunch time.  The staff seems to be okay and DO not interrupt your dinner every 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Loved the service - we dined on the patio and had the fortune of having Rabia as our server who was so accommodating , courteous and helpful. Food was great as always - try the dosa and the goat curry it's an absolute must have when you come to this place."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. It is fresh and has a nice selection. I have been many times and notice that there have been some different dishes to try.  The down side is that your favourite dish many not be there. I have a 5 year old who also gives it a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Food is fresh, seating is comfortable and waiters are very attentive (seldom the case at most buffets)."}
{"text":"I went to this location with my family yesterday for Mother's day. I called in the morning and made reservations. Got there at the time we reserved for and it was busy (expected on a day like this). There was another 3 families waiting to be seated as well. We only had to wait 10-15 mins or so which wasn't bad. The one thing I didn't like is that the hostess asked us after 5ish mins if we wanted to sit at the table right in the front by the door. We refused it as there were too many people coming in through the front door but it was weird that she never asked the other family with the same number of people if they wanted it instead. Anyhow! The food was okay. They were missing palak/saag paneer which I think is always a must at an Indian restaurant (really sad about that) but they had a lot of meat options for those who eat meat. I thought the layout of the buffet was kind of odd. The deserts were all over the place and the plates were on the bottoms of the buffet so if theres a line up of people you have to ask someone to move so you can get one. The random desert bar on the side had cakes and custard but they all tasted stale. The gajrela had no sugar in it at all but the mango ice cream was delicious! It might have been too much for them to keep up on this day. I always liked going to their ray lawson location. Maybe i'll just stick to that!"}
