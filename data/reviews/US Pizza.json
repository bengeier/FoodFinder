{"text":"First, the customer service is terrible. I'm always put on hold when I call, the pizza takes over an hour every single time. The food is canned and pre-packaged. They just heat it up. I've ordered here over 5 times in hopes of them changing, but they are terrible. I had an issue with 2 of the 5 orders, including one time messing up an entire order. Instead of letting me keep the food, they demanded it back and found out later they just threw it away. Their poor attitude and lack of passion for their food will make me never come back here again."}
{"text":"Good value a large pizza that's actually large for 5.95 pick up.  I have tried a fee different pizza and would recommend the bacon pizza it goes well with their sweet Tomato sauce.  The pepperoni is also good and the wings are good and the price is right.  There is another older location off of grande ave hole in the wall but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, My second favorite pizza place and first favorite wing place. They have a much larger selection of Mexican food which is cool and different, but with already making great pizza who needs to try anything else?"}
{"text":"To much sugar in the sauce.very sweet,the dough is rubbery..they need to go to NYC and taste the real stuff."}
{"text":"I think this is the best pizza in Surprise.  Moving from CA finding good pizza, nearly impossible. Great pizza and wings and the prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch with with the family.  Pizza was good and my son's bacon cheeseburger was ok.  My hubby didn't like the wings too much but overall it's an ok spot to eat on a budget.  

My stars goes out to the customer service for Dine in.  They were all very nice and attentive.  I had no problem getting anything I asked for.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are amazing. We order from here at least 3 times a month. Always mushroom and sausage extra sauce and a pepperoni, bacon and jalape√±o extra sauce. With mild wings. Also their antipasto salad is amazing."}
{"text":"We're staying in Surprise for a few days and needed something different.  WE ordered a medium supreme pizza and an order of mild chicken wings.The chicken wings were PERFECT  and so was the pizza. We didnt feel overly stuffed after eating the thin crust supreme pizza. We will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome delivery service forget about all those other mom and pop shops like Ray and Lucky's this place does the best highly recommend this place its actual real pizza not know fake pizza from some bootleg New Yorkers"}
{"text":"Most. Amazing. Place. Ever. Seriously,  if you've never eaten here, your life is sad, and empty. My husband and I discovered this place by accident. The food is always delicious, and the employees are delightful."}
{"text":"I was walking through the parking lot one of their delivery drivers almost hit me with his blue pick up truck. As I ran to get out of the way he parked and didn't even bother to say I'm sorry. Mind u he seen me walking and just kept on going about his business"}
{"text":"If you're on a diet, this pizza is for you.  You will definitely be able to observe proper portion control with this pizza, as it is so disappointing that you will want to put it down.

The sauce tastes like Ragu, and half of the pizza is actually just crust.  Ordered a Large bacon pizza for delivery, price was comparable to other locations nearby.

Go down the road to Lucky's."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Family owned and operated. Try the wings.. With a hot works pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pickup, the staff did not give the correct food that was ordered. When I called back asking if they had the remainder of our order they said for us to drive all the way back to the store. They did NOT offer to deliver the food they had forgotten stating we had to come pick it up, stated stored credit would be offered. When asked about he store credit The \"manager\" on duty Adolfo said he would offer the credit of the food forgotten by his staff. When stated we had to travel all the way back to the store, Adolfo was rude and quick to state \"we couldn't have traveled that far\" and refused to give the credit. When the situation was stated he continued to refuse any kind of action to reimburse us for their mistake. Instead of exposing his situation he was rude and neglected to offer any kind of reimbursement. It's a shame to see a place of business lose customers due to a lack of management. The owner should look into better management of their place of ownership."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Amazing Mexican food and hot wings! We order from these guys a lot and never had a bad experience with them. Thanks US Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"El Mirage-Dysart and Grand location. At one time this was my favorite pizzeria. The wings were arguably the best in the valley. About a year ago I noticed the quality of the wings declined and they began messing up orders. I no longer do business with them due to an incident a few months ago. I ordered pizza for delivery with the expected time of 1 hour. After 1 1/2 hours I called and was informed the driver just left. 45 minutes later I called and they said the driver should be there any minute. After 30 minutes I called and canceled the order. I spoke to the manager who did try to make things right by offering the food for free-but after several hours I was just not interested. They should have called if there was an issue. Now they are probably too big to fail, but I'm certain my 50 dollar order and generous tips every other week will be missed."}
{"text":"Please read this review before ordering their pizza.

I ordered online eight days ago on the 10th of June. Right away I noticed that I was being charged twice. I noticed it was pending so I waited until it went through all the way. So I was charged twice: once for the 11th of June, and another for the 12th of June. I had my fiance call US Pizza, and they told her that we would need to bring in more information. So I stopped in after work, and the owner tells me that he would call the company that takes care of the online ordering later tonight. He tells me that it takes too long to call them, and he has things to do. I missed his call back later that night, and he leaves me a message saying that the company says they didn't charge me twice. So I go in on my day off to show him a print out of my checking account. We looked over it and he acknowledged that I was charged twice. He tells me that he will call me later because he is too busy, and calling the company takes too long. I tell him heck no, because I've come in twice and it's been eight days and I want to take care of it now. He continues to tell me that I will have to wait until tonight. So we argue for 30 minutes, and I tell him if he doesn't help me now that I will sue him in small claims court, and he will have to pay for the court fees, interest, and gas. He knew I was serious at that point, and finally began to slowly say he would call them now. I gave him an ultimatum that he had five minutes to call the company, or I'll see him in court. He began to tell me that I wasn't perfect, and that stuff like this happens. He also admitted that just a week prior a lady was double charged. He blamed it on her clicking the button twice, and said I probably did the same thing. Finally he gets on the phone, and it takes two minutes for him to get a hold of the company, and he gives me my 16 dollars. I will warn everyone not to do business with this company. He was laughing at me most of the time when I was talking to him, and laughed when I told him he'd be mad to if he got double charged, and nothing was done. He also told me that online reviews meen nothing because people lie. The problem is that I have a copy of me being double charged, and I'm not lying. Also previously when my fiance went to pick up our order the girl at the counter gave her a dirty look for not tipping. Why do we deserve a dirty look after we used our gas to come pick up our pizza?????"}
{"text":"I've had this Pizza twice now and have not been disappointed. I usually get thin crust Large 1 topping it's only 5.95. It's one of my favorite Pizza joints in Surprise and you can beat the quality, taste and price.. It's much better than the higher priced Pizza places in town.. and if you want NY Style just ask for thin crust & light on the cheese and it comes out just right, thin a little crispy, chewy and just right.  I usually order 2 large specials and it's a great deal for under 14 bucks!

BTW I tried a chicken taco from their Mexican food menu, and it was pretty good. I can't wait to try all the other items"}
{"text":"Been ordering from them for years. First off, no lie I really only use them as they are the only pizza delivery in my area. Heck, they don't even come up to my door but rather I have to meet them about 5 mins down on the main road. Yes, I live in BFE ( 163rd/Jomax) area where it is houses on acreage. But there are times when I don't wanna cook as well as drive 10 miles to pick up a pizza, so I call them. I appreciate that. 
     We are a family of 5, and I always order the monster pizza with 25 wings. This pizza is a freakin giant! I always add garlic in addition to my pepperoni, mushrooms, olives. I love that you can see the garlic, as well as taste it. I've never had an issue with the taste, always delicious. Never soggy or cold. The honey BBQ wings are my family's favorite as well as mine. Crispy, moist, drenched in sauce. As well as we always receive a few containers of the buttermilk dressing. 
     Yes, it always takes about an hour for delivery but that's normal as they are obviously busy/popular especially during prime time which I would say are the weekends as well as anytime during dinner hours (5-7). Knowing this, I order accordingly. The drivers have always been polite and courteous enough to give me a call as soon as they head down the main road so I have enough time to head out to meet them. 
     Albeit, over the last 5 years I've had maybe 2 minor issues that were cleared up quickly. One being double charged, the other having to wait over an hour and a half due to a mix up. They were quick to remedy both situations. Shit happens, they are human. Overall, a great place to order delicious food that delivers out here, and we will keep using them."}
{"text":"My family and I used to eat here (Bell/Reems) a lot, maybe once a month or so.  I liked the pizza and prices.  I think I liked the taste of the pizza a little more than my wife.  Our favorite order was pizza and wings.  My daughter and I loved the wings.  When we went in a few months ago, we were surprised to see the price increase on the hot wings...$12 for 12 wings.  Seriously?  A dollar per little wing?  That's too much.  I also wanted to comment on the price of their Mexican food....$7 for a bean and cheese burrito.  Who are they fooling?  That's absurd.  We walked in, saw the prices, then walked out.  Because of this change, US Pizza lost a good customer.  While the food tastes a little better than average, the pricing scheme is awful and appears to be not well thought-out.  Until they fix their pricing, we're not going back."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best wings around they are always nice and crispy and decent size and we also think the pizza is better than most. It's near our house so delivery service has been on time, and food has been hot."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price, just wish the breadsticks came out before the pizza, not 10 minutes after ."}
{"text":"Always consistent on quality. Great tasting. I have getting our pizza here for years. They are supposed to be opening a restaurant with a dining in option here in the next couple months."}
{"text":"Me being the clutz I am accidentally  dropped my super huge monster pizza as I was leaving....  I think everyone there and their grandma seen my sad and akward attempt to balance and save it. I mean this pizza was HUGE! My grace once again failed me big time and my two left feet kicked in.... I seriously think it was all in slow motion. Several staff members came outside to help me gather what was once a big beautiful pizza pie but now looked somewhat like a crumpled up wad of saucy, pepperoni, cheesey, mess... I was shocked I had destroyed it so badly but to my dismay they helped me gather the mess. Adolfo the owner (I thought he was a customer at 1st! )  offered me a new one for FREE!  They even replace the order of hot wings! 
 So on top of my embarrassing but awesome experience tonight I have to say that Adolfo and his crew take pride in what they do and they go above and beyond to take care of their customers. They really didn't have to do anything at all... it was all my fault! But they did and I thank them for doing so! Good job guys!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered the white pizza and it was really yummy.  Baked perfectly and seasoned well! We also tried the caramel and bavarian cream churro. The cream one was definitely better then the caramel.  The fried  zucchini and mushroom was good but way too greasy. Grease literally oozed out when we stuck a fork in them.  The wings were pretty greasy too. 5 stars on the pizza but 3 stars on the appetizers.  Oh, staff was really nice too :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Absolutely love the one topping large special.  Usually quick service and very consistent.  Wish they didn't charge for their water downed ranch though."}
{"text":"This used to be the family's 'guilty pleasure' location. We mostly pick-up or deliver our dinners.  The pizzas are great.  The appetizers are astounding. But the mex dinners rank them tops.  Don't get me wrong.  There are other fine mexican restaurants in the area. But, in a quick pinch and delivery... US Pizza stands out. Portions are big and guac is outta sight. However, one problem as of recent, The website no longer accepts credit cards.  So,my orders have been few and far between."}
{"text":"Well I just have to say that I will NEVER order pizza or wings from this place. My sister ordered 2 pizzas and 50 wings from this place and had it delivered. First it took over an hour to get there only to be given some wings that had already been eaten with the bones still in the box! When she called to talk to the manager their excuse was \"the cook was eating and we probably boxed and delivered his wings\". Excuse me but why in the heck is the cook eating where the food is being prepared!!! Serious sanitation violation."}
{"text":"The best place for pizza and wings in surprise! Very reasonable!! Give you a ton of ranch! Very clean and fast delivery!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place!  The pizza here is delicious.  There's nothing fancy about the pizza, it's just good.  I order the ham and pepperoni pizza along with 12 wings.  It's a special they have for I think 13.99.  The wings are just fine, but I'm not really that crazy about wings all together.   It takes about 45 minutes to be delivered.  The delivery boys are very polite.  I will continue to order from them for now on."}
{"text":"Trying out another pizza joint! Was my turn to cook, so I ordered Pizza. Wife wanted to try this place out. So I ordered an XL pepperoni pizza well done, then I noticed they also serve Mexican food? So I ordered three ground beef tacos, and a green chili burrito. The pizza is not that bad when hot, I enjoyed the cheese, pepperoni, and dough. The sauce can be better, it was more to the tomato sauce taste. I really enjoyed the green chili burrito, I made the mistake and asked for enchilada style. Should have just had plain. Wife did not like the taco's, I did not try them so I can not tell you why. Service was quick, and the food was hot. This is another place that has a delivery charge? I hate that, never been charged that in Cali, but since I moved here to AZ, seems like everyone has a delivery charge? Overall everything was good, have had better pizza, but I do like the variety of the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered an XL pizza. Delivery driver brought us a medium. Called the store and they argued that we were not given the wrong pizza and then hung up on my husband when he asked to speak with a manager. My husband called again, and asked to speak with a manager and they told us that the manager was out of town. Then, the employee who answered (claiming to be the managers brother) told my husband that he can \"come down to the store to talk about it\"... in a suggestive tone. They exchanged words, and again hung up on. Will not ever be doing business with this company again. I wish I could leave 0 stars. Garbage."}
{"text":"We love US pizza. The price is great and pizza is amazing. Mexican food is also really really good. When we can't decide on what to get we can go here and get pizza Mexican or burgers and everyone get be happy"}
{"text":"I love this place! Compares to Barros but better and cheaper! Me, my hubby, and our kids all love the pizza and wings here. The wings are meaty and definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings. To feed a family of 4 when 3 out of 4 are men/ boys you can't beat it! Screw the pizza huts and papa johns chain pizza joints and check this place out. Delivery is fast and they are always nice. Our delivery place since we first tried it and from now on."}
{"text":"Just tried their pizza, and it was amazing. Prices are awesome, Pizza was fantastic and the people are so friendly. This is a local business, which I love to support. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food usually takes about an hour to receive the food only complaint is the delivery times sometimes extend to hour and a half sometimes receiving cold. I have recommended there food to many people and wish both locations would serve the Mexican food too. Prices are good as well if you prefer al a cart or bundle deals current fave is the pizza and wings combos."}
{"text":"I've always loved the food but now they have football and beer. We need to support local businesses."}
{"text":"I ordered online, when I went inside to pick up my pizza the gal at the desk seemed like she hated her life and made me feel as if I was inconveniencing her.  
Upon biting into my pizza, I was immediately sent back in time to the days of school cafeteria pizza.  My husband agreed.  It was not good to say the least.  
I would say little caesars over these guys any day for a cheap pizza."}
{"text":"This may be out new pizza delivery go to.  I ordered for the first time the other day and I was impressed at how fast the food came, the pizza and wings were pretty good.  The girl on the phone who took my order was cold, but not rude.  I was impressed with the prices and specials."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've received in a while. Insanely late delivery, cold and soggy food, rude employees. Overall terrible experience."}
{"text":"Looking for a place that deliver close by didn't have a car at the time and I found this place quick delivery and I must say the wings are the bomb pizza was great but i kept coming back for the wings . the wings were bomb well worth it at $17.99  had leftovers for the next day. Well worth it for a single person."}
{"text":"I have always ordered from here and do not get me wrong the food is good for the price they charge. I have always been disappointed by the customer service but wow hands down this time has to be the worst at 10/5/2016 at 440pm i ordered a delivery from a lady name Maria she was sooo rude. Did not even say thank you for calling. I was going to place my order online but decided to call. The online order was less by two dollars. I asked why. She ignored my question and said do you want it or not. WOW I was shocked. I asked for a manger and said that no one was there. after the order was place did not say thank you. The only thing I got was, YOUR ORDER WILL BE READY IN 5min to a HOUR are you kidding me. Its sooo sad that someone that has work so hard to build a brand has a worker that destroys it."}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian, the pizza was spot on. First pizza place we can say that. 5+ star rating. The sampler (onion rings, mushroom, etc) was ok. Needs seasoning big time. That needs to be changed. Staff was friendly, we'd come back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, felt rushed off the phone when ordering. Was told it's a $1 extra for each topping when I got the total it didn't add up I walked her through the prices and her response \" oh toppings must be $1.50 and the rest should be delivery charge ya that sounds about right?\" Okay I'm hungry it adds up with the newly changed pricing whatever. I was told 40 to 55 min at 6:48 pm come 8:02 still no pizza. I call she says they are min away call back in 5 to 8 min. If they don't make it well its now 8:14 pm and I'm writing this review. Won't order again.  Just got my pizza now 8:24 pm and to be honest it is warm but the white pizza is far from it for $3 more I could of got a oh so yummy white pizza and wings from Barros."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint in Surprise. We have been ordering from here for years and are just so impressed with the quality of the pizza & wings. Haven't had any issues with customer service or our orders. My mother who lives in North Phoenix has me order it every time she comes out because she thinks it's amazing as well. Wings are on the spicy side as a heads up!"}
{"text":"I like to think Im a forgiving person when it comes to various mistakes and with U.S. Pizza things have happened that I have forgiven them for. They forgot to put my order in so I wait 2 hours to get food. I get the wrong food when it finally comes to my house after the 1+ hour for delivery. They dont bring my whole order so now some people have food and some people dont and we have to wait longer for them to bring it. It was this last time though that really just told me to never order or go into this place ever again. I want 2 meatball subs, but my wife doesnt eat bread so I tell the cashier that I dont want the bread in one container and could you throw some extra meatballs in there for me? \"No problem\" she says with a smile. Im thinking this transaction is going very well right now and so I pay, sign the receipt and wait for my food. Maybe 2 or 3 minutes later the cashier tells me they have to charge me 1.68 for the 3 extra meat balls that I wanted. Now in my head Im thinking \"Didnt I discuss the meatball issue with the cashier already and didnt I pay already AND didnt they accept my payment knowing I wanted extra meat balls?\" Interesting. I dont feel like making a scene so I just go up and pay my 1.68 got my subs and walked out. Its just one of those things that get to you more than anything I suppose. I was a very good customer that did order alot from there and a great tipper to the delivery people, but now because they just HAD to have their 1.68 I will never be ordering food from there again just out of pure principle."}
{"text":"Just called to place an order.  Was told on the phone \"I don't know what you're looking at but it's not our ad\" when I tried to order the 2XL special.  I asked her are you at 15459 W. Bell b/c it's your ad.  She said it must be the other location.  I asked her what the price was for that special and she raised the price $5.  She definitely didn't care about the ad or her customers so I spent my $50 order at Barros, plus $10 tip for the driver!   No second chances from me. .."}
{"text":"Food is good and I dont mine waiting awhile for delivery. But we got the wrong pizza (which it happens) I called and they said the would switch the pizzas out. So delivery man came back and we swaped pizzas. I was reassured that mine was in the delivery car the whole time. I know they gave the pizza I had in my house that I opened to someone else. I lost my trust in them. I know I am a clean person and did not touch the pizza it self. But what if I did something to it? You dont know now days.  Should be once out of the sight of the driver you cant give it to anyone else. Then I cant get their contact page to work on the web sight. Will give them a call tomorrow."}
{"text":"Super delicious pizza and wings! Had the monster pizza for 4 adults and 4 kids and had plenty left over. Probably the best tasting pizza crust we have had. Highly suggest this place.  Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"We used to eat here 1-2x per week. But their pizza started to taste differently about a year ago and we haven't been back much since."}
{"text":"We wanted pizza and not delivered. ...finding a sit down place seems to be difficult.  My husband's coworker said we should try US PIZZA. ....We found one not far from our house at Bell and Reems. The sitting area is a little plain not what I would call cozy (low lighting etc). But, it is clean, they have several TV's the menu even has Mexican food on it now. The employees were all very friendly. We ordered our pizza (meat deluxe), my hubby got an antipasto salad and I ordered one taco to see how they were. When the food came we couldn't believe how big the salad was and the pizza. The taco was good and fresh...we took food home. It was very very good and fresh. The pizza dough took me back to the real dough I remember as a kid. Yummy we will return. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"This one of our top favorite Pizza joints!! Always tasty and fresh!! We love their wings!! Always crunchy and delicious!! Never a disappointment!! Tried their cheesecake and it was good as well!! Thank you for your consistency in flavor!!"}
{"text":"Other pizza places will not deliver to us. One day we say a US Pizza guy in our neighborhood and called up. Pizza was good, I loved the hot wings. The wings are very traditional classic taste, hot enough, but not too hot. I look forward to trying the Mexican food. Do not be afraid to try this place out, it won't knock your socks off but you will get some good food."}
{"text":"Great service! 

Love the pizza!  Very reasonable Prices!

And they don't even charge you for Ranch dressing! LOL

Mexican food looked good also, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"First of all its amazing that this establishment will drive so far to a neighborhood that is non existent. They were polite when the delivered and quiet. BUT the food was cold and my friend mushrooms were soggy. I don't want to complain because I don't live this far. I guess I am complaining. Please try harder."}
{"text":"I ordered Mexican food for delivery... delivery was fast but the fried burrito, did I say fried???,,, yep, was fried but soft and gross.  The  nachos supreme  was cold and tortilla chips were soggy.
Just a big cold glob .. and  couldn't eat it.
No more mexican food delivery for me."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and the price is right but their pizza is a floppy mess. Of you like greasy pizza that doesnt stand up on its own, even if you hold it taco style, this place is for you. Maybe next time I'll order the pizza crispy. The wings however are excellent and crispy!"}
{"text":"Although I usually go to the El Mirage location I have been here twice leaving the gym. They are exactly the same pizza is mediocre, nothing special, wings (suicide and hot) are absolutely amazing chicken is cooked properly wings are crispy and sauce is tasty. What more can you ask for. They only give packets of blue cheese ( and charge 50 cents) which I hate but the wings are the best I have had and they pay attention to your order (most of the time) and get it correct. I have eaten wings all over the valley but somehow I always end up back at US Pizza."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I already reviews this place, it might have been the us pizza on grand. I'm not a big fan o the pizza here. For good quick pizza go to SAMs club or Peter piper pizza. For quality pizza go to New York. If you are like me and settle for whatever's relatively cheap and quick come here. Wish I could say something better since I'm the Duke of this place but \"eh\", I shrug off my responsibilities on this one."}
{"text":"Delivery is king, price is right, and pizza and wings are good.

I enjoyed a pepperoni and bacon pizza with the sweet barbecue wings for $17.99 plus delivery.  

I also had a pepperoni and ham pizza with the sweet barbecue wings.

Both times the pizza and wings disappeared within an hour at my home.  Must be good pizza and the price is less than other providers in the area.  
Try them out :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, excellent prices and friendly service. Mexican food and wings should be skipped if you're looking for good food. Just stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"Food is good but very poor customer service. My
20 minute wait was an hour. Other upset customers too"}
{"text":"We are a large family and so when we order pizza it $50 or more easy. We order 2-4 times a month. I am sad to say that our family will no longer order pizza from US pizza after being instructed to order from Papa John's pizza by the order taker at US pizza told us that after I called to complaint about an order that I called in 2 hours before I needed because it was important for it to arrive at a certain time. The time came and went. We waited another 15 minutes before I called inquiring why the order was so late and I was told that they only have 3 delivery drivers maybe I should order from Papa John's because they have like 15 drivers. Well we took her advice and switched to a new pizza delivery."}
{"text":"I've worked at virtually every pizza place nearby (not US PIZZA) and for years this has been my family's go-to for good pizza and WINGGGSSSS.

Also one of the places you can get Disneyland-Quality CHURROS nearby. 

Tip: 
-Get the wings DOUBLE COOKED, trust me you'll never order regular wings again!!
-Extra sauce on the pizzas are also a very TASTY addition

Thanks US, You guys have never screwed up my orders and the food is always hot and DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit family in Surprise we eat here..., there is something for everyone. The pizza, wings and Mexican food is fresh. The food has a great unique flavor, doesn't taste like change restaurant food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and pizza was awesome and wings were fresh with a great zing to them. Staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely coming back with my family for a nice din din.  I wish they had one in laveen."}
