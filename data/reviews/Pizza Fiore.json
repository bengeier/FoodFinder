{"text":"Le vrai four à bois à l'entrée était prometteur. Malheureusement, avoir un beau four ne suffit pas. Les pizzas sont dégoûtantes. Passez votre chemin."}
{"text":"Pizzeria a l'ancienne comme indiqué, ils disposent d'un vrai bon gros four! Et les pizzas a la sortie sont super réussis! Miam! Je m'y suis régalée avec les camarades de la promo!


 Ambiance très a l'ancienne! Bcp de places pr accueillir les clients, a l'interieur comme en terrasse pr profiter du soleil ;)


 Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service correct. La salade repas est bonne, mais très peu de légumes en accompagnent. Bref, une chance que le pain est à volonté! Si vous avez vraiment faim, je vous suggère de plutôt opter pour les pâtes ou la pizza."}
{"text":"Took 14 customers out here the otehr night.  All of our food came out at the same time.  Fries and break to begin with are awesome.  The pizza and calzones were also great wih no complaints (for Montreal pizza).  The waitress was ver attentive and we had glasses of water and beer filled every time someone was empty."}
{"text":"Not bad. Service is good and the pizza is also pretty good. The food overall isn't bad. This place isn't bad overall so check it out if you want pizza and you're near by."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for some good pizza, and personally I was sadly disappointed. I'be spent the last month in Europe, where I was fortunate to have some very good pizza in Spain, and I was looking forward to compare it to that of my beloved Montreal.

My mother works close Pozzafiore and she told me that's where she goes to get we pizza fix. The menu had a lot of great choices ranging, 33 (I think) actually. Today I had the Fornorina (pizza with olive oil, rosemary, parsley, cheese and fresh tomatoes. Well I have to say it did not make it into my top 10 pizzas. The dough and pizza crust was below my standards, it was some and bread-like. The cheese was the normal grated mozzarella, not a huge fan after having good quality buffalo di mozzarella in Spain. The thing that was actually unforgivable was the lack of fresh tomatoes on the pizza. I counted 6 small half or quarter slices of a normal tomato. This was not at all what I was expecting, and definitely forced me to write this review.

On a more pleasant note, my mother had La Chèvre pizza and I felt it was more satisfying than mine, mainly because it had more and different ingredients. It had tomato sauce, goat cheese, onions, Kalamata olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. It was actually not bad, and would have been better with different pizza dough in my opinion.

Well the one reason I have to go back to this pizzeria is not for the pizza but for the fries. Apparently they are seasoned extremely well and are hand-cut. Well that something that does sound good to me. Look for a review in the future when I DO try them. In the meantime anyone who goes here and tries the fries, let me know how they are."}
{"text":"Nice little place in Cote des Neiges, servive is good. Pizza are good. As for the pasta, I tried a few different sauce and wasn't impressed by any of them. The fries are REALLY good, fresh and well seasoned."}
