{"text":"This has to be the greatest chicken poutine in town if not the province. The chicken is incredibly tender and offers a blast of chicken flavour in every bite, augmented by chorizo chips, which has to be one the greatest things ever!  If you're looking for a good chicken poutine, look no further! The best one is at Campo!"}
{"text":"Chicken was rubbery, not tasty at all and overpriced compared to other Portuguese places (like Romados). I left half the meal."}
{"text":"A delicious little Italian restaurant, with some very tasty gnocchi and wine. We started with a meat board and toast, and both were lovely as well. Service was wonderful.  Just a short walk from Jane Subway Station. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On a whim I invited a friend out for dinner and we decided to try Campo. Best decision...the food was excellent...Delish meatballs with polenta and the pasta with the 2 day simmering sauce...Yum. The service was fun and efficient. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have no negative things to say for Campo!! Easily my new favourite spot. From the minute we walked in, the ambiance and service was great, the food was UNREAL. The combination of flavours were so well-thought out, they created some of the best dishes I've had. We got the toast and cauliflower salad to start- incredible, followed by the seafood and chorizo pasta and one of the specials, a beef cheek spaghetti-- absolutely delicious. For dessert, the budino (I hope that's how you spell it) was perfection.  These guys know what they're doing and they do it impeccably. The service was awesome too! Most definitely will return."}
{"text":"Not even remotely close to the best Portuguese chicken in Montreal. I had the chicken sandwich and the sauce was very sour, which made it taste like lemon chicken. The chicken wings that I had were probably as bad as the ones you can buy at the supermarket. Very disappointing experience. Prices are high as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic friendly restaurant in Baby Point. The cocktails are delicious, the wine delicious, oh! And they serve delicious food too.   The toast was amazing and highly recommended. Go before it becomes too trendy and you can't get a table!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here two times before and was slightly disappointed, but was convinced by my Mom to come again a they had gotten better since the last time I'd been. And they sure did! Portion sizes are larger so you're not leaving still hungry, food was absolutely divine I had the gnocchi that I scarfed down, my parent's had the meatballs that I helped finish, they had the Arugala salad that is very generous in size and we finished it off with coffee and their AMAZING sea salted caramel pudding dessert. Go there. Go there now and be blown away."}
{"text":"A quick update to say that we have returned numerous times and have not only never been disappointed but truly enjoyed our meal every time.  Tonight was no exception, we had the specials, the burrata and the garganelli with an excellent bottle of table wine.  All were truly perfectly made and delicious.  The chef has an excellent command of his kitchen, he is so consistent and clear in his cooking,  and the staff are excellent overall.  We are so pleased to have this restaurant in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Had baked eggs in tomato sauce... it was good (i'd give it a 3/5). Bumped up an extra star because I do look forward to coming back and giving their dinner menu a chance. Service was good, as the iced espresso."}
{"text":"Went for dinner recently and have to say the food was great, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was terrific. But what's the deal with all the cauliflower? It is the fruit of the devil :)"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner at Campo.  We had a great dinner with great service.  The gnocchi was fantastic.  We live in the neighborhood and will be making this one of our new go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Très bon service, très bien situé et du bon poulet. C'est pas le meilleur que j'ai mangé mais il est quand même très bon. J'ai pris le chorizo grillé, le poulet,les frites et la salade en combo.   L'endroit est sympathique et bien aménagé et il y a une petite terrasse à l'extérieur. Si vous voulez manger du poulet portugais Et que vous êtes dans le coin, vous ne serez pas déçus. C'est pas le meilleur des meilleurs mais la nourriture est de très bonne qualité."}
{"text":"Small, intimate venue with great food. Be prepared - they only accept cash/debit!"}
{"text":"A warm, cozy resto full of charm. A stones throw from Jane subway station, this place is great for a date night.  Service is always friendly and I've eaten almost everything on the menu.  Save room for dessert they turn a regular pudding into heavenly goodness.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Carefully thought out menus, perfectly balanced dishes and a wonderful staff make this a true gem in Bloor West. The restaurant is quaint and tastefully decorated, feeling more like a European find than a west Toronto eatery The Italian and Spanish style dishes are paired with a fantastic selection of reds, whites, unique beers and beautifully crafted cocktails. The dishes are well portioned and thoughtfully plated. We decided to go outside of our box and order the toasted country bread: Sobrasada, manchego cheese and topped with a white anchovy. The saltiness of the anchovy worked perfectly with the Sobrasada, definitely worth the try!  Do not dare to skip the dessert. The salted caramel pudding was unreal, and the tiramisu was a great way to top off a wonderful night out!"}
{"text":"Good looking counter restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Expect to wait for your food as they seem to fry the fries as needed which is great, and longer for your grilled chicken; though I would not recommend as it is quite dry and needs plenty of Tabasco sauce or Ketchup. The meat was better on chicken roll but then it was drenched in sauce; the bread would have been better if lightly grilled. Personally I found their portion size sufficient for the price, problem is taste and flavor; and an excuse to eat Nata."}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant close to Jane and Bloor. My wife and I randomly ran into this Italian-Spanish place for dinner and we didn't regret our choice. Delicious soup and gnocci. The owner and chef was very friendly and helpful. Meal size is not too big and not too small, but the taste is really good. Next time we would like to try their desserts and coffee as well. So far we can highly recommend this relatively new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Honolulu with my co-worker from Los Angeles. We stumbled upon this gem on Yelp. I generally only use Yelp for searching, not for leaving reviews, however I just had to let everyone know how amazing this place was. Service was on point from the moment we walked in without a reservation (which is a big deal since they have such a small capacity).  We had the Burrata, Chef's Special and the meatballs over polenta, and we barely spoke to each other until everything was gone. My co-worker likes me more now because of my on point dinner selection haha! Love this place, wish I could bring t back to Hawaii with me!"}
{"text":"2nd time eating here and love the food, the vibe and the people.  Food is flavourful, service excellent and space is cozy and intimate.  Great neighbourhood restaurant that will be on regular rotation for dinner"}
{"text":"I am a local in the 'hood and go to Campo at least 4x per month. I love everything about the place: Joe and Carlos, the owners, have a wonderful laid-back vibe, even as they clearly take food quality and freshness very seriously. And the staff (Blair, Craig, Sean, and the new girl whose name escapes me) are superb: smart, amiable, and always on the ball. I am so glad to have this 'well lighted place' (to use Hemingway's term) right around the corner, with such dependable food and good cheer. Much appreciate you guys!  [BTW, the 1-star review by Mary Lou M deserves a response. I was sitting right in front of her when she tore a strip off the maitre d' because of an honest scheduling mistake. Campo's oversight hardly warranted her shouting at the patrons, slamming the door, and penning a vindictive review. You can basically ignore what she says and pray, pray, pray she meant it when she vowed never to return.]"}
{"text":"Finger licking good, with one minor imperfection. Overall I have enjoyed Campo each and every time I stop by for lunch or take-out. The place is lively with a great taste in decorations and music. Service is excellent! Always kind, polite, and most of all speedy during their lunch rush.   As for the food. Chicken is tender and perfectly cooked. Delicious seasoning however, it'squite  salty! Their fries are very good, again.. very salty! I would serve them on the side and not on the bottom of the chicken. Fries do become a bit soggy if you do not eat them fast enough. I'd make them a touch more crispy please! Just a touch!   Now I know that salt tolerance depends from one person to another. What might be salty to me is not salty to you. Which is understandable. I did find myself drinking quite a few glasses of water after our meal.  Their green salad is crispy, fresh with a delicious dressing! It is missing some colour. I wish they would add another veggie or two aside from just romaine lettuce.  Let me brag about their amazing Natas and chocolate mousse. Do make sure to leave some space in your tummy for their oh so rich, sense, silky chocolate mouse. Or their crumbly, buttery, delicious Natas.  All this being said.. My only negative criticism again is that their food is quite salty. Which is something easy to change. With all this being said. I will be returning to Campo again, and again."}
{"text":"These guys do it well. Really tasty food, great atmosphere, phenomenal staff and everything tastes like it's made with love. They take their food seriously and I take their food seriously, so you should take their food. Seriously. You should."}
{"text":"Très bon poulet tendre et juteux pour le quartier. Le petit restaurant est très beau et charmant.   Je suis allé un samedi après-midi, alors il n'y avait pas de file d'attente. Le service était sympathique.   Ce que j'aime beaucoup des rôtisseries portugaises en ville, c'est leur sauce piquante. Ici, il n'y avait pas une sauce à côté qui accompagne le poulet, mais le poulet est bien assaisonnée. La proportion poulet/sandwich était bonne. Le sandwich seul m'a coûté environ 10$ avec taxes et pourboire.   Je reviendrai en soirée essayer leurs ailes de poulet et côtes levées, ainsi que le poulet entier. Merci pour ce petit charme au centre ville.   Essayé le 24 sept. 2016."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We had almost everything on the menu. Our server Stephanie was great! The gnocchi and roasted cauliflower salad are out of this world."}
{"text":"We had the chicken, the choriço and some vinho verde. Everything was excellent! I also liked the ambiance and service was very good. Being Brazilian, I still find it weird to see that in Montreal Portuguese food means \"chicken\". In Brazil, we associate 'comida portuguesa' with seafood, mostly cod. So I'm not an expert in \"Portuguese chicken\", but this one was juicy and full of flavour!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night and it was just fabulous. I called ahead of time to find out if there were vegetarian options, which there were and then managed to get a reservation for 8.30 (definitely need reservations as it is a small place). We had the roasted cauliflower salad as so many reviews said it was great, and it was amazing. I don't even like cauliflower, it was really just that good. We also had the country toasts, spaghetti bolognese and gnocchi (made veggie). The wine was great as well, and we had some sort of caramel sea salt pudding thing. Everything was excellent, and as we live close by I'm sure we'll be back again! Only thing I'd wish I'd known was that it's cash or debit only."}
{"text":"If you want good Portuguese chicken and fast service this is the place to go! Very good food and very nice staff, one of my favourite places to get Portuguese chicken. Make sure to grab a Super bock beer with your meal."}
{"text":"Bad value for the money. I got a half-chicken, no sides, it was $11.50 after tax so right off the bat something was wrong with the value proposition. The half-chicken was tiny, extremely dry and tough with little to no char flavour. This is quite possibly the worst Portuguese chicken I've had in Montreal.  There is beer and wine on tap, and even pricier wine bottles, a décor that's just too neat to be authentic, all that to reinforce what you're getting. Look, I get it that it's a work-friendly downtown take-out counter but I would rather get St-Hubert if I were in a hurry or go to a real Portuguese chicken restaurant which there are many in this city."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have only had brunch here but we have made ourselves regulars because we have always left there so happy. Service is always amazing and food is 10/10. A great gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Interesting place on the west end. Came here for dinner and we ordered a the Arugula Salad and a Seafood Pasta. I believe they change their menu often because I don't see some of the dish in review pictures.   Arugula Salad is soooo good. Definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. However, the pasta was under cooked and was quite hard. I had to ask the chef to take it back and cook a bit more. Overall I think for the price I was paying, I might not go back."}
{"text":"If I could give and extra half star I would but overall, campo is very basic especially for the price you are paying. It is just 'ok' Portuguese chicken and ribs and considering all the amazing options in Montreal, I don't think it's worth the time and money. I've been twice (to give it a second chance) and was disappoint both times. The coleslaw was tasteless and I find myself constantly putting piri piri on the meat to give it flavour."}
{"text":"Terrible vibe  they say they don't take reservation for bar seats but when we arrived we were told bar seats were reserved. Liars"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. Nice trendy decor. The chicken poutine with additional Portuguese sauce which was really tasty. The price is on par with Downtown standards. It could get very loud in the space, and long line up too, so arrive early."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was blown away by how good it was. I had the Revueltos and my girlfriend had the Purgatorio Baked Eggs. The Revueltos was very good but the Purgatorio was absolutely fantastic. Even more impressive was how fast the food came out. I'm secretly hoping that it won't get too popular because I don't want to stand in line on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars leaning towards 4. I love the concept of this place. A clean and modern place for lunch that serves delicious chicken and alcoholic beverages at a competitive price. Adam works in an office and he said it's the perfect place for a low-key business meeting.    Portions are ok but some meals are pricier than others. For example, the chicken poutine is around 17$ with tax and it's not bigger than a combo meal thigh.   The chicken is savoury and well seasoned. The fries are just ok but I like that they place the chicken on top of them so they get a bit of flavour.   Overall, not a bad Portuguese chicken place. Worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I would include it in the lunch fast food or quick dinner category so it that sense it's a really amazing option and blows out of the water almost any food court restaurant! I've tried both the chicken and chicken sandwich options which we're pretty good but personally preferred the sandwich maybe because it is a fresh take on Portuguese chicken and their homemade bread was pretty crispy and delicious ! The fries were great, made with fresh cut potatoes and cooked the crispy perfection some reviews pointed out fries were not cooked well but that wasn't my experience. H Anyways I highly recommend for a delicious quick lunch option :-)"}
{"text":"The good: the location and the look and feel of the restaurant. Clean and very modern. The chicken is average, loved the fries, pork sandwich was probably the best item there. Staff very polite   The bad: pretty expensive for what you get. Portions are small-average   Not much ugly. Average place but worth the visit atleast once."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  They had our electronic  reservation and said oh but we missed in our manual book so sorry. Empty tables available and they turned us away in the rain.  Will never ever ever go back.  We went there for all of our occasions but never again."}
{"text":"What a gem! I never have high hopes for food offerings on Jane Street. Campo was a real surprise. The feel inside is warm and cosy. The staff were professional and friendly and we were seated at the bar (our preference!) and got to watch the team at work. The menu is a mix of my favourites, all prepared with care. The meatballs on polenta were very satisfying. The wine selection was above average. The Tiramisu made me want to cry. In the good way. On the whole an excellent addition to the neighbourhood.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"No frills Portuguese chicken joint with a low key vibe but so delicious.   Ordered the chicken sandwich that came with fries and a salad, and ate it on their small patio outside. Great spot!"}
{"text":"So many great Portuguese chicken places in this city. This is unfortunately not one of them. Being a semi-regular customer at Romados and Poule Mouillée, I am accustomed to good portuguese chicken.  I decided to give this place a try after a friend recommended me. First thing I noticed while entering the restaurant was the high prices (eg. 11$ for a chicken thigh combo). Being already inside, I ordered the thigh combo, which comes with a small salad and some fries.   The chicken itself was pretty bland and the portion was fairly small. Definitely not was I was expecting for that price. A good part is the decor looks very nice and it has a small terrasse. Other than that, I could not really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Please, make your self a favour and  go to Campo, delicious food, great wines and not even talk about desserts !! Adrian is such an amazing and lovely host, she will make your visit the best !! Thank you so much !!"}
{"text":"Dont live in the area but walk by Campo (Camp) occasionally and been curious to try it out. Decided to try it last night.  The booking experience over the phone with Kevin was excellent. Helpful and accommodating. I arrived with 2 friends. Table for 3 in the back corner. Great.  However the noise level was appalling.  My throat notices the difference this morning because we had to shout to hear each other.  So much for cute and cozy. Although the décor is trendy.  In fairness there was one group of particularly loud men at our next table and they were the main source of noise. They could have been celebrating a recent business venture and were  jolly and loud and enjoying themselves.  Surprising they should choose Campo for such an event. A larger venue would have been more appropriate and they could have blended into a Bay Street crowd.   In fact had they not left we would not have stayed for dessert. It was not a good experience.  Not sure how Campo can control that but it was disruptive.  But even when they left and things quietened down it was not as cute and cozy as we expected. All sound and conversation carries. Couldn't they look into so kind of sound proofing.   I wouldn't recommend Campo for a cozy and chatty dinner with friends. We were deceived by appearance and reviews and unlikely to go there again.  Unfortunately the overall experience will not be remembered by the good food and service. Yes. Food and service good."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't been to Campo before, given I live just few minutes away. Yesterday I convinced the S.O to ditch brunch plans and try this with me.  We ordered a full chicken, it was just alright but I have to say- not worth the price. Paying $19 for just the chicken and no sides was a bit too much.   PLUS: It is lively, the vibes are good and conveniently located (opposite the metro, bixi stand close by). Chicken is tender (slightly too oily for my liking)  MINUS: It lacked the usual char flavour, portions were small and I wasn't too impressed by the service. It isn't good to serve water in glasses that are as small as shot glasses or bring out one tissue when asked.   Can we also agree, putting salad alongside the desserts are a bad idea? Some of us are quick to give into temptation. We don't need those kind of challenges on a daily basis.   I wouldn't recommend this place as it is not worth the price and this isn't good Portuguese chicken."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and can't wait to go back!! The Spanish Italian fusion is so interesting and innovative.  Its a breath of fresh air to the rest of the standard cuisine in the city."}
{"text":"Campo is that great local spot that has managed (for good or bad) to fly under the radar. The reason for this is likely due to its obscure location between Bloor and Annette Streets on Jane.  If you have never been here, you should. Main entrees are priced in the 19-29$ range; appetizers are in the 8-15$ range.  The menu is small. It features a couple of very delicious salads, a chicken-liver spread that is very good, and basically a chicken dish, lamb gnocchi, strip loin, and a fish dish. My table enjoyed the strip loin and the gnocchi. They were superb.  The restaurant is small, so reservations are probably needed on weekends. They do have bar and table seating with a couple of draught beers and an ample wine selection.  The only real miss here is the service. It is basically good, though somewhat frantic. While this can be overlooked, they miss opportunities to do things like offer to take your coat, offer fresh pepper or Parmesan at your table, automatically bring bread/water, or introduce you to the chef/owner in hopes of building a \"we'll be back regularly\" kind of clientele. They are small enough to make everyone feel like a very special guest, yet come up just a bit short in this regard."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  Go to La Poule Mouillée for much better value and tastier chicken.  Chicken was small and the only flavour I got from it was overwhelmingly salty. Spices were just not there.  Service was good, but the food was just lacking. I would not return."}
{"text":"Best Ribs in town!! Hot in the restaurant or even 2 days later as a cold take out lunch they are delicious! I want more!!"}
{"text":"We had a perfect night at Campo.  It is a small restaurant and we showed up without reservations on a Saturday night.  While they were happy to try and squeeze us in and seat us a table, we were having so much fun at the bar we decided to have dinner there. The food was delicious, Lobster Salad to start, sea bass and carbonara for mains.  Also, one of the best Manhattans I've had in awhile.  Oh, and the sea salt caramel desert is absolutely ridiculous!! Comfortable atmosphere, small but inviting menu, delicious food and friendly, unpretentious staff.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"On a Friday night, I stumble upon this restaurant in downtown. When I went in, I asked the server for advices on what to eat. He recommends me the chicken thigh for a juicier taste. My meal comes with a chicken thigh, fries and salads. The drink, you order separately from the combo.   When I took a bite of the chicken, I was humbly surprise that it tastes very good. Usually, I only like BBQ chicken, this one satisfy my cravings.   Overall, I give this place a 4 out 5. I took a star out because they don't have ribs for my bf on that night. I am joking! I think this place is good but it needs some improvement on their menu choices."}
{"text":"Excellent vibes, friendly service and innovative European fusion dishes. Campo feels like a mix between a French family kitchen and a top-notch New York bistro."}
{"text":"Good Portuguese chicken. I recently went there, it was maybe my fifth time and ordered the regular, half a chicken with salad. I noticed that their chicken became tastier and more juicy. Good if you want to eat quickly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and the food is consistently fresh and tasty and the service is very down to earth and knowledgeable. The ambiance is very trendy, and the plates are very unique. I would like to buy the plates actually, they are that pretty. We had many dishes, such as delicious salads, the gnocchi, and the sea salt budino. I highly recommend this restaurant and make reservations as it gets very busy. Please note that they only accept cash or debit. Would be a nice improvement to take credit cards as well."}
{"text":"Compttoir portugais rapide. On m'avait dit que la poutine était extraordinaire. Je l'ai trouvée bonne mais sans plus. La sauce est très salée, ce qui plaît beaucoup en général.  Le poulet est très bon.  À essayer si vous avez envie d'un repas rapide et \"efficace\".  Jolie déco."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, this place is what it is. It was freezing today in Montreal so I wanted something close to my hotel and discovered Campo. I got half a chicken which is what you see in the picture. It was salty and greasy as other yelpers have shared. It wasn't a Total let down for a chicken spot."}
{"text":"We visited Campo for dinner on a weeknight. The restaurant is a small space that seems it will work really well as a high-quality local restaurant. Ambiance is casual but the food is first class all the way.   The burrata appetizer was super fresh and yummy, served with roasted butternut squash and garlic toasts. I also had the radicchio salad which was generously portioned and perfectly dressed. The beef was a perfect medium rare and so tender it did not require a steak knife, and the rainbow trout and cauliflower dish was also totally amazing and well balanced. We even sampled the dessert menu and I would recommend either the pudding or the olive oil cake! Although the menu is small you can tell that a lot of care and perfection goes into each plate, so you can't really go wrong.   While we didn't get a chance to see a busy weekend dinner service, the service we received there was attentive and wonderful. I think the *only* \"complaint\" I have (very very minor because the food was so incredibly awesome) was that there was a bright florescent light in the kitchen that shone out into the dining room quite brightly--they might want to shade the dining room a bit better at night to create a cozier atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good local place - service was friendly, but professional and both bar and food were excellent.   Had the charcuterie plate - very nice selection and bread was well portioned and hearty enough to stand up to it. Chilled fresh pea soup was perfectly smooth - salad was a bit oversized, but good.  Gnocchi were as good as other reviews promised in a light slightly spicy sauce - meatballs on a bed of polenta was the standout though.   Tiramisu was meh - not quite soaked enough and not quite sweet enough. Salted caramel budino more than made up for it though - and the espresso was just right.  Definitely worth a visit in Bloor West - nice to see this area continue to develop in its own right. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Huge hype about this place in the neighbourhood, and it always looks full at dinner. I will caveat the following with the fact that I was there for lunch.   We were in lying one of two tables seated and it was still impressively slow service. The little annoying things like bringing a dessert menu but never coming back to actually ask for our order from it. Coming to fill water glasses and only filling one person's.   The food seemed pretty overpriced for what it was. The salad was great, but my gnocchi was half decent, and half really undercooked and basically dough. A nice fresh tomato sauce, but again, pretty pricey for what it is.   I may give it a go for dinner, but it was definitely a disappointing and expensive lunch attempt."}
{"text":"OK, what a cute place in the center of the city. For lunch I'm sure it is a good option, but why 3 stars you ask? Well the food and atmosphere is good, but in a town with some outstanding Portuguese chicken it wouldn't be right to give any more stars. The taste, price and quantity are by far better at the Montreal Portuguese best, Romados, Ma poule mouillé and even Piri Piri. Weak on quantity and price and often for me that doesn't matter as much but with the flavor and freshness not even close to the others we will have to settle for a 3 star. Don't get me wrong, this is a good option in the area, especially with all the bad lunch choices....So try it out and decide for yourself. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It was good. Not like amazingly good. But good. Good ambiance. Good service. Good but complicated looking menu. I had the pasta special (spaghetti bologna) and my wife had the gnocchi. They were good. The spaghetti wasn't $25 good but the gnocchi was fairly priced. The old fashioned I had was not very good. It was almost pure bourbon which I don't mind, but it wasn't the best old fashioned I've ever had. My wife's wine was good too.  We probably won't be back for dinner but I suggest checking it out. Just order something that's worth it and don't drink an old fashioned."}
{"text":"Love eating here. Great Portuguese fast food. I always get the bifana its delicious. Good music.  What sucks is that theres no bathrooms.. but other then that its my go to spot for when im hungry and craving good portuguese food"}
{"text":"Even though Campo is dangerously close to my house, I had been avoiding it for awhile, not sure if it had improved from its predecessor, Camp.  A friend suggested to try it for a catch up dinner and I was over all impressed.  We made reservations for 7:15pm and were seated right away at a table for two in the cozy dining room.  From the daily menu, we chose to start off with appetizers - roasted cauliflower salad ($13), lobster and shrimp salad ($15) and selection of olives ($4).  We also ordered  glasses of the red and white house wines ($10).     The cauliflower salad was amazing...a generous portion dressed in an addictive vinaigrette, and very timely as my Facebook feed that day had been littered with posts about $5 heads of cauliflower.   Lobster and shrimp salad also very fresh and tasty.  I was pretty stuffed after the 2 salad so we decided to split a main - daily fish with white beans and kale ($27).  Fish was nicely cooked with a crispy skin and the beans/kale were an appropriate accompaniment.  We thought about skipping dessert but glad we didn't when we dug into salted caramel budino ($6).  Heavenly caramel pudding with whipped cream and crispy peanuts.  Almost considered ordering a portion to myself.  Service throughout dinner was very attentive with appropriate water glass filling.  I was still reeling from our horrible service at Ruby Watcho the week previous so it was great to be gently brought back to a great dining experience with kind service.  Looking forward to coming back to Campo for a brunch in the near future."}
{"text":"Portuguese grilled chicken comes to downtown Montreal? AW YEAH!  I love me some rotisserie chicken Portuguese-style but in Montreal the best places tend to all be in the Plateau neighbourhood.  That is why I was delighted when I spotted Campo while walking down de Maisonneuve one day.  The owners of this place are the same ones of Cafe Ferreira, an upscale restaurant in the downtown core.  The place is a little on the small side and it gets packed during the office lunch rush.  It might be best to just get your food to go because seating will be at a premium here.  The line-up is long but they do a decent job of handling the volume of customers that descend upon this place.  Now let's talk food.  Chicken is the star here so if you're not in the mood for that make plans to go elsewhere.  I got a chicken sandwich with fries and a nata for dessert because natas are awesome and who could say no to them?  The chicken sandwich was delicious to say the least.  The chicken was juicy and tender on the inside but the exterior had a charred, grilled taste to it.  They also did a great job with the seasoning and I was a fan of the special Campo sauce that they put on it.  The fries were crispy and had just the right amount of salt while the nata satisfied my craving for something sweet.  It is a little pricey for my liking.  Lunch was about $16 which is definitely more expensive then some of the Portuguese chicken places in the Plateau.  Another thing that I find weird is that if you get a combo you have to pay extra for a drink because the combo only includes the chicken or sandwich, fries and a salad.  Maybe customers could be given the choice between a dessert, salad or drink instead?  With the prices I doubt I'll be here week in and week out for lunch simply because I prefer not to spend too much when I eat out for lunch at work.  I will definitely come back when I'm in the mood for a splurge though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   A definite nice local spot in the west end of the Toronto.  I would say that most people dont realize a good restaurant is here as there's very little near it other than Toronto urban suburbs.  The locals definitely know about it as it was pretty packed on a random Thursday evening at 8 pm.  This quaint place focuses on a small and refined Italian menu that only has 1 or 2 dishes per type (salad, appetizer, primi pasta, and entree).  I do recommend to grab a reservation as the restaurant is equally as small.  There are maybe 10 to 14 tables with most being 2 seating only.  I would say that you are definitely snug here... If there is a loud couple, you will hear them ... A LOT.  If anything, I would say its a big draw back.  The acoustics make this more of a loud bar like atmosphere instead of a romantic intimate space.  We had one couple that just made it near impossible to have a conversation.  We were across the restaurant from them.  I cannot imagine what it is like to sit only 6 inches away from them.    Arugula salad - Possibly the best dish of the night.  Flavourful and lightly dressed that balances the nice natural sweetness of the peaches.  I liked the addition of the crunchy almonds that give it a nice nutty note and a good texture to the crisp lettuce.  4/5  Cauliflower soup - Their daily offering was a cauliflower soup with a bit of smoked fish added.  The smoked fish was a nice touch and really help elevate the flavour overall... otherwise it would have been pretty bland.  3.5/5  Gnocchi - I've had a few excellent gnocchi in Italy recently and this gnocchi was executed well.  Bite sized fluffy and light without being too chewy or doughy.  I really enjoyed the dumplings.  The sauce is a bright gleaming red but it was a bit too light on actual flavour.  I would have loved a bit more spice to it.  3.5/5  Meatball & Polenta - Meaty and large in portion, this is a hefty dish.  It looks deceivingly light but the meatballs are dense and larger than a golfball.  It feels more like a small burger patty than anything.  Though generous in nature, I found the meatball touch dry and chewier.  The polenta was very smooth and creamy... definitely could have used more of the tomato sauce to give is a flavour lift. 3.5/5  Tiramisu - A very interesting take as it does an open tiramisu where the savoiardi cookies were left relatively untouched and unsoaked between the filling.  It had a nice balance between the crunchy cookie and the creamy filling and a good kick of coffee to flavour it.  It wasn't large so it be a nice ending to the meal.  3.5/5  For the price, I did find it on the more expensive side and approaching the same prices I found in the best places in Toronto.  It didnt hit the same tastes or flavours as those places.  Though everything here is good, I wouldnt necessarily trek back here for a return visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a cozy atmosphere. The staff are attentive and welcoming. Smaller portions than many places, but satisfying. A great option for a drink, brunch or dinner. I love their budino dessert - rich and velvety goodness!"}
{"text":"I so would've wanted to be blown away by Campo. I had such high expectations. It's in my building and I love Portuguese chicken. I would've been there everyday.  For the good:  - I love the restaurant itself. The setting is beautiful. - The chicken is good. - The fries are good, albeit the greasy good kind. - 13$ for a combo would be reasonable for a good lunch  Now the bad:  - I went the 2nd day after opening, the process was understandably disorganized. That's not an issue. The issue is that the process is weird. You walk in and: 1) you order at one end of the counter, 2) go pay at the other end of the counter and 3) return to the 1st place to get your food. That's so counter-productive. What's wrong with 1) order and pay, 2) get your food and be on your way!  - The sandwich is 80% bread and 20% meat. Oh no! That was such a disappointment. Put some of that delicious chicken inside your sandwich!!   - The combo doesn't include a drink! WTF? The combo is sandwich + fries + salad. You don't make friends with salad. Salad sucks. Give me a exciting drink to go with my  delicious sandwich!    In conclusion: The chicken sandwich is good, but you don't get nearly enough chicken in it.   I'm going to try the poutine next time."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic date night with hubby at Campo this past Friday! The sangria was on point. My husband loved the Country Toast which had puréed tomatoes, manchego cheese, anchovies and prosciutto. It was a melt in your mouth combination. The octopus salad had super fresh tender morsels of octopus and crisp greens, perfectly balanced dressing. I had the gnocchi and my husband had the meatballs & polenta. Both were delicious. I know other reviews may have mentioned they felt the meatball dish was overpriced for 3 meatballs, but we felt they were quite large & filling. And to top it all off, the best authentic tiramisu we've had in a long time. This place is a true neighbour hood gem at Jane and Annette and we can't wait to be back! Next time we'll probably request a different seat if possible though. We had the table for 2 right by the entrance to the kitchen area so servers were constantly walking in and our beside us and I found the bright white light from the kitchen to be very distracting, maybe some curtains would help!"}
{"text":"Ate there Saturday night - 8:30pm reservation - ate at the bar. Very friendly staff - busy vibe - small restaurant. Bright fun atmosphere.   Food - ordered the orecchiette - with shrimp and chorizo. You'd expect that the pasta might have some shrimp and chorizo in it? This restaurant should be embarrassed by what they served - deeply embarrassed. It was as if they took 1 small shrimp and 1 slice of chorizo - and then diced them up into tiny little pieces. It was barely noticeable. Never have I ordered a shrimp and chorizo pasta with such a skimpy cheap portion of ingredients! Bland - boring - bad.  My friend ordered the salmon. It was overdone. Over cooked.   The place gets good reviews and maybe it was an off night. But it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Not good. Pasta for $23 shouldn't have 2-3 tiny shrimps, few pieces of diced chorizo and store bought pasta from the box. There are so many restaurants in the city, which offer house made pasta with quality ingredients for the same price (or less). The service was good, the space was nice, but it was very cold in the dining room. I won't return."}
{"text":"Guys and gals, this is a seriously SUBPAR Portugese chicken place ran by a businessman with obviously no kitchen experience or culinary skills.  The GOOD: The design at this place is on point, best looking Portugese chicken place I've been to. That is obviously the work of whoever they hired to do the design. I like the logo (refer to my photos).  The sauce they squeeze (from a squeeze bottle) on their chicken is pretty good. It's not spicy, but it was the only flavourful element on the chicken so yeah, I liked it.  The BAD: Chicken is small, a bit overcooked (mushy texture), and dry.   The way they store/warm their cooked chicken is also troubling me. It's stored in a (hopefully) heated tray left in open air (tray is not covered). The chicken I got was lukewarm.  They are 3 people in the cooking area, they work like confused snails, and the food comes out at an amateur rate. This restaurant has been open since September 2016, it's been 6months. How are they still so incompetent?  The half chicken, salad and fries is considered a combo, and they sell it for 15$. It's more expensive than any other portugese chicken place I can think of, and that is OK since it's in downtown, but what is NOT OK is the far inferior quality and quantity of food. You can get a whole chicken for 5$ at any supermarket. For some reason, I was charged 18.40$ total for this 15$ combo. What. I only realized after I left that 15$ + taxes is not as high as 18.40$.   Man, I don't remember the last time I felt like I needed to share a review right after eating there."}
{"text":"Living around Campo, I was excited to have another option for Portugese chicken in the area. However, the food left something to be desired. The fries were criminally underseasoned and seemed undercooked in the middle, although they were decently crispy. The \"salad\" was literally chopped lettuce with a variant of thousand island dressing -- seriously? As for the chicken, the supposed star of the show, the meat was rather sparse and, on the whole, lacking in flavour. That being said, the skin was tasty enough.   They're new and probably still ironing out some of the kinks, so I suppose I should give them some degree of freedom... But meh. I can definitely get better chicken for a fraction of the price elsewhere. At least the customer service was friendly, and the interior was nice. Kudos to them for using hormone-free, grain-fed chicken."}
