{"text":"Great bar and cafe. The martini was spot on and the service is attentive and professional. I have not had smoked swordfish in quite some time and the B Style carpaccio is wonderful . Best food we have had in this area. Shout out to Stefano our waiter !"}
{"text":"We enjoyed an evening here between the wine, food, and service. They pay great attention to fresh and local ingredients. We ordered the charcuterie and cheese misto plate and they sliced the meats with a deli slicer fresh for the plate. The cheeses were excellent, a great assortment of hard and soft, salty and creamy. We also split the Pizzocheri, a local pasta dish made with butter, cheese, cabbage, potatoes and coste. It was delicious. Nice atmosphere, decorated with tasteful Italian flair. Wine list was excellent featuring boutique wineries. Service was attentive, very friendly!"}
