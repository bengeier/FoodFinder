{"text":"Restaurant is moving to another location soon\".  I'd call ahead to see where they are"}
{"text":"I really like this place and when I am in the mood to vist a \"chippy\", this place is at the tops of my list. The portions are generous, the batter always crisp and not oily, plus the chips are top notch, hand cut, as well. You can get green tea here, which is nice change from a soft drink, or regular tea or coffee."}
{"text":"good news, they're now open, moved to 95 lebovic, close to Rona,  fish has an excellent crispy batter, chips are crunchy and had a good creamy coleslaw too, same menu as before  come check them out, there are more tables and washrooms are right there too,"}
{"text":"I've had the haddock and chips here and it was really tasty. As well the portion was good, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area in the mood for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Greatest fish market chips in Toronto.  Bar none. That is all there is too it. The batter is the greatest we have ever had. Try it now!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. They make amazing fish and chips. The best in the area.   The fish portion size is generous for haddock.  The batter is great as well. If you like the fries well done like me, just ask, and they'll happily accommodate.   My only real quip is that their tarter sauce is in packets, which is tough to open after eating. The sauce is good, I just would like it in a better in a squeeze bottle."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the fish and chips here very underrated place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has not closed it just relocated. It used to be in this dilapidated plaza on pharmacy but has now moved into a brand new space close to Rona. The fish and chips here are the best I've ever had (even compared to the ones I had in England)! I got two pieces of halibut with and order of fries and it was delicious!! The batter is not too heavy or oily which can sine times be a concern when having fish and chips.   The only gripe I have is that it's a bit on the expensive side. 2 pieces of halibut and fries came up to about $25. It's not really enough to split between two people. This is a delicious treat to have once in a while."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips! The batter here is nice and fluffy close to a tempura type consistency but for sure it is not tempura batter, I have tried to sweet talk the owner into telling me his secret but no success yet!  They are also moving in December 2015. The new location will be near lebovic and comstock right outside the Rona, the closest major intersection is warden and eglinton.  I'm super excited to find out the new items that Hamish's will be adding to their menu!  I posted their new location poster in the photo's section."}
{"text":"Order: Haddock & fries The fish was done perfectly to my liking, it had a light batter and was delicious. I forgot to take a photo, but it was a generous portion (even for me). I think they use frozen fries unlike a lot of fish & chip places, but they were also very good.  I am very happy I decided to try this place and will definitely be returning to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Halibut and fries came up to $12. Hit the spot. The Haddock n' a few chips - fries are the same amount with a regular order. Maybe its because we came at 7 p.m. (When theres 20 minutes of service left, I guess) My order was $9.65. Just water with a tip = $32 for two in a booth. Not bad but nothing spectacular, just like Duckworths."}
{"text":"This location is now closed. A new Indian restaurant opened in it's place. It is very good. Much better than fish and chips."}
