{"text":"Great family owned breakfast place for the quality/quantity of food and price. My go to is the specialty omelettes despite the great early bird deals. Lunch sandwiches are very good especially the club. Staff is friendly. Lots of seating."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the cook obviously knows how to cook sunny eggs properly.  The wait staff was not to enthusiastic.  The slogan is, \"we reserve the right not to smile before 11am\".  And, they abide by this rule.  Very few people in the place and it took forever to get offered more coffee.  I think they were more interested in chatting up friends.  Anyway, would have rated higher because the food was good; wait staff needs work. And, it was like 80 degrees on the place. Weak! And, cost more than other places."}
{"text":"Daybreak has had a makeover! It's now bright yellow and has a half wall down the middle, so it's not so open.  It still has the same great menu and same great prices. I've had a lot of items off this menu and I've never been disappointed. Portions are decent and the food is always fresh and hot. The only item on the menu that needs more are the fruit crepes. It's not quite enough on its own.   They offer 2 kinds of homefries, deep-fried or grilled...grilled is the way to go! The coffee is ok.   Service is always good, pretty consistent. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Mothers Day- Service was terrible. I got the wrong meal- twice. The third time i just left my plate there uneaten and gave up on trying to get my correct meal. My grandmother got an egg sandwich- ate half of it to realize the other half didn't have any egg on it whatsoever. They refused to replace it or refund it. They chalked up the errors to it being busy (Mothers Day). I was not impressed that the manager wouldn't budge or apologize. This was a while ago tho, so hopefully things have since improved!"}
{"text":"Solid place to eat breakfast if you tell them exactly how to cook everything. For example: scrambled eggs well done, bacon crispy but not burnt, hash browns fried well but not burnt, and toast actually toasted with butter.  Actually order exactly what you expect to get. This'll ensure you get the good you want for the price you want."}
{"text":"Inspiring? No. Solid breakfast option for a quick hangover breakfast? Absolutely.  I am intrigued by homemade pierogi on the menu and will have to return to give those a go."}
{"text":"We had the jack broccoli omelette and the club sandwich. Pretty good club actually. The omelette was a bit overdone but the broccoli was very fresh. Diner coffee was nothing special. I think the open concept was a bit off putting. Felt like a cafeteria in Eastern Europe. Not bad if you are hungry and really want something but there are other better spots in Whitby."}
{"text":"I don't know which was worst, the food or the service. The Broccoli Jack Omelette was bland and tasteless, home fries were half cooked and worst Souvlaki ever! soft drinks were served in cans or plastic bottles."}
{"text":"Went a few times and it was fine then I tried ham with my eggs and got fried salty luncheon meat...  I decided to go up to counter and ask for something else and made the mistake of saying the ham was lousy and the cook/owner went apopolyptic...  Never going back"}
