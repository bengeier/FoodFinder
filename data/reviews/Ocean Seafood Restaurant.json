{"text":"My Rate: 1st Service 2nd Clean 3rd Food 4th Price  Service: Service was VERY VERY horrible before and after being seated. We had to ask more times for a menu and order food ...... total about take 20 mins. Also, all waitress seem don't want to work here .... no smile no service.  Clean: Dinner room A-OK but very LOUD! That night, we had 5 people went there but they gave us a side table for 4 .... so we felt uncomfortable ( resturant not full, I think they want to hold a large table for other walk-in people )!!  Food: I just can say food not good but not really bad!! Um ... Oily Oily Oliy and also salty ... if table for 5 and order 5 dishes were not enough .... there portion was SO small.  Price: They only give you a Combo menu for 4 dishes, 6 dishes .... Need to ask for side order menu .... but they seem not want to give you ( bcos price cheaper than combo)!  About a month ago, I read this restaurant review was different .... I think someone remove a bad review .... I hope that my review dont remove by no reason !! That my comment after visit and want to share !! I keep a copy for this ...haha!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for another good choice. No thanks to Google maps who sent us on a wild goose chase on a dark and rainy night. Type in the exact address. Don't rely on google default for the restaurant location.  I rarely write reviews but I did enjoy dinner with my family and felt service was good (I don't expect much service from Chinese restaurants). We made reservations and arrived to find the table set up and ready for us. We ordered a set meal with lobster and added extra dishes. It was all good. The restaurant was clean and bright. It was busy but anytime we asked for something. We got it and within a reasonable time. Also we read that parking might be an issue but we had no problem finding a spot in the underground lot."}
{"text":"Over crowded during dinner time on weekends Definitely violated building occupancy code.  Decor A little fancier and also a little dated.  Food Ok not the best (did not order seafood)  Service Typical Asian"}
{"text":"Good price, good food Hong Kong Style restaurant!    Having a great chef, the taste is so nice.  A lot of Hong Kong style variety.  If you are looking for the Hong Kong taste, this is one of the Hong Kong style restaurant you must visit."}
{"text":"Authentic Hong Kong Cafe restaurant.    It's NOT a dim sum place but serve Hong Kong Chinese-Western fusion fast food. It's equivalent of Swiss Chalet rather than McDonald's.  The \"Western\" part of the menu is limited to mostly breakfast though.   The restaurant is big w/ 100+ seats and busy.  We came in with 8 people (3 groups) in line for seating and it's a only a 5 minutes wait.  The waitstaff are efficient and helpful.  The food came in quick.  Overall the service is great.   The food is as authentic as you can get in Toronto.  Probably better than anywhere else in the world other than in Hong Kong.  We ordered fish filet soup, a fish dish, and fried rice noodles.  All are very tasty.    The price is quite low comparing to the quality and quantity of the food.  Cash only.   Definitely will come back if in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times! I always think this place is alright. So i will explain why I will never return to this restaurant! I will be rating according to food, atmosphere and service!  Food -1.5/5 : honestly nothing special! We got the friend pork chop and it was so dry! We also got the steam eel and It was really not that fresh! We got this vegetable dish and it was super oily as well!   Atmosphere 1.5/5 : Nothing special and not especially clean.   Service 0/5 : horrible service! First there wasn't that many people in the restaurant, but our food didn't come out till probably almost 30 minutes. All the servers walked around like wandering when trying to get their attention they kind of look past year. One thing that totally ticked me off was when they gave us our bill. Our bill came up to about 58 dollar which is decent. When we gave $70 the person looked at the bill and said \"this isn't enough tip\" (in Mandarin). My Mandarin is a little off and I looked at her she looks at the bill again and said the same thing again. This time I caught what she was saying. I looked at with a \"wtf\" face. Once again she looks at the bill and she turned to us and said \"Oh, sorry I miss read the bill\". In my opinion I do not care if you misread the bill or not you do not comment on how much people tip you. I am one of the most generous tippers, but hate when servers comment on how much people tip to them! I watched the lady that made the rude remarks and she wouldn't bring us our change and handed to a colleague to do it. In my opinion own up to what you did and bring us our change!    All in all, I am usually willing to give restaurants more than one try, but when it comes to bad and rude service I will never return! This will definitely be my last time visiting this place. My parents and friends will also not be returning! Overall 1/5 is being generous I feel!   Sorry for the rant. I don't always rant, but when I do I can go on and on and on......"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here while I was waiting for someone early one morning, had breakfast, pretty sure this is not what this place was meant for but the food was extremely cheap but terrible. Please save yourself and do not order sausage or eggs."}
{"text":"I like the lunch options/combos. They're very fast. Their restaurant is full most of the time. Lower priced food, tastes average."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place for breakfast and takeout.   They have a takeout only menu and it's totally worth it. They have many to chose from.  I usually order their satay beef rice noodle and bean curd with assorted meat pot.  Staff are always friendly and food is always satisfying.  One of the best Chinese place in the plaza."}
{"text":"I work in the area and often find myself here for lunch. The prices are good, the servings generous and the food is decent. I especially like their combos where you can get a main course and a drink for around $6!  The restaurant is relatively clean. Service is similar to other Chinese restaurants (not good) but for the price, you can't complain!"}
{"text":"I came here multiple times. Food is reasonably priced and I like their cheap breakfast menu. Lunch and afternoon tea is alright. Note that they don't offer anymore hot HK style tea after afternoon tea time. For dinner you will be forced to order from their regular menu which is good too. Food is satisfactory and serves its purpose of filling your belly for an OK price. Not extravagant. But it's a good place to go when you're out of ideas."}
{"text":"I am often intrigued by Hong Kong style caf√©s because their dishes are influenced by the British Empire.  Having been a British colony for over 150 years, Hong Kong culture has typically been called, \"East meets West.\"  The food is no exception. What other Chinese establishment has Westernized breakfast items such as bacon, eggs, macaroni, spaghetti, and luncheon meat?    I personally crave those unique baked rice dishes - rice on the bottom, meat and vegetables on top, all smothered in a rich sauce and baked to perfection.  When done correctly, the sauce bubbles and has burnt brown spots which add a \"crunchy\" texture to every bite!  A popular choice is usually baked pork chops on rice with a tomato sauce. This visit, I opted for baked chicken with Portuguese  sauce on rice ($5.99). The Portuguese sauce was delicious - it tasted like a mild curry coconut sauce.   You get amazing value with these dishes as they are all in the $5 to $6 range. Included in your price is a coffee or tea - an extra charge of $0.70 is added for a cold drink. I requested for a black milk tea.   During my visit, I also ordered a fried rice noodle with beef and soy sauce ($5.99 - which also includes a free drink). It was up to par in taste when compared with most Chinese establishments but it was noticeable more greasy than desired.   The service is typical for most Chinese establishments - efficient yet usually not very personable. This visit, one of the dishes came significantly later than the other, which took away from the experience.   All in all, I would still return for those signature baked dishes - the next time I get a craving."}
{"text":"4.5 I didn't expect spectacular service, knowing that lack of service is kind of the norm for Chinese restaurants... and thus I wasn't disappointed. Washrooms are clean. YAY Food was delicious YAY Portions were huge YAY Prices were cheap (and some surprising specials) YAY The best are the late lunch specials :D I usually end up with enough food to pack home for dinner...  which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Foods are delicious and price is good!!!! 3 ppl are all fullllllll for only about $30, and we even pack some foods up. The services are pretty good too, but with not much smile. It's the food that make my day~"}
{"text":"Every dish is high quality.  No bad things here. Very busy , need reservation.  Their dinner menu is the best  Love their MeiJi Lobster combo.  Such a great deal and great food.  I go there every two weeks."}
{"text":"My family usually comes here for their combos and it's usually enough food to feed us over 2 meals at a great price! If you want affordable Chinese food, this is the place to go.   On my last visit here with my girlfriend, we ordered 3 dishes, a brocolli dish (with fried tofu and shrimp), a stone pot dish (garoupa fish with tofu and bean curd) and a fried pork chop dish along with a bowl of white rice. To add to the food, a complimentary bowl of vegetable soup came with our order too. All of this came to roughly $30 after tax and tips which is decent!   The food itself was really tasty too, the brocolli dish was the best dish in my opinion out of the 3 that we ordered ($8.99). It came with a generous portion of shrimp and the tofu was fried really well.   All in all, this place is one of the best at getting a great deal."}
{"text":"This place provides excellent value and food all day long. After 9 pm on weekdays, they had discount of 10%. Only cash is accepted.  The 4 and 6 persons combo really got good selections. Basically you picked one main entry such as Pejink duck, crab, lostser or steam fish and then a few other dishes from the list.  I would normally go there at least once when I am in town."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is pretty good.  The price is decent and most of the specials come with a coffee or tea.  This place is always busy from what I've been told. I come here at 2:30 in the afternoon and it was full. They run different specials throughout the day which keeps people coming. They only take cash though.  Most of their specials run between 5 and 6 dollars.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"My group, we were the only white/non-Asian people there lol No offense, I got nothing against Chinese people. I guess we were in the Chinatown part of markham The Peking duck was amazeballs! You get to make your own fajitas/wraps. Good soup too."}
{"text":"The amount of times I come here in a month is ridiculous. The amount of times my boyfriend comes here in a week is even more ridiculous. The food is cheap and decent, and service is usually pretty fast. I am obsessed with their chicken wings and French toast (which is only offered during afternoon tea hours), as well as their all day breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Cheap eats right in downtown Richmond Hill! Totally value. You can get a rice noodle and a drink for 5$. Menu selection is generous. I ordered the satay beef noodle with cold milk tea. I would say the quality is decent for the price! Service was fast, efficient, and friendly. (Be careful of their satay sauce on the side...I underestimated the spiciness!) Cash only."}
{"text":"IT'S SO CHEEEEAP! Each dish averages around $5 give or take. And because of that the food is good but not gourmet...but the portions are decent!  I had baked pork chop on spaghetti with black pepper sauce...the sauce was scarily dark and a bit too salty but overall it was pretty good. My mom had the beef satay udon noodles with eggs and buttered toast. The toast was essentially dry white bread with a spot of butter soaked in the middle...  This place was uber-busy at lunch, fortunately we had beat the line-up!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a family dinner. It's clean, the seafood is fresh, and the staff are friendly. It's a typical Chinese restaurant with Hong Kong style food. We reserved a table for six for 7 PM and were seated eight minutes after that.  We ordered the Double Lobster Combo for 6, which includes live double lobsters, fried clam in black bean sauce, steamed chicken (half), grouper slice with corn, beef ribs in garlic sweet sauce, and mixed mushrooms w/ Chinese vegetables.   The lobsters and clams were very fresh, however there was a bit too much sauce in the clams. The steamed chicken was tender. The beef ribs was one of the better tasting ones I've had; having a tasty sweet sauce and the beef was lean and fresh. The mixed mushrooms were also cooked very nicely and paired well with the Chinese vegetables.   We also ordered additional dishes like tofu and broccoli with mushrooms, sweet and sour pork, and sticky rice. The tofu was freshly fried and wasn't fully covered in the sauce which was good. The sweet and sour pork was lean and crispy, and the sticky rice was flavourful.   I was very pleased with the service and the quality of the food. Will be back again."}
{"text":"A regular spot for me and my family - convenient, reliable, and quick. Nothing stellar, but nothing so atrocious that has turned me away. A typical Chinese casual diner/restaurant with Hong Kong style food - more diner style during the day, more restaurant at night. Saturday night found me returning for dinner, it was a short wait before we were seated. Service is minimal - flag someone down as needed, be patient as they're always short staffed, and dinner time is always a full house.  To start the meal there's daily soup on the house - usually a Chinese pork-based soup with carrots and some other fix-ins. Typically quite tasty, with a great home-cooked feeling.  Ordered a combo dinner (Edit: the combo for 4 meals are the best deal! Consider getting one and adding a few dishes if you've got a lot more people) featuring steamed bass, sweet and sour pork, wolfberry and fish soup bok choy, and roast duck (we substituted with roast chicken instead, a few dollars extra). Portions were good for the price and group of four appetite. The bass was tasty and had good texture, was not overcooked. Everything else was average - nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about either. The roast chicken paled in comparison to my recent visit to Mr Congee, but was still acceptable for a casual/whatever standard.  Going with the fad at other similar places they have dessert on the house as well - here they usually have a green bean based dessert soup with a type of pungent green...it's not to my liking but easy to make in bulk and most patrons enjoy it. Again, home-cooked feelings, but a bit too green for me...  Compared to other \"congee\" places, this is somewhere on the top two of my list, given its close proximity to home and reliable menu items. I prefer the spot for lunch and afternoon tea over dinner, but will return soon for sure for any meal of the day."}
{"text":"I've been to Ocean on many occasions, just because it's quite close to where I live. Their afternoon tea menu is pretty decent - I usually get the fried chicken wings with salad, along with iced lemon tea. Not bad for the price. The dinner menu is also decent and always comes with complimentary Chinese soup to start. They have some set dinners for 4 that come with either lobster, crab, Peking duck, or fish.  Quality of the food is okay for the price you pay, although I do feel that they have gone downhill in the past year. Good place to bring your family on days when you just can't decide what to eat."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Nothing special. I prefer the quality at competing Chinese restaurants. In particular the 2 beef dishes we ordered were pretty bad. One was way too salty, and the other was too tough. But the fish, pork and noodle dishes were fine.   I'll still give it 3 stars because the prices are very reasonable. Lots of dishes under $10"}
{"text":"A good place for a meal, whether lunch or dinner. Seems more like a Hong Kong style cafe for lunch though.   The area is quite large, and can accommodate larger groups if necessary. Not a lot of waiting room for tables when they are busy, so making a reservation may be wise for larger groups.   Have been here a couple times, and the food overall is quite good. A good quality for the price you pay.  The service here is mediocre though, with the food coming out quick, but the lack of attention is evident. Had to ask a couple times for more tea as they don't give you your own pot at lunch.   A nice place to check out if you want something on the inexpensive side, but want a nice environment than a cafe."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this restaurant.  We found there is a huge difference in quality of the food when eating in and taking out.  When taking out it tastes like what you could get at the food courts.  It seems greasier and soggier.  Needless to say we no longer get take out but eat in a few times a month.  We've done family dinner here a few times as well and the food is pretty good for the value.  The restaurant is also bright and clean which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"The set dinner for two and up are excellent!!  They have excellent choices and are well made! The come with a complimentary soup that taste awesome. Dishes are well made and at a timely manner!! This is one of my fAvorite places!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my parents recently and we loved it.  We ordered a 5 lb lobster salt and pepper style ($16.99 per pound = $84.95) and a lobster roe fried rice ($8).    The lobster was huge.  It was chopped up, battered and deep fried.  The lobster tasted very fresh and the meat was firm.  The batter wasn't too salty and it was slightly spicy.  There was fried sliced garlic and pepper flakes sprinkled on top.  The lobster was so delicious.  The salt and pepper style is dry (which I prefer).  They also have ginger and scallion style, but this is wet/in a gravy.  The other style they have is Hong Kong style which will run you an extra $5.    The lobster roe rice was also delicious.  It had a strong lobster aroma and wasn't overly salty despite being speckled with roe.    At the start of meal they brought us some complimentary soup.  It was mostly broth with a few pieces of carrots.  There was a piece of sugar cane in the soup, but I'm pretty sure this was to add flavour and you're not supposed to eat it.  I found the soup unusual, but oddly delicious and addictive.  It tasted like pork bone soup.  There was no actual meat in the soup though.  Servers are very polite and efficient.  They cleared away our lobster shells throughout the meal.  Not all staff speak English though, but they have staff who do, so if you ask a question and they don't understand, they will get someone else to come and help you.  There's free parking, although it's in a strip mall with other restaurants, bakeries and a grocery store, so spots fill up fast.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and would come back."}
{"text":"Another good, not great, Cantonese seafood restaurant that's opened about a month ago. Prices very reasonable, cash only.   We ordered one of the combo dinners for 6 people; for $69.99 you get a lot of food:   -- soup of the day (typical Cantonese homemade soup, pretty good)  -- One large Vancouver crab (you pick the cooking style, including ginger-onion stir fry, HK style spicy, etc. The one we had was meaty and flavourful)  -- Steamed whole fish  -- beef spare ribs, Korean style  -- stir fried Chinese greens with garlic  -- stewed Chinese eggplant and shrimp in a clay pot  -- crispy-fried chicken (1/2 of a chicken, at least)   Service was kinda slow. All the wait staff were running around looking super busy, but I can't help feeling being ignored. Under-staffed?"}
{"text":"This is a place famous for their tasty Cantonese cuisine with inexpensive price. If you don't know what to order, go with their chef recommended combo menu. It is a very popular place so if you don't want to wait, go off-hours. I personally love their stir fry stuff, and seafood dishes. The only two downsides are: 1. They don't accept cards, cash only. 2. Service is not there yet. But again, don't expect much service from Chinese restaurants anyway, and a lot Chinese restaurants with good price are cash only. To me, most important is food is fresh and delicious, with a good price. If that is your goal, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Five of us got the 4-person lobster meal and added the bitter melon beef dish. Great value and very tasty food! For the lobster we went with salt and pepper flavour and I loved it. The meal also came with sweet and sour pork (average), chicken with salt dip (good) and bok choi with garlic (good). There was also soup to start which I really liked. The bitter melon dish was nice - lots of slices of bitter melon and they stir fry it with black bean sauce. All of this plus two bowls of white rice was about $80 including tax. Amazing value!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices at this place but for some reason the quality is not up to par with other Chinese restaurants.  Portions do seem smaller."}
{"text":"I visit a lot of Chinese restaurants but have always been forgetful to review them because of 2 reasons: a) I often don't know their English names b) Their menu items are hard to describe in English. Fortunately I figured out this place's English name so I am able to review it.   This restaurant has some of the best prices I've ever seen. EVER! You can get a plate of fried rice/noodles for $5.75-$8. Decent portions. Most of their dishes are under $10. Between the 2 times we've been here, we ordered Steamed fish ($10.99), fried rice once and fried noodles once, hot pot tofu with shrimp, fried fish (don't know how to translate), bittermelon beef, and salted pepper shrimps. It averages out to be $10/person after tax/tip.   Admittedly the food quality is not the best, but it's far from the worst. The steamed fish was VERY good and it would typically cost over $20 for a whole fresh fish. The noodles had too much \"sauce\" on it but otherwise very good in terms of ingredients used. Everything else was decent.  For the non-Chinese here, I should mention that Chinese food is not primarily concerned about decoration. Many dishes will NOT be arranged in an artistic way. Service is also never a critical factor to the average Chinese person. Don't expect dedicated servers to ask you how you are doing. When it's busy, expect to put some effort into flagging down a server. This is normal. Eating out for most Chinese people is a family affair, and to celebrate events like birthdays. It's a chance to try foods that are difficult or inconvenient to make at home. I'm saying all this because no one should measure a Chinese restaurant by \"Western\" standards. It's simply incompatible."}
{"text":"This restaurant time and time again has been my staple. From childhood until now, I've been able to order lots of meat and veg options, authentically made at rediculously low prices. I'd recommend the baked Portuguese chicken and Cantonese Fried Noodles."}
{"text":"I came here for an impromptu lunch in a group of 9. It was very busy considering it was a weekday but even so luckily we had no trouble getting a large table with no reservations. They had some pretty decent lunch specials in which the meal comes with a free hot coffee or tea (additional cost if cold or honey lemon added). Lunch specials averages around $6-10 depending on what you choose. Portions are huge and can definitely be shared. We ordered a bunch of things to share including: fried rice noodles and seafood in XO sauce, Fukin-style fried rice, Shanghai noodles, beef chow fun, and a chow mein of some sort. You would think that when you order around 6 dishes you would come across something you like - NEGATIVE. Everything tasted similar and was completely not memorable. Blah. I was pouring on hot sauce just to make the food a little more interesting. It is nothing but food that just fills your stomach and takes up space. At least the drinks were okay.   It is your typical loud Chinese restaurant with crappy service. The waitress seemed overwhelmed and was kind of rude. Plus she kept forgetting things like the cups of water and forks we asked for and not apologetic about it.   FYI: The day I came here (7/12/16) there was sign at the door that the credit card machine was down. I'm not sure if it has been fixed since then."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the area hands down! And if you know a better one then please enlighten me :-)  I came with few friends to this diner, We ordered one huge bowl of soup to share and each of us ordered rice and different plates that we shared with each others.  Food tastes like authentic Chinese food and not the bastardized version of it. Portions are generous especially for soups. Greens are oiled up looking all sexy. Complimentary tea as usual with all Chinese restaurants.  Decor so elegant you think you are dining with the riches. But prices are reasonable and lots of dishes on the menu are less than $10.   I absolutely recommend this restaurant for anyone in the area"}
{"text":"They are not worthy of any stars. Witnessed waitress and a customer use washroom without washing her hands. If that's not enough to convince you to stay away, their Peiking duck was tasteless; the flour tortilla was thick and stale. What a waste of money..."}
{"text":"We would have finished our dinner over at Shanghai Dim Sum but their service was lousy. So, we just walked around and stumbled into this place. The service here was 10000x better. The food was pretty darned good too. At least the staff was friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed the dining experience and will definitely be back again before we head out of town."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, spacious, waitress is nice too. Line up can be long but the free WiFi is fast. Price is cheap and food quality is good and serves fast."}
{"text":"Amazing food here for a great price. Try any of the beef dishes such as gai-lan (chinese broccoli) + Beef for example.  Great! Lunch specials such as spaghetti meat sauce and macaroni are great as well"}
{"text":"This is getting four stars for the price to quality ratio.  Food quality in itself is probably 3 stars.  Good choice for Cantonese style food.  We ordered beef short ribs (similar to kalbi), eggplant and shrimp in hot pot and yeung chow fried rice.  Portions were plentiful and it was all for less than 24 bucks, including taxes.  Oh yeah, also came with complementary Cantonese style soup.  Service is somewhat lacking, however for the price, I wouldn't expect too much more.  Will visit again.  The only downside is that it is cash only.    However, I will visit again since its good food for a cheap price"}
{"text":"Deserves a 3.5 stars. This has recently become my go-to to get quick, cheap and decent HK-style food (and their milk tea) at all hours - breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, or dinner.   For the past, I would say, 7 years, I did not once step foot in this restaurant even though I lived so close cos I had had a horrible experience dining here once. Don't remember the details but just remembered it was bad food and service. Fast forward to 2017, I now have a 180 degree change of opinion on this place! In hindsight, I probably just got there on the wrong day at the wrong time.   My favourite thing to get here is their pork chop noodle in soup with HK milk tea for $4.79 plus tax (see pic). The pork chop was nicely flavoured and tender enough in a decent portion that can fill you up for under $5. Their 3 treasure noodle (which includes fish tofu, beef balls, octopus balls, seaweed and choy sum) is not a bad choice either."}
{"text":"I only had the afternoon tea so the review is only based on the afternoon tea combs. This is your typical Chinese style Cafe and the food is ur typical Chinese Cafe dishes. It's a good place to come for if your in the area and want a Chinese style Cafe. Ordered the chicken wings as every table ordered them. It was pretty good and tasted as I expected. Nice, crisp and not dry. If your gonna order them, keep in mind they take quite some time. The only thing I was disappointed was my egg and corn beef sandwich. Lots of egg but where was the corn beef?! Lol"}
{"text":"Larger portions than expected so we did need a doggie bag especially for the gallon of hot and sour soup  We focused on seafood dishes so the eggplant and shrimp hotpot, and the shrimp and tofu dish were ordered  Food arrives quickly with hot tea  i am not sure as someone mentioned that it is Hong Kong style if that means lack of flavor then this is what they serve  It's quality ingredients but i did need to add salt and hot sauce to everything except the soup  Not a bad thing just that i expected more flavor  What I plan to have next time is the lobster special for 4.....that looked tasty as the table beside me chowed down   If that's the style of food then that's ok"}
{"text":"$20 tax and tip in for 3 people, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday lunch. Had to wait 10 mins for a table. Small waiting area. Party of 5 ordered: 23 malay soft shelled crab fried rice 37 fried rice noodle & seafood w/ XO sauce 44 shredded pork w/ preserved egg congee 51 dough fritter  Some of the lunch specials came with additional drinks. We got 2 HK milk teas.   The hot milk teas were dark, heavy and the grittiness was everywhere in my mouth. The dough fritter arrived pretty quickly and the congee soon after. The congee was enough for 6 bowls.  Fried rice noodle came after finishing congee. Wow. Spicy. Mostly noodle but has some fish, peppers and shrimp. Hot. 6 bowls. Fried rice came right after finishing the previous dish. Many small pieces of fried shift shelled crab added a savory subtle taste. Rice was dry  43 Lai wan style congee Many ingredients including shrimp   Busing could be better. After finishing and piling 3 dishes, they were finally taken away.  As we were eating, lineups were forming. Very busy."}
{"text":"My family usually goes to Perfect Chinese Restaurant for lobster but decided to give this place a try. We ordered the double lobster dinner for 4 which came with 2 lobsters, ginger and scallion flavour, half a fried chicken, sweet and sour pork, and bok choy. Since my sister is vegan she got herself an order of green beans with eggplant and mushroom and veggies. The staff were really acommodating when my sister requested that no oyster sauce or animal fat were used in the cooking of her dishes. The lobster was absolutely amazing. It was so flavourful and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The downside I thought was the fried chicken. For some reason I thought I would be getting KFC type chicken. Since they didn't bread the chicken before deep frying it the meat turned out really dry and even the skin was tough to eat. It was hard to swallow that chicken but overall it was a decent experience. I would only come back for the lobster though, the rest of the menu seemed really mediocre."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took us this long to find this spot that's 5 mins away from home. But I guess it's not easy when there are so many choices at this part of Highway 7.   The prices are very reasonable and you have all the usual Chinese family restaurant choices.   We ordered the cream corn soup (kids' favourite), eggplant and tofu hotpot, beef ribs, and fried veggies.   We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for the price. How can I get a baked rice with seafood or pork chop for under $6?  So I come here for lunch, they have tons of \"daily lunch specials\" under $6, and if you want to splurge you could find something under $7. But Baked Pork Chop, Chicken steak, seafood, meat sauce all for under $6.  When you order one of those baked options, you got two options for base: Rice+Spaghetti. You got three options for sauce: tomato (read ketchup), cream or black pepper.  The black pepper sauce often times is kinda too salty. And cause they \"bake\" it, it can sometimes burn on the top. Cause we're not taking real baked rice. We're talking some fried rice (yes, they give you fried rice), the meat on top, sauce on top. Throw it into the oven to burn it a bit. But it's still pretty good I gotta say."}
{"text":"In the big ocean of restaurants... this Ocean Seafood place is better than most.   WARNING: CASH only.  They have a funny sign in the front (like 5 years old) that states their credit card machine is not working. I think it never has but it doesn't take away from the experience.   Most of the workers speak Chinese and some English.  Don't ask to modify the meals.  Just order what you like.  They have a very big range of asian comfort foods.  My favourite and child friendly are the rice noodle dishes at are not spicy and the Minced beef and egg on rice.  The gravy is damn good.   Check them out."}
{"text":"My family and I received terrible service at this restaurant. We waited over an hour for one dish that did not even end up coming. The waitress lied to us and told us it was coming. But after waiting another 30 minutes on top of that they told us they never even put the order in for our dish. The server told us if we really wanted the dish we had to wait another 30 minutes. We left with no apology from the manager or discount. To sum up our dinner we had a bowl of white rice and soup. In my opinion, this place doesn't even deserve 1 star. WARNING don't go to this restaurant if you don't want your dinner ruined."}
{"text":"As other Chinese restaurants, Ocean Seafood Restaurant is always crowded and full of people ( include staffs run around). The service is quick and I like it. I came here with other friends and we have seated almost right away. The menu is full of pictures with help us to check the food out easier. If you order a combo 8 - 9 dishes, you will get soup for free, or else you can customize your soup ( egg drop or hot and sour). Of course, you will pay the extra. I recommend the crispy rice with oyster seafood sauce ( I don't remember the exact name). The rice is deep-fried to make is crispy and crunchy to eat with the special sauce on the side. The sauce base is oyster-sauce; shrimp and veggies on top. It's around $8 and you can share with 5 people. But prepare your mind if you don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese, you will have some trouble to order food or ask them any information about the food. Not all of them can communicate English well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and believe me there is nothing really good. I order a simple pineapple bun with butter. It wasn't warm and had to send it back. It will be last time here."}
{"text":"3.5 - had dinner here tonight for my father's birthday and overall it was a great experience. Tables can be booked in advance which I would recommend as the restaurant tends to get busy around the dinner hour. Our reservation for 6pm and we were seated immediately. The food and service was great. We ordered black bean clams, peking duck in two ways, noodles with beef and vegetables with two mushrooms. They offer an in house soup which is very flavorful. The prices are amazing for the food you receive. Is it the best of anything, no not really but for the prices and overall value are great. After the meal, they provided a red bean soup. The only downfall would be that the restaurant accepts only cash which for me was difficult as I am a card type person (credit/debit). Please note that there is no bank/atm around as well."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews, it is time to try it, so we family of seven went to this Restaurant last night.  I was surprised it only accepted cash and no discount for paying cash.  My son who was the host, ordered 8 dishes including Peking Duck with lettuce wrap as second course.  Lobster, beef tenderloin and pork chop with Peking sauce.    Overall, I would say it is not bad,  Service was quite good.  We were surprised that was no free dessert though, consider it is a formal Chinese dinner."}
{"text":"My go-to place for decent Hong Kong style food, great service and price. Couldn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Decent prices, lots of variety, food quality is dependable, consistent, but nothing mind-blowing.  There's really not that much else to say. This is almost like a run-of-the mill Chinese restaurant, just with slightly above-average execution. Older Chinese folks (like my parents) love this place for whatever reason, and it ends up being crowded during the weekend dinners. I'll take this place over Congee Queen, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"The place was super busy on a Friday afternoon. However, it was on Easter Friday so many people got the day off. Had to take wait about 10 minutes to get a table.    The prices are rock bottom here.  For example, beef with udon noodles + 2 eggs with buttered bread + milk tea was $5.49 I believe. The milk tea was chilled ice cold and very silky.   Also had the scrambled egg sandwich. It was good but when compared to other HK style cafe I think New City has the best as I find the egg is thicker and fluffier.   Everything tasted very good here. Service was pretty good considering how busy they were. You are not gonna get mind blowing amazing food here but if you want cheap HK style comfort food then this is a great place to visit.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"For price point for an HK style breakfast - this place offers good value for money.   It has plenty of seating and lots of large tables for largish families.   Service is perfunctory and pleasant.   Pricing well you get good value for your dollars.   But food wise - it's ok and compared to the other places in the area - I honestly can't say I am wowed by this place. The drinks are kind of ok - but standard.   Their satay beef macaroni is ok - but I found it a bit overly watery and bland.   Overall ok, but I feel that there are better places in the area that offer a better version of an HK cafe style breakfast."}
{"text":"Typical Hong Kong style cafe. Food comes fast and affordable. It's hot and doesn't feel like it's microwaved. Breakfast deals are pretty good. Parking can be a bit hard but go to the back and there's parking underground."}
{"text":"Okay, the first question I would have asked after eating here is: How the hell do they stay in business?  Our table of five had one of the special combos, which included soup of the day, abalone, peking duck, and three other items...for $99!!!!! Normally in other restaurants six pieces of abalone and peking duck alone would easily eclipse $100. This place reminds me of Hai Tang Cafe, which by the way are both under the same owner...and I'm still perplexed on how both restaurants can charge prices this ridiculously cheap.  Even though the prices are cheap, the quality is actually quite decent as well. The soup was a little bit on the MSG side, but the other items were very good, especially for the price we had to pay. The abalone actually came with abalone sauce, and large shittake mushrooms as well.  Be warned though: No dessert here. However for $99, what do you honestly expect?"}
{"text":"Cheap cheap cheap quality food!!  For $20 you can get about 3 dishes, and free soup and white rice!!  I wish we lived closer so we could eat here more often."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times throughout the past 10 years. It's just got worse. We ordered 5 course dinner and it was not even close to what we had before. The steamed fish is definitely not a fresh fish, the fish was mushy and they overcooked it. The bass fillet was just didn't taste right. Out of the 5 dishes, there were only 2 dishes that we can considered enjoying them. Either the chef changed or the quality of food itself. Is not there anymore. It's just one of the worse I ever had."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 20ish times and I always forget to write my review  I've been here since the place opened like maybe a year half ago and in the beginning this was the place to be for cheap delicious and generous portion of HK food....their lunch specials were reasonable priced and included a hot drink of ur choice, but as the months went by I found the quality to dwindled down where i had several upset stomach after eating their food.....I also found that after eating the food I was soooo thirsty and it was prolly due to too much msg used, their prices have also gone up a bit like maybe 50 cents more  I rarely come to this place anymore and I will probably keep it that way There are much better places to goto that are within minutes away from this place like k&k cafe and congee queen"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food here. It's not the best Chinese food I have ever had, but for the price its pretty good value. We ordered the bbq garlic short ribs, xo sauce with tofu, shrimp and broccoli, steamed fish and half of a steamed chicken. Everything was seasoned correctly and not overly salty or loaded with msg. The shrimp we ordered was pretty big and it was so succulent, I will come back just for this dish. The steamed fish was steamed perfectly and it was so delicious.   One thing I must point out, when we were deciding what we wanted for dinner a server came over and poured our empty tea cups with tea. It's not like he had nothing better to do because the restaurant was full, so that was nice."}
{"text":"I would have given it 3 stars since its truly nothing special but the decent/fair prices makes it slightly better minus the service here.   My parents heard this place was decent. Either from friends, newspaper or ad on tv. The prices were decent as we ordered a 4 course meal with lobster for $58 ish dollars. We end up adding another dish. When we walked in I believe it was in the middle of \"HK afternoon tea\" so it didn't look very dinner like. The tea was in plastic cups versus the ceramic ones I'm used to. We were given the afternoon tea menu and my parents asked for the dinner menu. Yes we were eating dinner around 4:30pm as we all had an early day and exhausted. We decided on the ginger and onion lobster course dinner. It was decent. Came with sweet and sour pork chops, Bak Choy with garlic, and chicken. The standard is fried, but if you add $3 you can get the steamed chicken. The dishes were decently sized and good value.   Service was mediocre. Typical Chinese restaurant service. However, during dinner the server was trying to swap our plates. She somehow knocks my dads tea all over his lap. Poor dad lol. She was sorry but no manager came by to apologize, no offer to take any discount off (again, typical Chinese restaurant). My dad was pretty upset and luckily we were almost done so we left abruptly.   Will I be back? Probably not.   Ps. I also didn't like that the bill says we must tip minimum 10%. Annoying!"}
{"text":"Wondering why are they be so busy, yes, I am not a regular customer, but I am still a customer, the waitress giving me a really bad attitude like I am wasting her time when I was asking questions, hey I am not working there, is normal to ask some basic questions n is your job to answer. Mean while she was really Nice to the next regular customer table. You will never get new regular customer, at least not me.  The food was super salty, if you have high blood pressure, beware of that.  All in all don't waste your time to go there, period!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night, understand its busy and we waited for a table of 4.  We waited a good 15 20 mins, a group of 5 came and there was a round table leaving, I understood they would want to sit a larger group 1st and I saw a booth clearing, another group of 5 came and they gave the booth (sits 4) to the group of 5 and added a small table and totally ignored our group... this is not how you do business... will never come again..."}
{"text":"We've been here for dinner, lunch and take out. the food is pretty decent and prices are cheap compared to other Hk style cafe restaurants. They have very fast service too which is good if u go and want a quick bite."}
{"text":"this review is for the corn beef and egg sandwich... seriously put more corn beef i didn't order an egg sandwich yo and what's with the soggy bread?? i specifically asked for it toasted!!!! I'm very disappointed at this sandwich and i really think as a hong kong style cha chan teng, they should make better sandwiches than this LOL"}
{"text":"The food here incredibly cheap, in the $5-$7 range, which does not at all reflect on the quality of food in a negative way. It's tasty, not greasy and the portions are big. What more could you want to get the necessary calories and enjoy your meal? Did I mention their $4 lunch specials? Yeah, their prices are that good. You owe them a visit if you're in the area.

{"text":"I love coming to place to eat their tomato baked chicken spaghetti! Other main dishes are okay as well. But my go to is the spaghetti. also during breakfast and lunch it comes with a free drink on the side, hot/cold(+$1)."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance scare you off, it is very reasonably priced for the foods offered be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The portion sizes are also very generous.   One caveat is that their clientele is primarily catered for the Chinese and may have a \"lost in translation\" if asking them. Luckily their menus have the English equivalent mind you a few spelling mistakes here and there... Club sandwrich, or the ever yummy beef Santee udon in soup.   Be adventurous and have fun with the menu."}
{"text":"Here's the thing...If you're looking for good service and food presentation, don't go to a Hong Kong style restaurant. But if you're looking for a cheap meal, this is the place for you. Most of its lunch menu is under $10 and the portions are quite large. If you go on a weekday between 2:30-5:00p and spend more than $15 before taxes, you'll also get a free pineapple bun or French toast. Not too bad of a deal I'd say!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice, food is good, price is reasonable, one of good place for chinese food"}
{"text":"Very good Western food prepared by Cantonese people.  It is similar to other Cantonese Cafes in Richmond Hill, but the price and quality is a lot better than what you will find along the Hwy 7 and 16th area.  I absolutely love the lunch specials at this place."}
{"text":"I have been back to Ocean Seafood Restaurant a few more times since my last review..  lunch, afternoon tea and dinner  Though the price here is cheap, the quality matches that too.  My last dinner experience was just horrible. Both the dishes were beyond bad! The fish fillet has this thick soggy batter and the snow pea shoots was old and rough.  Meh... not going to be back for awhile....."}
{"text":"My go to place for lunch and high tea!!! Although they are always busy during lunch hours, service is very quick. Food is very good for the price you're paying for. I would usually end up paying less than 10 dollars after tax and tips for my meal which includes a hot drink as well. As a bonus, the portions on their lunch menu are so big that I can bring a third of it home for later.   After 2:30, you get the option of ordering from their high tea menu (also comes with drink). I would highly recommend their 8 piece chicken wings as it's perfectly seasoned and fried. On weekdays, you also get a free French toast dish if your order is greater than $15.  Overall, this is a great place to go for a quick and cheap lunch or snack."}
{"text":"We ordered the dinner for four and a 5lb lobster.  First up was a very light soup to get the appetite going. Clear broth with few veggies and sugar cane.  Next was the Peking duck. The duck was plentiful and fresh. Could have used more onions and carrots but other than that it was great.  Then the 5 lb lobster chopped and deep fried in a salt and pepper coating.  Delicious!!!! Yellow chicken with ginger onion, veggies and mushrooms, fried rice with the lobster sauce, stir fried duck with lettuce wraps..... Can't go wrong.  Finished off with a warm taro dessert.  Service was great.  The staff was quick to refill the tea, remove empty dishes, and serve the soup and food."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Me and my friend ordered their all day combo.  Beef satay noodle in soup, corn beef & egg sandwich.  Both not very appealing in appearance and just fair in taste."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go inside Ocean Seafood, because it looked so nice from the outside.  We thought it was expensive.  But of course, I checked Yelp and it told me this place was not expensive.  Surely, it costed us $24 only for 3 dishes, taxes inclusive.  Sweet!!  We ordered a Pickled Vegetable Stir Fried Rice ($6), a Fish Fillet with Vegetable ($8) and a Beef with Asparagus ($7.50).  The stir fried rice tasted bland.  Both the fish fillet and the beef dishes tasted decent/average/okay .  The ingredients of all 3 dishes were average fresh, especially the fish (it was not rotten though).  But at this price level, my expectation was adjusted correspondingly.     Food came very fast.  Services was effective.  Food only, 3 stars.  Overall value, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Love the stirred fried lobsters with green onion & ginger. Great services and friendly servers."}
{"text":"If you want good price and more than average servings, this is the place to go. It's been our favorite sit down dinner and take out place too. Be prepared to stand in line during peak time dinner or lunch hours. Don't know what to order for a group of 6 people?  There are set meals for 6 like double lobsters, beef dish, prawns, fish with corn, veggie dish with mushrooms, steam and yellow chicken. Its $72.99.  We added an order of Cantonese chow mein. All that food for 6!  Love them!"}
{"text":"4 and half stars...  this place is pretty bomb... prices are quite good.  breakfast and lunch here is a must if you want good HK food.   They have a franchise and several locations... all busy and all with cheap good eats.  although the milk tea is a hit and miss sometimes.. sometimes diarrea sometimes not.. u take the risk.. no pain no gain my friends."}
{"text":"Ocean Seafood Restaurant is one of those places that I go so much but I always forget to write a review. Their biggest draw is definitely the amazing prices. I always marvel at how cheap my bill turn out to be- it is cheaper than getting a meal at Tim Horton's!   For breakfast/lunch, I enjoy their egg and spam sandwich, which comes with a lot of egg and spam. However, the drinks are pretty disappointing- everything seemed watered down.  For dinner, I always appreciate the complimentary Chinese soup to start. And if you order take out, they give you soup and rice for free if you order 2 dishes or more. It's perhaps not the greatest place for Cantonese style food in the city, but the value is awesome!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a family get together in the GTA, we usually end up coming here when we want Chinese food. Really good Cantonese-style food for reasonably low prices. For a party of 9 people, we were able to leave super full (with a bit of take-out leftovers!) for ~$160.  Their seafood and meat dishes are done well with decent portions. All the flavours and seasonings are spot on, only downside is most of their dishes are quite oily. My personal favourites are: -Peking duck with the leftover duck meat in a savoury black bean sauce -Bok Choy & king oyster mushroom dish -fried fish with egg drop corn sauce"}
{"text":"The service was good; price was right; and the food was yum.  Ordered a baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce as well as the baked Ham and chicken on rice with white sauce.  Both were very comparable to out usual Kenny's stomping ground.  To our surprise, we were offered a complimentary French toast which was quite yummy.  The cold milk tea was just right and the cold lemon ice tea wasn't the best I've had but it wasn't bad either.  All that for $14.42 made it a bargain of a quality meal.  We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Well, this place is busy to the max around dinner hours from 5:30-7, it slows down a bit right after 7:30. Reserve for quicker access to seat.   I went with a friend and ordered the Peking duck (35$), salt and pepper shrimp (7.99$) and clams in black bean sauce (7.99$). Everything was pretty decent and average tasting. The prices were also decent.  However, there must have been something off as I had a major stomach ache and pains for the whole night after that meal.  Overall, for what it costs, it was alright. Would I go back? Maybe, to try the lunch special... Or if I'm around the area. :)"}
