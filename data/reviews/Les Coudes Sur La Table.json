{"text":"Had lunch here after deciding to walk from our hotel (1.5 miles), braving the wind and snow.  I immediately decided to warm up with the fish soup (it worked) and had the braised venison over noodles.  Yummy!  Just perfect!!  The staff could not have been more attentive and friendly.    We took a cab back :-)"}
{"text":"Excellente expérience dans ce restaurant délicieux. Personnel adorable et a l'écoute! Je recommande :)"}
{"text":"On me l'avait fortement recommandé, j'ia finalement fait le grand saut. Le service est excellent, bons plats, goûteux, abordables  J'ai adoré mon risotto au safran avec (de mémoire) poivrons rouges, parmesan et mascarpone.  Au dessert, un brownie au chocolat noir, sorbet coco.   Franchement, j'y retourne"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this resto by walking by and wss intrigued by what I saw. What a find! This is a terrific little place. Nice setting, with warm and airy feel. With its high ceilings and comfortable layout the environment is a 'cosy business'. They serve their meals with Fresh ingredients with great service. My friend had the salmon tartare and i had the 'fish of the day' both were well presented and were delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why this place doesn't get more credits or review. I believe we came on a weekend night, and it was empty. We were 6 girls and all of us were satisfied.    I'm a difficult and picky eater. The price point does not bother me, whether if its high or low. what bothers me is that IF your bill costs you an arm and a leg, I hope you come out surprised and satisfied.   Les Coudes Sur La Table did not disappoint me a tiny bit. 5 STARS FOR ME- and i would come back."}
