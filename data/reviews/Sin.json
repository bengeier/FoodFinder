{"text":"This place sucks!!., beware they need your $$!  - went with a friend for lunch, got a order of the awful oysters... Not fresh... Even our martini's had old fruit!!.  We asked for the bill, I paid \"cash\" the waitress was no where to be seen.. \"Like when we walked in\". As we were getting into our car to leave, we saw the staff chasing our car with a interac machine!!!!.... Everyone was staring at us like we were criminals!!  - I got out And asked what the problem was, she told me I need to pay my bill... I asked the rocket scientist if she checked the bill folder... It had cash in it!!!  - I was so outraged I went to speak to the manager, I explained that service was horrific, the chase was ridiculous an the food was not just sub- par it was SHIT.  - so his guy that probably gets 45k a year just stared at me like deer in headlights... My advice, stay away there are plenty of other places in the area that appreciate the business !  - to eat here is a sin!!-"}
{"text":"Went there for a work party and it was ok but nothing special.  I pass by the place many time and never seem to be full so I was glad to finally have a reason to try the place once we had to meet there with the co worker.   The service was ok and we had a pretty big group but they did try their best to serve us all at once.  Girl at the bar wear close to nothing so I guess the male in our parties like it but most of the female didn't (older folks lol)  Food was good but VERY salty and I am a salt lover so if I find it salty then it must be. We had some I believe was Jack Daniel chicken bite and those were very tasty. Small portion and the price is a bit high for what you get.  I might try it again for drink if I am in the area but I wont be going out of my way for that."}
{"text":"Jack Daniels burger well done. Didn't even get me drunk. Attractive staff an decent menu."}
{"text":"c'est ma troisieme visite a ce restaurant. les deux premiere fois il y avait de la musique live et l'endroit etait plein. cette fois ci c'est different. jeudi soir, 18h le restaurant a une 12 de clients sur la terrasse et meme chose au bar. le jeudi du moins il y a un special sur la biere et aussi une promo sur le vin pour les dames. c'est bien parti avec de bons prix sur l' alcool. nous nous assis sur la terrasse pour l'apero. tout baigne sauf que la vue est sur le stationnement et l'autoroute 13. Au moins nous sommes dehors. Pour débuter nous avons partager un brie fondant a l'erable et noix.  Difficile a raté mais ils ont réussi. Un cuisinier a eu la brillante idee de mettre au four le brie en le couchant sur un lit de romarin. Résultat, en fondant le fromage rendu mou s'incruste dans le romarin. tres desagreable et une bonne partie du frogage est perdu. Mon invitée a choisi le tartare de saumon qui selon la serveuse était une de leurs spécialitées. Elle l' a trouvé terne et sans gout. Pour ma part j' ai choisi un burger avec toutes les garnitures. Rien a écrire a sa mère. Les frites par contre etaient excellentes. Le service est amical et professionel. Les prix des verres de vin sont élevés mais la nourriture l' est encore plus. J, ai été décu et je n'y retournerai plus."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Went a couple of times to watch the Habs game.The food is ok but nothing special service was also slow."}
{"text":"I was scheduled to leave for Toronto by noon but that did not happen and it was already 5pm so not wanting to be stuck in traffic we decided to have dinner at Sin. We were early and the place was empty. I have been before here and I would have given a 4 star then pre-yelp days. But tonite it was just OK!! The first thing I noticed when I walked in was cleavage and big cleavage behind the bar. 3 stars right there and the rest was down hill.....lol...just joking but the cleavage was not a joke. Our waiter was a little cheesy(Gabrielle) I liked him but the girls didn't like his corny jokes and how good the best calamari in town were at Sin. Well the portion was very small and not even close to being the best Calamari in town!! We let him know. My main meal was the Chicken burger w/fries. We asked if they seasoned the fries and he told us no!! But mine were so salty which was a shame as the fries were pretty good. My Burger on the other hand was hard and dry at time and OK at other bites. So a disappointing evening over all except for you know what!!! Keep your eyes for the blondie behind the bar wear very little clothes!! Next time I will just go for drinks...."}
