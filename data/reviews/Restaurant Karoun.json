{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE:  waited 15 minutes for menus, only got them after I hunted down someone and asked.  
After getting my Corona without a lime or lemon I asked for one... never got it.  
They usually give olives at the table while you wait for your food, didn't get it, then asked for it, still never got it.  
Never got water, I had to walk to the bar with 4 empty glasses and asked the owner's wife for water. 
Waiter never asked do you need anything, is everything ok, he would come, drop off a bag of pita and bolt off  seemingly almost hoping we wouldn't ask for something. 
Waited forever to get my bill, went to the cash to pay and the young girl behind the counter texted for 2 minutes before acknowledging me.
Also, I know this sounds terrible, but I saw it: One table left a 1/2 craft of house wine on the table, I saw the busyboy and guy behind the bar talk and then recycled it for the next person to order a house wine.
Good: Food, if you get it hot, they also gave out the food to the table at 5 minute intervals, so some people waited before the others got food, after a while we told them eat as their food was getting cold...  Problem with this place is they think they give good service, but they are clueless."}
{"text":"Good food, ungly decor. Good service but staff never smiling. Best Arab and Arméniennes choice in area"}
{"text":"I am lebanese and everytime I come to Canada I pass by Karoun to a full mezza dinner... This past saturday I came with my husband and another couple for dinner there .. and we asked for Baklava for desert where the owner came to us and said U guys need to leave soon (there is baklava but we have a reservation for your table, we cannot serve u ).. 

If there is a reservation, why did u seat us .. just say we r full, we cannot accomodate u ! Don't seat us and make us order food and rush us so quick not to get desert... 

The food is good here .. but i am very disappointed by the Manager and the service.. Especially i was the only one Lebanese among my friends .."}
{"text":"Really pretty much perfect. My boyfriend had the filet mignon shish and I had the chicken taouk and both were superb. Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. Accompaniments were fresh and tasty. Hummus fresh and balanced, everything so good. Even on a very busy Saturday night, service was fast and hardly any wait for our food. Highly recommended on every level. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Laval!"}
{"text":"If I only lived closer to Karoun.....I would be there EVERY DAY
This restaurant has THE most authentic Armenian/Syrian/Lebanese food out of anywhere in North America.  
I often make the 5 hour drive just to eat here, it's that good.
I recommend Karoun to everyone I know that is looking for amazing food."}
{"text":"I love this place they have each varieties in the menu like every Lebanese restaurant , the food is amazing but sometimes it's a saltier than usual but we can't deny how good their mezzes are and their fattouch and the barbecues"}
{"text":"Ordered food.   Took over 1hr.    Food was cold. Price was ok and so was the food......"}
{"text":"After having terrible, terrible Greek food in Toronto, I really wanted something Mediterranean AND great.  We found this place on a \"cheap eats\" site.  Karoun's advertises itself as Armenian and Lebanese food, and both are great by me.  Once in the restaurant, it seemed to me to be more Lebanese than Armenian, not that it matters.

The room is big and the menus are colorful items describing what is on offered.  My colleague ordered a plate with beef/lamb sticks (I know it has a proper name, I just don't know what it is).  I am not a vegetarian, but the vegetable combo looked great:  hummus, falafels, some vegetables.

We both left satisfied and full.  The falafels came smothered in tahini, which made me nervous.  My fears were unfounded.  The whole plate worked great together.  The hummus was smooth and full of flavor.  Karoun's used a good olive oil, too.  The flavors were intense, yet of a piece:  no wrong notes here.

The staff is efficient.  They initially came off cold, but I think our enthusiasm for the food warmed them up (after nearly a week on the road eating poorly, or seeking the refuge of the consistency of Tim Horton's, we needed a culinary success story).  

We finished up with a Turkish style coffee that helped make sure everything inside settled in nicely.

Restaurant Karoun is a gem, and a welcome relief to this weary road warrior!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute favorite of our family. They serve homemade food that has authentic flavor and for great value. Better make a reservation, because you might have to wait...although they took my party of 7 pretty last minute and delivered an amazing meal. Nobody was left hungry and we all cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this middle-eastern restaurant and was pleasant to see they were not wrong.

We started with basterma , which is very tasty (but not spicy).

We ordered the Makhlouta plate, chicken and beef shawarma with rice and salad.
The portions are huge, a bit of hummus and garlic sauce to top it off.

Another dish is the combo plate , shish kebab, chicken cubes and beef kefta.
The latter had the perfect seasoning for me, just like my mom's. I changed the rice for fries and they were delicious and freshly made.

I loved the fact the salad was not an a afterthought , but a freshly made fatouche (minus the pita bread).

The decor is nice with high ceilings and its on par with prices for the run of the mill shawarma joints around the city."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food I ever had. The place is warm and inviting, the decor is charming and somewhat tropical, nice terrace. The staff was helpful, friendly and respectful. The Food arrived fast and warm and extremely fresh. It was absolutely delicious, cooked perfectly and the meat was so tender it almost broke apart in my mouth. I did not need to add any salt or have extra sauce for my meat which is rare for me. The food was perfect just the way it arrived. My bf and I took the meat platter that came with 3 fillet mignon, 3 chicken brochettes and 3 kafta or however you spell it anyway it was so good we finished everything. The taboule was good but not as good as mom's of course but hers is tough to beat. The  Karoun salad was fresh, simple but delicious and each veggie was perfectly coated with dressing. The ambiance was great and the energy was light and very welcoming. Plates vary in prices, you also have sandwiches which are cheaper. Plates are about 9-14$ approx. Our platter was 28$ and so worth it. This place will definitely be a tough one to beat ! My new go to place for delicious Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Great fast Lebanese style food. The portions have gotten smaller over the years and the prices have gone up however we still enjoy the food. 
The renovations unfortunately take away from the original familly owned feeling and they are clearly understaffed at all times. One waitress for the entire restaurant which has around 20 tables of 4-6 seats."}
{"text":"we ordered trio mix, vegetarian combo, tabouleh and hummus. all the food was delicious. the kofta in the trio mix was a bit hard but it was only this time. we have been here several times before and the food was always great. i love the atmosphere of the place too. will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Karoun in my many years but after taking a random takeout here I plan to remedy this as this place is the best middle eastern takeout food I can get near work.

I went with their shishtaouk/shawarma platter and it was filled with meat. The meat was very good. The portion of rice and salad was very big as well. I compared my experience similar to what I get to Amir but the quality of the food a huge step than what I'd get there.

The price-tag was very reasonable.

I should come back more often."}
{"text":"When I'm in Montreal, I have to stop at Karoun. I do enjoy sitting down for a meal, everything is very authentic and the portions are great. 

My go-to is a Soujouk Sandwich. Fucking amazing! Make sure you get it in a Baguette with Garlic, Pickles and Toasted. It's insane!"}
{"text":"Compared to the many Southern California Armenian/Middle Eastern restaurants, this place holds it's own.
Food was very good.
Plenty of parking.
Nice and clean building/restaurant.
Prices very reasonable.
We were a party of 12 And they were able to feed us all at the same time. Nice job.
Would come back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Ca doit faire plus de 15 ans que je pars de chez moi à Verdun pour venir manger ici. C'est bon à se point la. Je prends toujours ma merveilleuse fattouch et le sandwich à la cervelle. Sûrement dans mon top 5 resto dans le grand Montréal."}
{"text":"Good food with good flavour, fresh, cooked as it should be, one of the good Lebanese/Armenian food restaurant. Service was fast even though we had to wait 25min for our reserved table. We had a big selection of appetizers as well as mixed grilles. Price was affordable. Ambience us casual. My only negative is that stuff need to be more smiling . I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Good authentic food. Horrible service. Never smile. Owner is arrogant. If service is important to you, as it it to us so our food goes down better, go elsewhere. Too bad because the food is tasty and fresh."}
