{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant. The main cuisine focus seems to be Taiwanese style bento boxes, Bubble tea and some light snacks. While the owners are not from Taiwan, their chef is. Their main clients are students and office workers as it is at a very convenient for University students and Office worker to come by for lunch.  Decide to try the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken on Rice and Fish cake on my way home from work. The flavours are close but not quite there yet. The popcorn chicken can be a little bit more crispy. The chef should cut the fish cake into strips instead of serving them in a large circle shape - it would make it easier to dip the sauces that they provide for the fish cake.  Overall, it's not a bad place to try if you are looking for something that is quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Quick fast food place! The food is delecious and filling. It is recommended if you are in a rush as the food is ready real quick!!  Service 8/10 Food 9/10  Price - very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for the price, especially since there are no Taiwanese cafes nearby. My guess is that the closest would be in Chinatown or any areas close to. (maybe past Bay and Dundas heading west?) I haven't tried any of their western food other than the french fries, but they sound pretty good.  In General, this is a good place for a quick bite, especially if you're a student on if you work in the area. The staff doesn't speak English too well unfortunately; whenever I've asked questions about the food they usually don't understand me. Otherwise, I don't mind coming here for some Taiwanese popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Small run Taiwanese restaurant. Fair value bento food, good for student comes often since it has vegetable, egg and meat in a meal. I ordered a salt baked chicken and full already. Lol, can't eat too much."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a quick and cheap meal!  Good selection of various traditional Taiwanese options (popcorn chicken, Taiwanese sausage, etc) and all served in a bento box for easy on-the-go meals!  I always come here if I need to have a quick lunch!  Contrary to other reviewers, I think the portions are decent considering they give you a lot of side dishes and I end up being quite full at the end of my meal!  Very small place (so it gets packed at dinner time), and friendly staff.  I recommend if you need a quick fix for your empty belly!"}
{"text":"can't tell you how happy i am to find Taiwanese food near work! quite tasty and quick. combo with a bubble tea for $11.xx"}
{"text":"LOVE this place  ! I come there with my friends very often. Most of their food are really yummy. The bento box is pretty good for the price. I'll recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with seating for 16 or so.  Place can fill up pretty fast depending on the time of day so if you're bringing a large group (6 or more) there may be some difficulty finding seats.  Having gone twice so far, the dishes seem pretty hit-or-miss. Chicken cutlet was great, with a somewhat crispy skin and tender meat  However, the popcorn chicken was not as enjoyable since the skin was pretty chewy. Though to be fair we did walk over to college park out in below-zero weather so maybe that might have been the cause.  Price is alright: $9 for a bento box, with 10% discount for students that pay cash-only. Portions are not too big but not too small either. Would be nice if they had some options other than just white rice though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars*. Decent very casual sit in or takeout place with authentic Taiwanese tasting food, with dishes under $10. A good grab and go or for a quick bite. The beans are a bit salty but the meats are good (got the bentos with chicken and pork). Not much I can say about the place as a restaurant, as its not really a bustling restaurant, more like a \"pay first then get your food to sit down or to take out\" operation, like a food court. Everything efficient."}
{"text":"Same owners as the previous Sweet Peppers place, and they've kinda gone to their Asian roots with home style like Taiwanese bento boxes.  They've kept the Sweet Pepper's menu, though only as a side note.  It's there, you just have to look for it.  Considering there's not another Taiwanese option nearby, it's good they're trying for another option, as I don't think their previous place could have been sustainable (Italian Sandwiches just aren't their forte).  The food is ok, but the portions are on the smallish side.  And as others have mentioned.. the food comes up a bit bland, and I'd say much more home style in terms of flavour (could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for.)"}
{"text":"I grew up in Taiwan and have always loved the food. The food at this place wasn't bad and for a fairly good value.   However I had a horrible experience when i discovered their combo+bubble tea for 1.99 is not really bubble tea.  I've called back and asked them the man who answered the phone claim bubble tea is without the tapioca...so i thought but that just makes it a milk tea... so i went on to ask him what tea with milk is called he said bubble tea. Why would you call something bubble if theirs nothing circular in the drink. He didnt take that too kindly and gave me a horrible attitude.   The food is good but be advised of the horrible service."}
{"text":"This little family-run Taiwanese spot is definitely a hidden gem in downtown Toronto. They have everything, from popcorn chicken to salted chicken to Taiwanese sausages to even bubble tea!!!! And everything is super delicious--and cheap! I'm usually able to get a full meal for less than $10 here, usually even less than $8! If you crave authentic Taiwanese cuisine for a low price, you absolutely CANNOT miss this spot."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is a small fast food bento box place. I walked in one day and Ordered a pop-corn chicken on rice. Portion is medium size, the appetizers were cold. But food came out fast. Since I live nearby, I might visit again if I'm craving it."}
{"text":"Lots of intl students come thru here I feel  Food is home style, a bento lunch after tax is around $10, portion size is a little on the small end but it's good if you don't wanna be too full  You get rice, meat, an egg, broccoli pieces, and tofu, there's also sides you can get and bubble tea, but I never tried it here  Also can you guys put more vegetables? Would be nice thanks!"}
{"text":"I love all their food and have been trying every single one of them in the past few days. I wish that they could move to Yonge and Bloor....so that I don't need to walk that far."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for any place that is quiet, comfortable and has WiFi. This place is no exception.  I ordered Taiwanese Style Minced Pork On Rice which is frankly one of my favorite dishes of all time. I try to order it whenever I can so the bar is set pretty high. The Yummy Zine version was far from the best but for $7.45 it was fair. It's rare to find decent Taiwanese food in downtown core so I'll take what I can get.   The service was good. I was greeted warmly. The male cashier who took my order reminds me so much of the typical Northeastern Chinese guy (not sure if that's where he's actually from) who is loyal, open, and honest, it made me feel a tad nostalgic.   Elevator pitch: Pacific Mall quality Taiwanese foods that come in lunch boxes and are swiftly prepared."}
{"text":"This is a great taiwanese restaurant in the heart of downtown.   It is a little bit off to the side of Bay street.   There is a wide selection of taiwanese food.   The most typical one would be the minced pork on rice.   You will find this dish everywhere in Taiwan.   However, every time I come here, I get the three cup chicken on rice.   The chicken is very soft and easy to bite.   The meat is tender and soft.  You order at the counter and then they'll bring it out on a tray.   The clientele is mainly chinese students and it shows.  Food is brought out quickly so they probably made it in the morning or overnight.  Still one of my favourite Taiwanese places in downtown.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"Despite being conveniently located on Bay St. and having affordable lunch prices, I always end up wishing I didn't eat here after taking out their lunch boxes.   Yet, I still keep coming back for more. I must admit it, Taiwanese food is a bit of an Achilles' heel for me. It is what I grew up eating and sometimes I miss it so much that I am forced to resort to this restaurant.   Just putting out there, their food is not AUTHENTIC Taiwanese food. The sour MSG aftertaste completely kills the food for me. Their food is also way too greasy and the sauce is mixed weirdly. It all tastes really artificial.   Do not recommend this place, but what can you do when there is no edible Taiwanese food in town. Beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"Thank gosh there is a Taiwanese restaurant in the downtown core. Lunch boxes are less than $10 I think and it comes with rice, protein (they skimp out on this), egg and seaweed salad and tastes good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Yummy Zone this week.   Our take:   the Yummy Zone it is not.   I ordered a chicken fillet that had white and dark meat portions somehow \"glued\" together, with some kind of \"jelly\" type substance covering the seams between the white and dark portions.   Simply put, it was yucky.   My wife's selection had some rather tough beef.   The rice wasn't too bad, although it was rather sticky.   My wife said the tofu was good.   But I cannot get off the one-star rating due to the amalgamated chicken fillets.   Honestly, the chicken fillets at fast food restaurants were more appetizing than these.   The tea selection is good--got to give them that.   If the Yummy Zone can improve the quality of its entrees, it wouldn't be a bad place to eat."}
