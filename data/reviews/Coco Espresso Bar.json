{"text":"Coco has become my go-to spot in Yorkville, whether it be for their delicious tiramisu or the hot chocolate. Drinking a macchiato there, while listening to their italian radio takes you back to Italy. The service is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The espresso here is the real deal: rich, flavorful, and pulled perfectly. Staff was very friendly and helpful, and the dessert section reminded me of my time spent studying abroad in Italy. Come check this place out when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Over priced coffee bar - not high quality. Not enough space during winter. The previous coffee place was much better."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to Coco Espresso Bar! The manager (maybe the owner) was very friendly and funny. To top it off the coffee was strong and well made. I'll be back!"}
