{"text":"This bakery is the real 'European Bakery' deal. Two special order cakes later, I am so, so, so pleased with the quality, service, and most especially the prices! 

They have so many of the best amazing European specialty cake choices: Dobosh Torte, Napolitana, Tiramisu, Peach Mousse, et al. I need another entire lifetime to get through the entire menu in this place. I have yet to try their specialty coffee drinks, sandwiches, and individual pastries. 

If you arrive early enough in the day, you will find a wall of fresh, warm breads, rolls, and baguettes. And then there are the individual pastries under glass...omg. They look and smell amazing! 

This place is like the best kept secret in the West Valley so don't tell anyone...

I too was curious about their background so I asked the patriarch. They in fact are the second owners, having purchased the bakery from the first owner in the past. The current owners kept the recipes and added thier own as well. 

The service is always 'European' style. The ladies who run the front-end are sweet enough to get you in and out quickly. They are also in school while working full-time for the family business and this is something I admire.

**It's too bad other YELPrs are such idiots. If Chrissy T. would have actually ASKED the owners of the bakery what language they spoke, she would have quickly realized that they are NOT Romanian."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time trying this place and my third time with terrible service. I kept trying to give it a chance because the pastries are pretty good and I live close but the people there are just flat out rude. The lady behind the counter and the man ringing me up were really snippy and aggressive to the woman in front of me the last time I went, then when I went to pay, they were very abrupt and just flat out mean. The woman actually rolled her eyes when I took longer than 2 seconds to pick out one of their pasteries. The macarons are terrible by the way. Overall, the pastries are not worth the crap service. Save yourself the time of paying some one to yell at you for giving them money. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing sandwich when we met my brother-in-law for lunch! I had the bruschetta and I wasn't super hungry as we had breakfast just a couple hours prior. However, I couldn't stop eating this sandwich! The man working the counter was friendly and appreciative. He sliced all ingredients, including meats, as you order so it was very fresh. The desserts looked wonderful. However after eating the whole sandwich, there was no way I could even try dessert and we were going to be out and about too long to take any to go.

I will definitely return when I'm back in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Delicious deli meats and sandwiches very delicious pastries!! You know they're good when people are lined up for their cake ordering for their sandwiches and for that bakery stuff"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a bakery.  I called many places to have a specialized cake made for my husband's retirement party that could feed 40-50 people.  I was so disheartened when all I could come up with was specialty bakeries quoting me $175.00 and higher, for a cake! I understand there is overhead and paying cake decorators but I cannot pay that high amount for a cake. This was a sheet cake, not a wedding cake i ordered.

I stumbled upon European Bakery and low and behold they made my cake to order for $66.00.
This cake was so moist and the mouse was fantastic! They worked with me on the graphics and the daughters of the owners were so accommodating.  The flavor I got was called Rigoletta, AMAZING!!  I was so impressed with this family owned bakery and I will defiantly be back and so will my guest.  Thank you European Bakery for a wonderful cake to top off my event."}
{"text":"I order birthday Cake Name of flyovers is Cappuccino Mousse and top of it some Macaroons and it's taste horrible. 
Cake was very soggy and I was so disappointed about that. 
When I called for cake order that lady said we will not at all disappoint you and when I got cake  all my plan flops"}
{"text":"Had the Tuscan. Great sandwich! Sliced-to-order meat (and plenty of it) vs. pre-sliced/wrapped meat makes all the difference. Nice soft bread does not overpower the meat. Friendly, polite staff. Check them out."}
{"text":"In last 1 year we ordered cake 3 times and every time it was a hit,,,,so thumbs up for European Bakery...and the best part is that they also make eggless cakes....."}
{"text":"Really good. We split a sandwich, a piece of cake, and we bought a loaf of bread. The sandwich was fresh and had high quality meat and cheese. The roll was soft on the inside and crunchy in the outside. Not that hard crust that you can't bite through or the one that crumbles up.  The cake was also soft and yummy. The chocolate and pastry cream was not to sweet. Both items were large and just enough for two people to share. The bread smells so good. I plan on having some with dinner later tonight. The staff was helpful and nice to deal with.  So stop by and treat yourself for lunch and bring home some goodies for the family."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been craving macaroons for so long! They import them from France and they're so delicious. The subs are amazing here too. My husband got the Italian and I got the turkey caprese! Both had awesome flavor and were huge! The only drawback was that it was a tad bit expensive. But definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I found this place looking for a quality cake for my mother's birthday. Sampled their individual slices and they were excellent. When I ordered the cake I ordered a sandwich for lunch. OMG good. Fresh and flavorful ample portion that could be shared but I couldn't stop eating it."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches OF MY LIIIIFE. (I get the roast beef with horseradish). The desserts are amazing too, especially the cream puffs and the kremish thing. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"We visited this place on a recommendation from a co-worker. He told us of the great sandwiches they serve, and he was especially effusive of the bread. I can say we weren't disappointed. 

The sandwiches are made fresh to order and they definitely don't skimp on the meat. The bread was every bit as tasty as our co-worker made it out to be. It was soft and perfectly baked, and not too dense. Though the service was a bit on the slower side, the owner was very friendly and sat down and chatted with us while we ate. 

We're definitely adding this place to our regurlar lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Rude and insensitive.  They communicate incorrectly to their customers and don't apologize. They make us feel as though they are doin us a favor.  Cakes taste like cheap stuff and not worth it one bit."}
{"text":"Bread tasted like wonder bread. Worst bread we've ever bsught. Croissant was stale. The sweets may be better I hope."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries from the Napoleon to dobos to all European favorites. The bread and baguettes are best in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs!  Great bread, delicious blend of meats, fresh lettuce, olives and topped with a wonderful vinegar and oil dressing.  Pastry for desert was spot on, and the poppy seed strudel we took home was the best we've had in Phoenix so far.  
Restaurant is small, I think four tables and is located in a small strip mall.  Don't let the outside scare you off, this place deserves a try!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been in for the sandwiches and they are the best in the valley. I have tried at least half the sandwiches on the menu and I would be hard pressed to tell you which is the best. The bread is made fresh. They is plenty of meat and cheese. I can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"The customer service we got was super friendly. Seems like a small family run business which I liked! I got two pastry desserts while we were here: the napoleon and the fruit cake. The Napoleon was very flaky, custard filled, and delicious. However, the fruit cake was still frozen.... It was 11:30am and they opened at 10am. They still didn't have all of their breads ready for lunch time. I ordered the Da Vinci, but they had to substitute the original bread with whatever they had which ended up tasting stale."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good cremesh (yelp wouldn't let me spell it correctly) and rulou. The current Armenian owners acquired this gem from the previous owners who were Romanian, somehow managed to maintain the recipes. The Romanian flag is still displayed on the window, but again,  no longer run by Romanians. Service could be better."}
{"text":"They have Kabanos, Kielbasa, and all sorts of great deli meats.  They also carry assorted European foods in jars. 

Their sandwiches are delicious, though you should know that a \"half\" is two full slices and a \"whole\" is just two sandwiches.  Why?  I don't know. 

The only, only complaint I have is it's a cash only place and I don't carry cash.  Still, it's often worth stopping by an ATM on the way."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.   They have some very special ice cream that is very hard to find in the Valley.   The owners make you feel like your in Europe, nice and friendly."}
{"text":"What a great little place!  The fresh baked break and sandwiches made with meat sliced to order are just perfect.  The sandwiches are really big and reasonably priced for the size, easily enough for 2 people to share, especially if you save room for dessert, which you definitely should do.  There is a lovely dessert case with lots of pretty things inside.  So far I have tried 5 different pastries, and all have been really good.  Not the best desserts I have ever had, but definitely very tasty. The only drawback is very slow service.  There was only one man working up front the day we tried lunch, and he was making all of the sandwiches himself.  Since everything is made to order, this is not the place to go if you are in a rush, but if you have the time it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The customer service at this location was horrific. The cake received wasn't what was ordered and they did nothing but show frustration instead of take the opportunity to provide good customer service. Regardless of the issue, customers should at least be treated with respect no matter who's mistake it was. The cake was not worth it. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am convinced that Phoenix needs MANY more dessert and coffee places; the kind where one can while away the time with a good friend and feel just a little more adult.  Having made that desire known, I enlisted the aid of my good buddy and set about finding such an establishment.  I have been craving cake in the worst way.  Not just ANY cake but the kind that has an equal amount of thought put into both frosting AND cake.  We settled on this joint, having read the lovely reviews from fellow Yelp-ers beforehand.  So, first things first, it's a tiny little place and not necessarily frilly or fancy.  No matter, there were some nice tables outside and some really friendly folks inside to help us make the best cake choices.  Bonus: the cake slices are small enough that having two did not send either of us into a shame spiral over our lack of control.  I had a chocolate-raspberry and another whose name escapes me.  My buddy had a pineapple and another that was made with compressed puff pastry.  We sat outside for 3 hours and chatted about everything under the sun.  During that time, we were entertained by fellow bakery goers, people with cute puppies, and a smattering of humanity.  It was a nice experience and one I will most assuredly repeat!"}
{"text":"So My Italian father made the Best Italian subs in the land.... this place gets as close as you can to pa pa's..... Beautiful meat and cheese and bread,  family owned nice people.. and to copy another review  \"The quality of the subs completely exceeds anything you can get at the usual nearby chains.\" This is the real deal... little whole in the wall totally worth it , I guess they have desert too, I never got passed the subs LOL (oh they use real lettuce not that head lettuce crap )"}
{"text":"Such good sandwiches! The meat is cut fresh just as your Sammy is made. Desserts to die for. Plus the family that runs this joint is cute! Yummm!"}
{"text":"My Dad was in from out of town and wanted to stop by Subway. I would rather support small local restaurants so I got on Yelp and found European Bakery and Café. After speaking with the owner (I'm assuming he was the owner) he recommended getting the Black Forest and Bostonian. Both were a great deal for the price. I actually had leftovers for lunch the next day. I tasted both, which my favorite was the Black Forest. It had some maple turkey, honey ham, honey mustard and some other goodies. They had a big display of cakes which we couldn't resist so we ordered a few to eat later. They were equally just as awesome. I highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Can only comment on the Italian sub and the pastrami  but, both were really good. Loaded with meat! We will be back to try the cannoli!!"}
{"text":"I have been looking to try macaroons for sometime. They were amazing!!!!! 
Definitely will be going back for more. 
 They have a very fluffy, air like cake. It wasn't bad just not my kind of cake. I like heavy and sweet cake. 
Definitely recommend this place if you like airy fluffy cake and of course for macaroons.

Super friendly workers."}
{"text":"Good little bakery as far flavors go, not impressed with their selection, was hoping for more options."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for their subs. They slice the deli meat in front of you and use fresh toppings. They offer a huge selection of baked goods, none which have disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"Great!  So many choices!  The cases are overflowing with deliciousness!  It will take a lot of visits to try everything."}
{"text":"I tried birth day cakes in all the places like coldstone, frys, alerbertson and so on..  Finally, I found the right place. This is very very good but little bit costly."}
{"text":"I ordered coffee mocha birthday cake for my kid. It was delicious so I referred to my friends too. No doubt they maintain quality and taste. They losing  one star for the waiting time. Always i have to wait for pickup :("}
{"text":"I love this please very friendly! They have great sandwich   the meats and cheese are imported. Not much on sweets but pastries perfect size they are so decadent!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came across this bakery unexpectedly. I tried the fruit cake and my husband had the mango cake. We really enjoyed our respective cakes. The fruit cake was moist, adequately sweetened, and included fruit as a filling with a strawberry on top. The bakery is a distance from home, but we will be back to try more delicious desserts."}
{"text":"For me, half of the pleasure of going out for coffee, alone or with friends, is partaking of a well-made cake or other pastry to go with the coffee. The place that fits the bill is this, my cafe of choice when I find myself in the west side of town. Their baked goods are top-notch, service is friendly, and although the place is small, it seems that there's always a place to sit, relax, and indulge in their sweet offerings."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  Service was great, the family that runs this bakery was very friendly.  We tried some cream puffs, tiramisu, some
Chocolate mousse and ice cream.  The vanilla ice cream was delicious, the mousse was way to rich for any of us to eat, the other goodies were, well just ok."}
{"text":"The best European Pastry's I ever found in the Phoenix-Metro Area. If you are used to have a beautiful and very tasty European Pastry's for the Holidays and don't have the time to make it, this is the place to pick-up some goodies for any event! Always Very fresh! Also try their bread it is Best in Town!"}
{"text":"Subs were bomb and the dessert were off the hook. I definitely recommend this place. Great food, good prices and the service was nice. Thank you ladies"}
{"text":"Best place to come and get desserts & bread from! They have Romanian Desserts!

They have my favorite cake which is Dobos( it's layers of chocolate!) 

Also you can order birthday cakes from here. Also you can order other cakes and they will have it ready for you to pick it up. 

Also the bread tastes amazing. They can also slice the bread for you. 

They also make sandwiches. 

They are closed on Sunday & Monday"}
{"text":"Incredible dessert case!  Solid lunch place for sandwiches on wonderful homemade bread.  Dessert case is studded with amazing sweets!"}
{"text":"Great bakery. I grabbed a sandwich, a load of multigrain bread and a slice of rum cake to share with my honey. I has the bruschetta sandwich which is a great vegetarian option. It's big enough to share on a dense roll. Big slices of mozzarella pesto and tomatoes. The loaf was fantastic and I can't wait to try more desserts"}
{"text":"This is a cute little shop,  the young lady who helped me was very nice.  This was the first time here, so I was not sure what all they had.  The selection is okay.  I would have liked more chocolate items.  The Kreme Horn I had was delicious.  Wish I would have gotten another.  I was disappointed in the macaroons,  I expected them to be freshly made.  Sign said imported,  I tried them anyway.  They had no real flavor, w as very disappointed.  I will be back to try a sandwich as the fresh made bread looked good. My mom did like the pecan tart I got for her,  so that is a plus."}
{"text":"I love this place, and the pastry is so delicious. if you want real pastry, ditch the AJ's and the other places and go here. You won't be disappointed! 

Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!! Found this on Yelp while looking for another. The reviews stopped me dead in my tracks!! After reading them, THIS was the place I wanted to try!! 

When you walk in, you smell the fresh breads!!! Ahhhh, that intoxicating aroma....

Ordered the Italian and what a surprise!! First off, the bread - crusty on the outside and soft, soft on the inside.  Then there was THE bite of that provolone cheese!! Never in all my years of eating \"sub sandwiches\" have I ever tasted provolone like that!! Wowzer!! I was told they import it from Italy and boy, my mouth is happy!! The meats were exceptional also, along with the olives,  etc.

Hubby got the \"All American \" , and what's not to like about bologna, ham and turkey!! He loved loved loved it!!

And of course, since it IS a Bakery, we had to partake!! I got the German Chocolate Cake, hubby got the Kremeshe Krempita... can you say, \"Best Ever\"??!!! Yum yum yum!!

We even got a loaf of sour dough to go, sliced, and a tuna sandwich and another Italian. It is the weekend, and they are not open on Sundays, sooooooooo.... we had to lay in supplies!!

And, get this!!! The tuna salad is NOT sitting in a vat waiting to be scooped out and plopped into the roll.... noooooo, it is made fresh! That's right - FRESH!! Then it is put into the cooler, while the rest of the sandwich is prepared, then spread on at the very last minute!! How about that!!

Do yourself a favor- GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"What a waste of gas and money. 

I made the drive from Mesa and I was utterly disappointed. The shop is small, hot and not up to my standard of cleanliness. But I was there and I had to try them. 

We order the mango mousse and pistachio macaron. The mango mousse is layered between cake and has mango gelee on top. The cake was flavorless and dry, the mousse lacked flavor and could barely tell it was supposed to taste like mango and it was dry. How do you get dry mousse??? Ask Eorupean Bakery, they should be able to tell you. Mango mousse? Mango not.

The macaron was a disaster. It was over baked and the shell was nothing but a giant air bubble, being hollow inside. The filling wasn't spread out and only had some in the middle. My biggest issue with the pistachio macaron was that it was not pistachio! It you're going to make a pistachio macaron, you are supposed to use pistachio meal, not almond meal like traditional macaron. You can't use 90% almond and 10% pistachio and tint it green and call is pistachio. No, just no. How do you sell macaron so sub par to your customers? 

While \"enjoying\" our sweets, we observed the staff with couple of other customers and their cake orders. The cake looked good on the outside but what is it with their packaging?? If someone orders a large sheet cake, can you provide a little more than just a flimy box bottom? Use a cardboard and a real box that's actually big enough for the cake please. The service was slow and their napkin holders were out of napkins and I brought it to their attention but they never refilled it."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! 
The bread is fresh, the sauces homemade and the meat is sliced for your order.
We came in for sandwiches only, and left after dessert with a loaf of pumpernickel for the house. 
My girlfriend fell in love with the Boston Cream cake, and vows to try each of the dozen plus pastries they make. The owners were really sweet and chatted us up while we ate. No questions needed; we will be back to this place SOON."}
{"text":"Home made horse radish on roast beef  wonderful fresh sandwich   .... Great find for a lunch with ur family"}
{"text":"Not what I expected from the cafe part in the name. Three tables with two chairs each table is more a Bistro in my opinion.I was greeted by a gentleman who was friendly and eager to help us decide what to order from his menu. I went with the Bostonian Roast beef sandwich. The bread was to die for. As I bit into the bread you got a great crunch from the outside of the bread and a soft light inside. The Roast Beef was Fresh and had the perfect color to it which told a story of its freshness. Don't expect fast service as they cut all the meats when you order you sandwich. The extra time is worth the wait. I am anxious to go back and try the prosciutto sandwich on my next go. Although I did not have a desert, I have to say they were tempting. Visually amazing looking. Couldn't tell you how they taste since my New Years resolution is to eat healthier so I passed.
I would recommend this place and I know you will enjoy. Not quite sure why he doesn't have more patrons at 1:20 on a Tue.
ENJOY!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh great they have an order APP. I ordered my lunch and note that I would pick up at 12:00 noon. (which was an hour later)  I go there and they didnt have my lunch ready, didnt even know an order was placed (and paid for) I had to wait another 20 minutes for them to make up a simple sandwich. I would have just left and go somewhere else but I had already paid for my lunch GRRR. Never will go back and I told them so! They didn't even have rye bread as ordered. Really too bad as this is close to where I work but I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool however it is not super fresh on the pastries and cakes. I think a lot of stuff is ordered and comes frozen. Not really what I expected. I didn't try the bread but it looked really good and I think that is fresh. The family that runs it is super nice."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have had in Phoenix! I loved the Italian and the smell of fresh bread when you walk in took me right back to little Italy in Chicago and the Bronx. My sandwich was huge and I was only able to eat half. Wish I could have saved more room for baked goods! My professor has ordered numerous cakes and baked goods from here and has said that they turned out great!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best subs you will ever eat. 

1. Fresh baked bread
2. perfect selection of hand picked meats and cheeses
3. Quality toppings, sauces etc. 
4. Bang for your buck. HUGE subs.
5. Try the sweets!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time this week to grab a sandwiches for the office. The sandwiches were large enough for two people. Filled with freshly sliced meat can cheeses as well as in house fresh baked bread! 

They have racks of tasty sweets and bread as well as house made gelatin! Go see these guys!"}
{"text":"Stop by today based on the great reviews and was not disappointed. Store was clean, staff was friendly, and was surprised to see a large selection of pastries being it was a little late in the day.  We tried the fruit cake (strawberry, kiwi, mango), German chocolate cake, and a cannoli. The fruit cake was amazing. It was super moist, with a strong fruit flavor, and very sweet. The German was also super moist and very flavorful. This coming from a guy who does not really love German cake. Lastly, the cannoli was very good and tasted as expected."}
{"text":"Pastries look decent, taste decent. Prices could be lower. Bought 2 coffees and 2 pieces of pastry and 1 loaf of bread for $19. That's a price you can charge people only once. Please be friendlier to entering customers. A simple welcome is all we ask. Please adjust your prices so people can just 'stop by' instead of 'planning' a visit. Again, greet people and thank people for their visit, so they feel appreciated for their business."}
{"text":"European bakery featuring popular cakes such as the Napoleon and Tiramisu, sandwiches, coffee, cold drinks, and fresh bread.

Service is great and the prices are affordable. A great small business."}
{"text":"I live in California and needed a cake for my brothers engagement. The reviews on this bakery lead me to order a cake and macaroons. Got the cake and everyone loved it!  It was super moist and a lot of great flavor. And I got a small cake because I didn't think anyone would eat cake, but of course it was all eaten. It was perfect. While we were bringing it home. Somehow some wAy we messed up the frosting. I called bakery and I took it back for them to touch up. I even offered to pay for touch up but they did not take the money. Great customer service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice service.. The ladies are very polite and courteous.. Cakes are fresh and tastes really good.. I had ordered a birthday cake and the cake was made as I wanted it.. Really loved it.."}
{"text":"I got a Tuscan Sandwich. It was so good that it made me angry. The meat is sliced to order so everything takes a little longer but that sandwich OMG!!! They seem to have every deli meat there is from capicola to a couple of different salamis. You could have roasted peppers to olives there's a plethora of options and the bread is so fresh. I got my wife a tiramisu just so she can become addicted to this place and give me a reason to go out of my way to go back there because it's completely out of my way."}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  It was recommended by a friend, and we thought we'd pick up some pastries to take to an outing he was having at noonish, and wanted to get them fresh, so we drove over on Sat. morning. They don't open till 10, which we thought strange.  My husband is from Chicago, and the bakeries there open at 6:30-7:00 (start baking at 4 am).  Walked in at 10:04. There was one other customer there. It was 10:10 before someone peeked around the door from the back and saw us. We were taken aback by how empty the shelves were, but figured that they hadn't brought out the \"freshly baked\" products yet.  We were surprised and disappointed when we were told that they things we went there for were LEFTOVERS from Friday, and they didn't have the ones with our favorite filling.  We asked for a loaf of rye bread and were told that someone from Black Canyon City had come down and wiped them out.  We saw some baguettes, and wanted to get one, but she told us that they, too, were yesterday's LEFOVERS and that she didn't want to sell us one. Since we had driven there, we did decide to buy a dozen of the LEFTOVER pastries for the outing. The charge was $9.01.  We gave her a $10 bill and she gave us back $.99 in change!!!!  Come on, we told her that this was our first visit so you'd thought she would have eaten that penny.  The pastries were tasty, but were somewhat dry......they weren't fresh!  We won't be returning to European Bakery.

By the way, the other customer there said it was also her first visit. She wanted some cupcakes
but was told that those were also LEFTOVERS from Friday.  Not sure if she wound up buying
anything.

{"text":"Wow! Very delicious sandwiches! My husband and I agreed their sandwiches are the best we've had in Phoenix so far, They are not typical subs at all. They are made with very fresh meat, cheese and veggies and really mouthwatering. Especially I liked the delicious cheese. We had a prosciutto sandwich ($8.99) and black forest sandwich($6.99). I also loved the honey mustard sauce in my black forest sandwich. 

After eating sandwiches, we decided to have some desserts. I was totally overwhelmed by the selection of nice looking cakes. They had coconut cream mousse, chocolate pistachio mousse, caramel apple mousse, chocolate cup mousse, cream horns, tiramisu, napoleon, cannoli, etc. etc. don't they all sound yummy?  I finally decided to try something new to me. I forgot the name but it's a kind of pudding with fruits and two kinds of creams in rum syrup. The lady working there told me it's popular in Vulcan countries. My husband had cherry chocolate mousse. We were both satisfied with our choices. And they are $2.95 and $3.95, which I think quite reasonable. 

It's a small place with 5 tables or so and I think family-owned. People working there are nice and friendly. Thier food is mostly Italian/French style with some East European taste.

Next time I want to try their bread or croissant.
I wish this place was located closer to our home but probably worth driving all the way to get there."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to get me to write a review on Yelp. But I will say, The Naples sandwich is one of the best Sandwiches in Phoenix. Period.  I am very impressed with the hand-slicing of all the deli meat at time of order, the fresh baked bread, and the very tasty condiments including homemade pesto and Italian dressing.

You'd hope a family of bakers from the North End of Boston knows how to make a proper Grinder. And at the European Bakery and Cafe, they do! The grinders don't disappoint. I will be back, often!"}
{"text":"We came in to try the desserts and they tasted amazing!!I decided to get a Ham and Swiss sandwich as well and it was so tastey and fresh!So friendly and was a great experience!"}
{"text":"The subs here are some of the best you can find! The Priscuitto di Parma is my personal favorite, with the Da Vinci and Italian also being excellent choices. If you find their size intimidating, you can ask for just half a sandwich. The quality of the subs completely exceeds anything you can get at the usual nearby chains.

As for their desserts, they have a wide variety of cake slices you can purchase. We're huge fans of their honey cake, but they have plenty of other choices to satisfy your sugar cravings. Chocolate mocha, coconut creme, and German chocolate are just a few examples. The problem is, however, since this is a Mom and Pop bakery, they aren't making these cakes through a massive assembly line that always guarantees freshness. Due to this, you might end up with a slice of cake that is somewhat stale and has probably been sitting in on their fridge for far too long. This has happened to us on a couple of occasions. So if you really want to try the best they have to offer, ask them what cake on the shelf is the most recently made.

I see a lot of people going in and out with cakes for special occasions. I've never had the opportunity to try one, but I have a feeling based on the awards these people have won that they're probably very good.

Stop by and get yourself a sub and some dessert. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great bakery, they have really fresh baked goods every day.  It smells amazing when you walk in!  The sandwiches are also really good too.  I haven't tried the coffee or gelato but I'm sure its as good as everything else."}
{"text":"Ok I agree that the owner(s) may be quirky.  Adds to the charm of the place as far as I am concerned.  I went there on Wednesday only to discover they don't open until 10 am.  Thought that was kinda weird for a bakery. Went back the next day @ 4 and there wasn't alot left but what was there looked fab.
Let me explain I am not a fan of most european bakeries sweets because they are well......... just too sweet.  I do love the breads and the pretzels.  I also love a good plain coffee roll, strudel, ect.  Not sweet but more on the flakey flavorful side of things.   So while I skipped the eclairs, kreme horns, ect I did try a coffee roll and a french baquette. 
Let me say that it is the BEST french baquette I have had since I was in Europe.  Hands down.  The coffee roll was my breakfast the next morning and frankly I almost went right than to buy more of them.
Yummo! 
To top it off, the elderly lady in front of me ordered a loaf of sliced bread and then discovered she didn't have any cash or her check book and was embarrased to tears.  The owner GAVE her the bread.  Some might say 'big deal it was only 3 bucks\" to which I say YES it is a big deal.   Kindness is always a big deal to me.  I will go back to this quirky kind place with great food."}
{"text":"Really yummy sandwich and for a great price! Great fresh bread and delicious deli meats. I wish this place was closer to where I live!!"}
{"text":"Adorable little place that's family owned and operated. A father and his two daughters it seems. A wonderful array of pastries and cakes and macaroons to choose from!

The daughters are friendly and sweet. We ordered two iced coffees and they were perfect. We would've ordered pastries or a piece of cake but it was still too early in the day for us. 

We'll definitely be back to taste what they have to offer."}
{"text":"The cakes there are absolutely scrumptious. It's light, airy and moist. The chocolate mousse cup is totally worth every penny of its $5 price tag. The chocolate is rich but light and melts in your mouth. I had to drive 35 miles out of my way to go to this bakery, but it was well worth the trip and I will definitely come back from now on. I just wish they were open earlier."}
{"text":"Every time we are in the Phoenix area, we make a point to come here! Their sandwiches are a generous size, and super fresh. And, we always make sure to get a loaf of fresh bread. The food is always phenomenal. I would love to give them 5 stars, however, service is super slow! It takes about 30-40 minutes for them to make a sandwich. So, be prepared to wait, or call your order in advance."}
{"text":"First off - great sandwich, one of the best in the area.  The bread and cold cuts are top quality.  The ambiance is pretty poor.  And this is why I dinged them - service is horrid, incredibly slow, they take forever to get anything done, and they let the phone ring and ring, there are usually 3-5 ppl milling about behind the counter but it doesn't speed anything up.  If I arrive and notice two ppl waiting ahead of me, I leave, because I don't have 45 minutes to wait for a sandwich to be made.  Again, the food is great, ambiance poor and the service kills this place."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place !!!!!!!! you must !!!!!!! They have really delicious bread and cakes. I have been looking for this kind of place because I am tired of walmart or fry's bread. I am really happy to find this place~ I only tried their cakes and bread but I will try subs oneday."}
{"text":"While vacationing with mom in Arizona, I searched for Romanian food!! This place came across and gave it a shot. Old, dirty chairs. Spoke a few words in Romanian yet the staff pretended to not understand me. Interesting, since there was no problem for her and rest of family to communicate in Romanian. Big deal to reply back in the language I spoke first? My mom only speaks Romanian .. and You guys have a small Romanian flag painted on the front window, next to the American one. 
Had Honey Cake ... dry. Savarina .. too watery. Chocolate Mouse .. just dry.  Unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Tried their Italian sandwich, it was not my taste. Tried the honey cake and Boston cream cake too and they both tasted old. Meh. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to leave reviews regardless of the experience I have. But I felt the need to leave one for this place. I walk in and half of the dessert displays are empty, but I thought to my self that it's early in the day, so it's no biggie. I order their Italian sandwich and they notify me that they're out of Baguettes! How does a bakery/deli that makes EVERY single sandwich on their menu on a Baguette, run out of Baguettes? So I decided against their other bread options for the sandwich and canceled that order. I got the German Chocolate cake and a Cafe Americano instead. The cake was insanely dry, it felt as if I was eating baking flour straight out the bag. Also, the coffee was watered down beyond belief. I'd definitely pass on this place until they improve their business quality."}
{"text":"I visited European Bakery for lunch today. It was extremely slow, even though it was only myself and one other guest. There were three people behind the counter, two women with facial hair and one man. I ordered the chicken salad and they kept asking me what I wanted on it over and over after I kept telling them, they would just forget. After about fifteen minutes I received my sandwich. It was just okay, nothing spectacular. Some of the desserts in there looked amazing, however I will not be back due to the slow service."}
{"text":"First time in this little joint, its a very unique little bakery, but i stoped in for a sub sandwich because a friend of mine told me they were delicious. Ordered the Italian, which was pretty good, they even put green olives on it which i thought was a really tasty touch. I love capicola ham, and i couldnt taste it to much with the vinegar and all thw stuff on it, but it was still a very tasty sub. Not sure if it was worth the $10.25 they charge for it though. But non the less check this little place out if you get a chance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to order cakes. We ordered our wedding cake from them and as well as my son's birthday cake and they both turned out amazing. Their prices are beyond reasonable, they taste amazing and look fantastic"}
{"text":"Been up here a few times as it's close to work.. Came with 2 different subsets of coworkers and both loved the deli sandwiches. One group was into the desserts and they said its one of the best they've had...

Deli meats, awesome flavor and very fresh.. 
Hospitality is above par !! 

Great work guys, Keep up the good work, and see you on my next trip up in that area !!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that the sandwich I just finished eating was the best I have ever had, and being from the east coast where Deli's are a way of life that is no small task. The meat is incredible quality, I got the Louie XVI which was cured ham, turkey, havarti, let/tom/onion and amazing mustard. My boyfriend got the Italian which was just as wonderful! The bread was fresh, flaky on the outside, soft in the middle. They offer a lot more sandwiches now, and the pastries are incredible. I saw a lot of cakes coming out of the kitchen for pickup, and they looked beautiful.The owner was very personable and friendly, and I will definitely be back.

I'm not sure why they don't have their website linked, but if you want to check out the menu go to eurobakeryaz.com, it's a PDF so if the menu doesn't pull up try a different browser. It's located between the Dollar Store and Bedsmart on the Northwest corner of 35th Ave and Bell."}
{"text":"What a great find.  Thanks Yelp.

I was really craving a great deli sandwich and after searching through Yelp I decided to head to European Bakery and Deli and was greated by the owner was very nice and assisted with picking out a great sandwich for my taste.  I went with the Prosciutto di Parma which had authentic Prosciutto and fresh cut cheese and lettuce with oil and vinegar.  It was very delicious.  

The Bakery looked amazing with tons of great dessert items that I was way too full to try but it gives me a reason to head back right?"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came in here to buy some pastries for a friends birthday. They have a beautiful display of hand made European cakes, cookies and pastries.  Along with the treats for my friend, We also ordered a Black Forest  sub sandwich, loaded with ham and cheese, crisp lettuce wrapped in fresh baked bread.  The bread was so good we bought a loaf for home.
The owners were friendly and made us feel welcome. Will definatly be back."}
{"text":"I was craving a sandwich and one of the chain type places would not cut it.  I saw this place while driving to work one day (they have a huge banner out front...they won Best Bakery in Phoenix 2013 I guess.) and decided to come here for lunch the other day.  I walked in the joint and felt a bit uneasy at first.  The space is a bit cluttered (they have stuff thrown about on a few tables like its an office) and I didn't see too many items in the display cases.  I was greeted by a nice lady who asked me what I wanted.  I ordered the Italian sandwich.  She grabbed a loaf of bread from the display case, then got down to business.  They keep their meats in a regular refrigerator  next to the sandwich prep station.  She started unwrapping meats and cheese and started slicing them up.  It took her awhile because of so many meats on this thing!   It was made fresh on the spot though so that was awesome!  Kind of reminded me of a deli from back east in Philly.  She assembled my sandwich, I paid her $10.00 and I was on my way.  Here is how it tasted....................

Italian Sandwich-  This thing was packed to the gills!  It had mortadella, castagna (never heard of it before), sopresatta, capacola, provolone and veggies (olives, lettuce, red peppers, tomatoes).  Every single meat was sliced thin and of the highest quality!  This was some good stuff.  Not sure what brand of meat they use, but it was top shelf!  The cheese was a nice sharp provolone sliced razor thin.  It was great!  The lettuce was crisp, there was plenty of olives, and the Italian dressing was tasty.  The only weak part of the sandwich was the tomatoes (I say its due to the fact that AZ has pretty shitty produce in general).  The bread that this was served on was soft yet had a crispy sturdy exterior.  It was really good bread and worked perfectly for this sandwich!

4 stars for now and it was probably the best sandwich I have had in Phoenix besides Pane Biancos Sopresatta.  I'm sure I will be back if a hoagie hankering hits me."}
{"text":"Not in this area very often, so I turned to Yelp to find something unique. The strip mall looks older and the atmosphere inside is small and basic. Put the #3 Prosciutto sandwich was out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little mom & pop bakery. Fresh breads, pastries, coffee and sandwiches.
Two young (TWINS), sweet and extremely friendly ladies greeted us and both handles our order. Can't wait to go back...ai think we found our permanent place for fresh baked bread and sweets."}
{"text":"I must say that this is a 5 star combination of those things that make an establishment deserve the coveted 5th star~

Excellent, Friendly Customer Service 
Fresh, High Quality Ingredients
and Superb Quality Control

The Pastrami is DELICIOUS here!

The fresh $2.99 loaves are huge!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  

Mmm, Bread.  }^ )"}
{"text":"LOVE the macarons, they are imported from Europe! much better, and more natural tasting than Le Napoleon down the road. I spoke to the owner on my last visit and told him I've heard amazing reviews about his bread. I'm gluten free so i was a bit sad that I wouldn't be able to try it, but because a lot of the time gluten intolerances are due to preservatives processed with the wheat, not the wheat itself, he gave, yes GAVE, me a roll to take home so I could try just a small bit! SO kind! when I got home, i took a tiny piece-- being extremely scared of getting sick, but in that tiny bite there was so much freshness!! You must try their bread. the other pastries and mouses looked fabulous as well, and decently priced!"}
{"text":"Delicious bear claws, a bit small but yummy. 
Light pastry and not too sweet. I like this place very much. I wish they were open daily."}
{"text":"My friend and I just had lunch here this afternoon. All I can say is \"WOW!\". I had the New Yorker sub. After I finished the half of the sandwich, I was stuffed. So, tempted by the treats and fresh baked bread, I splurged.  The pastries are wonderful. I haven't tried the Stone Ground Wheat bread yet, but from the enticing aroma, I'm certain it is just as wonderful. I can't wait to go back.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Great cakes! This tastes just as good as any of the overrated Italian bakeries that you find in Manhattan, NYC with thousands of reviews - at about half the price. Had the Mille Feuille Napoleon and the Krempita cake (both for $2.99). Both were amazing. If gaining weight and diabetes didn't exist, I would have gladly eaten both in one sitting. Would love to come again and try the other cakes!"}
{"text":"\"A party without cake is really just a meeting.\" ? Julia Child

On one particularly busy work day, my friend had dropped by to surprise me with a midday sweet!  Opening the box with care, there were so many to choose from.  Out of all the slices I was bestowed, I chose the Day & Night Cake. The chocolate part of the cake was light, fluffy, and moist.  The white cake on the other hand was dry.  It also had a sprinkling of walnuts in between the layers of cake.  Overall, I found the cake to be a tad too sweet for my liking.  When asking my friend how the other slices fair, it seemed to be a pattern that the white cakes were dry while the chocolate ones fair better.  He also said the hazelnut cake was the most impressive as it had actual hazelnut.

At $2.99 a slice, you're getting a pretty good quality slice.  While I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in for a sweet treat, I wouldn't decline a slice if it was presented to me either!  ;)"}
{"text":"This is the best hole-in-the-wall bakery that everyone needs to try!!  If you blink when driving by, you'd miss it, but turn around - go back!  The family/staff there are awesome, friendly, helpful and knowledgable.  Their eclairs there are da bomb!!  Anything you order comes in a nice little bakery box, including sandwiches, bread, eclairs, cakes, pastries, etc.  They are open late (for a bakery) until 6:30 or 7:00pm and are very clean, organized, tasty and professional.  I highly recommend this Bakery for special occasions or just dropping by to get an eclair on the way home from work.  It's worth the trip!  And it's right next door to Dollar Tree at 35th Avenue/Bell."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with the quality of the products at this bakery. I wanted to buy one of everything but I controlled myself. I tried the cream horns, Napoleons, walnut cookies and raspberry cookies. All of them were delicious and made with high quality ingredients. I asked if they could make me a jelly roll and they said sure. If you don't see what you want just ask. They are friendly and will go out of their way to accommodate you. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to come here for sometime. When the idea pops in my head they are closed. So glad it worked out today. I got the Italian sandwich that was out of this world and perfectly layered. Lots of love put in this sammie. I will a be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"I had been told this Was am amazing place by a friend w wonderful service.  However when we got there the girl at register was most unfriendly.  She would not smile at all.  I tried making small talk and she was just very cold.  I finally had to ask her if she ever smiled. She was nicer after that. 

The sandwich I had was very delicious. I probably wouldn't return due to service.  The cakes they sold,  chocolates and desserts looked very yummy."}
{"text":"So this quaint little shop is located in an area that does not do it justice. We went in and it reminded me if my Nana's house. They greeted us when we entered and since it wasn't very busy we got all the attention. We ordered 2 of the Black Forest and 1 DaVinci. It took a while to make but that was because he (the man making the sandwich) had to grab fresh baked bread and slice all the meats and cheeses for each sandwich. So the Black Forest has turkey, ham and havarti with lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard. Everything was as fresh as you could imagine no slimy meat. The DaVinci had ham, salami, provolone, pepperoncini, lettuce, tomato, and Italian seasoning with olive oil. My niece explained it as \"shear ecstasy dancing on my tongue\". We then had the lemon mousse in a chocolate cup with a strawberry on top. It was so good and was gone within a minute. We had a half a sandwich each to take home for later. All in all it was great and I will be going back and taking friends.
I know that one person said that there were only 5 sandwiches but there were many more on the menu when I went in today.  The servers were exellent quirky yes but friendly. I even asked about my iced tea but he said that it was his own mixture.  Great fun.
Went there again and got another dessert some sort of custard with whip cream and puff pastry with powdered sugar. Yum"}
{"text":"Amazing! The bread is delish. Hard to find good bread in Az. The chicken salad hoagie I had was very good. The second best I have had in Phx and that is saying a lot. The desserts are amazing. I met a wonderfully nice customer while in line and we chatted like old friends. (Can I tell you how much I love my new neighborhood.  I can actually talk with my neighbors and not hide from them-ha) The owner came out and joined in the conversation. That was cool. There is one lady who works behind the counter that is not very outgoing and seemed annoyed when people ordered things. That seemed weird but I think that is just her way, The other gal is very personable. This is a great place to have a sandwich and some treats. By the way, their coffee is very good here too, if you just want a good, plain cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Europe, I consider baked good an art form that is generally lost to Americans. Bread here tend to be tasteless and artificial. Thankfully I know of this bakery. They make all their goods from scratch in house using European ingredients and the results are nothing if not baking nirvana. Best bread in town bar none. The baked cakes are artistically decorated and mouthwateringly delicious. On top of being the best bakery this side of the Atlantic, they are also very affordable. You will pay no more for a fresh loaf of delicious bread here than you would in a supermarket for their \"artisan\" breads, and this bread makes the supermarket stuff taste downright offensive. No wonder they won best of Phoenix last year."}
