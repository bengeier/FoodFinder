{"text":"Great spot in downtown Toronto. Friendly service, modern decor, and interesting and tasty food."}
{"text":"Was in town on a birthday trip for a friend and staying at a hotel right down the street so we decided to try Real Mo-Mo's. We didn't have to wait for a table, the service was great, and everything that my girlfriend and I tried tasted so incredibly fresh. That's always a good sign. We actually wound up eating here twice during our stay, not because of proximity, but due to to the fact that we really enjoyed the atmosphere. To top it off, the background music was excellent!  We were able to chat with the lovely owner, Mo-Mo, and came to know her a little bit. Now her menu choices make so much sense and that just adds to the cuteness of the place. I would definitely recommend and plan to stop in the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was in the Yonge and King area, starving at brunch time and googling some place where my friend and I could eat brunch.  Real Mo-Mos was around the corner from her condo and had strong reviews so we decided to go.    We are both picky eaters (She can't eat eggs and I can't eat wheat flour (gluten) so finding some place to eat breakfast/brunch is usually a struggle, someone mentioned gluten free options so we decided to check it out.  We were both impressed. The prices were reasonable and we were both full after eating our meals. (We both have healthy appetites and have left several restaurants hungry after receiving small portion sizes, but not here.)   The food was simple, but flavourful and delicious and we could find dishes that accommodated both of our diets without having lengthy discussions with the waitress about substitutions.   They have a high tea option that seemed really interesting, but we would have to check it out another day and it didn't seem to include many gluten free options, but I didn't ask.   Overall, we were quite impressed with the ambience, the food and the prices and we agreed that it would be added to our weekend brunch rotation. The service was great too."}
{"text":"Great food, service and people!  You've hit the mark, MoMo!  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch last week because the wait at Petit Dejeuner was an hour. Mo mo's was quiet and cozy with professional and friendly service. I've recently become allergic to wheat and eggs so navigating a breakfast menu can be a bit tricky. When I inquired about gluten free options the server immediately checked with the kitchen. They were able to provide me with gluten free toast, turkey bacon and delicious home fries. Yum! The atmosphere matched that of a lazy Sunday morning and we never felt rushed to leave by the staff, even though we were there for about an hour and a half. This is a great alternative if you don't feel like waiting at Petit D."}
{"text":"This was a great place for brunch on the Civic Holiday. I was there on Monday, August 1.    I was alone and seeing what sort of new place I might discover wandering down side streets. I was pleased to walk up the steps into this pleasant place.    The vegetables in my eggs were fresh. Everything was served hot. And the service was attentive. I will be remembering Mo Mo's."}
{"text":"My hubby and I really enjoyed this place. We live in the neighbourhood and so, have tried nearly every restaurant around. Some are great, and some...meh! Real Mo-Mo's felt warm, casual, and just a hint whimsical. The menu was filled with interesting items, and the prices completely reasonable (if dare I say, a tad underpriced...), but I'm not complaining.  High Tea - we didn't try, but dying to. And for $30 per 2 people (yeah, 2!!!), it seems like a steal. We ended up having the mussels (excellent, and the bread will make you swoon), and the chickpea and tomato soup (light, refreshing, maybe a tad citrusy for my taste), and an Americano. Nothing crazy, just strollin' by on a Friday afternoon. The coffee was really, really, good -- and I'm so happy about that!   Will be back to try their brunch, lunch, dinner, and high tea. So yeah, we've got some work to do..."}
{"text":"Delish place with yummy fish and chips and great vibe and music. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a rainy Sunday. It's a little out of the way but the trip was not for nothing.  The smoked salmon in the smoked salmon Benny was delicious. High quality and rich flavours were evident in the fish. The eggs were also very well poached. Unfortunately, these didn't come on an traditional English muffin.  The down under burgers were also pretty decent. They had a good flavour to them but it felt that they tried to do too much. They were small, and the kangaroo meet didn't add anything special - as did the toppings. Overall, they were good burgers but nothing special.   The atmosphere is nice and service was friendly! I'd be interested in trying out their high tea."}
{"text":"Downtown Saturday morning on a sunny day in May. Looking for a casual spot for brunch so of course checked Yelp. Only a short walk from the St Lawrence Market. Nice open, casual spot. About 30 tables. Great service. Reasonable prices with a nice selection. Eggs Benedict in a number of different selections, crepes, scrambled eggs..  The usual breakfast selection. Tea is loose leaf and served in a teapot with enough for two cups!  Ceasars and Mimosas top it off. Unhurried and attentive. Fun time. 80's tunes in the background. Don't you forget about me!"}
{"text":"I don't review often, but have to say that real no-mo's food was delicious! We did the prix-fixe menu, and chose 1) the vegetarian mo-mos (interesting take on the Tibetan dish) ; 2) nasi goreng with fried egg on top (was very yummy, not too salty, egg prepared perfectly on top) 3) chicken skewers with fries (my spouse said that the chicken skewers were deliciously moist and the fries were nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside); 4) a recommended sundae for one dessert and I had a traditional aussie date spice pudding with ice cream. For drinks we each started with \"Flaming Mo-Mo\" shooters (no relation to the Flaming Moe shooters of simpsons fame, although that came to our mind) a well prepared caipirinha and a glass of Riesling .  Our only issue defining \"what cuisine this restaurant served\"  was it Dutch-Indonesian? Australian? Tibetan? Some sort of remix? We talked to the manager and she said it's formulated from her world travels...ah we see now. But hey stop by it's a nice little book in the middle of downtown!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch with 3 friends and tried Real Mo-Mo's for the first time after reading reviews on Yelp. Considering it was a Sunday before noon, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately and not have to wait 15 minutes for a table.  Everything on the menu was reasonably priced and sounded delicious - I ended up choosing the ham, pineapple, and cheese pannenkoeken. The pannenkoeken is a Dutch style crepe which is more or less like a stuffed crepe. The crepe itself was very tasty but the portion wasn't big enough to fill me up. If I were to order it again, I'd get additional sides.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was good - would definitely visit again to try dinner and high tea!"}
{"text":"The Apple cinnamon crepe was an excellent breakfast dessert!  Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sliders for lunch and thought it average to taste. A little on pricey end for lunch. The ambiance and decor was nice and service was good. My friend also ordered a pasta and portion was small. At best I can only give average rating based on food and pricing."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious. The service was great and the food was delicious. Whoever made my salmon knows what he/she is doing.... it was juicing and tender but not undercooked. The Caesar was very delicious too."}
{"text":"After perusing yelp for brunch spots near our hotel in Toronto we came across the \"Real Mo-MO's\" which is located near St. Lawrence Market on a quiet side street. They don't take reservations but we were able to get a table for 4 on a Sunday around 12pm for brunch. The service is friendly and efficient and the food is delicious and well seasoned. I ordered the eggs your way and the rest of my family ordered crepes. All of our dishes were lovely, especially my eggs and home fries, so tasty. Their mimosa and coffee are also really good, coffee was nice and strong. I will definitely come back when I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Stopped here at around 2 pm for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. You get service with a smile here! We were warmly greeted upon arrival and seated promptly. I had the bison burger and it was delicious. Lovely, attentive ladies here. Thanks for the comfort food! Not a solid 5/5 because I reserve those for the supremely exceptional."}
{"text":"I went to Mo Mo's on a Tuesday afternoon for some afternoon tea service. It was pretty much empty when I arrived at 4:30. The restaurant had cute decor and the server was very sweet and took our order right away. We stuck with the black tea and I thought it was pretty average for tea. The treats that came with the tea service were lovingly displayed and explained by the server. I really enjoyed the salty salmon on croute and the mango curry served on top of a bun. The sweet treats were very average - a blueberry scone, a brownie and some biscuits. They were actually a bit sweet for my tastes. There was also a traditional Dutch snack served with a dip. Overall experience was good but if you are looking for something to blow you away, I would look elsewhere.   Pros -Great value - Attentive service  - Dutch flavours  Cons - Average desserts/tea - Seems a bit empty when you are the only table"}
{"text":"I don't understand the good review for this place. Dropped by for brunch on Sunday because it was so close to my place. Ordered cheese/mushroom pannenkoek (crepe) and fruit salad & scone. Food was very mediocre. Crepe was more like pancake cause it was fluffy and they just threw in whole mushroom and cheese in it. Nothing special. Fruit salad & scone was ... underwhelming. All of the fruit looked dry and old.... not very appetizing. It was quite tasteless. Scrambled eggs i ordered on side was dry, flat and disappointing as well. After food arrived, not one 'hows your food?' check in. Don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first high tea. Figured I had to try it since we were in Toronto. The meal was filling and satisfying. Nice variety of tasty sandwiches. Large variety of tea choices, I tried the chia tea. There were 3 of us and we each had a different tea and we were all satisfied. The sweets were a little different but good. We were served by Monique, the owner  I believe. Prior to going I emailed the shop with a question and the response was quick. I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner. Decor is very nice, clean and modern. Had the tofu and soba noodles which looked and tasted great. Shrimp skewers as a side were very tasty."}
{"text":"This location was previously a Thai restaurant and I was very happy to find out Real Mo-Mo's has taken it over. Brunch, lunch, dinner and high-tea menu is available at Real Mo-Mo's and we came for a brunch on a Sunday morning around 1pm. There was a good crowd and fortunately we did not have to wait long an got seated by the window.  Eggs The Way You Like Them ($10): Two eggs any style, your choice of turkey bacon, bacon, ham or spinach, served with multigrain toast & home fries - loved the toast, right amount of toasting with butter and not dry, but the highlight was the home fries! IT WAS GOOD. A lot of restaurants cannot handle simple food like bread and fries. Real Mo-Mo's nailed it. Asked the server and the home fries are first boiled and then fried. Crunchy and tasty!  Bison Burger ($16): If you like goat cheese, give it a try, nice combination of flavour.   Finally, wine choice: Good selections from everywhere (Australia, Cali, New Zealand, Italy) and I picked Chablis from Burgundy.  Definitely recommend this nice little brunch place!"}
{"text":"A beautiful space with lovely decor. Our server was very friendly but we did wait quite a long time for our mains to arrive. We shared the dumplings to start and for mains, I had the tofu and soba noodles with mushrooms on the side and my boyfriend had the lamb shank with baby potatoes. The dumplings were really good but we were both very disappointed in our mains. I found the wasabi completely overpowering and was only able to manage a few bites and he found the lamb shank to be very fatty."}
{"text":"Delicious meal at a place with a character!  If you are looking for  delicious meal with a great service and charming atmosphere - this is your place. Absolutely European classy approach - restaurant, cuisine and atmosphere. Mo (an owner) is an amazing host! Real food, real people!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Nothing wrong with service.  But the laminated menus and table smelled like it was wiped with a dirty cloth.  Also think I got a mild case of food poisoning....eggs seemed a little bit cold/odd"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch here and the place was pretty empty at the time. Cozy place with some interesting dishes. Service was good and venue was nice. I was not crazy over the Down Under Sliders I had but I had to give kangaroo a try. I would like to try some of the other things on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"I have a love for Dutch culture and this place is what I needed since I was not able to travel abroad this year. Brought two Dutch friends with me and we were just swooning over the pannekoeken and the desserts that we had.  Dutch pancakes are similar to crepes except that the items that you order are cooked into the crepe while it is on the pan.  Served with Dutch syrup which is not quite molasses and definitely not like maple syrup.  Service is attentive and the space is bright.  Am already planning out how I can return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered Real Mo-Mo's via Uber Eats a whim so this may have impacted the quality of the food. I ordered the tibetan dumplings and the nasi goreng.   The vegetarian tibetan dumplings were 4 for $12 - it is a tad pricy for what it was. It had a crispy shell with vegetable filling and a mango chutney drizzle. It was my first brush with tibetan cuisine so I wasn't sure to expect / had anything to compare it to. It was super yummy but it would have been better if it was eaten at the restaurant.  Now to the nasi goreng... I was unimpressed to say the least. After having nasi goreng in Malaysia and Indonesia, I was super stoked to finally find a place in Toronto. The ham came into huge bits and there was an eyelash in the egg.... Needless to say, it was a turn off from the start. There was also a huge taste of coconut curry - not sure why. It wasn't listed on their ingredients on Uber eats."}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre restaurant. The decor made me think it was gonna be dope. Not at all. The coffee was a half step up from gas station coffee. I ordered hearty scrambled eggs and the actual scrabble took up a small quarter of the plate.  They filled the rest up with potatoes and bread. My turkey bacon was somehow undercooked and cold at the same time. Good service though."}
{"text":"Real Mo-Mo's rocks!    A walk-up loft-style atmosphere created a relaxed comfortable vibe.   The food was tasty, interesting and delivered terrific value.  One might say they offer a 'healthy' slant to very satisfying food. My wife tried the cheese and mushroom Pannekoeken, while I had the bison burger.  The Pannekoeken was light and carried both sweet and savory elements with aplomb. The bison burger was surprisingly and impressively rich in flavor... as bison typically offers less flavor (i.e., less fat) than beef.    Being typical tourists, we were walking from the hockey HOF towards St. Lawrence Market and looking for a bite to eat... This was the perfect stop."}
{"text":"BRUNCH.  (weekends 9am-3pm)  Had the smoked salmon bennies with the home taters and Hollandaise sauce. It was honestly one of the better eggs bennies I have tried in Toronto. The egg was poached perfectly with perfect texture and runniness of the yolk.   The Hollandaise sauce was what I really enjoyed as it wasn't too \"citrusy\" and didn't overpower the overall flavour (which I find a lot of places unfortunately do. *cough eggpectations cough*)   The smoked salmon was fresh and of good quality and they didn't skimp on the portion either.   The highlight of the dish was equally shared amongst the egg, sauce and smoke salmon to create a trifecta of savoury greatness!   Service was also good. The waitresses all have perfect timing when it came to ordering, following up and the getting the bill.  Will definitely be coming back here to relive this moment again. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot in Toronto! Not because the food is unique or it's an exceptionally creative concept. Because it's not. But because of the atmosphere and reliable quality of food and service, that I've experienced dozens of times over the past year and a half.   I love that Mo serves you herself and that the team who works there is so consistent. As a regular, they always know my order and have coffee on my table as soon as I've sat down. They're chatty when you're looking for conversation but also seem to know when you're not up for chatting. I love supporting small businesses and it's so nice to get to interact with the owner on a regular basis.   The food is great! Love the home fries and bennies - I've tried a few of them over my various visits. The coffee is delish too!   A great spot for a relaxing morning for those staying in the area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We started our (late) first day off in Toronto with this restaurant, and am so incredibly glad we did. Being Dutch myself, I thought it was great when I stumbled upon a restaurant serving a lot of dutch dishes (kip satay, nasi, bitterballen, boterkoek, etc.) and they were all so good! My tilapia was good, too, and the lemony flavor of it was really nice :) The waitress that served us was so nice and seemed genuinely interested in knowing about us, which made the experience far more pleasant. And the food wasn't expensive at all! Will gladly be back if we're ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for high tea and thoroughly enjoyed myself! Delicious, filling food and a good selection of teas, not to mention the exceptionally friendly service and easygoing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go every Saturday morning for the best breakfast in town. I've had dinner too and the food and service is great. I hear hi tea is fabulous .  The best thing about Mo Mo's is Monique, the owner who makes sure everyone enjoys their meal. Try it. You'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"The Bison burger was overcooked, not as ordered and warm not hot. My friend's lamb shank was unexceptional. Overall much too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and great service! Super cute setting with plenty of seating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Brunch, Afternoon Tea, & Dinner served always so lovingly and caringly. The perfect place to relax with a family-like atmosphere and servers that treat you like first class butlers. Not to mention the food is superb.  Long overdue review, but since I feel like I'm always here it seems forgivable; this is my new favourite brunch to be! It's well hidden in a creepy alley when the sun's not high enough in the sky. So fret not and walk in!   The food ranges from classic bennies to bitterballen to crepes that can go the savoury route or the sweet one, all of which are my favourite. It'slike this place was soley created for my tastes!  You can create your own crêpes and though it may seem like a steep price (8+) for not a filling portion, the flavours is where it's worth. I highly RECOMMEND the Cheese & Mushroom Crêpe it's to die for and I've got all my friends hooked too.  The atmosphere is always so peaceful even through the Sunday morning brunch when the place is packed; like I said, it's like familys come around to be family again! Where do you get that those days in 2k17 huh?  Thank you for always having me and I love coming back!"}
{"text":"Honestly the ratings of this restaurant are confusing because this place is not that good. My boyfriend and I were here for brunch a couple of weeks back, denied a window seat (\"there are only two of you\") and sat watching the window seats that were not filled throughout our meal. God bless the Dutch, but their dispassionate customer service is totally off-putting (and they'll never realize here because Canadians are so polite they'll tip regardless). I ordered the scone, with cream and fruit compote; the scone came without either of the aforementioned items. When I asked if I could have some cream and compote, they said \"Oh... you wanted that?\" like it was some big surprise that I would want the dish I ordered. They returned 15 minutes later with a tablespoon of whipped cream and some jam. I was disappointed since scones without clotted cream seems like a travesty to someone with a British background. I truly thought that's what was coming with it because they serve high tea here, but I get that that's a pompous presumption. The rest of my breakfast was OK. Coffee is absolutely terrible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Taste homemade and waitress was very nice and attentive. Only thing is they don't serve breakfast or brunch during weekday breakfast"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Had a Saturday night dinner, appetizer, dinner, dessert... The dishes have very good flavours that are unique and shine through.  Everything is fresh, nice ingredients.  I tried the rib eye steak with the stuffed tomato and the ice cream with the espresso and Frangelico liquor for dessert (try this!!!).  Nice decor, good ambiance.. you can really tell this is a labour of love for the owner.  The portions are good sized, and reasonably priced.  There is a nice variety on the menu but not too much to make it confusing.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered Crispy Chicken Pannenkoek, meatballs and fruit and scone. The crepe was excellent. But the chicken was over and dry. There was not much meat inside the meatballs and the fruit wasn't fresh enough."}
{"text":"I came here for an excellent dinner with a friend.   My experience was fantastic right from the get-go: I made a reservation by email, which was replied to within a day. I asked about dairy-free options and Monique let me know that it wouldn't be a problem whatsoever. Once we got to the restaurant, the server (possibly Monique herself) let me know that they were going to keep the dairy allergy top of mind, and did so when we ordered our dishes.  I would describe the food here as Dutch Colonial, in that there were a lot of mainland Dutch/European items with a few colonial things, like Indonesian fried rice and their special of that day, Caribbean-style oxtail. A truly interesting concept for a restaurant. We both ordered the $37 prix fixe and split everything:  Bitterballen: fantastic! Deep fried goodness with a soft, somewhat gooey meat interior. They complemented the different mustards perfectly and were my favourite thing from dinner Fish cakes: quite good Nasi goreng: a very tasty take on fried rice that I haven't had before. Duck confit: very good, though I've had crispy duck confit before and I'm still kind of chasing that dragon. Dessert: I got the date... pudding? I can't remember exactly, but it was very good and not too sweet. It was great to have a non-dairy (well there's butter in it) dessert on the menu that wasn't a bowl of fruit.  The place itself is lovely, with a giant sunny window in the front. Service was super friendly and we felt welcome and taken care of the entire time. There will definitely be a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Great place. A mix of culture and delicious food with some vegan options. Just want to say that we came here on Easter Sunday.  Wasn't too busy. The owner's of the restaurant were actually serving us and were so hospitable. The menu is very diverse and the food was quite good. Check it out"}
{"text":"Great option for brunch/food near the Omni King Edward.  Friendly service and well executed brunch options.  Wife loved her dutch pancake with pineapple, ham, and cheese.  I had a veggie quiche with side salad and fries.  First time I have had a dutch pancake like this.  It had a nice chewy and doughy texture."}
{"text":"Wonderful new spot on new Colborne. Went in for Brunch this morning and had one of the best smoked Salmon Benny's ever! The home fries were cooked perfectly. My wife enjoyed a delicious Homemade Scone with fruit that actually tasted fresh versus canned. The staff was charming and friendly and the decor was very cool. Can't wait to come and try the lunch and dinner menus!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend. It was ok! I got the chai tea latte with almond milk and it was very cinnamon-y and quite sweet. Thankfully the staff were understanding and added more steamed milk for me to dilute the cinnamon flavour. I also got the Dutch style crepe with mushroom and white cheddar. This dish didn't stand out to me, but it tasted ok. I like the location of this restaurant, it feels very quaint and reminds me of Montreal a bit!"}
{"text":"Lovely high tea for 2 service (daily 3-5pm) at this new gem tucked away on Colborne. Opened by a Dutch owner, you can see influences in many of their offerings - high tea is no different.  Two layers of finger sandwiches (quartet of tzaziki and cucumber, mango chutney, smoked salmon and bitterballen - Dutch fried ball with meat ragu), accompanied by six desserts each (Nanaimo bar, brownie, butter tart square, scone, speculoos and stroopwafel - the latter two again Dutch specialties).  The best part? All of this plus unlimited loose leaf tea for two for 30!!! Coupled with lovely service, you have to try here! :)  Look forward to returning for cooked food soon."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. Cool atmosphere, super clean and great music.  Food tastes super fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Such a perfect little spot in downtown Toronto. By the time we started searching for a lunch spot, we were starving. Momo (the owner) actually heard us talking about going to this place on the street Agee blocks away and showed us the way :)  We got there just in time for high tea. The atmosphere is great. Intimate and friendly, a hidden treasure really, but it's still very close to everything.   The tea was perfect. Helped me rediscover my love for caramel rooibos. The high tea mini sandwiches and cookies were really nice. Original, well thought-out, just the right amount.   Next time I'm in Toronto, I'll make sure to stop by at least once! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! My friend and visit just happened to be in the neighbourhood before our appointment and decided to try this place out. The potatoes are SOOOOO good! Worth trying for sure!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that we chose to have brunch here...everything was amazing!  I started with my very first Caesar which is like a Bloody Mary but with Clamato juice and it was tasty!!! Oh and it came with a spicy pickle that was delectable...  I ordered the turkey bacon Benny because it is rare to have turkey bacon at a restaurant and it was better than I anticipated! The potatoes are cooked to perfection...crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, yum! The bread that the Benny is on is soft and tasty and not too much hollandaise sauce...  My husband ordered the Gerookte Zalm Ontbijt which was scrambled eggs and salmon with a homemade biscuit. The biscuit is amazing and we asked what the special ingredients were: thyme, oregano, roasted garlic and lots of of butter!!! Yum!!!  So many tasty options and the service was impeccable...two servers who were able to tag team the table effortlessly...it really was a fabulous experience and if I lived closer I would come back every weekend!!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 15 with a reservation. Was seated immediately and drinks orders were taken promptly.   The place is decorated fairly well and the restaurant has high ceilings. With our group seated hardly a few tables and spots were left for other customers.   All the lunch orders were taken. The food arrived for all fifteen of is about an hour later at which point many of us had to go back to office or were starving.   My order was Mushroom Pita with Fries. The pita was warm and delicious and mushrooms cooked perfectly with appropriate seasonings and a tad bit of spice. The fries seemed fresh cut and we're just the way I like it. They were fresh, warm and crispy on the outside and soft inside with a wee bit of salt.   Food was 5/5. Service not so, specially because we had booked the spots a couple day in advance. Would like to go there again, but wish they had more veggie options or the mo-mos were available for lunch as well."}
{"text":"Great place for weekend brunch.  Food is great and staff are friendly.  Small intimate feel but a few loud people can make the atmostphere a little loud -  but a good option none the less"}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch. Friends ordered bennies, whereas I opted for the Eggs The Way You Like Them with Bacon. We also opted to share the Pannenkoeken with apple and pineapple.    I thought the eggs and bacon were hit the spot. The Pannenkoeken with the apple was quite sweet but became a bit bland as we continued eating it. It might taste better with syrup. My friends thought that the bennies weren't runny enough.    Overall, the decor was quite modern with great music. We had great service as well. I'd come back to try the interesting lunch menu items."}
{"text":"The woman who runs the place is really friendly and the vibe of the place was decorated well as urban-cozy. The food is also high quality and comes out fast from the kitchen. It felt like I was eating at a friends house, if that friend knew how to cook well and liked to entertain. The coffee was good as well. I actually liked this place so much I came back twice during my trip."}
{"text":"It is a cozy space when you walk through the front doors. They had a private event going on later that afternoon so some tables were reserved.  Two of us ordered the Gerookte Zalm Ontbijt (Homemade savoury biscuit, smoked salmon, three scrambled eggs with Cheddar & home fries) and Crispy Chicken Pannenkoek (Crispy chicken tenders on a Dutch style crepe with fresh apple slaw, maple buttermilk ranch dressing and side of Dutch syrup). The first one came with only two eggs or less cause they added cream to the eggs. The taste was alright. Nothing too special. The second one was pretty good as the crepe tasted fresh and flavourful, together with the crispy chicken breast and unique Dutch Syrup was definitely the perfect pairing.  We were feeling quite content after the meal and left with satisfied taste buds and tummies!"}
{"text":"6/30/2017 We went to Mo Mos today for lunch, had the bitterballen, pannekoeken, sate and burgers. Service was very good (nice lady, we spoke Dutch) and the portions were adequate. We'll go again and will recommend it to my Dutch friends. Thanks Monique."}
{"text":"I came upon the Real Mo-Mo's after some research ahead of my trip to Toronto and I was impressed. If you like Dutch food, this should already be on your list. If not, I still recommend it, especially the brunch.  It's on a side street so don't take the wrong turn. The space is open and welcoming. Mo works front of house and she's great.  What sold me the most was the food, mainly the bennies. I enjoyed the Turkey Benny (which was turkey bacon) and it's everything you want from a benedict. A perfect ratio of bread to egg and tons of fresh tomato. The best part was the poached egg and I don't say this often, but they were some of the best eggs I've had. Whatever kind of eggs they use, they are spot on. They also have gluten-free bread for those that need it. Oh, and can't go wrong with the home fries."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a \"spontaneous\" (read: last minute) anniversary dinner and felt that the experience was just A-Ok with stars lost mainly for poor value... But disclaimer: I am a broke ass student. The food is, as always, perfectly flavored and well presented (except dessert).   We both ordered from the 3-course prix fixe menu and I thought $37/person was pretty steep for the portion sizes we received. Probably way better off, financially, ordering off the regular menu, especially if you are vegetarian/vegan! The prix fixe menu would be great for meat eaters though since there are so many options with animal protein - one of the upsides of the prix fixe menu is how many options you are given, almost like ordering from the regular menu, but just sucks a lot for vegans since there is currently NO vegan dessert option besides leftover mixed fruit from brunch :'(  Highlight was the vegetable momo appetizer! It can be veganized. OMG it was served warm with mango chutney (with actual mango chunks!) and balsamic(?) drizzle and had sooo much flavor! The puffed pastry was so soft yet slightly crispy, just perfection. The feta date salad appetizer was so-so. The portion was very small and was very plain - would not order this again.  There are 2 vegan/vegetarian mains at Real Momo's - a quinoa tabbouleh (highly recommended if you have a bigger appetite) and a grilled tofu soba noodle. We both ordered the soba noodle and no regrets :) There was actually a lot of tofu in this dish, so yes you do feel full by the end, but overall the portion size was pretty slender. I asked the owner about the sauce they used and it's a blend of a special sweetened/mildly spicy soy sauce, maple syrup, and mayonnaise (not sure if I heard correctly since this is supposed to be vegan?). I would've preferred the soba to be cooked more al dente if that's a thing because I thought it was too mushy and lost its texture.  Dessert was sad times for me with a small bowl of leftover mixed fruit. The ice cream sundae my partner ordered was also sad - big portion, but sad presentation. Sad sad sad.  Will be back, obviously, but maybe after they introduce more vegan/veg options."}
{"text":"Went here for a surprise party. They did a great job tailoring the event to our needs with a custom menu and dessert. The food was excellent and so was the service. Will definitely be back for brunch or dinner. The duck was great!!"}
{"text":"I went to Real Mo-Mo's for a company dinner. We ordered an assortment of different appetizers and as my entree, I ordered the steak with a side of the brussels sprouts.  I have to say, I was disappointed with my meal. The steak was unacceptably overcooked (I asked for medium rare but I received something in between medium well and well done). To top it off, I didn't receive a separate steak knife to cut through this tough meat. I had to make do with the standard cutlery. Honestly, the brussels sprouts were awesome, but the steak left a bad taste in my mouth. The appetizers were just fine but nothing to write home about.  Aside from that, my dining experience was relatively pleasant. The waitress was attentive and the restaurant is tastefully decorated. I can see why my company decided to host our dinner at this venue."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We had a party of 4 and the service was personable and charming.  Nice menu, and we had the bison burger, skewers, lamb and salad. We all loved our food. Great location and it's away from the tourist from the Market. It's really a hidden gem with great value."}
{"text":"I was here because nothing else was open around me on a saturday morning. I had slightly higher expectations, especially with the $3.5 orange juice, which seemed like it was from concentrate because of the extremely bitter aftertaste and it had no pulp. That really overshadowed anything that I ordered and the food, was alright. I can see their goal and their attempt, but it fell short of my expectations. There's quite a few great brunch places around, unfortunately, I don't feel like the food was up to par with the service as it was being quite exemplary.  Service: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 3/5  Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Great simple breakfast place, if your a fan of Dutch food you need to go. We made a video from the visit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDm0FnhsSXM"}
{"text":"Great brunch food in a cute restaurant with high ceilings and fancy chandeliers.   We came here as a party of three to celebrate mother's day on a Sunday. Surprisingly, around noon, there was hardly anybody in the restaurant - although that might of just been an off weekend.  Gerookte Zalm Ont bit (16) - the portions are great and the food is flavorful! It really hits the spot if you're looking a cure from a hangover.   Smoked Salmon Benny (16) - I found this to be meh. It was your typical Benny with smoked salmon, nothing tasted really amazing about this one.   Classic Quiche (12) - I found this to be a very small portion with a side salad. Although the quiche was good, I was still quite hungry after and ended up finishing my mom's food.   Ambiance: Very open concept which I loved! There are a lot of tall windows, so being sat next to them on a sunny day made the entire experience better.   Service: We were sat promptly as we came in a service at a timely manner. Our server was great and the food came out quite quick as well. It might of had to do with because we were the only ones in the restaurant, but hey still good service to me!   If I had to come back here again, I would recommend going for the more unique items, instead of your regular Benny."}
{"text":"We sought refuge here during a cold night in downtown Toronto; the helpful staff found a table for us despite no reservation.  The atmosphere is very casual, with exposed red brick walls and high ceilings.  A small bar is located in the back corner, and a flatscreen TV is hung curiously out of view of the bar.  The menu is eclectic.  Kangaroo sliders, Tibetan Dumplings and Bitterballen- a Dutch meatball appetizer are among the choices to start.  We split the Tibetan dumplings and Bitterballen and were impressed by each.  The dumplings came with a gorgeous ginger chutney.  The Bitterballen isn't your typical meatball, in the center  is soft and almost creamy.  My wife had the grilled tofu and soba noodles, which she loved, but found the sundried tomatoes too chewy.  I had the Kip Satay- the chicken plump and cooked perfectly, the peanut sauce as expected, but the fresh cut fries (the only way to cook a French Fry...) were disappointingly undercooked.  Nice wine list, and very efficient and friendly wait staff.  We would return for sure."}
{"text":"Tucked away on an unobtrusive side street, it's easy to walk by without noticing this small restaurant. I was here for a weekday dinner and walked into a mostly empty space. There was only one table finishing off afternoon tea. It later picked up with a couple more tables and a large group of coworkers came in for a work function. Otherwise a relatively quiet place for a meal.  The dinner menu options provide a wide choice to select from, but I found that they are generally small portions. I picked the mussels with a side of zucchini fries, and it came piled high in a bowl but mostly due to shell volume. Each held only a small bite of meat, but thankfully there were no empty shells. The three triangular pieces of toast served on top was somehow burnt black on one side but still soft on the other, not my favorite part of the dish. The side dish of 10-some pieces of zucchini fries did little to fill me up, although they were well crusted and fried to a golden color. My dinner companion had the chicken skewers. He said they were good, but it looked like an appetizer sized dish than a dinner meal. Generally the food was well made, just that the portions are small for dinner portions and prices. Maybe this place is meant to be more of a brunch option instead?"}
{"text":"Went for a work luncheon with within a group of 7. Super friendly staff and a lovely menu.   Everyone was super happy with their orders. Myself I had the lamb pita and it was amazing - I plan to return for this as well want to try the tea service."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise with a good price tag. We got an amuse bouche of a cheese pouf type mouthful!  We came for dinner on a sunday when they have thier fish and chips and a pint special for $18 (this is such a good deal!) The fish is lightly battered and fried and still moist and flavourful. The fries are crispy and plentiful and the beer is cold. I ordered the daily salmon with a side of veggies. It was good, but not piping hot; everything was well seasoned and good though.   I'd definitely come back for the fish and chips special!"}
{"text":"Monique is one of the most attentive and committed restaurant owners in Toronto. The service is always top drawer and the food is always fresh and delicious. Reliable with nice originality. Neither my guests nor myself have ever been disappointed. Not even once."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Searching for a brunch place close to our hotel and we weren't disappointed by Real Mo-Mo's at all. Knock out was the pannenkoeken, which my usually picky four-year-old devoured. My ham benny was delicious and the potatoes were exactly the right ratio of crunchy to soft. Service was also great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, location and service !!! This was the last breakfast of the trip and I wish it had been the first so I could come back ! The veggy Benny was delish!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a place. Inventive menu, nice cocktails, beer and wine.  Phylo Quebec Brie was as tasty and good as it looked.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday morning hoping for a great experience before the Raptors game. Unfortunately for us, our high expectations weren't met. The deep fryer was apparently broken. I get it, it happens. But for a server to keep on commenting that it's too early and it's a Sunday so they don't have control on when the person who would fix the fryer would come, it's a little bit annoying. For a restaurant that specializes on breakfast/brunch on the weekend, maybe get 2 deep fryers.  But that's not the worst of it. Since the fryer is broken, half of the menu is off. My wife politely asked if it's possible to order something from the lunch menu. The answer from the server was, \"No, it's a different menu.\" She didn't even asked what it was that my wife wanted to order and maybe at least pretend to ask the chef at the back. Well, my wife wanted to order a slider. Might not be available, right? But there is a bloody Bison Burger on the breakfast/brunch menu that my son ordered!   Food is ok, eggs are a little dry and vegetable salad were not fresh. The bread I got was nice, though.  We were so disappointed but it's our fault for having high expectations based on Yelp reviews. Lesson learned, I guess.  Definitely not coming back. Good luck to everyone else, hope you get a better experience than us."}
{"text":"Intrigued by the Dutch touches to the menu, my wife and I went to try this new spot tonight. We were not disappointed! The food was great and authentic, the restaurant looks great, and the owner Monique is friendly, very attentive and hard-working! We came in with our baby in an unwieldy stroller, but there was more than enough space and we were never made to feel unwelcome (some other restaurants are not so accommodating!). We'll definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"I thought it was a new resto but they've been here 2 years. I had lunch here with 2 colleagues ... they have an interesting menu.  The chicken with cheese toasted sandwich is a large portion, very tasty, and the fries are amazing. My dining mates had the quiche and said it was delish. For their side they chose the half salad/half fries which is $1 more. The menu says frites - I think of these as skinny fries, they serve chunky home made fries and they are perfectly crispy and salted.  Our meals with tax were about $20 each, we did not have anything to drink (just tap water and 2 coffees).  They have a brunch menu on the weekend, they serve afternoon tea, and have  a really interesting drinks menu."}
{"text":"I loved the ambience, the food and the cocktails at the Real Mo-Mo! I got the scramble with cheddar and I finished every last bite. I also got the mo-mo-jito which was delicious - not too sweet and the fresh strawberries and mint were the highlight. It was just around the corner from Toronto's flatiron building, which made for a nice walk, even on a cold day. Definitely brunch here next time you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with some old, long lost friends. We had a very pleasant experience. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. There seems to be a Dutch influence of the menu. The food was tasty, filling, and reasonably priced. It is easy to miss on the street so keep your eyes out. I'd for sure come here again."}
{"text":"Good quality food, good service, good prices. Had the chicken sandwich and with half fries and half salad and it was great. I'm interested in going back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious benny! Around $11 for the turkey bacon benny and $14 for the smoked salmon benny. I would recommend the salmon if you had to try one - not the turkey bacon as it's too oily for my personally.   The hash browns were made well, fresh and flavourfully seasoned.   One recommendation was the we wished they included some spinach or some sort of greens inside the benny. Also, they only offered 2 small pieces of fruits on the dish - a little weird, might as well not include it?   Overall though, we had a good time here, the service was decent."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Sunday morning for brunch after staying overnight in Toronto. Food was excellent. Service was good. I would go back again. Gluten free toast available and they let me substitute salad for fried potatoes (not gf). I was disappointed with the turkey bacon. It was chewy, not crispy."}
{"text":"Kind of a hidden spot in the downtown core, albeit a 10min walk away from the madness - but that means it's not too crowded or noisy during lunch.   Got the meatballs for an app, which was pretty good, but you definitely need to dip it in one of the sauces. Otherwise it's a little bland. Followed up with the kangaroo sliders (a little bit tiny!!) and because kangaroo meat is naturally so lean, they had to use a lot of extra sauce to give it flavour considering the meat itself is on the tasteless side. The great thing is that you don't feel oily or greasy after having this, but I definitely was not fully satisfied because the portion was tiny."}
{"text":"What a lovely place to eat! Was staying at the King Edward and needed some breakfast. Lucky me they had just opened and I was fortunate enough to chat with the owner. Such a delightful person. Heading back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ended up here for brunch because my first choice was closed and my second choice had a line out the door. This seemed good enough, but it was more than just good enough.  In the end, I'm happy we ended up here. Getting the same brunch classics feels a little boring, so it was fun to have some options that are uniquely Dutch. The food was delicious and fun and overall it was a great experience.  Stop spending your Saturday morning in a queue for the same old eggs benny and come here instead."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is a gem, all thanks to owner Monique! Located near the St. Lawrence Market and King Edward Hotel, this is the perfect spot for brunch,  lunch and dinner... and high tea! As an industry professional myself, I appreciated the warm and inviting decor as well as the innovative menu presentation.  The icing on the cake for me today was when I left an important package behind... and Monique had it ready and waiting for me when I returned hours later. This is definitely an owner who cares, and someone I'd love to see succeed in this competitive market. Check it out!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the high tea (haven't tried anything else here)  High tea was okay.. my favourite would be the chicken salad on apricot(?) jam little sandwich thing. Smoked salmon was decent too. And the nutella brownies were delicious. Everything else was just ok/good-ish. It was def worth it for the price though! Only $35 for two people and you each get your own pot of tea. Don't think I've seen high tea anywhere cheaper than this."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here.  First a taste of their  black bean and quinoa falafel.  Then one of us had the satay, really moist chicken, and fries.  It was delicious.  The other had their bison burger with fried zucchini spears and a light creamy ranch dressing.  Another delicious meal.  Finally the date pudding with ice cream ended the meal on a sweet note.  Our server and the manager made us feel at home.  The service was excellent and the meal with dessert under $50."}
{"text":"tldr: Social staff and repeat clientele. Food is above average for a brunch place. Mussels are to-die-for.  The Real Mo-Mo's is a great brunch/lunch/dinner shop with great drinks and mussels. Let's focus on the mussels. The mussels are in a nice tart broth. The broth does not overpower the mussels. Combine that with the fries and you get a meal comparable to the best mussels places in Belgium (OG home of mussel pots)."}
{"text":"Went here after a class at goodlife. We were sat right away, the waitress was really friendly.  The mo-mosas hit the spot.  For apps we had the bitterballen (which I have been craving since my last trip to Amsterdam) not the best I have but so so good. We also had the Brie, that was really tasty, the chutneys on the side were awesome.   For dinner we all had the burger, it was a little too packed for my liking. I also wasn't a fan of the literal mound of goat cheese.   I will for sure go back. The food is good, I just think we got the wrong main dish."}
{"text":"Out of the way and unexpectedly amazing.  Portions were very fair for price and quality was over the top.  Staff were super friendly and timely.   Very clean also.   Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried to get a reso at a number of places but everything was booked bc of the holidays. I kept meaning to try Real Mo-Mo's for brunch but figured it was a great chance to try their dinner menu! Definitely a more quiet dinner atmosphere. That said, the baked brie was delicious and we had a great time! Also, very affordable for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, very nice atmosphere! Definitely everyone should try this restaurant! Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad is delicious!"}
