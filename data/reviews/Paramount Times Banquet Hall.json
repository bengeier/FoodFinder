{"text":"Not impressed. My mom and I came to try this place out, as it is new. They put us at a small table even though there were plenty of 4 person tables that were empty.  Everyone else who consisted of 2 people who came after were given the larger tables. This table is so small there's hardly any room after the teapot and our dishes.

We ordered our dim sum dishes, which has taken about 20 minutes for even one dish (spring rolls) to show up, ridiculously slow for a Chinese place.  Since they forgot to order one of our dishes, I tried to wave them down, to no avail.  They paid attention only to larger groups. 

Like many places, this is really a middle class restaurant trying to be high end.  Food is good, but I can get the same elsewhere for cheaper and much better service.  Nearby Premiere is much better for the same prices.  For the same food but cheaper, go to the hotpot place (forgot the name, sorry) in the corner of the same plaza.  

For reference, prices are:
S - $2.90
M - $3.90
L - $4.90
XL - $5.90
SP - $6.90
J - $8.90
S, M, and L are $3.00 between 9am and 11:30am"}
{"text":"Do Not come here!! The service is so poor. The food is so so. Not great. When this place first opened the manager then was pretty nice and food was better then too. This time I went back there are new managers there and there are very little customers. We went during peak time around 12:30 for dim sum. Anyways the reason why I don't recommend is that one of the managers sat down to talk to us and he stuck a pen inside his ear and started picking the inside of his ear and then flicked it on the floor. I looked at my family and quickly ended the conversation and left. It was disgusting and not professional at all. His shirt was suppose to be white but instead it was surrounded in black and grey dirt round his wrist and collar. The place was pretty much empty and food was not great and service needless to say was atrocious. Any wonder the place is so empty."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a $100 groupon, and the food was great! Menu is diverse with a lot of choice. The best dish of the night was a steamed rice in lotus leaf and Vancouver crab! It was really tasty and the crab was so fresh!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Will definitely go back for this. The other dishes of the night were good as well, including stewed lamb hot pot. We saw a lot of tables ordering the Peking duck and their BBQ meats looked quite good too, although we didn't try them this time. The service and setting was nice too! Regular prices are a little higher than average (by~$5/dish).

We came back a few weeks later for dim sum and was happy with the food too. Really good deal for $3 per dish! I was surprised at some of the negative reviews here coz I found their shrimp and meats to be good quality. Serving size is also reasonable. A few people at my table ordered from their HK style cafe menu instead (you can have both dim sum and cafe food at the same time!) and they were happy with the steak as well. My mom especially liked their HK style milk tea, which we were told is one of their specialties.

Hope to come back and try another dinner or banquet style dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Rip off. We ordered a 4.5 pound lobster and received a lobster with 7 pieces of edible meat and one claw. The skinned duck was more like a 4 month old duck. Do I even need to say anything more? But $95 special right?"}
{"text":"We decided to try out this new restaurant because of the coupon. 
The quality does not worth the money. I consider it very expensive for the price they charge per dish.
The dining room is not that clean, with an atmosphere like eating at a HKness canteen. 
The service was good, although the servers were talking loudly at the counter when we were eating. 
Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Chinese Restaurant/Banquet Hall

Went for Dim Sum... I would say it is average compared to other dim sum places.

Fried Pork/Veggie Buns served in a Pot -  Fresh, Yummy and not oily.  Nice Presentation.
Pork&Chinese Chives Dumplings - good balance between pork and chinese chives, fresh, tastes good
Enoki Mushroom & Dried Conpoy Sprout Dumplings - good
Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll - they make good noodle roll
Chinese Mushroom & Chicken Rice - good portion, average quality
Shredded Port & Preserved Egg Congee - good portion, i actually like this because it's not too salty, not as good as the congee specialty restaurants but above average for a dim sum place
Double boiled Steamed Milk - one of my favorite desserts, good, not too sweet

Morning Dim Sum - S/M/L $3.00 if ordered before 11:30am for mon-fri and before 10:30 for sat/sun/holidays.  There is line-up for morning dim sum, so it's better if you can arrive before 10:30am to avoid any line-ups.

Decor - nice, bright and clean.  Windows all around =)"}

Just had dinner at this place and I'd have to concur with the other diners who've said, \"Avoid this place. Very slow and poor service attitude\"  and \"Not impressed\".  These diners were right on the mark, including \" they forgot  to order one of our dishes\"!

Ordered the special set menu.  Dishes took long to arrive and arrived at irregular intervals. Since this was a celebratory dinner, I made it a point to call ahead for a special dessert and reminded them of my request when I arrived.  Lo and behold, when it was time for dessert, they had forgotten!  It was supposed to be a surprise so I had to act discreetly.  When I followed-up with the Captain/Manager I had talked to earlier, he wouldn't even acknowledge that he had forgotten but claimed it was on it's way.  The cheque arrived and people where ready to leave so again, I had to check with the Captain.  By this time, he starting having an attitude as if it was becoming a nuisance to make his customers happy and make amends for his error -he even walked off rather than make any attempt to apologize.

Word to the Wise, a \"fancy\" restaurant means more than just charging a premium for food and having nice d√©cor -it's about service and attention to detail which in my experience, this establishment sorely lacks.  Don't take the chance of hosting any special occasions here.  

The reviews for this restaurant don't bode well -they'll probably just re-open under a new banner leading potential diners to believe it's a different place under new management."}
{"text":"Came for dim sum for Chinese New Year...Food was pretty good, came out fast and hot. The food was traditional but yet modern atmosphere which is  nice to see in our area. Would definitely come back again! Little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"It's a pity. The food here is excellent. 

However, within the last week I was here for both a banquet and Dim Sum. The service is disinterested at best, unorganized and rude at worse. 

My relatives reserved two tables of banquet for a 90th birthday banquet. While we were given a private room, and food started to arrive quickly, the pace of service quickly slowed to non- existence, to a point where after our soup course, the rest of the four courses took another two hours to arrive. Being a party that not only have the elderly as well as very young children, I felt that we were forgotten over a larger party next door.  It was hard to get our service person even for something as simple as a fork for the children, much less a bowl of rice for one of the kids and a glass of tap water. 

By the time our rice dishes arrived at the end of the meal, we had already cut the cake because it was getting to a point where the elderly had to go home and the yonger kids were asleep or cranky. 

I returned for dim sum earlier today, and we had been waiting for about 40 minutes for our dim sum, and was greeted by an irate \"captain\" rather rudely when we enquired after our order. It was evident to is that the front if house is extremely disorganized. 

As I have said though- it's a shame. The food itself here is throughly excellent when it arrived, which is why this restaurant receives one star from me.  I want to come back, but really not until the service improves."}
{"text":"I came for a formal banquet. 

The services was excellent and professional.  The private room was spacious for our 2 large tables.  We were assigned one dedicated waiter whole evening, with more servers coming in to serve new food, remove plates of finished food and to replace dirty plates.  All the servers were polite and quick this evening.  The chief operating officer came by mid evening to check on progress and to socialize.

The food was delicious. The ingredients were exceptionally fresh. Paramount mainly serves modified traditional Chinese food that is much less oily yet still flavorful, presented in beautiful plating.

I don't know the pricing, but I suspect it is not cheap.  Paramount knows how to serve a banquet well, though. The premise is presentable, and the restaurant location is convenient for people living uptown."}
{"text":"We came here not knowing what to expect, so we gave it a try. We thought it was $3 a plate but ended up 4.20, which was overpriced and the food was just meh. 30 bucks down and I'm still hungry..."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  Very slow and poor service attitude. We ordered a dish that turned out completely different than both the Chinese and English description in the menu.  We offered a gentle comment to them that they should be more clear with their menu description and I was very clear that we are not asking for a refund or credit or anything.  Yet the captain took it as great offense and gave us poor attitude for the rest of the lunch. 

Service in general was also very slow.  They just don't have enough serving staff there."}
{"text":"I am kind of glad that I tried out Paramount Times Banquet Hall during their Early Bird Special ($3 for S/M/L)! I would have been so upset at myself if I had paid full price for a large dim sum at $4.90 per order!

The banquet hall itself is really nice. Staff is readily available and really friendly too!

But why was my table wobbling like crazy?! I almost split my food a few time! This place suppose to be a high end banquet hall charging premium for dishes and using tables that are falling apart? Fancy tablecloth is not helping!

Food wise were a miss more than a hit! The kitchen really needs to get a better source for the ingredients they use! Shrimps were terrible and have a funny texture!

Fresh Stuffed Bean Curd Rolls (M) - one of the better dish 

Snow Pea Sprout & Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll (L) - shrimps were meh but the wrappings were good!

Chicken Feet & Pork  Ribs Rice (L) - A OK!

Ginseng Soup Shrimp Dumplings (L) - The skin was so thick and chewy, shrimp were meh and ginseng not helping the taste at all!

Pan Fried Chinese Chive Dumpling (M) - more like deep fried? The filling was kind of tasteless and the crust was not good

Pork Dumplings with Fish Roe (M) - Overcooked? The saddest Siu Mai I ever seen... those baby little shrimps and where's the fish roe? 

Sticky Rice Dumplings with Sesame Paste Custard (M) - the filling has this awfully oily instead of custardy!

Most of the dim sum were not properly prepared.  Even the basic ones Siu Mai and Har Gow were not even as good as some of those $2.00 all sizes dim sum place! Maybe the kitchen will make some adjustment since the business is relatively new.

{"text":"Disclaimer: I've avoided making a Yelp account to review restaurants, but my first dining experience here was so unforgivable that I gave in and made an account.  This review is majority focused on the customer service that I faced on 2015/03/08.  The \"2\" rating that I give is the average of a 1-star rating for customer service, and a 3-star rating for the actual food.

So on to the review.

On 2015/03/08, I went to this restaurant to eat Dim Sum with a big group of relatives (12 people).  My aunt had chosen this restaurant (as she is a regular), but it was my first time.  Here is a timeline of events that transpired on that day:

12:30pm: We put in our order.

01:00 pm (30 minutes after order): We ask a waiter (for the first time) to check up on our food, as not a single plate had arrived.  They said their systems had been down for a while, so they could not put the order in.

Question 1: Why would your staff not notify the customers of the delay?
Question 2: Is your staff so reliant on technology these days that you cannot manually forward an order to the kitchen when the system is down?

01:15pm (45 minutes after order): Apparently the systems are back up.  A waiter/waitress returns with an electronic printout of our items for tracking purposes.

01:30pm (1 hour after order): We ask a waiter/waitress to check up on our order again (second time). They tell us not to worry, as it should be coming now that the system is up.

01:45pm (1 hour and 15 minutes after order): We ask another waiter/waitress to check up on our order (third time).  They walk away momentarily (I'm assuming they went to \"check\" for us), and return with the same reply that the food should be coming.

02:00pm (1 hour and 30 minutes after order): We ask another waiter/waitress to check up on our order (fourth time), making clear that we have now been waiting for over 1.5 hours (or perhaps some will count it as 45 minutes from the time the system came back up).  At this point, some tables around us (that only sat down at around 15 minutes ago) have their food.  I am usually a patient person, but perhaps 1.5 hours is my limit, so I get up to put on my jacket, hinting that perhaps we should leave.  Unfortunately for me, my relatives are super laid back, and as mentioned before, my aunt is a regular, so they decide to continue waiting.

02:15pm (1 hour and 45 minutes after order): At this point, my relatives have also had it with the waiting.  We all get up to leave, and my aunt signals to one of the waitresses to cancel our order.  Perhaps now that things have actually gotten serious (in a sense that they were going to lose $200+ revenue), they finally do a thorough check up (fifth time) on our order and tell us that the order was just put in not too long ago, as they had completely missed it (even though we got the electronic printout a while back).

Question 3: What the hell did your staff do the first few times they checked up?  Were they so incompetent that they could not trace through a few stages of order processing to see what point our order was at?

02:16pm (1 hour and 46 minutes after order): Our food starts to arrive.  One of the staff offers a complimentary shrimp fried rice for our inconvenience.  Out of respect for my aunt, we stay for the meal.

Question 4: Shrimp fried rice? Seriously?  Any reputable restaurant with good customer service would have probably offered the meal for free (or at a significant discount) at the 1 hour mark.  However, even if the meal was free, I would not be satisfied - taking the old saying that \"time is money\", even if all 12 people were making minimum wage (and I don't mean Asian \"under the table\" minimum wage, I mean Ontario 2015 minimum wage of $11/hr), we'd still be at a net loss for our collective time wasted.

Conclusion: With everything that has been said above, I must make clear that the food is not bad, but food is not the only factor when it comes to rating a restaurant.  The customer service provided by the staff is equally important, and the waiters/waitresses that we encountered that day were clearly incompetent.  With so many food choices around the Richmond Hill area, I see no reason to return here ever again."}
