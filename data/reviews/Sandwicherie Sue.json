{"text":"Super duper delicious and original (yet authentic!) bahn mis. Stuffed to the brim with delicious marinated meats, and veggie options too! Available either on really really good (I'm assuming homemade) dense yet light baguette or in a spring roll. Really cute but very small, probably easier for take-out. A few seats at a bar are available but it's quite tiny, which gives it plenty of charm. Super friendly service. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very suprised at their different kind of banh mi. I had the traditional banh mi and their \"porc'chop\" banh mi and I must say they are super tasty. My favorite is the porc'chop one! The staffs there are super friendly and welcoming. I would recommend others to try this place out! It also sorta remind me of the resto \"banh mi boys\" located in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not sure what the whole rave is all about for this place. I dropped by here today to check exactly that. I asked the girl at the counter what their most popular sandwich is and she said the pork chop so ordered that. 

Hard on teeth bread, few of the pork strips with fat not properly trimmed, not spicy enough for me even after asking for their spicy mayo so had to add Sriracha sauce to get some party going on in my mouth. In general, an OK, messy and hard to manage to eat sandwich and really nothing special to deserve a 5 star. Also, as the other reviewers mentioned, it's a small joint so don't look forward for anything much here besides quickly filling your stomach and then go about your business. 

Wasn't impressed or may be Vietnamese sandwich is not my thing. If this is their best seller, I think I'll pass on the rest on the menu. In conclusion: What.Ever."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs sandwich du genre EVER. Mon coup de coeur: le porc char tsiu aux 5 épices. OMG. Portion généreuse de viande, pain moelleux à l'intérieur et croustillant à l'extérieur. Légumes marinés délicieusement frais et croquant... vraiment un excellent Banh mi (désolé si j'ai sérieusement mal écrit les termes vietnamiens...) bref c'est suuuuper Bon!"}
{"text":"Out of this world! Try the lemongrass pork chop banh mi, you'll thank me later. Prices are decent and the filling was very generous, tender and tasty. Looking forward to going back and trying other items on the menu. They have a good selection of sandwiches (with 3 vegetarian options, all of which seemed interesting), salads and spring rolls. They also serve bubble tea drinks in many flavours, as well as lemonade.

The staff was friendly and polite and the place was welcoming altogether. Sit at the counter or order for takeout - I believe they also deliver. Definitely a good neighbourhood joint."}
{"text":"C'est un petit comptoir de sandwich et de rouleaux printemps pour emporter, manger sur place ou se faire livrer.

J'ai pris un sandwich au porc char-siu et des rouleaux de printemps shitake. Le sandwich n'est pas un pain traditionnel banh mi, mais le tout nous rappelle le goût du banh mi avec les carottes, le daikon mariné et le concombre. Le sandwich n'est pas long, mais il a une bonne largeur et est bien rempli de viandes. 

Le rouleau de printemps était décevant. Il semblait avoir l'équivalent d'un champignon tranché avec un peu de salade et rempli de vermicelles. 

Le menu est original et abordable. Les autres items sur le menu seront à essayer, mais sous format sandwich."}
{"text":"Meilleur bubble tea (litchi) que j'ai goûté! Lorsque j'ai changé de quartier l'an passé, ça m'a fait un petit plis au cur de ne plus avoir ce resto à proximité!"}
{"text":"Un seul mot; Auberchine. Jamais de ma vie je n'ai goûté un sandwich aussi délicieux.
J'ai aussi essayé le boeuf sud est et le porc chop... c'était bon mais rien à voir avec celui garni d'aubergines. Le concept est sandwich et rouleaux de printemps vietnamien mais le chef propriétaire est Peruvien ce qui ajoute encore plus de saveurs et de créativité dans le menu.
Bref à essayer sans faite dans ta vie"}
{"text":"I'm in love with these sandwiches! Dropped by once when I was in the area and tried their Poulet Tresor Bahn Mi and it was fantastic. The roll is the perfect mix of crunchy on the inside and soft on the inside. The Bahn Mi was stuffed with high quality goods and it's a fantastic lunch option. I was in and out in 5 minutes!

The location is relatively small, so it's basically take and go. They do have about 8 seats or so but this place is not intended to be a hang-out.

I enjoyed it so much I even catered it for my work's monthly social activity and Sandwicherie Sue went above and beyond. They have an outstanding catering options. We went with 15 sandwiches and 15 spring rolls. They were perfectly prepared and organized. They came in neat large circular containers and nothing was omitted. It was a huge office hit. They know what they're doing and they even deliver! Will do it again in a few months."}
{"text":"Decided to venture away from my usual nooks for lunch one day and fell upon this restaurant mostly due to the other yelp reviews. Although a little out of the way but boy, am I glad decided to take the trip!

Firstly, the space is small with a row of seating against the three walls with the kitchen in the back of the shop. Besides the typical kitschy decor, the counter style seating with dark highchairs makes great use of the space. 

The menu is divided as either sandwich or rolls, and you choose the filling; I opted for the traditional bahn mi sandwich with a cold Vietnamese coffee. The sandwich was just outstanding! I loved everything about it; the meat, the thin slice of pate, the marinated vegetables and abundant coriander were just perfection in every bite! The bread was soft, chewy and fresh too. My coffee was delish too; nicely prepared, and perfectly cold. I downed that baby fast!

I am going back to try everything on the menu, and so should you!"}
{"text":"Banh mis are trendy now. Nonetheless, Sue's became an instant favorite. The bread is perfectly warm and crunchy. The meat is thick, so good that you can feel the goodness in your mouth. The spring rolls are made with grilled meat on the spot, yummy! The owners and staffs are very friendly."}
{"text":"Belle petite place. environ 6-7 mètres carré. C'est pas grand. C'est définitivement une place pour emporter. C'est à deux pas du Parc Molson et t'as plusieurs parcs sympa dans le coin.Le service est rapide. Le menu offrent Sandwich ou rouleau de printemps avec leurs sauce maison qui est très bonne. Boeuf, Poulet, Porc, Végé.  5-6 types de sandwichs. Au niveau boissons, ils offrents des Bubble Tea, Limonades/Jus maison et autres. Le sandwich est très bien garnis et coûte moins de 10$. Service rapide et amical. Ils ont un gros roulement: Il y avait un flow continue de gens qui rentrait et sortait. Les pains sont très frais et gardez chaud. C'est délicieux! 

Ils offrent aussi la livraison aussi! Définitivement une place où je vais retourner."}
{"text":"Wow! $8 for a Banh Mi???? Unheard of, but I paid anyways. It was totally worth it! The French Canadian guy in the front was so nice & helpful. I ordered the Banh Mi pork Chop and it was filled with ALOT of meat inside along with a lot of flavors. I'm so happy I got to Atleast try this place before leaving."}
{"text":"I need more of there kind of place near my house ! When i'm craving something fresh, healthy, yummy and not expensive i always go to Sandwicherie Sue. The staff is very friendly and their shandwich and absolutely amazing. The portion are big for the price. It's a must go for in and out food."}
{"text":"Exellents sandwiches , tres gentil service, petite place bien organisé et propre, mini mini terrasse ;)"}
