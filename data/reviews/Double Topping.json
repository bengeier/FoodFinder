{"text":"Ordered hot wings because I'm hungry and on a ketogenic diet. These hot wings are loaded with sugar. I called to complain and the person that answered the phone told me that if I couldn't have sugar that I shouldn't have ordered hot wings. He tried to tell me that there is sugar in Frank's and all other hot sauces. Liar, bad customer service and terrible hot wings."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great guys to talk to. Read a review and this person made a reference to Isis, that's not cool. To the other review, they make pizza not to regulate your diet. Take responsibility for your own issues, don't blame others. Just so you know, any condiments has sugar in it. Omg go to the diabetic clinic and educate yourself.....FI"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings. It's the customer service that keeps us going back. Super friendly. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price!  Always walk in here for a slice and a pop when I'm in the Durham region for work. Service is good and quick. Pizza is delicious. They seem to doing a good business as a lot of people walk in to pick up their pizzas. Price is very good, cheaper than most places."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Owners are so friendly, very family oriented. Only place I'll order pizza from now on. The homemade dips are to die for."}
