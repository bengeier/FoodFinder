{"text":"They are fast and food and drinks are solid. I haven't tried their pho though but the shakes and the rice dishes (pork chops, chicken) are crave-worthy"}
{"text":"#505 all day everyday! The food is prepared and served quickly.  The pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"We go often as a family. Very spacious restaurant. Food taste good and value for money.  Service is good comparing to most of Vietnamese restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Our go-to spot for Pho. Mostly because it's close to home more than anything else. Broth can be counted on to be hot and tasty. Lots of seating so never an issue with getting a table right away. The shrimp rolls are made in advance and can get a little chewy but most of the time are good. The deep fried spring rolls are always a hit. Tea is poured when you sit but isn't generally refilled. Service is quick otherwise. Prices are about average."}
{"text":"I've been going to this pho location for a while now and just recently went there again after a long time of not going. I got a simple pho noodle soup with beef balls and medium rare beef and was surprised at how stingy they are with the meat. They gave me 3 halves of a beef ball and little ripped up pieces for medium rare beef... I asked the server if it was possible for me to get a bit more meat and he refused and was extremely rude about it. Super disappointed at what this place has become... if you're looking for a place where they'll give you stingy amount of food with rude customer service, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Similar to my last review, Pho Mi 89 has stared at me many a night over the years. For whatever reason, I never ventured in. I think it had more to do with my need to be somewhere else than my desire for soup but who knows.   Pho Mi 89 is deceptively large. From the outside you would think that it was a decent sized restaurant but then you enter an ice rink sized room with tables and chairs everywhere. I have never had to wait for a seat even when it's packed to the gills because there always seems to be one more table hiding in the back.   They serve a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes ranging from noodles and pho to tripe to condensed milk shakes. The portions are large and well worth the money. Their large menu has  something for everyone as I've taken omnivores, vegans and folks that just won't eat anything that doesn't involve steak in some way.   I would dare say that it was the first \"authentic\" place of it's kind that I've been too in Mississauga. If I wasn't looking out the large front windows I would swear I was in an out of the way, off a side street place in Toronto. The only \"competition\" in the area are places that sell french fries as a side to their broccoli and fried rice or General Tao's chicken. Extra MSG.   Pho Mi 89 is one of the few reasons I like eating in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  If you're not familiar with Vietnamese food,  you might have a hard time ordering.  The menu doesn't provide a lot of descriptions and the waiters have a hard time understanding what you would like to order."}
{"text":"To start off, I have never been at a PHO`s before, but I have had pad thai so I figure I got the basics down.   As soon as I walked in with a friend, we`re greeted by an employee who stares at you and puts up his fingers with how many people he thinks are in your party. I put 2 fingers up and he pointed at where we should park ourselves. So far, so good. Many times employees don`t even acknowledge you`ve been waiting to order for 20 minutes, and here, they notice you as soon as you open the door. Brilliant.  So then we get the menus and start looking through it. Now, I used to watch a lot of that show ``Restaurant makeover^`- you know the one where they tear down the restaurant and change the entire menu. Well, one of their rules is to keep the menu to one page. Pho has at least 8 pages. I`m not complaining since I love options, but when you`ve only ever tried Pad Thai, it can be overwhelming. After searching for a bit, I found the Pad Thai on page 6 - success .Now to order.   We sat there, looking around in patience, seeing how the employees were walking back and forth being busy so since neither of us want to  be rude and put our hands up, we simply waited until someone was ready to come to us. Luckily, this guy sitting next to us (who kept staring, putting me on edge and making me want to tell off soon) nicely told us that we had to fill out our order on the sheet of paper on the table and hand it in. So I guess they werent for coloring on after all......  We then get out food. I ordered the Pad Thai and calamari in curry, and my friend ordered some beef noodle thing and frog legs. The Pad Thai was amazing - probably the best I ever had. The calamari, not so much.. I love calamari, but I figured the dish would be fried calamari with curry dip. To be fair, the menu didn't say anything about anything being fried, nor the curry being a dip, so that was my bad. I didn`t like it--  Frog is something I`ve never had before, nor is something on my bucket list, but I figured id try it out. Many people say strange meat usually tastes like chicken, and this was no different. It was actually really good. I didnt expect that much meat on a frog leg but these had quite a bit. I wondered if it may have been a toad as I ate, but thought I should stop thinking about it before I weird myself out.   Overall - the food was great - the employees and customer service were very good, and the prices were decent as well. I`d definitively come back"}
{"text":"Busy place but big enough to handle it. Quick friendly service and very tasty dishes. I had satay, not super spicy but very good. Would recommend and would come back."}
{"text":"Pho me once, pho me twice....  Went here twice out of necessity because of pho lightning speed and proximity to some of our prenatal classes.  First time wasn't good, we chalked it up to a bad night, however tonight we were running late so we tried it again.    The pho itself was alright, piping hot, good meat to noodle ratio, but the fresh roll skins were very tough,  the fried spring rolls were nearly burnt and the final kick in the pants, the bean sprouts were brown with that long dying stringy bit at the ends.      Maybe a grilled meat plate or bun would have been a better choice.  I prefer Pho mi 99, or Cow head (not sure of the real name!).      Pho'd me twice...sigh."}
{"text":"Great prices, delicious food. I normally get their Pho (211 I think), but I've tried some of their other stuff and it's good too. The service is good, but don't go in expecting a waiter like other sit down places. They're really good with substitutions, too."}
{"text":"Bernadette pegged this one. But have to add that as you repeat visit they get to know your habits. ..mostly sigh...  but still a solid 3.5 because the vegetables are fresh...so a 3"}
{"text":"I organized a team lunch for some yummy Pho eats.  Pho Mi 89 came up on one of the places to check out because of its quick service and ample seating.  My colleagues and I ventured over and the location was indeed huge and busy for a Wednesday lunch time crowd.  Service was great, we got our food soon after we placed out order.  Unfortunately, my vermicelli dish was a bit dry; I have had better at other places.  Thought, my peers liked the Pho.  I might come back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Pretty spacious pho place. Never seen it sits full but always has customers. Tried several times for their hue style beef pho, and they are not as strong as some other pho places; portion wise, they are standard. The beef pho soups taste good overall. Must try is their rice dishes. Liked grilled pork and grilled chicken rice dinner; liked their rice because it was not cooked broken!aha! But they give little veggies as compare to the other pho places.This time we  also tried the fresh rolls, felt they were not so freshly made because the rice wrap was dried out; not a fan. The portion of the chilli stir fried cubed beef was surprisingly SMALL! Tastes fine. In general the dishes there tastes good but the portions are on the small side."}
{"text":"I loved this place compared to most Pho places it was huge with lots to choose from. They offer you tea and the spring rolls were exactly the yellow ones I wanted. Service was good staff was friendly. Didn't gave to wait much for the bill just had to Pay at the front."}
{"text":"It's your typical pho/Asian restaurant...  1. Walk in. 2. With a show of fingers, you tell them for how many people.  3. They point to a table for you to sit at. 4. They place menus on the table. 5. They serve tea. 6. You order. 7. Food comes. 8. You eat. 9. You pay.  10. You leave.   Simple.   There's very little interaction with the server unless you want something or if something is wrong. All they care about is you eating and paying lol  Food was good but been to better pho restos. I ordered medium rare beef with beef balls and rice noodles. There was a good amount of meat and noodles buttttt still had better."}
{"text":"Food were not that good.....rice was just plain white rice as compared to traditional Vietnamese.  Pho soup was salty..and the spicy soup noodle was noy spicy.  Meat didn't taste that fresh."}
{"text":"Great customer service but unfortunately the food was not the best. Had some pho, green curry and stir fry. All of which were below what I have come to expect of pho restaurant in Mississauga, Hamilton and Toronto. For the quality of product and portions I found that it was expensive."}
{"text":"Decent Pho but being Vietnamese, nothing will ever beat Moms homemade Pho. Not a fan of their fried rice, although my son enjoyed it very much, so I can't complain. Ordered the Spicy Thai Hot Pot (Lau Thai Lan) and their broth was basically sour soup (Canh Chua) broth with Sate sauce. It wasnt spicy at all. I was stoked when they brought out the plate of raw seafood and meat, but was deceived as it did not fill the three of us at all. Comparing it to the many places I've tried before, there was not much seafood and meat options, and the broth sucked. I would not order again, as I was still hungry after. One meal I did enjoy here, was their Bun bo Hue. Good service, fast, and cheap. I have gone back several times before, whilst in the area ofc. My mom likes their Pad Thai, so I will have to come back again to try."}
{"text":"The customer service here is unacceptable. We ordered a Rare Beef Pho with tripe. The servers only put two pieces of tripe and when I brought it to there attention they first took the soup away and talked to a manager. Upon returning the server then stated that we didn't specify that we wanted tripe. When we continued to explain to her that we order the medium rare beef with tripe pho they then stated that it's because we ordered a small. We have been to this restaurant many time and we have never received this small amount of tripe before. After the conversation the servers grouped together and started talking and staring at us. They created a unacceptable environment where we felt I welcomed. We will never return to this restaurant. They have little to no customer service skill and I highly  recommend that you avoid this restaurant is you have any respect for your self.  UPDATE: I've also had the runs for the past few hour.  (Cherry on top)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard pho place, meaning it's good. It doesn't have the best broth, but it is more than adequate to fill my pho cravings.   I only ever order 2 or 3 things. Most of the time I order their \"special\" which comes with an assortment of beef. Once in a while I will order a vermicelli dish. Never had anything bad. Prices are reasonable.   Typical of all pho places, there's no service and if you're expecting service, you need to adjust your expectations."}
{"text":"Ordered Pho Bo Kho, iced coffee, shredded pork rolls.  Service was ok, one good server, one less than attentive. Food is where the rating drops. Beef was so tough I didnt even eat most of it. Pork rolls were so dry I felt like I was eating cotton balls. Vietnamese iced coffee (as I know it) is served so that it drips into your glass from the beginning of the meal, but this place pressed it beforehand and brought a glass of ice... this robbed me of the experience.  Overall, I wouldn't eat here again, the food has gone downhill since I last came a few months ago."}
{"text":"We've eaten here multiple times and we have the same things over and over.  We asked the server what else is good on their menu.  He recommended diced beef with bell peppers on rice and pad Thai.  Both were delicious!   Will definitely go back and order these 2 dishes again! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and son's go-to pho place. The people are nice and the food is good. But you need to come a bit after 11 am since the beef broth needs time to set."}
{"text":"Disappointed, my family finished their meals and only then did my meal come. Needless to say, I wasn't happy but still gave a 25 percent tip on meals did receive as they were good."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant the other day and decided to try ... apparently it's been around for about 10 years. I ordered bún bò hu and it was ok. Normally it is served with beansprouts and shredded cabbage but this place served beansprouts and iceberg lettuce ... which u thought was different.  Authentic places will serve with shredded banana blossoms.  Overall it was ok ... but was not exceptional."}
{"text":"I'm a longtime fan of pho and since moving back I've been on a lookout for one to become my regular. I came here on a Friday night with my husband.  Food: We're not too adventurous and we like routine so we often get simple beef bowls. I ordered a small with rare beef, well done beef and beef balls. He ordered a small with beef brisket. We both really liked ours. It doesn't taste too different from other pho places (but that's not a bad thing) but we did think that there was more meat than others. I added the bean sprouts, the leafy herb and lots of hot sauce. As always we were provided with rice tea. I didn't order it this time but for the future I'd love to try a jack fruit shake. I've always enjoyed them in the past.  Service: Nice and quick. We came in, sat at a table and wrote our order down on a sheet of paper which they took. The food came really quickly. I appreciated that there was always someone around in case you needed something. Be aware that the bill doesn't come to you. You have to take note of your table number (near the utensils) and pay at the bar.  Overall experience: Great! This place is really big and spacious. It's also really clean. The location is pretty close to Meadowvale Town Centre with lots of shopping around. We will definitely be back for other Friday night date nights.   Cost: $7.00 for the small beef pho"}
{"text":"Pho mi pho you!   My favourite pho chain in the mississauga area, but this one in particular is my favourite one!   The moment you walk in this place is huge! This is one of the biggest if not thee biggest viet restaurant that I have ever been to. It has a very nice decor at the front and everything is nice and simple and very clean.   One big reason that this is my favourite pho mi, it's the people that work there. All the employees there are great, they are very friendly and easy to talk to. There are two employees there that will always have me coming back; the one being the big boss, or the asian super mario as my one friend would say, is really friendly he makes really great suggestions when you have no idea what to eat. As well, when it's not busy he will come and sit at my table and talk to me and my friends for a while. The 2nd guy, is a younger guy, very friendly as well and he likes to tell jokes.   On to the food, most people who come to this place its all about the vietnamese soup or pho. This is the biggest reason why most people come here, but if you don't want soup, the great thing about here is that there are so many options; from vietnamese, chinese, and thai food.   One lil thing that I've noticed with the pho soup, is that the small and medium size soups are not that much different. The only difference I see is that the medium soup has more broth but the same amount of ingredients as the small. Am i right? Let me know....   Items to definitely get   - fresh shrimp roll (12)  - seafood soup (113)  - pho house special (201)  - vermicelli w/ grilled chicken and pork (423)  - grilled chicken and pork on rice (506)  - satay beef on rice (513)   Yes, I know the number items on the menu. Kinda tells you how often I go here. :-p"}
{"text":"I drove all the way out here at 9:40pm to find out the kitchen was already closed. People were sitting and eating but got turned away. Very disappointing. They still had the open sign up and it shows that they open until 11pm."}
{"text":"Great food, nice owner. Would definitely recommend anyone to come eat here. The Vietnamese sweet and sour soup was really good."}
{"text":"My partner and I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month for date night. The food is cheap ($18 dollars easily pays for both our meals), the servings are HUGE and the pho/noodle soup is just incredible. I always get order #119 which is the vegetable noodle soup as well as a strawberry smoothie if I'm feeling like I can spare the room in my stomach! Their fried spring rolls are also delicious (and big!). Overall, we love this place and can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting Pho Mi 89 and I'm surprised I have not heard of this place before and I am Vietnamese! This restaurant has a very similar name to Pho Mi 99 and the menu and pricing is the same.   I generally order rice with the grilled porkchop and chicken every time I eat at a Vietnamese restaurant. I was excited to try this dish here to compare to the other places I've been to. The porkchop tasted good...it tastes pretty much the same as the other restaurants. However, I was disappointed with the grilled chicken. It was slightly dry and wasn't marinated well compared to Pho Mi 99 or Pho Dau Bo. I also had the spring rolls there and it was good...but not as good as Pho Mi 99.   Overall, I would recommend for you to eat here if you were in the area and were looking for Vietnamese food. However, if you were near a Pho Mi 99, I would definitely suggest that one over Pho Mi 89. Haha! I am not hating on Pho Mi 89...I just love Pho Mi 99 (especially the one on Latimer Drive)."}
{"text":"This Sunday we were in a lazy mood and looking for some lunch somewhere close to home and this Pho place definitely met our criteria. This place is located at the Meadowvale Town Center plaza along with some other great restaurant choices and we've been to this Pho place about 2-3 times for takeout. The interior was nice and spacious with a lot of seating available, which works out great during their busy lunch and dinner hours.    Service wasn't very outstanding so I would have actually given this place 3 stars if the quality of the food we ordered didn't taste so amazing. We walk in and the lady at the counter didn't acknowledge me when I approached. After 5 minutes of waiting, I had to say \"Excuse me\", to get her attention and ask her for a takeout menu, which she gave us along with an order form and pencil. Luckily, their menu is efficiently organized by letter and number that we just indicate in writing on the order form so even if there are language barriers, there are less chances of them messing up your order.   We ordered 2 chicken rice dishes with fried egg, and also added on a pork with shredded pork skins rice dish to share between me and my husband, just to try something new. The portions are generous considering the cheap price we paid for all of the food. The total of all items ordered came to about $27 before taxes and tip. Their chicken was nice and soft to eat and had a nice flavoring and their shredded pork was addictive. We were also pleased that they gave us an overabundance of lard to pour on top of our food for even more tastiness.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're living in North Mississauga and are craving Vietnamese food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"There's nothing especially spectacular about this place, but there's really nothing terrible about it either. The food for the most part is delicious and consistent. The staff sometimes seem to be a little short with us, but it may simply be because of a slight language barrier. In any case, I certainly enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the past 4 years and have always received great service and fresh food here. O.K, lets be honest here, Pho is something that is not hard to screw-up. It's harder to find quality Pho restaurants outside of downtown Toronto and Markham, but I am giving this place 4 stars based on quality of food, service and pricing. I recently tried their Tom Yum beef soup and it had a generous portion of beef in it. Tip...if you are coming here on a weekend, try and get there just around noon, as this place is very busy between 1pm and 3pm. My favourites here also include the \"House Pho Special\" and the vegetarian non fried spring rolls. $20 will cover a meal for 2 here with a main dish, non alcoholic beverages, taxes and tip. My new favourite Pho place in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"This is a run of the mill Vietnamese restaurant. The food is quick and simple but it is really stingy on anything of substance. The soup noodle dishes are medicore but it's mostly filled with cheap rice noodle with really tiny piece of beef. The vegetarian noodle soup has maybe 2 sprigs of brocolli and 3 slivers of tofu. Is it worth the $7 per bowl? Nope! The service is cold and forgetful. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this Pho place and while I was impressed with the size of the restaurant (wasn't expecting it to be so big by looking at the storefront from the outside), I was not happy with the food. My sister ordered the Pho - the noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was good, but it was a bit light on the meats, etc. I ordered the vermicelli bowl and while most other restaurants fill up the food to the brim, the bowl that I was presented with was underwhelming - the spring roll was yummy, but there wasn't enough noodles, veggies or meat pieces. The only reason why I tried this place was because it was close to home. Next time, I'll drive a bit further and go to I Love Pho on Dundas or even the Pho Mi 99 chain."}
{"text":"I miss eating good pho. I haven't found a good pho restaurant in the GTA. The Pho Mi chains are mediocre at best. I have tried a number of their dishes. The best so far is the beef stew (#227), which is essentially large chunks of tender beef with pho noodles in a reddish broth. You also can't go wrong with their traditional pho dishes. I have also tried their seafood in a nest. The picture in the menu is misleading because it shows noodles. I was tricked into buying this on two separate occasions because of the photo. My suggestion is to avoid the seafood. Some of the squid smelled funky. Their fried rice is too dry and too pricey for what you get.  Update: Their fried rice with \"curry\" isn't curry sauce. It's curry seasoning. I was unhappy about it. One dish that I did like was their rice with grilled chicken and fried egg. I was hoping for an over-easy egg, but it was sunny-side up."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The pho. The bun. The rice. The soup noodle.   All the dishes tasted relatively like other typical viet restaurants. Nothing particular that I want to point out at this restaurant. The pho comes in four sizes, which is flexible for people to choose from. However they are not generous with the sprouts and the basil. They don't give a lot so if you want more, make sure to ask. Especially the basil, you only get a small strand with two to three leaves.   The bun and the rice were good. The barbecued meat was alright. Didn't have the lemongrass fragrance that I find at another viet place I go to. The barbecued meat didn't have the nice smell that comes with viet barbecued meats!  LAST TIP?!  When it comes to pho, make sure you go down the list of options. Lots to choose from and different ways to combine the meats, whether it is beef, chicken or pork!"}
{"text":"I absolutely have a soft spot for pho places. This place did not disappoint me. We came in around 9:15pm on a Sunday and it was quite empty. They automatically brought us tea to drink. After we wrote down what we wanted they did not take long at all to being us our food! I got a small special pho and it was a decent size for the price. It was piping hot! Extremely tasted and flavourful.  I will be returning here if I am ever in the Meadowvale Town Centre area in Mississauga."}
