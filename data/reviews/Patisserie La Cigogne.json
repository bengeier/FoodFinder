{"text":"Let's start with the positive: the pastries, baguette, and sandwiches here are great. (I haven't tried the quiche.) The country-style pate sandwich is my favourite.

The reason I only give it three stars is because of the service. And not that the staff aren't helpful - they are. They're great. It's just that there are never enough of them. Twice I've come here and there is only a SINGLE person trying to cover the cash register, make coffee, get pastries for people, and serve tables. Totally impossible!

Or during the lunch rush, there might be TWO people. They still can't keep up. They're trying, but they can't keep up. It ends up being a frustrating experience for me, and I'm sure it's frustrating for them, too. I really wanted to love this place --- it's very close to my house --- but I just can't deal with the lineups when taking things to go, and slow service when eating in the restaurant.

If they only did coffee and take-out pastries and baguette, it would be fine, but with sandwiches and quiche, and table service, and fancy coffees, it just doesn't work.

So this three-star review is not really aimed at the food, or the staff: I'm hoping that the owners read this and start putting some more employees in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"French (Quebec?) tourtiere was yummie, however WiFi was NFG... Very \"hit and miss\", as I understand it. Staff were very helpful... Won't return unless WiFi fixed..."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by chance... reminded me of laboulangebakery in San Francisco. Nice Ambiance. Will definately drop by again"}
{"text":"The location is great!
I have been twice. Once for a morning 'snack' after playtime at the park, and another time to pick up a cake.

The croissants are delish.  I have only had the almond.  Very fresh and full of flavour.  My only advice would be for a richer coffee.
When I went to buy a cake for a dinner party I took a chance and asked if they had anything gluten free (for a dinner guest). Tada!!! They had two cakes available that were in fact gluten free.  It appears that they don't advertise this (perhaps it discourages people). I can't remember the exact name of the cake, but it had a gluten free brownie crust and had the word tropical in it.  There was mango mousse and white chocolate involved...YUM!

I wouldn't hesitate to go there again!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for brunC. The brunch itself wasnt inpressive, but their pastry was really nice. My friend bought a small rasperry cheese cake ans louis 16, both gorgeous ans very tasty. Its unfortunate we dont live around here, otherwise we would definitely come back and try the other cakes!"}
{"text":"This place has saved me so many times: whether I need a special dessert, an iced coffee on a hot summer day, a baguette, a mid-morning croissant (my favourite is the ham and cheese), or a Sunday brunch, they never disappoint. The croque madame is luscious, and the two vegetarian sandwiches are just lovely. If you want a touch of something special, you should stop by. 

One tip: order espresso, not coffee. The drip coffee is a bit weak for my tastes. Or, you could order their hot chocolate, which is always rich and flavourful with a pleasing creaminess."}
{"text":"Grabbed some croissants and a baguette for take out this morning. The almond croissants were the best I've ever had. Going back for brunch soon!"}
{"text":"I want this place to improve as it's on my street, and a quality cafe/bakery is not only convenient to have nearby but can only add value to the area. I've visited enough times to have tried many items. The croissants, when fresh, are utterly delicious, especially the chocolate ones.The fancy cakes, however, look MUCH better than they taste. The high price point of the cakes must be due to the time it takes to decorate them because the flavour and consistency certainly don't warrant those prices. Now here is my real complaint about the place - the service! My husband and I have been in there on several occasions when we've had to stand directly in front of the cash register for several minutes while an employee, standing two feet in front of us, looks at bills or wraps cakes without so much as looking up to tell us she'll be with us shortly. Each time, we've had to simply pipe up and make our order before our presence has even been acknowledged. We were there yesterday when I discovered, upon going to fill my coffee cup, that the House Blend was in the back with fresh coffee in it. I asked the man behind the counter for that urn. After waiting by the coffee station for 10 minutes with an empty cup while he fiddled with some receipts and then went to a table to discuss a bill with some customers, I asked him, while he floated by me, for that urn. He said, \"They didn't get it yet?!\" and picked up the urn. He came over to me and while he put the urn in place he informed me that they hadn't brewed anything and that it was, in fact, still the old coffee inside. At this point I just wanted coffee and said it wasn't a problem. Well, the coffee was only warm and the French Roast, which I figured I'd top it off with, was empty. I didn't even get to fill my cup. I left the cup with my husband at the table and went to wash my hands. Upon leaving the washroom, I saw an employee (a French woman with dark hair) standing by the light of the back door, looking into a hand mirror and applying lipstick. I very politely informed her that the House blend needed brewing and the French Roast was empty. She said, \"Okay.\" After sitting with my husband for a good 15 minutes while we shared the now-cool coffee and ate our croissants, I went to top up with some hot coffee only to discover the House Blend was again missing and the French Roast was still empty. I approached the same woman who had been applying lipstick and was now behind the counter and, in a very friendly manner, said I'd like to top up my coffee. She barked, \"just a second!\" and marched over to the urn. When I met her at the coffee station, she slammed the urn into place and pulled out the French Roast to brew with a surly look on her face and didn't say a word to me! I couldn't believe how rude she was. We are always very friendly and polite when in there and we always put money in the tip jar. If these people resent their jobs so much, perhaps they should leave and give others a chance at employment. Management, you have to talk to your staff about their manner with customers. We should be greeted with a smile and made to feel as though we are welcome and appreciated."}
{"text":"Had a really nice brunch here. A few minor kinks due to new restaurant and inexperienced staff, but everyone was really nice and helpful. Food was very good, only disappointment was a very weak latte, which could easily be rectified with some better instruction on making espresso.

I am sure I will be back frequently - welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"Wir bestellten  Tee und Cappuccino sowie 2 Quiche mit Spinat und Ziegenkäse. Nach ewiger Zeit kam der Cappuccino. Der Tee wurde vergessen. Wir haben auch nichts gesagt, da wir dachten, nagut, dann kommt er eben mit dem Essen - aber Fehlanzeige. Wir haben erneut nichts gesagt, da mir die Lust auf Tee vergangenen war. 
Das Essen war sehr lecker. Warm frisch und lieb angerichtet. Salat mit lecker Dressing gibt's beim Lunch dazu. Portionen schön zum satt werden. 
Der jungen Mann, der uns bediente, hatte wohl seinen ersten Tag . Unglaublich langsam und Bestellung nicht vollständig . Service mäßig essen lecker . Die süßen Dinge sahen fantastisch aus und den anderen Gästen zufolge ebenfalls lecker. 
Diese Bewertung bezieht sich auf die Filiale in der Bayview Avenue."}
{"text":"I just had a very enjoyable lunch here with my mother and baby. The quiet, relaxed atmosphere was nice. My mom had a quiche and loved it. I had the vegetable sandwich which was served on a delicious baguette. Both came with a simple mixed green salad with zesty homemade dressing. The unlimited coffee gave us lots of time to chat!"}
{"text":"I love that this place recently opened in my neighborhood.  We've been 3 times so far and I think it improves every time.

When we went opening weekend the place was packed and there was nothing left on the shelves.  Rather than wait the fifteen minutes until the next batch of pastries was out of the oven, and much to my husband's disappointment, we went across the street for brunch.

We returned during the week and had croissants on the sun-filled patio and the following weekend took our pastries to go.  The almond brioche was unbelievable! Their croissants certainly stand up to their reputation as the best in the city.  The espresso drinks are satisfying, but not the best.

This place has a great atmosphere (inside and out).  Most of the staff still seems to be in training, which I will be patient with for a few more visits.  I wish that they would label the baskets so that I could tell what I had to choose from without asking every time.   I also wish that they had Wi-fi."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good - this place is clean, the french bread and quiche are great and the cakes and pastries look delicious. Now the bad - the customer service here is very poor. I recently moved to the neighbourhood and I have come in three times looking for breakfast or lunch. All three times I have had to initiate an interaction with one of the two or three people behind the counter because not once has anyone here even acknowledged that there is a customers standing in front of them. The first time I came here was the worst - I told the lady I wanted to have breakfast and she just kind of waved at a stack of menus and went back to whatever she was doing. I grabbed a menu and sat down and waited... and waited... and waited. I got frustrated after about 20 minutes of being completely ignored while seeing the two other occupied tables receive food, so I got up and left. 
On my two subsequent visits to buy baked goods I was again completely ignored by staff that could obviously see me standing in front of them, so I think it's safe to say that the very poor service here is an ongoing problem. It's unfortunate because I had hoped this would be a place I could take visiting relatives for tea and treats. Too bad."}
{"text":"Try out their Pear Sabayon!  We also love their mini cakes on display!
Great place for a date :)"}
{"text":"I've only had the macaroons so this review is specific to those. They taste great (not the best in the city, but still quite good). The reason I've rated them lower is that the sizes are really inconsistent - some macaroons are at least an inch and a half across, yet others were smaller than a quarter. I bought a sleeve of them and it was easy to see the differences.

Gourmet desserts charged at a premium should be consistent, or at least priced accordingly when they're clearly not comparable. When I asked the woman behind the counter if she wouldn't mind grabbing the bigger one behind the one she had selected, she told me they were all the same size. Thumbs down for that not being true, and also for not acknowledging it (and not being honest) either."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I adore the food at this place. I love the baguettes, the meals, and the pastries. I have had so-so service in the past, but I have been here enough times (at least ten, if not more), to really weigh my words carefully.

Today I stopped by for lunch after an appointment. One of the servers came to my table after I said hello at the counter, and left 2 menus, even though I was alone - not a big deal - and told me I could come order at the counter. After a short time considering what I would order, I went up, placed my order and paid for my food and latte, leaving a tip in the jar as well. I sat down for about 15 minutes, read my emails, and wondered where my latte was. I went up to the counter and asked about my order. The server who had taken my money told me she had brought my food and it was on the table. I told her no one had served me, and she basically told me I was wrong. I then firmly told them to come and look. They took 5 minutes to arrive at the table, and then another 10 to bring a sandwich. No latte ever arrived. They were not even at one third capacity during this visit.

I am not a nightmare customer - I will put up with most levels of service, and not return when I am not happy, and frankly it takes a lot for me to yell at anyone. This was one of those times I probably would have been justified in raising my voice more than I did. However, I left a note, telling them to make sure to check all their tables in future, and feeling in a generous, festive mood, also left $20 on the table. I really hope they get the message. Their food is really, really good."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give a rating of less than 1 star? If so, this place deserves it. I had family in town to visit the city and we thought we would catch brunch here. Do not go. The service is probably the worst you will ever experience. We were given a dirty table on the patio and had to wait for it to be cleaned. After 15 minutes, we hadn't even seen a server and I had to get up to get our own menus. No one arrived for our order so we eventually went inside to place it and forced to wait in line behind others just entering. Promptly picked up our things and walked out. Hands down the worst customer service and greeting. This is certainly not the way to run a restaurant and I will not be returning. Needless to say, my family was also quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited twice. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. The pastries are delish & do taste like ones found in Paris - especially the almond croissant & pain au chocolat. I also quite enjoyed the quiche. Service is a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and patio but a little expensive for an iced coffee...$4.00 for a regular. I could get one for cheaper at Starbucks! I also didn't like the cup the iced coffee was served in...it was plastic and looked like it should have been served to a child. Besides that, this is a cute little place with some very tasty looking treats!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. French pastries and their prices at Patisserie La Cigogne are almost identical to other French bakeries in the city, but they are more spacious and comfortable. The neighborhood is a residential area, so people and the shops are more relaxed. I can stay and relax for a while. I order tea and they give me a pot. It is a lot. My friend orders a cup of coffee and later he can get free refill. I am happy about it. I would love to go back there."}
{"text":"I Love their dressings. Their best desserts are \"Opera\", \"BabaRum\" and \"Paradise\" Yum!. They make great quiches but some times the lettuce in the salad are rotting. Today  my dessert isn't as fresh as it should be and the strawberry on top is over ripened (disappointed). The sandwiches sometimes have darkening lettuce on the edges. They are outrageously expensive and most of their gelatos suck. Other than that, A-Ok. Greedy though, no question about it! Oh! the owner doesn't seem to be very nice to her staff (they become very uneasy when she is around, seem afraid to ask questions or make mistakes...That's a REAL turn off for me :( 
...When the owner (an oriental looking woman with an attitude of superiority) is not around, the staff are very nice and friendly :)"}
{"text":"It is a very nice environment and food is good. Salad is fresh and nice dessert selections."}
{"text":"This review is for the beautiful croque m bouche for 30 that i ordered for my sons confirmation half was grand marnier the other chocolate.  It had sugar orchids placed thru out.  it was the hit of party.  pic attached.  the best dessert i have had ever.. $160"}
{"text":"Yummy desserts and good, staple coffee. I remember they have free coffee refills which is cool. The place is neat and quiet, good for reading or studying. Staff are nice and polite too."}
{"text":"Spectacular pastries! If you are looking for any form of croissant, you're taking your chances if you arrive later in the day. For some reason they are usually sold out before noon."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice now and the service has been somewhat inconsistent. The first visit was great however the second time they didn't acknowledge our table for what it felt it was perhaps 10-15minutes. However I do know they are capable of good service and the quality of food is too amazing to even care about the service really. 

The coffee is house brewed (try the dark roast...it's delicious), the almond croissants are to die for and the tourtiere and/or omelette is a great way to start the day. 

The place is very cozy and offers free Wi-Fi, so if you're looking for a place to study and relax here's the perfect place. 

I believe they specialize in desserts, the selection is huge and appetizing but also great for a cheat day if you're on a diet as they have small dessert to choose from."}
{"text":"The rating above is for the almond croissant - which is one of my ultimate favourites in the city (and the only thing I've tried here). A tad expensive, but the flakiness and the amount of almond paste inside is just about perfect."}
{"text":"We just moved in the neighbourhood, friends of us visiting us from France get croissants and pains au chocolat from this place for breakfast. I'm also French, making me a croissant expert by default, they are nice!!! It really taste like home. They make it very 'buterry' but really tasty! It is a pleasure to break night fast with their croissants! Get some for your lady in the morning!"}
{"text":"Took my mother for Mother's Day and it was fantastic! Croissants are are as close as I've to my old home in Grenoble. Quiche and Omelets were also up to snuff and the Macarons might just be the best I've ever had. Not sure if everything is made in house, but it sure as Hell tastes like it. Definitely worth the drive from Waterloo and I'll be happy to go back again.

Finished the brunch off with Pistachio, Hazelnut and Blood Orange ice cream/ gelato. Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times getting cakes for special events and find the food great. A little pricey but worth it. I found the hot chocolate and coffee to be nothing special though but those cakes..."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place is really tricky because the place is really inconsistent!

I've had really mediocre experiences and some of the best ever from this local french bakery.

I'll start with the amazing point that inspires me to even write a review in the first place and I'll start with a bit of backstory.

Many years ago I lived in France for about a year while doing my master's degree. I would wake up early to catch the bus to the university and I'd always buy an almond croissant for breakfast as it quickly became my absolutely favourite French baked good.

After returning to Canada, I searched far and wide for an almond croissant that would scratch my itch and it wasn't until I found this place that I finally found something I enjoyed. What's more, and here is where the story gets interesting, the almond croissant here was better than any I had ever had in France!

I was wondering if it had only been too long since I had a good almond croissant so I bought a half dozen and brought them to a Parisian friend of mine who now lives in Toronto. She actually agreed that these ones were the best she had EVER had! Funnily enough, one time I was dropping by to buy a few and another person in line was ordering them so I struck up a quick conversation and even he agreed that they were better than the ones he's had in France too!

The thing is that every other type of French baked good I've gotten here is absolutely mediocre. Not bad, but not special. Even worse, there have been days more recently where even their almond croissants are half-assed and not what they were a few years ago.

So here I am giving this place 3 stars. I'd give them 2 stars for most of their half-assed baked goods and a magical 6 stars for their most-of-the-time best almond croissants ever! 

As I read through some of the other reviews, I'm not surprised to see people singling out the almond croissants as what they like the most. Not surprised at all!

As long as you catch them on a good day, which is luckily most days, and I'm beginning to guess is earlier in the day when they are fresher; then this place is worth a bloody pilgrimage JUST for the almond croissants. Otherwise, meh!"}
{"text":"You know a birthday cake is good when it beats homemade.

I bought my sister their \"Africa\" cake (chocolate with walnuts and layers of sponge cake) and it was so good me and my two 50 pound sisters finished it in two days. 

Then birthday sister got home and her husband offered to bake her a birthday cake - he's a former chef - and she said no thank you, she'd already had the best cake ever. That's high praise.

Also, their salmon quiche is awesome..."}
{"text":"I go here frequently for meetings and really enjoy the quiet atmosphere and incredibly friendly staff. The pastries are delicious, but they run out of the good stuff fairly quickly, especially on weekends. I appreciate the free coffee refills, but keep in mind d it's self service. If coffee and pastries is what you want, and a dessert drink in a mug is overkill, skip the Starbucks across the street and come here instead."}
{"text":"After walk I stopped in for a coffee and crossiant.  Wednesday evening at about 6:10. The woman working was counting her cake inventory and did not greet us. She continued counting and finally asked us what we wanted. She was so unfriendly and I could tell that she didnt want to be bothered with customers. 

I placed my order which was simple. A coffee (which is self serve) a latte and a croissant. She asked is it to stay or go. I said to stay. She then tells me oh I am going to give it to you in to go cups because we are closing soon. It is now 6:18 and they close at 7:00. This lazy woman didnt want to wash dishes or serve customers.

 There are more coffee and dessert places popping up in this area. I would rather visit a place that is happy to see paying customers. I think this establishment should rethink their staff."}
{"text":"I've only been the once so far, but I'm definitely going again.

It's basically a french bakery with some meal food. It's a big place, with tons of seating -- more than I imagine they need. They have lots of croissants, brioches, danishes, cakes, eclairs. They also have sandwiches, quiches and meat pies (tourtières). They serve brewed and espresso coffee.

I've had a slice of quebec tourtière (good), a croissant (great), an almond croissant (I'm not ususally a fan, but it was good). The service was friendly and reasonably fast. The coffee was meh.

Given their breakfast appeal, It'd be great if they could move up to 'great' coffee, then I could go there for a croissant and a coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars

Came here with my aunt and cousin to grab a \"quick\" lunch during his break between assessment tests at the Greenwood School.  

I had heard good things about La Cigogne, and was even more excited that they opened up shop closer to the East end so I don't have to trek all the way up to Bayview.

There is an outdoor, shaded patio which is nice for the summer months.  When I arrived, there was only 1 other table of 2 moms and their posse of tots.  I did alert the server (who was authentically French), that we were kind of pressed for time as we only had a half hour for lunch.  She replied with a facial spasm of sorts that she would try but that there's no guarantee.  We had already scoped out the display and knew what we wanted.  2 Bacon, Egg & Ham quiches and a Mushroom & Spinach Quiche.  All quiches come with a side salad and rings in at $8.99. I also ordered an Earl Grey Tea and coffee.

The coffee is self-serve and they use the Van Houtte brand here.  Twinnings is the brand of tea they use.  I expected more out of a local patisserie than Van Houtte - but then again I'm comparing it to the likes of Tango Palace Coffee Company, Ezra's Pound etcetera - all independent coffee houses.

How long does it take to reheat a quiche and to mix a salad?  Even an amateur cook such as I can do it in less than 5 minutes.  We ended up waiting 20 minutes before our food showed up!  This is without a doubt an authentic French establishment with their laissez-faire service.

I ordered the Mushroom & Spinach Quiche with my mom's homemade version in mind.  I think they should hire my mom as her quiche is infinitely better.  This one was too much spinach and mushroom and not enough egg and cheese!  It tasted way too \"earthy\" for me!  The only redeeming factor is that the quiche crust is buttery and flavourful.  The salad was baby spinach, grape tomatoes and dried cranberries served with a side of Dijon vinaigrette.  The salad was fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty.

I didn't get a chance to try their pricey croissants ($1.95 for a plain, $2.50 for chocolate and $3.00 for an almond), macarons, or other beautifully-crafted pastries, but will definitely be back in the future when I'm not racing against the clock."}
{"text":"Perfect butter croissants and yummy baguettes.  Next week they're having a \"seven days powered by chocolate sale\" -- two-for-one chocolate croissants... I will fatten up for winter on those!"}
{"text":"Walked in here with friends on a chilly day. It's much bigger than it looks from the outside!

We decided to treat ourselves to warm and comforting French lunch. I ordered the Beef and Mushroom Tourtiere. It's like a slice of quiche/pie. Very yummy and large slice for the price. My friend and I also shared a pot of Earl Grey (which was about 3 cups between us).

Service is very prompt. We also got ourselves dessert (a chocolate eclair). They had many tasty treats on display, including chocolates. But I was too full to even glance at the display.

I'm hardly in this particular neighbourhood, but if/when I return, I will be coming by for some treats!"}
{"text":"Eastern Danforth is known for a lot of amazing ethnic delicacies, but until now it has been the last place on earth you would go for a delectable French patisserie. 

The croissants (plain, almond and chocolate) are to die for. The custards, however, are the most amazing things I have ever eaten. This is their second store, I believe.

Lots of places to sit and VERY family-friendly.

The only thing I don't like here is the French loafs. I find them a bit hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"An outing to Patisserie La Cigogne is kind of like starring in your own Woody Allen movie, if only for a few moments out of your day. 

Crossing the threshold from Danforth & Monarch Park (home to Sarah's Pub, as well) and into the bakery/cafe is how I imagine temporarily stepping into Paris might be. All of the staff are French-speaking and, for some reason, many of the patrons are as well. I wasn't aware of the volume of Francophones in this part of my neighbourhood but they exist and they all hang out at Patisserie La Cigogne. 

Fantastic chocolate croissants, butter croissants, danishes, baguettes. Really, everything is good. Pricing is a bit steep, but you simply cannot prepare the integrity of a handmade (by Parisians, no less) baked good from this place to one from the Tim Horton's a few blocks away. And while there's no doubt that Tim's will do in a pinch, Patisserie La Cigogne is a fantastic way to treat yourself, a perfect cafe setting to relax or enjoy a nice brunch and a place where you can bring your kids. 

What you can't bring, however, is your kids' stroller. Don't even try. Sadly this location is not very accessible and thank goodness the offering are calorie dense, because once you've hefted your kid out of their stroller and up the big step into the bakery, you've worked up a sufficient hunger. Or at least that's what I tell myself when I order two pastries (for me) and eat them (on the way home). 

A bit pricey, not too accessible, but fantastic fresh foods on offer."}
{"text":"For a cake that's a bit more expensive than a high-end grocery store cake, I came away really impressed.

After searching around for a bakery, I decided to give this place a try based on recommendations from some friends.  They have a pretty good selection of cakes and I ultimately settled on Bacarra, an opera-styled cake with dark chocolate ganache, caramel cream, crunchy pistachio and peaches.  I really loved how well the peaches complimented the pistachio and chocolate. 

There's also a sit-down portion of the restaurant.  I came here for a breakfast croissant and coffee.  The regular croissant wasn't too bad - it was fluffier than ones I've had elsewhere, but also hollow in the middle.  The almond croissant was a denser, sweeter, version.  They weren't my favourite croissants I've had in the city but are a solid 3/5. 

Coffee is self-serve with unlimited refills.  

Overall, I'd definitely come back to order another cake but I'll probably give the croissants a pass unless I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but they don't seem very well organized. Service was friendly but far from professional. The brunch dishes we had--quebec tourtierre and croque madam--were fine, but nothing remarkable. The price points seemed a bit high, too. Can't comment on the bakery side, tho. I want them to succeed, but they don't quite have it together yet."}
{"text":"A cute patisserie on the Danforth, Patisserie La Cigogne provides a nice large space to enjoy your morning breakfast/tea, lunch or afternoon tea!

Coming here on a weekday morning, I purchased a crossaint and a teapot with Earl Grey Tea for $7 to $8. The tea wasn't anything too special, so the cost of the tea in my opinion wasn't too worth it as it costed around $4, but the crossaint was delicious! The texture of the crossaint was flakey and crisp on the outside with a soft dough on the inside and it was served in a cute basket to catch all of your crumbs. The price of the crossaint is a little more than your average Tim Horton's Crossaint, but for something that costs slightly more than Starbucks, I would purchase this crossaint any day.

The overall ambiance was lovely, I like how the rooms are partitioned into two to allow guests to choose their space of comfort!

They also had beautiful pastries, cakes and macarons - which unfortunately I didn't get a chance to purchase, but I think if I stop by the area next time, I will definitely pick some up to try!"}
{"text":"The almond croissants are bomb. So, so good. I've tried most of the cakes as well, and they have yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. What an absolute diamond to find in a surprising area. All the the pastries I've tried are outstanding and the quiche that has the goat cheese and cranberries in it is fabulous too. A+"}
{"text":"I agree, good almond croissant.  Not the best I've had, though among the best in the city and certainly the best in their neighbourhood. Worthy of going out a little bit out of your way for. So a good place to go if you are stranded in the East End.

If you live in the neighbourhood, you should support this place because this is the first decent place in a series of meh restaurants on that corner. Also, it adds something that your neighbourhood needs: a good French bakery."}
{"text":"I like the free coffee refills and the sandwiches are very good. Sometimes the staff seems a little surly and once I ordered iced  coffee and they didn't even ask me how I like it and brought me one that must have been loaded with cream and sugar, which I'm not eating right now. 

The desserts look delish but I haven't tried them, the washrooms are clean and so is the dining area. I'd definitely recommend the place to anyone looking for a nice coffee shop or for brunch."}
{"text":"Great place for desserts (but not the service). One lady operates everything from the food prep to the cash register, so this might be the reason why things are a bit slower.

I ordered a lemon tart to go. They can give you a box that houses one individual tart. This tart is not too sweet and the lemon curd has the perfect tartness to it. It is a bit pricey at $5.75, but reminiscent of my lemon tart tea times in Australia.

The sandwiches are alright, as I ordered the barbeque pulled pork sandwich. The fresh baguette is probably the best part to the sandwich. The pulled pork itself was a little cold, but well flavoured.

The latte to go was hot. Nothing special about the drinks."}
{"text":"I have gone there many times for their great cakes and never disappointed. Great place for a lunch or cake"}
{"text":"Overpriced and quwstionable quality. A place where a simple croissant costs you almost $3 and you better hope that you will get a real croissant.
 Please see my pictures.
 the lady in the front will go to the back and collect everything that she can find and does not look like croissant, puts it in a bag, bring it to you and charge you an arm and a leg.
When I called to complain as this was the 4th time since June 2017; she sarcastically responded \"next time when you come we will give you a handsome croissant\"."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little bakery where you can also go for a quick bite. The staff are friendly and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Bought two pieces of cake to go. 

Opera cake: coffee chocolate cake. Layered with powerful coffee and chocolate flavour and super soft. Really liked this one. 4/5

Pistachio hazelnut almond cake: couldn't taste the Pistachio. Liked the almond crunch layer and hazelnut crust. Wished there was more pistachio flavour. Liked the presentation of this cake. 3/5

Pretty pricey. At $6.50 a slice. The opera cake was pretty small in comparison to the pistachio cake. 

Cafe is spacious and clean. Free wifi for anyone that wants to study there."}
{"text":"This place has good pastries and coffee at Starbucks prices. I paid over 8$ for a coffee and a pastry. The pastries are neatly arranged for easy viewing. They do offer self-serve coffee refills, so figure that this is added to the price.

There is plenty of seating, making this an ideal place for a morning meeting on the Danforth. It is noteworthy that they will allow you to pay after you have finished- not a bad old school touch."}
{"text":"Just one other thing --- we LOVE love LOVE the almond croissants.

I really think they are the best (to date) I have had in the city.

Pair that with a nice latte and you are all SET!"}
{"text":"Saw that this was in my neighbourhood so decided to give it a try!

I had purchased a regular croissant and an almond croissant.

The croissants were very flaky however I can't say I was too pleased with the regular croissant as it had a burnt taste to it (which I really don't care for).

The almond croissant was really good, I would go back for that one. They had a beautiful display of sweets which I would like to go back to try."}
{"text":"My go to place for french parties!  The almond croissants are amazing!  Parking is a bit problematic.   The server was very attentive."}
{"text":"They make great mousse cakes that look really pretty. I  always buy my birthday cakes here. Never had brunch or anything else. 

The Asian girl behind the cashier didn't know what's in the cake too well and pretended to know (my lie detector was registering red). She was as cold as the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Reading all these other awesome reviews for La Cigogne, I really hate to be the downer, but my experience with them just hasn't been anything memorable. I speak for the selection of desserts I've tried as well as a brunch visit with family. 

Pros: 
Gorgeous pastries and cakes.
Large selection of baked goods and breads.
Great location appealing at the families of the area.
Free Wifi.
Pleasant staff.
           
Cons: 
The flavours don't do the descriptions nor the    appearances justice. 
The weirdly dense crusts were virtually snapping off from both the tourtiere and midsection of the cake I tried.
Self-serve coffee is subpar in taste and freshness.
Long wait times for food that was essentially just   reheated out of the display case. ...it really is visually appealing though. 

Either Or: 
Every time I've been, \"French\" instrumentals piped through the cafe. Depending on your musical tastes, this can swing towards being too contrived or adding to the authenticity of your visit.

I really wanted to like this local bakery. I thought it was going to be my new place for a quality cake fix, but at the price point of $6-7 dollars per miniature, I'd rather trade in my box of them for a supermarket cake. I'll stick to Ruelo when I want pretty *and* delicious dessert goodness. And as for brunch, onward to Queen Street."}
{"text":"Croissant my life please."}
{"text":"Superb food selection both for sandwiches and deserts. Good service. Need to have better coffee though."}
{"text":"Having been here a few times, the only reason was because it is across the street from El Sol, so when we pick up take out there, I send hubby in to pick up a dessert here.

The Opera cake is my favourite, a rich coffee and chocolate dessert best served chilled that is not as cold as the service here.

The other reviewers aren't wrong, it can be like pulling teeth to get service here.

The other location on Bayview is much, much better, perhaps because their clientele would not put up with this sort of lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Average bakery. We had some of the croissants, tarts and other treats from here. Some of the items here did not taste fresh, and the croissants were nothing to write home about. there are better French bakeries with similar prices in this area. One plus side is that  there are lots of seats here."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of brunching here for Mum's day this past weekend and given how picky my fam is about pastries in general it was a grand success!

I had a fair sized slice of veggie quiche with mushrooms and spinach and a side of baby greens.  It was subtley tasty with a good firm crust and nicely eggy without a trace of sliminess and  wonderfully custard-y it actually reminded me of chawanmushi :)  good stuff!!

Mom had Quebecois style tourtière and hoovered it down with great relish and lil' sis, the true gastonome among us had country-style paté on a baguette and marvelled at how much it reminded her of baguette sandwiches from a recent Paris trip.  Patisserie La Cigogne also offers self serve coffee with free refills, sweet!

The service was lovely and one of the servers even has a delightful authentic French accent which certainly is a plus!  I appreciated that the service here is relaxed and unharried as mum, sis and myself dined for nearly three hours without any vibes from the waitstaff to hurry up.

On a minor note, the interior was a little hot but the server did apologize as she explained the AC was bust.  On another completely un related note, I just noticed their website posts baby pics provided by their clients...adorable! http://www.patisserielacigogne.com/lacigognebabies/lacigognebabies.html

Just like their trademark stork symbol, Patisserie la Cigogne delivers mad flavour and French charm to a neighbourhood that deserves some Gallic flare."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to pop in here, but I must save my calories for wine. So I haven't. Today a friend brought me an almond croissant from this place. It was delicious! So rich and savoury. So moist and yet crisp. I will make a point of visiting myself soon and will expand this review!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to pick up some Danishes on the way to a friend's place and were greeted and helped immediately. I thought it might just be a take away sort of place but noticed there were tables and ample seating.

We got several different Danishes and didn't get to try them all but were happy with our picks. Our hosts said they were very good and better than their usual place. The price was also very reasonable, I think it ended up being $2.50 for each Danish?

We ordered 2 extra Danishes (the apricot pistachio one) for a Monday morning breakfast treat and were very happy with how they held up in our fridge. The apricot-pistachio ones are also very beautiful in the presentation and would delight anyone on sight even if apricot and pistachio aren't your jam.

While service was good it did feel like there was something of a language barrier. I can't really explain what was happening but every request we made was followed by several confirmations from the staff. I think some things that could be improved are better signage for the baskets of pastries and boxes (instead of paper bags) to take away large orders of Danishes.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. The service was AWFUL.

I went with some guests from out of town. We waited at our table for over twenty minutes before a server came over. We asked for menus, she handed us the catering menu. It looked great, but I was hoping for a sandwich not a 12\" quiche. I asked again and pointed out that we wanted lunch and weren't looking to order cakes for 40. I was informed that that was the menu. Funny because I was there earlier in the week and there were two different menus. So I wandered around and found a stack of lunch menus on the pastry counter.

It was another twenty minutes before they came back to take the orders. 

The food that arrived was mostly edible, but there was bad salmon in the quiche and a ton of sand in the salad. My sandwich was slathered in mustard. It wasn't mentioned in the menu but apparently they only prepare the roast beef with mustard. I wrapped it up and brought it home for my husband. Oh well.

Every request was met with an upturned nose. Honestly some of the worst service I've ever had. At one point I considered asking if they wanted us to leave.

It's too bad, we're local and have been before without incident, but the waitress today made it very clear we weren't welcome. Don't worry honey, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Compare to Patisserie La Cigogne's location on Bayview, this location on Danforth is huge with this nice side shaded patio..... 

Great selections of French pastries and individual cakes...and great services... 

Green Tea cake ($5.25) has great matcha taste and with a great nutty taste that compliment each other. It is a little pricey.... especially in this neighbourhood?? 

Nice staff helps me select some chocolate and truffles to surprise my friends.. Caramel, Black Currants and Hazelnuts? My friends seemed to enjoy them without complaining? I guess they must be quite good. 

I definitely be back to have a cappuccino and croissant on the patio next time when I am in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great tasting croissants. The coffee and latte were a bit average considering the prices. Free refills on the coffee at least."}
