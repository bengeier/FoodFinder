{"text":"Once enjoying my crisp cool water. Our orders were taken promptly, I ordered the chicken club and customized it with a side of coleslaw. My better half had the fish sandwich with a coleslaw as well. The food came like the wind, the coleslaw was damn good! The best. Our sandwiches couldn't have been better if Jesus himself made them. All around it was the bee's knees."}
{"text":"Real nice place. People nice and food great. Nice homemade salad dressings. On business so was a good choice. Will come back"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and one of the few benefits of that lifestyle is the opportunity to visit local restaurants. I usually stay away from places with less than 8 cars in the parking lot but there wasn't really any other place to eat aside from an Olive Garden, which isn't really food IMHO.  I decided to stop in and get my meal to go as I was fresh off of a construction site and my attire did not match the surroundings or the current clientele. I ordered a shrimp scampi appetizer and a fettucini fro diavlo. When I got the food back to the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised to find the order well packed with a salad and even a dinner roll. The shrimp scampi was excellent and my only complaint was that the shrimp had not been cleaned."}
{"text":"If you have the unfortunate opportunity to meet the owner you'll know why you're the only one sitting in the restaurant.  Food was average, expensive, and when I discussed an unfair charge the owner swore that if he was younger he'd fight me.  I'm pretty sure he only keeps it open as a hangout."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. The atmosphere is so relaxing and the staff are very personable and nice. Great service with top notch food. Family owned and the owners are always there to welcome you. Nice size restaurant which accommodates small parties. They offer a great Friday happy hour with half of drinks and appetizers. The pizza and onion rings are my favorite. Although everything on the menu is delicious. Located on Greentree road."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  The food is wonderful and the service is great.  I have never had a bad meal or a negative experience.  It is a gem!"}
{"text":"On a spontaneous drive from the Tanger Outlets, we took an exit, said that we'd stop at the first place we both hadn't eaten before. And Aracri's was the first place on the drive that we both hadn't dined at previously. Before being seated, we were able to glance at the menu and there was a wide range of things to order. It was almost a mix of fine dining and tavern eats. Our waitress seated us and helped us make decisions. There was a party occurring at a table in the middle of the floor while others were seated at booths including us. I was stuck between ordering the Blue Cheese Burger and Fish Sandwich, which our waitress recommended the burger accompanied by a glass of Pinot Noir. My friend ordered the buffalo chicken salad with a 22oz. Miller Light. My burger was pretty good. The fries that came with it were so fried crisply I thought they were sweet potato fries. The food wasn't amazing but it was good. Our waitress was great however; she periodically checked in and was very helpful and friendly. The atmosphere made for a good place to have deep conversation over drinks. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I can't say that I won't stop by again for a bite to eat and some drinks."}
{"text":"The food and service were very good . The food is made from scratch on premises . The restaurant is owned and run by two brothers from the Green Tree area . I admire this and always try to give my business to local family run places like this . My only gripes are the limited selection at the bar and I feel the prices for food are very expensive for the portions you receive."}
{"text":"Came in here just reading some reviews, figured, I'll give it a shot, they were good. I walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried, but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was. He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a success. So, not knowing what to order, because so many things looked yummy, he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine, OMG!!! DELICIOUS!!! AND he prepared it himself! I definitely, highly, recommend dining here when in the Pittsburgh/Greentree area. The reason for 4 starts not 5, the wine choices are lacking but the Red Rock Malbec was nice with the meal.  And Stephanie the bartender, super sweet and makes you feel like you're a regular. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Basic diner type food in an older, darker lounge set up. Seems to be a place where folks meet for a work lunch. I had the bunless hamburger with steamed broccoli (I modified their cheeseburger, and they were happy to customize it for me). It was good, but the ambiance was not my deal, but my server was super nice."}
{"text":"The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well, but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus, the staff was very nice and very attentive.   Management - you really need to update the place."}
{"text":"The owner and his employees are the best!!!  They are kind, friendly, and easy to talk with.  Also, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is the Best!!!  P.S. Don't get pickles on it!!!"}
{"text":"Love,love, loved their onion rings. The English style scrod is very good also. The Big Lebowski was on when we came here and people were dressed up like the movie's characters. It looks like a ski lodge on the inside. Service was acceptable."}
{"text":"This place looks old and incredibly dated, and sort of felt like it might have been a happening lounge in the 70's, but I dig that sort of thing. The menus say they were established in 67, and it's not hard to imagine they were the neighborhood \"fancy\" dining establishment back then. Food was decent and the staff was friendly. I have no complaints and I would probably eat here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"We checked this place out because it was close to our hotel and it was one of the few non-chain restaurants we saw.  The service was very friendly. The food was just okay.  I ordered the fettuccini alfredo with lump crab and they said the sauce is freshly made in house, but it sincerely tasted like it was out of a bottle.  It wasn't tasty/fresh enough to have been over $20.  The salad was just the typical iceberg lettuce salad."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday hour last Friday. Most appetizers half off, and drink specials like $5 wine by the glass...generous pour! We got to sit outside on the covered patio. Excellent quick service. My husband I split the fried zucchini and white pizza with chicken. Loved it, and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Drive on past all the chain restaurants in Greentree and drive into the Greentree Inn. True definition of an old school restaurant. Superb service and food. Waitresses and bartenders all greet you with a smile. The owners take pride in their restaurant and it is reflected in their food. Nice to see the owners walking around and asking how your dinner is. I've been there several times and I leave each time more impressed than the last visit. Appetizers are some of the best around. They have a happy hour with half off apps and beer/wine. Trust me you won't have a better onion ring anywhere! Owner told me the reputation of the onion rings put a roof on this place 50 years ago! Their steaks and seafood are all fresh. Owner showed me the ribeye from Weiss meats...huge!  My wife loves their tomato basil sauce and chicken Marsela. This evening we both had the Virginia spots ( a true Pittsburgh classic) for our dinner as they were the Lenten special. Melted in your mouth. I can go on and on but trust me this place is a classic. Don't be turned off by the old school decor. If you don't go your missing out! Not many old school places like this left. We need to continue to support these gems in our area before they are all gone. Keep up the great work Dino Frank and staff! Looking forward already to my next visit to sample something new! Heard they have a pizza that isn't on the menu that is awesome. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed going to a family owned restaurant.  Server was very pleasant and helpful.  I ordered a salad with their famous blue cheese dressing.  It was excellent.  Main dish was crab cakes with a side of broccoli.  Crab cakes were delicious!  Nice pieces of crab meat with very little breading.  Tarter sauce on the side was also homemade and tasty!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place"}
{"text":"Feeling peckish on the day before Easter, Kay and I utilized our holidays from our respective jobs to get some shopping done and to get lunch at a place I'd been neglecting to try, one that I've flew past more times than I know.   High ceilings, olden decor, antiques, and wooden beams caught my eye as I entered this 45 year old establishment, as did the portly gentleman(owner? manager? head cook?) wearing a deep blue t-shirt emblazoned with the visage of Walter Sobchak.   Minutes after we were seated, we saw someone dressed as Walter Sobchak.  As luck would have it, a screening of Joe and Ethan Coen's cinematic tour de force \"The Big Lebowski\" was taking place with many of our fellow, good-natured diners impersonating the quirky film's various characters. And this dude abided.  Starting us off was a helping of Aracri's \"famous\" Onion Rings, and they have a right to be famous considering their lightly battered, fried-to-bronze, not-overly-oily properties.  Considering we weren't out of the Lenten forest just yet, I decided to stay on Jesus' good side (And I ain't talkin' about Mr. Quintana. What would The Dude, do, anyway? He'd screw up like me and have lamb and chicken on Good Friday, testin' the Christman as if he'd really care if he walked the Earth today...) and order the Crab Cakes. Broiled expertly, served with tartar sauce, and generously stuffed with jumbo lump, each cake was as moist as a pumpkin pie, and neither possessed much in the way of filler.   The french fries were a bit limp and dark, a tell-tale sign that they were merely blanched once in boiling fat that was in need of being changed.   Also had was something emblematic of Middle America, a salad I hadn't eaten in a few years and never in a restaurant. An Iceberg Wedge Salad complete with bleu cheese dressing (not my favorite, but it was the only choice I was given) and bacon bits. For burps and chuckles I ordered it an was surprised at how much enjoyment I gained from breaking it down, making sure each forkful of fresh lettuce arrived in my mouth coated in the biting, milky dressing and fatty, crunchy, briny bacon, the tragically unheralded and sometimes derided salad succeeding through simplicity and tradition.   Dessert was a pecan ball slathered in whipped topping from a plastic tub and hot fudge that was irradiated in a glass jar (Smuckers be thy name?). It quelled my angry sweet tooth and little more.   Aracri's is one of those venerable suburban restaurants that deserves its longevity and its continued business, thriving on the standards and ignoring that which is trendy and new.   P.S. Wouldja believe I've never seen \"The Big Lebowski\" in its entirety? I guess I need to get on that. Until Netflix leads me towards enlightenment, this has always been my preferred Coen Brothers piece, standing as tall as John Goodman himself on my list of all-time cherished films...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AIfVoGUs6c"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 30 years or so.  Always good food at a good price.  Great service.  Nice variety."}
