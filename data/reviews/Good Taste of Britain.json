{"text":"Yes, at Good Taste of Britain you can find any British product like Mars bars, Smarties or cherry 7-Up..... They have these things for some reason, but they also have real British products like mushy peas, breakfast teas, flags, shirts & sweaters, pint glasses, old British television programmes (sic) and just about anything else British you're looking for. It's a small shop, but they probably even squeezed one of those mini-cars into the storeroom as a specialty item.... I like this place and enjoy my visits there to browse around. There's no doubt it will cost you more for these items, but it's not crazy and if you really want something you can't get anywhere else you'll pay it and not feel too bad about the whole thing. They really have an extensive collection of treats and everyday items, mixed with real specialty items only the true Brit would appreciate. But this place is definitely worth checking out just for fun. They also get British newspapers in on a daily basis. It's a great little shoppe......."}
{"text":"17/30  When I used to live across the street from Market Mall, Good Taste of Britain was where I would go to get my fix for Black Currant flavored goods, while getting \"Southgate 96\" by the Business stuck in my head. Ribena soda, Traveler's Sweets, etc. Cadbury candies reside here that are 3x sweeter than Cadbury candies anywhere else. Did you really need all of your teeth, anyway? This is also where I first tried out Walker's crisps, and buy lovely stocking stuffers of Haggis in a can and Spotted Dick pudding. If you stoop and giggle over the can long enough like a 3 year old, a kindly English lady will stoop over beside you and explain to you the proper method of how to heat and enjoy your can of Spotted Dick. Meanwhile your face will turn purple from trying not to giggle when she says, \"and really if you take the patience to warm it properly, Spotted Dick is so tasty.\"  If you think Haggis in a can is a terrible idea; fear not and rejoice. They also have frozen Haggis."}
{"text":"Ah the trip down memory lane.  Being born in London, England, any store that sells products from home is a frequent stop.  Good Taste of Britain is a chain of stores that focuses on selling items from Scotland, England, and Ireland, but mostly England.  Most people who are not from Great Britain may walk in and see familiar chocolate bars and wonder what the big deal is.  The difference between the chocolate bars you find in a regular store and the same brand you find here is in the chocolate.  You see, chocolate in Britain is made using different milk than what you'll find here.  As a result the taste is different, and for some, better.  I am one of those people who much prefer the chocolate made in Britain.  In addition to foods and treats, Good Taste of Britain also carries a selection of merchandise from overseas.  This includes an impressive selection of football jerseys (commonly called soccer here).  They also have a freezer containing some perishable items.  So the next time you're in Market Mall, pick up some crisps and a flake, grab a Liverpool jersey, and enjoy your day!"}
