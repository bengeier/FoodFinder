{"text":"This is a cute little sushi shop in the same mall as Metro Plus. It is not the best sushi, but it's not the worst. Cute decor inside, and the staff is honest and friendly.  The sushi chef has good maki-rolling skills, i.e. the rolls do not fall apart and are not too small or too big. Chef's choice sushi combo $15.95 is a good deal. I found the seafood miso soup to be too salty. Tempura was good but the panko batter made it more like katsu than tempura.   If you're craving sushi in the area, this is a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"Bof... nothing crazy here... I think it's popular because it's the only one. A sushi shop or sushi taxi would put this place out of business, gives you an idea of the sushi you can expect to get here. Expect to wait... lots of orders, lots of people waiting. Lots of people annoyed. Clearly a business opportunity for sushi in the city."}
{"text":"Very cozy inside, most people pick up but there's a few tables and a quiet ambiance. We ordered the green tea, which came in a pot with spices. For apps we ordered the seafood miso soup, and veggie tempura, in both the seafood was very Fresh. We then ordered the salad, which was quite big and had a delicious ginger/mayo dressing. For entrees we got the lobster tempura hot roll and their specialty winter roll. The lobster was good, but the winter roll was spectacular. The waitresses were sweet even though they didn't speak much English.  A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Très bons sushis.  Très bon rapport qualité/prix...  mais il faut dire que je prend toujours  mes sushis à la carte (donc fraîchement préparés) et non dans les petites boites dans le frigo (sushis préparés d'avance)...  On peut manger sur place mais la plupart des gens viennent y ramasser leur \"take out\" pour la maison.  Je recommande."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris des sushi en take-out. Tres bons et frais. Ne recherchez pas de petites sauces speciales, les ingrédients font le gout et c'est parfait si vius aimez le gout authentique du poisson et des mollusques. Excellent rapport qualité-prix. Endroit sans prétention, avec des sushi d'une  fraicheur assurée. ."}
