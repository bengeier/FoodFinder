{"text":"Really delicious food. the Quiche is unreal. also the pear salad is YUMMM"}
{"text":"They are serious. Really serious about serving good foods. You can tell if you dine here. 
I was in the area and stopped by based on other reviews. Gosh am I lucky to find this little gem. Everything I ordered was beyond my expectation. 
The best thing among all the delicious food I tasted was muffin. Crispy outside and moist inside. Perfect.

I can't wait to go back here soon."}
{"text":"What a great little breakfast spot! I'm so glad I stumbled on it. 

The decor was cute and cheerful and the service was attentive enough but not intrusive. But what I loved was the food and the pantry theme with everything in mason jars and (it seemed) made from scratch. I had the green shakshuka, my husband the smoked salmon, and my four year-old the yogurt and granola. He loved adding in the berries and granola himself.  It was tart plain yogurt so we added a little organic sugar. Every single thing as delicious. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I don't know the kosher scene too well but tagged along to Pantry with a friend who is observant of Jewish dietary laws. I'm so glad I kept an open mind because the food here is delicious! I'm vegetarian so I was very pleased by Pantry's massive meat-free selection (they do serve fish, however). The place is small but chock full of charming details like soup served in mason jars, artisanal glass water bottles and menus attached to clipboards. The atmosphere is bright, hip and unabashedly urban, a perfect spot to people watch along the bustling Bathurst corridor. 

Pantry's menu features massive portions of exceptional comfort food for grown ups. I indulged in a grilled cheese sammy on challah bread with apples and camembert which was simply phenomenal. I thought kosher meant dull, over-priced food but was pleasantly surprised by Pantry and would definitely come here again. The best kosher food I've had so far outside of Israel."}
{"text":"Top food. Healthy choices, great ingredients and cool atmosphere. Highly recommended. Try the salmon nicoise."}
{"text":"I'm super ticked off. I ordered from you guys on just-eat. 40 minutes later after you guys confirmed the order I'm being informed you are unreachable. Because of this stupidity I will 1 never order from you again, 2 not bother going to your restaurant. Irresponsible and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Went to an event that was catered by Pantry and the food was outstanding. Honey glazed smoked salmon bites on a stick tasted like it came straight out of an Alaskan stream. Sweet potato salad with feta is crunchy, sweet and salty all at once.  The various pastries and quiches were wonderful without feeling too heavy."}
{"text":"This place is one of the unassuming spots along Bathurst St. It's been on my radar for a while but could never find a reason to go in. Until my cousin recommended we go there for lunch today.

It's a small, casual interior with a busy counter and kitchen in the back. Fresh baked goods don the visual field.

The menu has between 20-30 items and cover soups, sandwiches, mains and salads. I ended up ordering one of their quiches and side salads. The salad was fresh with tons of crisp cucumber and tomatoes. Dressing automatically came on the side and was a nice, light vinaigrette. The quiche was also really light and fluffy with a flaky pastry crust.

The hot and cold drink menu is extensive and covers pretty much anything you can think of! With various sizes available. I ordered a cappuccino which was hot with a modest amount of soft foam on top.

Servers were attentive and did not rush you out. There was a steady stream of customers and I underestimated how busy it would be.

Downside: parking is a serious issue. I probably could have walked there in the time it took to circle the block enough times to find a parking spot. Also, pretty loud but nothing compared to its competitor a few blocks south.

Price point is reasonable. Restaurant appears clean and again food appears fresh. Definitely worth a try if you're going to be in that area of Bathurst."}
{"text":"Try this dairy kosher cafe if you want to try things that are slightly different! Everything on the menu is a bit atypical in some way. You may love it or it may not be your taste. Delicious desserts though that everyone loves. Great juices and smoothies. On ubereats. If u eat in there is sometimes a wait and not tons of space. But if you don't go at a busy time it's pleasant, if you like that open kitchen concept (not formal). The pierogies are my fav!"}
{"text":"This is a great dairly place for those with a sophisticated palate.

Prices are reasonable and you can get a variety of fresh items on the menu.  My favourite is the Anjou Pear and Goat Cheese Salad.

There is a small eat in area (about 16 seats) and a big open kitchen used mainly for catering and take out.  They also pickle their own veggies and make their own jams/Jellies.

The place is currently under supervision of COR."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my coworkers. 
I have been here before and the service continues to be slow and the food slightly over-priced. 
However it does taste good and is close to work. And they have more seating now which is great! 

I ordered the tuna melt off the special menu which had avocado, (imitation) crab meat, and salsa. It tasted really delicious (see photo) but was not as filling as I had hoped as the bread was well, \"flat bread\" rather than on a bun ha! Cost $16.50. 
The regular Tuna Melt is $13 and I'm not
sure that the \"special\" tuna melt warrants the extra $3.50. 

My friend ordered the \"burger\" and she enjoyed it even though the bread cut up the roof of her mouth lol. She's vegan thus it was perfect for her. 

I did ask for black pepper and was told we had some at our table when in fact we did not and the bus boy could not get me some when I pointed that out. 

Overall a good lunch options."}
{"text":"Got a bunch of their sufganiyot donuts...  While they looked quite appetizing, the dough had the consistency and taste of bread. And they were about $4 apiece.

Got a sandwich as well. The service was slow and the ingredients inside the sandwich were cold and bland. By the time they brought my side to the table I was already done the sandwich.

Restaurant is cramped, noisy, and dingy.

Waitress never brought water to the table."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant down the streett from work , Pantry.with my daughter. Neither of us are limited to kosher restaurants but heard they had great salads. The place was buzzing- could barely get a table-. It was cozy, small, but comfortably  trendy and hip- and an open kitchen in the back with lots of stainless steel.  The salads were the best  We had  grilled pear and Harvest- both out of this world. Dressing and combinations were fabulous not to mention the walnut brittle in the pear salad. Most of drinks and dressings were served inn little mason jars or bottles including the  ice cold water at the table. We didn't try the Shackshuka but it looked very appetizing too. I will definitely go there again but if I cannot stay they have takeout and even sell some of their salad dressings too"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best looking caf√© in town, far from there! Chop chop salad tasted good but way too expensive in general compared to other places in the same category."}
{"text":"I had some doubts coming into the restaurant as it doesn't look very inviting.  But once inside you can tell why everybody's raving about this place.

The place actually looks like a little cramped baker.  The seating is very, very, very limited - around 25 people max and there's a huge bakery/kitchen behind the counter.

At first I was a little upset as my friend and I choose to sit in one of the corners by the windows and the servers always got called before they reached us so it took around 15 minutes to place an order.  But when the server came he apologized and gave us excellent service for the rest of the meal.

The menu is fairly extensive and somewhat pricey but I swear it is soo worth it.  We ordered the Lucky Charm smoothie, the Tofu Steak Salad, and the Spring Alfredo with soup.  

The soup and the smoothie was okie dokies but the real deal came with the entrees.

The salad was amazing.  They did not hold back on toppings (unlike other restaurants that like to throw in a mushroom or 2 and then gives you enough leaves for a forest but calls it a specialty salad).  The portobello mushroom was huge, the tofu was a little pan-fried and gave the salad a slightly savoury taste.  The leaves were amazing and completely fresh (I do pick out brown leaves) but I didn't even sort through this one. They made their own sauce that really made the dish.

The spring alfredo was sooo creamy. I was amazed.  It's like they melted cheese for the sauce.  The asparagus they added was heavenly and cooked just right.  This dish was like a very high classed mac & cheese.  

I hate the fact that this is so close to work because now I'm coming here for all of my lunch meals.

Thanks for the great food & service."}
{"text":"Very nice place for brunch. I am not kosher but still appreciated this as a great little spot to stop. Had eggs and toast and my daughter had the yogurt and berries. All was good from food to service. All the meals going to other tables looked very good as well. Very small seating but cozy space."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch in this cute little cafe in bathrust.  

I enjoyed their food and brought home cookies for my sister and niece which they enjoyed.  

I would recommend this place.  Food is good, price is reasonable and the staff is friendly."}
