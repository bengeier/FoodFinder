{"text":"Great space! Love the decor and mugs they have there. You must visit and try their nutella latte and peanutbutter hot chocolate!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe combined with a clothing store. It used to be a cafe as well and the decor was nice back then too but they did a good job renovating the place!  I like their back patio - quiet, relaxing and comfortable. Not sure on weekends but it wasn't busy on a weekday. I had a latte and the taste was just average but it came in a very cute mug (antique looking?). Also the girl who was serving us was very sweet and definitely made us feel like coming back again!"}
{"text":"Completely by chance I stopped by this cafe on my way into work. The atmosphere was great and the drinks/food were delicious.   My only issue is that since then twice I have tried to stop by mid week (Weds and a Thurs) and they have been closed! I saw a guy locking up around 12:30 and he put up a sign saying he would be back at 1:30. Really? Its the middle of the day during the summer, prime time to be open! I would have loved to come in and spend my money, but out of frustration I have almost given up only making a point to go visit this cafe.  Definitely try it if  you haven't been before, but don't get your heart set on it!"}
{"text":"Fernando is a great guy, he made us a great cappuccino and very good pastries. We enjoyed a great music too. Me gusto el lugar."}
{"text":"Very nice high fashion clothing and accessory store here on good ol queen west. Great sales when they have them. Very hip items and great owners. They are friendly and helpful. Not to mention I love how they sell specialty coffees for very reasonable prices. They wrap everything u buy like a present."}
{"text":"My favourite weekend hangout! This Portuguese style cafe meets clothing store is a new addition to Queen West! The retail part is the designer clothing area - really cool, fun stuff (it's pricy, but great to  look at too). The cafe opens to Queen street. The music and ambience, coupled with the friendly, warm owners makes this an awesome hangout! Great coffee, yummy snacks (they don't serve full meals, just snack food), unique creative furnishings and a wicked back patio!"}
{"text":"'Twas a balmy and rainy spring afternoon and I had some time to kill before an appointment nearby. After browsing a few stores I stumbled into Citizenery. What a great pause of calm. Fado played in the background. Such a friendly married couple at the front--- the owners I presume? Groups of creatives sat around me, quietly planning shoots and costuming. I was solo and tasted their Nutella Latte, served under a doily, with a spoonful of Nutella presented across the cup, ($4.25) and a single savoury Portuguese pastry (they range from $1.00-1.80) served in a handwoven mini basket. There's also a big ol' patio in the back for sunnier days... Return of the Nat. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB1D9wWxd2w (imagine the Fado version though)"}
{"text":"What a beautiful cafe this is! By far one of the prettiest I've walked in to in Toronto. You're greeted by fancy dressed mannequins at the window, a wall of framed notes and a large framed set of pennies (yeah it's weird when I say it like that, but when you see it you will understand). The front half of this cafe-retail store hybrid is all cafe while the back houses some changing rooms and a real comfy looking couch. But don't stop once you hit the retail side of things as the back patio here is nicely hidden away from the bustle of Queen St. Unfortunately for me I came on a day with scattered showers in the area, so the patio furniture was not set up, but the patio is certainly spacious, definitely a great spot for an event (not sure if they rent it out though).   I had myself a latte (no latte art, but whatever right?), an americano, a cod fish cake and a custard gelato. All very delicious! My latte was not on the stronger side which I prefer, but my americano could have packed a bit more of a punch and still been OK. The fish cake was brilliant, they definitely did not skimp out on stuffing as much cod in there as possible and the custard came with a nice side plate of cinammon powder. You can order it with a side of ice cream too, or go for their coconut macaroon which comes with a good helping of chocolate sauce.   The retail side to Citizenry is pretty basic at the moment while small in area it is definitely charming, they carry women's only clothing from a designer in Portugal at the moment, but I was told that come September we should expect to see something in here for the men as well. I didn't check the price tags of any of the items, but something tells me they would be on the higher side of things.   A tiny detail I enjoyed was that they projected an old black and white film on the ceiling above the counter. I'm sure no one is expected to watch it but it was a touch I enjoyed.   I highly recommend checking out the Citzenry. They do have a small kitchen in the back but the largest food item I saw on the menu was an empanada, but while small in quantity, the variety of snacks here should be good enough to satsify you for a snack between meals. I also spied that they serve tea in a personal pot, so feel free to plop down for a good few hours, the music here (which I would assume to be Portugese) is definitely what I would expect to hear in a side cafe over in Portugal. There is free wifi, and while not all the seats have power outlets, you should be fine on that front assuming you grab the few seats that are electrically accessible.   The citizenry definitely catches the eye while walking past it. so next time you're in the area, don't just window shop, I suggest you come in and grab yourself a drink!"}
{"text":"Trying to escape a snowstorm, I stumbled across this shop on my way home. In particular, I was drawn to their small, but highly curated and exceptional selection of VERY well made European shoes from Portugal, as well as their handcrafted and architectural jewelry made from leather. The owners provided exceptional customer service and for what I ended up coming away with (2 pairs of boots and a beautifully minimal statement necklace), the prices were more than reasonable.  If you are someone who has a more progressive fashion sense and are looking to compliment that with tailored pieces and great quality leather...make this a stop on your way home."}
{"text":"its hard for mature 30 year olds to 40s etc to find a great bar with a dancefloor that doesnt make u f√®el ancient these days.  so im happy to report that a similiar crowd that used to go to brant house also goes to the citizenry.  the vibe is awesome everyone just wants to let loose and blow off steam from a busy workweek.  im happy to see this place exists and definately recommend for a girls night, a bacheloette party and a fun time.  though i have not tried the food the drinks were decent and my friend and i had a great night"}
{"text":"We just happened to be walking by and this place caught my attention. I just had this vibe that this place was going to be awesome. The outdoor patio in the back is so chill and the indoors is a hip designer store/portuguese cafe. I know, you're thinking, jeez, another boutique/portuguese cafe!? But it's totally amazing. The guy working the counter even plays the guitar for your enjoyment.  PS. the juice/tea drinks are DIVINE."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Citizenry. I saw the amazing reviews and had to stop in myself while staying in Toronto. Fernando, one of the owners, was so kind and such a great conversationalist. It was like talking to an old friend. I had the almond butter mocha and .... wow. It is everything and more. I agree with the previous reviews that the dishware is so charming. I ended up getting the Nutella latte to go because I knew I wouldn't be able to come back before I left the city and I had to try it (haven't yet taken a sip because I just left, but I had to write a review!). The outdoor seating is wonderful and spacious. Hats off to Fernando and his wife. Your cafe/store is beautiful and would easily be my favorite if I was a native to Toronto."}
{"text":"This intriguing boutique on Queen W drew me in after I glimpsed clothes that did not bore me. I window shop like a pro and pretty much pass by the majority of boutiques if I'm not jiving with what's \"on trend this season\" (read: the rule not the exception). But Citizenry got me past the threshold with its enticing offerings in the windows *and* there's the fact that they have a sweet little coffee set-up as well. How could I resist?  But it gets better. I loved a lot of what I saw in the front (nothing tragically trendy, excellent prices) but it was what was waiting for me in the back of the store that really got me ready to whip out my credit card and break my \"no shopping in the summer because I have to save my $ for fall\" rule. In the back is where you're going to find the stuff that makes you go \"ahhh.\" Must. Have. There's corsets. There's dresses that you won't see anyone else wearing (and there is probably only one of each item). There's jackets and more. I'm babbling. I always babble when I'm indescribably happy. Young, up and coming designers prevail back here and I wanted all of it.   Oh the exquisite skirts with all kinds of bells and whistles... The one that attracted me to her has strings in it so that you can gather it up on either side and look like a chic post modern saloon girl. Unfortunately, my budget did not allow for an entire new wardrobe, even with these unbelievably low prices (low for one of a kind items and expertly crafted corsets, not \"low\" as in cheap), so I decided on that skirt and a silky jacket with a bunch of zippers that allow you to adjust the length and whether or not you want to wear it as a vest. So fucking cool! I have too many corsets (yeah, it's true) and was *trying* to be practical that day, but oh how I wanted to have a go with some of these little numbers. I'll be back. that's a promise. In fact I'll be back in less than a month.   And the owner is just the best. He's helpful and makes suggestions, offers you espresso and good conversation.   Citizenry might be my favorite place to shop in the world."}
{"text":"I stopped into Citizenry for a coffee and to use the internet for a bit. The atmosphere/decore is fantastic. Fernando made me a wonderful americano, and the spinach/cheese pastry was very tasty. The attention to detail and commitment to sourcing quality garments is obvious.  It's really wonderful to find a boutique that is a comfortable place to hang out, and run by such great people!"}
