{"text":"The restaurant just started serving dinner on Weds through Saturday.  The deck and restaurant have some of the best views in town.  Great place to enjoy a sunset.  Food is great and reasonably priced.  Menu varied from steaks to lighter fare."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day brunch later afternoon. Disappointed with set up and quality of food. The advertisement in the local paper was very misleading. Not one fresh strawberry in the \"fresh strawberry shortcake.\" Strawberry's seemed like they were from frozen and other fruits were from a can. The only fresh fruit I saw on the buffet was watermelon. So much for the advertised seasonal fruits and salads. The green leaf salad was wilted and sad. The buffet was set up in a pass through hallway which was narrow and awkward for guest and staff. Only one waffle maker and redi whip in a can to top it off.  The decor is  old & tired. Be careful when sitting on the patio, there is a birds nest with \"droppings\" running down the wall next to a table set up....yuck!"}
{"text":"Quick, very affordable summer menu served 10-2 daily. Ice cold $2.00 drafts from 11-2 EVERYDAY"}
{"text":"Brunch with a view. Eggs Benedict is the highlight, nice variety at reasonable prices. Just good food! Xlnt Happy Hour.  JD"}
{"text":"Staff cordial and very friendly. Had a great BLT. Beautiful view of the golf course. They even accommodated a special request to make 1/2 sandwich. Everyone should give it a taste test."}
{"text":"Service was good considering Friday night fish fry. We requested medium rare steaks and they arrived well done.  When asked how our meal was we offered our honest opinion.  Later in the evening we were confronted by someone we assume was \"chef\". He made us so uncomfortable we left immediately.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"the fat bald guy leasing the restaurant is a jack ass loud mouth and treats the employees like crap, all while running around blabbing his fat mouth about making 100k  - he has also shorted hours on employees paychecks and driven away customers because he really has no clue how to treat people or create a good restaurant atmosphere  -  like the actual owner of the golf course / restaurant he has employed his family only to teach them how not to do a good job when it comes to actually doing he work and treating the staff like crap - zero communication skills - zero professional ism in doing their jobs - his food really is not that good unless you are a trucker .. then its just over priced  -  - i am just sick of restaurant owners in fountain hills who put out bad product and treat ppl like shit and truly have no integrity in what they are doing... 'cept to make their greedy fat ass a few bucks"}
{"text":"The latest reviews are a couple of years old, so let me share what this, place is like now.  This is a casual, unpretentious bar and grill at the Desert Canyon golf course. No pretense, no fancy linen, just good food at a reasonable price.  I had the prime rib and it was excellent!  The views are wonderful.  This is my second visit and I'll be back soon with my friends."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers in Fountain Hills. At lunch today. Great food, excellent fish fry all day on Friday"}
{"text":"This is one of those diamond-in-the-rough places in Fountain Hills.  We went for the first time this weekend.  The food was delish, drinks were tasty, the service was great, and the views of the golf course and mountains from the comfortable chairs on the wraparound deck were spectacular.  I understand that they recently updated their outside deck and it shows.  'Tis the season for dining outside, so we are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner at the DC Bar and Grill last night.  Hard to believe there was only a handful of people there besides us, as the view was outstanding, and it was such a gorgeous evening to be eating \"al fresco\" on the large patio with comfortable seating.  My husband had a steak sandwich with fries, and I had a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings.  Both were delicious.  We also had a glass (or two) of the house merlot and house cabernet.  The prices here are so reasonable, you really can't go wrong.  What a gem in Fountain Hills!  We are looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I love the views but the menu needs desperate help, very over priced for the lack of food you get.  I ordered the chef's salad expecting a big salad with all the fixings which I received looked like dog food thrown in a bowl made with iceberg lettuce.  It was a little bowl with maybe a cup of iceberg lettuce not mixed lettuce like the menu says with pieces of egg and some meats thrown it.  Looked more like a dollar salad for a baby not something with a $9.00 price tag.  Very overpriced.  Best time to go is in the summer months when they have their $5.00 lunches.  Now they want you to pay over $10.. for a $5.00 burger. ....Go for the view and bring a bagged lunch."}
{"text":"Best Sunday breakfast bunch with a view!!  Different choices all the time so coming every week is fun!!"}
{"text":"You can't go too far wrong if you like a killer view for your brunch!  A mimosa comes with the price and food is very good, tho not fancy.  No prime rib or shrimp, just a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Tim has a new Summer Menu, which is great.  We had the prime beef last Saturday evening and it was very good ($12.00 includes mash potatoes and dinner salad )...we all had mud pie, which was great. We be returning for their great fish fry on Fridays....$8.00. The Brunch on Sundays is also good... You get great a menu with some of the best views in Fountain Hills !!"}
