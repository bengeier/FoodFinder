{"text":"Great tasting lamb gyros, good service and reasonable price. What else could someone ask for in a mall? If you're looking for something different, tasty and quick give them a try."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Greek place in Chandler  (MedFresh #1 in Tempe). I have tried the chicken shawarma plate several times, and every time it's been consistently delicious. I also love the falafal. I've tried falafal before that was dry, overcooked, bland. Their version is moist and flavorful! The best part is the sauces. One sauce for the falafal, one AMAZING garlic sauce for the shawarma chicken. So good! The rice is always on point as well. I have 4 stars because the service always seems to be \"cranky\" or bored/annoyed. Better customer service would make this place perfect IMO. Please support this local business!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I REALLY REALLY LIKED THIS PLACE.

We loved the quick and easy service. The cashier/person who took our food was super nice. It seemed like the managers (owners?) were all there too, and it really, REALLY, seemed like they genuinely cared about their product and service. It was very noticeable.

The food was very tasty. It tasted super fresh and flavorful. I appreciate the fact that they keep their sauces easily accessible to the customers too.

The price was great too. We got two pita combos, with a side, and a drink for all less than $20. Oh, and I love that you can pick different sides too! They don't just stick you with fries (if you don't want them, lol)."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who works at the food court told me about this new place so I went to try it today. I ordered the chicken kabob, once I paid I stood up there waiting to come up. Then I saw a guy in the back making my kebabs in a real grill, wow, that was a good sign for me, once done he brought it to me and when I opened it I found a complete meal with a little bit of everything, a yellow rice, raw white onions,tomatoes,cucumbers, grilled chicken and 4 pieces of pita bread. The chicken was very tasty, the rice was a little bit dry with no salt (but it has potential) the raw veggies had no dressing at all (I don't know if they are supposed like that of if they forgot to do it) and the pita bread was ok, to be honest I have tasted better ones. However; I might give them another chance later ;)"}
{"text":"Some good things, some not so good, and bottom line is that my gyro was not so good. The good part is that they provided plenty of meat (lamb) and it was cooked well, was tender, and not greasy. And they lived up their name by delivering at food court speed. The bad part is the overall taste. In particular, what passed at tzatziki was bland, thin, and runny, and I think they just passed the essence of cucumbers over it. Not many tomatoes or onions for the double-sized plate that I ordered. Very filling and inexpensive, but not a gustatory treat."}
{"text":"The chicken kabob with rice is very tasty. Ask for a side of taziki sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Our go to whenever we have a craving for gyros. Which seems to be weekly! :x The girl at the counter is always friendly and super sweet. She always offers us water. Doesn't matter if it's super busy or not, you can usually get your order in a timely manner. Food is consistently great, I always ask of extrar tzatziki sauce to dip my fries in. I'm sure there are many other items on the menu that fare just as well as the gyros but like the saying goes, if it ain't broke why fix it? :D"}
{"text":"Had the falafel pita, tabbuli, hummus, and Chicago dog. Unfortunately, the falafel was the only saving grace. The tabbuli was too soggy/sweet, hummus was too bland, and the Chicago dog was just a little nasty. The falafel was very very good though, and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here several times, and I'd say it was good 75% of the time. The gyros are the best dish, especially the gyros they make with the jalape√±os. They prepare the food very quickly, and the service was decent as well."}
{"text":"Ok, so my food was rather good.  Humus was decent, pita was warm and toasty and the Gyro was seasoned well.  HOWEVER, its a HUGE turn-off when your standing there ordering food and the person taking the order is picking at a sore or IDON'TKNOWWHAT! on their arm!   
If I wasn't so damn'd hungry I would have walked out!"}
{"text":"great food! I love the Firefighter pita...always order the same each visit. I forgot the pistachio baklava is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I am new to AZ. I have been here, from NYC for 4 months. I can honestly say, the gyro I had, was the best tasting food and most enjoyed meal, I have had, since leaving NYC."}
{"text":"Great gyros!! Best I've had in a while. Only downside is they're a little too big to eat comfortably. Quite messy. Very casual seating-minimal seating at that."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Gyros Express.  I eat there at least 3 - 4 times a week.  Their large Greek salads are to die for.  All of the ingredients are super fresh and the dressing that they use is a perfect compliment.  My friends usually get a salad with chicken but I go \"off road\" with beef souvlaki.  Beef souvlaki is my favorite meat at Gyro's Express.  While beef souvlaki salad does not officially appear on their menu, they will make it for you if you ask them.  Their beef souvlaki gyros are really excellent too as are their regular beef gyros (number 1 on the menu).  I would highly recommend Gyro's Express for delicious fresh food that is served quickly by very friendly staff.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My coworkers and I make a weekly lunch trip and we've had a wonderful experience EVERYTIME. I have also had dinner there a couple times.

The staff, cleanliness and food is incredible! Consistancy, consistancy, consistancy!!

Everything I have tried on the menu has been very tasty and worth ordering again.  The shawerma plate with rice and the chicken salad are my recommendations!

You know a place is delicious and worth eating at when you have to wait for a table no matter what time of the day it is.

 p.s. The homemade baklava is a MUST!"}
{"text":"My boss treated us to Gyro Express yesterday, and I am a fan! He got us all gyro pitas with greek salads. The greek salad was mediocre (waaaay too seasoned - oregano maybe?) but the pita was fantastic. The meat is perfectly seasoned, the pita tasty and warm and the tzatziki, while a bit watery, was great. We had some extra gyros so I am eating the second one today, and warmed up and it's just as good. I don't know if it's the best Greek around (I've only had Dino's and a place in STV to compare!) but I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious pita sandwiches. They taste authentic to me, but I'm not Greek, so not an expert. Prices are $6-$12. Yum! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the 1st time today, ordered to-go. The place was completely empty- which should always be a red flag. Girl at the counter was very friendly, sweet and accomodating.

My order: combo appetizer (falafel, baba, hummus and dolmas), side of basmati rice, side of tzatziki. Got home and found I was given a side Greek salad instead of the rice...salad looked like it was made in the to-go container days ago: lettuce limp/brown, tomato/onion/cucumber on top all dried around edges...didn't eat any of it. 

CONS:
- Falafel tasted good, but was the consistency of Play-Doh and very dry.
- Dolmas were complete mush inside
- Baba felt like it bubbled in my mouth, which was bizarre- not sure it was fresh- though the few bites I took did taste good. Couldn't get past that weird fizz.
- Where is my rice?!?! (perhaps my fault for not looking at the order before I left...but I shouldn't have to).

PROS:
- Hummus & Tzatziki were great- neither was too garlicy
- Pita was good and very fresh
- Friendly staff
- Restaurant appeared very clean

Would not recommend unless you're looking for nothing other than pita and hummus. I find it hard to believe entrees/meats would be any more fresh than the items I ordered today. Disappointing."}
{"text":"A shwarma place in Chandler...... excellent.  Food is quite tasty for a little tiny hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"I have gotten the Gyro and fries severl times here, and each time its great.  The place is small but the Lamb Gyro has lots of meat and is cooked well.  I would recommmend this place, best Gyros I've found in Chandler so far."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this place for a few months now, and it's probably as good as you can get for fast-food style Greek cuisine. The gyros are great, but my personal favorites are the souvlaki and shawarma, which I highly recommend.

My only real complain is that the service can be a little slow, so I'd recommend calling ahead if you're in a rush. There have been times that I've been the only person in there and still ended up waiting 15+ minutes for my food, which seems a little excessive. Otherwise, fantastic place."}
{"text":"A really good tasting gyro! And they don't skimp on quantity. This is one to keep on the list."}
{"text":"I was driving by and saw this place. Decided to stop by and I think it was the worst decision I ever made. The beef was burnt on the outside and completely raw inside. Also the beef was so rubbery you couldn't even bite through it. The chicken was pretty good. The tzatziki was horrible. Hummus was alright (not the best I've ever had)."}
{"text":"I liked this place so much I joined Yelp just to review it. This greek restaurant is actually owned by Greeks (gasp!). They have the best gyro pita sandwich in town and awesome french fries with generous portion sizes. My wife and I also split the giant gyro salad that comes with pita bread on the side. Don't be put off by the vanilla atmosphere, if you like greek food then try out this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I usually get the Gyro salad.  It's a large salad with generous portion of gyro meat on top.  It also comes with pita and gyro sauce.  Little over $10.

My other choice is Gyro sandwich combo.  It's also little over $10.  It comes with gyro sandwich, fries, and a drink.  

Both are fantastic!  I would highly recommend.  It does get busy during lunch so don't be surprised if you end up waiting 10-15 mins for the food to comes out.  Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I heard about the large gyro meat portions on the platter and I had to check it out. The meat portions were huge and the Greek salad was delicious.  The pecan baklava was fresh and flaky, no overly sweet which I loved. French fries were hot and crispy. Friendly woman taking our order...big smile.  Overall really good food hot, tasty and reasonably priced!'"}
{"text":"This place is a winner!!!, walked in the lady at the front was super polite, the place was clean, service was fast, food was fresh, and delicious definitely going back multiple times!!!"}
{"text":"Come for lunch only! Once the sun goes down you never know what will be available since they always stop cooking menu items, I guess to get out early.  On multiple occasions I have gone here and item after item is \"out.\"  Why not close doors earlier? Why claim your open till 9 if by 7 you're out of key items?! I've had it! I just walked out this last time and I'll recommend others to not waste your time here. Absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"So the reason for the the 3 stars was the hummus needs more flavor lacks garlic and lemon. The baba ganoush was ok. The falafel was good and the domas were ok needs more flavor"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch during the week. The place is no fancy, but it was darn good. Fairly crowded, but typical quick serve type place. 

I opted for the falafel salad and a side of hummus. Turned out to be way more than I could eat. The falafel was really good. Some places tend to over cook it and it gets really dry. This was cooked to perfection. Also, came with a side of tahini sauce. 

Would recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered take out last week for the first time and the food was good.  I had the veggie pita and Greek salad and my husband ordered the Greek salad with Gyro meat. We also ordered the hummus and pita, we should have ordered another because my boys are almost all of it!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and pleased with the food and service both times. The gyros are very good. The service was excellent both times Tory was extremely friendly on each occasion."}
{"text":"The food was ready within minutes! I got the chicken shawarma and fries which came to about $9 and change. The French fries are from frozen though, and not fresh. The chicken gyro was tasty but a little dry. They forgot to give me the shawarma sauce so I had to go back. I probably will come back and give them another chance but I would get something completely different."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and unfortunately this is not the place to get it. Steak shawarma was dry and tasted like the meat had been reheated at least 5 times. Gave them a second try and was still disappointed with the quality and lack of effort by the kitchen. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is the best gyro in Chandler.  If you like a friendly staff who will be real with you and also take care of you, then you will love this place.  

The best part:  the young lady who works the front during afternoons and nights.  She does it all plus she puts a smile on my face every time.

I recommend the gyro with the rice."}
{"text":"Way better than your typical mall food!

I had the gyro with rice with extra meat. The meat portion was more than generous! It wasn't the most succulent gyro meat but pretty darn good and about the same as Parthenon on State. 

The tzatziki sauce was thick but delicious. The rice was just okay. 

The sauce selection out front is not custom sauces but a hot sauce (probably Franks), and a BBQ sauce (probably Heinz) and a \"mild\" sauce that tasted like a mild Franks."}
{"text":"I don't live in the area, so I cannot eat here all the time.  I do come to this establishment when I am in the area for my oncologists appointments every 6 months to my Gyros fix.  These Gyros are filled with meat that tastes great and the Pita bread is soft and hot as well.  You will definitely find that it's a filling meal."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall location for a quick Gyro Sandwich. 

I ordered the typical Gyro and Fries. I it was very good. Could have used a little more sauce, but other than that it was a nice little quick lunch."}
{"text":"By far the best gyro and hummus, ever.  I've been eating here for years and have never been disappointed.  Everyone I recommend it to winds up raving about their food.

Friendly service, good prices and excellent food.  A very happy customer :)"}
{"text":"I like coming here - they have great portions on salads and are super generous with the meat (I'm not exaggerating either).  Their Greek salad always has plenty of crispy, green romaine and is topped with a lot of fresh color veggies, olives and a nice amount of feta.  Trust me, a big Greek salad here is VERY filling.

I have not tried their pitas, but I have tried their Kefta and I like that the guy makes it fresh (ie. he tells me it'll be a few minutes of wait because he's making them fresh) - which I appreciate.

The price point is perfect for a regular lunch spot, too.

My ONLY complaint is that when I have gotten the salad, I have gotten the pita bread slices that come with it and maybe I'm just not used to that type of pita bread, but it's kinda 'americanized'.. very non-nutritious looking.  But that could be just me.  I guess I'm used to the ones from Haji Baba that you can actually slice open and stuff.. they're more fibrous and seem to have more nutritional value.  Other than that, I will always stand by their salads."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Chandler! 

Pita are soft, warm, and fresh. Salads are amazing! They treat you like family here, fast and friendly. Everything I have tried has been phenomenal, CAN'T WAIT for the 2nd location to open near Ikea on Warner & Priest."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  (Out of sheer laziness..)

Their gyros are ok.  They give you a good portion, but I wouldn't really rate their food as anything more than average.

I usually judge places like this by their chicken shawirma, much like I judge a sushi bar by their spicy tuna rolls.  The difference between their chicken shwawirma and the same dish from a better restaurant is like the difference between L&L's chicken katsu vs. Aloha Kitchen's chicken katsu.  Aloha kitchen's chicken katsu is FAR superior."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh sliced gyros, excellent Greek rice, fresh salads, all the fixings included."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I have had since moving to ARIZONA!!!!! I went to get take out tonight for my family. I has very impressed that the rice is not instant which is usually the norm for Mediterranean takeout. The falafel was amazing, I usually will only eat falafel that I cook. My husband's gyro was full of meat and lettuce is not used as a filler. I will be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"For a mall place this is absolutely great.

To be honest I've been waiting for this place to open up since they've announced it and I was not disappointed. The prices are cheap ($6 for a giant gyro, $6 for a 4 pc fried chicken meal with fries) and the food is above average for sure. I agree with Rose that the gyros do not seem as greasy as other gyros that I've had, which makes the food taste slightly lighter. I have yet to try the other items of their extensive menu with everything from Italian beef sandwiches and burgers to chicken gyros and kebabs (with fried okra and fried chicken being next on my bucket list). Sure, it's not fine dining, but for a few bucks this is as good as mall-based fast food gets.

It's only been a week since they've opened. I imagine they'll do well. Just hope they don't jack up the prices or start being stingy with the prices. The guys there are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I first learned of gyros when I lived in Germany. They were good... and cheap there.

I lost touch with my gyro side for a few years then saw this little baby nuzzled inbetween a few shops over by a friend's house. Why not... after all, he also lived in Germany and liked gyros.

Thir food is pretty good. Not as good as the ones I've had in Europe, but good. I think the best one I've had is the pork one. the other ones have been so-so. I've not the biggest fan of the crinkle fries that come with the meal. I would say that they might put a little too much lettuce on their sandwhiches because normally when I am done I have a little mini-salad to eat from all the stuff that has fallen out.

But then again, maybe I am just a slob.

My friend that I mentioned above loves the place, so he'd probably give it a 4-star."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this place has Gyros. It offers lamb and chicken gyros, hot dogs, baklava, double cheeseburgers, and pizza puffs. The Gyros here are pretty good (they're less greasy than at Athens!)."}
{"text":"Thought because they have the same exact menu as King of Gyros in Tempe that it would be just as good.... I was wrong, King of Gyros was sooooo good that it made this mediocre food taste bad. Fries had a pool of oil at the bottom, we asked for no onions or tomatoes and got both, gyro meat was paper thin while at King of Gyros it's nice and thick. Overall the food is ok, the service is pretty good besides messing up the order, and the price is cheap but a much better restaurant 5 minutes away has much better food for the same price."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!!! I LOVE this place!!! The gyros are packed with delicious meat, the hummus and pita are always on point too! Don't forget about the often overlooked pizza puff, it's so good. 

The food is a good bang for your buck.  The people are always friendly! Definitely recommend Gyro Express!!"}
{"text":"Extra star for the owner contacting me and offering me a compensation meal at his Tempe location. Girl at the counter was also fired according to Ed."}
{"text":"This is my first time try Greek food and it was great! I ordered lamb gryo with salad and French fries for $8.34 in total. There is so much lamb and I love lamb! The bread they put underneath is soft and tasty as well. Gryo is yummy and in good price, and you can get Frenchfries for 1.99 and soda for 0.99. I enjoy my Greek lunch with GryoExpress."}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had, hands down. Fresh, flavorful, thinly sliced meat on a warm, fresh pita.  I have tried gyros at many local greek spots and they just don't stack up to Gyros Express.  My only complaint...the fries are nothing to write home about and I wish they offered rice as a side in addition to the current options of salad or fries. However, the name of the place tells you their specialty. They also have my favorite Gold's Peak Green Tea. Rock on, Gyros Express! I have found my go-to spot for a cheap Greek meal."}
{"text":"Since my last rating I have ventured out to even more items. I love the Chicken Souvlaki. The Plate is a great deal. Better than the Pita Meal. You get a lot of meat, a salad, side and a drink all for a few bucks. Get a Combo or Supreme Plate and have enough to eat for lunch and dinner. 

I eat her sometimes 3 times a week. And I see a lot of the same faces every time. Lots of people eat here many times a week. 

On a diet, get a salad with your favorite meat. Small or Large.

It's not fancy but it's good and it's inexpensive. 

Every week a friend and I meet for lunch and get a Supreme Combo Plate. Chicken Souvlaki, Hummus, Chicken Shawarma and Kofta Kabob. Add and extra pita and an extra drink and it's less than $20 bucks."}
{"text":"Everything was good.  Our first time and we got fire fighter gyro my husband loved it, came with a salad and drink.  My kids had a Philly cheesesteak and it was delicious and I had chicken Slovakia plate.  Everything was delicious I am def coming back"}
{"text":"Good place for mediterranean food. I tried the kefta and it was great. My friend recommended the falafel as well. The only reason i would give it a 4 is because i am from Lebanon and well i guess i have very high expectations when it comes to Lebanese food. But definitely recommend it and worth a try!"}
{"text":"Greek Salad  is so sour and caused my stomach to react. Not a good kind of salad if you don't like super sour dressing. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Not bad but not super, cafeteria quality Greek food, a little soggy, but dessert was great."}
{"text":"Best Greek in town!!! This place has become our weekly favorite. I find myself craving everything here and it  is always worth the drive from Gilbert without disappointing."}
{"text":"I was moderately happy with my order here. I ordered baklava and the veggie plate which comes with grilled seasoned tomatoes, green pepper, shredded carrots and onion, and rice. The baklava was pretty good, your typical baklava. The veggie plate was ok, but a little too vineger-y / pickled for my taste. I don't know how they prepared the vegetables but it was just a little too acidic for me. It probably would have been a good side to a main dish but was too overwhelming for an entree."}
{"text":"Food quality and quantity is superb, with fast service every time. This is our \"little Middle East\" where we come together and feast!!"}
{"text":"We would not go back.  Got a chicken salad and gyro plate.  The combo appetizer (dolmas, falafel, hummus and baba ganoush and a baklava.

Meat was very dry in both dishes.
Hummus and dolmas had no flavor - extremely bland.  Stuffed dolmas tasted like plain white rice with no flavoring.  Hummus didn't even have a bean flavor to it.  

Baba ganoush felt a little slimy and again very bland - it took me several bites to figure out what it was despite being more chunky and was the one item we left on the plate because of the texture.

Baklava was dry and dough tasted over cooked.

So while food was edible there was nothing pleasurable about it."}
{"text":"I love a great gyro but too often I go somewhere and it's anything but great. The lamb gyro here was huge, flavorful and excellent. I loved the sauce that went on it and was surprised by how much meat they put in their gyros. Highly recommended the service was excellent and very friendly as well and good was ready quickly."}
{"text":"I have never seen a Gyro restaurant in a shopping mall's court yard before... so of course I ate here! I ordered the Gyro Burger and noticed a tray of baklava (naturally, I ordered one of those as well). Now, the only problem I had with Gyro Express was that I didn't feel like my food came in an 'express'-like manner. It was slow and in a food court... slow is BAD! But, I saw them cut meat off the roast, so I know my meal was fresh to order (is that the correct phrase?). The only other place in that food court that takes a while to complete your order is Steak Escape.

The Gyro Burger was outstanding, if I wasn't in a hurry... I'd say it was 'worth the wait.' Now, that baklava... that was AH-Mazing! It was a huge piece, first of all. It was delicious, second of all. And third of all, the pastry portion was flaky. It may have been the best baklava I've ever had and will definitely entice me to stop back for more (even if that ends up being the only reason... a craving for baklava)."}
{"text":"The gyro- what a tasty treat!  If I had to give any criticism is that you may want the salad dressing on the side.  I fine they put far too much on their salads."}
{"text":"Gyro Express is a pretty decent hole-in-the-wall lunch place. Its always packed, which is easy to accomplish with only a total of 5-6 tables. The style is very much fast food-like: its made very quickly, kind of greasy and it has a small menu of all the classic Greek favorites which get ordered, paid and picked up from the counter. 

Now I can't say that everything tastes super fresh and made to order like some of the Valley favorites (Haji Baba). However, I doubt that's what Gyro Express is all about. For what they try to be (a fast, tasty and affordable Greek place), Gyro Express really hits the spot. Their classic gyro is decently sized, the meat is delicious and the sauce (and added hot sauce) make it the perfect combo. Their Greek fries (aka french fries with feta, lime juice and some parsley) are freaking phenomenal. The food wait time is minimal and the food comes out exactly the same every single time, which is great when you need some quick and tasty lunch food you can depend on.

Get extra napkins. You'll need it unless you want to end up with sauce everywhere."}
{"text":"Seriously, these guys make an awesome Gyro sandwich!
If you ever go to the so called Greek places, and they put lettuce on their Gyron, run screaming. Excellent Kronos gyro meat and perfect tsatziki on a fresh warm pita, the god's will have to ask you...\"you lika da juice?\""}
{"text":"We love Gyro Express!  The food is pretty cheap and quick for lunch.  You just order at the counter, and you grab your food when they call your number.  They have seating inside and a couple of tables outside for when the weather is nice.  They also have a TV inside the shop that is usually showing football or soccer.

The food is really good.  We love the chicken shawarma plate which comes with hummus and Greek salad.  The chicken gyro is also pretty good.  The hummus is really yummy, and the Greek Salad is full of fresh lettuce and olives.

The wait is usually nonexistent even at lunch.  The staff is just really efficient.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I love Greek food.  Don't know if the ownership is Greek or middle eastern, but as long as the food is good, I don't care.  We went for lunch this past weekend and were happy.  Wifey had the grilled chicken Greek salad and she liked it.  The dressing was a little weak and could have used more olive oil and better red wine vinegar, but the salad was good.  The pita bread was excellent too.  I had the kofta plate.  The two koftas I got were very good and the garlic sauce and the tzatziki sauce were also good.  Rice was good, but could have been cooked in a little more flavorful broth.  I got salad too and I would say the same thing about the dressing.  All-in-all we were satisfied.  Not cheap and the price is on-par with other Greek restaurants, but I was not disappointed.  Next time I will try the gyros since I love good gyros!"}
{"text":"First walking into this establishment the staff was very welcoming and helpful. It was dinner time and busy, now I know why, the food was excellent. We ordered a Steak Shawarma plate and a Chicken Shawarma salad. Both orders were fresh and tasty, perfect amount of spices, also, serving portions were more than enough..which means leftovers. Furthermore, we ordered hummus as an appetizer and bought baklava for dessert. If you're going somewhere else, turnaround because you're missing out! 

Can't wait to go back and try other options on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I go here atleast once a week.  I am not fond of their salads, they're very sour. However,  their lamb gyro (the #1), is delicious.  The staff is friendly and attentive. It's my favorite lunch establishment!"}
{"text":"Very hungry and was not particular.  I ordered the gyro pita. The meat was fattly (gristle) and cold. The tzaziki sauce was sour and veggies sparse.  I do not recommend this restaurant (even if your very hungry..:). Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"I wasn't looking forward to eating at this place and was blown away.  The place was PACKED and the cashier said it is always that way.  I heard customers talking as if they eat here several times per week.  I ordered the vegetarian pita sandwich with a greek salad and drink.  The only negative was that the drink tasted funky.  At first I thought it was the fresh brewed tea that I got - maybe it was fresh or had some mold in it but I dumped it out and got diet Dr. Pepper and it had the same moldy taste.  Perhaps it was the ice?  Anyway it was way to much food for me so I will skip the salad (even though it was good!!) and just get the sandwich.  I wanted to go again last week but the kids got sick.  I will eat one this week.  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Good quality but garlic sauce needs some work. descent portion size ;) the salad was pretty good and same for the overall meal. I am just a garlic sauce lover and I wish that could be more garlicky... besides that the foods pretty healthy"}
{"text":"I was hoping for another good place to get Gyro's in Chandler, and after reading all the reviews I thought this sounded like a good place. I just went in for lunch today to give them a try. After reviewing their menu I found they offer Italian beef sandwiches as well, and that is one of my favorite things. So instead of the Gyro I ordered the Italian beef Chicago style, which means dipped in the juices and with peppers. When I got home and opened the sandwich I was VERY disappointed to find a small dry sandwich with no peppers, and very little meat. The meat was dry and had very little flavor. They forgot the peppers, and the did not dip the sandwich. Even if they had made it correctly it still would not have been good. 

If you want good Italian beef go to Lobby's in Tempe. They know how to make a real Italian beef sandwich! this may not have been the specialty of this store, but based on this experience I will never return."}
{"text":"Gyro Express is cheap and fast, definitely fills up during lunch. There is nothing special about this place, but it's good. Simply put if you're looking for a quick bite to eat and you don't have high expectations Gyro Express will do it.

The Gyro here is better than Big Fat Greek Restaurant but it's the only thing I will get when I go. If you are looking for other Greek food, wait service, a drink or going on a date then go to Big Fat...

This is one of those places I end up for lunch during the week but never get a craving for on the weekends."}
{"text":"A generous portion of meat, topped with thin sliced tomato and rough cut onion, topped with a sprinkle of parsley. I get mine with sauce on the side, which was nice and cucumber-y. Ask for well done to get it crisped up on the grill. 

FYI, fries were of the coated, frozen type and...not good. Get an extra pita for a $1.00 if you need some more starch.

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is so good. My family has been eating here for years. We love the gyros and shawirma plates. Their pita bread is so soft and yummy! Can't believe I haven't yelped this place. Glad I thought to tonight while I'm placing my take out order!!"}
{"text":"My coworker took me here once and I have been back countless times.  Everyone where I work (which is right up the street from here) loves this place and we all frequent this place.  I have only had the Gyro Salad (because I am not too experimental with food :P) and I absolutely love it!!  :) It is so delicious they give you a huge serving and it really fills you up!  I can't even finish it! The gyro salad also comes with a pita and some white sauce stuff (sorry I am not a Greek food connoisseur!!).  Although I don't consider myself an expert in this area and haven't tried anything but the Gyro Salad- but in my world of food I like this, it is a 5/5.  The people who work here are friendly and helpful and they will remember you.  The black raspberry tea is yummy.  I am so glad somebody finally dragged me to try Greek food. :D"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. The BF loves it. I think its okay.

I've had the gyro, pork souvlaki and the steak pitas here. My favorite would have to be the steak. And the steak pitas are the reason why I'm dragged here most of the time, my bf loves it. He'll come for that and I usually go for something new each time and always end up liking his steak pita more. The pork souvlaki is okay. I think if they sliced the meat thinner instead of the huge chunks, I'd enjoy it more. It was just too chewy for me. Gyros are standard, nothing remarkable. I think most places that serve gyros, use the same brand so they are all alike.

Service is friendly. Place is tidy. So it's an alright spot for the pita sandwich cravings. I haven't found one I absolutely loved but I'm working my way down the menu... and I'll let you know if I do."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the customer service is great and food is sooo good. The food is made fresh to every order, combos come with a delicious Greek salad"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is a little weird but the food is always awesome :) service is so-so, but they get the job done. The gyro plate may seem over priced, but it's really big."}
{"text":"False advertising.  Chicago dog... not warm.  Ketchup.... anyone that knows Chicago dog means no ketchup!!!!.  Fries bland.   Took a long time for hot dog.   Very disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"My Yelp search contained two words: Greek and Cheap.

I arrived at Gyro Express, the closest location to my house. Walking in, I was greeted by a nice young lady at the counter. \"I'll have the Gyro Plate,\" I exclaim with a grin. It came with hummus or fries (they were out of rice). I opted for the hummus and asked for a drink. \"It comes with a drink,\" she responded pleasantly. The total came to about $10. I frowned, thinking that perhaps Yelp had got it right with the \"Greek\" portion of my search, but not the \"cheap.\" Though, it wasn't in the $5-7 dollar range like I'd hoped, you certainly get what you pay for - a very large helping of gyro meat, hummus with a circular pita bread cut into quarters. On the side, I received a medium sized Greek salad and a drink. More than satisfied with quantity, I checked the taste. 

The meat was well seasoned and flavorful and the hummus was very good. I'm not a huge fan of the salad, though it's nice to have some greens balance out the meal. Overall, a fairly tasty Gyro meat plate that sent me home with leftovers.

Oh yeah, how did the place look? The tables and booths were well kept up and had a pristine faux wood finish. TV up on the wall, volume down so you still get the ambiance of the Mediterranean music played above. Huge painted wall of the Acropolis. Nice little place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The restaurant itself is a dive, but the food is amazing. I got the gyro plate. Tons of food. Great price. Couldn't be happier. I ordered carry out and it took them less than 5 minutes before I was out the door. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out with my coworkers and wanted just the sandwich not the meal. I get there and they put a meal for mine even though I didnt want the meal. The girl told me since the order was already put through they couldnt change it. Its just fries! how hard is it to change in their system to remove the fries from my order that ended up costing me an addition $3.00.  I had to pay for something I didnt want. Not to mention the girl behind the counter was rude about it. Food is decent but I will not go there again due to how they treat their customers. If a customer specially does not want something they shouldnt be forced to pay for it due to them not know how to change an order!! Not to mention my fries are barely warm and my gyro is mostly lettuce."}
{"text":"Mediterranean salad is one of the best  I have had. Sooo fresh and yummy.   Great for those of us who wish to eat better. It's my go to place when I come on this side of town"}
{"text":"Very good food and generous portions at a good price. Yes, it is in a mall food court so the atmosphere suffers, but it is worth the trip over to the west side."}
{"text":"It's sort of fast-food Greek here.  Pitas, \"plates\" (combos), souvlaki, Greek stuff sort of.  The food seemed reasonably fresh.  They don't have it out in 30 seconds, so I'm assuming there is some actual preparation after the item is ordered.

It was pretty good.  For the price paid I would say it was a good value.  Reasonable portions.  Gyros obviously are a staple here.  I thought they used too much tatziki, but I understand others might like it that way.  It was easy enough to scrape some off to it didn't overpower the rest of dish (the dill can be strong).

Good for a quick bite.  Very busy around lunch, apparently, but the wait time was still reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Opt for the \"greek fries\" with your combo."}
{"text":"What a charming mom and pop! I ordered the #1 Gyro Pita and my husband got the #1 Gyro Plate for dinner. His entree included a side salad, hummus, and drink. Our food came out promptly and was quite tasty! We wolfed it down before I could take a picture. 

My only complaint was that they used white onions instead of red onions. They probably ran out, and made due with what was in the kitchen. 

Definitely check this place out if you are in the Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Unfortunately they guy cooking(possibly owner) needs to work on his customer service. Heard him giving customers as well as the girls taking orders a hard time... like he was upset he was busy and it was everyone else fault."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try (because it's close to the most delectable Angel Sweet!!) despite the nyehhh review my friend gave of it and now I know, nyehhh x2.  My falafel pita was pretty sad, it almost made me cry!

The falafel was a little bland and thickly caked, a little hard to get down at times.  The lettuce had seen better days to be sure, the onion had the texture of one that'd been forgotten in the back of the fridge for a few weeks and the tomato was green - no offense against green tomatoes - when you're in Alabama and they're fried!  But the worst thing about it - no pickled cucumber?!?!?!  Huh???!!!

I noticed they were cleverly up-selling extra sauce to everyone - at .50 a pop, I fell for it but it did help me get the chunky falafel down.  Maybe falafel isn't their strong suit but even with another decent filling the veggies just wouldn't cut it for me.  Always trying to find something positive though... well...  the guy that waited on me had great hair, and the pita bread was decent I guess.  I'll drive 3x the distance to have a pita 10x as good (and cheaper!) at Haji Baba."}
{"text":"I don't know for words can express how much I love this place, but I'll try. I have been to a few other Mediterranean places over the years, and this one is still the best. The food is always delicious and consistent. They just recently updated the interior, and it looks really nice! The portions are HUGE. I usually can't finish it. Considering the portion sizes, the prices are very reasonable. For example, the combo comes with a drink, salad, main entree, pita bread, and a side (rice, fries, etc.) The service is quick when there are only a few customers, but of course slows down a little when the line is out the door. The cashiers are pretty friendly and nice! It's located next to Basha's supermarket. Anywho, if you're looking for an amazing Mediterranean place, this is it!"}
{"text":"So stoked to find such a great gyro place in Chandler. can tell the guy's from Chicago too... I haven't tried the italian beef but I will. I'm just sticking to the gyro's and plates for now.

I've now been there at least 20 times... and still loving it. 

I am sorry to see such a horrible web site.. sad. but... that's not at all what to expect with their food."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I've had! Yum!!! Definitely coming back to this place! It's somewhat of a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"i hadn't been here for about 6 months, and last friday we were starving and had a butt load of packing to do, so decided to stay nearby our old place.  Staff was polite.  Place was clean enough.  But the food has gone way downhill here.  The gyros were dripping with oil, the flavor wasn't right (probably from the oil drench), the salad (greek) was ok but we found a lettuce core in it!  This place used to be good... I guess they've just gotten lazy and forgotten how to cook?  sad... oh well, good thing I've moved out of the neighborhood... now to find a new gyro joint!"}
{"text":"Awesome Gyro's. Small so perfect for lunch or take out but the food was great. Fresh Veggies and the pitas were soft and tasty. If I had a party I'd try this for catering. Its that good :)"}
{"text":"I was craving for something different so I tried Gyro Express. I've only ate at one other Gyro Restaurant (Gyro King) and I think I'm more inlove with this one. I ordered everything To Go so with service all I can say was they were fast and accommodating. I got the Greek Salad (Yum!! Finished everything!, styro was clean haha), chicken sha-wirma and the steak one. I love the chicken sha-wirma and their serving is huge!! The steak sha-wirma was just okay. But the highlight of everything was the baklavas. AMAAAAZING!!! Ordered Baba Ghanouj too and it was flavorful. All in all very satisfied, planning to get back ASAP! :)"}
{"text":"This place has the most dank Greek food eva, and I'm not kidding bi*ches!  You will not regret eating here.  I've gotten combo plates at this place for years now.  The hummus is always legit, the salad is always fresh, the staff is always chill, and it is clean.  There is not another Greek place I'd rather eat at."}
{"text":"Well, I know I reviewed this place last year when I first started yelping so I don't know what happened to my review but I stopped in there shortly before leaving t town and just had a drink because I had already eaten but the place smelled wonderful.  I Got back to town in April of this year and stopped in here while I was in the area.  It was no disappointment.  The food was good and the service was better!  This is now on my \"things to do in Chandler\" list for future trips!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service! The food is phenomenal and the best prices I've seen. They aren't stingy with the product either. I will definitely be coming back again and again. I recommend this place to everyone who enjoys an amazing gyro."}
{"text":"update! ...been going there for years... went back recently and they still know my name, and still make the best gyro i've had in Phoenix!  They are obviously doing something right, there was a line to the door last time I went... which i had never seen there before.  I took my gyro back to work and all my co-workers were in amazement at how good it looked, how big it is, how much meat they give you, etc etc... of course i couldn't talk i was too busy enjoying every bite ;)  the less than 5 star reviewers didn't get the traditional gyro... so i suggest you order that.  It's mouth watering... and also I'll vouch for the chicago guy.. the pizza puffs there are great too! ;)"}
{"text":"Great lunch for $10 and very tasty! Would defiantly recommend if your fan of gyros. Also the tzatziki sauce was great."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place you should! One if my most favorite Gyros places in town! Gyros are great and very generous! Falafel salad is DELISH! Hummus is spot on! Alway warm, friendly and inviting! Reminds me of the Old mom and pop place we used to frequent as a kid back home in Chicago! Trust me this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"The gyros are great but I love that I can get my pizza puffs that I love so much. Only reason they didn't get 4 or 5 stars is because everytime we go there the staff isn't really that friendly. Not really a welcoming place so we call ahead now and take ours to go. Customer service ....... You guys could learn a lot from Philly's Famous"}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall gyro shop. I love their gyros, they far from skimp on the meat. And the Greek fries are AMAZING! The prices are great also and I've never had bad service."}
{"text":"The food was \"okay\".  Not very special and chicken was dried out.  They are not generous with pita bread and you have to pay a dollar for every one you want.  Lots of white onions, on everything. Their salad tasted like they just use straight white vinegar.  Might be good for a fast food style gyro, but not good to sit down and enjoy a good Greek meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a ton of times and always just get the gyro. Call me basic, I don't care.. I'm the type of guy that when I find something I like, I'll keep getting it. But nevertheless, it's good! They never skimp on the meat either. I've been catching some other Greek places doing that lately. The place is clean, staff is friendly, what else can you ask for. Cheers."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have 4 other places by work but this one is always fantastic. Their Keft plates are awesome, gyros are great. Love that everything is included, side and drink!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay, you get a decent amount of food and he was quite tasty.
We ate traditional gyros as well as salad and it was delicious.  The salad had lemon juice in it and it was great.
I was pleasantly surprised and will deff go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Generous portions, fresh ingredients, righteous pricing... Great value. Parking is easy. The people are nice. Try it!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome but I've been there twice and both times the customer service was some of the worst I ever seen. Talking about customers poorly from behind their counter, acting annoyed with questions, and overall just rude mannerisms towards customers. I'll go back for the food but knowing that service will be a shit show."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know how the food was. I started to ask the girl a question, she told me and our party of 3 to move aside so she could help the guy behind us cause he was on lunch."}
{"text":"Just okay. Not spectacular. It's not very authentic Mediterranean food unfortunately. Almost comparable to saying Taco Bell is Mexican food. I was surprised how chain-restaurant like it felt. I didn't get that feel from their website at all. We both got gyro pitas and they were just okay. Not great. I don't know what the heck they make their tzatziki sauce with, but it's definitely not authentic. Probably won't be back... would rather have the real thing."}
{"text":"Girl that took our order super friendly.  We had a gyro and Italian Beef.  It was like being back in Chicago.  We will be back for sure!  Fries were nice and hot as well - crinkle fries.  I had my beef Chicago style which means dunked in au jus.  It was just perfect."}
{"text":"This is just a good simple lamb gyro with great Tzatziki sauce. No complaints."}
{"text":"New to the area and looking for good Greek food...and I found it. I had the Greek salad. It was large and delicious. Big enough to share. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Two words. Garlic. Sauce. I like this place. I get the chicken shawarma or souvlaki plate. I've had the beef souvlaki too but prefer the chicken. They are really cool and will sub out the rice for hummus instead, and comes with a salad. Easily two meals. I always get an extra garlic sauce and pita and make sure I have all the goodies for both meals. Nice people, good service, and good value. Right by a taco shop and a subway, so there's no contest about which place to go. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable price and excellent customer service.

This is our first time eating at gyro express and we definitely will come back for more.
We had share \"supreme plate\" a combination of lamb, beef, chicken, rice and pita bread comes with greek salad, delicious!

They guy who took our order at the cashier was super nice, he has an excellent customer service.
Bravo!
Bravo!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this place and I would recommend them! The food is good and the price are fair."}
{"text":"I have only had the Gyro and Beef Souvlaki, but they were both really good.   Its a small place but does have several booths to sit at.    The meat they use is really tender and has a good flavor.   Portion size are what you would expect as well as the prices.   I am looking forward to trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"From NJ so used to East Coast gyros and gyro salads. Spot on fresh side salad, gyro meat freshly carved and seasoned, tasty on a warm soft pita. Gyro sauce creamy seemed freshly made. Prices are great, for platters you get a salad and side and drink included.  Glad we tried it, will definitely be our go to place for gyros from now on! Casual setting, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They're good, I'm a fan.  Always clean, fast, reliable service.  Good portions and ok pricing."}
{"text":"Their gyros are the best in the Phoenix area and their Pizza Puffs are Heaven on earth. Next best thing to Chicago in Arizona. Their crinkle fries are delicious too and remind me of Portillos fries only better. You can't go wrong at Gyro Express in Chandler or Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We frequently get gyros here because they are delicious and are as good as back home in Chicago.  Great Greek fries , salad too.  Casual dining area and clean."}
{"text":"10/10 BEST Gyro place. Amazing food, fast. Chef is awesome hostess/cashier is great on orders. Very busy/popular during lunch! HIGHLY recommend this place if you love gyros and anything else Greek!"}
{"text":"I go to eat at Gyro Express every week. They even know my order at the front desk and in the kitchen! The food is awesome and the service too! If you have not tried this restaurant, check it out, you will not be disappointed! It is conveniently located for lunch especially. Reasonably priced, a nice atmosphere and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a gyro and it's been here for quite a while, operated by the same folks. 

Was in a hurry last weekend and dropped in. Gyro's for the wife and I, the chicken pita (sha-wirma) for my daughter and a burger for my son (he's at THAT age). DELICIOUS. The gyros are stuffed overflowing with juicy, tender meat. Just enough tzatziki that it's not running all over (order more if you like it messy). Wrapped great to keep it warm and allow you to handle on the go.

Fries are good and again, generous amount. These are the thicker cut fries, a nice change from what I get at other fast food joints. I'm not particularly fond of the falafel from this place.

My only regret is that I forget this place serves Italian beef, Italian sausage and Chicago dogs. I'll have to try one and see how they are - after of course I ask what kind of meat, what kind of dogs (didn't see any Vienna Beef signs around).

This ain't no gourmet restaurant folks. It's good and quick food the way you'd get it in Chicagoland."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely terrible.... The only decent gyro joint in this town is Parthenon, which still isnt that great.... if youre set on ordering, order from the gyro joint attached to the pizza extreme on fish hatch"}
{"text":"First time I waked by this place with one of my coworkers, I was like it is just like any other gyro restaurant. Oh boy but once we had the meal (steak shawrma and chicken shawrma) I was like this is amazing. I am from Middle East and this is our type of food but once I tried their food it took my back home once again. The hospitality of the people is unreal and the staff is really amazing. I went back to eat there more than 8 times in one month. I recommend this place for everyone and specially for people who really want to eat an authentic Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this place and it is really good.  I got the chicken plate with hummus and side salad, big portions and excellent value, was able to save for lunch the next day.  baklava was excellent also!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this gyros restaurant! It's an awesome hole in the wall place with fresh ingredients! I'm very picky about my grilled chicken and I'm in love with there chicken souvlaki salad...yummy fire grilled!"}
{"text":"So I really enjoyed this place. The food was good. Once again I said hit me with your favorite item. DONE! The customer service was phenomenal! She was funny, nice, and very respectful. Even a pretty good portion of food. Just dont be the normal american and scarf it all down. Save some for later!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a friend and ordered the Gyro Pita with fries and a drink. Total came out to ~$8-9 which is pretty good for lunch! It was pretty busy when we went, but we were in an out within the hour. The place itself felt kind of small, but it is clean!

Overall, food was great at a good price and service was good. I honestly have nothing bad to say and would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good! Depending on the time you go it can be quite crowded and busy.  You need to save room for the baklava after your meal. It is a wonderful treat. My kids love the rice and the meat which you can order separately rather than ordering a meal.  The saffron rice is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat near the mall and decided to come here because of all the amazing reviews others had left. Maybe my expectations were just too high but I thought the food was pretty much at the level of other mall food court places. We tried the gyro over rice, a chicken dish, and the baklava. All three were pretty lackluster. It also took a little while for our food to be ready so don't come here if you're in a hurry. But, even still, the service was very friendly. I just didn't really understand all the rave about the food, though."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 4 times now.  It's not too far from my kids' school.  Great Mediterranean food for reasonable prices.  Sometimes service is iffy.  One time I placed an order to go and I had to wait on the phone for 15 minutes before the guy returned to take my call.  They must have been short handed that day.

Love their Gyro Pita sandwiches.  Falafels are good, as well as the chicken schwarma.  Kebobs are good, too.  Everything was good.  At night, the restaurant is a bit dark, though.

Will continue to come back.  We've been here for lunch and dinner.

Oh, and they have pics of all their items, which I really like."}
{"text":"I've been back here countless times and have yet to be disappointed. 
The service has always been friendly.  In fact, today I got a free baclava just because they were really busy and my order so long - the cashier said \"For being so patient\"!
I appreciate stuff like that.
But the wait is worth it to me.  Their gyro is the best I've had in Arizona and the pizza puff takes me back to my Chicago childhood.  Always delicious, too.
After over 3 years of going here, it remains a 5 star place for me.  That's saying something."}
{"text":"Small Mom 'n Pop fast food restaurant with about a dozen tables.  Typical fast food setup.

From the vast menu, we all decided to keep it simple with the Gyros sandwiches with their version of giardiniera peppers and fries.

Cashier was very friendly and pleasant.

Gyros was cooked just perfect, moist and flavorful.  The sauce was fresh & refreshing with a good consistency.  Fries were cooked just right.

Overall, happy with the service and food and prices were fair.

Will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Original Gyro has good flavor and the meat is plentiful & the sandwich was a bit small from other gyros I've gotten other places. The gyro yogurt was lacking and they didn't put enough on it so it felt like the gyro was dry. Also the girl at the cash register seem to be unhappy and lacking in CS skills."}
{"text":"Good, family owned place. Had the beef souvlaki pita and the beef schwarmam the souvlaki was well seasoned, ur overcooked; I probably should have specified medium rare, because the default is medium well. The beef schwarma was flavorful and delicious. Ask for extra garlic sauce on the side! Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing veggie pita I have ever had here! The zucchinis, peppers, onions were grilled to perfection! Throw on some feta and tzatiki and I'm in heaven! The Greek salad was wonderful too,exactly what you would expect with that wonderful tangy dressing!"}
{"text":"Stopped here a few weeks ago for lunch. Everything on the menu looked good, but I decided on a regular gyro with Greek fries. They didn't hold back on the meat or fillings for the gyro, which was very good, but the greek fries left a little to be desired. Next time I'd go with regular fries or another side dish. 

The lady who I'm guessing owns the place, was super sweet and if it were closer to home, I'd stop in more often."}
{"text":"2/2/13- prices have gone up $1.00 since 2012.  I got tzatziki on the side .50 extra. If its on the sandwich it's free, but what's the difference? I'm going to take a break from this place for awhile, which is a shame cause I really liked it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food , great price/value!  Fast food that is authentic ample and tasty.  The food actually is what got the 4th star.  The atmosphere is drawing on the place, simple fast food style.  But the food will keep me coming back.  Perfect for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! Never had a bad experience here. The cashier is always so friendly and they have some of the best pitas! Always fresh."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to try the place out after swimming, and went with the Gyro and a Sprite.  The place is okay, but it's probably not the best Gryo that I've had.  Even though the portions were large, it was short on sauce, and seemed to lack any form of excitement for my palate.

I found that the dinner plates seems awefully expensive.  Your not gonna get away without spending at least $10, more like $12 after everything for a salad, fries, drink and whatever else comes with thier combo meal.  Want an appitizer like hummus?  Tack on another $4-5 and now your talking like $15-$20 easily a person.  eeehh, not so much.  For that price, I can go somewhere else and get a better tasting Gyro/greek food.

I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here, and its that that bad, just pricey and seems to lack in some form or another.  They do have free wifi here, so thats a bonus."}
{"text":"Food was good. The young lady working counter was very friendly.Very reasonably priced with a good size portion. I had a combo meal which was a gyro, salad and a drink for under $10.....can't go wrong here if you a looking for a quick, inexpensive good meal."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in a row...food is very good no complaints there but service can certainly improve.  I wasn't too impressed with the constant stares and \"whatever\" attitude...overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I have to say after many years i have eaten at a greek place which really gave the taste i always wanted. This place is small and have decent sitting arrangement.. I went with the combo platter with chicken Sivoloki + chicken sawarma, with rice. 
The quantity is really good and it comes with salad, so make sure you bring your appetite with you when you are in this place. They give two dipping sauce and both are yummy :). It costs extra if you want another serving of sauce which was strange. 
If you are around this place surely try it you will love it. 
Place is clean and good to dine in."}
{"text":"The customer service was great here. We came in an hour before closing and, unlike most places, we were more than welcome! A sample was OFFERED to us to help us choose what we wanted to order, hot sauce and sirracha were OFFERED to be included with our to go order, substitutions were OFFERED to us when we weren't sure what some of the menu items were... seriously, it was a breath of fresh air! The food was also delicious. We ordered the #21 and appetizer sampler so we could try a little bit of everything. Our favorites: lamb gyro meat and the dolmas! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyros, and generous portions. I've been twice in three weeks even though it's 20 minutes from my home!"}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch today for a quick Gyro sandwich & fries to go. By the time I got to my office the pita bread was soaked in fat from the fatty meat, to the point that even the wrapping paper stuck to the pita bread. 
The meat looked like no Gyro meat I've ever seen & the fries were obviously from frozen. Really guys? Frozen? Don't you know fresh always taste better? Cheaper too! 
I'm giving them two stars. One for trying & the second for somehow still managing to stay in business."}
{"text":"I was hopeful but it just wasn't that good.  I had the chicken pita (which they subtitle \"shiwirma\" on the menu) and steak sandwich.  Actually I shared them both.  And an order of fries.  And a piece of baklava.  Not balaclava.  Those taste fuzzy.

So the chicken pita was ok, pretty much a three star kind of thing.  The steak sandwich was not as good.  It did not have enough meat or cheese and the bread was too heavy.  The meat was also not the best quality.

The baklava was also only two star worthy.  Poor baklava is just a disappointment.  Skip it."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and two times I have been completely satisfied. I don't give a crap about friendly service when food taste this good. Oh yea young lady at the counter was friendly lol."}
{"text":"When I come I usually let people in front of me as I'm so indecisive with what type sandwich I want along with the veggies I want to accompany my sandwich.

Gyros, shawarma , chicken, beef, or falafel just to name a few base styled meat to go with a pita. They also do veggie pitas along with everything as as a plate or salad.

I'm a fan of the gyro and shawarma pita and I like it with no onions and some lettuce. Got exactly what I wanted today in about 5mins and couldn't be happier!!!  Fountain drinks are self service so u can for those like me, you can decide at the last minute what to drink! 

Outdoor seating is available and is right next to Subway. 

Staff on hand is always in good spirits which makes a difference for people returning. See u again, next time I'm going with the shawarma!"}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking about their Greek Salad with chicken!!! Oh, and the hummus is awesome....I've been eating here on my lunch break for four years now! I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Gyros are loaded with meat and flavorful.  Not greasy at all and the tzatziki was on point. Baklava was pretty good and reasonably priced. My family will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Very friendly and fast. Might have been one dine in customer.  Q few folks walking to order every few minutes. 

As for the falafel. I'm used to red onions not white and really couldn't tell if the tahini sauce was used. Falafel appeared, just my observation to be cooked well on the outside but mushy on the inside with a look as if cornmeal or something really yellow and grainy was added to the mixture. I ask for hot sauce and that's what I got. Should have ask for saracha. It also came with no pickles. Overall farely tasty. 

I wouldn't  judge the place off my review because I'm sure most people go for the gyro and other meat dishes. When in the area check it out and share your experience. 

Peace."}
{"text":"This is a pretty run of the mill gyro shop. Not amazon but defiantly worth the money. Me and my girlfriend went here and were both pleased with the food. Service was a bit lacking"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! Great and clean atmosphere. The workers were happy and smiling,  service was great, the place was  packed and my food  was wooow delicious, and  it was out quickly and hot! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Service has changed dramatically for the better.   Good as always is excellent and hands down best gyro in Chandler"}
{"text":"This place is great. The price is right. I work across the street from Pita Heaven, which is good, but Gyro Express charges about $2.00 less for the chicken plate and a drink and salad is included. (It is not included at Pita Heaven) They give bank employees a 10% break, (So does Pita Heaven) Come in after 12:30 and the lunch crowd is a little less."}
{"text":"In my opinion Middle Eastern food that is of high quality is by far the hardest thing to find in this town.

I only came to this place because I saw another reviewer mentioned it in the same sentence as Haji Baba. To even talk about this place in the same sentence is an insult. Gyro meat was terrible and the Schwarma was totally dry.

If you want quality Middle Eastern food you have to go to Tempe or Scottsdale. Haji Baba or Byblos in Tempe or Mijana in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Gyros, yes. Express, not usually so much. Plan on a 15-20 minute wait and be pleasantly surprised if you get out of there faster.

Still, prices are reasonable and you get a freaking tremendous heap of meat for what you pay. The pitas also so delicious I don't even care whether they're made fresh or just reheated. I could (and have) eaten the pita by itself. Baklava is available in both pistachio and walnut to satisfy all your honey-soaked phyllo needs. And there's no question the dough is made with honest-to-God butter. SO. GOOD.

The tomatoes, on the other hand... I wish they splurged for better ones. A gyros sandwich doesn't have many ingredients. When one of them is terrible, like the hard, flavorless tomatoes they've been using recently, you notice. Luckily the tzatziki is good enough to almost make up for it. A well-done gyros sandwich is a thing of beauty and I hope to one day again have one here.

Service is hit-or-miss depending on who's at the counter, but the girl that's usually there is bubbly, friendly, and on her game."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here, always hot and delicious. Try the Italian beef Chicago style with extra hot peppers. It's nice to have the choice of small salad or fries. I always change it up. Gyros are great as well. I need to try more for their menu but I keep going back for these favorites."}
{"text":"The food tasted ugly. And be aware, this restaurant is not 100% halal. I saw pork on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak plate.  Steak was burned and chewy.  Taste was only char.  Rice was hard no flavour.  Salad was small and okay.  The only thing that tasted good is pita bread and tazikki sauce.  Will never eat there again.

Too much money for horrible food."}
{"text":"Woah, holy shit, another place that sells Kronos Meat Cone products and calls itself the \"best Gyros in town\"... which, if true, means every other Gyro spot is also the best in town.  As Richard Christy would say, \"It's mah faaavorite\".  Food's good, quick service despite being hella-packed, I mean, line out the door packed.  The dude at the counter might have been mentally retarded... not like, drooling and slapping his chest retarded, but functionally retarded.  

Anyway, $9 and some change gets you a huge plate of Kronos Meat Cone product, rice, salad, pita (or fries if you can get the mongoloid to understand your request), and a drink."}
{"text":"It's not a fancy place, but food is served hot and quick.  Service is friendly and helpful.  Good place for a quick and relaxed bite."}
{"text":"Tasty spot for your Gyro fix. On this visit I tried the Fire Fighter with a side salad.
Great flavors and a touch of heat from the sauteed peppers. The dressing on the salad was lively and fresh. The place is small and fills up fast at peak lunch times."}
{"text":"This is the WORST place ever. We called in an order and the girl taking our order was getting yelled at by the manager and was extremely rude to her and to us and told us we were taking too much of his time. Ummmm what happened to good customer service!!! Oh and it gets worse we go to pick up the food the manager is yelling at us from the back telling us we better not ever place a large order again. The girl working there walks out crying because the manager is yelling at her. If this is how you run your business get out of the industry. The worst service I have LITERALLY EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE. I Will NEVER EVER EVER come back here and if you're smart you'll stay away as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for something new to try at Dobson and Chandler since Chino bandido closed down! I found this across the street in the bashas parking lot next to subway and Los fav. Clean little spot with maybe ten tables booths etc. Led screen menus with at least 20 different choices. I didn't wanna be generic and get a Reg gyro so I looked at two beef choices they had one which the guy said was vinegar based and other was tangy. I ended finding a choice in bottom right corner that was a reg gyro with Italian hot peppers. Did the combo and got salad but thought I should try their Greek fries as well. Salad was fine dressing was very light but nice portion of both. Fries may have been better if I ate there but it was flavored lightly with lemon garlic.I like it when you can taste the fresh garlic and lime. I'm wondering if they just use a powder instead. I also got some baklava... It wasn't bad but dudnt taste fresh. Tl:Dr Good portion decent food and price would do it again but not best ever"}
{"text":"Ok. I don't eat Greek food so really when someone says \"let's go get Gyros\" I'm not that excited. But I went. I don't know if it was great or not. I have nothing really to compare it to. However; I can say, it was super busy. People just kept coming in. I guess that's a good sign, right? I ordered a chicken pita. And salad. All pretty normal stuff. What I got was messy and hard to eat and yes, the service is nothing special. The food at least looked and tasted fresh so that' always a plus. Cute place but gets busy and not a lot of seating."}
{"text":"This place was a joke ,we ordered food from here and when it arrived two items were missing or let me rephrase that two dinners were missing and instead of calling us and saying they were out and if we would like to order something else they just gave us a refund without us even knowing . So when we got our food two people have no dinner WOW  awesome.  Oh and they didnt even care they just kept saying you got your refund."}
{"text":"Great gyros.. overflowing with meat, and delicious. Prices are good, but there is a bit of a wait if you go during lunch time."}
{"text":"Tasty! Love the gyro and fresh Greek salad. The lemon vinaigrette is amazing. Only thing that could make this better would be fresh lettuce on the gyro. The include tzatziki, tomqtie and red onion...the meat is amazing and the wrap is soft and tasty but lettuce would lighten it up and make this a five star review!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it today on my way home to LA. Excellent Gyros both the lamb and chicken. The food quality and generous portions are well above the price. I didn't expect that tasty and that much for so cheap. 

The service was fast and friendly. The cashier came out from behind the counter every few minutes to clean tables and keep the dining room looking nice."}
{"text":"I stopped here after my yoga class and bought the chicken gyro. I thought it was delicious! Not quite sure how other yelpers gave this place a negative review, but like I said this was my first visit. The restaurant was clean, the customer service was great, and the food was perfect! Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Is very convenient to our office and they have excellent fresh Greek food. You don't skip on there to Zieke sauce when you order a gyro. And I mostly eat vegetarian and the vegetarian pizza is really good with its roasted vegi's"}
{"text":"There Gyros are huge! Super Delicious. I wish they offered a combo plate with a Greek salad, Gyro, falafel, pita bread, and hummus. Or maybe a build your own combo? Greek fries were ok. I had expected them to be better though. It looks like a typical quick grab your food and go kind of place. A few booths to sit in and a few tables. Lets just put it this way, it's not a nice sit down restaurant. Their food is bomb though so I don't care."}
