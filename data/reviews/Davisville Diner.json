{"text":"The thing about breakfast is that you don't go out unless you can't do it better and/or cheaper at home, but i do like the idea of breakfast all day long.  I was disappointed that they didn't have an a la carte/sides menu.  Sometimes the day calls for one less egg, but double the meat.   I like my breakie the way I like it, see?    I love a good Rueben, so couldn't resist.  And it was, despite the soggy bread and $9 charge, but what I really didn't like was being asked if \"fries are ok?\" only to be charged an additional THREE bucks for them.  (I would make an exception for a pile of seriously delightful frites, but these were maybe the third worst I've had)  The staff were really wonderful.  My dining companion was 2-years-old and there was no kids menu.  The proprietor brought over an enormous orange, bread, and many packets of butter which my he spent a healthy 5 minutes opening for her.    I'm afraid this place will fall into a common mistake of new restaurants by setting prices sky high from the jump, instead of luring loyalty with lower prices and then raising as business improves.   Good food, great staff, but too expensive for a diner."}
{"text":"So happy to have a new all day breakfast place nearby!   Service is fast and very friendly.  We had Eggs Benedict and Eggs Benjamin- the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was delicious. The home fries were not your typical deep fried potato cubes, but rather a beautiful concoction of potatoes and onions panfried to perfection.  The freshly squeezed orange juice was a great addition to the meal. There is lots of comfy seating and the murals, depicting various Toronto scenes, make for a great place to go for a casual meal.  Worth checking out!!!"}

{"text":"The Davisville Diner opened sometime this spring, and . . . no one noticed.    The place is completely not memorable (literally - I've been there twice and can't remember what I had either time) .  However, what is memorable is an unfortunate experience.  At brunch, my hungry friend ordered and asked if he could substitute french toast for the regular toast included with his breakfast.  The server said \"We don't do that, but I can bring you an order of French toast on the side.\"  My friend agreed, perhaps too hastily, assuming he would be charged $3-$5 for a side of French toast.  Instead, he was charge $9 (or so), meaning that his breakfast came to about $20 plus tax and tip.  I honestly thought it was a mistake and when I asked the server about it, he said that was the cost of the french toast on the menu and \"I thought you knew what I meant.\"  I explained that we obviously misunderstood, thinking the French toast would be charged the normal price of a side order.    This was an opportunity for a brand new establishment to do the right thing and remove the item from the bill, but instead we paid up and left, very unlikely to ever go back.  Also, the place seems to be run (possibly owned by) a lady who has a terribly annoying habit of hovering over her staff constantly.  It was so obvious that it made me uncomfortable."}
