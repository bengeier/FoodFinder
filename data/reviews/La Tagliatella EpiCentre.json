{"text":"Very nice waiter, lovely interior and convenient  location.  But the food just wasn't that great.  My pasta was underdone and my wife's sauce was over powered.  Our appetizer was promised to be amazing but was tolerable at best (don't order the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes)
Our experience was further dampened by the sweaty Bobcats man that was noisily shoveling noodles into his mouth and the awkward couple sobbing thru a poorly timed break up two tables away.  Seems to attract and of mixture of classy and not: the bane of anything near the epicenter"}
{"text":"4.5 stars, 2.5 price. You can't get a better deal anywhere! 

$12 for 2 glasses of wine and an enormous platter of beef carpaccio with thin sliced Parmesan reggiano?? Yep. It's true.

Or how about a $60 bottle of Stags leap for $30 on Sundays?! Enough said.

Homemade meatballs were nothing short of amazing and the olive oil is off the charts.

Homemade pasta is unbeatable and the lobster bisque is the best in Charlotte.

Don't pass this place up thinking it's too fancy or just another chain. Low key, casual dining at a 5 star quality level. Highly recommend! 

Also- Rico is the bomb.com. Ask for him- you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, it had a northern Italy vibe! I had the chicken formaggi - which was delicious. If you like the taste of three cheeses you'll love it!! Make sure to get a side of the sauce (no extra charge). My Bf had the Italian burger- home made angus beef on Cibatta bread! That was so rich - it reminded us of a meaty meatloaf burger. If that makes any sense. 

We also tired the daily special cocktail- which was called the Rudolph (vanilla vodka, coke, cherry) it reminded me of a vanilla cherry chocolate coke that had a nice spike to it! 

The mini ball roles w/ olive oil that comes with the meal was a nice touch. No starters needed - although I got a half Caesar salad. Not the traditional salad, it came with juicy sun dried tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and a light ceased dressing!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Bobby guided us through a feast of Italian specialties from thin crust pizza through meatballs and pasta to coffee and tiramisu."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  Went there tonight and had the calzone which was pretty good; however, when I asked for a side of marinara I was charged $6 for a 1/4 cup serving and not told until the bill arrived.  I spoke to the waitress as this couldn't be right and was told that corporate sets the pricing and they couldn't do anything.  I asked why I wasn't told about the astronomical cost to the sauce and she said she didn't know and agreed it was high.  Never offered to take it off or do anything about it so it ended up being my problem.  Food was just ok, service was slow for a Tuesday when it was maybe 20% full, and awful pricing.  Won't return."}
{"text":"found this place by accident at lunch today. it happened to be their \"soft\" opening. service was excellent and the drinks and food were spot on.
i cant remember the name of the drink but it is one of their specity cocktails with buffalo trace bourbon, tuaca, mint, and i believe some kind of berries in it..it was perfect.
for my entree i had the lasagna verde..seemed interesting so i gave it a shot..it was filled with spinach,cheese,pine nuts and a bunch of other great flavors..
the bread that came out before my entree was very good as well..out of the 3 types in the basket my favorite was the \"onion bread\"
for a soft opening i have to give them an A++
i will def be back there when im in clt again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The food was decent, but not great. Ordered our food and then didn't see our waitress again for another forty five minutes. The other staff was not helpful when we asked for refills or Parmesan and we eventually had to ask for the management just to get some refills. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Harrison was amazing, he gave great recommendations and really took excellent care of us. The personal care really made our anniversary dinner a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Tommy is the best bar tender and host in the epi center. Welcomes you and makes all feel like a regular. Tells the story of the place and gives the feel of Europe. The flat bread is awesome- pizza and appetizers. I visit frequently when in town. A must stop. They also have many Italian traditional dishes. Best kept secret in the Epi center!!!"}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations for this place when we first walked in because clearly a lot of money went into fancying the atmosphere here.
 We went somewhere between lunch and dinner but the hostess who sat us said \"two for dinner\" which is where my first deduction comes in. The menus were two sided 11x17, vertical, stained and seemed to cheap for the presentation of the restaurant. Typically dinner menus for pricier restaurants are put together a little nicer. I was also kind of disappointed that a specialty Italian restaurant didn't even have bruschetta :(. Well I guess my real disappointment came from the fact that the menu was mostly pizza and pasta.
 Our waitress, Jasmine, was a super highlight with her high energy and attentiveness. She was very sweet and personable and kind of actually looked like Jasmine from Aladdin haha.
 Unfortunately the food could have been better. Our bread appetizer only came with some oil. I personally prefer butter... everyone likes a little butter with their bread right? At least it was freshly baked. Also, with the potatoes being the only side offered with sandwiches, and on the same plate, the oil made our bread soggy and pretty unappetizing. The potatoes were very good on their own but my chicken breast seemed kind of bland and poorly marinated.
 We may return in the future to try other menu items since we have a gift card and hopefully everything will come together."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Our waiter, Rico, was super helpful and accommodating! 

Started off with the Focacce Liguri and Tagliatella....The focacce liguri was hard to share but very good. The Tagliatella pizza was very good-the entire table enjoyed it. 

Ordered the Goat Cheese and Caramelized Tomato salad for lunch---very good. The tomatoes were a little sour, but the rest of the salad made up for it. 

Will definitely return. Fairly priced for lunch, great servings for the price. Looking forward to having the house made pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I tried the truffle pasta and it was great. The decor is also pretty impressive and the location is unbeatable. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it's unfortunate that this place stumbles all over itself.  Food was OK at best.  Not sure who manages the place but the overall experience was horrible just because of the way it's managed.  Waited 45 minutes when there were open tables both inside and outside.  Had to ask them 3 times when we would be seated and they seemed confused.  Many of the main menu items were unavailable.  We had to make 3 selections before we found something they had.  No chicken parmesan but could make chicken marsala?  Aren't they both made with chicken?  No prosciutto.  The list goes on.  When I said something about them being out of a lot of basic items I was told they were really busy this weekend.  Hmmmm, EpiCentre was hosting Sip & Stroll and advertised well in advance.  Maybe the management team was the only people in Charlotte who didn't see the advertisements and Groupons for it.  Just crazy.  When we did get the food, it was OK, nothing great.  Had a tower of chilled egg plant, mozzarella and tomatoes that was difficult to eat and the eggplant didn't taste great.  Bruschetta that looked hastily put together on semi toasted bread that was falling apart.  Chicken marsala that didn't have much taste.  Overall, they are in a great position to do well, but don't execute well."}
{"text":"Overpriced Olive Garden - unfortunately, the quality of the food is poor and the service is sub par. Veggies are frozen, not fresh - this is a big downer on the pizzas and salads. The servers know nothing about the wine or the food for that matter. To give them a break, the place is brand new. I do not recommend this restaurant and predict it will close within 6 months."}
{"text":"La Tagliatella just opened up in the Epicentre and we got an invite to attend the special media night. Being the type of foodies to never pass up an invitation for FREE food we made our reservations and off to La Tagliatela we went.

When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess, given name tags, a media packet, and seated quickly. The night started with a little bowl of olives and a delicious trio of focaccia including tomato, green olive, and onion. The appetizer courses included a caesar salad and a duet of focaccia flat breads. The first with goat cheese, honey, bresaola, balsamic reduction glaze, and finished with crushed pistachios. The second with provoletta cheese, duck ham, arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano.

That was quickly followed by the thin crust Tagliatella pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, fried eggplant, parmigiano reggiano, drizzled with honey and aceto balsamico. The two home made pastas that followed were a pappardelle with black truffle, parmigiano reggiano, a fried egg and black caviar, followed by a tortellone stuffed with mozzarella tomato and basil and topped with a sauce of sole di puglia tomatoes, balsamic onions, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, basil and grana padano. They saved the best for last and brought out two desserts. Bocconcino, a fresh cheesecake and carmel custard, and Torta Rocher, a chocolate and hazelnut mousse cake.

Everything about our dinner and experience at La Tagliatella was fantastic. The food was all fresh, hand made and delicious. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the dining room was gorgeous and we had a blast."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian. Great service and the food was wonderful. Has a old saloon feel. High range of pasta choices and the server was great in suggesting what to select with your pasta. Definitely a repeat location when in downtown charlotte."}
{"text":"I have given this place 2 tries and both times I wish I could have gone to Olive Garden rather than this place. At least there you get a consistently average meal, where here it has been below average both times. To start off with, if you're going to have alcoholic specials in North Carolina, you must do them all day. You can't have them for specific hours of the day. Both times there have been issues when asking the staff about specials. 

First time I came to this restaurant, I ordered the pizza. Absolutely nothing special about their pizza. Have had way better tasting ones from Brixx down the street. Second visit I ordered the soup and salad. I know, how can you mess that up?! But when you offer lobster bisque and there is no lobster in it, I would say that is a fail. Also, the croutons on top were very soggy. Salad was not that good either. Dressing tasted nasty to me. 

Two tries and no better the 2nd time versus the 1st = I will not be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the $5 pizzas at Happy Hour.  You can't beat the value for a pretty good crispy crust pizza with interesting topping choices.  I got the Bismarck which has ham and a fresh egg, and it was quite good with a side of the chili oil to dip into.  Crust is wafer thin and cracker crispy, toppings are light and not a lot of cheese, so not greasy at all, actually tasted kinda healthy which I liked.  It was a slow night, so service was efficient at the bar. No drink specials during happy hour, but a draft is only $4 for a craft brew.. not too bad.  Definitely a good stop before heading into a Checkers game or other event across at the arena."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing (we made our own pastas) and yet the service stole the show! Terrell took amazing care of us! Him and management asked to refresh our martinis and had great suggestions from beginning to end. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I work Uptown and we stopped in for the $5 lunch special. Special it was NOT. First, our waiter took ten minutes to greet us. Then we waited another ten minutes for our drinks (water!). Finally, the host came to the table with our bread, which was exactly thirty seconds before the food came out. I timed our wait, 20 minutes for a salad. There was hardly anyone else in the restaurant and I noticed our waiter was more interested in checking his phone in front of patrons. 

Second, the food was par at best and not worth more than the $5 we were charged. My husband ordered the Tagliatella salad and it looked cheap, cold ham on top, half an egg, one tomato if he was lucky some corn on the bottom. It was mostly lettuce. I believe he had 3 pieces of shrimp on top. I ordered the Mezza Luna and it was disgusting. I've had Mezza Luna at other fine dining establishments and this was by far the worst. Mezza Luna pasta is filled with goat cheese and bacon. The pasta I was served was stuffed with ham. I did not taste (or see) goat cheese. A good Mezza Luna would have soft white goat cheese in the middle, not a red filling that is the consistency of boiled ham. The sauce was salty and gross. I am pregnant and was so hungry that I ate most of the plate even though the after-taste made me nauseas. My husband tried a bite and he said the same thing, the after-taste was gross.

Overall, it was a nice try for $5 but we will not be returning for the regular priced menu. Olive Garden is honestly better, and we rarely eat at chain restaurants. If La Tagliatella wants to compete Uptown they need someone to make their food worth it."}
{"text":"I'm torn on whether this is a 2 or 3 star place / experience. Lunch was dead. There were a max of 3 tables the entire time I was there (12:30-2). The waiter was very pleasant when he was around, but unfortunately I think he might've been the only waiter for the entire place. It's a large restaurant, so maybe it takes him five minutes to walk to the kitchen and back.  

Two service complaints: 
(1) the food came out soooooo slowly for lunch (90 mins is not acceptable) and there was a huge wait between each course (bread, soup, entree). Not only was it slow, but at one point while he was refilling our glasses, the waiter mentioned that he saw the food in the kitchen window so it was ready. If it's ready, bring it to our table. Don't make me think it's been sitting out there getting cold for a while.
(2) after we were finished eating, we sat for at least 15 minutes waiting for him to come back around so we could ask for the check. The food delay I can blame on the kitchen. But forgetting about your table after you've served them their main course, that's the waiter's responsibility and not cool. Especially when it's a lunch crowd who might potentially be late for work meetings as a result of this delay. 

As for the food, I found it to all be average. It's nice to get bread at the start of an Italian meal, however this bread is small, somewhat hard, little roll nuggets. The bread did not add anything to my experience. 

MINESTRONE SOUP was very (temperature) hot, which is a good start, and there were lots of veggies. Not bad at all, and if I happened come back, I might try it again. The LOBSTER BISQUE was bland, with minimal flavor and so thick it was almost like eating flavored sour cream. 

The GOAT CHEESE AND CARAMELIZED TOMATO SALAD was interesting. And by that, I mean strange. The \"roasted corn\" was clearly canned, with an unacceptable chewiness. I'm not a fan of sweets in salads, so take this critique for what it's worth, but the caramelized tomatoes were awful. The caramelization was a thick hard cold candy coating on the outside of the tomato. It was like eating a candy apple but finding a tomato in the middle. The pistachios were not crunchy, as if they'd been exposed to moisture for a while. I've had this salad twice, because I liked the goat cheese both times, but I won't be fooled into a third tasting. 

The GARDA PIZZA looked ok, other than that the cheese had solidified into a cold layer on top. This pizza comes with large thin slices of ham and mushrooms, which possibly were canned. The thin crispy crust was light and very nice. It had potential, if it had been served hot.

The restaurant is very large and highly decorated, with a nice ambience. Unfortunately I can't waste an hour and a half for lunch on a workday. I might be tempted to occasionally risk it if the food were great, but it's not."}
{"text":"We are very happy we went here for a early dinner. Service (Carley our server) was outstanding. We shared a happy hour pizza as an appetizer. Delicious. My husband had the round ravioli with cheese and a red sauce. He loved it. I had the pasta stuffed with goat cheese and bacon with a light cream sauce. Very good!! Quality Italian food, expect an upscale dining experience."}
{"text":"Okay I didn't expect much from this place. I just liked that it was well - lit and as a business traveler I had some work to do. The food was decent not special but the service floored me. It was like a 5 star hotel:  very accommodating and helpful without being overly familiar and chatty. I sent my beer back because it was warm. They were very gracious about that, brought me samples of the other drafts. This great service started with the host reading my body language when he sensed I wanted a bigger table even though I was a party of one.  I'll go back to this place for sure and recommend it."}
{"text":"My 8 oz filet was cooked perfectly. It would melt in your mouth. The decor is classic. Bobby, our server, did a nice job of keeping the beverages flowing on New Year's Eve. We will be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here before seeing a movie, so we only had about 45 minutes. The menu selection was great, and the service was fast and friendly. Weirdly empty for a friday night, although we did come in around 7:30."}
{"text":"Started with a Mulo Siciliano and Provoletta. We had barely started our appetizer when our pasta entrees came out (super fast = very suspicious). I had the Mezzaluna in the Carbonara sauce. It was flavorful and smoky, but very salty. 

Overall, the food and drink were mediocre. I'd come back if I needed a fast Italian meal, but for real good eats, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Back to the drawing board...We ordered the quatro formaggio and this sauce reminded me of the kind sauce that comes in a box. Hardly any flavor and powdery.  The other tasted better but I was looking forward to chewing the pine nuts and tomatoes not have everything liquified and poured over the pasta.  The lunch dishes we ordered were not a good value. When you are out pricing the competition, at the very least, serve bread with your pasta.  There is a place a block over that is doing this wayyy better. They're caled Vapianos....Good Luck.

FYI...the stars are for the service."}
{"text":"I know they just opened. However, the menu was very hard to understand it needs to be more Americanized. Also, the food was that great. I've had better they could do a lot better for the pricing. But I love the atmosphere so relaxing. Doesn't feel like I'm in Italy but it feels like I'm in a 4 star Italian restaurant in NYC."}
{"text":"Went here for Dinner last night. I'd say it was a 4.5 star meal! Really, really excellent. First off, they make their pastas in house daily. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Started off with delicious Italian bread balls with a pungent olive oil and sweet balsamic dip. 

This place has REAL Caesar salad folks. If you don't know that means ANCHOVIES. Not to my taste they did ask if you want them I said no. The salad itself was delicious, with very fresh cherry tomatoes and a tasty dressing....not too heavy. Just right.

The star of the meal easily was the fresh pasta dish. It was a Parmigiana and Black Truffle cream with chicken over fresh Tagliatelle pasta. Just a delicious flavor! Oh truffle where art thou......I mean how does one not love truffle over fresh pasta. Clearly one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Almost as good as Passion8 Bistros mafe by Italian Chef Luca.

Decent wine selection, reasonable prices, and a nicely decorated interior makes this place a great date night option.

Highly recommended! For those of ypu who panned it after they first opened, you should come back and give them a second chance. My palate says they clealy got their act in order!"}
{"text":"My group and I swung by here on a whim right before an evening concert across the street at the TWC. We were seated immediately upon arrival which was a pleasant surprise considering it was already during the dinner rush. Our server was friendly and very knowledgable of all the items on the menu and highly recommended we go with their in-house made pasta dishes. We took her suggestions and all were exceptional. We started with their mussels appetizers. A little on the pricey side for the amount you get but you can definitely taste bold and flavor of the white wine which we enjoyed. Anything you get here is rich in flavor and texture and very filling. Take home boxes for everyone. Yummy leftovers."}
{"text":"It was a quiet Tuesday night when I came in so that may skew our dining experience a bit, but overall we were very well taken care of and happy. The restaurant interior feels like a Disney experience. Very high ceilings with lots of warm wood and Italian written everywhere.  Our waiter was very sweet and made a fee recommendations, but we just weren't that hungry. We got a couple peices of tomato and Carmelized onion bruschetta. That was so good. The chicken marsarsala, also very good,  and olio with lemon slices. The last thing was so nice, because what I didn't know was it was off menu and the chef never made it before.  He Googled and made it special for me. That was so sweet. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out before a concert at the arena one night.  We arrived at 5:30pm, there were only a few other tables in the whole place at first.  The service was extremely sloooow.  It took about 15 minutes for us to even get a drink.  More and more people were coming into eat and you could tell they were not prepared at all.  It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me - if you are a restaurant at EpiCenter wouldn't you look at the arena schedule of events and plan accordingly knowing that people would be looking for some food and drinks before a big event?

The food was just okay.  They brought rolls, but there was no butter or oil or anything to go with them.  We tried to order a few things off the menu and kept being told \"oh, this is a new menu and we don't have that yet\".  What really got me is when I received my \"Goat Cheese and Caramelized Tomato Salad\" and there were no tomatoes on there.  Hmmm.  I asked the food runner and was told that they had run out of caramelized tomatoes, but could bring me some other tomatoes.  Now, why wasn't I told this or offered other tomatoes to begin with?  I wouldn't have even ordered that salad.  

The server knew we were headed to a concert, but never sensed our urgency.  We had to track him down by walking over to him to get our checks.

There are plenty of good restaurants in EpiCenter.  I wouldn't pick this one again."}
{"text":"Not your traditional Italian place, however the good was great. We had a small pizza as an appetizer and a red sauce main entree that I do not recall the name of. Great service by Carlie! Would be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The server was very nice but he was also the bartender and couldn't be attentive to our table as needed. Plus he got sat a table of 12. Unsure if they were under staffed but the food wasn't that great to possibly return again. I wouldn't mind returning to give the service another go."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences! While out waiter was very friendly, the service he provided was less than stellar and his menu knowledge even less. We ordered a martini special that wasn't even actually a martini (served in a rocks glass with ice) which ended up NOT being on special when the bill came. A few of our entrees came out cold ( my risotto was warm but had the consistency of paste). To top it all of 2 of the people at our table were over charged on their bills from what the menu price was. AND even after all that, we never saw a manager, no apology....nothing! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Jalil and Tiffany were great servers....the food was fantastic.   It was my first time here and I rate this a 5 definitely.   Thank u for everything!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight to have dinner at the bar.  Ordered a glass of wine and carpaccio to start.  First piece of beef that I picked up and put in my mouth was frozen, along with others around it.  Manager apologized and I walked out.

Had an OK meal here the week before with service mishaps that could be blamed on the crowd there before the Pearl Jam concert, but tonight was a slow night, so two strikes and you're out in my book."}
{"text":"The food is really good here, all made fresh in-house with authentic, imported ingredients, but the real star is the service. Tagliatella does not play when it comes to making you happy. I've been by several times and each one walked away impressed by the hostess, waitstaff, bartenders, etc. They've hit on the perfect formula of warmth and friendliness--you really walk away feeling like you know them!--without being overbearing. Love this place."}
{"text":"I had the Best Time here last night!!!!!!! The food was AMAZING!!! Our waiter was the freaking best! Shout out to Kyle for giving exceptional customer service! His recommendation was GREAT! Let's not forget about the $3 Bellini special (Saturday & Sundays) I look forward to eating here again very soon. Thanks again to Kyle *Muah*"}
{"text":"Solid food but the service is lacking.

We were sat quickly and our server greeted us in a timely manner. She was very nice, but not efficient at her job. It was far too long between visits from her and she had to make far too many trips to the table to get anything done.

The bread they bring out before the meals is tasty and hot. It has good flavor on its own, but is even better with a little olive oil and vinegar. For my meal I ordered the Penne with Four Cheese Sauce and Meatballs. The sauce had very good flavor as did the meatballs. The pasta was a little over cooked, but not too bad.

If they can figure out the service aspect this is an ok place to eat. It took us far too long to eat with a normal size group and basic orders. The food is priced inline with what you would expect from similar joints."}
{"text":"For being open only three days, they have definitely exceeded my expectations.  I hope they can keep it up!

Everyone we met including, Lauren, Katie & Daniel were truly welcoming & so helpful!  The suggestions they made were really good ones.  They explained that it's Italian with a Spanish influence...  That definitely made sense with the decor, which is slightly overdone, but still pleasing.  If a Spanish influence with the food means it's a bit more hearty, than 2 thumbs up to that, too!

I had the Napoletano Brochette which is skewered (& dangling) pork tenderloin, solé di Puglia tomatoes, balsamic onions layered with fresh whole leaf basil and served with a special Tagliatella sauce and fried gnocchi.  I changed the sauce up to the Casalinga Sauce  (Italian sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pine nuts and Mascarpone) which was an upcharge, but well worth it.  The pork was cooked absolutely perfectly & each bite was a true taste & texture pleasure to eat.  I would definitely get this again!!!!  The fried gnocchi was good, not oily or overdone.  It actually tasted more like it was baked - which is ok, too.  I think I'd like a different side with this the next time though, probably a vegetable.

My sweetie got the Tagliatelle Pasta with Pesto Sauce & Chicken.  It was good, but not as good as mine!!!

We got the Piquitos Valentino Sparkling Moscato & it was delicious!  It was not super sweet or syrupy like a lot of moscatos.  It was more like a fruity, sparkling crisp reisling.  I'll definitely be looking for this to buy!

I had to try the Tiramisu... while the flavor was there... I just didn't get enough of the espresso-soaked, cakey, ladyfinger texture.  Only a little spoonful of it in the very bottom of the dish.  Also the cream part was really a mousse, again, not a true Tiramisu... it was a Tiramousse-u.  

Overall, though - Yes!  I would eat here again and enjoy it, especially if the staff stays friendly & helpful & the food continues to be of the quality we enjoyed this night."}
{"text":"It was a Tuesday night so the restaurant was almost empty, which was good as I was there for a business dinner.  The food was good, not great - and the service pretty much matched that.  Nothing I would complain about, but nothing that would entice me to come back again either."}
{"text":"I think three stars is the sweet spot for this place after having given it four stars and two stars prior.  Came here with a couple of buddies for lunch, and it was... pleasant. 

First off, service was good.  Hostess was average but server held it down for LT.  Place was near empty for an early 11:30AM lunch so that might have influenced service level.  Not trying to knock the dude, just letting others know.  Anyways, he was good with timing, which comes with experience.  Lunch order taken timely, drinks refilled timely, and bill came out timely. Not too early and not so late that life becomes miserable. 

Meatball Ciabatta was aiite.  The real reason for ordering it was curiosity as to how they could use ciabatta for a meatball!  Bleh, they just cut it in half.  I think it is made in-house. 

Mmm, it's okay and I'll go if someone wants to go there but I won't go outta my way to hit up LT. 


Dmo out."}
{"text":"I completely take back my comments.  They are so slow that they hardly care and staff is uninterested and complacent.  Maybe lunch is busy but dinner is a ghost town. Ended up walking out after waiting 10 minutes to grab a beer before the hornets game."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! a little over priced but very good. the host was going to seat us somewhere very crowded so I asked to sit somewhere else. no problem. my server was very unprofessional and he was training someone..she was much more professional..a large party was being seated near us the same host made a unnecessary comment about it (bc I asked to be seated elsewhere earlier) and my fiancé didn't receive his sides with his meal. told the manager and he handled it very nicely and professionally. that is the only reason I would go back."}
{"text":"We arrived a little before 12:00 pm & there was only 1 person at the bar and one other table with three guests. We were seated and approached by our waitress for our drink order. She asked if we had been before, which we said no. She explained the lunch menu as well as the entree menu, b/c they offer that as well. We asked for a few minutes and she returned literally in 30 seconds. Although we felt rushed, we ordered the Parma Pizza, ham and mushrooms(although substituted chicken for the ham) & the Chicken Piccata entree. While we waited we were served rolls and EVOO, which we fresh and delicious. The food arrived and the pizza was great, crisp, fresh, and a light pizza for lunch. The chicken was good, however, unlike other piccata dishes the chicken was very thick & bland, missing a little lemon/caper flavor. The sides, green beans & potatoes, were good. Although the food was decent, the service was a little disappointing, especially with the amount of people there, and the fact we sat with empty drinks, at which she filled them when she brought the bill. Overall, I enjoyed the ambience and pizza, but wasn't overwhelmed. I would love to go back and try some pasta."}
{"text":"Terrible! Multiple groups were waiting near the hostess stand and no employee noticed until someone went and found one. Not a busy night - multiple open tables. Finally was sat and waited yet another 20+ minutes to get drink orders. Supposed \"computer issue\" (I understand these things do happen occasionally) but groups before and after us received their entrees, paid, and left before we received our appetizer. Entrees finally arrived and were cold and lacking flavor. Should/would have gone somewhere else if others weren't busy. It should have told us something when they were the only restaurant with available tables at the epicenter. Off night?"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have thought that La Tagliatella had more than one location. It didn't give me the chain vibe when I first passed this place while visiting the Epicenter. Thinking of NYE plans, I picked this place to kick off our night. With mixed reviews, I thought this place was pretty good. The service was prompt and friendly- they recommended dishes and explained the portion sizes- more family style and shareable. 
We all split large salad with fried goat cheese to start with a carbonara pasta. The pasta sauce wasn't too heavy. We also ordered the eggplant pizza. A little too cheesy for my liking. I felt like the cheese to sauce ratio was off. The pizza crust was super thin. 

Overall, this was a good meal and priced well."}
{"text":"What makes this place so special? It's a NORTHERN Italian Restaurant, which means it's DIFFERENT from the heavy-Southern Italian food we Americans are more used to.  Seeing the reviews on here, I'm guessing that a lot of folks were not expecting the difference?

  What we learned (as visitors on a Food Tour), is that Northern Italian cuisine is lighter.  Smaller.  Which is interesting, because it was the heaviest food we were treated to on our food tour.  We enjoyed a nice wine, marvelous focaccia (olive, tomato and onion varieties were all great), and my FAVE which was a marvelous scrumptious very thin and oh-so tasty pizza:

 Tagliatella 15 Tomato, mozzarella, fried eggplant, Parmigiano-Reggiano drizzled with honey and balsamico glaze.  Oh MY, this was so delicious, I actually asked for a doggie bag when our group didn't finish it.  My Italian Grandma was on my shoulder saying \"honey don't waste it\", which I was in full agreement with anyway.

 The secret to enjoying this awesome restaurant is to expect the unexpected.  I can't wait to go back and try more things!"}
