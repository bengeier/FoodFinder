{"text":"Cabane à sucre Hallal ?
     La famille Constantin de St-Eustache change nos recettes traditionnelles pour accommoder une minorité religieuse.
     Si je vais manger chez Basha ou un autre endroit spécialisé dans une cuisine traditionnelle Arabe je ne m'attend pas à ce qu'ils modifient leurs recettes pour m'accommoder et je respecte ça.
    Pourquoi alors a t'on enlever le porc de la soupe au pois et des fêves ? Je ne connais AUCUNES recettes traditionnelles de ces deux mets qui ne contiennes pas de porc.
    Cette cabane à sucre existe apparemment depuis 75 ans, pourquoi alors abandonner nos traditions après tant d'années ? La piastre, voila pourquoi. Ce manque de respect pour nos traditions m'attriste et me fait peur."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed this sugar shack! I wish they were opened all year long. The food was good, and they did not bring too much food. Great way to avoid waste. What I wanted was the donuts, but sadly they did not have any. However I this is my favorite cabane a sucre so far.

We did not get to try to Tire sur la neige. We went mid April , and it was  very warm outside. 

They have many different sweet maple products to buy!  

Tip are not included!"}
{"text":"Cabane à sucre parfaite...le temps d'attente n'est pas si long. Le service et la nourriture est excellente. Il y a une petite ferme \"exotique\" et d'autres activités pour les enfants. Super endroit pour y aller en famille ou en amis!"}
{"text":"I think that it's really vital to have the real, expérience d'antan, olde-timey rolicking fun of a cabane à sucre if you live in Québec and especially if you are not from around here. Now, there's the classic, middle-of-the-woods, magical winter wonderland book-it-half-a-year-in-advance kind, and then there's the roadside dive, which has all the traditional food, but is somewhat lacking in atmosphere. This is the latter variety, but I still think it's a great way to get acquainted with the quintessentially québécois pastime.

The food was fine. (I mean, smother anything in real maple syrup and you have a delicious meal.) You buy a meal ticket and then eat whatever the plat du jour is, family style. We ate a gigantic omelette with sausages and ham with boiled potatoes, coleslaw, beans, and many pickled things for accent. I have to say, the service was great. Everyone was really friendly and attentive.

So you can also go on a short horse carriage ride through the woods, which we had to do because it started snowing big puffy flakes right when we finished our meal. And there's also the tire d'érable (maple taffy made in the snow). There also seem to be a lot of other activities for kids, but, not having a kid, we didn't make it to any of those. This place is on the site of an old (currently working?) farm, so there seemed to be a lot of \"d'antan\" type fun."}
{"text":"The good aspect of Canadian waiting is that everyone seems to be happy and not stressed out. There's no reservations and you will have to wait in line for about 45 minutes.  A very important advise about seating. **right after seating make sure you make space comfortable enough for you to seat**  Otherwise you will be cramped.. I got cramped and I saw a few other cramped and uncomfortable.  Food is good and the service is so polite and friendly and they deserved a nice tip. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I'm not a local, and I am reviewing this \"cabane a sucre\" (sugar shack) from an American's point of view.  My family really wanted to see a sugar shack while vacationing in Montreal in March.  I looked at lots of sugar shacks online, but it was the guy who rented us his VRBO apartment who suggested Constantin's.

We were VERY happy with our experience here!  The horse drawn carriage ride was simple, but it was really cool being able to see the trees tapped, drawing out the maple sap.  The little petting zoo was probably one of the best we've ever been to, with lots of well-taken-care-of animals in a small, but clean and bright indoor area.  The dinner was a traditional \"cabane a sucre\" one, served family style, with unlimited refills.  There was bread, pate and several jars of pickled vegetables on the table when we were seated.  Then came bean soup, followed by cole slaw, a fluffy omelet with sliced ham and delicious pork rinds on top, boiled potatoes, small sausages, and beans (\"pork and beans\" style).  Dessert was a choice of sugar pie with ice cream (yummy!) or some other cake (which we did not try).  Of course, there was a large carafe of maple syrup on the table, which was much tastier and less sweet than the cheapie American kind.  This may sound like a strange menu to outsiders, but it is the traditional meal served at sugar shacks - just go with it, it was actually quite good.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, and the locals sitting next to us were quite friendly as well.

After dinner, even though you are stuffed, you can go to the ice house to sample as much frozen maple toffee on a stick as you want.  The ice tender pours fresh syrup on the ice, you wait 15 seconds to let it get cold, then use a popsicle stick to wind it up into a small lollipop.  The toffee is very sweet with a mild maple flavor, not like the strong (and probably artificial) maple taste Americans are used to.  You can then wander outside and huddle around the festive outdoor fire, enjoying the cold air.

There were other activities that we did not participate in, like a puppet show (held throughout tha day, ending around 4:30pm, I think) and a disco on Friday and Saturday nights, which are probably very nice as well.  All in all, we had a great, festive time, and I would certainly recommend Constantin's to anyone looking to experience a fun piece of Canada's heritage."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sugar shack - I've been coming here for the past 2 years and really enjoy the food, the menu is different than other places I've been to, with a better selection of desserts which seals the deal for me.

Most sugar shacks are similar in that you can eat as much ham, beans, omelette and sausages as you want, but Constantin offers soft serve ice cream and fluffy pancakes that make all the difference! You can still opt for classic sugar pie and poudding chomeur too.

You can buy premade meals to go, tons of maple products, visit a little petting zoo, go on a tractor ride, and book this shack for your own events - They do weddings and receptions.

The place is always packed and booming with large groups, bus tours, senior citizens and students on an outting - Come on a weekday, as it's 4$ cheaper than the weekend.

The few drawbacks are the long communal tables, you can be seated elbow to elbow next to strangers, the dining room is extremely noisy and I wish they offered breakfast style roasted potatoes rather than their plain boiled potatoes.
If you can suck it up for a not so comfortable experience, you will be rewarded with delicious food."}
