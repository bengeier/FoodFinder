{"text":"I tried the Beef Ribs the other day. It was difficult to know what a 1/2 rack was but I received 2 HUGE ribs! The ribs were tender. I ordered with sauce on the side, but I think it will taste better sauced. Same goes for the rib tips."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Madison hands down...by far. Indeed,  it looks sketchy because you are in fact ordering cooked meat out of a trailer at a gas station. You might even start doubting yourself. Believe you me though, it is worth it. Matter of time before the secret gets out on this place. I get the chopped pork sandwich and potato salad every time. The \"bark\" on the pork is so delicious. You can taste the wood and the sauce is spicy right. If the devil cooked BBQ, I believe it would taste something like this."}
{"text":"The brisket is the best I have ever had! Perfect smoke flavor and barbecue sauce is delicious. The guys working there are super freindy. I will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Finally, awesome southern style bbq in Madison! I stopped by today after smelling the delicious hardwood as I drove past the Shell station on Broadway. It's all about the food here - big smoker out front, a pick up bed full of hard wood to fuel it, and a food cart to serve it up. I got a half rack of ribs and an order of rib tips, both of which came with two sides. The ribs came straight off the smoker, modestly sauced and packed up to go.
The cook on the ribs was prefect - beautiful bark on the outside, almost fall off the bone inside. The deliciously heavy smell of smoke permeates every bite and the sauce is a balanced, peppery flavor, just sweet enough to balanced a little tang in it. I'll be ordering an extra side of sauce next time. I wanted to savor the ribs, but I couldn't help inhaling them instead.
The baked beans were tasty, but the potato salad was a little mustardy for me. I was too full to try the coleslaw, but it looks homemade. They had homemade banana pudding today and I couldn't pass that up. I'm not one for desserts, but I love bananas. It was everything I was hoping for - rich, creamy, cakey (that's a word, right?), delicious. Papa's BBQ is going to see a lot of me in the future."}
{"text":"Me and a coworker split a whole chicken, 2 sides. The bones easily separated from each other. The bbq sauce was just spicy enough. Great smoke flavor. Beans were excellent. Slaw tasted like home. The wait is long around lunch, but well worth it. I try to go every week, at least once."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd get a tip n' link combo north of the Chicago border that rivals, if not stands head to head , with all the Chicago BBQ greats. That is, until I finally hit up Pa'Pa's BBQ. This place is beyond legitimate Barbecue, from the incredibly flavorful bark on their ribs to the cool little shack they serve it out of--this is the real deal.

The rib tips I got were insanely meaty. The rub created a pungent, complex flavor profile, but was not over the top. The hot links were incredible; lean and smokey with a nice spicey flavor. The sauce was complimentary of the meats. To top it off, all of the sides were equally delicious and the service was friendly. 

SO great to have found this true gem."}
{"text":"OMG, I have finally found real brisket in Madison! Absolutely fantastic. It wasn't quite as tender as I've had but the flavor was as good as any I've had anywhere. Can't wait to come back to try the pork and the ribs. Had a great chat with the owner and great to see the pride he has in his work.

Edit: They are open again for 2017 and just as good as ever if not even better!"}
{"text":"If you like hidden gems this place is for you. I had driven past at least a dozen times and always wondered about this place. It was the amazing smells that finally made me pull over. I had brisket and it was excellent. I only wish they were open longer hours."}
{"text":"Oh my. If you want the best BBQ north of anywhere -  then check this place out. Don't keep it to yourself. Share the love. Just moved here from Tennessee and it's the best BBQ I've had in more years than I can remember. My wife and I planned to get a snack at the next door gas station and the smell pulled us over. We ended up going nearly comatose from what we thought would be a mere light afternoon treat. We were wrong. Oh were we wrong. We decided on the rib tips with fries and potato salad. Turns out under the massive mountain of meat there was Texas toast. For $10.99 (we only ordered one dish) we ate like kings. I'd recommend that they provide wet naps. Not for the mess, but possibly to MacGyver some flotation devices for swimming out of the delectable moat of sweet and tangy sauce."}
{"text":"Great food! Great value for the money. Owner puts a lot of pride into his work. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"The brisket is a solid option. You get a large portion for cheap money. The brisket is tender and has the right amount of chew to it. You can taste the smoke but it doesn't over power the meat. The option I order came with 2 sides for under $14. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've driven past this grill so many times wondering what it was..  YOU should stop!! It's the best BBQ in Madison. Absolutely amazing. The brisket is amazing, I love the sauce!! Also, I'm really picky with coleslaw but loved this!!! Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The smoked chicken, is the most juicy chicken I have ever had, my husband loves the double hamburger, but fish fry day and those hushpuppie,  catfish and slaw, I will go no where else ever!!!!! I don't know what they do to the fried chicken wings, I don't fry chicken any more."}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best BBQ to move past my lips. Epic portions wonderful smells. The hush puppies and coleslaw were just as awesome as the rib tips. Next time I'm trying the catfish I almost was going to sit there till it was time for dinner"}
{"text":"Freakin  fabulousness . Seriously the best BBQ brisket  I have ever eaten. This food truck should be on that TV show on the Food Network. I would drive across town to go to this food truck. If it was near where I worked I would eat there for every single lunch. The portion was huge and the price was low. The meat was seriously pure glorious craftsmanship. Barbecue at its very best by people who know what they are doing. It was delectable. I'm totally serious I was at a blues Festival and they were there. All of the people sitting around me we're just going on and on about how amazing and and just mind-bogglingly good the barbecue was. Don't often post critiques of businesses. But these guys were so good I felt compelled to write a review."}
{"text":"True, hardwood, smoked BBQ right off an inconspicuous Broadway gas station is where you will find the best brisket in the area. The meal included a sweet/vinegar sauce that perfectly complemented the slow-cooked, smoke-infused offerings. Seriously - this stuff is the real deal. You just can't get this anywhere! For the sides I would recommend getting the coleslaw and the baked beans which have a unique peppery finish. 

You may have to plan your visit here as the are only open Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday around lunchtime...and this by no means is a strict schedule. If you see the smoke billowing - you should be stopping to place an order."}
{"text":"Oh man, what a welcome and unexpected surprise on our way just passing past Madison. What a frickin GEM. My friend asked, \"What's on the brisket sandwich?\" The reply: \"Brisket, why, you need something else?\" No, good sir, we needed not one thing else. The meat was smoked well, not overpowering, but flavorful. The sauce was so dang good. I love it with a little tang, and this was perfect. Portions of the brisket were a little tough -- not being a BBQ pro, not sure if that's regular, but that's the reason I didn't give this place a fifth star.

And he let me try the banana pudding on the sly. Never had it before, may never have it again, but as far as appetizers go, I nearly ruined my appetite on the stuff. So good.

This food truck, upon the grass at the edge of a gas station, is fine eating with good company. Thanks for making one of the fondest memories of our little road trip."}
{"text":"Man nothing is more exciting like discovering something amazing like this. PaPa posts up in a assuming spot next to a gas station.. Smokes his meats on site.. And then opens for business out of the side of a food truck. I arrived at 6pm and they were already almost sold out!! I scooped up the last of the brisket along with some potato salad and fried. Everything was spot on and makes chains BBQ like Famous Daves taste like fast food. Get while it's hot people!!!!"}
