{"text":"Great place for a group of friends celebrating a birthday!    We started out with some appetizers which were great for sharing such as calamari, chicken meatballs, spicy edamame, and some crunchy spiced pork pieces.   All were delicious.   The area we sat at consisted of 2 flat grills 2 cooks and so our table was divided in half.  Sam really added to the experience as he was very engaging with everyone with his great humor.    Dinner included a salad with some ginger dressing, onion soup, and for the main course I had their NY steak, lobster, and sea scallops.  They were nicely seasoned and cooking temperature was on point.   It was a great time gathering with friends, food was yummy and service was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"The Sahara location is poor. The food wasnt good and service was lousy. The staff made you feel like they were doing you a favor."}
{"text":"Hibachi is not one of those foods or meals I crave, it's always someone else's idea. Dinner and a show is a good go-to plan for special events like birthdays, which is how I made it into Ohjah's newest location.   Order your meals based on your preferred protein, and then the soup, salad, rice, and veggies are included, along with dipping sauces. You can add on apps, sides, drinks, and more but the base meal is quite a bit of food on it's own. Dishes are coursed out and you get to enjoy watching the chef make your meal with fire, sound effects, and commentary. If you're especially lucky, you might get to catch a shrimp in your mouth as part of Sam's show. Start practicing now to avoid looking like an idiot.  My favorite protein here has been the scallops: they're HUGE, seared to perfection, and served juicy with garlic sauce. My meatatarian dining companion liked his NY Strip so much he barely gave me a bite, while the birthday girls loved their lobster tails.   As is expected for this style of restaurant, your experience will vary based on which chef you are assigned to. I highly recommend Sam, who was engaging and friendly; another chef's actual cooking was a bit better (perfectly nailed med-rare!) but whose presence was less engaging."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!!!   Came here last night with all my lovely mom friends and we had a total blast. From the welcome greeting to the chef that cooked the food, we couldn't stop laughing and smiling!    The appetizers were so good. Must try their edamame, calamari, and try their Tempura appetizer. Since our group was so big, we ordered a variety of food and I was able to try a little of everything.  Every person all gets a salad and soup. Salad had some time of ginger dressing and the soup had like an onion flavor! I ordered the scallops but my friends next to me ordered rib eye and lobster. I tried all of them and they were sooo good!  Each person all gets to choose noodle or fried rice and again I was able to steal some noodle from my friends since I ordered fried rice! I was sooo stuffed!  I'm definitely coming back again with the family!!"}
{"text":"Can you say sizzling!!!  This place is amazing! Came in the night before Father's Day. Called in to make a reservation with pretty much short notice and they took care of us. Upon arriving we were seated right away. The waitress was so friendly and attentive. Normally I skip on the soup & salad appetizer at these places but it was so good at this location I just had to indulge. The hibachi grill master came out and worked his magic. He was nice and gave us all of our food just the way we wanted it. For dessert I definitely recommend the green tea cheesecake. It's absolutely amazing. The waitress even brought my daughter extra cherries because her cherry fell on the floor.   Everything from the decor, service and food is so great at this location it's our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Waitress (Lana) made several food mistakes. Screaming kids weren't my idea of a nice birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a miss Asian North America event. Only had a small sample of the food but I've been to the location on blue diamond and I'm pretty sure they are just as good. Was a fun place for an event and enjoyed the afternoon here."}
{"text":"I recommend this location over the one on Lake Mead & Rainbow. Although this location does not serve sushi. I took my family that is here from out of town and we all enjoyed our experience. We had the best waitress & Chef (Sam). I wish I got her name. They were both very entertaining and everyone at our table was enjoying their comic relief. They were feeding off each other's energy. Totally, made this experience stand out over any other Tempanyaki style restaurant. Food was great. They were very accommodating and overall just a great experience."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! WORST teppanyaki I've ever been to. Came here and was not greeted, didn't feel welcomed, no hospitality what so ever (unusual for a japanese restaurant). We were the only people in here besides another family so there's no reason for this. You could tell our waitress was an unhappy person. She didn't smile once and gave us the feeling that she hated her job. She didn't come to ask how our food was amd was hardly even around so I couldn't ask for more tea unless I stood up to look for her.  This is pathetic in my opinion esp when we're your ONLY table. This was our first and last time here. It's literally the worst food I've ever had and wouldn't even pay 10 bucks for the filet and fried rice i had. Filet was supposed to be cooked medium and it was actually burnt. The sauces tasted like complete crap so don't bother using it. The chef said weird things and was awkward and couldn't cook to save his life. I can make a better filet on the stove lol. Salad they give was nasty af. Idk what kind of cheap dressing they use but the lettuce was cheap af too. Felt like some chinatown sh!t. Not your traditional japanese salad. Also the appearance of this place is terrible. Plates and napkins out in the open all piled up on the side. Makes the place look like a mess/hole in the wall. I guess all the people who gave good reviews are not asian and don't know what real teppanyaki is supposed to taste like. The ones in Hawaii are a million times better, even with their worst chef."}
{"text":"Chefs are really good at shows especially flaming onion show was good.They are cooking right in front of you.Food is ok i recommend fried rice scallops and rib eye steak if you choose filet mignon is kinda small portion.Servers are not enough of that big restaurant,first she brought hot soda i couldnt reach her and i went to kitchen and she didnt refill all our drinks.One of the server cant speak english so you cant communicate with him."}
{"text":"I love this place, i am a fan of teppanyaki in general. I have a shellfish allergy and they are super good about cooking my food first before they bring out the seafood. The show is great, the sauces are delish and you get consistent good food each visit."}
{"text":"Great service, attentive staff, wonderful teppanyaki show and Amazing food & drinks!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jane was very friendly and awesome, she helped make the experience even more enjoyable. Along with the Chef who took care of us, very funny! I came with my family of 6, and it was most of their first time being here and they all had a wonderful time.  We would definitely recommend this place to others, especially due to the service from the staff.   Really great place to take family out.  Will definitely be coming back.   Mahalo"}
{"text":"Really delicious!!! Yanny our server and our cook was phenomenal! Be sure to get the the tempura ice cream (delicious) I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"service very good. Especially the ? from Vietnam he's very fun and kind...  But the foods 30% too salty ...  I don't know the other people how the think  Myself like tepanyaki more flavor than soy sauce ... Didn't take pictures..."}
{"text":"Perfeito!!!!! Gostamos muito, diferente, comida deliciosa e a maneira como Ã© preparada com brincadeiras foi sensacional. Pode ter certeza que voltaremos!!!!"}
{"text":"This has been my third visit & each time I am just as happy as the first! We went in for a light lunch so we got the \"Chefs special\" we were able to choose 3 specialty rolls for around $24.00  The rolls we're humongous and delicious. The chef kept checking on us asking if we wanted more, or how we were enjoying our rolls. The service here is friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"if we could give zero stars i would. i love the ohjah location at flamingo, its AMAZING THERE. i tried to give this location a chance THREE TIMES, but's it failed EVERY TIME. the food is practically straight up oil. the food honestly had a smell cause of the amount of oil. the food also has NO FLAVOR. NONE! and if you come (idk why you would), don't get chef david!!!!"}
{"text":"Love teppanyaki restaurants....and this one is one of the best!  Went here with a large group of mom friends and we all had a blast. Staff was friendly and attentive to our needs.   Started with a variety of appetizers:  edamame -- so good and a must try. Prepared with a light soy sauce, red chili peppers, and roasted sesame seeds.    Shrimp and vegetable tempura - delicious.  Calamari - another favorite.   Each of us got a salad with ginger dressing - which I love and can eat all the time. Along with a bowl of soup. The chef prepared mixed grilled veggies at the grill. And you got a starch too - fried rice and fried noodles were factories last night. You could also get plain rice or even brown rice.   We each got different proteins - steak, shrimp, scallops, lobster, and sea bass. All delicious and well prepared. The chef was so entertaining and made the night even more fun.   If you drink, try the peach and mango martini, yum!  Or the Honey Dew one."}
{"text":"What a great place. Everyone that works there is wonderful. Food is great and the price is right. I ordered the chicken with noodles + veggies and my boyfriend ordered the waygu and fried rice. He's generally really picky about food as he is fairly simple but he really enjoyed this place. Our chef was funny and seemed to have a great time with everyone at the table. I would highly recommend this place, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on March 20th for my partner's bday and we loved it! The waitress was kind and knowledgeable and Sam, our chef was so friendly. The food was cooked so well - both my partner and I commented it was some of the best steak we've ever had - and the prices are great! We both appreciated some excellent food in a very easygoing environment. Will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience at this Hibachi steakhouse. The food was on point, and our service was absolutely spectacular!   My beau and I love Japanese style grilling, and we Come from Chicago where there is a lot of option in the Japanese category. Ohjah did a fantastic job impressing us with wonderful personality. The chef was a lot of fun talking to the table, tossing shrimp to us to catch in our mouths, lighting the fires, etc. But the Best was our waitress Yanny, who was super friendly and joking back and forth with us. She was an absolute joy!! She came by frequently and was personable and so much fun!  To mention- the food was fresh and great too. I really enjoyed the garlic sauce they put in the rice and veggies which was unique and delicious. Everything else was hot and fresh as you would like. 5 star hibachi and they hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have frequented hundreds of hibachi places. This one is top notch. We got the combo and the filet was amazing. We were served substantial portions of everything. It was so delicious. I can not recommend this place enough. I can't wait to go back and eat there. Maybe the stars aligned perfectly for this place because our last mea was a 10/10."}
{"text":"I've been too there other location on rainbow Blvd but figured we would go to this new location because it was closer to home. The quality of service was subpar a best the food was decent but I will drive the extra few minutes too there other we're the staff is much friendlier!"}
{"text":"My first teppanyaki in Vegas. Chef Sam was nice and friendly. I had the noodle and filet mignon. Food was on point! Definitely worth the visit! Highly recommend this place. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! If we could give more stars we could! From the moment we walked in we fell in love with the ambiance and service. And the food.... OMG! The BEST teppanyaki we have ever had hands down. We even received free hot sake on the house and a couple shots for desert. We will definitely return !"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. The atmosphere is very nice. The chefs and servers are friendly. The food is reasonably priced for the quality. I personally like the lobster and scallops from the hibachi menu. The desserts and tea are good too. They have tempura ice cream and cheesecake."}
{"text":"This place is an affordable version of the Benihana experience, basically performance cooking. I had the beef tataki and filet minion. The beef tataki was more memorable of the two for me. My wife had some scallops, and they were the largest scallops I've ever seen. Worth a visit if you've never experienced performance cooking on a hot plate."}
{"text":"Loveeeeee it!! Food was great sam was awzome! C ame on my bday with my friend was worth every minute"}
