{"text":"So I am vegetarian and the party I'm with is vege plus no egg.   There was Plenty to eat here.  I'm usually not a pad Thai fan, but this was amazing.  The tofu was nice and firm and had great spice (not just pepper hot but good taste hot)  Also had the lychee signature drink as well as the ginger/lavender infused drink...both wonderful.   All said and done, a must go to!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here - it's always fresh and light. The pad thai is my go-to, but I recently tried the mango yellow curry. While the flavor of the dish is really good, be warned that it's spicy! The waitress told me it was a 2/5, but it definitely seemed like a 4/5 to me - it was quite a bit hotter in my opinion than my boyfriend's Kim Chi noodles, which were a 3/5. It would be nice if the spice level were customizable, but be warned that Bac doesn't mess around!"}
{"text":"Good food, working against not so great decor.  I wasn't a fan of the paint.  There is a reason you never see that 'avocado' green on walls, it is unappetizing.  Maybe I just remember what the place used to look like, when it was the cozy Tortilla Feliz.  Paint color aside, Bac has a great, varied menu.  The heavily breaded sweat potato fries and spicy ketchup were really good.  Bf loved the cold noodle salad.  I loved the ginger dressing on my salad.  The cucumber cocktail I ordered tasted like sugar water.  Worst drink in a long long time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were originally going to dinner at the Southside, but ended up at Bac as a last minute decision. We were told that there was going to be a wait for a table, but as we sat down at the bar, the staff hurried and cleared a table for us in the dining area. The food was really good, and the portions were also very generous (we both took home leftovers). The service was a little chaotic. The bartender began to serve us in the dining area, but then we were served by two other staff throughout our time there. We have also eaten at Charm Thai in Seven Hills recently, and my husband hands down recommends Bac over Charm Thai....he especially recommends their Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing taste and quality! I can't recommend a favorite dish because they are all equally as good. Every time I go I am more impressed! Wish they would open more locations. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place. Had the steamed buns (with pork) to start, and they were simply amazing. I could have ordered a few more and made those my meal. For my entr√©e I ordered the avocado curry. My server told me the spiciness starts at a 3 out of 5 on that dish. For someone like myself that loves spicy food I was okay with that. It had great flavor but unfortunately it was so incredibly spicy I could barely eat it. Every time I took a bite my eyes started to water. Thank god for the side of rice that it came with. Next time I will ask to tone down the spice level."}
{"text":"As we walked in, we were immediately greeted and walked over to an open table. This modern -chic environment was perfect for our late evening dinner. Beth, our server was very friendly and courteous, she delievered A+ service. From taking our order to the fond farewell, she was a positive footnote to our Cleveland trip.  We ordered the Edamame for app and for our entrees we had the Avocado Curry and Kim CHi Noodle. Both dishes we made well and we enjoyed it very much. This is defintely a spot you should try if you are ever in Cleveland, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Bac was just as delicious as I had hoped.  I have been meaning to eat here for awhile.  I was glad I made a reservation, because a HUGE birthday party came in and took up nearly the whole restaurant.  The drinks were awesome.  I had the 17th Parallel, which was different, but tasty.  My boyfriend had the Singapore Redux, which tasted AWESOME.  If I didn't have a bad history with gin, I would have ordered it for myself.  I would love if they made something similar with vodka in the future.  For an appetizer, we had the autumn rolls (on the seasonal menu).   Delicious.  My boyfriend had the chicken basil rice.  Very generous portions and definitely tasted good.  I decided to order the Peking Duck (also on the seasonal menu), in honor of The Christmas Story.  (Did I mention the restaurant has a leg lamp in the window?)  The duck was AWESOME.  Presentation was nice.  However, this was different from any other duck experience I had.   Sliced duck (ok, normal), a mix of veggies, sauce, sticky rice....and tortillas??  Well, I wasn't sure what to do, so after years of eating Chipotle, I figured I would make myself three little duck burritos with a combination of all the ingredients.  I'm assuming this is what was expected of me, but I still wasn't sure.    My little burritos/wraps or whatever...turned out to be sooo yummy.  The only thing I would do in the future is cut up my duck a bit more.  Since duck is generally fatty, it was impossible to take a bite of it and not get an entire mouthful.  I would also be happy if a duck dish was added to the regular menu, and not just as a special.  But I must say I can't wait to go back and try OTHER items on the menu.  For dessert, we ordered the fried ice cream and some coffee.  The coffee comes with sweet cream at the bottom, so nothing needs to be added.  The fried ice cream was fantastic, but my boyfriend didn't care for it, as he insisted that Americans will deep-fry anything (um,why not!?).  Whatever, more for me :)  Anyway, you should head to Bac.  He's a cool guy, and did a great job with this place.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went with family (group of 7) on a Friday night and we were given the little side area to ourselves.  Sister and I ordered martinis and they were strong and good!  They were on happy hour, as were the 3 appetizers we ordered. All good and nicely priced. Among the 7 a variety of dishes were on the table. No one complained; although the short ribs were said to be laking in flavor. I think the curry dishes are the best and I appreciate the protein options. Curry dishes are not for those unable to tolerate (or enjoy) spiciness as they cannot be made milder. fried ice cream was not Chi Chi's style as I was hoping.  overall this was a good meal. nice environment, tasty food, well made alcoholic drinks, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't understand these other reviews. Yelp led me seriously astray convincing me to visit Bac Tremont.   The food overall was overly bland. The Papaya Salad merely consists of shredded green papaya with some crushed peanuts and garnished with some basil. Where's the fiery hot and salty dressing that adds the zest to this traditional dish? Similarly, the Tom Yum Soup was basically 1-2 cups of lemongrass flavored broth with a handful of sliced mushrooms and a couple of small shrimp.   Our main courses were also very disappointing. Neither the Pad Thai nor the Classic Stir Fry have the complex flavors I expect from Asian food. The Pad Thai consisted of a mountainous plate of  noodles that were swimming in a subpar sweet and sour sauce. While the menu indicates that the Pad Thai comes with napa and dill cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions, I could not find any vegetables in the dish. Just the swimming mountain of noodles.  The Classic Stir Fry was better, but still just mediocre. The vegetables tasted fresh, but the ginger-garlic sauce was nondescript and unmemorable.   The cocktails are decent (if a bit overly sweet and weak) and the upbeat ambience can make for a fun experience if you are just here for drinks. But that's about the only good thing I can say about this place."}
{"text":"The Mango Curry dish was great! I was also able to easily substitute menu items.   The staff was really helpful with questions an gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"Just had lunch today on the patio. My coworker and I both had bugs in our pho. They never apologized, and stated since we ate outside it must have flew in. Never heard of a dead bug flying.  She also was a bit rude when giving us our check, made me feel like I did something wrong by bringing it up. No manager ever came out either. She said if there was a bug in the pho she would have noticed it, Apparently Not!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Bac, I've delayed writing this review for so long because I really want to like you, I do: you're within walking distance of my place, you have a patio, I love Asian food, and your 17th Parallel cocktail is one of my favorite summer drinks in Cleveland. Sadly, though, your food and service leave much to be desired.   I've gone for lunch, happy hour, and dinner on multiple occasions always trying something different each time, and never once have I left thinking \"I'm so glad I chose Bac over the myriad of other Asian restaurants in Cleveland.\" The specialty spring rolls and tom yum soup are generally pleasant, but they don't make up for tasteless miso soup, orange chicken that China Town II does better (yeah, I said it), pho and bahn mi which would be laughed at by regular Superior Pho diners (of which I'm one) especially considering the price, and burnt basil fried rice.  I've tried, Bac, I have, but it's not me - it's you. I'll still see you on the side for a drink and a quick spring roll, but it'll just never be more than that again."}
{"text":"We came here for a date night yesterday, and it was quite delicious. The drink menu was neat, my fiance ordered a ginger pear drink made with whisky that he loved. We arrived at a weird time, it was not busy when we sat down, but as soon as we did, about 10 other tables (including a table of 8-10) all sat down within the next 10 minutes. And thats just what we saw from outside. So, it took a while to be served at first, but understandably so. After that, service was prompt and friendly. I like that this place has a lot of vegetarian options and modifications and they truly cater to dietary restrictions.  My fiance ordered a vegetarian pad thai and i ordered the lo mein. Both were delicious and a TON of food. We also ordered vegetarian spring rolls to start. All of it was delicious with good flavor. The only thing i thought was a little weird were the lo mein noodles. They were essentially ramen noodles. It was still delicious, just not the type of noodle i was expecting and craving. Maybe this is more authentic, I'm ignorant on that subject. Like i said, still really good and the tofu was done well. And i had enough leftover for at least 2 more dinners.."}
{"text":"Yay first review!  I've been here many times but I've never got around to writing a review of this restaurant. A friend told me about this place awhile back and he said that they had banh mi. Banh mi? I was instantly intrigued.  I think the first time I went, I got their Asian noodle salad with chopped spring rolls or what the Vietnamese call it \"B√∫n Ch Gi√≤.\" I used to eat this all the time growing up and I have to say Bac doesn't disappoint with this dish. The spring rolls were cooked perfect and the vermicelli noodles and pickled carrots and daikon were tasty. Their pho is also very good. For $10, you get a pretty good-sized bowl and when they bring it out to you, the thin slices of beef on top are still rare. The noodles are also cooked perfectly; an important component to this dish. Love it.  Bac Nguyen comes out from the kitchen from time to time to actually see how his customers are doing. That's some great customer service right there folks.  Would I recommend this place to friends and family? You bet your grandpa's pants I would. If you're looking for good Asian-fusion food for a reasonable price, definitely check out Bac."}
{"text":"Bac is above average in terms of their food and ambiance. We went for dinner last Friday and shared the savory coconut crepe, which had both shrimp and chicken in it, as well as the papaya salad. We weren't very hungry so that was the extent of our eats, but to drink, we had lychee mojitos, which were just okay. Certainly, the concept of a lychee mojito is very interesting, but what we got hardly tasted like lychee, mint, or lime but more like a long island ice tea. The people behind the food seem very nice, and I hope they improve their offerings over the long run and succeed. In the meantime, they have a bit of a way to go."}
{"text":"I don't claim to be a Pho expert but I know enough to know Bac does it right. I'm pretty sure there is nothing better on a cold Cleve night than stopping into Bac for a hot bowl of noodly, brothy goodness. It warms the soul people! I've also tried their avocado green curry and have craved it ever since. The veggies were fresh and not over cooked like some other asian restaurants prepare them and the dish is spiked with chunks of avocado (nom!). Their food is incredibly fresh, never greasy and super flavorful. They also have pretty decent cocktail and beer offerings. Service has always been great. The place is small so be prepared to wait for a bit at the bar or be sure to make a reso. Bac is a place you come back to over and over again because you just.can't.stop. In fact, all this talk has set my cravings in motion!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm still trying to figure out where all these great reviews came from. What is so good about it? Aside from the cleanliness, or lack thereof, the food was not very good. The pad thai was average, it could have easily been made at home. The avocado curry was better but I would definitely not go back for it. I wouldn't recommend BAC to anyone."}
{"text":"First time here for happy hour and had a great time.  I like Bac a lot. It's unpretentious, affordable, and the food and drink is decent.   My friend and I split the shrimp steam buns, chicken satay, and edamame. I was pleasantly surprised with the shrimp steam buns--I could have gotten another order. Chicken satay was good. Edamame was just alright. I bet you're thinking how could edamame be just alright? It didn't seem fresh to me or of good quality. They also doused it in salt which was way too much.  As per usual, we each had to have an order of the fried ice cream. IT'S THAT GOOD. You can't come to Bac and not order the fried ice cream.   I decided to be adventurous tonight and try a Bac cocktail. I went with the Lychee Mojito since I am a huge lychee juice fan. It was delicious, but it didn't taste like there was much alcohol in it. My friend went with the Pimm's #1 and the Mekong. Both are made with ginger beer. I'd recommend all three.  Also, our server Tony was sexy as hell with his long scraggly beard and man bun."}
{"text":"This place is the ish when it comes to asian food in Tremont. Ty Fun is great but nothing beats the atmosphere and tasty eats at Bac. The owner loves hip hop more than I do so occasionally (on any given Saturday) he moves the tables, hires a DJ and Bac's that a$$ up. Fun as hell. Everything and I mean everything on the menu is good. Try the pad thai and don't forget a lychee mojito. This place deserves all of its accolades. Totally worth a try."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Asian fusion. Some favorites include the papaya salad, summer rolls, mango yellow curry, and shrimp lo mein. If you can look past current events I highly suggest dining here as you will not be disappointed by the menu."}
{"text":"Was there for 2 hours and saw my server twice! The food is excellent if you can tolerate the slllooooowwww service. A little  disappointed by my experience. Good food, awful service!"}
{"text":"Very overrated in my opinion.  Food is okay, service at the bar is slow, and the bathrooms are worse than a dive bar (disgusting). I won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was delivered promptly, although the prices don't appropriately reflect the serving portions. In my opinion a bit overpriced for some dishes.   If you're looking for a quiet place to sit down and eat this is definitely not it. Extremely noisy and loud, you can barely hear another person without shouting.   Appetizers here are ridiculously overpriced, I would say just stick to the big dishes menu."}
{"text":"c'mon!?  you're all excited about this place??  Ambience was pleasant.  Location is excellent... but, the food?  At best it's mediocre!  The server was sincere and eager.. but, apparently a recent hire.  I wasn't impressed, although I wanted to be. alas... just another \"chinese\" restaurant.... this time in a trendy location."}
{"text":"So I went back to Bac (surely I didn't make that up).  We sat outside at the end of the night.  We had great service.  We talked to the server/manager.  We even admitted to writing a one-star review.  We talked about it.  The food was delicious and completely contradicted my experience below.  We will go bac, that is for sure.  Tremont needs more food like this price point and style.   My original one-star review:  So we are sitting at Minh Ahn Vietnamese restaurant on Detroit. \"Why?\" you ask.  We had reservations at Bac for 8:30.  We waited and waited after we were seated at a table at Bac. The hostess lit the candle. We waited. 6 minutes went by. Maybe 10. We noticed no one came. No water, no nothing. Other people were seated, tables were cleared  We waited 6 more minutes. 12-16 minutes solid without contact. We left. You should too. Caveat Emptor."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant in Tremont. Definitely go during happy hour! Good drink specials. My favorite dish is the basil chicken. Really, really tasty. The spring rolls are a great appetizer."}
{"text":"Went there with friends and family for my birthday and everyone really enjoyed their meals. I had the avocado green curry. Great level of spiciness (I love spicy) and veggies were cooked al dente there was enough to take home left overs. I had two forbidden fruit cocktails because the first one was soo yummy. To finish the meal I had the fried ice cream which was heavenly. They manage to serve still cold creamy ice cream in alight crispy fried pastry topped with fresh fruit! light and delicious."}
{"text":"Tried the bento box for lunch. The price for what you get is good. Didn't like the sweetness of the food I ordered (tom yum soup & papaya salad) . My husband really liked his pad thai."}
{"text":"I might call BAC modern american asian food. I was a little disapointed that it's not really Asian Fusion, like Parallax. But thankfully, it's also much more affordable than Parallax. The dishes were all familiar from other Chinese, Thai, Japanese or Vietnamese restaurants.   I had the Yellow Mango Curry. It was very sweet and just the right amount of spice. The portion was rather large, and I was very full by the end. The presentation really needed some work, as it looked like someone just sloped a ladle full of pre-made food onto a plate. But still, tasty good.  Someone else got the Pho Thai. It wasn't as nuanced as Superior Pho, but I loved the way the food was served. A pile of raw, thinly sliced beef was left in the center of the dish. That way, you could slowly add the beef to the broth to cook it. This solves for me one of the greatest challenges of Pho Thai: getting to the bottom of a bowl before the beef becomes completely cooked through.   The service was excellent. They took a late reservation, and had a table ready for us, waters poured. The waiter made several good suggestions.  So this was a very good first experience. I could honestly see this place getting better or worse as time goes on. Time will tell."}
{"text":"Stopped here when looking for someplace of the beaten tourist path in Cleveland. So glad I did. The Vietnamese salad with chicken was amazing, the staff was super friendly and the neighborhood of Tremont was exactly what I was looking for!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday lunch after the noontime rush. Nice decor but still casual -- cloth napkins casual. Our server was running everything in the front of the house by herself, but she was great. The vegetarian offerings, even at lunch time, have more variety than most places we go -- as much as some vegan restaurants. Ordered Pho and a salad. Both were delicious.  This is the second time we have been here. We came back because it was such a nice experience the first time. The one downside for me as a hard of hearing person is the noise level. There was NOBODY else in the dining room during part of our lunch but the background music and the reverb off the hard surfaces made it tough to hear. Just FYI in case you have the same problem."}
{"text":"Great food-very tasty and authentic.  It is nice to see food that people actually make from scratch--no frozen and reheated stuff here!  Thank yo for a nice clean, quiet and relaxing spot for lunch with such great food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  The Vietnamese noodle salad is the best.  The greens and vermicelli noodles have a nice cilantro taste to it.  You can choose barbecued pork, chicken, or beeef for the top...the pork is my fave!  I also add on some spring rolls on top!  Their spring rolls have a lot of meat and veggies on the inside, unlike in Chinese restaurants where it's mostly wrapper.    Another thing I love to order here is their Vietnamese coffee.  I'm not really a coffee drinker but this one I crave once in a while. :-)"}
{"text":"I have discovered this restaurant for about 3 months ago.  And I have been back there for at least more than 7 or 8 times already whenever I have no idea where to go for dinner.  The Pho is very tasty and the portion is hugh, the price is a bit on the high side ($12, I think it was $10 before).  And the avocado green curry is one my favorite too."}
{"text":"Arrived 7pm on Friday night and was surprised when asked if we had reservation, bar area looked empty, but the hostess very pleasantly asked us to wait while she found a spot for 2 in dinning room.  When we walked around corner into dinning room the place was full, but despite the tight seating arrangements it didn't feel cramped and most importantly wasn't loud. I hate places that are so noisy you cant hear of have to shout, whether by design or accident the acoustics made conversation easy despite other dinners in close proximity. And while I do have some favorite places that are a bit of a whole in the wall I found  the BAC's atmosphere a  perfect balance, of course you could show up dressed for a night on the town but also could show up in blue jeans or cycle attire and not feel overly dressed down. Well above the warn out truck stop booths I've seen in all to many Asian restaurants.  I had the Kimchee with pork, It's a fusion restaurant so of course it wasn't traditional, but It was a fantastic blend. Having read some criticisms here I find it odd , I love both traditional and different fusion blends I've had, for me it doesn't have to be and either or. The portions were large, great for that night having had the means to carry the leftovers home  for a second meal but when I arrive by bike I'll have to try something off the lighter menu. Service was great, attentive but not over bearing, staff was busy but friendly and pleasant, taking our order and food delivery  came in very reasonable time.  Overall I  would give my experience a 5 star rating, I choose 4 only because it was my first time  there and  feel 5 stars should be reserved for consistent hi quality over different entrees and visits. I will defiantly be returning and have no qualms about recommending others, if my single experience repeats it self in the same manner I would/will give it a 5 star"}
{"text":"A fantastic place to go for happy hour or dinner. The portions are huge, so be sure to get an app (the Goyza Dumplings are amazing!) and you are fine to split an entree between two people. Almost every time I go I get the Kim Chi Noodles because they are so good and it has a bit of a kick to it, if you want to venture out try the Lo Mein. Such a tasty, garlicky sauce it is far from blah.  I tend to get carry out but be sure to sit in the bar area if you visit since it is such a nicely designed bar and dining area."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at BAC in Tremont Saturday night.  We had no reservations, so we ate in the bar at a table that was perfect for us.  Started with crab cakes that were tasty and came with a wonderful aioli.  I had the noodle  salad; oh so good! My husband had the Pad Thai, his favorite and it was as good as it gets.  The decor, music and vibe were perfect. Our server was also  in charge of the bar and we could not get over just how pleasant she was.  Great beer selection and everyone there was so welcoming! Next time we will call and get reservations to take the whole family."}
{"text":"Made a reservation at Bac tonight at 8pm. We were seated at 8:05, waited at out table until 8:25 and then left after not one employee visited our table."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. If you are a vegetarian you must try the Mango Yellow Curry , it is just awesome.  You can't beat the price for a quality Thai food"}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous about eating Vietnamese food in trendy Tremont, but I like it. Sometimes.   I will start with the good.  Drinks are really unique and they taste great. I could drink 17th Parallels all day long. Happy hour has really great specials. Though the banh mi is good, it isn't a true banh mi.  And then the mediocre... I really love green avocado curry tofu. Half of the time. Sometimes when I order it at the base spicy level, it's super bland and not spicy at all and I will add hot sauce which really changes the flavor. Other times, ordered at the same level, it's burn your mouth spicy. I need that, all the time. I guess it just depends on who's cooking but I'm scared that if I order it really really spicy, that it will be inedible. Consistency is good. NOTE TO SELF: Never order Vietnamese Iced Coffee with condensed milk because it's not what it should be, it's a melted watery mess.  Another visit, a friend ate a bowl of pho and the server asked her if she'd had it before. She said no, so the server was telling her \"how\" to eat it, describing hoisin sauce as really garlic-y. I've been eating hoisin sauce since I was a child and while it may have garlic in it, it's not a garlic flavored sauce.   I also hate the trendy and club/house music that plays here.   I mean, don't get me wrong, I like the  food, drinks, and decor but I would enjoy it a lot more if they could get the flavors to be consistent."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in clevo. Super fresh, super tasty, super reasonable. Big suggestion- try some of the less traditional dishes.  The bacon guac? Hands down my favorite guac in cleveland (better than the Mex/mod place up the street). Great restaurant, good service with a personal touch (if your food is brought out from the kitchen by a friendly dude with glasses and an apron, that's probably Bac)."}
{"text":"Great food, just not very attentive staff. Took forever to be greeted on a slow afternoon, and was checked on so infrequently I could have bailed on the check."}
{"text":"YUM. Had been meaning to go here for years and am kicking myself for waiting so long. Service was friendly, prices were good, food was delicious and portions were generous. My husband and I split two small plates and one large plate (dumplings, steamed buns, and lo mein) and still had enough leftover for at least 2 more meals. We also had the fried ice cream for dessert...like a scoop of ice cream inside of a piping hot doughnut. Can't recommend that enough!"}
{"text":"Yo Yo Yo!  Dis place is da bomb son!  Straight up 187'd my hunger with sick flavo combos.  Pork Chop and Egg??!!! You know how we do it!  Green Papaya Salad?  I hit that shiz as hard as I hit the streets - nawimsayin?  Banh Mi Sammich?  Bomb Mi is more like it!  Holla at ya boy!  Big ups to Asians reppin in the 216.  Stay on ya grind, Bac."}
{"text":"This review is based on the pho at Bac, not on any of their other food.  I hadn't had pho in quite a while so decided to try it out here.  It was decent, but not great.  The service and environment here are good, but if I go back I will try something else."}
{"text":"Really solid Asian fusion. They do a good job. Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious."}
{"text":"I just went to Bac for the first time in at least two years and damn if I'm not kicking myself for staying away so long , especially because there was absolutely no reason I stopped going there (well, no reason other than the fact that there are a lot of great restaurants in CLE and I just tended to go to the same ones over and over and again). A friend and I met there for lunch and both goth the Bac Bento Box deal, and what a deal it is! You can get 3 choices for $9 or 4 choices for $12. We each got 4 different items (for a total of 8) so we could try a little of everything and it was all so good. You can get everything from a refreshing green papaya salad to savory sweet potato tempura fries; classic bahn mi sandwiches (with a variety of toppings, to fit any preference) to crispy spring rolls.   In addition to the food, the decor is incredibly well thought out and designed: the dining area, patio, chopsticks, patio umbrellas and menus all share a similar color palette and design aesthetic. In some restaurants, you can tell that they're paying much more attention to the look of the space than to the quality of the food. In this case, though, the attention to detail to the space is clearly carried over from the attention to detail in the kitchen.   I may have taken an unintentional break from Bac, but I will absolutely not be making that mistake again."}
{"text":"I had the short rib stew with chili oil last night and it was the most delicious meal I've had this year. Everyone at my table wanted more of it after they tried it. Had to write a review asking for Bac to put it on the regular menu. Wow that was amazing. I wish I knew how to replicate it because I'm afraid it will drop off the specials menu soon."}
{"text":"dined many times and absolutely adore bac, both the man and the restaurant itself.  great food, fun seasonal dishes, fantastic staple comfort foods.  staff is always above and beyond friendly and accommodating, Bac always finds time to come out and say \"hi\" and to see how your food is, and the prices are right where they should be.  patio is a great bonus and the $5 happy hour is awesome! be sure to try the Vietnamese noodle salad: layers of flavor here with your choice of pork, beef, shrimp, chicken, tofu or spring rolls atop warm rice noodles with lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber and sweet garlic vinaigrette.  delicious!  also, the bahn mi is a must have, whether you like it with 4 types of pork or tasty tofu - yum! go if not just to have a whiff of the pho and sip on a beautifully crafted cocktail on the patio.  this is the type of place you can go after work, for a date, birthday dinner, girls night, you name it!  great for groups, kids, any occasion."}
{"text":"Only reason I've given Bac 2 stars. Is it used to be great last two times I've ordered to go. The pad ti I used to adore had hard rice noodles and this time months later it is extremely dry with little flavor used to be full of great flavors the peanut  sauce was excellent. Bacon guacamole had good guacamole flavor on top of the bacon which you could taste but wasn't over powering. Now you can't even tell their is bacon in it had to cook and add extra to give it any bacon flavor plus add lime juice all it seemed to have was avacado and spice it was OK but I can make better at home. Come on Bac their  is nothing special about this place anymore. I'm not a picky  person. But at 25 bucks for pad ti and guacamole and 2 bucks for extra won ton chips PLEASE IMPRESS ME. Now just going to order pad ti from a simple cheaper place. I'm no expert by any means first time I ever tried it was at Bac loved it. So disappointed. Was craving it and drove from Columbus was so excited and we'll it is less than average.  Sorry but it was and tasted like blah."}
{"text":"i've been here twice and have really been dropping the ball on my yelp reviews. whoops. that's what applying to grad school and preparing to move across the country will do to you.  ANYWAY, both times i've been, i've had the family meal, which basically means an insane amount of food for somewhere around $18 a person. the papaya salad is awesome, it is probably my favorite thing here because i know if i wanted i could eat my body weight equivalent of it.  i've had the tom yum, the banh mi, the mango chicken curry, the pad thai, and something else that i don't remember. i have no complaints about any of it, aside from it being too spicy but that's because i'm a baby. i've been trying to build my tolerance.  last time i was here, it was for my birthday, so not only did i have a gigantic meal, i also delved into the world of cocktails. they were delicious. once again, i have no clue what i had (this review is so totally helpful isn't it?) but one tasted like an orange julius, and one was seasonal and had black peppercorns in it. i recommend both. we were also treated to the green tea ice cream due to the festivities, and it was so good. i don't even like ice cream (see my jeni's review) but this was great.  bac is a dude, and definitely knows how to work the tables chatting with everyone. he is always there, and it's awesome to see someone work really hard and have the food/drinks/atmosphere show for it. totally recommended."}
{"text":"I have to hand it to Bac!  He has put together a great establishment with great food and a great atmosphere. Presentation is always above average with a comfort food flare that makes you feel special (even if you're not). My only complaint is that I can't get his fried ice cream out of my dreams.  It's that good.  Don't forget to try it for the perfect finish!"}
{"text":"This place was far quieter than we thought it would be, but we did go on a crappy November Monday night! The wait staff was awesome and friendly, the food was delicious (with lots of both healthy and decadent options), and the drinks were well crafted. The beer menu is also extensive."}
{"text":"A unique gem for the Cleveland area. Inexpensive yet  bold and delicious. The food is unique and true to it's Asian roots. Go and enjoy Bac."}
{"text":"Bac has done a great job! I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Great service, great vegetarian options, big portions, reasonable prices and great atmosphere. I've been twice now for lunch and always enjoyed it. Both times I've left with lunch for the next day and the people I are with were also quite happy."}
{"text":"Anytime a new Asian restaurant appears in Cleveland, I'm interested. Although Cleveland has a few good Asian restaurants, the majority would not hold up to what you might find in LA, NYC, or Chicago.  What makes Bac different from most other Asian restaurants in Cleveland is that you get the best of traditional Vietnamese cuisine combined with a more contemporary bistro.   While the decor at Bac is upscale, the Pho is based on an old family recipe, like what you would find at any respectable restaurant that specializes in this dish.  The quality of the broth stands up to what you might find at any other Cleveland restaurant, including Superior Pho.  However, for the price (10 bucks), the Pho at Bac is a great value, as the serving is much larger than what you would expect to find at any upscale Vietnamese restaurant.  It is easily enough to a satisfy one very hungry dinner and feed 2 comfortably.    However, an even greater value on the menu is the braised short ribs. The flavor of this dish is on par with what you could find at any of the other upscale Tremont establishments, but the price (16 bucks), makes it a steal.  Again, the portion size was surprising, as the pieces of short rib were much larger than what was expected.  It is if the owner himself wants to make sure that no patron leaves his establishment feeling hungry.  On top of all this, there is the option to dine on the patio, which during the mild summers in Cleveland, is a very enjoyable experience.  While I have not had a chance to try everything on the menu, I am excited by this new restaurant and look forward to returning with a hungry stomach."}
{"text":"Great food. Service is great. Price is great especially for the quality of food. I had the avocado chicken, it was very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in all of cleveland. Amazing food, atmosphere, and service. If i could eat here every day i would. My of my go to places to eat and I have never had anything less than a stellar experience there."}
{"text":"I so enjoyed the artistry and imagination brought into the food! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went here on date-night based on the good reviews. I got the Avocado chicken curry and my fiance got the kimchi chicken noodles, omg both were so freakin good! The Avocado dish is pretty spicy as it is but I still loved it. My fiance got the kimchi dish with extra spice and he absolutely loved it even though he kept having to sip water while eating! The portions were also really fair for the price. The atmosphere was pretty casual for date-night but the food made up for it! Can't wait to go back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal last night on my first time at Bac. We ordered the bacon guacamole and I thought it was good. Not as flavorful as I thought, but still hit the mark. Our friends ordered spring rolls and the were standard fare. Had a bite with the peanut sauce and thought I would order it again next time.   For my entree two of us ordered the Kim chi noodles. I got mine a 4 out of 5 on the spicy scale. If you like heat then this is the setting you want. Another ordered pad Thai and it was quite large and very good. Real fresh taste to it rather than just processed ingredients. I would order this next time. Lastly was my wife's salad. Holy cow!  Large portion and very good. Healthy choice for the dieters out there.  Only complaint was the noise level.  It made it difficult to carry a conversation with our friends.  When we were seated I jokingly ask the server to tell everyone to keep it down.  She laughed and said, \"I know.  I hear that a lot.  I think it is the ceilings.\"  Small area that doesn't help the case.  D√©cor has something to be desired, but that isn't what I was there for."}
{"text":"Was visiting from oit of town and stopped by for dinner. Nice ambience and innovative fare. Excellent food. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went back last night and tried some new stuff. The crab rangoon, bacon guacamole (!!!) with fried wonton chips, and artichoke pesto pasta were all winners.  Service has gotten a ton better over the past months. Bac still makes an appearance at all the tables and is very warm to his guests. I like it more each time!"}
{"text":"My first visit to BAC, where they recently started doing lunch service, so a co-worker and I decided to check it out. We both ordered from the lunch special menu, and got different things to share. Overall the lunch was quite enjoyable. The main dishes were very good and the small bites added on of the Satay and Spring Rolls were good. The right price for the right portion size, along with great flavors and good service made this a great visit and I definitely look forward to making return visits. I'm glad they started offering lunch service, as it is a great addition to the Near West Side's lunch options to take advantage of during the week. Gives me good reason to come back and try dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Took an Uber from my downtown hotel to try the Pho. When I got there I must admit that it didn't seem as appetizing to me. There was only one Pho option and it didn't suit my taste. Also, it was a slow night and there was only one guy serving and he was not very hospitable upon my arrival. If I hadn't taken a $7 Uber there I would have left, but I decided to stay. Eventually he warmed up to me. I was seated outside on the small patio in front of the restaurant (per my request) and after perusing the menu I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai. I'm glad I did. It was plentiful, flavorful and everything Pad Thai should be. Nothing to write home about but there was so much I had enough to take an entire serving back to my hotel Room. I decided to wash it down with a Lychee Mojito which I found to be nice and refreshing. In my opinion it could have been a tad sweeter but they use real lychee juice for the drink and I'm thinking they may have been running low or something. Now for the thing that rocked my world and made this a 4 star review. The dessert. I decided to try the fried ice cream after the response of my server when I inquired about whether or not it was good. OMG! Hands down The BEST dessert I've ever had in my life!! Seriously, if you don't try anything else go try the fried ice cream. It will be the best dessert you've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good except for one glaring flaw. We'll get to that in a moment.  My husband and I ordered the pork ramen, red curry soup, and pork steam buns. The flavors were on point. The buns were the highlight; fluffy and filled with wonderful, tasty ingredients like cilantro, aioli, scallions, and grilled pork. At $8.95 for two small buns, they are on the pricier side, but worth it. The broth for my husband's ramen was rich, complex, full of flavor and topped with a beautifully cooked egg. My curry soup was full of flavor and delicious veggies and shrimp. Nice and spicy too.  The noodles in both our dishes were where things went south. Rather than the curly, chewy noodles that normally accompany ramen, it seemed as though someone subbed spaghetti in my husband's bowl. My dish was described as having rice noodles - I got the same noodles my husband did, except smaller (angel hair, basically). I've never been served rice noodles or ramen like that at any Asian restaurant (and I've been to copious amounts of them).  In summation, we'll be back, but won't be ordering noodle dishes next time."}
{"text":"Great menu - not typical asian fusion. Apps are spectacular & great happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"The pho soup is a MUST try! I could eat it everyday. Also, I highly recommend trying the fried ice cream when having a sweet tooth craving. ;) The service here is exceptional and Bac the owner always gives us a friendly hello when we stop by."}
{"text":"Fantastic Asian Fusion.  Bac never disappoints.  The food, drinks and service are always great."}
{"text":"Bac is one of my favorite places to grab a bite and some drinks after work! Their happy hour menu is extensive, offering all of their small plates, as well as the bahn mi sandwich, for $5. I tend to order a banh mi sandwich and split another plate or two with a friend. I've tried the fried wontons, spicy shrimp quesadilla, and bacon guacamole - all of which were delicious. When I'm rollin on a budget, I grab a tall can of PBR or Heineken for $1, but they also have a pretty good draft and cocktail selection.  The atmosphere is modern with a nice asian flare and lots of natural lighting. Their staff has always been nice and attentive. Check this place out for dinner or happy hour!"}
{"text":"I only recently had Bac for the first time. It's one of those places you drive by hundreds of times and say to yourself \" I really need to try that place\" and then you keep driving until one day you finally stop.  I went with a few friends and was able to sample a few different things such as the Spring Rolls, Green Papaya Salad and Gyoza Dumplings. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Vietnamese Noodle Salad. While everything tasted delicious it does not stand out to me from other Vietnamese restuarants"}
{"text":"Nothing else like it in Cleveland, a must try. I had the avocado green curry with chicken and it was delicious. My friend had the chicken lo mien and was kind enough to let me sneak a few bites. It was hands down the best lo mien I ever had in my life. She prefers it with the beef now that she has tried it both ways, but the noodles are the star if you ask me. Not that this place needs any more rave reviews, I just cant say enough good things about this restaurant. Way to go Bac Nguyen!"}
{"text":"LOVE BAC!   I love this place. After hearing from Shayna R. that it's the best thing EVER, then discovering the true amazing qualities at a Yelp event, I finally made it back and, behold, it really is that good!  As far as appetizers go, you can't go wrong with edamame or summer rolls. The edamame is great and light, the summer rolls are huge and incredibly satisfying (I've had summer rolls that flop and barely have anything inside, but these were so good!). The papaya salad is absolutely delicious; I've had it multiple times and it never gets old! The Vietnamese noodle salad is fabulous as well! It's super light and there's a TON of it, so be prepared to eat a lot or have many more meals out of this one. I got it with chopped pork spring rolls and it was the perfect combo. The salad was also delicious the next day straight out of the fridge. My boyfriend had the green avocado curry and got it at the highest spice level; it was super tasty and had the perfect amount of spice. The green tea ice cream is one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted! Probably one of my most favorite desserts.   As far as drinks go, I have trouble straying from the Forbidden Fruit. Simply amazing. The service is great, too. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't bothersome and took care of everything we needed. She really catered to our low maintenance nature; no constant bothering, but she was ready to answer questions if we had them. I've also spoken to Bac a couple of times and he's great too! He has created quite a gem!"}
{"text":"I went to Bac last night and had a grrrrrrrrrreat meal. the bartender Beth was super friendly and fast. I had the kim chi noodles they were terrific as well as the pork rangoons. cant wait to come back and work my way through the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"I got basil rice with tofu. The tofu was chewy and flavorless, the rice was bland. The only thing I ordered besides that was a pot of tea and I ended up spending $20.  The local takeout place has better food and is way more affordable."}
{"text":"Mediocre vietnamese food at above-average cost -- sounds like a 2 star to me.   On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, my hubs and some friends visited Bac for a quick meal, on the recommendation of fellow yelpers and other friends. I'm fairly aware when I have high expectations of rating things too poorly because of those (unfairly) high expectations. This was not such a time.  The breakdown: - Drinks. Actually, pretty delicious overall, at an average cost. This would have deserved a solid 4.5 stars. - Edamame and miso soup. Well flavored, however in the case of the edamame, quantities were sparse. I felt like they were trying to make me as skinny as the chick who served us.  - Curries and basil fried rice. Here was where I felt Bac most fell short. There was something off about the flavors of each of the main dishes. The rice was dry and lacked a certain basil-y quality, which I consider necessary in basil fried rice.  Overall, meh."}
{"text":"The portion size is average. The hot wings were very good. I could really taste the kimchi. The setting was a little dull but it was the middle of the day. The service was friendly and fast. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place- the food is interesting and flavorful...the drinks are wonderful...and the prices are really reasonable.  I went with two friends last night.  We started with edamame and the winter rolls.  The rolls were filled with a braised beef and mushroom mixture, and they were served with a wasabi type of sauce.  So good!  Of course the edamame was good...difficult to mess that up.  For dinner we shared the basil fried rice which is my favorite dish there, the Vietnamese noodle salad and the gyoza.  Get the basil fried rice.  A friend recommended it on my first visit to Bac and I continue to order it.  We also loved the noodle salad with pork.  It had a crisp light taste which went nicely with the pork.  The gyoza was not a favorite of ours.  We also enjoyed cocktails, but I can't remember the names.  I've always had really unique drinks there.  If you enjoy Asian fusion or modern Asian, try it.  It's delicious and fun."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. First time I went I got the avocado curry which I couldn't eat because I didn't like the texture and it was served way too hot. But I did like the sweet potato tempura fries. The second time I was debating between lo mein and pad Thai. I asked the server what I should get and she suggested the pad Thai. Knowing pad Thai usually contains fish sauce I made sure to specify that there was none used in the sauce. Contrary to the advertisement of the menu item being a vegetarian dish there was fish sauce in the \"vegetarian\" pad Thai. There was also fish sauce in a number of the options labeled as vegetarian. This was alarming and annoying to me seeing as my draw to the restaurant was a number of vegetarian options. I understand as a vegetarian going out to eat puts me in the position of possibly consuming animal products but it shouldn't be advertised as vegetarian if it contains fish. If you do go here and are a vegetarian make sure you specify no fish sauce in anything. They also use oyster sauce."}
{"text":"Bac is the best Asian fusion restaurant in Cleveland.   I was there on a very snowy day. Because I was stupid enough to think that there will be nobody at the restaurant I did not make reservation, I sat at the bar. The ambiance if very good for an Asian fusion restaurant but not too classy. Wait staff is very energetic and friendly.   We started with the papaya salad and it was very very good. I grew up eating unripe papaya salad in various forms in India but this was something different and utterly delicious. For main entree we had kimchi noodles and mango yellow curry. Both dishes very very tasty and spicy. We did not ask him to make it spicy so I think this was the typical spice level he has for those two dishes. The nice thing was, the spices were not necessarily hot but flavorful. I can tell that there are many different spices and green herbs in the dish, which gives it unique flavor. The portion sizes are very generous so plenty of left overs. We ended our dinner with fried ice cream and it was very good with raspberries and whipped cream on the side and caramel on the top. Over all $25 per person for all this including tip (enough left overs for next meal).   I think Bac is the place to go if you are in mood for good south east Asian food in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Ate at Bac today for lunch with a friend. We shared small portions of pork rangoon and bacon guac. Was a nice light appetizer and very full of flavor. Ordered the lunch size portion of the pad Thai. Was very tasty! I especially liked the shredded cabbage. Good side portion enough for me to take to work for lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Bac. My first visit was this past weekend. My friend and I split a bunch of the the small plate options and there were no disappointments. We both ordered sake sampler sort of things ($14 for 4) and then some beers. The service was good too. I look forward to returning sometime to try some of the entrees.   I tend to avoid chain/corporate restaurants, but they almost look appealing/less horrible when I try to park in Tremont. It's not Bac's fault but it's frustrating that every time I go to the area I have to spend SO much time trying to find a spot."}
{"text":"Bac is the man. I go here for lunch, dinner, and for the occasional pop-up-party.  My favorite dishes are the Noodle Salad w Pork, and the Pho. Basil fried rice and the Papaya salad are runner ups. Service is always top notch. They certainly embody the fun and friendly culture of the place."}
{"text":"I never knew I was addicted to Papaya salad until I had the Papaya salad from here. Sooooo good. Their signature drink (some type of cucumber concoction) is definitely worth the \"signature\" title, too.   Very calming, artsy atmosphere. Friendly wait staff. This is a newer restaurant in Cleveland - spread the word, I hope they last!"}
{"text":"My experience with Bac in Tremont was a bit of a rollercoaster ride - some things were great, others not so hot.   The restaurant is in a fairly non-descript location and looks a bit stark and starchy from the inside. We were seated almost immediately upon arriving which was nice. Our order was taken immediately - we ordered a TumYum and a Miso soup to start out. The soups were absolutely delicious - amongst the best TumYum and Miso soups I have ever had!  However we were served the Shrimp version of the TumYum instead of the vegetarian one despite clarifying it while ordering and re-clarifying upon receiving the soup. The hostess was pretty good about it, removing the soup immediately, and bringing us one to go even though we were done with the soup course. They didn't charge for any of the soups either, which was nice.  However, the main course just did not deliver. I ordered the Tofu BanhMi and my father ordered the Tofu Stir fry. And, unfortunately, this seemed to be one of those places that gives tofu it's ill earned reputation as a tasteless substance. The tofu was a basic tofu, flash fried giving it that slightly rubbery outside, and was completely unflavored or marinated. The BanhMi did have much natural flavor or sauce on it, and tasted decent only when doused in ketchup.   Overall, I would come back to this place solely to have their soups, which were fantastic. However, I would probably have to pass on the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try it because it is always highly rated.  Found the food okay.    Summer rolls were good nothing special.  Shrimp nachos okay. Ordered the Kimchi Beef noodles for dinner and again nothing special. Portion was insanely large.  I can put away food and this was 2x more than I needed.   If you do go, the Banh Mi is good, Seared Steak tips are very good, and Green Papaya Salad is very light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Amazing spring rolls but the main course lacked.  Had the orange chicken and the stir fried shrimp.  Not overly flavorful.  Have had way better."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I went with a bunch of people and we all sampled each others meal.  I got a curry dish that was wonderful.  Everyone at the table was pleased with their dinner.  I'll be going back, both for the food and that it has a parking lot across the street for easy access."}
{"text":"Bacon guacamole is amazing. The pho is huge, and pretty much tied for the best I've had so far."}
{"text":"Bac has become my standby mid-level restaurant to treat guests at. - and everyone wishes they were in town again to eat more!    Unique and inspired cocktail menu with equally inspired beer menu?  Check.  Friendly, helpful service to dig through their rock star menu?  You bet.  Food that makes you yearn for three more stomachs, it was just THAT good?  Bac wouldn't have it any other way.  Throw in some solid happy hour specials, modern (yet cozy) ambiance, and the overall happy feeling that you get while eating makes Bac a force to be reckoned with.    Side note, on their spicy dishes they have three levels of hot:  medium, hot and \"family hot.\"  Feeling like a BA, I ordered family hot and for the first time ever in Cleveland, the heat made me pause before my next bite.  Just a heads up if that is (or isn't!) your thing."}
{"text":"I have been to Bac twice now and continue to be thoroughly impressed and well fed. The first time I went I had the wok seared steak tips. They were so tender and delicious.  2nd trips had the bacon guac which was to die for. Also had the pad thai. The servings are huge and everything is always seasoned to perfection. The only thing I would change is the pad Thai was a bit over salted. We always have a great meal there with great service. The chef himself even pops out to ensure everything is to our satisfaction.  I would honestly be surprised if someone was not happy with their experience there. I want to go all the time."}
{"text":"I have been to Bac many times but tried the tofu spring roll vermicelli salad for the first time. I have a seafood allergy so I had to get peanut sauce instead of their vinegarette dressing. The service was fast- food was good and large portions. Drink menu is great with lots of unique cocktails and STRONG so beware."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/decor: great.  Patio: great. Service: great.  17th Parallel Drink: good.  Pad Thai, crabcakes, spring rolls: good.  Coconut milk crepe: great.    Very cool location, great people watching on the patio.  Go see the \"Christmas Story\" house while you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Haven't written a review in over a month due to an overwhelming schedule, but I had to take time to note about Bac. The food was great, the service was even better.  I'm in Cleveland for work, been traveling non-stop lately and feeling especially miserable. Was looking for some Asian food when I stumbled across Bac, Asian Fusion, didn't expect much. I got there during happy hour ($5 starters so I got 3...), there was only 1 waitress so took a bit of time, but she was exceedingly nice. When you are alone in a strange city, a friendly smile really goes a long way, and nice service at a restaurant after a miserable long day makes such a difference.  The food was delicious, more fusion than Asian, but awesome nontheless. I got the coconut crepe, gyoza, and lemon grass crab cakes. Coconut crepe was my favorite, I ate it so fast I didn't even stop to snap a photo! Crispy on the the outside, tender and moist on the inside, stuffed with crunchy bean sprouts, shrimp and ground pork, good balance of savory with sweetness of the coconut flavor, the texture reminds of a Chinese breakfast dish called \"\". The lemon grass crab cake was lightly seasoned, just a hint of lemon grass, and comes with an amazing chili aioli sauce, I think I will take all my crab cakes with chili from now on. The gyoza was my lease favorite, nothing wrong with them, just that gyoza never tastes as good as my homemade ones, I don't know why I bother to order gyoza at restaurants."}
{"text":"I love Bac!  They have a nice happy hour (ends at 7pm) with drink and appetizer specials.  Their food is really tasty and with big portions, so you'll feel full or leave with leftovers.  Lots of options for vegetarians and vegans.  Their tofu is always cooked just enough so it's not all crunch and it's not soggy."}
{"text":"Went back to Bac and got carryout this time.  Boyfriend stuck with the Stir Fry and got shrimp this time.  He said the shrimp is way better than the chicken (which he called the \"cheap Chinese restaurant chicken\" that's squiggly and slightly rubbery).  I ordered the chicken satay and the gyoza.  My chicken satay was a nice surprise...actual chicken thighs on a wooden stick instead of a shriveled up piece of chicken on a wooden stick.  Nice peanut dipping sauce that wasn't overly peanut-y.  The gyoza was okay...a little underwhelming, actually.  Small amount of filling and I didn't care for the crispy/flaking dough.  I guess I'm used to a chewier dough for my gyoza.  Still, a great place for eats."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and great atmosphere! The owner seems to take a lot of pride in his restaurant, and it definitely shows!   We had a VERY late dinner last Saturday, but they were still very friendly and happy to serve us. We tried their newest dish, the avocado curry chicken. It doesn't sound appealing, but it was DELISH. Definitely a favorite for those who enjoy spicy food. My favorite dishes were their papaya salad and shrimp quesadilla. Both had a perfect blend of different ingredients and were very refreshing.   So if you're ever in the area of Tremont, or are planning a trip to Cleveland, make sure and stop by Bac Restaurant. It's definitely a fresh twist in Asian-American fushion cuisine!"}
{"text":"Very intimate space bordering on claustrophobic, but I enjoyed it. Some interesting flavors, nicely presented. I went with a friend without reservations and we had to wait, but they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I like Bac.  I especially love their Tom Yum soup.  It makes me feel things I didn't know I could feel."}
{"text":"Just got back from Bac, it is not what it use to be anymore. I have been here 3x the last 9 months and was hoping I just had one bad meal. It actually been all terrible culinary cultural experiences. It was bland, meat was smoky/charred.. like the grill or pan was burned and they continued to cook on that burned pan. Sauce was bland, I don't know what happened to the cook. It's not authentic anymore and the noodles are not even cooked well. They can't even get the spring rolls right. Noodles are hard inside the spring roll and the vegetables were not fresh.  The pad thai was bland, noodles were soggy, overcooked, and chicken tasted burned charr. The noodle salad was bland, sauce was bland, meat was burned/charred. The dinner tonight was inedible. The wait staff was slow even though there was only 3 tables outside with 2 waiters. They were inattentive. I'm sad that I won't be back here again because I live so close to Bac now.     Bac use to be my go to.. not anymore. Very sad!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of my clients brought me here for a business lunch and wow! The diversity of the menu is great. No matter what your feeling like you can find anything. From Red Curry to Lo Mien to Pho it's all there. I opted for the days special which was Ramen with kimchi and pork belly topped with a sunny side up egg! It was delicious. My co worker got the Pho and my client opted for the Lo Mien. It was all fantastic. The staff was amazing as well. Our server walked us thru the menu and made recommendations (like telling me to get the ramen special... Thank you!) I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Bac I feel like I'm welcomed and regardless of the season (they have a seasonal menu options of entree's, dishes and beers that changes as the year goes round) I have sooo many options to choose from!  My favorite is the Kimchi Noodles that can go from a mild to spicy or even EXTREMELY spicy but if you aren't ready....just keep it simple and don't bitch about it was too spicy (that's rude and your fault if you can't handle it).  The Pad Thai is awesome and so is the Vietnamese Noodle Salad and recently I found that they make a damn of Pho as well!!!  I like the simplicity of it all and the dishes.   It's my go to place that isn't super pricey, decent decor, menu...seasonal or otherwise along with the beer, wine and drink selections!!!   Honestly everyone I've taken there has been pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Bac rocks! We walked in on a busy Friday night without a reservation and were seated at the bar because that's all that was available. This was fine for us; the bartender took great care of us. Beef pho was what I was craving, and beef pho is what I got. It didn't disappoint: tasty beef, and rice noodles to be slurped right up. My dining partner's mango curry was pretty good. The spring rolls were great, but the \"tempura\" sweet potato fries were not: a big plate of heavily breaded and deep-fried sweet potato chunks. It looked like an item off of a bad kids' menu. We'll avoid that appetizer in future. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Bac Nguyen did a great job with his Asian Fusion menu. The restaurant itself is trendy and upbeat with amazing service. I came here with a friend and we ordered a few items so we could get a taste of what this place offered.   Being a sucker for fries, I made sure we got the sweet potato tempura fries, which were nothing short of amazing. We also ordered the coconut milk crepe, avocado kobe burger (finger licking good), crispy orange chicken, and the green papaya salad (a new favorite). Overall a great dining experience and I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Let's just say this place is now my fav Asian/Thai place! It was that good! Ordered the Kimchi noodles, which were pretty spicy but it's just the way I like it! And the sweet potato fries were so delicious we couldn't stop eating them. Yum, can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere to really enjoy a great meal.  Took advantage of the food week special ( when is it not food week?) and enjoyed great apps, dinner and amazing drink.  Wonderful service, creative \"Asian with a twist\" menu...think guacamole with bacon, yum...in addition to Pho and the basics.  Prices were good and the location rocked, as we were with friends and very close to some other favorite spots.  I also really adore when the owner, who also seems to do some of the cooking, comes out to greet the guests and make sure everyone is happy!  I'll be bac..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant---nice food, big portions and reasonable prices. I came for happy hour and stayed for dinner.  The happy hour is good---lots of interesting cocktails for $5-7. The drink orders in my party were the Tokyo-politan (cranberry-ish cosmopolitan---very nice), Jasmine Divine (sake and ginger---nice, but expensive for water-down sake) and Singapore Redux (lots of pineapple, lots of booze). Also, we had the famous coconut milk crepe---which is tasty and a good deal at happy hour.  On to the main course....holy papaya salad! That is one tasty salad, and I strongly recommend it. The crab cakes were standard and the miso soup looked standard and was a good portion. We had a special that was \"red curry stew\" and ordered it spicaaay. (They don't mess around with the spice, it nearly burned my face off.) Unless you're a seasoned Thai veteran who eats chilis all the time, stay away from going super hot!!! The stew was....ok. It was basically a watered-down curry.  One of my favorite things was the portions! There looked to be good sizes for every entree. (Our party of four ended up splitting two of them.) Overall, a good restaurant---but they could have some more fun with the fusion aspect."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Food is OK at best, but nothing special. The pad thai lacked one major thing, flavor. The crab cakes were fine, but they tasted as though they were pre-packed from the grocery store. The Bacon Guac was tasty, but that's about it. Some enjoyed the papaya salad, I fount it to be bland, lacking once again, flavor. The orange chicken was okay, but for just okay it's not worth a third try. I really had hoped to enjoy this place the second time around, but sadly I was disappointed, not only with the food, but the service. Our waitress even admitted that she's a bad waitress. Such a dope!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Bac several times and each time it has been pretty delicious. I only gave it 4 stars because I can't say that the food I have had was the most delicious fusion food I have ever had, but it would be a 4.5 stars if I could. I (or my friends) have had the Coconut Milk Crepe, the Vietnamese Noodle Salad, the Pad Thai, the stir fry, and the pork chop.  I almost think that the food is a little too fusion-y; the asian flavors are a little too toned down and I wish they weren't. Don't get me wrong the food is good. It's definitely tasty enough to keep me coming back, but for me,  the real star of Bac are the delicious, amazing wonderful cocktails. There are cocktails with lychee flavors, crysanthemum, chili sauce . .  they are really fantastic.   The ambiance is modern contemporary - feels both intimate enough for a date, but is a versatile enough place to bring a group.  The outdoor seating is nice too, now that summer is finally here.  Also, parking is abundant, which is nice. Overall I'm a fan. Good job Bac!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and the food n martinis were AMAZING!!  I am a serious foodie and my husband n I could tell that the chef/owner really put both creativity n attention to detail in his dishes. The singapore redux is one of the best martinis I've ever had...sweet at first then deliciously spicy. The coconut milk crepe was incredible. Loved it n will definitely be going back. Did feel bad for them that the Yelp girls(for the Yelp party) destroyed the stylish decor with their cheap flower pots n pens. Even drug companies don't give pens anymore...who thought pens would be hip, fun party favors?  U should try this place. U won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We got take-out from Bac a few nights ago and every single thing was delicious: - shrimp & chicken pad Thai - veg. fried race - chicken lo mein - tofu kimchi noodles - tempura sweet potato fries  Not surprisingly, everything truly tasted even better the next day. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was very salty and I would not order it again. The drink I ordered was good though."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I were having a date night.  She had the kids covered & I had a night off!   Honestly, I've been putting off going to BAC for a while.  Asian fusion..meh...over-done I say!  But via the AMAZING YELP reviews, I reconsidered.  Thank you fellow Yelpers!  When G suggested we go for dinner early (6pm) so as to make sure we got a table, I was like, huh?  When I walked in at 6:05pm the hostess asked if I had a resi.  No, I replied, & then the deer in headlights & look of fear crossed her face.  She suggested a row of high tops in the bar.  Ok I said.  Relief blew across her face.  (I'm guessing she gets yelled at often by mean customers...either that or I look mean.  It might be one or both.)  The service via the bartender was S.L.O.W.  gratefully, my friend & I weren't in a hurry. The food was good & HUGE portions.  I couldn't believe how fast the food came to our table.  Nice vegetarian options too.  A man check on us from the back of the house, I'm assuming either the chef or the owner.  I thought that was a nice touch.  Will I go back? Heck yes!  And I'll make sure to make a resi & maybe take my beau the next time!  Bac you Rac!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and got the orange chicken and jasmine tea. The food was pretty good, but the service was not. Our waiter came to our table several times while we were deciding what to order, but once we got our food he never came back."}
{"text":"I took my fiance here Friday night and we pretty much stuffed ourselves silly!  The smell was gone so bring in the 5th star!  The bacon guac and pork rangoon was just as delicious as last time and I ordered the special orange chicken that was very, very good.  The fiance ordered the short ribs and was very pleased with his dish.  He described it as the perfect Asian comfort food.  Even though we were stuffed to the gills, we decided to go big or go home and ordered the fried ice cream.  It was amazing! Our waitress was super cute and attentive without being overbearing. My favorite place for Asian-Fusion in the CLE!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try eating here, I've been wanting to forever.  I wish I could give them double stars, because as good as my food was, it was delivery from Skip the Dishes, so I can only imagine how amazing it is dining in!  I ordered the avocado green tofu curry, delicious! I've realized that finding somewhere that delivers on spice is rare, is they do not disappoint.  It was flavorful and spicy.  If I'm not sniffling, I'm not happy.  I also grabbed the 1/2 bahn mi, loving that they offer a vegan option (for quite a few dishes actually), it too was very tasty.  I'm very pleased with my first try and can't wait to go dine in with a drink."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 6 to BAC on a Wednesday evening.  The service I would rate as below average.  It took an hour to put our order in, and the whole dinner ended up being over 2 hours even though we did not order any dessert.  As far as meals: The Good:   The Coconut Milk Crepes were tasty.  Solid beer selection Decor was pretty good  Areas of Improvement: The Banh Mi was not very good.  It was sizable for a banh mi sandwich, but wasn't super fresh tasting and fairly unimpressive. The Tempura Sweet Potato Fries do not taste anything like Sweet Potato Fries, but more like batter.  There was so much batter that I'm pretty sure you could have substituted the sweet potato for anything else and it would have pretty much tasted the same way.  Overall a pretty good restaurant, but I don't find myself craving to go back there."}
{"text":"I went with some friends on a casual Monday evening for drinks and dinner. To our surprise they had happy hour going on (score!) until 7pm with $5 cocktails and $5 appetizers. We each ordered one of the specialty cocktails, I had the lychee mojito which was refreshing and not overly sweet which is key for a good mojito, my friends had the Forbidden Fruit and the Chai-yen cocktail. They were not bad but the lychee mojito was my favorite.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, we had the summer rolls (Excellent!!), the crab cakes (yum!), the bacon guac minus the bacon (yem!) and the green papaya salad (decent!). The papaya salad was super fresh and light tasting however it had a very strong anise/fennel flavor which I was surprised by since the item description made no mention to this. I was wondering if maybe the green/unripe papaya has that flavor?   We did not order dessert as none of the desserts piques our interest. I was hoping they would have some playful takes on typical asian dessert dishes such as sticky rice with coconut & mango, thai iced tea (if you have never tried it, you MUST!) or bubble tea! Maybe they will revamp their dessert menu soon and incorporate a few more desserts, fingers crossed!  We really enjoyed ourselves and found the service to be quick, attentive and friendly as well! We will definitely be back, or shall I say Bac!"}
{"text":"Overrated didn't like the food much tasteless no flavors just spices  One star for friendly waiters and good interiors"}
{"text":"Had my first experience trying Pho and it was delicious especially with the Hoisin!! I ordered it for take out and it only took like 10mins which was very nice and convenient because of the fact I needed it quick for my work!! Their dumplings were good too!"}
{"text":"BAC drew us in with the picture of their pho they put on their website.  If you haven't seen the picture yet, it's a shining spectacle of pho erotica: a towering mound of rare beef emerges from a glorious white bowl of steaming broth, surrounded by glimmering, floating shards of basil and crisp bean sprouts.  Enough to merit a trip to Tremont without even glancing at the rest of the menu.  We took advantage of the inviting outdoor patio at Bac, which sits facing one of the dozens of beautiful old European churches in Tremont.  A nice place to linger in the sleepy Cleveland July sun and eat pho. The lunch menu at Bac allows you tag on one of a dozen \"bento items\" to your main lunch course for an extra three bucks.  There's all kinds of interesting stuff, from bacon guacamole to the more conventional spring roll.  We went the boring route, adding a spring roll and a gyoza to our pho orders.  These came out quick, and made a great first impression:  fresh, or near-fresh wrappers, with delicious, gingery, slightly sweet home-made filling in each.  The pot-stickers had that lovely pan-fried texture: crisped on the bottom in oil, then hit with a liquid to steam them throughout.  The pho comes out to your table exactly like it looks in the photo: impressive and mouth-watering.  Unfortunately, though, the pho needs to be re-engineered.  The small bowl is packed with noodles, and I mean packed.  Although these noodles are delicious, they crowd the bowl and leave little room for broth.  The small amount of liquid cools down rapidly at the table, leaving you with lukewarm soup by your second bite.  Lukewarm soup brings any meal, pho, or otherwise, to a crashing halt.  It is a particularly grave problem with pho, since you are counting on that broth to cook your rare beef.     Our pho experience ended with half-eaten bowls of tepid soup and a pile of defeated, uncooked pink beef at the bottom.   The flavors of the pho were excellent - the broth was rich and meaty with a faint sweetness and hint of chinese five-spice, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the accompanying plate of pho fixins' featured fresh and crisp basil, bean sprouts, jalape√±os and limes.  The temperature issue, however, needs a solution, whether it's using bigger bowls, fewer noodles, or simply making sure that the broth is piping-hot from the outset and that there is enough staff present to run the soup to the table promptly.   It's obvious that Bac is bigger than its pho.  The flavors, freshness, presentation, decor, and ambience are products of people in the know in both the front and back of the house; the attention to detail is impressive and the menu selection combines creativity with respect to Vietnamese culinary tradition.  In this reviewer's humble opinion, however, it needs to fix the pho issue to shore up its already excellent reputation."}
{"text":"Nice place to visit after the Christmas Story House.  The ambiance is good.  Great menu selection. Orange chicken is great. Pad Thai is just okay. Needs a little more flavor and heat.  Waiter very knowledgable and gave great recommendations for later stops."}
{"text":"Came here on my bday when I just back after a 13 hour international flight. Unfortunately it's been a while and I can't recall the name of the dishes, but they were pretty decent. I liked the quiet atmosphere. Definitely going back sometime to re-review this place!"}
{"text":"I really like Bac! I've been here several times now and I've always enjoyed myself. Great atmosphere, bustling with people... I can't wait to actually go when it's warm outside!  My friend knows Bac personally -- he's a great people person, always makes it a point to say hi even when it's super busy at the restaurant. He definitely likes to know people! I'm impressed with how he's pursuing being a young restauranteur. :)  As for food - can't beat the $5 bahn mi sandwich during happy hour. The coconut milk crepe was memorable too. Signature drinks are the 17th parallel and Singapore Redux, whichever one had the sriracha or chili sauce.   Be sure to 1) ask for sriracha sauce and 2) try to meet Bac!"}
{"text":"The food is always great but the service is spotty. We've sat outside, ate in the dining area, and gotten take out. The wait staff if usually pretty good but the guy at the bar for take out is such plain terrible."}
{"text":"Vey solid overall--seems like there are already plenty of reviews so I'll just add that the portion sizes are enormous!  You will have enough for an extra meal for sure. I've tried many things on their menu and have never had a bad experience.  Also very good service.   My favorite is the baguette for the ban mi!  Very flavorful and perfect texture."}
{"text":"I had mostly a good experience here. I ordered the egg bacon ramen and the flavors were GREAT, but it seemed more like they used spaghetti instead of ramen noodles for this dish. I've never had noodles like this at any other ramen place I've been. The pork steam buns we ordered were very good on the other hand. I'm sure this restaurant has other great options as well but I couldn't finish the noodles at the bottom of the bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Ive actually never tried vietnamese food but it was so delicious for a first try.The inside was so cute and inviting, lime greeny walls, and dark wood furniture, gave it a cool feeling inside.  Fresh authentic flavors, it seems like the chef really puts his heart into this place and it shows. I tried the Pad Thai, was so delicious, it was flavorful, and like i said this was my first dive into a new food and i was thoroughly impressed by how good it was. Also tried the KImchi noodles, again it was a flavor explosion in my mouth! Service was a bit slow, and there was not too many people when i visited so im not sure what the hold up was but all was forgiven when i actually got my food. Great bar and cocktails, perfect for a date night.   its a little on the expensive side, but i totally get why, the seasonings and ingredients BAC uses in their food is authentic which must be costly for them so all in all its worth the price hike. I recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good vietnamese/pan asian food.!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great. Went with three coworkers around 7pm. The staff was working hard. But they seemed to be understaffed. The meal took roughly 2 hours. Food was ok. A bit greasy (spring roll, dumplings and chicken wings for apps). Nothing truly stood out. Orange chicken was a fresh but a bit bland. The sauce was overwhelming after a while. There were other menu items that I'd try next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some authentic Asian food, it's definitely not here. However, this place has some very delicious Asian fusion food!   Here are some things I tried:  - The sweet potato fries appetizers are one of a kind! Rather than being your typical crispy fries, these have chunks of fried flour on them. I know this sounds kind of weird, but it was really good! The sauce that came with it had a hint of ginger and tangerine. Yummy!  - The papaya salad appetizer was very, very delicious! It had a sweet and sour flavor, topped with some chunks of peanuts. Very refreshing! The portion size was also very generous. - The kim chi noodles dish was very unique! The dish came with glass noodles, which perfectly accentuated the taste of the kimchi :) I ordered it with the chicken, and the taste was simply perfection. The portion size was also humongous! Definitely worth the $14 I paid for it.   Overall, I was very pleased with this restaurant. The servers were very friendly. The cook/owner (?) even came around our table to make sure everything was all right :) You can also tell that they put a lot of effort into making their restaurant unique, with the many interesting decor. I think this place is definitely worth a try! Be prepared to drop at least $20/person though! The dishes can get pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Killer Asian fusion. I got the avocado green curry - It was perfect. A little spicy for me but delicious! Nice atmosphere, definitely worth a visit.  It was a little chilly tonight but next time, the patio would be a prime spot to sit!"}
{"text":"avocado green curry w/ shrimp avocado green curry w/ shrimp avocado green curry w/ shrimp  such a spledid, original cocktail menu their happy hour is dangerous (yes, it is that good)  extremely fond of the green papaya salad  the tom yum soup is devine the bacon guacamole can convert a vegetarian did i mention the avocado green curry w/ shrimp? seared tuna is lovely"}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place in Tremont. Great atmosphere, quick service, helpful staff and amazing food. I ordered the papaya salad with chicken (which was a small plate but plenty big enough for a meal) and couldn't believe how tasty it was. Even on a Friday night, our food was at the table less than 15 minutes after we ordered. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. I've tried more menu items but still the avocado green curry is the winner. And now its open for lunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to get take-out from Bac. The food is consistently fresh and flavorful! (With an appropriate amount of heat!) In fact, I'm never worried about the quality of the food that I'm eating, unlike some of the other restaurants around town. Some of our favorite dishes are the steam buns, the Vietnamese noodle salad, the Avacado curry and the beef pho. If you're around for lunch, their bento boxes provide a few delicious bites of some of their best dishes. They do have a pretty good happy hour during the week. Just make sure you get there before 6PM!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice, relaxed vibe, a patio for dining in warm weather, and a great menu. I could make many meals from the appetizer menu alone. We went for dinner as a group of three and shared 3 apps and 3 mains, and it was way too much food. We started with the dumplings, which were my faves, the papaya salad, which was light and super fresh, and the spring rolls. All were most excellent. I had the yellow curry with chicken, hubby got the Vietnamese style noodles (a lot like bun) and our friend had the red curry with noodles. The spice level is pretty high here, but I found it just to my taste, and the flavors were exceptional. Had we known the entrees were going to be so big, we would have split 2 (after all those apps) and been fine. Happy hour features $5 bahn mi, appetizers and specialty drinks. I went for the Saint Basil the Great, which was gin, St. Germaine, lemon juice and muddled basil. This was a most refreshing concoction on a warm summer's eve, and I would go again on this one. We all ordered different drinks, and I got sample my companion's, and all were great. Good food, good drinks. Good job, Bac!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! I had heard mixed reviews of Bac for the past few months. I even had someone tell me flat out \"don't go to Bac!\" I'm glad I didn't listen.   Very cute little asian fusion joint. The ambiance was almost perfect. I loved the greens and browns and the lighting was comfortable.  We started off with cocktails. I chose the Singapore Redux Reloaded. I was given a warning by the friendly server that it was \"very spicy\". He was right. I loved it. My dining partners chose the 17th Parallel -- very refreshing.   For appetizers, we chose the bacon guacamole with crispy wontons and the summer rolls with peanut sauce. Both were scrumptious. I fell in love with those wontons.   Entrees? Kim chee noodles with beef, avocado green curry, beef pho. All dishes were much better than I expected them to be. Spiced perfectly, presented perfectly, huge portions!   We didn't skip dessert. We tried the fried ice cream and the flan. Flan was just flan. The fried ice cream was interesting and a bit different than any other fried ice cream I've tried. It had a very crispy and fluffy exterior, almost like a baked good was surrounding it.   Service was friendly, attentive, and informative.  Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by Bac. And speaking of -- Bac made an appearance at our table. Super nice guy!   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A friend took me here on a recent trip to Cleveland. I had walked by a few Viet joints in the downtown area and was thinking I'd be better off not paying a bunch for a mediocre bowl of pho. My friend assured me this place was one of the better ones in Cleveland.   The staff there was good. First time I ever been in a Viet place that didn't have Viet staff. But these guys knew their Viet cuisine. My friend ordered us Spring roll and the Banh Bao steamed buns. Quite surprised how good the steamed buns were. Some of the best I had. The spring rolls were good too. I went on to order the pho. Usually Viet places will have many different meat choices for pho but this place only has one. I was kind of let down because I live tripe and tendons in the pho. The broth here is pretty good. Big bowl. Barely could finish it, it was so much. My buddy ordered the Kimchi stir-fry noodles from the fusion menu. He said it was his favorite dish there.   Great experience for me. Will probably visit again if I come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Not under or over cooked. My friends ate guacamole bacon appetizer and the BBQ pork sandwich, they loved it.  We will return next week to try something different on the menu.  You should open up a second location :)"}
{"text":"food is decent but over priced. a bahn mi sandwhich ranged from 12-14 dollars. you seriously have to be crazy to pay that much for one sandwhich....really they cost at least 5 bucks. if you want authentic food, I spend money at a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Really impressed with  the food. Strong, bold flavors that are carefully balanced so as not to overwhelm the palate. Shrimp quesadillas were so good. The cheese is high quality and the mango salsa that comes with it compliments it very well. The kimchi noodles were great, and the basil fried rice was also solid. Not too oily, and the slight charring on the rice indicates it was cooked properly at a high enough heat to really bring a new level of flavor out of the otherwise simple ingredients."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot! I am one of those asian food snobs, and though this is an Asian fusion place (not traditional asian food) it is delicious! I love their lunch deals."}
{"text":"We went to BAC after reading great reviews of the place on several websites. Let me preface what I'm going to say next by noting that our waitress was great, friendly and attentive.  BUT the food was abominable. To the point that we barely had a few bites of each of the four dishes we ordered. The pad Thai tasted like something out of a bad school cafeteria with no funding. The coconut crepe was so greasy it was impossible to distinguish any of the ingredients it supposedly contained. The papaya salad had no seasoning and no flavor. And the crab cakes were...of unknown origin. Now we were well aware that the food was going to be a variation of traditional Asian cuisine but this was truly atrocious. Why did this happen? I don't know. There was a game last night and maybe the regular chef stayed home and left his duties to someone unqualified, uninterested or with no taste buds. But at $58 this meal was painful to both our stomachs and our wallet."}
{"text":"I went to happy hour with a friend and for drinks and some appetizers it wasn't that bad. The outdoor patio is also really nice especially for a nice day out like yesterday. From what other people had told me, this place was really good and I gotta say it wasn't a wow factor for me. I give it a 3 stars because we stayed after happy hour and got a meal. I had the noodle salad with shrimp and my friend had the shrimp pad thai. The salad was okay and it pretty much tasted the same like the other vietnamese places I went before. I also had their summer rolls (remix) and that was okay as well. It had pork versus the shrimp and I didn't care much about the pork. It was okay as well. The pad Thai could be better as well...just mediocre"}
{"text":"We were treated poorly from the beginning. We waited at the front door to be seated and there was no host/hostess present for 10 minutes.  Finally when the hostess greeted us, she offered us a high-top table in the bar area.  When we asked to be seated in the dining room, we were told that this high-top table was all that was available.  Diners arriving after us without reservations, were walked right past us and seated in the dining room.  The service was very bad.  The bar maid in the bar area where we were seated was our server. This sole person tended bar, made drinks for bar patrons, made drinks for the other servers and rung all the checks on the register for all the servers.  As a result, she had no time for us.  The specialty cocktails we ordered were very expensive and tasted horrible. My dinner partner ordered a specialty cocktail named \"Mekong Rest Stop\".  It taste just as the name suggest -- like a rest stop toilet.  Do not get this drink. The food is mediocre for Asian cuisine.  I have had better tasting meals at the neighborhood Chinese take-out.  Our server who was also the bar maid never asked us if we wanted another round.  Even stepping up to the bar, we couldn't get another drink. Of course, we were not going to get the \"rest stop\" thing again. We really needed something to wash down the taste of that one. We were unable to get service at the bar. Just so you know, this place is located in the Tremont area -- most of the businesses do not have a parking lot -- just street parking.  Also, Tremont is a very high-crime area. I would not park too far from the restaurant.  The worst thing was the very high prices we paid for such a crappy meal.  One thing is for sure, we will never return to this place ever."}
{"text":"oh so good asian fushion food. I can't wait to go back. Try a few small plates at the bar with their signature martinis or go all out and get carried away with some hot and hipster entrees. I made reservations for my birthday. i'll write another review of Bac after my birthday dinner"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM!  Everything about my meal was GREAT!!   I have been wanting to try this place for some time.  When trying a new place, I usually go for lunch or Happy Hour, just In case I don't like it, I haven't spent a lot of money.   Reviews of BAC were spot on.  I went for Happy Hour, right after work.  I was the only one at the bar, there were a few other patrons dining on the patio and in the restaurant.   The bartender was really nice and very attentive.  Happy Hour includes the entire Small Plates menu (10+ selections) and also includes their Banh Mi sandwiches for $5! Happy Hour specialty drinks range from $5-7.   I opted for the Tokyo-politan, Green Papaya Salad and Traditional Banh Mi.  The drink was expertly prepared with undertones of cranberry and orange liqueur.  The salad arrived next, a full sized portion.  A mountain of shredded green papaya, mixed with cilantro, basil, in a sweet garlicky vinaigrette and topped with crushed peanuts. The salad was fresh, vibrant and sooooo tasty. The sandwich arrived shortly thereafter, this was one of the BEST Banh Mi sandwiches I have ever had.  The bread was crusty on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.  The filling included layers of pate, roast pork, and fresh crunchy veggies.  The sandwich was accompanied by an Asian slaw topped with jalapeno rings.  The sandwich was HUGE, so much so that I took half of it home.   I smiled all the way home, just thinking about this meal.   I can't WAIT to return!"}
{"text":"Went with a few people and everyone loved their food. I got the green avocado curry and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you like avocado."}
{"text":"we all know the food is good here.... all the reviews tell that tale.   now lets talk drinks- #1- Singapore redux- at the first sip you might be confused. and maybe scared you wont like it. but take that second and third sip... you'll be so happy you did. #2- cha-yen cocktail- a smooth mix of tea, milk, thai spice and rum.   i also want to add that Bac is amazingly accommodating to groups. the family meal they offer is well worth it!  oh and just for my two cents- i'd eat 15 green papaya salads. straight up."}
{"text":"The food was good and the drink menu was great!! The food took a little longer than I would expect on a slow night but the flavor profile made up for that. We ordered a big bowl of Pho, side salad, mango curry, and their fried ice cream. It was delicious and the service was great. She came to check on us when needed which I appreciated!! Will come back soon!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Orange Chicken and Garden Salad to go on 6/8/17.   Orange Chickens texture was a little strange. Very chewy.   Garden salad was ok except for the spoiled dressing that was bubbling."}
{"text":"So with a 4 rating my expectations were high. Here was our experience...we arrive at 7pm and had a long 2 hour dinner.  The place was not busy but service was slow and the food took forever to come out.  We sat at our table for long time before I got up to ask for the bill...  Having lived in California the food was average at best.  The appetizers were unremarkable and frankly something I would expect at a 2 star Asian restaurant.   The fusion thing is silly--as it is code word for we will do multiple Asian dishes kind of ok.  Bac should stick to Vietnamese food vs trying to do Korean, Thai, and Chinese food.  Perhaps folks in the Midwest don't have a lot of experience with Asian cuisine but bac is not the top, and to follow up with poor service, no wonder the place was empty on a Saturday night..."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, casual spot. Thank you for the suggestion Yelp!   I called in for a reservation for our group and we were swiftly seated. Funny interaction, we entered through the bar and, while we waited for an attendant, one of the folks seated in the bar area told us there was no way we were going to get in; they were slammed that night. Nice to have a reservation.   They were slammed! There was a party with something like 20 people in the middle of the dinning room having a good old time. It was a birthday party, and the staff took time to bring out a cake and sing happy birthday and everything. Very sweet.   After being seated, it took just minutes for us to get water and to put in our orders for wine. The wine arrived quickly thereafter and we were able to order our food.   From there, the service was so, so slow. And not only did the server forget my glass of wine, but also my appetizer. She apologized multiple times, saying that she was quite busy at the moment, but would try and do a better job getting back to us.   Besides the service snags, and our weird table in the back (rectangular tables should never be shoved into acute-shaped corners), it was a lovely dining experience.   I went with the egg rolls and the pad Thai. The egg rolls were slightly overcooked, but had a nice flavor and delicious filling. The pad Thai -- and I never, ever order pad Thai -- was perfectly seasoned with a heaping offering! I could not finish the offering.   If ever I am in Cleveland again, I would be all too excited to try Bac again, but sitting in the bar next time."}
{"text":"We came here during Cleveland Restaurant Week and I have been wanting to try Bac, so it seemed like the perfect time to do so. They had the best options for Restaurant Week and gave you the freedom to choose from anything on the menu you wanted. They have an excellent drink selection and many different items to choose from on the menu.   Miso soup was good, although that pretty much tastes the same anywhere you go. I thought their steamed buns were gross and wasn't a huge fan of the pork rangoon but our entrees made up for them. We got the orange chicken, which is the best I have ever ordered. It didn't taste too crispy/ rock hard and the chicken seemed quality (rare in my Asian cuisine experiences.) The dish was perfectly cooked and spiced. We also had the chicken lo mein-- they put their own little spin on it, using different noodles than the norm, which I enjoyed. It wasn't dripping with sauce and all heavy like others I have had, but it was super salty. The veggies and chicken were great, though and definitely better quality than other places. It didn't give me the \"omg I feel like I just ate a deep fried cat\" feeling like I usually do with Chinese food ;)"}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations typically when a restaurant says their Fusion. This restaurant had a mixture of Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, etcetera food. We had the pad Thai , which had a thick Gravy Sauce on it, not what I'm used to. And I spent quite a few years in and out of Thailand.  We also got a curry dish, it was spicy, but there weren't a lot of subtle flavors, just spicy.  On the good side everything was fresh made, and the service was good.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious except: 1) honey walnut shrimp with walnuts, awful 2) mango curry was way too spicy despite asking for 2/5 spice level.  The owner was nice enough to ask for feedback, but did not do anything about the two dishes which was disappointing since he could see it was untouched.  It was obvious they use high-quality ingredients which was nice.   I would come back but avoid the aforementioned dishes. I highly enjoyed the papaya salad, the steamed buns, the sesame shrimp, the beef tips, basil rice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before but at last visit we came during happy hour and concluded to just get a variety of apps... and I have to say that this was the most enjoyable (and inexpensive) meal I've had at Bac thus far. The appetizers are all $6.00 from 3p-6p on weekdays.  They also offer their Bahn Mi and cocktail specials at the same price point. The sweet potato tempura fries with chili ketchup are on point-- get extra chili ketchup though because it's really good.  My favorite item by far was the spicy shrimp quesadilla served with a mango salsa.  So rich and so good. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sweet salsa paired really well with the pimento cheese-reminiscent filling."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend from out of town and it was excellent. I've passed it a number of times and heard good things so I'm really glad that I finally checked it out. We got the chicken steam buns and they were so delicious. It seemed pretty authentic and also very trendy- the presentation of everything was really great.  The cocktails are all really fun- I recommend the lychee martini. We got the pad thai and shrimp quesadillas, which were both good. I saw a bunch of people who got the huge bowls of noodle soup and I can see that happening in my near future as it gets colder.  This doesn't seem like the kind of place that you'd need a reservation at because it's not super fancy, but by the time we were leaving it definitely got pretty crowded so I was glad that we missed the wait."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday with a companion.    I ordered a tofu stir-fry off the lunch menu ($9) and a half-portion of their tofu banh mi ($3 extra).    Companion ordered the lunch pad thai and the chicken satay to start.  Service was efficient.  Food was tasty but portions were quite small.  Would likely return if in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered the the Orange chicken, spring rolls, and the chicken satay. All very good. Probably the best spring rolls I've ever had. Nice atmosphere and a great selection of craft beers. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials before 6PM, $2 tall boys, so there's that. I ordered the pork rangoon appetizer, which was delicious. The outside patio is nice, and they have a pretty large food menu which features modest pricing.   My only concern was it seemed like there was 1 person working at the time..? It was happy hour- so I feel bad for the bartender- but that being said it did take forever to order, get drinks, get bill, etc.   Overall great place though. I will be back soon to drop more food on the ground with the slippery reusable chopsticks they provide and overindulge in $2 Coors Lights."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow. Didn't get acknowledged for 5 minutes. Also took long to get drinks. My friend didn't get her second drink for over 10 minutes and had to ask about it. My friend and I both got the dumpling appetizer. She asked if she could get hers steamed and the server said she didn't recommend it but got it anyway. I tried hers and it was ten times better then the fried. I could barely even cut my fried ones. I also got the curry noodle soup. I only had a little bit because I was full from the appetizer. It didn't have much flavor to it and being curry that is hard to do. I think that they should add a sweetener to it. At home I added a packet to Splenda to mine and the flavor profile changed completely. It brought out the coconut milk flavor which it desperately needed to do. I'll probably give bac another shot because my friend enjoyed her noodle entre very much."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  The beer and cocktail menus are great.  From appetizers to entrees, Bac offers creativity and superb preparation.  My favorites include the huge Summer Rolls appetizer and for dinner, Spicy Kim Chi Noodles.  I LOVE spicy heat and several dishes on the menu really deliver.   There are plenty of options for tamer palettes too.  Bac pleases vegetarians, meat and seafood lovers alike."}
{"text":"Good food, good cocktails, OK service.  The food was really enjoyable.  I wasn't very hungry so I picked several appetizers to share with friends.  I enjoyed everything that was served, especially the summer rolls.  The appetizers are all served on large decorative plates with a very nice presentation to them, but we had trouble fitting everything on our table because they were so oversized.  Our table tried several cocktails that were all truly top notch and very well priced.  The service was OK at best.  Our group of 4 wasn't asked about how we wanted to split the bill.  It took way too much time and effort to get that straightened out.  Also, they wouldn't accept my Discover card because \"the expiration date was too far out\" - really?"}
{"text":"After reading all of the stellar reviews from my fellow Yelpers my expectations were definitely high. Nearly 5 stars after 99 reviews? That's quite a feat for a restaurant. Unfortunately, I just didn't have the same experience.  First, I thought the atmosphere was a little strange. Decorated in giant Crate & Barrel mirrors, bamboo and chartreuse green paint, it has sort of a cheesy massage parlor feel to it. There's a small bar located in one half of the restaurant that seats about a dozen people between the uncomfortable saddle-type bar stools and high-tops and the rest of the place is dotted with 2 and 4-top bistro type tables. I didn't get a very warm feeling from the space.  A couple of things didn't help:  It was chilly. Yeah, it's an old Tremont building and it's winter in Cleveland, I get it. But this place was drafty. Luckily we were seated by a heater vent so this helped a bit.  I also think it was a misstep to put a ceiling fan under the can lights in the ceiling. Nothing like a flashing light effect to make you want to leave early.  Our table and chairs were uneven and wobbly, really wobbly. I had to keep my foot on the table base while we ate to prevent our drinks from accidentally spilling.  The music was some strange combination of 90s alternative and techno/boom pish house. I didn't get it and it was pretty loud. Maybe it's a play at being hip and cool.  I just found it annoying. Damn, I'm getting old.  On the food side, it was pretty good. Where the atmosphere faltered the cuisine provided for a glimmer of redemption. Here's how our meal went:  Autumn Rolls - Sure, they're a bit outta season, but they were damn tasty. A seasonal take on a fried egg roll, they were stuffed with ground turkey, apples, cabbage, onion and cranberries. I didn't pick up too much of the apples or cranberries but I found the turkey to be well seasoned and the cinnamon spiced pumpkin sauce was delicious, sweet and spicy.  Gyoza Dumplings - 5 pan-fried dumplings filled with ground pork, cabbage and cilantro. These reminded me of the pot stickers you get when you order Chinese takeout only with a thinner, crispier skin. They were fried a delicious golden brown and the innards were perfectly seasoned. The ginger soy dipping sauce wasn't anything to write home about.  Tom Yum Soup - A spicy lime broth seasoned with basil and lemon grass containing shrimp and sliced raw mushrooms. I thought this was the highlight of my meal. The broth was on the salty side but it had a nice amount of heat and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. I'm not a huge fan of raw mushrooms but the hot broth poached them, making them tender.  Classic Stir Fry, Tofu Version - This was my wife's selection. I have no love for tofu, but for the sake of the review I gave it a try. It reminded me of a sponge with a slightly crispy exterior. I guess that's tofu for ya. The rest of the dish was essentially what you'd expect of a stir fry, broccoli, red bell peppers, squash, carrots, and onions. The ginger garlic sauce was tasty and the steamed white rice was, well, steamed white rice. Definitely better than take-out but not mind-blowing.  The beer list was respectable with a limited number of draught options and about a dozen or so craft beers in bottles. There were also 7 Asian beers, mostly Japanese Hitachino varieties (of course). I found a couple of delightful options in the Rogue Morimoto Soba Ale (ale brewed with the help of Iron Chef Morimoto using Japanese buckwheat) and Itaca Cold Front (A dark Belgian-style amber ale). Props to our server for offering me a glass with my bottled beer.  Our service was friendly and relatively prompt. I did have to wait about 10 minutes with both an empty water and beer glass but our food came out in rapid fire succession and our server stopped by a couple of times to check in. I was also turned off by a large table that sat uncleaned for a good 20 minutes while we were eating. Nothing like staring at dirty dishes while your trying to enjoy your meal.  I dunno, there was just something slightly average about our experience. The food was tasty enough but it didn't blow me away. All of the dishes were well-made and the ingredients were definitely fresh but there wasn't a single one that would make me want to come back. I also thought the atmosphere was a bit of a turn off. Between the cheap, shaky tables, blaring house music and strobe light dining room, I just didn't get it. I think I'm just too much of a meat and potatoes guy to ever get really turned on by Asian food. Sorry Bac, it just wasn't a love connection..."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday a little before 5:00 and were the only ones dining in the restaurant the whole time. Strange! Miso soup, chicken satay and spring rolls were very tasty and the pad tai looked appealing but tasted bland. The green chicken curry was way to saucy and overpowered the vegetables. Tasted like cheap vodka in the mixed drink. Fair prices and the person who was the greeter/Bartender/waiter was good."}
{"text":"Bac is a wonderful addition to Tremont's culinary scene. Bac Nguyen is doing some really great things with Asian fusion food. One of the most comfortable patios to eat on in the neighborhood, their portion sizes are appropriate, their menu isn't static and their bartenders make excellent and unique cocktails. I've eaten there twice and I can't NOT order the bacon guacamole, it's so good. I've also had chorize spring rolls, the bahn mi and several noodle dishes. All of which were well above par. Bac is one of my favorite places to take dates and just really one of my favorite restaurants in general."}
{"text":"Food was great, though limited menu.  Very fast.  Very friendly kept the drinks full.  Trendy, low key atmosphere.  If you sit outside the traffic can get loud as you are on a busy street at an intersection.  Had a good spread of everything.  No leftovers, good portioning.  I would go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has two great things going for it: Location AND location...or and also ambiance.  About the location, it's located near the park in the Tremont neighborhood; which is perhaps the chicest part of Cleveland, so it has that going for it .  We wandered into this place after spending an afternoon at the Tremont Arts and Culture festval.  And we were able to get seated immediately at the sidewalk terrace.  I found the decor to be very tasteful; large green sun umbrellas gave the restaurant a fresh vibe and the waiters in their all-black outfits were sharp.  Sadly, the food was not as bold when it came to taste.  I got the Pho and while the presentation was quite nice and sophisticated...large crisp white bowl,  a pink mound of meat with a ring of of onions around; the taste was less piquant.  I just felt that the broth was not as flavorful as it could have been and as have tasted elsewhere (Superior Pho, for example).  So, while this place gets high marks for location, ambiance and presentation, the chef needs to amp up the flavor in that Pho broth."}
{"text":"I really like the tempura sweet potatoes fries. I also had their special roll that included chorizo sausage and I thought it was a little too dense and packed with meat, if it was the size of the lumpia I think I would have like it better. My friend order the stir fry and it was really good. I had the pad thai that could feed an army it was huge. I thought the pad thai had great favor but I was not a fan of the pickle cabbage it was a little weird and I think what missing was something crunchy like fresh cabbage or bean sprouts."}
{"text":"cozy little place with a lot to offer. definitely recommend ppl come and try something new. the entre plates are huge! i barely got through half of mine. next time i go i will definitely be sharing my plate with someone. probably still leftover doing that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland. I have taken my friend for her birthday 2 years in a row and she's already asking to go again. The atmosphere is so cute and the staff is really helpful and friendly. The portions are a great size and the prices are amazing for the quality of food. The drinks have been really tasty also. One problem here is there aren't a lot of places to park. Despite that it's most definitely worth the visit and I can't wait to go back just thinking of it now."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Bac is without question one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  First, of course, is their amazing cocktail menu. I've had at least a taste of about half the cocktails on the menu, and I loved every single one. My two personal favorites are the Forbidden Fruit and the Cha-Yen cocktail. They are both incredible, and two of the best cocktails I've ever had in my life! They also have a pretty good beer and wine selection, though I always go straight for the cocktails here.  Next is the food. I love the food. The sweet potato tempura fries have a great texture - extra crunchy! The pork rangoon is delicious and I'm a huge fan of the chili ketchup that comes with it. My particular favorite thing to order here is the green papaya salad with shrimp - it's nice and light without leaving me hungry. I also highly recommend the avocado green curry if you're in the mood for something more substantial - I crave it on a regular basis.  The atmosphere here is great, and I've always received good service. Also, Bac often comes out to introduce himself and check in on tables, and he seems like a super friendly and genuine guy. Great restaurant all around!"}
{"text":"This is my new \"go to spot\" for amazing Asian cuisine in Cleveland. I normally go with the Tom Yum soup, which is the best I have ever had and the Vietnamese Noodle Soup. Last night I deviated (just a little) and got the Pho and was not disappointed. I also highly recommend the vegetarian Banh Mi, which is normally a pork sandwich, but they do a really nice job turning it into a vegetarian delight on the best-tasting bread I have ever eaten. Finish this sandwich off with a side of Sweet Potato Tempura Fries and you won't be disappointed.  The one thing about Bac that sets it apart from any other Asian restaurant in Cleveland is the amazing selection of craft beers specially ordered by Chris who works behind the bar. Over the winter, they had Cleveland's own Christmas Ale on tap, but they also had many other craft winter ales to choose from if you are over the Great Lakes Christmas Ale fad. They are currently serving the Dogfish Head Midas Touch, which is my new favorite beer. This beer is not something you would expect to drink while eating Pho, but you really should because the cinnamon flavor from the broth and the honey flavor from the beer go perfectly together. Normally I don't like sweet things, but this experience may have changed that. They do have all of the normal domestic beers if you aren't feeling adventurous, but I really do recommend you try a beer off of their seasonal menu, or any of the other craft beers from the regular menu.  I can't say enough good things about this place. Bac is an amazing cook, but he also makes you feel at home when he comes out to check on your order or just to say hi. It is such a pleasurable experience to eat (and drink) here. If you can make it in before 7p.m. for the happy hour, it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Bac has been on my list to try for several months and I finally stopped in! After looking at the photos on Yelp, I already knew what we were going to order before we even got there. Me, the pork belly and egg ramen, my husband the chicken red curry soup.  We were feeling like pigs and couldn't resist ordering a $6 happy hour bahn mi sandwich as well.   The bahn mi was huge, maybe the best deal on the menu at $6. We plan on coming back for happy hour appetizers (also $6) soon.   My ramen was great. I had my hopes up so high about those two dishes that I have to admit- I was a tiny bit disappointed. I've had better ramen, but I can't say anything bad about it either. The red curry soup had the typical red curry flavor, nothing really stood out about it. And he ordered it with chicken, but we had to send it back because there was no chicken in it. They fixed the problem pretty quickly. The entrees were all around $15.   We parked in the parking lot (free) across the side street, it was nearly empty. Not sure if that would be the case later in the evening. We got there right at 5:00pm.  Definitely plan on coming back for happy hour! I would also like to try other entrees on the regular menu, or lunch menu (slightly cheaper)."}
{"text":"Bacon Guacamole: delightful.    Getting sick from eating there the two times I have been isn't so great.  I had better luck at Ninja City.   This may be a coincidence though, none of my friends have experienced the same fate as I have."}
{"text":"After my wife rejected my suggestion to go get some escargot at L'Albatros, I was able to convince her to head over to Bac and try some of the tasty goodies on the menu. Our visit was entirely inspired by other Yelpers who claimed it was mind-blowingly amazing.   When we first walked in I was a bit nervous because we were literally the only ones in the place. Even up until the time we left not a single other customer was sitting on the dining side of the restaurant. A few bodies had made their way up to the bar but not many. Now granted, it was 5:30 on a Thursday but still, I figured that that's dinner time and surely someone, anyone, would be there enjoying the best of Cleveland.  Well, all I know is that the rest of Cleveland has no idea what they are missing. First of all, 5:30 is the perfect time to show up because it was happy hour and our appetizers cost hardly anything. We were expecting a fairly expensive bill that night but were pleasantly surprised when we left after having 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for less than $50.  As far as the food goes, I was absolutely blown away! The crab cakes and bacon guac that we started off with were good (not the highlight of the meal but still yummy). Next we got the Kin Chi with pork and the Avacado Green Curry with chicken. Let's just say that my mouth is dribbling a bit just thinking about them right now. The curry was especially amazing - in fact, probably the best curry I've ever had and I've tried lots! The Kim Chi was also delectable although I do have to add the warning that the potato noodles they are served with are a bit odd (they taste good but the texture might be unnerving for some who aren't as brave as us).  Overall, I think my wife and I have finally found a place in Cleveland that we can add to our list of favorite restaurants. Do yourself a favor and check Bac out!"}
{"text":"For starters we ordered miso soup which taste like what you'd expect. Steamed buns (8.95 for 2) w/ pork; tender pork & fresh bun. Sauce was complimentary & spicy. I would have liked actual buns stuffed vs the bun taco I got, my only complaint there. Entree I ordered pad thai. I LOVE pad thai. I have to say, it was UNDERWHELMING. No peanuts & a small sprinkle of egg. The peanut/tamarind sauce had little flavor. Chicken & noodles cooked just right though. My hubby requested spring rolls for me to bring home. He told me there was hardly any veggies & shrimp. It was all bean sprouts & bland. As for Service, it was great."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Bac with my roommate one random weeknight and boy am I glad that I did. I have not explored much of Tremont since I moved to Cleveland, but I must say, I'm loving the atmosphere there. I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants in my day and Bac is up there as being in my top 3. They have really fun cocktails that you must try. I had a lychee mojito. Lychee is one of those fruits that is not overly sweet, but paired with the mint, really complemented each other well. We started with an order of the spring rolls. They came out piping hot and I loved the sauce on the side. For my main dish, I had the Thai Noodle salad. It came with a sauce on the side that was not extremely flavorful, but went well with the lettuce, rice noodles, etc. My roommate had the pad thai which was excellent!! We split both of our meals and what a great idea that was. I have had mediocre pad thai recently and am so happy to have found Bac where I now know I can get a very good plate of it."}
{"text":"Went out last night for our last night visiting friends in Cleveland....One of them recommended we eat here at Bac...After reading reviews and looking at their menu I was definitely game.....The restaurant is located in the Hipster section of Cleveland known at the Tremont area....It is in an old multi-unit building....In considering this review I didn't want to be to harsh but there was a few things I observed that definitely caused me to knock off a few stars from the 5 star maximum...One of them was floor and general cleanliness.....The floor looked like it had not been swept for over a week and the general feeling and overall ambiance just didn't really cut it for me...Considering the pricing etc. I expected a lot more...As for the meal we ordered the pan fried dumplings which were good but just not great...They seemed to be lacking a hearty serving of meat in the dumpling and were somewhat chewy. For dinner I ordered the Orange Chicken with Snap Peas...The course tasted average and I was more pleased with the crispy snow peas than I was the chicken. The Orange glaze seemed to be heavy and almost overbearing....The table staff was attentive and on top of their game however which gives me reason to give them 3 stars out of 5. If looking for Asian influenced cuisine again in this area I would probably try out a few of the other restaurants offering the same cuisine before I would return to BAC unless our friends absolutely insisted:-) in which I would oblige because It wasn't a bad experience it was just an average one!"}
{"text":"Bac Bento Lunch. BOOM.  I just answered your question, \"What should I eat for lunch today.\" It's like a box of magic. Pick 3-4 of your favorite Bac menu items and they'll bring out these cute boxes with each compartment filled with little bits of joy and happiness--AKA delicious Bac cuisine.   If you go 3, it's $10. Want 4 items? No problem--it's just $12 then.   I say my only problem was that it was only lunch time and I really wanted to have one of their delicious cocktails. But I was a good-girl and I avoided the boozy lunch like a lame-o. You might not think this is a big deal, but then clearly you haven't tried their cocktails. Friggin' awesome. All of 'em.  Bac--it's not just for dinner, you guys!   P.S. Highly recommended over battling W.25th traffic on Market Day Fridays."}
{"text":"I was fairly hungry so I opted for a few items on the menu: half a banh mi sandwich, dumplings (aka pot stickers, aka gyoza) and red-curry soup with chicken. I thought the dumplings were a little pricy at around a dollar apiece, but after I considered they were obviously hand-made, it seemed right. The soup was very good and there was a lot of it - this could have been the entire meal actually. All in all a casual late afternoon lunch with friendly service."}
{"text":"For me Bac has been a real find. Great fresh Vietnamese and Thai food with a twist. Innovative specials, great and creative mixed drinks.  The only thing I don't like about Bac is that I probably will be working too far away to get here much next year. To be fair though that isn't exactly their fault,  Some if my favorite things: Friendly staff (Chris, Lindsey, etc.), great lunch combos, papaya salad (add the shrimp),  avocado green curry, and pad thai.  I'll be bac... yeah, I couldn't help myself.  Chris"}
{"text":"The food is definitely not authentic, but I loved everything about this place. I came here with a group for my friends birthday. It was a larger group so we had a reservation and were seated right away. It was a Saturday night and they were really busy, which made the restaurant very loud, almost annoyingly so.   The service was great and the waiter was really knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I got the basil fried rice, which I loved, and almost everyone else got pad thai (I know, how predictable) which they raved about. The portions were huge but everything was priced very reasonably. My favorite thing about this place is how many options there were for each dish. I'm vegetarian so having options like tofu is always appreciated, and delicious."}
{"text":"This is a tasty thai/vietmanese fusion place, which usually is not up my alley. I do enjoy the 3 times I have visited Bac however. The food is always hot and fresh, and the chef is always checking on the groups to be sure everything is ok. They have a fun beer and drink menu, with great happy hour deals. A few things I feel are a bit too heavily breaded (rangoons and crispy walnut shrimp) but the curries, noodle dishes and soups are fantastic."}
{"text":"This is the place for happy hour food deals. The ph√≥ is really good too. Clean restaurant, friendly service, and the food is good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the husband and my most favorite restaurants in Cleveland, hands down.  It's difficult to deviate from our favorite items at Bac because they are THAT good.  I typically start with a Lycheetini while my husband debates over which craft beer to order - we then realize there's no resisting the Bacon Guacamole (which is phenomenal). Eventually, my husband succumbs to his urge to order a Banh Mi sandwich (once again) and I'll order a soup of sorts - the Tom Yum and the Pho are beyond delicious (and filling)!  Our favorite place to sit is at the bar where the service is friendly and laidback (yet attentive) - not to mention, the atmosphere is perfect for unwinding (think dim lighting, indie music, and Ikea-esque decor). The patio is also great for those warmer evenings - especially if you're catching a late dinner.  Bac is a must - the first restaurant we think of when friends ask us for recommendations.  Once you dine here you'll undoubtedly be back again and again and. . .again ;)"}
{"text":"Bac is not the food mecca that I was expecting, but that's not to say that it's not a good restaurant.  Came here on a Saturday night with a 6:30 reservation.  The place was half-full, including the outside seating.  The decor of the restaurant is nice enough, but I'm not an interior decorator, and I'll stick to what I know...the food.  Bac has a nice beer/wine/sake list, including seasonal beers.  For apps, my party shared the spring rolls, tempura sweet potato fries, and the bacon guacamole.  I liked the spring rolls, although some in my party were not as impressed, saying they were too salty.  A sweet sauce is served on the side, and I felt this cut into the saltiness just fine.  The tempura sweet potato fried were okay, but they could use a spicy mayo-like sauce to compliment the sweet chili ketchup it is served with.  I didn't understand why bacon guacamole was even on the menu until I saw the wonton crisps.  Yum.  Maybe the best thing we ate all night.  For mains, I ordered the mango curry, and took it at heat level \"4.\"  This was plenty hot, and I'm guessing the 3 would've allowed me to enjoy the other flavors a little bit more.  It wasn't a large portion, but it was enough.  Another in my party ordered the avocado curry, and from the taste I had, it was pretty good, too.  My wife ordered the pho - she said it was so-so, but I loved it.  Much more flavorful than what we have made at home, and the portion was huge.  You have to be seriously hungry in order to finish it, trust me.  Two beers, two apps and two mains for $53 + tip.  Not bad for a trendy restaurant in Tremont."}
{"text":"Service is quick and attentive.  Prices are fair for what you do get, easily more than one meal's worth of food.  Loved the green avocado curry.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bahn mi is FAB! Bento box for lunch is cool. Happy hour specials even better and I am the ONLY person in the place so quiet, quick and personalized ;)"}
{"text":"I finally managed to grab a meal at Bac and really enjoyed the whole experience. We were in a week night and the place was slow so we got seated right away and our server was very quick to get our drinks out. Based on her recommendation for vegetarians, we ordered papaya salad, Spring roles and coconut crepe as appetizers.   Rating for appetizers Papaya salad - Was really good. Shredded papaya that almost looked like cabbage with a mild flavoring. I really enjoyed this one.  Spring roles - were decent. Good - nothing outstanding.  Coconut crepes - was very different than i expected. it had carrots and other veggies in the crepe itself and was served hot. It had a bit more oil than i expected. very mild taste so i did not really fall for it.  For entree we got the following. 1. Pad Thai with Shrimp - Pretty greasy and has less peanuts than expected. My boyfriend commented that it was very different than the ones he had in other places. He orders pad thai at every asian place and considers himself a pad thai expert :O (He wasn't impressed)  2. Red curry with tofu, served with rice- I ordered it at spice level 4 and the gravy of the curry was thick. It was made with avacados, tofus, green peppers etc. I loved this one. It was really delicious and spicy, hot. Unless you can handle hot food, i would advice you to go 3 or lower.   Entree sizes were decent and we boxed the leftovers after having appetizers in the beginning of the meal. I enjoyed the service and food. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Goods: I had never heard of Bac prior to dining last night. I had walked and driven by but never paid attention. I am quite glad a friend recommended we go here.  The food is fantastic! I over ate my Pad Thai because it was so delicious. I am sure you can read review after review of how fantastic everything tastes here.  One other great thing was that every other restaurant was jam packed and we were able to park and seat quite easily at Bac.  The Not So Goods: Bac has great food but their mixed drinks are a bit lacking. My friend ordered two relatively common drinks and they seemed to be a bit off. I had bottled beer so there was no messing that up.  Also, the seating is less than perfect and not all that comfortable. There was a heater under our table that was supposed to heat the entire room. We were sweating our butts off while eating.  One last thing: We had a party of 5 and they automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill. We did split the check 3 ways but I find it ridiculous if you cant handle 5 guests or multiple checks without automatically putting gratuity on the bill. The other guests in my party nearly tipped on top of it because it was so unexpected.  3 stars because the experience was lacking. The food was great, though! So maybe just get something to go if you live near by."}
{"text":"Good service, good ambience, good food. So happy I found this place. I tried the red curry, banh mi and shrimp quesadillas, and all of them were great! Im usually not fond of asian fusions but this is the first I actually really like."}
{"text":"Truly mediocre... Only pho was good, rest of us didn't finish meals.... Warm inside, bad hostess.... Just not great. Expressed hostess issue to manager and he was kind. Won't return."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeeee thisssss place!!!! Red curry soup if the BEST!!! Fried ice cream and crab ragoons are crazy good too!"}
{"text":"Not a bad thing in the menu! Loved the pork Rangoon the best!!! And 17th parallel cocktail - super yummy everything!"}
{"text":"Went with a few friends. Sat at the bar. The sweet potato fries were the best I've had! They had a great selection of beers and cocktails.  Ordered the avacado curry which was delicious!! The ambiance was pretty easy going. The bartender was nice. All in all great food! And I can't wait to go back to try some more! Come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner at BAC yesterday. He ordered the Pho and he liked it...however it's twice the price you would pay at any restaurant in Asian town (Payne and 30th area). I ordered the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai and asked for it to be spicy (3 on a scale of 5). It was okay but nothing that I would go back for. It was not at all spicy and it was dry. It should have had a peanut sauce but instead had some crushed peanuts. What I didn't finish was boxed up...but I tossed it today. We also ordered the pork rangoon which was pretty tasty...however the dipping sauce could use some improvement with less sugar and more spice. The cocktail I ordered was very good and the server provided great service...however the food was overpriced and mediocre."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! I came here on a Saturday night at 6:30pm. When I walked into, I really like the treatment of the staff and I love the atmosphere and the bamboo decorations!   My friends and I shared 3 appetizers: papaya salad, coconut milk crepe, and autumn rolls. LOVED the papaya salad and the autumn rolls. I thought the crepe was a bit too soggy for my taste and didn't have enough flavors, but it was decent.  As for entree, I think I made the wrong call by ordering the Beef Pho Noodle. Now I know only to order Pho at actual pho restaurants. The broth was soooo sweeet and the beef was a bit overcooked. The plus side though, was that they gave A TON of food! My friends however, all loved their order. They had a food special that was beef stew and it tasted reallyy good.   I think I'd like to give this place another shot because I really think it has potential i hadn't tried the Pho. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Bac for an afternoon lunch on a Saturday. Immediately, I thought I had stepped into an establishment with an identity crisis even for an Asian Fusion restaurant. After my visit, I think Bac still pulls off everything well that they are trying to do, and I definitely intend on coming back for more.  The Food: Flavorful, fresh, and unique. For the small plates, we shared the Gyozo dumplings, edamame, and green papaya salad. The edamame was nothing special but provided a nice snack before the main dish. The dumplings were out of this world, with a perfect crunch and flavor, and the papaya salad was exceptionally refreshing with hints of cilantro and garlic and a sprinkling of peanuts on top. For the main dish, we shared the Avocado Green Curry with shrimp which was very flavorful but not overwhelmingly. They said it was a \"3/5\" in the hot scale, and I have to say they don't mess around. If you like spicy food a 3 or 4 should suffice.  The Service: Informative and accommodating. Our waitress recommended the Vietnamese French press coffee with condensed milk which was extraordinary. She also brought soy sauce to our table to help moisten our edamame which made the dish 10 times better. Overall, she always checked on our table at the right times without being overbearing, although we were the only table in the restaurant.    The Atmosphere: Confused? but comfortable. The DJ in the back decided indie hits to the likes of Passion Pit and Bon Iver were appropriate that day. The decor fit that of a typical Asian restaurant, except for the leg lamp in the window (great reminder of Cleveland's local Tremont claim to fame). Still, it is definitely a great spot for any occasion, from casual lunch to dinner and a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Bac hits every note right with his modern Asian-American bistro.    We came last night on recommendation from two friends, one who is an avid Yelper and Cleveland aficionado.    Party of four.  We were not disappointed!  Since we arrived for an early dinner before a play downtown, we were in time for happy hour. This turned out to be the best experience, because we got to try several small plate items and fill up on a variety of savory bites.  We started with Lychee Mojitos and the Singapore Redux, and then proceeded to order a little bit of everything on the menu: edamame, sweet potato tempura fries, spring rolls, summer rolls, pork rangoon, lemongrass crab cakes, tom yum soup, banh mi sandwich, mango yellow curry, and the banh bao steamed bun.  It was a gorgeous tour of Asian fusion, and we all left eager to return.   Anne was our server and a-mazing!  Bac even made the rounds to greet each table.  I love that touch.  I only wish he would've introduced himself as the owner, so I could've thanked him in person for a perfect meal."}
{"text":"My party and I visited Bac Asian for restaurant week 2015.  We started off with salads (quite sizable & fresh, not packaged), appetizers (chili garlic wings, gyoza dumplings, tom yum soup, & crab cakes--satisfying to each's palate).  Entrees were of generous portions and served piping hot to our table--pad thai, walnut shrimp (xlarge), & mango yellow curry (served as spicy  as you prefer).  The flan for dessert was creamy and flavorful.   The food is consistent whenever I have visited.  In my opinion, Bac offered the best variety from their menu  for restaurant week.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Pan asian fare in Tremont.  The chicken wings were great.  The delicious walnut shrimp were breaded in tempura.  Everything we ordered from the mango curry to the basil fried rice was good.  I think I prefer authentic asian cuisine over asian fusion but this place is still a nice detour from my routine."}
{"text":"Spicy, flavorful food with large portions - perfect for making all your coworkers jealous the next day when you eat it in front of them. Try their sweet potato tempura fries, avocado curry, and kimchi noodles. The noodles are made of potato and I can't even describe how good they are. Try to save room for dessert (it'll be hard) - the spicy brownie is delightfully edgy. Also the restaurant is a lovely shade of green. If that's not enough to get you to go there then I give up."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday with a group of friends.  I got the avocado green curry with tofu and I was beyond impressed!  The curry was at the most perfect spicy level!  I love curry- and have had many kinds- but none like this.  A very pleasant surprise.  The restaurant was clean and didn't have that annoying fried smell many Asian restaurants have.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're reading this review and you're NOT sitting at a table in Bac, you need to get in your car/on your bike/on the bus and get over there in a hurry. Seriously, go ahead, I'll wait.    Holy crap, right?  I went here for dinner tonight with my parents and brother and we were all suitably impressed.  I don't even know where to begin.  First off, this happy hour is good.  And I mean, really, really good.  A very large selection of $5 cocktails and small plates means you can get an absolutely fantastic dinner for not a lot of money.    I'm not ashamed to admit that I've got a pretty significant weakness for $5 cocktails.  Since I wasn't the one behind the wheel this evening, I tried several.  The first was a brand new addition to the menu that I'm blanking on the name (I told you I just had several cocktails) but it was Mekong Something.  Maple smoked bourbon, ginger beer and lime.  It was like a Moscow Mule but with delicious, delicious bourbon.  This drink just made my list of new favorites.  I followed it up with their version of a basil martini made with gin, St. Germain, muddled basil, and lemon.  It tasted like I was drinking perfume, and I mean that in the best way.  It had a really unique floral taste that was intense but addicting.  The last one I had was the Singapore Redux.  Think a Singapore Sling but with spicy chili added.  Each was totally different and incredibly tasty.  My mom and my brother each got the Lychee Mojito and loved it.  I especially liked that it had a lychee fruit floating in it.  My brother also got the Forbidden Fruit, which tasted like a mix between a Pina Colada and bubblegum.  It was a little sweet for my tastes, but I can see where people who have a taste for that would love it.    Since I knew this was our dinner destination I went easy on the food all day so I'd have plenty of room.  Picking from the small plates (only $5 during happy hour), the four of us split an order of the bacon guacamole with fried wontons.  I also got a bowl of miso soup, and we split one of the coconut milk crepes.  I just ate more food than I have all week and I'm already drooling just thinking about these.  They were all delicious and are an absolute steal for that price.    For dinner my mom and I each got a Banh-Mi sandwich with tempura sweet potato fries (also only $5 during happy hour, $8 if you add the sweet potato fries) while my brother got the Pho and my dad got the Vietnamese Noodle Salad.  The portions here are absolutely gigantic, which is both a blessing and a curse considering that you'll want to eat every bite.  Yeah, you can always take home leftovers, but you won't want to wait that long.  The Pho and the Noodle Salad were practically served in buckets, but unlike some places this was quantity AND quality.    Believe it or not, after all that we soldiered through with some dessert.  You can't put Mitchell's Green Tea ice cream (custom made just for Bac) on your menu and not expect me to get it.  That's crazy talk.  I already said \"Mitchell's\" and \"green tea ice cream\" so I shouldn't need to say that it was fantastic, but just in case, it was fantastic.  My mom and my brother loved the fried ice cream they split (never seen it done quite like this) and my dad was impressed with the flan.    I'd heard good word-of-mouth about Bac and people definitely weren't lying.  Even if you don't make it for happy hour the prices are very reasonable, especially considering how much food you get.  Our server also did a great job and was super friendly and helpful when we had questions.  I was really surprised that it wasn't busier when we left.  It was only 6:30, which is still kind of early, but from what I've heard from others it's never all that crowded.  That needs to change because I don't want to see this place going anywhere.    If you haven't been, you should probably bump this up on your list.  I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously great restaurant in Tremont. The service was fantastic, the outdoor patio was lovely and the food was fantastic. The servings were large and extremely reasonably priced. I had the Asian pear mojito (which was fantastic), vegetarian spring rolls and veggie pad thai. All were amazing. Highly recommended! The person I was dining with had a salad that she really enjoyed and the veggie stir-fry, which she adored. Check this place out. It's wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place is great, went here with the fam on one of my last nights in town.  I tried the Kimchi Noodles, Bacon Guac, Walnut Shrimp,& Bahn Mi. It was all delicious. The noise level/ atmosphere was great. It was a little pricey and I was fortunate I didn't have to pay. However, you pay for great service. Seek out this tiny Tremont spot!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Tremont, I can't help but come back. The sweet potato tempura fries are an absolute must. For dinner the orange chicken is quite good as well as the walnut shrimp. Ambience is great and so is the location which features a handy parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"Ok my extreme bias is going to show because this is a family member of mine and I'm so proud of what he's done.  However, if I didn't think the place was up to standard I just would not review it.  Bac is an Asian Fusion restaurant with lots of Vietnamese influence.  Vietnamese food is what I grew up eating and is my comfort food so this place has everything that I need.  The coconut crepe is crispy on the outside and filled with mung bean, pork and mini shrimp on the inside.  Served with that Vietnamese staple, fish sauce, it's delicious.  Same with the green papaya salad with fish sauce, pickled veggies and lime... delicious.  The banh mi contains just enough of those unidentifiable ingredients to make it authentic and is served on a thin, toasted French baguette.  The crab cakes taste mostly of crab and non of that unwanted filler.  The pad thai is sweet and full of flavor.   The drinks are also amazing, each containing some sort of Asian flair like the lychee-tini or my favorite the saigon latte, with a base of the french pressed coffee and condensed milk (which is ridiculously good on it's own) and liquoring it up, delicious. The space is bright and calming and the servers extremely friendly.  Friday was opening night so it's not perfect yet and everyone's getting used to each other but with time it's going to be a Tremont staple and a good place to go for some Vietnamese comfort food.  (Yes they do have pho but I have  not had a chance to try it yet, but I can tell you  at family functions it's always delicious)"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it real here and let you know that my first impressions of Bac were really terrible. I had ordered some takeout the first week they were open, and I think they hadn't found their groove yet because my food lacked flavor and inspiration. It took a long time for me to get just 2 dishes and the service wasn't so friendly. I was bummed to say the least, as they are a mile away from me and had sweet happy hour specials.  BUT THEN  I tried Bac again after having a taste of some of my coworker's leftover papaya salad. (Which was splendid, btw.)  THANK GOODNESS I DID!  My impressions of Bac have completely changed. I think about eating their Tom Yum soup + Vegetarian Bahn Mi at least once per day. Their Bahn Mi is clearly the best in town and the tofu is superbly marinated and cooked.   The bartenders and waitstaff are super friendly and charming. Bac himself has been there cooking every time I visit, and he almost always comes out to check on how you're doing. Nice touch, man!  The happy hour specials are tight, the ambiance is laid back yet modern and stylish, and the music is always right up my ally. Its a great place to grab a quick yet delicious meal alone at the bar or take a date for a chill dinner in the chic dining room.   I consider myself a Cleveland-area Thai food connoisseur, and this place totally gets a two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  *Finally* - someone has brought proper Asian food to Cleveland (besides Ty Fun).  This place was sorely needed and I have already been telling everyone I know in Cleveland to hit this place up.  Everything we ordered was aces - gyoza and satay were damn solid and the spring rolls were some of the best I've ever had (and I must qualify that I lived in Chinatown in NYC, as well as in San Francisco, so I've had the best!).  I got the Pho, and it was pretty phenomenal.  Broth was really good, not sure if it was the best ever, but very, very good.  Raw beef on top, fresh sprouts and mint on a plate, which is standard, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a place in NE Ohio do it correctly like this.  Massive portion, too.  I'd like to shake the hand of whoever opened this place.  Great job getting it right in a city where there's not really a demand for real Vietnamese, Thai or any other Asian cuisines.  I want this place here on my block in Chicago."}
{"text":"Loved the food but not so crazy about the owner's bullying of a fellow Yelper following a bad review. Not sure if I'll be back....  I loved the pho and my boyfriend was crazy about the kimchi dish. The food packs a hell of a flavor punch. And the outdoor seating is perfect for a summer date night."}
{"text":"I finally came here for lunch and it's a great meal!  They have bento boxes, called \"Bento Bac\" that lets you get three or four small portions of multiple things for $9 or $12.  It's pretty much an awesome way to get a tasting menu for lunch.  I had some Tom Yum soup, green papaya salad, chicken satay, and 1/2 banh mi sandwich.  It was perfect!  My wife got the lunch portion of Pho and my buddy got the lunch portion of Kimchi Noodles (each $9).  The portions were actually quite big and we still needed boxes.  Service was good as usual."}
{"text":"Lunch menu reasonably priced. The food was good but not spectacular. The waitress very friendly, but a little slow considering we are the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add that the Pho Soup is AMAZING at Bac.  It is enough for at least 2 people to share (and they will serve it in two bowls if you ask).  Additionally one of my other favorite dinner meals is the Pork Chop and Egg.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The Asian food is made fresh and it had pure taste. The selection is very big and the drinks are tasteful. It's a chill atmosphere and it's perfect for a date. I recommend the Pho!!"}
{"text":"So. Asian Fusion. What exactly is it that these Asians are fused to, anyway?  In the case of Bac, the fusion appeared to be bacon and avocado the night that we were there. And that fusion worked very well.  We arrived on a Saturday evening on short notice and were treated to outdoor seating in a cozy sidewalk dining area. (Alas, like much of the outdoor seating in Cleveland, the experience encompasses neither garden-like privacy nor the charm of interesting folk strolling by. All we got was a Humvee limousine with a woo girl leaning out the window. But Cleveland restaurants get points for trying.) The drinks menu looked interesting, but I was craving a glass of plum wine. When asked, the waitress informed us that it was so unpopular that they owners had taken it off the menu, but then she went to the wine cellar and ferreted out a bottle for me, an effort that pleased me greatly.  My husband and I started with the bacon guacamole with fried won-tons, an appetizer that we both found delicious. The won-tons were wonderfully crisp and the guacamole fresh and flavorful. For the main course I had the green curry with avocado, which was one of the best curries I've ever eaten. Avocado seemed a bit risky in curry, but it complimented the creaminess of the curry very well. I usually have leftover curry when I eat out, but it was so delicious I simply couldn't stop eating it.  The one disappointment was my husband's noodle salad. He ordered it with chicken and the chopped egg roll. The chicken was left out, and while the waitress was quick to bring a side of grilled chicken to add to it, the noodles were bland and the flavors didn't blend.    The failure of one dish does not condemn a restaurant, and we will definitely be back.  The prices were also very reasonable for the quality of the food.We enjoyed the experience and found most of the food delicious. Definitely a dining experience worth enjoying."}
{"text":"Bac exceeded my expectations from the decor to the food to the service.  I went over thanksgiving with my family and friends (10 total people), and the food came out at a good pace such that we were always munching and never waiting for our food.  We enjoyed the papaya salad (limey and amazing!),. tom yum soup (spicily and limey great with shrimp in it), kimchi noodles (deliciously hot), pad thai (great classic done just right), vietnamese sandwich (so good my mom said she wants only this next time), and mango curry shrimp (WOW!  how is the mango so good at this time of year????  shrimp cooked just right too).  I'm already torn on what I'll get next time as everything was so great!  Decor was awesome, place had a great hum so that it was busy but not so loud that you couldn't hear the conversation on other side of table.  Cute ambiance with fantastic food all around - absolutely nothing to complain about here...chef even came out to say hello!"}
{"text":"Please not, 3 stars are only for the amazing tuna they have. Everything else was blah. Cocktails were a watered down mush, my Vietnamese noodle salad was missing vegetables that were promised, service was inconsistent and slow. I mean we were a birthday party of 12, but hello, customers are not shoes. Sometimes they come not only in pairs. Also bringing out  small plates for the cake before the birthday cake totally kills the element of surprise. Especially when plates sit there for a while and cake is still not arriving. So yeh, go there strictly with one more person. And have some tuna with water. Be like Buddha."}
{"text":"Great drinks and wonderful Thai food. The most authentic I have had outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Even though my egg roll was over salted, my noodle salad bowl had more salad than noodle, and I sent my first bowl back to the kitchen because I am pretty sure I found a strand of hair mixed in the salad, I would still come back because ironically pricey hipster Vietnamese food in Cleveland tastes better than hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurants and that's just one way Bc turns the rules in its favor.   I get the sense that good food in general is respected here along with a tasteful bar offering, decent music, and ESPN Sportscenter.   Rather than boring my taste buds with the usual Bc challenges my senses by introducing it's own take on traditional spices and dishes. Meanwhile offering a high caliber dining experience for hipsters, families and travelers, like me. From the outside Bc appears to be a wildcard fusion Vietnamese-American restaurant but Bc lives up to its hype and delivers on an intelligent marriage between home-grown Vietnamese and savvy American dining."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I've been there twice.  Once for a birthday dinner and another time for happy hour.    First, I will say their cocktails were all quite delicious.  I recommend the Singapore redux for a little spice kick at the end of each sip. I've tried the Forbidden fruit, Lychee mojito, and St. Basil the Great.   All good and not too sweet!  For the food, sadly I wasn't impressed.  At the dinner, I tried the grilled pork-chop and egg.  Maybe since I know what Vietnamese food should taste like, it didn't meet my expectations but I was left underwhelmed.  I'll admit the happy hour has some good deals.  But again, nothing we got really stood out.  We tried the bacon guac, chili garlic wings, banh mi, and maybe some others I can't remember.  Bacon guac was meh, if you want really good guac go to Momocho.  The wings were tasty, but nothing outstanding.  And the banh mi was alright.  I didn't really like the bread it came with but it's at least better than banh mi at other places in Cleveland (I wouldn't get it again though).  Bumped up to 3 stars because the cocktails are really good and it's a nice place, but I'm not a big fan of the food."}
{"text":"After eating lots of meat and starch over Christmas week, my girlfriend and I decided that fresh and relatively healthy Asian fare would be a welcome change.  We opted to try Bac on the evening of Monday, December 29.    Upon arrival shortly after 5:30, we were welcomed to an empty host stand with papers and pamphlets littering the table behind it.  We were greeted by the bartender before the hostess emerged from the kitchen several minutes later.  Why a hostess *ever* needs to go into the kitchen is beyond me.    We were seated in the dining room and given glasses of water.  After waiting 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence--let alone take a drink order--we left without so much as a verbal comment from any of the staff.  The lack of any sense of urgency was appalling to say the least.  I wouldn't want any of the Bac staff working for me, that's for certain.    I think the owner need not worry about opening new restaurants if his staff is going to torpedo his business with such horrifically shitty non-service.  I have no motivation whatsoever to return to Bac or to even try Ninja City.  I know plenty of Vietnamese and Thai restaurants in Cleveland that do value my business.  I will continue to patronize them, and steer my friends and acquaintances toward them and away from this insult to dining."}
{"text":"The guacamole with bacon and wonton chips for dipping was great and a nice surprise to see on the menu. Their crab cakes were awesome as well. Had those on my first trip here, as well as the Orange Chicken which was good but not what I was hoping for. Either way, I really liked this place as a casual, quiet date spot and will definitely go BAC soon!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this restaurant. I've NEVER had a bad meal or a bad time. The staff, atmosphere and food are ALL phenomenal. The chef even comes out and personally asks how your meal is. If you haven't visited you need to!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Bac started off pretty great.  Got an awesome seat on the patio, very friendly helpful waitress with great recommendations on drinks.  The sangria was a little sweet but delicious overall. We were there for happy hour, so all the small plates are 5 bucks!  We got two appetizers to get a little taste of what they have to offer.  The crab rangoons were absolutely amazing.  I'd go back just for those.  Obviously homemade with a delicious, creamy filling and a rather spicy red chili sauce for dipping.  Not greasy at all and perfectly crispy.  Our second appetizer were the steamed buns with pork.  Again, I thought these were great.  My dining partner was not as big of a fan, but had never had a steamed bun before.  I thought the buns were delicious, soft, tender, and the pork was really nicely seasoned.  This is where the deliciousness pretty much stopped, and unfortunately the food went downhill from here.  I had Classic Bahn Mi sandwich which is a French baguette with dill radish, carrot, jalape√±o, cilantro, house aioli. The \"classic\" sandwich includes thinly slice roast pork, Vietnamese sausage, ham and pate.  Perhaps this may have been a little too exotic for my personal palate.  It smelled funny and tasted even worse.  Again, might have just been me, but I just wasn't a fan.  The bread on the sandwich was delightful however, and I pretty much went to town on that.  My dining partner had the orange chicken, which was mediocre.  Overall, I'd go back and probably make a meal out of appetizers  and leave much happier."}
{"text":"We tried Bac's because the menu looked good. We were there for lunch and got the Bento box. Had the fried spring rolls, fried pork rangoons, papaya salad and all of it was amazing and delicious! Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Well, I've never set foot in Cleveland but I know Bac's food, and I would feed it to Shungho every day if I could, it's that good. I would say something that could be taken the wrong way, so I won't say anything other than I look forward to stopping by again the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome Asian Fusion!  Headed here with the lovely Miss Cara L while I was in town helping with a Yelp party and I'm soooo happy we made a priority to get here.  There were way more menu items than I anticipated, which ultimately was a good thing, but at the time was bad because it took me what seemed like hours to make a decision! After bugging our server with dozens of questions - who notably was visibly annoyed even though we were two of maybe six people total in the restaurant... the only thing I didn't like about this place  - I finally decided I HAD to have the papaya salad and the scallops, which were on the seasonal menu.  People - this food is no joke! Tons of complex flavors, fresh ingredients, inspiring combinations. Wowza! Why wasn't this place open when I lived in Cleveland!?! Wah!  The papaya salad was crisp, lightly dressed and made the PERFECT starter for my scallops - but really for anything on that menu. Really! I ate every bite.  The scallops were plump and perfectly seared and the bed of sweet mashed potatoes made the perfect side dish.   I inhaled my food in an unheard of record time and lucky for me my dinner parter did not judge, and in fact, also inhaled hers just as quickly! A little more gracefully though perhaps.  Dessert was the real treat, literally - fried ice cream... AKA ICE CREAM IN A DONUT! Holy hell! Now we've hit new heights of mouthgasm. I was entirely too full to pull any other substance in my body but I could not stop moving spoonfuls full of this perfect dessert from the plate to my mouth.  Besides our awkward and kinda jerk of a server, and the fact that their ladies restroom wasn't functioning so I had to pee in a toilet next to a urinal in the men's room, this place is top notch! The food, the food, the food!"}
{"text":"Start to finish a great meal.  Can't miss coconut milk crepe or pork belly. Bahn mi sando not my favorite but not bad.  One miss out of 2 apps and 4 entrees good in my book.  Servers were quick and friendly.    Dining room does get loud at peak time."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  Has somewhat of a trendy vibe, lots of vegetarian and gluten-free selections.  The food was pretty good (had a big bowl of pho, which was delicious).  The portions were substantial.  The service was good.  The bathrooms were not so good, sadly, that marred the experience a bit."}
{"text":"Why at you leaving us.  Such great food over the years.  Vietnamese noodle salad....Yes Please!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've kinda been a Pho kick lately. Those that know me, know that at times, I tend to get obsessed with things. I overwhelm myself with said item until I burn myself out. I'm an \"all-in\" or nothing at all guy. A few years ago it was Greek Pizza. A year before that, it was White Russians. I like variety to a certain extent. But I love having something to obsess over at all times.  Ok, so where were we? Right, Pho. After recently being disappointed by a bowl of Pho and B√°nh m√¨ that I've had elsewhere, I needed redemption. So naturally, we went to Bac. The outside of Bac was done-up with super cute inflatable Christmas decorations. Holiday cheer was in the air.   Now to the point... I ordered the B√°nh m√¨ to split with the missus and a bowl of Pho all for myself. The b√°nh m√¨ was impressive as always. And during happy hour, it's only $5! I shudder to fathom this when comparing it to the Vietnamese sandwiches that can be had elsewhere in the city. Value and quality wise, it's the best b√°nh m√¨ that Cleveland has to offer.   The Pho was excellently done too. A mountain of razor thin slices of rare beef adorn the top of the bowl like a glowing angel perched on the top of a Christmas tree. Bells rung, angels got their wings, George Bailey appreciated life. When I dug into this bow of Pho, all was right in the world.   The quality of ingredients in this bowl of steamy goodness was certainly superior to competing bowls in the area. Perhaps some would argue that the Pho at Bac is a modern take on an ancient classic. But I found it to be the work of a craftsman--someone who clearly has an eye of an artist, but the soul of a chef remains intact.  I found the broth to be perfectly spiced (not heat wise, but of cinnamon, cardamon and coriander.) In other words, the flavors of the season. With the leaves of trees now missing and the crisp temperatures of the night air, it was exactly what I was after. It also happened to pair perfectly with a Christmas brew. Rogue's Santa's Private Reserve to be exact.  Following our meal, just the same as our previous visits, the owner checked on everyone's table to make sure all was well. A well run establishment like this that continues to deliver consistently executed plates deserves respect. There's not a lot of them around, but this is one of them."}
{"text":"The food was pretty average to go along with small portions, but the wait staff is really nice and they also are nice to their neighbors. They work out an arrangement with the Cleveland brew shop for tastings, and they have the occasional party at night which are a ton of fun. Now if only I could remember when they have them!"}
{"text":"Happy hour at Bac from 3-6pm weekdays is one of the best deals in Cleveland: $5 cocktails, $5 small plates (which are actually pretty decently sized), $5 banh mi, and $1 tall boys. For anyone keeping track of such things, that's over half the menu on offer for $5 or less.  Bac's cocktails are always tasty, if a bit stingy on the liquor. The lychee mojito is always a good choice, but I spent my most recent visit embracing nostalgia for the summers I spent in Britain during university and quaffing $5 Pimm's No. 1 cups.   I've liked pretty much everything I've tried on the menu, but the crab cakes, spicy shrimp quesadillas, and pork banh mi are standouts from the happy hour menu. If you're looking for a full-size entree, I'm a big fan of the wok seared steak tips--the combo of tangy lemongrass and seared beef is divine.  Service is prompt and friendly, at the bar or a table.  Dinner is great too, but when you can get the same food for ~half the price during happy hour, why wouldn't you?"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. I came here for dinner on my birthday and everyone in my family was able to find something they loved--a rarity! The portions are extremely generous and everything is flavored beautifully. I got a noodle bowl that was piping hot but the vegetables sprinkled on top were fresh, crisp, and tasted like they had come straight out of a garden. We also got the green papaya salad to split as an appetizer among the 5 of us.  It may sound strange, but it is amazing and I can't recommend it enough. Seriously. Get it!   I was there with a family member who has very specific dietary needs and our waitress was wonderful in listening to what my family member needed, was able to answer almost all of her questions, and was also confident enough to let us know when she didn't know something. Once that happened, she went back to the kitchen and got her answer--and was able to provide additional food offerings to my cousin and suggest ways the chef could change up the meal. Fabulous!  In addition to the friendly wait staff who took the time to answer our questions and get the meal right for us, Bac himself came out to visit and check on us. I really appreciate when a chef has that kind of commitment to his food and his customers.   I simply cannot recommend Bac enough and have been singing its praises to my friends and acquaintances ever since we went. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Share small plates to try various things! The large plates just seem to big and don't allow you to try some of the other good stuff on the menu.   Tried the Chicken Satays, papaya salad, spring rolls and their shrimp. ALL delicious.   I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and it was fantastic!  I ordered the spicy kimchi noodles and they were f**king delicious.   It was the best dish I've ever had here.  For our previous visits, the food was always solid and I would have given a 4 star review.  These delicious noodles deserve 5.  Normally we get the steamed buns as well which are always very good, but we decided to skip them and go straight to the entrees.  Good choice, as I ate every incredible bite.  Bac also has a good beer list to go with a good sake list.  We have been here in the past when the service wasn't too good, but our server yesterday was great."}
{"text":"Kim Chi was outstanding!  Watch out though.  The portions are huge.  You will leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"Bac! All is forgiven! I love you! Pork buns are now a lunch option, but perhaps even better than that, the lunch bento boxes are amazing. Pick three items for $10 or four items for $12; I love the gyoza (so crispy), the spicy shrimp quesadilla (that mango salsa, tho), & the green papaya salad (very fresh). Even better? They now deliver  & offer pickup via Skip the Dishes, so I'm basically never having lunch anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went to this location at the recommendation of a friend, who believes this place has the best pho in Ohio. Bac is a fusion restaurant, and serves a wide variety of different Asian dishes, but apparently the pho is the best thing there.  The pho comes with the standard assortment of noodles, broth, lime, bean sprouts, Sriracha sauce, and Hoisin sauce. It also comes with both cooked and raw beef, though the broth comes at such a high temperature that you can let the beef cook in the broth and decide how rare you want the beef to be. The broth itself is pretty good, and the meat is nice and tender. The noodles are standard for the course as far as pho goes. I can't say I am a pho connoisseur, as I have not been to many pho places in the United States, but Bac is definitely solid as far as the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Great food, service and environment. I tried quite a few plates and enjoyed all of them. If only I had space for dessert I would have asked for the fried ice cream! I guess that'll have to happen the next time I stop in.  Oh yeah, and the food is perfectly priced!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing asian fusion food and great affordable cocktails. Great with a group of friends or for date night!"}
{"text":"I spent some time waffling between giving this restaurant 3 or 4 stars, but I had to go with 3 based on the poor service.  I stopped by Bac on a Friday night without reservations.  The frantic hostess had a really hard time figuring out where to seat us and placed my party at a high top table in the completely empty bar area.  (You don't want to go in the dining room!  It's crazy in there!)  My boyfriend and I ordered drinks and an appetizer while our friend went to meet up with his wife and bring her back to the restaurant.  It took an eternity for our waitress to take our orders, and even longer for our drinks to appear.  (the vegetarian spring rolls didn't arrive until well after our friend and his wife returned...and that was at least a half hour later)    By the time our appetizer arrived, we needed a refill on drinks and the two new people at the table also needed drinks.  We all placed our order and our food order and patiently waited for something - anything - to arrive at our table.  The beers showed up fairly quickly but my mixed drink - some sort of watermelon concoction that was on special - took at least an additional 10 minutes.    So then we waited some more.  Thank goodness the food was amazing when it finally showed up, because we were starving...and I was starting to lose my patience.  I ordered another drink - which arrived after I finished my meal.  (I'm a fast eater, but still...)  My boyfriend had the traditional stir fry, which he liked a lot.  Our friend ordered one kind of stir fry, but ended up with something different - a mango stir fry.  Thank goodness he liked mangoes and isn't the type to freak out, because who knows how long it would have taken to get a replacement meal.  I had the pesto rice noodle dish with tofu.  It was pretty amazing.  (what was also amazing is the number of vegetarian options on the menu - SCORE!)  We'd talked about getting dessert but just couldn't stand to wait any longer, so we left and went down the street to get drinks...in a more timely fashion.    I hope that we just happened to drop by on an off night.  With such amazing food, I'd hate for other people to get turned off by the sub par service."}
{"text":"I always look forward to dinners here. Such an expansive menu, so it's a good spot for pretty much anyone.  Dishes that have a \"spicy\" marker next to it are indeed spicy...so beware! From what I remember they have a nice happy hour menu.  Patio isn't that great, considering it's next to a busy road. But it's still a nice option considering the area that it's in. Make sure you have reservations for the weekends, as this place is on the small side and usually fills up fast."}
{"text":"Okay, I have an confession to make.  Before Bac, I used to equate \"Asian Fusion\" with \"Asian Expensive.\"  But Bac has since changed my ways.    This is successful Asian Fusion - Asian dishes with an American twist.  Examples: - The Banh Bao Buns are cooked perfectly and reminiscent of delicious pork buns that I've had in Chinese restaurants of Los Angeles, but with two delectable additions of  a hard-boiled egg and shitake mushrooms in the filling. - The Vietnamese Noodle Salad is an excellent Vietnamese noodle dish, but blended with a traditional American salad.  I'm not a salad person but really it's more of a noodle dish than a salad dish, and the dressing was sweet, tangy and delicious.  Get it with shrimp and the chopped spring roll - you won't regret it! - The Pork with Egg is just like a Chinese pork bian dang (bento lunch box), but with American veggies and dressing.  The pork was cooked correctly and blended well with the egg.  The portions are HUGE and it was surprisingly inexpensive (about $50 for two appetizers, two entrees that each could be split into two meals and spring rolls to go).  The decor in the main dining area is hip and very fun, but the entire area is for people with reservations - make a reservation or you will be eating at the bar or one of three small tables by the bar."}
{"text":"yummmm I miss this place!  I had a really interesting curry with mango, and I highly recommend it! My mom had a spicy dish and she loved it. The patio is perfect for a day with nice weather, especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good food, and a GREAT happy hour. The regular prices are a little steep for what you get, but the stir-fried pork banh mi is great, as are the majority of the appetizers. The curry is good not great, and the noodle salad is delicious."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at this restaurant has been amazing.  Their happy hour is probably one of the most generous in the city. $5.00 small plates (in my opinion they're perfectly sized) and drinks that taste amazing (priced from $5.00-7.00).  I also love their business hours since other restaurants in the area don't open for dinner until after 4:30-5:00 PM.  A girls gotta drink when a girls gotta drink. Cheers!"}
{"text":"For Christmas, we gave our 13 year-old son 12 coupons. Each coupon is good for one meal out at a new (to us) restaurant, of his choosing. Last night he picked Bac for his January meal. It was AWESOME!   Drink menu is diverse and fun. My husb had a tasty beer, and I had the Tokyo-tini. It was a bit on the strong side. That is not a complaint :)  Kids and husband started with the gyoza dumplings- pork, cabbage, ginger soy dunking sauce. They loved!   For our entrees, we did a lot of sharing! I had the Vietnamese cabbage noodle salad and it was divine. Very fresh, lots of flavors popping in my mouth. Perfection. My husband ordered the basil fried rice. Two minutes in, we swapped plates and both agreed that both were totally delicious. If I had to pick between the two, say it was a life or death situation. What would cause someone's life to be on the line as it relates to an entree decision? Nobody knows. This is just for fun so go with it :)  If I had to pick, I'd choose the basil fried rice-- tons of fresh veggies and again, fireworks in my mouth.   My 8 year old chose the wok seared steak tips (he has rich tastes!) and my 13 year old had the crispy orange chicken. His only complaint was that there were too many sesame seeds. I don't know how it's possible that he's my kid, because THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MANY SESAME SEEDS!   The service was great- always there when we needed a refill or plate removed. Very friendly. We will most certainly be back! Maybe we'll try their weekday happy hour! It looks great."}
{"text":"from the handful of times ive been here, always enjoyed coming to this spot. as of now, the best bowl of pho ive had in my life and stateside, ive had my fair share. so if youre a fan of pho, definitely come here. its definitely worth it. the only bowl of pho i wont put any sauce in. he does it right. the service was always great when i went. yeah. that pho man. so good.   their other items are pretty standard for vietnamese fare in my opinion. good and solid. overall, this place is great and is a must try!"}
{"text":"My brother, his girlfriend, another friend, and I were trying to figure out where to go to dinner on Monday night.  Since I started yelping recently , my friend immediately began searching on yelp and found Bac.  None of us had been there before, it had great reviews, and it was close by, so we decided to head here for dinner.    I had dined in the previous establishment and was curious to see how to space had been converted.  I feel like one of the drawbacks is the space.  It is sectioned off into two rooms, which makes for an awkward setup when you walk in.  There is a bar and high top tables in the first room, and you can see in the back, which looks a little strange.  We were greeted by a semi-friendly hostess, who sat us right away in the second room.  The restaurant doesn't offer great ambiance.  It decorated in a modern Asian style, but the tables and space itself seem very sterile.  I was a little bit off-put by it but didn't let it dictate my opinion of the food.  The hostess brought over water right away, but we sat there for about ten minutes before our server appeared.  We ordered some cocktails.  My brother got the Mekong Rest Stop, and I got the 17th Parallel.  Both were delicious.  Later on, I ordered a Primm's Cup #1, which was on the specials menu, and it was also was very good.  So far, so good.  Our food came out pretty quickly.  We started off with a edamame and a papaya salad.  The edamame was pretty standard, and my brother and I thought the salad was great, but the other two could take it or leave it.  The noodle dishes were HUGE, like three servings worth.!  I tried my friend's kim chi noodles with tofu, which were very tasty--the perfect amount of heat.  I got the avocado green curry with shrimp at the recommendation of other Yelpers and our server.  I ordered it at a level 4, which was the right amount of heat for me.  It was fantastic!  My brother ordered the Pho, and his girlfriend ordered the tofu banh mi, and they both said their food was great.  Overall, I really enjoyed the cocktails and the food.  The service was that great, and the space itself needs a little work."}
{"text":"WOW, Asian Fusion doesn't do this place justice.  This place has some AMAZING Pad Thai that I thought was only available at \"legit\" thai restaurants!  I have been looking for good Thai nearby and haven't found much, but this place is right in the heart of Tremont and just a short drive away.   I took my meal to go, so I can't comment on the service, but the food is definitely 5 stars!  Can't wait to go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"Asian fusion seems like a bit of a cliche by now, but when you do it as creatively as Bac, it's not cliched at all. In fact, we really enjoyed our dinner here, which I think probably covered their menu pretty well. We started with a very clever \"autumn roll\" that fused Vietnamese technique with classic Thanksgiving flavors. To be honest, it sounded so awful, we tried it as a silent dare to the kitchen... but they pulled it off, and it was delicious. For entrees, we had a green curry that would be at home in any Thai restaurant (except for the fascinating and effective avocado), and a short rib hot pot that blended Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese flavors but presented almost like an American pot roast. If I wanted a specific Asian cuisine, I probably would not come here, but I'll be back to enjoy the good  and pretty reasonably priced food, and to see more creativity from the kitchen."}
{"text":"We went here as a large party for a celebration dinner.  The owner, Bac, had heard that I had eaten there before and personally came to our table to thank us for our patronage, and to chat with us.  We ordered the family meal with consists of 2 enormous platters of entree of your choosing (we chose the pad Thai and mango curry), tom yum soup, papaya salad, spring rolls, and banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich).  Yes, a LOT of food, and a LOT of delicious food to boot!  The banh mi is probably one of the best I've ever had, perfect portions of meat and veggie to bread, and very flavorful.  I had also ordered one of the cocktails, the Saigon latte, and it was smooth, strong, and delicious.  I tried some of the tropical julius too, which was equally as good.  I was very impressed this time around with the food, service, pretty much everything.  Very highly recommended and as a result I am bumping this review up to 5 stars.  Come out here and try some dishes, and support a great owner who serves really excellent food."}
{"text":"The service at this place is terrible. I'm easy to please. I don't do fine dining, so my expectations are quite low. It's a slow Tuesday night with only 7 tables outside to serve. I waited several minutes to be seated and was then given menus to seat myself outside. No joke, I then waited 7 minutes for a server to acknowledge my presence and that was after a snotty \"not my waitress\" told me my server would be right out. I immediately ordered a beer, an app and my meal. Another 10 minutes later (if you're counting, that's 17 minutes after being seated), I get my appetizer...still no beer. I would rather have NO food for an hour than no beer for 20 minutes.   Pork Rangoon is very good by the way...as is the Founder's Red Rye Pale Ale.   Would give it another shot because I'm a nice guy... And, being from Chicago, I like outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly staff. Limited but satisfying menu. The staff accommodated our 13 person party on a Saturday night with little notice. The server was patient with us, friendly, and fast.   Bac also has a good selection of beverages! Nice low key atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my fianc√© HATES \"Asian fusion\". But this place proved him wrong.  Summer rolls: eh, get the spring rolls  Papaya salad: best we have ever had. Does not need any meat to be fantastic  Basil fried rice: awesome  Pork chop and egg: amazing, everything perfectly cooked, tender, a d flavorful  Will be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome dining experience. The steam buns are fantastic, the banh mi is delicious and the red curry soup is to die for. This is only a sampling of their great menu items. To go along with the food, the service and cleanliness stack up with any restaurant in the area. Definitely give Bac a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I ever had,  great staff,  5 STARS all around !  Thanks for the best meal"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed to be quite honest. Was expecting to be mind blown and all I got out of it was ehh."}
{"text":"Good food, kinda cool place.  I probably would have given them 5 stars, but the bartender was a little unresponsive.  Otherwise, great time."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a list of ten restaurants each that we wanted to try in the Cleveland area in 2013, and I am proud to say that I can claim Bac as one of my picks.   We went for lunch on a beautiful and sunny day, so we were happy to eat outdoors (even though the sun was killer and we were without an umbrella). I didn't see the inside of the restaurant, but my husband said it was nice and the bathrooms were just okay.  The food, however, was spectacular, and this is not an adjective I throw around lightly. Bac started serving lunch in January of this year, and the options were fantastic. My husband started with the Gyoza dumplings and had the Pad Thai as his main course. I went with the pick-four Bento because I couldn't decide and wanted to try a few items. I am vegan (sometimes vegetarian if I have to) and there was a lot for me on the menu - I ended up choosing the Green Papaya Salad (so delicious and full of flavor), the Sweet Potato Tempura Fries with a chili ketchup sauce (crispy on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside), the tofu Bahn Mi (great bread, great tofu, great sauce, perfect amount of heat for me) and the veggie spring roll (here was my only disappointment...they brought me a summer roll instead and I let our waiter know that I had wanted a spring roll but didn't want to waste. In the end, it was the healthier option, and I am okay with it. I am still not a huge fan of these though.) The portions were perfect and we felt like the meal was a great value. We stuck with iced green tea for lunch, but definitely want to try cocktails next time.   The staff was friendly although the service was a little slow. If you're on a lunch break, you might really be pushed for time. We were there well over an hour.   I dare say this may be my new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I dare say I just left the restaurant two hours ago, and I already want to go back for dinner. Well played, Bac. Well played."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice. We all liked her. Their beer selection was quite good as well. That out of the way, I think the best way to describe our food would be, \"Asian food for Americans that don't like Asian food\".  Now, I say \"asian\" food because with the exception of the pho one of us had the food is, as the sign on the front says, \"asian american\". What that meant for us was salty, heavy, creamy food that was just... meh. My avocado green curry tasted like someone dropped an extra heaping serving of starch in it... making it almost jelly like in consistency. Half of our party were unable to finish their dishes as they were a gummy, salty mess.  If you are looking for vietnamese food, try any of the real vietnamese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"This is fancy Asian food. Higher price tag for something a little different. I've seen it done better in other cities, but this is one of the best in Cleveland. The pho is good. Pork belly is decent. Definitely not the most memorable meal I've had."}
{"text":"Simply awesome.  The spring rolls were hot and we got them vegetarian, without extra wait.  The mango yellow curry was one of the best things that I have ever eaten.  My partner liked the Basil Fried Rice, but thought it needed a little sauce.  After dinner, Bac came out to ask us how we enjoyed the food.  When I eat out, this is exactly what I want.  Delicious food, great service and a full belly.  I will go here again, and often.   Too bad for the other Asian restaurants we used to visit."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Bac! I only wish their happy hour was longer.  Don't get: lychee martini. I love lychee and this drink is awful.  Otherwise drinks are pretty good.... Singapore redux being my favorite.  The shrimp quesadilla is awesome, as is the crispy walnut shrimp.   They have a small patio which is nice during the summer. Service is always been good!"}
{"text":"First timer here, The service was excellent and the pho was 10/10 and vastly superior to the competition in the area. The Bahn Mi sandwich was filled with flavor and big enough to eat as a meal alone. The shrimp quesadillas were a new experience for me and a very delicious adventure for my mouth to embark on. The waiter Tony was enough for me to come back, The man was very suggestive and helpful on the menu items and was running around the place with some pep in his step. Great Monday night crew BAC."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Asian I've ever had! Definitely would recommend! Staff knowledgeable and friendly. Found my new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"We came last weekend after reading great reviews online. We were very disappointed with everything. All of the dishes we ordered were tasteless. Their version of Orange chicken was to have bunch of fried chicken laying in a pool of vinegar. It was barely edible. No way I will be going back there again. One star for friendly staff."}
{"text":"We had the Vietnamese Noodle salad which was topped with a fried pork spring roll and a Ban Mi sandwich.  Also had the summer roll with dipping sauce.  All were very good and not unlike what you would get at a nice Vietnamese restaurant.  Nice casual atmosphere and the waitress was very pleasant and attentive.  Like the alternative music playing overhead...a plus."}
{"text":"The Pho with raw meat on top is really good . They put fair amount of meat on top with brisket under it . Define tilt good quality. I ordered red curry noodle soup. It was underwhelming but not horrible. Lack of spice even tho I get 5/5 spice level l they put pea pit in the soup is barely cooked and the soup was pretty Greasy. But the appraiser summer roll wasn't bad. I enjoyed their chrysanthemum tea . Which you don't see at many other places. But the Vietnamese iced coffee was not sweet enough. The service was okay . They get really busy so I sat at the bar . So want expecting much, they asked me if I had a reservation ? This is not a restaurant I would put effort to make reservation to . I would give them a 3.5 star if there is an option ."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I will come back as it is right now the street from my best friends casa.  She recommended we go here.  The gyoza is tremendous.  I got the chicken stir fry with garlic sauce...very good.  Will keep this on the list to return!"}
{"text":"I took some clients here recently and they loved it!  Awesome food, nice eclectic menu.  Great staff"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for me anytime I'm back visiting from Chicago!  The Sweet Potato Tempura Fries paired with that chili ketchup is a personal favorite and I just love how they pan fry the Gyoza Dumplings!  The couple cocktails I have had on previous visits were delicious as well, though the names of them currently allude me."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful! Each bite and sip was incredibly delicious. I had the Mekong Rest Stop to drink. Smoked bourbon. Wow. We split the steamed pork buns and spicy shrimp quesadillas to start. It was hard to choose, but we chose well. I had a special. Sesame shrimp. YUM. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked. My partner got the avocado green curry with tofu. It was a bit spicy than he wanted, but he couldn't stop eating it."}
{"text":"I had a great meal in the lo mein. My portion was huge. I think I ate it 2 more times. My husband ordered the honey walnut shrimp and really didn't like it"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants of all time! I Love recommend Bac to new people with confidence.   The food, atmosphere, service, menu, and experience are always top notch and very consistently so.   The menu is loaded with 5 star options and the selection is just right. There is something for whatever you might be feeling like. The menu is not overwhelming. Also they have a great happy hour menu and seasonal specials. All the food is fresh, delicious, and prepared by the chef himself and his family.   The pricing is wonderful... entrees range from 8-18$, most being around 14$. This is amazing considering the high end feel the whole experience has.   The signature cocktails are all delicious.. my favorite is the Singapor redux. Outstanding! And they pour very healthy.   The bartender Chris is very friendly and funny, makes a good drink. All the servers are beautiful, friendly and helpful. Very pleasant staff in general. The owner Bac is very friendly to guests and often personally greats guests when he has time. This is always a very nice touch.   One of my favorite choices to come with a group, on a date, or alone to grab a bit on my way home from working late.   Some of my favorite dishes include the Bahn Mi Sandwich, The Green Avocado Curry with Chicken, and the Pho beef soup.   A++++++++++ in every way."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato tempura fries R soooo good~~~~~ Happy Hour is a must here"}
{"text":"Bac is a gem. Had to grab a fast lunch on a weekday. Set my computer up and enjoyed wifi with very good Miso soup and even better Vietnamese Noodle Salad. Service was top notch. Great lunch specials also. Another Cleveland foodie spot."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  We went with some friends to Bac last night as this place has been on my bookmarks list for a couple years.  We made reservations and were promptly seated.  Our server was friendly, attentive, and she made just the right number of checkups on us.  As appetizers, we ordered bacon guacamole with veggies and summer rolls.  The summer rolls were sticky, fresh, and absolutely delicious.  I could've eaten four of these for dinner!  There's a thought for next time!  The peanut sauce for the rolls was also delicious.  Loved it! The guac was just okay.  Since I am not a huge pho fan, I ordered the red curry with chicken.  It ended up being very similar to pho, but with a thicker, more flavorful curry sauce with a bit of spice.  I loved the flavor, but again, not a fan of a big bowl of soup for dinner.  My wife, on the other hand, ordered some fried rice with chicken.  Her dish was absolutely amazing and I wish I had ordered it.  Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.    Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed...that I didn't check out this place when I lived in Tremont.   Just visited for the first time last night and WOW! Everything on the menu seems to have a serious punch of flavor.  We all did the Restaurant Week menu: salad/soup, app, entree, drink/dessert. I loved that there weren't stipulations you'd normally expect for a prix fixe menu. My TOKYO-POLITAN was fabulous --not too sweet, not too sour, and definitely full of the good stuff.  I started with the TOM YUM SOUP: spicy lime broth, shrimp, mushroom, lemon grass, basil...a great start to the meal. Perfect amount of heat and the mushrooms were divine.  Next, the BACON GUACAMOLE. Don't think I need to say much about this, I think it'd be impossible to go wrong with bacon + avocado. I had tried this at the Silver Spoon awards, and I think I went back for thirds. That being said, wish it were served with something different than the super fried wonton crisps.  Entree: AVOCADO GREEN CURRY with shrimp: fresh avocado, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion with a spicy green coconut milk curry sauce...I cannot wait to eat the leftovers for lunch! I ordered it extra spicy, but I think I should have gone up a level. It seemed like the tom yum soup packed more heat, but maybe that was just because I had it first.  Our service was great, maybe a little on the slow side, but it was prime-time Friday night. Definitely will be checking out this place again, especially for the happy hour!"}
{"text":"I had a super unpleasant experience. We went around 12:45 on a Saturday, and it was 1:45 by the time we got our food. Our server was terse, not accommodating, and my pad Thai just tasted like salted noodles, nothing like I've ever had before. Huge portion but really expensive for lunch - $15. I would recommend trying something different if you want it to taste authentic."}
{"text":"Yay! I really liked Bac.  A group of girls and I went to try BAC-since none of us had actually tried it. I think it's by far the best Asian fusion restaurant here in Cleveland- the others... are very meh. But this place is definitely good.  The ambiance is very modern and classy. Dark and warm. I liked it, I really did. Our waitress was super attentive, asking us questions, filling our glasses of water right away, giving suggestions of what to order, being descriptive, and even offering to bag our leftovers without us asking. Great waitress.  We ordered the summer rolls and the crepe to start out. The crepe was good-very tasty, for sure. The summer rolls...well, were summer rolls.  For entrees, we all ordered different items. My friend who had the pho- definitely was not a fan of the pho (I didn't try it, she was too far down the table). Another friend and I ordered off the specials- she got the beef stew dish- which was, omg, amazing. The meat was so tender, and the marinade was so flavorful, wow, that was a great dish. I ordered the red noodle curry..thinking it was just going to be like any other curry- and that was the best dish of the night. The noodles were cooked well (so much better than Noodlecat), and everything in it was great- and it wasn't super starchy either, like other curries. Oh, I loved it. Mmmmmmmmmm. I wish it was on their normal menu.  I loved Bac. I want to go back... Mmmmm. A great fusion restaurant in Tremont to definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Came here with bf for happy hour last Friday. Loved it! Got there at 5:50 (Happy hours are from 4-6) and ordered within the last ten minutes. Great seating. There weren't a lot of people there. The bonus was that unlike many happy hours which contain you to the bar seating, Bac lets you sit anywhere. This means we could bring our friends next time and have a nice dinner with great prices! Anyways on to the food... $1 tall boys. We ordered two Oran..something. Bf said the beer was good. Ordered sweet potato fries, bacon guacamole, coconut crepe, classic bahn mi, and grilled pork bahn mi. Every dish was $5. Portion sizes were HUGE. Amazing. Bacon guacamole was my favorite. Coconut crepe and sweet potato fries were good. Bahn mis were tasty, super large and super filling, but I would go to Saigon Grill still for my bahn mi cravings. Nonetheless, bill came out to be around $35 after tax and tip. Left super stuffed and with leftovers. Would def come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a while, and while I still love the food, I've had consecutive less than average experiences.  Two times were dining in with very rushed service.  I'm not sure if they're understaffed or just happened to be extra busy while I was there, but that never makes for a relaxing meal when your server stresses you out.    The last time I was craving Bac, we called for takeout and got placed on hold for 15 MINUTES before I hung up.   When we finally went in person to order, the food is still good but prices went up since I last paid attention.  I don't mind too much, but I can get some good Pho other places for much less.  We also ordered the kimchi noodles, which I have got many times, and it lacked kimchi, big time.  I was craving it and there were maybe 6 little pieces of fermented cabbage in my oodles of noodles.    I'm sad, and want to still love this place, but keep getting disappointed."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant should concentrate on making food that tastes delicious and spend less time harassing its customers.  To quote the owner in a 2012 Scene Magazine story of Cleveland's most interesting people (must have been a slow year for finding interesting people),  \"When we get together, we're making food for 80, 90 people. It's serious stuff. I feel like I could cook in my sleep.\"     Well, the quality of your food actually does taste like you made it in your sleep.   You might consider taking some cooking lessons at Ty Fun.   I had the mango yellow curry last week and it was a watery mess.  It should have come in a glass with a straw."}
{"text":"Bac Restaurant is a new asian bistro and bar that has a lot to offer for all palettes from the vegetarian to the meat lover. To start off, I ordered the gyozas, which I enjoyed alot because they were handmade, while most asian restaurants use frozen dumplings. For my entree, I ordered the curry has a very authentic flavor and spice, and they offer a variety of meats. It has a very chilled out atmosphere perfect for hanging out with friends or taking a date. People I had dinner with could not get enough of the lycheetini and tokyopolitan (I believe that's what it is called). The layout of the place also allows for you to enjoy yourself in a relaxing bar (big too), and the subtle hints of greens brings a very southeast asian flair to the place. The dining area was relaxing and presented very well. Overall, Bac is a great place with a bright future."}
{"text":"I visited Bac for the 1st time last night, and was so pleased!  Our server was attentive and nice, and the food was delicious.  I ordered the basil fried rice and m friend got the pad thai.  Both dishes were great'--I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up fellow yellow owner! Asian fusion places are a major turn off...to Asians.  Even in NYC (where I'm from), can't come across one where it's worth remembering.   This place is an exception. I enjoyed my meal here (the pho broth was flavorful and surprisingly light). Was surprised by the quality and will probably come back once I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a really pleasant restaurant.  We had dinner outside on a mild summer night.  The service was very good and friendly  The food was interesting ( in a very good way).  The cocktails were fabulous.  And Bac himself was genuinely cool.  We started with cocktails.  I had the ginger pear.  That was astounding-- the taste of fresh, ripe pear and fresh ginger was astounding on its own, but also paired (sorry)  beautifully with the food.  Mon cher chou's 17th Parallel was astonishing.  Imagine the flavors of cucumber, lemon grass and basil, slightly sweetened.  It is wonderful!  The lemon grass crab cakes were a neat Asian take on the new england classic.  There was a subtle flavor of lemon grass.  The avacado/lime dipping sauce complimented the dish well.  Our other appetizer, the summer rolls were tender and tasty, although they contained thicker rice noodles instead of the usual glassy vermicelli.  I was interested in the Asian fusion dishes, so I tried the Artichoke pesto pasta.  That was fun.  Think egg noodles sauteed with asian vegetables, lemon grass and a pesto made with walnuts.  No cheese!  It was a really fun take on the classic.  Mon cher chou's basil fried rice was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday I ate the chicken and shrimp pad Thai.  The restaurant is really cool on the inside but, not that big, don't plan on having a party no larger than 8. But other than that everything was great. I gave it four stars for food,service and atmosphere if it was just a little bit bigger then i give it all five"}
{"text":"I went to Bac today to pickup a order that I didn't place. I didn't know the name on the order (totally my fault) but the bartender was incredibly rude about it. I gave a couple of names (which were wrong, again my fault) but also explained that it was a really large order (like over $200 large). I asked her to give me a second while I contacted the person who made it while she's telling me \"I gotta give her something.\" Luckily, a guys comes over and repeats one of the names I had given previously. Yes! That order! I was really early so I waited the 30 minutes that it would take until in was ready. The order was sent with instructions to label all the items. She brought out all the items tied in plastic bags. That's fine but seeing as they were closing soon, my instructions were to make sure everything is there and labeled correctly. She huffed at the fact the I said I needed to go through and double check. \"Have fun with that.\" No offer to go through and help/just be a courteous human being. When I asked for a sharpie to label some of the items that weren't labeled (like sides of rice or meat. It seems nitpicky but My ass is on the line) and some that had just rubbed off due to the heat of the items, I was told \"there's only 1 sharpie and the kitchen won't give it up.\") I don't often give reviews but as someone who's worked in the service industry for a while this really rubbed me the wrong way. The last thing I want to do after my 18 hour day is give someone a hard time. No matter what the amount of the order, just a little bit pretending to care goes a long way."}
{"text":"Bac gets major points for me because we didn't know their hours and showed up about 50 minutes before closing time.  Aside from a few people finishing up drinks at the bar, we were the only diners.  Not once during our meal did we feel that \"We're closing! Get out!\" vibe that sometimes happens when you arrive too close to closing.  Perfect service until we were ready to leave.  We tried the pork rangoon (amazing!) and some kind of tempura sweet potato fries.  For entrees, two people I was dining with had a sweet shrimp dish - which was so, so good but definitely rich.  I tried the (boring, I know) orange chicken and it was also very good and unlike most orange chicken that I've had.  The cocktail menu is interesting and I think between the three of us, we tried all of them. My favorites were one that is very chai-tea-like (the name escapes me) and the Tokyopolitan.  The ambiance is perfect.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!  The restaurant is asian fusion, emphasizing on Vietnamese food. From floor to ceiling, the decor is very chic, yet charming, and the ladies washroom is kinda sexy.  My boy and I have been gone there on several occasions.  He loves the Kobe burger, banh mi and coconut crepes. I love the crab cake, pork chop and mango curry. (yummmm) Bottom line--you can't go wrong.. everything is sooo delicious!!  And the specialty drinks, to die for! I am a fan of the Parallel 17. Its' hints of cucumber and herbs takes me back to summer days, perched on the porch.  I can't wait for their patio to open this summer! Thank you asian fusion restaurant goddess for bring Bac to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a great Pho...this was incredible food.  The Pork Rangoon was amazing and Pho was incredible... everything we ate tonight was superb.  Chef was able to come out and check on us a couple different times.  Incredible experience and really easy to get to!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Not only was the food delicious and creative, but the staff was extremely efficient and friendly. I will definitely visit this place again, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I live in Tremont and this is by far one of my fav places to go here. The Tofu Bahn Mi is only $5 for happy hour! Delicious! And always great service."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend for an early dinner today. We sat out on the patio and ordered mojitos to start. The service was spectacular. Our server made sure to check  on us several times throughout the meal to make sure we were doing okay and quickly cleared the table when we were done eating.  The food was amazing. We had edamame and the green papaya salad (I have to say, the peanuts really make this dish). Both were great choices for appetizers. Then we ordered the special of pan seared sesame (tuna I believe) which came with asparagus. Absolutely delicious. The fish was done to perfection and the portions were just enough without making you feel uncomfortably full. This was my first visit to Bac and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came for the steamed buns, but we left with a belly full of random and delicious Asian food. Love Asian food, but can't decide between Thai, Chinese, or Vietnamese? Bac is the place for you. I love food from every eastern Asian country, and Bac delivers everything to enlighten my taste buds and soothe my cravings. I started with a lychee mojito, probably the best type of mojito I've ever had. It was sweet with a small bite of alcohol at the end of my sips. We wound up ordering steamed pork buns, a banh mi with pork, and the beef pho. Everything was incredibly fresh and perfectly seasoned. I have no idea what type of sauce they put on the pork buns, but it was heavenly. This was our first time at Bac, but not our last."}
{"text":"Just went in for drinks about an hour before closing but the bar tender was friendly. The cocktail drinks were very good and the entrees that were going out smelled amazing. Will definitely be back to try some of those or a small plate or two. For now, I recommend the drink Forbidden Fruit ($7): Absolut Orient Apple Vodka / Mirror of Truth Sake / Hazelnut Ginger Syrup / Mango juice / Soda. I also like the flavour of the Singapore Redux, but be warned the Thai Chili Syrup in it does give it a bit of a peppery kick. It is also $7 and also contains Watershed Gin, Pineapple juice, and lime juice. This restaurant has a medium sized parking lot to the left (north) of it and of course free street parking."}
{"text":"Really cool, great food, nice service.  Our family visited in May 2014.  We went for early dinner (happy hour times) I believe between 3pm -6pm.  Ordered just about as many of the small plates as we could.  There were 3 of us and we had take home.  Food was excellent, new, tasty, drinks very good.  Price for small plate happy hr. perfect !  Try it highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Recommend the spicy quesadillas! Also loved the Pad Thai, but our favorite was the Kimchi Noodles! Loved this place! Was the perfect distance from the Zoo and had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Seriously terrible Asian food. Gets 2 stars solely for their beer list and happy hour. No innovation behind dishes. Come on, at least make them right if they're not original. Will not return"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food. If you want to experience something new it is the place for you. The food can be compared with an expensive NYC restaurant. Here you spend 12 $ for a huge plate."}
{"text":"Very clean, cool atmosphere, good amount of space, and really good food. I had a spicy dish of mango curry, which was quite satisfying. In a good location in Tremont too."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place just recently and I was truly impress ,the service was great and the food was awesome.  The pho was very flavorful but it lack little broth but nevertheless it was very good the garlic chicken wings were the bomb a little heat but not over powering and last the banh mi was not only eye pleasing but very good as well , I never had a chicken banh mi ......oh well I will again for sure I will return.."}
{"text":"This place is pretty dope.  Two thumbs up for the food and the drinks. I plan on taking my family here when they come visit."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. But doesn't make the cut to bump to 4 today.   I came with my bf. I started with a Lychee mojito which was tasty but had very little liquor in it. We got chicken wings: they were spicy, covered in sauce, ok but nothing impressive. We also got the bacon guacamole, and that was amazing. It's served with fried wontons. You can taste the bacon and you get little bites here and there... Great blend on flavors!  We split the beef lo mein for dinner. There was nothing wrong with it, but no need to come here versus any other hole in the wall noodle shop. Overpriced for noodles although it is admittedly a giant portion.  Kudos to them for not skimping on noodles!  The guacamole earned them a half star bonus, but there wasn't enough to set them apart and warrant a bump on the review to a 4 star.   I could come back if someone wanted to try it, but I wouldn't miss it either.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"One of, if not the most consistently amazing restaurants in CLE. Always tough to choose as everything sounds good and I've never had a mediocre dish. I can never pass up the guacamole or Gyoza. Drink-wise, also never had a drink that wasn't perfect, however you MUST get the 17th Parallel. Had the spicy shrimp quesadillas today for the first time. Absolutely incredible. They come with mango salsa and the flavor combo confirms that Bac is a culinary genius. Boyfriend always gets the Pad Thai and it is always exactly as delicious as the first time. OH! and the Pimms #1 Cup was also yummy. Like an old fashioned mixed with a Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"I've been to Bac two times, on both occasions with a mix of Asian and non-Asian friends, all of whom like to eat and talk food. The consensus seems to be that a few choice dishes (the Vietnamese Noodle Salad w/ pork & the Fried Spring Rolls Remix) were real standouts, while the Pho soup, the Pad Thai, the Tom Yum soup, and the Coconut Milk Crepe could benefit from a return to their gastronomical roots. Fusion food is not by definition an adulteration of the original, but something has to taste good in addition to being new. If not, give me the good-old tried-and-true. Here's a quick rundown of the dishes we sampled:  Vietnamese Noodle Salad ($10): Superb, especially with the barbeque pork and if the meat is freshly cooked (see if you can get the slightly fatty bits).  A very generous portion that keeps well as leftovers.  Fried Spring Rolls Remix ($5):  Excellent, gave us all a real sense of the chef's talent in reinventing an Asian classic.  Coconut Milk Crepe ($8): Very good.  Had a nice delicate texture, but could have used more crisp and seasoning.   Pho Soup ($10):  Just OK, everyone all around felt that you'd get better at Superior Pho.  Seemed to have a lot of MSG in the broth.  Pad Thai ($11): Surprisingly bland, where's the tamarind sauce?  You'll get a more invigorating Pad Thai at Ty Fun (Tremont).  Tom Yum Soup ($4): Too much salt killed that usual lovely interplay between spice, lime, and lemongrass. Hard to finish.   All this said, the waitstaff was attentive and hardworking, and Bac has some great Asian beers on draft.  Moreover, I get the sense that the chef is ambitious enough to keep improving the menu.  Give it a try and see what you think!"}
{"text":"Bacon Guacamole.  'Nuff said.  I strongly recommend the happy hour menu, served until 7pm.  It's full of creative fusion items (small plates $5), and tasty cocktails infused with Vietnamese spices.  You can't go wrong.  They've been busy on the weekends, so if you're looking to get in and get out, come on a weekday when it's quiet."}
{"text":"Liked it, will go again! From other yelp reviewers, this place seem like an Asian fusion restaurant, with a tinge of Thai flavor. We went on a Wednesday evening. There was no rush, and even though we made a reservation ahead of time, it did not seem necessary. The weather was beautiful and we opted to sit outside. We were welcomed by the waitress with a beautiful smile. I was not very impressed with the drinks menu as well as the taste of the martinis. The main course was basil fried rice, the portion could easily feed two people. We also had red curry which was served in the huge bowl, and tasted excellent. We also had a couple of appetizers, but what impressed me the most was the dessert. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to surprise her. I sneaked away to request the waitress if she could bring us a cake with a candle on it. She said she did not have cake, but would try her best to get something she would love. And what a wonderful job she did! Out came a plate with fried ice cream, strawberries and a delicious brownie and of course a beautiful candle. My wife was thoroughly surprised and loved every bite of the fried ice cream. This is a wonderful place to hang out with your better half or friends, enjoy a peaceful evening, and top it off with the wonderful dessert. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Go family style or go home!    I think I'm still full and it's the day after.  Plus there's food in the fridge so I'm already pre-full just thinking about lunch!  That's what happens when you do the family style.    Family Style includes a starter of papaya salad, tom yum soup, spring rolls and two entrees.  Each comes with a big ol' spoon for you to dish huge heaping quantities on you and your friends/families plates.  It's the perfect way to try many things on the menu but not have a horrendous bill, in fact, it's only $18 and I guarantee it's worth the money.  The papaya salad is bright and perfect for the summer, the tom yum had shrimp and mushrooms that helped mitigate the clean spicy soup and the spring rolls were to die for (although, I am pretty sure that typically spring rolls aren't fried?  Not like I'm complaining...).  For our two entrees we ordered the avacado curry and the pad thai.  Both...awesome.    Favorite drinks btw: Shanghai Redux and the Lychee Mochito.    So okay, what have we learned here kids?  Bac is great but order family style!  You'd order that stuff off the menu anyway but it ends up being a great price for a great meal.  Got that?  Cool."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  The food and service were both extremely good.  The prices were more than reasonable, especially for the quality.  The service was good.  It's a little \"hipster,\" but that's Tremont for you.  I'm a fan of Asian Fusion, and this place does as good of a job with it as any I've been to."}
{"text":"Beautiful night to sit on the patio. Service started off kind of slow, but our server was very pleasant and accommodating. Tasty drinks. We had the Vietnamese noodle salad and pad Thai. Both very good, but not the best I've ever had. We went on a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded, which was good because we were starving! Would definitely recommend checking it out, cool restaurant in tremont and walking distance to other cool spots."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour! I am a little bummed that this place no longer houses La Tortilla Feliz - because it was my favorite restaurant in CLE. However... I am trying to get over my resentment.   We did appetizers and cocktails. I especially liked the Singapore Redux... a spicy/sweet cocktail. Loved it. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have been here twice and have not reviewed this yet! Bac is a restaurant with a fun, relaxed atmosphere and delicious food. Both times I have gone I have sat outside in the gorgeous weather! My husband has ordered the orange chicken both times, that's how much he loves it. The first time I had the shrimp stir fry from the large plates menu, which was good, and edamame. The second time I ordered two small plates since I wasn't that hungry (we had just come from another event with food). Well two small plates are not really that small! I was impressed by the size of them and had to take some of my food to go. I ordered the ginger salad (yum! And such a large portion) and the summer rolls (shrimp, lettuce, some other yummy things rolled up in there). Cocktails are very good here as well, I ordered the sangria and it was tasty. We have had the fried ice cream dessert the first time we came, and it was fantastic. Didn't have room for dessert the second time, which is disappointing but also a good sign that we enjoyed our dinner. Bac, the owner, always comes out to greet you and see how you are doing while you are dining. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"I ventured to Bac for the first time, solo. And on a Friday night.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a seat at the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and had great recommendations of the menu.   I had the winter rolls, featured menu for the evening.  But I am hoping they make them a permanent item on the menu.  They were really delicious and filling!  With a wasabi and horseradish dipping sauce.  Really well made.  I was so full from the rolls, I decided to order the pad thai for home.  I didn't want to pass up any of the noodle dishes.   The pad thai was fantastic, a HUGE portion and the noodles were awesome!  I didn't care for the chicken in it, a lil dry.  But I would order it again, just vegetarian.  Overall, I can't wait to return to Bac."}
{"text":"There was a mojito with lychee fruit that was really memorable. Had ban mi sandwich. Tried many small plates. Bacon guacamole with a unique kind of tortilla. Pho bowl also awesome. Like I said Tremont is my favorite place for food."}
{"text":"Visited Bac on a pretty snowy day--was definitely worth the journey though.  The bar looked a little slower that night, but the dining room was pretty filled.  I ordered the kimchi noodles, while my girlfriend ordered the vietnamese rice noodles...the portions were huge (in a good way), and everything was cooked perfectly.  The kimchi noodles reminded me of the chinatown food back in Houston that you'd grab around midnight (I could eat it all day).  The staff was fantastic."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and buy the crab cakes!!! Deliciousness  in your mouth. Orange chicken eh. Bacon guac yummy. Spring rolls fantastic"}
