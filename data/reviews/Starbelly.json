{"text":"This place is best for Friday night!! Great selection of wine!! The staff are great!! Food are the best!! i just don't like their patio the last time we went had no much sun shine and no people outside except for one young couples."}
{"text":"Took my \"Dining Babe\" for her birthday to Starbelly in Seton. It was somewhat humerous as, upon arriving in the parking lot on a Monday in the early evening, I was not certain it was even open despite checking Yelp for dining hours. I tentatively pulled the door. Thankfully it opened as I had no \"plan B.\"

We were seated by a hostess and had a minute to take in the scene before our server approached. The restaurant has an interesting set up where part of the kitchen is located centrally and combined with the bar. Seating at the bar is available as well. They also have a 70 person meeting room that is separate from the main part of the restaurant.

Since it was a birthday meal, we started off with a nice bottle of prosseco. The menu is succinct with appetizer section and a charcuterie section. We opted for oysters on the half shell. Our server offered east or west coast, recommending the east which we went with. 

Mains are not what I would call typical which was refreshing. They still offer a burger and a steak nonetheless. Birthday chick ordered a leg of lamb and mash, while I went with the wild boar gnocchi. Meals took a little while to come out, which was nice as it gave us time to digest oysters and gaze into each other's eyes....(sigh)

Meals arrived, hot and fresh. Portions were nicely presented and ample. Both meals were tasty. Gnocchi was light and moist. Wild boar was delicious. Lamb was very good as well. Next trip, lamb will be what I choose! We added a bottle of wine to make it an excellent meal.

I mentioned to the server that it was my omnivorous dining angel's birthday and post-meal, a beautiful piece of dark chocolate tart with a candle arrived (comp'd) which was a nice touch. While I did not have it, only witnessed it walk past, the Root Beer Doughnut looked amazing (this will follow the lamb on next visit)."}
{"text":"This place was a let down. I ordered the Red Sangria, it was very bitter... not sweet at all. I then decided to give the drinks a second go, so I ordered the smoked Caesar, awful. I figured the smokey-ness would be subtle.. It overpowered the whole beverage, which made it super unenjoyable and more like a chore to get down. For my main course I ordered the supreme chicken which came with mashed potatoes and assorted mushrooms. The chicken was hot, the mashed potatoes and mushrooms were cold. Plate all your items at once!!!! I won't be returning. Pricey as well for a small menu with not very good food..."}
{"text":"So good!! This is not your average casual dining/pub fare. You can just taste their passion for good food. The decor is to-die-for adorable and our server was very friendly. This place looks and tastes much more expensive than it is. Delighted to have this restaurant near my home."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great location, easy parking and friendly staff. Food is good but different."}
{"text":"Had an amazing evening. The service was excellent and we didn't have to ask for a thing. The restaurant itself is beautiful and clean washroom. The food was delicious and presented beautifully. We drove across the city to come here and we will be back. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Was here for a breakfast half a year ago and realized they have recently updated their menu so my friend and I decided to come here for dinner.

The reservation was made for 8pm Saturday and it was FULL house when I arrived at 7:50pm, so it must be good? As starters, we ordered beef tartar and mussels in Mediterranean tomato butter.  Beef was just minced right and definitely did not taste like ground beef.  Mussels, not much meat in them although it was very fresh.  For mains, my partner had ordered the clam linguini while I opted for the safe side, house burger.  Both were well portioned for its price. 
There was not much wagyu-ness in my burger after I disassembled it, well maybe the meat was too well done to be noticed. My partner's clam linguini, on the other hand, looked fantastic. Despite the cream mixture covering the pasta, the chef was definitely not cheap as far as combination of seafood, garnished being used in his pasta.  

Since I had to work right after dinner, I did not get a chance to order desserts.  Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience and food was excellent, despite slight wait for food despite the restaurant was full house and also had to handle a 40 people private birthday function.  Although I would definitely given it a thumbs up and recommend people to taste their new menu."}
{"text":"A great addition to the south, Starbelly has a lot of potential but isn't quite there yet. The restaurant itself is huge, the décor is modern and trendy and the menu has a good variety. We went for Sunday brunch and there was lots of room for our large group - a welcome change from smaller breakfast joints downtown. The food itself was alright, however, the service and price left something to be desired. Our waitress had long hair that was not tied back and caused us to cringe as we watched it dangle into some food. The bacon ran $6 for 2 pieces (granted it is smoked in-house) and tea was over $3. For the overall experience the final price definitely seemed high. I may revisit but will be giving them some time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"This is a great little location with great food in the Deep South end of Calgary. 

When you live out in the suburbs it's often hard to find a great neighbourhood resturant that serves above average neighborhood food. One of the greatest things about them is that they have a great commitment to using fresh seasonal ingredients. They make most everything in house from pickles to curing the meat to making sauces. Chef Sobol is bringing great fresh outside the box foods that you would normally find in the trendy areas of town like Kensington or 17th ave to all of us suburbanites. 

The resturant is a nice open space with lots of windows and high ceilings. It has an open kitchen in the centre of the room where you can sit and watch all the action bar style. The main room is filled with many half booths with pillows and always fresh flowers on the tables. 

The several times we have been here the food has been both innovative and delicious. The brunch menu is small but the quality is great although my husband was still a bit hungry after his order of hash as it was a bit small. I shared my eggs Benny with him and the smoked tomato jam was amazing! I also stopped here one day to order lunch to go and was pleasantly surprised to find that the sandwiches and burgers come with both fries and salad. Both the burger and the BLT were great. 

We also attended an evening ticketed event here and where several resturant we have been to are unable to handle the influx of people during a ticketed event both the service and the food were excellent. 

We will be back often and are looking forward to trying out all the seasonal menu items. As a side bonus, they also have buck a shuck oyster nights on Tuesday's so you can indulge and not have to head into the core!"}
{"text":"Starbelly has been on my list of restaurants to try for a while and I finally went last week. The restaurant is really big, spacious and chic. I was planning to try some of the more creative dishes on the menu but when I sat down I wanted a steak instead so I ordered the Ribeye. My partner in crime got the Farmhand burger. My steak was cooked perfectly and the burger was pretty good too. I really liked the fries it had the texture of 'fish and chip' fries. The service was good and i'll go back to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Our group of ten were underwhelmed by our dining experience. After speaking with the GM regarding our dissatisfaction we will be back to try Starbelly in the near future. Looking forward to trying the tasting menu and cracking a nice bottle of vino."}
{"text":"An above average modern restaurant in a bright, stylish space. We went for brunch and everyone was happy with their orders...from flatbreads to eggs Benny to gnocchi all the dishes had a twist in the classic interpretation through the use of fresher, vegetable forward flavours and clean stylish presentation. Notably great fries. The coffee was really good too. The big advantage of being out if the way (unless you're going to the South Campus Hospital) is that you get a good hipsteresque brunch without a lineup."}
{"text":"although the the menu is small everything we have tried so far is delicious we especially enjoy weekend brunch. The atmosphere is vibrant and upbeat with being overbearing."}
{"text":"How come I haven't reviewed Starbelly yet? It opened on Nov. 25 and since then I've been back seven times...
I love the open, bright space and the soothing decor. I especially love the copper accents and open style kitchen with it's wood fired grill front and centre. The chefs know me now and always wave hi when I come in for a meal. 
And I LOVE that it is nearby in my quadrant of the city and that I don't have to schlep all the way downtown to have my socks rocked with delicious food.
Whether by myself or visiting with my family I've had a good chance to peruse the entire menu. Some items are outstanding, some need a little work but all have imagination and are filled with delicious house made ingredients like cured bacon, pastrami, and duck prosciutto. 
Some standout dishes that I absolutely loved: For lunch the Beef Pastrami Sandwich with Habanero Red Cherry Pepper Jelly and Aged Cheddar.
For Dinner: Roasted Mushroom Risotto (which was the risotto of the day feature), Bourbon Honey Glazed Baby Back Ribs, Grilled Country Burger and THOSE FRIES!!!
For Brunch: The Monte Cristo was outstanding.
They also have a full bar with some decent cocktails and their very own Big Rock brew called 'Starbrew'. 
Chef Trevor has a vision for Starbelly. He wants to serve gourmet rustic food with no pretensions, just flavour. If you haven't been to Starbelly yet, don't let the deep SE location deter you...it's worth the drive.
I'm already looking forward to my next visit...which is apparently on Monday!"}
{"text":"Applewood fire-grilled steak was delicious.
Root beer donuts are awesome simply put.
Service was good."}
{"text":"Expensive because the food portions are very small. Food arrived cold, drinks were watered down -  not worth it at all. Too bad because ambiance and server were great. Great potential but food was so disappointing. Feel ripped off - not a positive experience."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried a Sunday Supper at Starbelly yet you're missing out! Absolutely amazing food at such value! I tend to get paralysis by analysis when I look at a menu but these set menus (that change every week) are by far more varied, satisfying and much better quality of food than any other southie spot for the same if not less. 

Tonight's menu was:
Appetizers:
tomato salad (light, fresh perfectly dressed), duck confit poutine (a slightly large portion but the flavor was so good!), dry ribs with spicy honey dipping sauce (I have never in my life had ribs so tender, I was shocked!)
Mains:
Grilled Bryant lake waygu top sirloin (of everything this was my least favorite but don't get me wrong, it wasn't the fault of the dish. It was cooked perfectly rare/med-rare and had great flavor but I think considering that there were a few carby/meaty dishes served before/with that the red meat sat a little heavy for me), red snapper with confit cherry tomatoes olives and pesto (perfection! Light but flavorful. The pesto and tomatoes balanced perfectly with the smokey, light fish with just the right amount of crispness), lemon and parsley spätzle (delightful lemon flavor) , beans and red cabbage (tender crisp broad beans and sweet cooked cabbage), roasted mushrooms (nice and garlicky). 
Dessert:
Sticky apple cake with brown sugar brandy sauce (very moist and flavorful with the delicious brown sugar sauce and ice cream)

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is very minuscule, nitpicky and probably my own fault. The value of this supper is amazing which I love but we almost found the portions too large. If anyone were to say we don't need to eat it all, they are not the type of negative person I need in my life, go away. The challenge was presented and we accepted. But in all seriousness we were very hungry going in and it can be hard to pace and portion yourself over a multi course meal. Eat a little too much of the appetizers and the main is left to look a bit daunting. As they say, hunger is the best seasoning.
The other nitpicky reason was the pace of service. The girls were right on their game tonight and the kitchen was on a roll as well. On any other one shared appetizer, one main each dinner, that quick attentiveness would be 5 stars. However, with so many dishes of substance an almost forced digestive pause between courses would have been kindly received. A slower pace, or only one dish at a time would go well with the theme of a Sunday family dinner. That being said the food was so delicious that I was a vacuum and hoovered the food so I may have given the staff cues I was ready when what I really needed was someone to coach me how to pace myself. 
All in all an amazing dinner!!"}
{"text":"I dine here regularly and have done since it opened. Their food can be tasty but recently, standards have been dropping and they seem to be missing the mark on a lot of things. Previous menus were better. The staff, while extremely friendly and helpful, are painfully slow at service, always. If the restaurant can improve service times and bring their food standards up again, it could be a phenomenal restaurant. For now, it's a so so restaurant in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"This is a joke ,for the money they have put out you would think they would have their A game going .
 When we got there no one to seat us after about five minutes we just walked in and asked if we seat ourselves , they apologized and sat us at a table overlooking the parking lot ( most tables do) .
 Really nice waitress's and went through the mistakes on the menu that are not available , and we had a hard time figuring out the menu .. so you can either pay 18 dollars ,or 24 dollars that's the options nothing in between .
 It's basically sandwiches for lunch or a burger with some salads and two soups .
 We were only one of two tables eating and from the time we ordered to the time the food came was over 40 minutes .
 I ordered the chorizo melt and it was awfull , they fried some chorizo sausage ( could have been hamburger ) and put it on a slice of bread then Melted some cheese on top of it , it was stone cold , the plate was warmer than the food .
 The pastrami sandwich was just that really cold pastrami with cheese slices 
 And a dry stale bun , no condiments , nothing , terrible .
 Burger was a hockey puck wayyyy overcooked and dry ,once again no condiments ,very plain . They should go across the parking lot to fat burger and see how it's done .
 Chicken salad was bland and once again the bun was at least a day of old , not good at all .
 Two of us ordered fries , they were McCain fries, kinda soggy and it must been the bottom of the bag cause the longest fry in the bowl was 3/4 inch .
 Honestly one of the worst lunches I have ever had and I so wanted this place to be good .. Awfull and 90 bucks for 4 people to have lunch , go to fatburger or get a meat pie from save on foods you be way happier ."}
{"text":"Came for Mother's Day brunch. Funny, I ( the mom) didn't get to eat. It took 40 mins for our food to arrive and mine was burnt. What an awful experience. Ruined Mothers Day brunch for us."}
{"text":"We loved StarBelly! Me and my partner enjoy our Saturday night dinner dates and this place exceeded all of our expectations. We made a reservation online and our table was ready as soon as we arrived. The ambiance was a prefect setting for a date night or an evening out with friends. I especially loved the character of the back wall and the unique decor throughout. Our server Chris was one of the best we have ever had. Ever. He was knowledgeable, attentive, patient and gave us a few laughs. Great guy. The food is made fresh and brought in from local farmers which is incomparable to other places in the area. We are from northern Manitoba and we were delighted to see fresh pickerel on the menu. The portion sizes were perfect allowing room for dessert and more wine of course;) We are looking forward to going back. Thanks StarBelly for an exceptional experience all around!

{"text":"I wanted to love it.  I really did.  I tried coming here a few times and for one reason or another was rebuffed.  Either they were not ready or I wasn't available.  Finally the day came and I went!

When you live in a place like the venerable Auburn Bay, there are some drawbacks, like the lack of local fine dining experiences, which now require you to strap into a minivan and drive far, far away.  After waiting and waiting for this place to open, the day finally came and well, I came away somewhat underwhelmed, but hopefully things will get better as time rolls along.

First things first I came for a late lunch.  I am lactose intolerant, so I wanted to make sure that the items didn't have overwhelming amounts of dairy (otherwise I would pay for it later).  For this, the server Brittany did a great job checking with the kitchen staff.

In the end I chose the Spiced Tomato Soup (to be made without added cream) with an order of the Mussels in Mediterranean Tomato Butter (but without the butter, because, well, dairy, lactose intolerance, etc.) which is listed at $18 for Entree with Soup (or Salad, but I didn't pick a salad).  I could have ordered Soup, Salad and Entree for $24.  I also ordered a green tea to have with my lunch for $3.75.  The soup was in a small bowl and very thick (I think the kitchen normally would have added some cream to it to thin it out, but since I didn't have the cream it was more like eating a hearty pasta sauce.  This was OK, and it was very nice on a cold winter's day, but it wasn't what I was expecting - and maybe this was my own fault.  The mussels were OK - there were 12 in my entree, I counted - but again it wasn't what I was expecting.  They were well cleaned and even though I ate every mouthful there was no grit, something I really appreciate that other places don't always do, this was very good.  Maybe the flavour would have been better with the butter, but it was somewhat bland; I couldn't taste the white wine or any other flavours besides tomato, and I think for the price I expected a larger serving, I have had appetizer orders of mussels that contained more mussels than this main course.  At the end I asked the waitress about fries (which, it was noted on the menu, was available) and I was told that a small order of fries would have been an additional $6.  Seeing that I had already finished my lunch, I opted to go and get something else, elsewhere, later on in the afternoon.

After paying over $26 with taxes and tip - I did still tip 15%, after all it wasn't the server's fault that I wasn't satisfied - I was still somewhat hungry.  So, in the end, the place was just OK (and in my opinion a bit on the expensive side, especially considering what you get in terms of portion size)."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a bite and a glass of wine.  Place was pretty low key for a Sunday afternoon.  Mick was the water at the bar and was extremely helpful.  We were just looking for a glass of wine and snack and he guided us to share a Charcuterie plate and Cheese plate which were both outstanding pairing them with the wine of the day Zeneto Pinto Grigio. We have been here before and its always been very good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner this past Friday evening. Table for 6 at 6:30 p.m.
The space itself is larger then ot appears from the outside. Its very open and airy with high ceilings.
The service was very good and our drinks were always kept topped up.
I ordered the steak as well did 3 others from our group. It was very tasty and was accompanied with fries and a clove of roasted garlic.
My wife ordered the halibut which came with a succotash. I had a  taste of my wife's and it was very tasty . I think I'll get that next time.
One of the other party members had a salad and another ordered a salad.
It was unanimous, all the food was very good .
We capped off the meal with a delicious doughnut with ice cream. It's one of the tastiest desserts ever. 
Ill definitely back for another visit. Thanks Starbelly !"}
{"text":"Came for a Saturday brunch with a friend, wanted to stay local in the SE. The atmosphere was great and it looks like it could be a great place to check out at night.
We had simple eggs Benedict. It was okay, I had asked for it on tomatoes or spinach and it came plated on butter lettuce, which truthfully was just odd. Brunch was good, but nothing exceptional. I would have been eager to try their dinner menu, but we felt a bit rushed by the servers to leave, even though the place was empty. That kind of service didn't leave me with the desire to hurry back or stay loyal to the SE."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open, being in my new neighbourhood and all. We decided to go on my birthday.....Mistake. 

We arrived around 8PM and I have to say when we walked in I expected it to be more dim lit. The light seemed kind of harsh to me for that time of night. Anyways, we get seated without a problem but two tables over are screaming toddlers at a table with balloons, (birthday twinsies? cool. whiney wandering children? Not so much) I mention whiney because one of their children kept walking around screaming and going straight into the bar area which was right by our table.. real nice.

So right away the ambience wasn't great, then our server came over. I think she must have been very green to the hospitality scene because she wasn't quite on it. We asked immediately for a bottle of wine to start (since it was about 10 min wait till she came over initially) and I had to ask her when she came back to take our order where our bottle was about another 10 minutes later.

When she did come over to take our order, we asked her a few questions on the menu (Size of dishes, personal preferences, flavours, etc.) and she couldn't answer even what was on their charcuterie only that it has \"some nuts and meat\" great. thanks. 

We ended up ordering the mussels, charcuterie and scallops... we asked her, if we are hungry will this feed us? \"oh yes, this is a lot of food\" she says.

Yeah.... when the food arrives I could have crushed it all myself in a single sitting. The charcuterie was one of the saddest little presentations I've seen in a long time with about 6 slices of meat, 6 crostini's and pine nuts with roasted garlic and some jelly. Mussels were nice, they had an east Indian flair but I also thought it was on the small side. Scallops... meh. 

There was no quality check after we received our food except to come and retrieve the plates and I'm not sure about this establishment but usually when we order a bottle of wine your server comes by to pour, but we ended up just pouring ourselves. 

Overall our service was bad, food mediocre, ambience bad, and the prices did not match up to any of the quality. I am always happy to pay for a good experience, especially regarding food, but this... urg. I hope it gets better because as it stands now, I see this as a \"been there, done that\""}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap eats this is not your spot. If you looking for well prepared quality food with pleasant service this fits the bill.  I have yet to have an average meal and any friends I have taken have been impressed. The seafood tower and steak are both excellent.  The dessert menu is not my favourite but I would rather fill up on starters and my main course.  A nice bonus is stop at The Highlander liquor store next door and take something home. Great selection and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Not a place to go if you're with a large group. 
We went here for brunch yesterday and  it was not a positive experience.
We waited hours for our food, service was slow and inconsistent, tables were finished eating while others were still waiting for their food to be served and many people were complaining about getting mildly warm food. Coffee cups were empty, glasses not refilled, people even had to get their own spoons.
The staff seemed to try but there was just not enough of them to take care of the restaurant and our group.
It's amazing that a restaurant would book in a group of 36 people, months in advance and NOT schedule additional staff to ensure proper service. On top of that, initially the organizer was told that an 18% gratuity would be added in to everyone's checks however it turned into a 20% service charge on the day of the event.  
The worse part? They were well aware that there were issues but nothing was done to rectify the situation (even lowering the tip to 15% would've shown some concern).
I will not be going back, there's plenty of other places to eat in south Calgary."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few time and ordered something different every time. They do burgers pretty well and have a decent wine list. But it could be so much better. Their menu is quite sparse but what I liked least was that they don't go out of their way to give you what you're looking for. For instance, I asked them if they had any soup since it was freezing outside. The answer was \"We don't have soups for dinner.\" Really? Then I asked whether they had spaghetti with meat sauce. The answer was \"no.\" To which I replied, do you have something like that? Again \"no.\"

But if what you like is on the menu and you pair it with a good wine you can still have a decent dinner."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch with friends who live WAY down south. Saying this, cause if you live WAY north of Calgary, a drive down to the South Health Campus is a commitment. But these guys put on some good food, plus allow kids all times of the day, plus portions are good value for the price. Not sad I made the trek.

It is well decorated, bright and really big inside. Kind of country chic without being too pretentious. You can see everything that is going on in the kitchen and bar as the main room surrounds these. They have a large area in the back that can be blocked off for private parties or used as extra seating when they are busy. Really attractive looking room.

We were offered the breakfast menu and the lunch menu so gave everyone lots of options to choose from.

One couple shared the Flame Roasted Sour Dough Flatbread with duck confit, sautéed field onion, walnut basil pesto and a pile of goat cheese. Really tasty and we all got in on having a bite just to help them finish it off / we really wanted a taste.

The boys both had Pastrami Hash which is a nice difference on regular pulled pork you find everywhere else. Chopped up smoked pastrami, peppers, tomatoes, cheese, potato hash, 2x sunnyside up eggs. Sure you would be able to ask for your eggs another way if you really wanted. Good size bowl. Both boys were fill when we were done.

The other 2 girls had the Traditional Benedict. Lovely toasted english muffin with thin sliced back bacon, rhubarb mustard jam, and burnt lemon hollandaise - mmmm so good! Came with potato hash and little green salad.

I got the Starbelly 'Grilled' Cheese - which in my excitement over grilled cheese assumed it was a sandwich. My bad! It was actually a 125g of oven baked brie cheese, topped with cranberries and walnut bits, crostini and local honey on the side. Both saddened it wasn't a sandwich and really excited by the mountain of grilled cheese in front of me. Shared with everyone.

The manager came over shortly afterwards to see how everything was. Told him it was amazing but I wasn't smart and assumed it was a sandwich, and wanted to order the traditional benedict too. I think this may have happened before at breakfast as he knew exactly what I meant and got my order in right away. Came back shortly after and said that my breakfast would be out in 10min. It was, and exactly as ordered. Manager came back a little later to make sure if everything was still ok. Great customer service!

We had a little one with us, and high chair wasn't an issue. Server was very responsive when we asked for the bill in advance to make sure we were all paid in case he got fussy. Had a really lovely brunch and will be back. Like that they take reservations too!"}
{"text":"Hmm this place used to be better and it's not just because they took the delicious risotto off the menu...

I was first off disappointed that it took them 15 min to seat is when half the restaurant was empty and we were only one of two groups waiting. I also found the wine menu decidedly lacking in variety especially of the Canadian reds. 

The appetizer - crab and asparagus dip with toasted baguette was delicious but they either need to halve the dip size or serve it with more bread. They did bring more bread when we asked but it wasn't toasted and seasoned like the original serving. 

The service was food other than the hostess issue noted and the atmosphere is nice though some furniture such as the electric blue bases of the tables stick out as out of place. The table tops are also sticky like the lacquer didn't dry properly.

The reason this is a 2 instead of a 3 star review is the strange entree that sounded better than it tasted - wild boar gnocchi. Presentation was very strange in that they cut up my pea pods? The gnocchi was the size of a mandarin orange as opposed to the regular bite size and as a result didn't seem to cook evenly through and had more of a polenta texture. The sauce was very oily as well though the chard did add a nice flavour."}
{"text":"New head chef! Went for Sunday brunch and it was Delis! You order your eggs separately so you get them how you like them and fresh! Not cheap but a treat:-)"}
{"text":"How can you not define something as perfect when it takes a chance and invests heavily in the burbs! 

Good on this crew and for John to step it up for a seat so far from the action. 
And,.... It gets better every week!!"}
{"text":"I already did a post on their fb page which was completely ignored but long story short; made a reservation requesting a table by the window for brunch...got a tiny table against the window against the curtain that couldn't be further to be in the sun and was sandwiched around 3 other tables, Server was rude, brought us the wrong food 3 times and when we did get our food it was awful. My friend ordered extra bacon and was charged $4 for TWO strips! Unreal.  The opportunity was given for a manager to contact me after my review on their fb page that I wrote right after the experience and no one even bothered to contact me.  Will never repeat again."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in south Calgary! The waitress was knowledgeable and attentive without being annoying. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This used to be an absolute shining star restaurant, especially for the area (deep South Calgary). Unfortunately, things have gone from excellent to above average to just plain. 

The menu used to have a great variety of choices - I'd always be deciding between three or four options which were flavourful and delicious.

Not so much anymore. The food is just okay, the service tends to be a bit off and slow. 

Going to have to take a break from this place for a while until they hopefully get back on track. 

Really disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and the food is always delicious. The service is consistently great. I had the chicken dinner, and my friend had the pork chop. We both agree we will return."}
{"text":"The location is excellent and the restaurant is stunning inside. The service was excellent however the food was less than average on this night. The Burger was overcooked and had cartilage pieces in the meat almost snapped a tooth. The other entre was the Wild Boar gnocchi, it had some strange flavours to it and nothing in it seemed to blend together very well. 
Will try it again"}
{"text":"Try as we might  to be supportive of our local restaurant we are now official done with it. We had out of town company last week and thought we would stay close to home and eat out . I phoned ahead for a reservation and requested not to be in the busy alley way into the restaurant .  Upon arrive that is where they immediately took us.  When I stated our request they did ready a table at the back while they left us waiting in the corridor.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer to start. The appetizer came first and the drinks took forever . Then we ordered a bottle of wine and our dinner. Our dinner came and no wine. We were half finished dinner when the wine finally arrived. We sent it back and said we didn't want it now.  The guys ordered the hamburger which was dry and the bacon was soggy and not crisp .  Our other guest ordered the prime rib which came more like a steak and had been thrown on the grill and browned . We  found there to be much disorganization in the restaurant amoung the staff."}
{"text":"I do not write reviews usually, but my poor mother just brought it up again so I know this isn't just a one-off to be taken lightly.

We thought we'd treat our mom to starbelly for dinner on mothers day. We made reservations for 630. We live in willow park so this was quite a drive down for us but we enjoy trying new restaurants and concepts so we didn't think much of the commute. When we got there the table slated for us was just having their dinner so they invited us to have some drinks at the bar while we wait. No big deal, I figured.

I admit, the wait did take a while but I did not look at my watch because I was enjoying the company of my family while we waited. Apparently my typically laid-back mother was more on the ball. She claims she saw another family enter into the lobby and immediately get escorted to our table. She was not having it. After a discussion with the manager mom asked us to finish our drinks, we paid up and quickly left. It was now 7:10. 40 minutes past our reservation with no table and who knows how much longer of a wait to get food.

Driving back home mom admitted she felt we were discriminated because we are Asian, and that was why we were not given the table we reserved. That's a pretty heavy accusation and I really want to believe it doesn't happen much here, but maybe I've just been lucky most of my life not to experience it. I think it is more likely an inept hostess who maybe even forgot she put us at the bar (but wouldn't she have noticed our name was still on the waiting list?!) Whatever the reason for the situation waiting 40 minutes past ones reservation without a followup is unacceptable. Especially since we had plans for after dinner."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely gorgeous! It reminds me of a beautiful French oyster bar.  The seating is very comfortable.

We come here quite regularly with my grandma, who lives nearby. She loves the mac & cheese and chicken fingers. They are so yummy looking, and tastes gourmet. 

My husband and I usually order the lox Benedict. This Benedict is probably the best you can got in town!  Although, it's weird that it comes with a salad... That's the last thing I want for breakfast.  Fruit would be more appropriate. 

We've also had the lentil pie, which is unique and delicious. We've had the fish as well - it comes on a nice bed of grains, if I remember correctly.

I just wish, as preferring to eat vegetarian, that there were more options on the dinner menu.  Also, the coffee is never good, which deters us sometimes from going for brunch. :("}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Calgary, I dare say. I'm not a local and this place is conveniently close to the hotel I usually stay at. Despite the suburban setting, the kitchen sets an admirable standard. They are especially talented with red meat. Every steak and lamb dish has been cooked just right, adeptly letting the natural flavours of the meat win the day. Mains are complemented with creative sides like cauliflower purée. Service and decor are impeccable. Always have to go there at least once whenever I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and had a great experience both times. Food is good and the menu has a lot of good options. Affordable meals in a great atmosphere. Great wine selection!! One of my new favourite places for sure."}
{"text":"Ah suburbia...where we have an abundance of minivans, stick figure families, soccer fields and franchises. So when we are promised a new fine dining experience that is set to open in summer of 2014, I think its safe to say that the inner hipster foodie in all of us gets really excited.
I know clocks are all different -- I think of summer as July and August although technically it runs from June 20 to September 21 (give or take a day or two depending on who you're talking to). When Starbelly still hadn't opened in October, I figured we were in the long summer but was worried that winter was coming.

Alas! the end of November the doors were opened and we were excited to make time in our busy schedules to enjoy this fine dining experience. Except our server was in jeans -- even the girls serving at the pub make the effort under the guise of Lulus to dress up! The server asked me if tap water was okay. I'm not a snob, so it was. Although, she could have just asked if I wanted a glass of water and I wouldn't have remembered the direct distinction that it was tap.  

This all doesn't even matter if I hadn't been charged $22 for the most boring and bland risotto I have ever had. And the hamburger that they brag about on their facebook page? My husband was so disappointed he wanted to walk over to fatburger where they understand hamburgers.

Here the thing -- Starbelly's menu is part of this trend of family style serving. Which is fun (hey Mercato, you rule at this PS) and works, but your server should tell you this. Especially at a new restaurant, my guess is 90% of the people in there are there for the first time and would like to know how the menu works. Maybe I wouldn't have found the risotto so boring if I had paired it along with other dishes. Maybe I wouldn't still be balking at the $22 price tag of what is essentially rice (it would also be nice had the pricing for that dish been mentioned when I ordered it, i understand it was the chef's \"special,\" but even a ballpark).

Unfortunately, I was hoping they could redeem themselves with brunch, but the reviews online aren't promising.  And although the decor of country kitchen could have worked in a fine dining establishment,  I really hated sitting under the chairs hanging on the wall. Unnerved me for most of the meal.

We won't be back and are awaiting eagerly for the promise of the restaurants opening in the hotels."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch with my grandma and grandpa and it was lovely!

We made a reservation as we had heard it was a very busy place but it was not needed mid-afternoon.

We ordered the burger, the farmers pie (i think thats what it is called) and a kids flatbread with Caesar salad. Good reviews from the pie and burger and my flatbread was lovely along with the caesar salad with amazing homemade dressing...yum!!!

We got a dessert with the kids meals which was three homemade \"tim bit\" style doughnuts and vanilla ice cream with a caramel sauce which in my opinion was the highlight 

Definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"We had a really great dining experience here. This place is far south but we made the trek. Open kitchen...so grill is right out in the bar area. We sat along the bar. It was pretty cool to see the action going on. It did get a tad warm. 

Great staff and service and food was above average!! Prices were really decent for the caliber of great chefs they have here. 

Had a prosecco to start. Tomatoes arugula salad, burger, Cabernet. Dessert was amazing. A cinnamon sugar donut with made by Marcus ice cream. Holy crap! So good. Now to lay on the couch....

Excited to go back and try other dishes! 

Ps: great wine list!"}
{"text":"All the hype about Starbelly...it's time to rethink its position on the podium at Seton.
It's casual decor is too minimalist and it's staff attire way too casual for the price.
The food was average; heavy on salt but average.
Presentation was average...but it's just missing something.
An energy, a vibrancy, or an intimacy; none of these was to be found within the pale wooden decor that is Starbelly.
We were there for a birthday, and the Keg or Milestones would have been a better choice.
Its average.
But that's positively NOT what I had heard or had been expecting."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and the service was down right pathetic especially considering the restaurant was not busy at all. Food is rather bland and nothing special. I am not sure why Starbelly has so much hype around it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and captures essences of a downtown restaurant in suburbia. 

Large dining area with room for small to large groups. The hostess to the servers are super friendly. 

My first experience (group of 8) here was the atmosphere and food are above average. Server was super knowledgeable in providing reason why restaurant exist using local farming ingredients and nearly all items made in house. 

The timing of the appetizers grilled cheese and drink top ups was great. The entrees of risotto and burger seriously took longer than any restaurant should take (order in 6:10pm and entree out at 7:30). 

Dessert was quick as we order donut with vanilla gelato and touch of brown sugar. 

Server was apologetic in length of time for food to come out. 

This is reason why I only can give this place my current rating."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my kids, the atmosphere is very nice. Kids ordered a steak sandwich and burger, also started with lamb ribs. It was good, and portions were good, service was also good, a bit slow as they had lots of tables and not enough staff at the time. I like the openness of the kitchen and bar, great atmosphere and good food, nice place to have a meeting or take the family."}
{"text":"Love Starbelly, it's a real suburban gem way down in the SE in Seton. I have been there quite a few times for brunch, lunch, dinner and specialty events like their set menu for NYE and today to check out their new Market Brunch on Sundays.

Today the restaurant was quite busy for the first weekend of the Market Brunch, people were there celebrating all types of different things from the looks of it. Market Brunch is $25 and you get all you can eat from three different stations - hot, salad/charcuterie, and dessert/waffle station. Plus you can also order specialty eggs that are made to order from your table. It's A LOT of food but very delicious and there's something for everyone. 

Very cute decor that feels cozy and trendy at the same time, they often have other special events going on as I have also been there for a styling/fashion event and Little Modern Market has hosted their events at Starbelly a few different times."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. The space is gorgeous and filled with natural light. Lots of visual interest throughout and love the high ceilings. Part of the space looks like it could be rented out for a decent sized function. I had the kale salad; it was delicious!! Only thing I would change is getting the dressing on the side as there was quite a bit. They also had a great high chair for my 10 month old so that always gets extra points in my books. Not sure about change tables in the washroom (can someone maybe clarify??) but didn't need to change my daughter so forgot to check!"}
{"text":"Right from the start I knew this was not going to be a good experience. We were here for a private function brunch - booked well in advance. The hostess watched  us walk in and then walked away as we approached the front. She joined two servers and the bartender in chatting behind the bar. It took almost 10 minutes for someone to come acknowledge us. When they did come over, they were incredibly rude and barely pointed us towards the room in which we were meant to be. 

The food is subpar at best with very little flavour or anything special to it. Not only that, but it came out incredibly slow and quite cold as well. Considering the building was less than half full, there really wasn't any reason for it to be that slow. There was never once a quality check, or even a server circulating the room, so there was no way to alert someone to any issues. The coffee was cold and bland as well. 

TL;DR: Incredibly bad service, mediocre-at-best food. Doesn't know how to handle private functions (and since that's the case, maybe don't book those events?) I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"Birthday lunch for hubby...I've seen such mixed reviews for this resto and decided to try for ourselves. Upon entry, the resto is spacious and has a modern kitchen feel with rustic themed lights hung on rope. The seating is well spaced and our waitress was helpful and pleasant. Since it was our first time she explained everything was made from scratch/ the bread, mayo, ketchup and the in house cured and smoked bacon. Impressive right?

Hubby takes her suggestion on the beet salad with arugula. Loved it. Fresh, light and well seasoned without tons of dressing. I had the tuna poke with wonton chips. The tuna was a bit fishy for me and the dressing too salty. I'm unsure if the fishiness was from the seaweed flakes or the fish itself. It wasn't offputting but the fish did not seem as fresh as it could be. I still ate it as I was hungry but would not order it again.

Hubby had a burger with fries and said it was satisfying but average when compared to other places whom also use wagyu beef.  I had the brick chicken sandwich with Caesar salad. I found the bread to be overly dense and dry but the rest of it was fairly good. Our son had the Mac n cheese with the house made bacon. His dish was by far the fave item we tasted. The sauce was cheesy, rich and the noodles al dente.  Aside from this being over salty for our taste, it hit the spot! We drank a lot of water in the afternoon:-)

I'd say this place has a lot of potential to be great but it was lacking for me knowing the price point. With a 15% tip, our bill was $102. And we had water while our son had a juice with his meal and no dessert. 

Our family rating is 3.5/5 for the overall experience of food taste and quality, ambience and service."}
{"text":"Came to Calgary for work and stayed across the street at the Residence Inn. It was convenient to go across the street! With the cold weather you wanted something comforting and their Duck Confit flatbread & Risotto was the most amazing thing ever! I came back the very next day and ate again. Compliments to the Chef and the staff was really awesome and hospitable!"}
{"text":"Was at that restaurant for birthday lunch. Not much food selection, service was too slow and overall expensive. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Duck flatbread, beef tartar, clam linguini, all amazing. Great drinks as well, and fantastic service.  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Really nice modern restaurant.  I had the pork chop which was perfectly cooked and delicious.  The mash was well seasoned. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Current Review:

I decided to give Starbelly another 2 visits.

1st visit: everything was great. Service, and food.

2nd visit: everything went 180 degrees to terrible. We asked to cancel our main course as it took an hour and a half to get out burger and pasta. Everyone in the restaurant looked angry.  The manager offered to comp our meal and that was nice but not necessary. We were unfortunately already passed that stage. We will not be retuning.

Inconsistency is a major problem. 


Previous review:


Major points:
1. Reservation was not upheld- we waited for 20 minutes, a group of 16. I have read other reviews that ran into same issue. This is unacceptable. 
2. Dishonest wait staff- the tip was added and the server did not notify anyone of this aspect. The couple next to me double tipped. I know it's written on the menu but we were split into 2 tables. It would have been the honest thing to do.
3. The server was knowledgable on the food product but no sense of urgency in bringing us the bill or being attentive to our drink re orders. 3 hours was our total dinner. Much too long, even with good company.
4. Food and atmosphere was very good. 


Too bad as many restaurants aren't able to execute #4. #1,2,3 can be fixed with better management.

I am willing to give it another try due to close proximity and nice feel. 

I give it 3 stars based on the food and atmosphere. I don't see many of the other 14 people at our table returning for a 2nd visit.

Easily a 5 star restaurant if service improves."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time for brunch yesterday. Brunching on weekends in Calgary can get a little scary so I made a reservation through Yelp for 10am. It wasn't necessary though as my wife and I were only one table of a few people ready to brunch at 10:00 when they opened.

We were greeted by the manager and sat in a half booth in the centre of the restaurant. The layout of the restaurant is interesting. The bar is in the centre with a partially open kitchen. The seating is mostly to one end with a glass walled private party room. The layout makes me think that there's a lot of wasted space where they could fit in more tables, but on that note its nice that you aren't crammed in shoulder to shoulder with everyone else dining if the restaurant were to be packed.

Our server seemed a little timid like maybe it was her first serving job and lacked that edge of confidence you find with more seasoned servers. That being said, she was great. She was on top of everything and our whole experience was flawless.

I had the \"Standard Issue Breakfast\". From reading the menu its your standard eggs, toast, bacon, potatoes, etc. but the actual meal is more elegant and well plated. The eggs were a touch over cooked, but the rest was great. I really enjoyed the sausage. my wife had the french toast. I couldn't convince her to let me try it, but she said it was one of the better french toasts she's had.

Our meal was just shy of $40 +tip for the two of us. About on par with other similar restaurants in the city for brunch.

Just as we had pulled out of the parking lot after our meal my wife realized she left her phone on the table. Before we even had a chance to turn around the manager was calling me to let me know the phone had been forgotten. Great service.

Review #1600"}
{"text":"Booked an overnight stay at the wrong hotel,  but as it turned out, i found Starbelly.  So sometimes things just work out.  Four stars is probably generous, but service can improve a rating and in this case it did. 

I sat outside for a light dinner on 6/12 - i started with ordering a bottle of wine.  I believe it was a Justin.   Decent bottle, but only had two glasses.  So hope someone drank it :) 

I then ordered a small beet salad.  It was very good, but the bowl they give you is ridiculous...way too small for the amount of salad they serve. Could have used a little more goat cheese, but it was very good 

For my main course i ordered the cioppino.  The broth was good, but could have had more spice.    The fish was slightly over cooked, the shell fish was way over cooked.  I'm kind of a cioppono snob, but if you have it on your menu then be prepared for a critique.  I enjoyed the coconut milk flavor...nice twist.   But probably wouldn't order it again...not bad, just not up to my standards. 

Now for the server...what a sweetheart.  She was prompt and attentive, without being overbearing.  She was funny and could joke right along with you.  Always nice for a business traveler, dinning alone.  

Overall i would recommend and i would return."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch-service was great but that is all. At 30 dollars each you would expect much more selection. Only eggs were Benedict, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns and macaroni and cheese.
One small bit of fresh fruit and extremely rare prime rib(?) and waffles. 
They need to put that chef cutting the occasional piece of meat to work at an omelette bar.
Very poor selection- will never return nor recommend."}
{"text":"Food was disappointing....

I had the gnocci which was bland and over cooked. I could barely taste the truffle.

My friend had the grilled chicken burger, the bun was excessively larger than the piece of chicken.

My other friend has a beef burger, which was dry and They forgot the sauce, which made a bad situation worse.

Service was friendly. Nice ambiance, great if you want to go for drinks, but I wouldn't recommend the food."}
{"text":"I had a great time while there with a group last night. Friendly and prompt service, delicious food - I emailed ahead and the chef was very willing to create a vegan selection that wasn't dripping in oil (Farmer's pie with fingerling potatoes instead of mashed). Even the simple side salad was fresh and tasty. The birthday girl had clam linguine and said it was delicious. Starbelly is like a downtown restaurant but with more reasonable prices.  I found the ambiance nice as well, it's well-decorated and has a spacious, open feel. The bathrooms were super clean, which is always nice to see - the whole place felt very clean.  I live centrally so probably wouldn't have checked it out had it not been a friend's choice, but it was well worth the long drive. Would be lovely for a date night."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 6 on a Sunday for Starbelly's market brunch.  We had to wait a bit for the table to be ready as our reservation was for right when they opened.  The interior of this place is very open, modern, and welcoming.  For the brunch, its $25 buffet but you also can order a la carte eggs and have a custom waffle.   I had a mushroom and truffle oil eggs benedict which in and of itself was filling and really tasty.  But the buffet was also insanely good.  They had smoked fried chicken to accompany waffles, an extensive charcuterie selection, fruit, desserts, bacon, potatoes, etc.  I also really enjoyed their pineapple mimosa!  Will for sure be back!"}
