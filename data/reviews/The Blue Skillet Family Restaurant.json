{"text":"Pancakes are soooooo good! And the sourdough toast is great. True diner, friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Been here for 15 mins nobody asked if I wanted water or any kind of food item... It's Vegas seniorita gimme some agua. Yeah after waiting I left. They must of had better things to do than make money. I would possibly understand if they busy, but unfortunately not."}
{"text":"I wanted to love you but we will just be friends. It's not you...it's me....well kind of.

Others have commented on location....honestly the best food I have ever had is typically in the worst area or primitive location in the world. I expected a place like this who only serves breakfast and lunch that breakfast should be ...well ....on point. 

Everything was going great....until I saw the country gravy was NOT homemade....cardinal sin. What true American diner prides itself in instant gravy?  My little ones waffle was beautiful. Omelets were a little overdone but acceptable.  

Crumbs in the booth, dirty windows. Servers were attentive."}
{"text":"if i could this place wouldn't even get one star. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service. Came here w/ my family for mother's day to celebrate & it was the worst experience ever. I ordered the philly steak omelette which was horrible & asked for a manager. Manager took forever to come over & then told me well i ordered what i ordered so it doesn't matter. all i wanted to do was exchange my food for something else. & that was impossible. Monday morning i will be talking above his head. by the way his name is Romero Deleon. Never going back ! Save yourself & go to Ihop seriously"}
{"text":"This homestyle diner is located in what looks like an old Blueberry Hill restaurant, and while the menu is similar, it's not quite as good. And it's pretty pricey as well.

Although we stopped in for lunch, our party of three all ordered breakfast. I had scrambled eggs and chorizo (the \"Pancho Villa\"); my husband had a Philly cheesesteak omelet; and my sister-in-law had biscuits and gravy. Food was fine but nothing special, and the meal set us back $40 (with tip, and just water to drink)! Portions are plentiful, though, so it might do in a pinch if you're hungry for diner food and are in the area with a boatload of cash. Otherwise, keep on driving and find a more affordable option."}
{"text":"Great diner. I ended up in this neighborhood while shopping for Halloween decor.  We were hungry so we stopped at this little diner. 

The place was clean and the staff was accommodating to us and our very large stroller.  I ordered a grilled cheese with curly fries and my husband had a bacon burger. The grilled cheese was good (kind of hard to mess up bread butter and cheese but it does happen).  My husband says his burger, for the price, was excellent.  

No surprises here just good food served by friendly people in a clean environment. Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, friendly staff, they really make you feel welcome. And the blueberry pancakes really are extraordinary."}
{"text":"Not the same place it use to be. 
Food: very very poor quality not worth the cost
I dont recomend this place unless you like poor quality food.
I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, great menu, delicious food!  I drove by many times and glad I finally stopped!

2/23/17 I am revising my review. Our second time was less than impressive. Four of us ordered, 3 were delivered.  The fourth one (mine) arrived 10 minutes later and looked thrown together.  They did take mine off the bill but it's unacceptable to keep one person waiting."}
{"text":"I loved the meatloaf with the smeared gravy on top ssoooo amazing! And service even better! Not once was my coffee ever empty on top of refills."}
{"text":"Great food great service plus WiFi when you enter the restaurant. 
We went in for brunch and were pleased with the welcoming feel. I love diners and I'll definitely be back on my net trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"My dad has been coming here for over 15 years. Orders the exact same thing. I was recently going with him before work as well. The server is always very friendly. Immediately brings our coffee and tea. Arturo is awesome as well!! Never a complaint...we are always in and out completely satisfied!! Pancakes are nice and fluffy. I always get the Bonanza special though..yum!"}
{"text":"Old fashion cooking like you used to have when you were a kid.  Nice, clean friendly service.  

Not the best neighborhood but trustworthy that you'll be served a yummy hot plate of food.

Always filled with regulars and enough room to welcome large families on a busy Sunday."}
{"text":"I eat here about once or twice a week for lunch (my office is located nearby). This is your typical old fashioned, in and out diner. Your seated promptly, drinks are right out and your food order is in within 5 minutes.

Food comes out quickly and good quality. Lots of breakfast/lunch options. Take your check up to the counter when your done and you're back out to your work day."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite figured we would check this place out. What can I say other then I most likely wouldn't return. Food was bland nothing special. Pancake was burned on the bottom, \"chilaquiles verdes\" were gross not authentic at ALL. Ordered over easy eggs came out cooked through the middle. Fake Canned refried beans that' the waitress said \"they made fresh\" which was bs I come from a Mexican family and I know when I taste real frijoles those were def not fresh. Anyways service was fine no complaints on that just would not recommend this spot to anyone. It was pretty empty too. We originally were supposed to go to tacos el Gordo but it was packed so we just came here ."}
{"text":"The waiter forgot almost everything, including water and creamer. The food took very long and the kids meal took 10 minutes longer than the others. Additionally, the bench was so tight and worn out, I was uncomfortable the whole meal. Last, my eggs were way overcooked."}
{"text":"This one of the most disgusting places to eat! The food was horrible not even warm enough. It tastes like the just grabbed it canned food and warmed it in the microwave! Even the service was lame! I will never go there in my whole life!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DISGUSTING.  And I got sick.. Horrible half ass cooked brought me out raw potatoes that were hard, burned ham and burned my pancake. How do you burn a pancake??? Wtf?? Poor owner is gonna end up losing this place due to his cook. Service was good though but horrible cook. Oh and my girls chips were hard and old. Never again will I eat there."}
{"text":"Its a cute little diner. There are a lot of options to choose from off their menu, ranging from common breakfast items to dressed up burgers. They do not let you substitute items, which is a bummer, but the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I was disgusted. The booth they sat us in had bugs all over. There was a hole in the middle of the booth that all the bugs were coming out of. We looked closer and there was a full nest of them!! It was also terrible because the staff acted as if they were surprised and didn't do anything to compensate. When we were leaving, they just wiped down the booth and set it up as usual! That's the worst!"}
{"text":"Got the Irish egg Benedict with corned beef hash and hash browns. Delicious. My husband got the steak and eggs and a side of pancakes with amazing blueberry syrup. Really good portions for the price and good vibe environment."}
{"text":"ouch!   did'nt even look at the menu because we knew what we wanted .... 2 egg &  sausage breakfast,   2 cups of coffee,  1 glass of milk ...  2 people ... $32.19 + $4 tip = $36.19 ... for a no frills breakfast in las vegas .... this is crazy ...more"}
{"text":"I like it. Didn't see any bugs like other reviews stated. Was clean. Does need updating but was clean. Went for breakfast. Was an over abundance of food. Wait staff was prompt and attentive. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is decent. It is a typical breakfast diner with a Mexican flair. The portions are average and prices fair. A nice break from eating on the Vegas strip and cheaper too."}
{"text":"Great good,excellently service. We were stuffed our server was very nice he kept my coffee full. We enjoyed our breakfast everything was delish. The bacon was freshly fried and the pancakes were huge and fluffy."}
{"text":"I work in the area so out of convenience I will visit this restaurant. This place is on a slow decline both quality of food & service keep getting worse. The prices are very high for what you receive & who ever heard of a restaurant where you can't substitute items. No other options just what side the menu says. Being someone who doesn't eat fries paying $10 -$15 a plate makes no sense. I could understand no substitutions on specials but not the whole menu. Give your customers what they want we are paying for it! Every time my co-workers ask to meet here I will be suggesting somewhere"}
{"text":"Very very good. Food was excellent, and the wait staff were friendly and on top of drink refills. Will eat here again and would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal and the service was A-OK.

I don't have much to say about the place except it was average (which is fine)."}
{"text":"I woke up on my birthday earlier this week new to town and craving blueberry pancakes.  We checked the reviews and decided this was the place to try. My breakfast was incredible! My partner had crepes which she described as \"ok\" and lacking in fruit as they were the \"fruit filled\" crepes. 
Cons - I ordered diet coke, which they don't serve and she brought me diet Pepsi without asking. NO. I  will have water before Pepsi.  Also I ordered 2 pancakes and was not told it was just over a dollar more for 4, I would have gladly taken the extras home and eaten the next day. As I said they were incredible!"}
{"text":"Dont let the neighborhood scare you. Its located east on Charleston Blvd and across the commercial complex close to Freemont St at Downtown Las Vegas. They are open early till 4pm and serve a variety of Breakfast food."}
{"text":"Ok so far poor service.  Finally saw the cook bring our food. Waitresses were wrapping silver ware, while the food sat on top , waiting to be served to customers. 
My eggs cold (scrambled) & my husband's were good. All in all very disappointed this time.
Cost for the special & my \"deuces wild,  1 coffee & 1 milk was $23."}
{"text":"Food was good, bugs were not.

We sat our whole meal eating, then when my friend picked up her purse, a handful of bugs scattered out from under it!  There were food crumbs stuck down in the cracks of the seat, seemed to be where the bugs were.  Then we looked more closely and there were more on the windowsill/back of the booth.  All we got was an apology.  Just your typical diner with a big menu, so just go to a different one."}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaraunt several times and have yet to have a bad experience.  I came in around 8am sat at the counter and was greeted promptly by Juan,   the coffee was on my lips and in my belly within 2 minutes of walking through the door.   

After looking through the menu I decided on the Chef's Special of 2 eggs, 2 French toast wedges and choice of ham, 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links.  The bacon (the candy of meats) and eggs were cooked to perfection.  The star of the meal was the French toast so sweet, buttery and tasted just like happiness. I think 2 pieces were just enough as the French toast entree comes with 6 pieces.  Portion sizes are great and prices reasonable. 
 They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day so don't skip out or miss it!  What  an amazing way to start the day. :)  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place on the weekends when we want a big breakfast. We have our usuals every time. Even though we have tried to eat other things from time to time. The sourdough bread is the best that I have ever had, thick cut and delicious. The staff are all wonderful and have been there forever, it's nice to have a place that feels small town in such a large transient city."}
{"text":"I ordered a Ceasar salad through door dash and this is what I received. Gross looking salad! 
Lettuce looks old! Dressing was runny and looked disgusting. Oh and they didn't even include croutons! I spent $15 (free delivery) on this so I am not happy. I wish there were a zero star option."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible!!!!!!!!!! 
Servers sucks so much, i usually never complain but i cant hold it in anymore.

1. They charged me wrongly and they didn't even want to give me a refund. Let me add that they never gave me the refund. The glasses girl said, we cant do a refund. Im like well you calculated wrong, its not my problem to fix. Its yours! 
2. I had to ask for lemons about 3 times 
3. They didnt notify us that they didnt have cucumbers for one of the salads. Which is the only reason my friend ordered the god dam salad. 
4. We just had to continually ask for the same thing to remind our colored eye server. 
5. It wasn't even busy. At most they had about 20-25 people. Honestly thats easy enough to handle especially with 2 servers. 


Theres a lady who has glasses, and another one who has colored eyes. Both need to get fired! Im a server as well and I've never experienced such bad serves. 




Please just go to dennys if you want a decent breakfast because this place really sucks."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Service was quick, accurate and fresh. Good quantity of food. It had a down home family feel in such a big city."}
{"text":"So this place used to be apart of the Blueberry Hill breakfast franchise. Now it's known as the The Blue Skillet since the owner separated from them. It's a true american diner. They have that table area by where the food goes out and there are stools as well as regular tables and booths. Kind of cool too seeing actual food in the glass case as you first come in. The staff is friendly. This place is always packed when I come in the morning probably due to all the car repair places and medical offices nearby. They also have a lunch/dinner menu however I have only experienced the breakfast and it was good. Last visit and had me some biscuits and gravy and it just hit the spot. Menus are on the table and they have someone going around for coffee refills.

I give them a solid 3 stars. I hope to try their lunch/dinner stuff so I can update the review and add a star."}
{"text":"I loved this place on the first glance. When we went in we got a super friendly and personal able waitress who after one time remembers my face and every time I go in greets me with a smile. Now that's what I call customer service!

The first time I went here I got a tuna melt with curly fries, which was awesome. My friend got the french toast, also awesome. This time I got the patty melt with curly fries and man was that delicious too! I want to go back here just to try everything else on the menu because the atmosphere is so diner back in new jersey (which I love). Who could not love it????

It is true the area is not the best but don't be stupid, use common sense and you will be fine. Especially during the day. Long story short I will be back for more delicious breakfast and lunch food and maybe even a milkshake for next time!"}
{"text":"My new regular when I go to Vegas it has a nice hometown feel to it but the food is fresh and the service is great. The food is reasonably priced and breakfast was a blast a nice little gem in Vegas would definitely recommend to all."}
{"text":"Ordered the sampler which is hotcakes potatoes 2eggs sausage bacon and ham i swear i cant find a joint like this around the Henderson Anthem area will be back."}
{"text":"I guess I should've paid more attention when I drove past this place but I was driving. Had I been able to get a better look I would've figured out that it used to be Blueberryhill. However I didn't know that before I went to try them today. When I walked inside I knew it seems all they changed was the name. I wish the quality had improved but it didn't. The eggs and hashbrowns were OK which they are always only going to be OK. Where I had hoped the quality would improve is in the blueberry muffins. Sadly after two or three bites I had no desire to finish them. Service was OK. I will not be coming back to this place though."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for 12th wedding anniversary and renewed our vows. Chapel suggested The Blue Skillet. The best pancakes I have ever had. Homemade. Came back for 14th anniversary and went back for more pancakes. Husband had homemade hash browns. Looked hand cut. Said they were really good. Decor a little old but the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Haven't seen our food but will start out by saying our server is very good, keeping on eye on my coffee and very nice smile that she uses generously!  That alone is worth a star.
Ok, food is digesting and my lovely fiancé and I agree that the food was very good.  Pork chops, pancakes and waffle were great, no complaints on food quality. Have to give it 5 stars but keep in mind our server earned one of them singlehandedly!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Kudos to the cooks, the hostess not so much..... ants crawling all over my food and syrups, hostess didn't bother to replace my dish, and only replace the syrup bottle and Didn't apologize . 0 stars got customer service,"}
{"text":"Stopped in to this diner for breakfast and to get away from the Strip.  We just took a turn on Charleston randomly looking for a place to eat and glad we gave it a try.  The portions were more than enough and tasted good enough to be homemade.  I had the two biscuits with gravy - wow what a plateful with the eggs served separately.  My husband had the huevos rancheros with which there were no complaints.  Thinking our portions might be small we had also a single pancake that turned out to be giant.  Needless to say it was more than enough.  I will recommend to others for a hearty breakfast that's easy on the wallet.  The server wasn't all that friendly but he didn't mess up the order and refilled coffee when needed.  About 9ish in the morning on a weekday there were few other diners."}
