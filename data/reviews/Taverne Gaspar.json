{"text":"Randomly stopped in with some colleagues. Had the fish and chips and they were awesome. Fish was battered but not too heavy and the fries were nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a refresher and do a quick check out thinking I may return for food next day. Stayed for the evening.

I sat at the bar and had 1/2 dozen oysters & the Quebec cheese plate. Different combo for sure, especially considering it was accompanied with a double Hendrik's gin martini. Long story .,

All very good!

The oysters were fresh and delicious and came with a sauce that was original and delightful. The cheese plate was meant for sharing so I got to gorge a little. Very nice selection with fresh firm seedless red grapes on the vine and some greens with apple slices and a chutney. The chutney was very good too. If you do order this combo spill a trace of the oyster sauce on the greens. Great spot. They made no mistakes and the Brie was exceptional."}
{"text":"Very disappointing quality of food especially for the price. VERY pricey for what they give. pub food that should be not more than 15$ a plate is served 35$ and it isnt worth it at all. They make a big deal out of their restaurant calling you many times to confirm reservations and giving you limited time for your supper (it is written 2 hours on the reservation) and when you go there you see that it is...just an ordinary pub. I wont come back there."}
{"text":"Solid food in the heart of Old Montreal! It's basically a big gastropub, with a large bar and lots of tables. It gets kind of loud, but that's fine. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed otherwise. We had an 8:45 reservation, got there at 8:30, and had a pint at the bar. The bartenders were quite busy but still very friendly, which was nice. 

We sat down and ordered some appetizers - I had the steak tartare with the poached quail's egg, which was delicious. My cousin had the pea soup, a dish that I'm not really a fan of in general, but I did try it and they made it well. For dinner we both had their special burger with pork belly and onions. This was very well done too, although it took a VERY long time to come, maybe 45 minutes. Slow service knocks one star off, but the food is definitely worth a return trip.

A great introduction to the pub scene of Montreal!"}
{"text":"Best meal in Montreal so far. Just finished an amazing meal.  The charcuterie plate was big enough for4 (we were a table of 2), with a perfect mix of cheese,meat and vegetables. The salmon was absolutely perfect.  Mussels not as good but it is early in the season"}
{"text":"Great spot. Some of the portions sizes were itty-bitty (ie-appetizers). The \"cheese platter\" had four slices of cheese, which was rather annoying. On the upside, the stead tartar was scrumptious, as were the burgers and the ribs. The place is cozy and warm and chic in a woody, stony, wrought iron-way. Initially, the music was too loud for my Dad so my sister asked them to turn it down...and they did--God bless 'em. The service was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"A modern gastropub that with an energetic vibe.  It is certainly in a touristy part of town, but is clearly one of the more authentic options if you are in Ville-Marie.  I had the Mac and Cheese with lardon which felt like a Roman Carbonara w/ cheddar cheese.  This is a very good thing.  The French Onion Soup was also a nice rendition.  Good service, cool place.  Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Came to Gaspar with a couple friends on a Sunday night.  It was kind of dead, just a few people at the tables.  The space is very big and has an old taverny feel to it.  I really liked the stone walls and wood, made for a cozy atmosphere.  

They have a list of mixed cocktails that have a slew of different liquors.  My favorite liquor, bourbon, was featured in a couple drinks.  I ended up with an Old Fashioned, which I found to be excellent (made with Makers Mark :)).  They also have a slow gin fizz, which intrigues me and will need to be tried next.

We started off with a couple of shared plates (cod fritters, chips and truffle mayo, olives).  The cod fritters were very good, but the chips used with the truffle mayo could use some work.  Olives are olives...kinda hard to mess those up.

As I have given up all animals except for seafood for Lent, I decided to get the standard mussels and frites in white wine sauce.  It was ok, nothing spectacular.  However, perusing the menu, there seems to be somethings I definitely want to try (that tavern burger with pork belly and manchego cheese sounds delicious).

So I definitely need to go back once Lent is over so I can try the various meat dishes that they have."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. I had the cheeseburger and my friend had the pulled pork burger.  Not the most happening place.  Had dificulty getting a reservation but the place was empty."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel Auberge du Vieux-Port. The breakfast is included. For the most part the food is good. The problem is the timing. One meal my entree did not arrive until after my wife was finished. On another occasion we ordered breakfast and sat for over 45 minutes as people who came in and ordered after us were promptly served!"}
{"text":"Poor service, didn't eat the fish and chips. The chips we're swimming in grease and the fish was blah. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Amazing place with strong and professional staff. Celebrating a bachelor party here and ended up here since we stayed close by. Great drinks and solid food. Alexandre at the bar is super friendly and attentive.  We are coming back later !!!!"}
{"text":"Great find in the touristy part of Old Montreal.  The food and drinks were great, everything is reasonably priced for the area.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  

The best part are the roulette shots.  I attached a photo in the photos section.  4 (or more) mixed shots which tasted like sambuca and something sweet, topped with fruit and a tower of glasses and lit on fire.  It's a good show."}
{"text":"I was able to make a last minute Monday night dinner reservation directly on their site which was convenient!

We were so distracted by the \"Grand Marnier\" ice sculpture out front  (who doesn't love an ice sculpture?) that it took us a few tries to figure out which of the large windows was actually the entrance....thankfully the diners seemed too taken by their food to notice us!

As soon as we walked in we both looked at each other and said \"love the decor\" - its very wood and cozy taverne-esque....very nice on a chilly winter's night!

The waitress and host who greeted us at the door were the only small \"miss\" on an otherwise perfect restaurant experience - she seemed distracted and walked away when I told her we had reservations, leaving us to a male host who silently led us to our table in back. 

If I wanted to be picky I would complain that while the restaurant was nowhere near full and had many larger tables available up front, our \"reserved\" table was a tiny rectangle in back stuck to the staircase which appeared to lead to the downstairs kitchen. However, the 2 of us are on the small side, it was a very private spot, it was warmer in back and our waiter and food were so fantastic that we barely noticed the size of our table at the end!

The menu and cocktail menu are not extensive but well thought out and easy to read.  They have different daily \"specials\" for each weekday. Not all of the menu choices were available and the Monday daily special had been replaced by a different option which our waiter took the time to point out and explain to us. 

We started off with the Mango Bellini cocktail - delicious!

We shared the homemade chips with truffle dip - the portion was small but delicious and we were thankful it wasn't any bigger when we saw our main dishes! The homemade chips were thin, crispy waffles and the dip was tasty without being too rich or heavy. 

I had the tavern burger with manchego cheese and pork belly served with onion rings - it was a generous plate - delicious and very filling. My friend had the equally generous cornish hen served with french fries which smelled and apparently tasted just as good. Both plates were served with cole slaw - very fresh and tart. 

We had pudding chomeur for dessert - it hit the spot!

Our waiter was fantatic - very attentive, took the time to explain the menu choices to us, offered us a variety of dipping sauces for the fries, checked up on us with a smile...in short, fantastic!

Would definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"We had a party of four and waited 20 minutes for someone, who happened to be the maitre d', to take our order. After waiting for an extensive period of time, we got our appetizers BEFORE we got our drinks. We waited, waited and waited, and we finally got our entrees one hour and 50 minutes after sitting down. The food was fine, but a bit overpriced, since my fish and chips had more salad on the plate than the fish or chips. No one ordered dessert, including the other impatient customers around us, and no one brought any food home. Plus, we had to wait an additional 25 minutes to receive the check. I would not return to the restaurant, not would I recommend others to go, unless they are willing to wait, then I would recommend a drink or three to hold themselves over."}
{"text":"Never disappoints.

Every time I am in Montreal - I have to go there. Went for a Labour Day weekend, with my friends who also happened to be foodies like myself.

As always - impeccable. Very informal, but fantastic service. My friends said it was one of the best meals they've had. Ever.

Mussels are fantastic; seared scallops with celery root purée are to die for. Mac&cheese (we had a 7 year old with us) was amazing. Tartare -  still one of the best ones I ever had - right temperature, correct texture, awesome taste (the only better one I've tried is at Byblos in Toronto).

Bottom line - I've been coming to Tavern Gaspar for years. And I'll keep coming back. It was definitely a highlight of our short trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent service, spécial 5 à 7 très intéressant. J'y suis allé pendant le spécial 3 services pour 21$ de Montréal à table. Poutine au boeuf braisé intéressante et frites parfaites. Le saumon avec légumes était bien et le dessert , un genre de brownies et crème glacée avec caramel à l'érable, délectable."}
{"text":"Wonderful people, excellent food & service, truly great facility right on the Port of Montreal."}
{"text":"We came for brunch. Service was soooooo slow. We both ordered the classic with bacon. Both our dishes came out with sausage and we told the waitress we ordered bacon she apologized and said she'd come right back with bacon. She never came back. The food was fine nothing to rave about. We wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Solid stop on our trip. We walked in during a hockey game and they a special, pick a players number and if he scores you get a free shot. Service was good and food was decent. Had the full rack of ribs, which were good but nothing stood out."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend during our trip to Montreal. Located in Old Montreal, across the street from the waterfront, this location is perfect after a long day of sightseeing. Very rustic feel and look. I stopped by because I made a reservation for MTL à TABLE a few weeks prior, Montreal's restaurant week. The food was very good. For my first course I had the poutine, and this was by far the best poutine I had during my visit to Montreal (and the others I had were pretty good, which is saying something). The fries were crisp, and they did not overload the poutine with cheese (which is what I prefer). The poutine was topped with an almost brisket-like type of meat that melts in your mouth, and the gravy complimented it perfectly. For my second course, I had the macaroni and cheese, and this was nothing short of amazing as well. Must be one of the top mac and cheeses I have ever had. I believe there were six different type of cheeses baked to perfection, and all blended together perfectly. For dessert, we both had a brownie with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce which was pretty good. I am not a big dessert kind of person so I didn't really have a strong opinion on it. It certainly wasn't bad though. The wine and beer selection were pretty good, although I was not familiar with most of them because I am not from the country. The prices were a little steep ($18 for the mac and cheese!), so I am glad I came here for restaurant week, which was significantly cheaper. The service was very good, and our waiter helped answer any questions we had about the menu. I would definitely consider coming back here when I am in Montreal, and even though the prices are a little high, the food, atmosphere, and service is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Every January, the Antonopoulos group offers especially well-priced table d'hôte menus at its Old Port restaurants in hope of giving Montreal's winter go-out scene a facelift. The event - Happening Gourmand - also encourages people to try these restaurants in hopes of creating new patrons. This year, the event was particularly successful. Tables were booked early and the participating restaurants were buzzing during a month that usually leaves even the best spots high-and-dry. Wanting in on the deal, I decided to try Tavenre Gaspar, the groups' newest addition.

I was excited to try this place. There had been an incredible buzz since its recent opening. We walked in, were greeted in a very friendly and welcoming way and brought to our table. The place is nice - stone walls, vintage art, wooden tables, chandeliers... A great alternative spot for watching the game, especially since it seems conducive to groups. And the music was fun - it included Interpol and Jace Everett (True Blood theme song). All great things.

We all started with the onion soup. Great choice! It was one of the best I've had outside of Paris. The broth had a great consistency - not too thin and not too cluttered with onion pieces - with also the perfect amount of bread and cheese gratiné. Although it was described as a \"bone marrow onion soup\" on the menu, there wasn't very much bone marrow. However, considering how delicious it was, I really didn't mind. (Like, du tout.)

The main dishes were hit and miss. I had the duck confit with fries and salad. The salad was good, nice and fresh. The fries were just \"there\" - they weren't particularly delicious or interesting. And the duck... It was... Ok. Tender on the inside, but somehow strangely fried on the outside? It almost had a breaded consistency?? I've had many duck confits throughout my foodie existence, and this was definitely the least exciting of them all. Strange, since the deliciousness of the dish essentially stems from the meat being cooked in its own fat... I didn't think such a simple and classic dish could be brought down to the level of \"meh\".

My friends both had the Taverne burger with manchego and pork belly, accompanied by onion rings. The burgers were good - not too dry or overcooked - and the pork belly was a pleasant addition. The onion rings were nice and crispy and weren't too battered up. Cool.

Time for dessert. I had the chocolate flan and unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan. Made with dark chocolate, it was made in the style of a flourless chocolate cake. Yet it was so crazy sweet that the whole point of making something with bitter dark chocolate was lost on me. It just tasted like under-baked regular cake.

My friends both had the bread pudding - a comfort food classic. Again, just ok. And again, way too sweet. I know, we're taking about dessert here, right? But the \"bread\" was a sort of seriously saccharine version of a vanilla pound cake, and paired with caramel ice cream and thick caramel \"syrup\", it was too much. ADD in a bowl.

There's one last thing I have to add: Gaspar has strange white lighting. It lines the walls and emanates from the chandeliers, and it takes away from both the tavern and dinner ambiance. Restaurants are supposed to create a sense of intimacy and make people look especially hot with their slightly dimmed \"yellow\" lighting. With relatively bright white lights all over the place, Gaspar doesn't allow for either of those and establishes a slightly awkward ambiance.

So, is this a place for a nice dinner? All in all, Taverne Gaspar lacks a certain finesse. Yes, it's a tavern and it's not supposed to have the most innovative menu fine cuisine, but considering its owners, its location, its decor and its image, the food should be better. Currently, it's mediocre - not terrible but not delicious. Maybe the quality decreased due to the cheaper menu and rush of the Happening Gourmand event? Maybe Taverne Gaspar should be known for its house beer and specialty drinks rather than for its food? I don't know. But my experience won't have my 5-inch heels running back for more very soon... Unless it's for onion soup.

{"text":"Wow. What a disappointment. Sat at the roof part of the restaurant and was not pleased with anything other than the breeze and the view. We ordered a beer and a cocktail with a waitress that did not crack a smile ONCE! We ordered guacamole and chips, maybe the worst ever. The guacamole tasted like it was out of a jar from the supermarket. Could they not have made guacamole out of real avocados? Based on the app, we decided there were better places to go. Sorry Gaspar, no go."}
{"text":"Superbe bar sur la rue de la commune dans le vieux port. 

La déco avec les foyers, les grosses pierres et le bois est sublime. Les serveuses sont adorables et bien renseignées. Nous n'y avons mangé que le dessert, mais ce fut exactement ce que je désirais : un bon pudding chômeur bien chaud !  Bonne sélection de digestifs également : scotch, cidres de glace, sauternes, portos. 

Je me permet de mettre un 4 étoiles et réviserai ma note lorsque j'y aurai mangé un repas."}
{"text":"Loved this loud and lively basement pub. They have a $26 prix fixed which is a great bargain. For that, I had a large beet and orange salad, at least a pound of erfectly cooked moules frites with a cream Pernod  and a smores dessert. Excellent beer selection, not huge but more than adequate.All were delicious. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"A group of 8 we met here to pass a few weekend hours. Within my choices at Old Port this place does not rank high. The service was descent though. The menu could have offered more choices (comparatively) . I picked moules. The portion was standard but there was only one option for the sauce and it was not my favourite. They do not serve their own beer (this is not a negative per se but an interesting thing for me to explore) hence I ordered some amber belle gueule which I liked.
The staff were nice and friendly. It is bar-noisy and not a baby friendly place I say."}
{"text":"The drinks are great and the food is ok.
Nice place to have drinks with friends and try new cocktail."}
{"text":"Very average food and below average service. With so many better places nearby in old Montreal we won't be back.  It was well rated on open table so we booked it. It was not anyplace I would recommend in the future.  Great location and decor but that is all."}
{"text":"Vu que j'étais dans le vieux Montréal, j'ai voulu essayé ce fameux pub gastronomique taverne Gaspar !

Le décor est splendide, très confortable, et que dire du menu ! 

Des drinks superbes et origineaux !

J'ai dégusté le fish and chip qui est définitivement le meilleur que j'ai jamais mangé ! La morue était fraiche avec une panure juste la bonne épaisseur et le goût excellent.

Ma blonde a essayée le burger et a été agréablement surprise !

Malgré le fait que je trouve ça toujours trop cher de payer 20$ pour un burger des frites et une salade, c'est vraiment excellent !

Donc si vous voulez déguster un excellent repas dans le vieux Montréal aller faire un tour à ce splendide pub !

 Vous ne serez pas déçu. 

Les micro brasseries devraient prendre exemple sur ce pub et nous fignoler de quoi exciter nos papilles gustatives !



As i was spending a day in old Montreal, i wanted to taste the famous Gaspar Tavern !

The decorations are nice and comfy and what about the menu !

I taste the best fish n chip i ever eaten ! The cod was flaky with just enough bread on it. And drinks are nice.


My babe choose the burger and it taste extraordinary !

Despite the fact that i always think 20$ is a bit pricey for a burger, fries and salad, it's really good.

Si if you want to have a nice meal in old Montreal go to this pub ! You won't be disappointed !

Micro brewers should do like this pub and excite our taste buds by tweaking nice originals meals !"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting Montreal for the first time this past four days.  I was with a group of friends from San Antonio, Texas, there on business.  We were blessed to find Taverne Gaspar by total luck on our first night there.  We had the pleasure of meeting the amazing bartender Catherine who treated us like royalty and amazed us with her creativity and talent in making us her concoctions.  She was friendly, entertaining and beautiful.  She was so amazing at making us feel so special that we had to come a couple of days later and brought a bigger group to meet up with Catherine.  Again, she gained the respect from all of us with her talent. professionalism and fabulous personality!  I highly recommend the awesome atmosphere of the place and the wonderful staff.  It's an addictive combination."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were superb but the best part was our server Dominic. He read our mind and our mood about what food to order - we enjoyed delicious fish and chips, amazing fresh fish and salad, a non-alocholic beer and a great dark and stormy. We ate outside with perfect people watching in the old port and Dominic made the night spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Endroit relax pour le happy hour du jeudi soir! J'y suis allé pendant le festival du \"happening gourmand\" et le menu à $25 était tout à fait délicieux!  Cet endroit semble être le repère de prédilection pour les gens qui sortent ensuite à l'Igloofest!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner. Some stuff was good, like the poutine, the trout and the chicken."}
{"text":"Arrived late at our hotel (St. Suplice) and needed a meal and some beer fast. Husband used Trip Advisor to find out what was open, within walking distance. Found Gaspar. 

Great looking place - dark wood and a homey feel while still being a touch upscale. The person greeting us was Charles, and he sat us by the window so we could enjoy looking out at the evening. 

Brought us 2 Broken 7 IPAs, in giant glasses that we were tempted to bring home with us. Delicious. 

My husband had the french onion soup, said it was one of the best he's ever had. He also had the duck confit grilled cheese, which was outstanding. I had  the tavern burger, done to perfection. Fries were way too salty so I only had a few and left the rest. 

Charles gave us space but was attentive, which I always like in a restaurant. I mentioned it was my birthday so he got shots for us and did one with us. Super sweet! 

My only complaint was the music volume. It was so loud we couldn't have a conversation with one another at our small table. I did however enjoy using Soundhound to find out what French language music I was hearing. 

I'd recommend for drinks and dinner, and if the lovely, tall, thin charming Charles is your waiter, you'll be well cared for."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this restaurant after several others told us that they had hour long wait lists that they couldn't put us on unless we waited directly in front of the restaurant (odd system Montréal... but I digress). Started out with the mussels and fries to share. Amazing! We ate them like we had never seen food before - probably reenforcing all sorts of American stereotypes. The fries were so delicious that we ordered another batch. We then had salads - chicken and tuna. Both amazing. Please eat here. 

Also - we drank lots of wine, and the ambience outside was lovely. The staff was super nice which I found to be unique compared to the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"A cozy, old-school tavern built from stone and wood. It's spacious and dimly lit. I love the look and feel, but that's pretty much as far as it goes. 

Maybe it just so happened to be mediocre the night that I went? I don't know. It was quiet, the food was nothing to write home about, the wine was good. Even our waiter was a little... weird (putting it mildly).

They're probably better as a gastropub than a restaurant, I'd go back just once more to make sure."}
{"text":"I was here for Christmas dinner with my sister, and it was pretty disappointing. She ordered a green salad as she wasn't very hungry, and I ordered the lobster sliders. Her salad was tiny and excessively oily. The oil was dripping off her lettuce. My lobster sliders were reminiscent of McDonald's lobster rolls: they tasted more like canned tuna than lobster. The sliders also came with gourmet chips, which were barbecue flavoured and good. The small salad on the side of the plate, like my sister's was also very oily. 

The service was extremely slow. There was one server for the entire front room and it was impossible to get a hold of her. We wanted to finish our meal with a cheese plate, but having such a hard time waving down the server and the food being mediocre to begin with, we decided to just get the bill and find somewhere else to grab a bite.

Disappointed with this place, especially considering all the positive reviews. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink. Took 30 minutes to get our drinks. Nothing special at all. Food seemed mediocre but didn't try it."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of staying at Auberge Du Vieux Port hotel and this restaurant was attached to it  How convenient.  The drinks are sexy, the decor and servers had a steakpunk vibe to it and the food offerings are \"solid\" as mentioned by the previous reviewer.  They have good French comfort food, which will remind you of any good bistro.  I had the grilled scallops with Puy lentils and French beans while my boyfriend had the mac and cheese, which was packed with chunks of bacon.  (I only ever experience Puy lentils when I am in Montreal).  We enjoyed our food immensely and wish we could have everything on the menu.  Definitely coming back here next time."}
{"text":"The poutine is kick butt!! Cheese curds were cold on it the last time, but still didn't stop me from devouring it. 
Service is European style (not very attentive) but whatever, you're not in the USA anymore."}
{"text":"I can't take a trip to Montreal without stopping here. I've loved it ever since my wife and I stayed at L'Auberge next door. For us, the shining star of this tavern is, surprisingly, the breakfasts! Coffee is perfect every time, the crepes are amazing in flavors, eggs Benedict is never off and the service has always been spot on great. Best thing I recall ordering for breakfast is the salmon eggs Benedict.

Drinks are nice and I've enjoyed the beer selection when we've been here on afternoon stops.

It has the vibe of an old-timey tavern but is welcoming and has plenty of sit down table seating. The staff is so very welcoming and I think of that charm every time I think of Montreal in general.

The location is pretty great too. They have a very nice outdoor seating area right on Rue De La Commune where you can see the passerbys along the old port."}
{"text":"Exceptional breakfast!  

Stayed at the Auberge Viex Port hotel and the breakfast is included.

They open for breakfast at 7:30am (went on a Friday morning), and I was served, eaten, and out by 7:55am!  

If a guest at the hotel, then you may choose from about 6 options (denoted by a star on the menu).  The choices were great!  Crepes, egg's Benedict, 2 eggs and bacon... Very good options!  Not your typical continental breakfast!

Got the egg's Benedict with hollandaise sauce and it was superb!  It was served with bacon on an English muffin.  Eggs were perfectly poached with the goodness of yolk with every bite.  The bacon was thoroughly cooked, but not dark and burnt.

My companion ordered 2 eggs turned over with bacon; he enjoyed it very much as well.  The eggs were perfectly made and the plate was a good size.  His breakfast came with toast.

We each had a small bowl of fruits and the tea/coffee comes with the meal.

The waitress simply asks for your room number (if a guest at the hotel), and you just need to sign the receipt.  

Note that you may order from the rest of the menu that's not denoted with a star; you simply pay the difference and is charged to your hotel room.

***

I came to this resto one other time prior during the food festival and the food is just as delish during the evening.  Great portions and a hearty meal!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Gaspar was lovely!  We escaped there for supper with our toddler after a less-than-sterling time at Pub-St.-Paul as part of a large gathering, and it soothed us into recognizing that we had, indeed, found the quality Quebecois fare that we had sought.

My steak frites were lovely, with meat that was a perfect medium-rare.  My husband attempted to order his burger medium-rare, but was informed that the burgers only come medium-well, and that this is the case within all of Canada.  Now, I can respect a restaurant that is sufficiently confident in their dishes to only serve them in the way that they were designed to be served, but we did both think that the the burger would have been tastier medium-rare.  The pork belly was a nice addition.

Our server was very friendly and accommodating, which is hugely gratifying when traveling with a toddler.  We felt completely at ease eating with him there, which we weren't at first certain would be the case given the menu and decor.  We felt welcomed and valued, and appreciated the warm smiles from other staff as well.

We're thinking about heading back up to Montreal in the spring or summer, with the aim of hitting a number of amazing-sounding eateries that we didn't try the first time.  Other than Au Pied de Cochon, which would be the main reason for the trip, Taverne Gaspar is probably the only place we visited this time that we'd give a second try on a very limited engagement, thus giving up the opportunity to try someplace new for that meal.  It has definitely earned a return visit."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of our hotel's concierge and were very disappointed. The space is pretty cozy and service was good, but the food was not. Everything we had was bland, from the chicken to the burger to the poutine (we actually didn't finish it- sacrilege!). Regretting we wasted one of our two nights in Montreal eating here."}
{"text":"It's definitely A-OKAY!

We started with the poutine appetizer, which was very, quite tasty.

Nice atmosphere inside, real nice....

The beer selection was pretty good too.  Some good stuff.

I had the game burger, and it was loaded with a bunch of different thang thangys on top...  And an absolutely huge bun!  The type of burger that you bite into and the thing goes all over the place like in the movie \"Vacation\" with Chevy Chase.

It was messy but tasty.

Its a fine place for pub fare, and I would leave it at that."}
{"text":"It's a good spot, not great, I would say the vibe is similar to a sports bar or a mid-high end chain resto in the US. I found it was a bit pricey for you get. And in this neighborhood there are too many options to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Walked in from the street for a martini. The pour was generous and the bartender was very pleasant. We had a plate with deli meat and assorted cheeses that was quite filling  as a small course. Overall I thought this was a great palace  to have a drink. We saw some seafood dishes going out which looked excellent."}
{"text":"Took a couple of colleges who were in from out of town to this place on Tuesday night. 

Place is very cool inside, decor is nice, tables nicely spaced. They have several local beers - very good.

We were very disappointed with the food however. As a starter we tried the Poutine - it was supposed to have some meat in it, I think - didn't see any. It was barely warm, cheese curds not melted - I mentioned this to the waiter and he simply said \"Noted\". The dish has potential though as the fries and sauce had good flavor.

2 of us had the ribs - they tasted as though they had been boiled and then had some sauce painted on after the fact. They were very very fatty, though tender. Ribs were served on top of the fires which was a bit odd. Overall taste wasn't  great. Note to chef: Go to Baton Rouge, try their ribs and use this as a benchmark.

One of us had the mussels - he referred to these as \"erasers in shells\" - they were warm, not hot, and the sauce was not to his liking (may just be a preference thing).

Overall very disappointing - aside from the good beers and atmosphere.

{"text":"I visited Gapsar a few times in the past for 5a7 drinks and didnt know what to expect from a dinner perspective. Ambiance was nice,  a little noisy but we were a big group (and a noisy one at that) so the setting was perfect. 

I ordered from the $22 menu which offers you an appetizer,  main and dessert. I ordered (after a 30 min wait) the leak and potatoes soup (which took another 30 minutes to be served),  the ribs and fries (served with coleslaw and spicy mayo) with a vanilla mousse dessert. 

Needless to say,  I was underwhelmed. The soup was tiny,  lacked flavour and was lukewarm. The ribs were ok...nothing special. The fries,  though,  were great. If you find yourself in the Old Port,  do yourself a favor. Go elsewhere unless you like waiting."}
{"text":"To reiterate my charming companion, and her meager-looking Jamieson...

Came here on a rainy Wednesday @ 6ish. The crowd was a mix of tourists and business folk. I suspect this place is more happening on the week-end. They might want to try a happy-hour drinks/food menu to draw in a more hip, local crowd during off-times.

Do NOT order the \"popcorn\" sweetbreads. I was expecting substantial nuggets of hot, crispy-coated offal with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. What I got was luke-warm, flour-dusted bits of sweetbreads, with some droplets of sauce, drowning in too-large cuts of green onion as garnish... I expect to impart an Asian feeling? Mission not accomplished.

The bartender, after giving great service the whole evening, asked what I had thought of them, and promptly took them off my bill after she received a resounding, \"Meh?\", even though I had ordered nothing else but tap water.

In conclusion... Great service, good fancy-business ambiance, probably happening on the weekend, but don't use it as an opportunity to round out your Facebook Food List Challenge.

PS. I really want to give this place 2 1/2 stars, but since there's no option it gets 3 'cause I'm nice :)"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here as part of our stay at Auberge du Vieux-Port, and it did not disappoint. The service was very friendly, the food was tasty and reasonably-priced, and the atmosphere was awesome. Also had drinks the night before, and their house beer was excellent, while cocktails were relatively strong and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this gastropub. We came here on a quiet Tuesday evening and were told we would have 2 waiters and another waiter in training. Based on that, I thought we would have stellar service, but it was lacking. My husband and I like to try different beer, especially trying local brews. So we decided to try a sampler of 4 of their 10 offerings, only to find out that we did not get to pick which ones to try...really, never heard of that. The beer is nothing to rave about. We both had the Onion Soup which was recommended and I have to say that it was delicious. We were served our entrees right after finishing our soup. I don't understand why restaurants do this...it wasn't crowded and we were not in a rush. Anyway, my Macaroni and cheese was very good- it came out hot and the serving size was large. My husband ordered his steak medium rare and it came out VERY RARE, practically raw! The cut of meat was good and my husband ate it and hoped he wouldn't get sick (he didn't). I like my steak cooked rare and it was a little too rare for me. The fries were good. None of our servers came by to check on us until we were about half way through. We decided to share some Raspberry Sorbet  for dessert. It took 1/2 an hour to get to our table. Oops...we gave it to the wrong table and they ate it (free of charge). When I asked if we would have to pay, the waiter checked and told us it would be taken off our bill. It was delicious and there were 3 large scoops. The atmosphere of the tavern is very appealing, attached to a hotel next door. Oh, and no wifi! It could have been a much better experience for us. Sorry Gaspar, there are many other places to try in Montreal. We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a treat! One of my favorite experiences as a first-time visitor to Montreal was Taverne Gaspar. Cool atmosphere and superb drinks by Catherine (the best bartender) made me want to return a few nights later to share the experience with our other traveling companions. They loved it as well--who wouldn't?! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I visited this pub for a quick drink and bite to eat whole visiting with a friend. We loved the decor, though if you enter through the upper part of the street you first see an office space. Which was a bit confusing. But once we found our way to the bar we were greeted by a very friendly bartender. I think his name was Matt, he was great!  Gave us suggestions on what beers were a must try, and also suggestions on fare. We had a special burger they had on promotion that week and a cheese platter. The only negative was the dude who sat next to us at the bar talking so loud on his cell phone about how his girlfriend needed to lose then pounds to be hot, for over an hour. That guy was a jerk. But the Tavern was amazing!"}
{"text":"Just eat steak tartar there and got food poisoning. Which make me believe that have very poor quality food. If you go there just eat everything cooked."}
{"text":"Enjoyable lunch option, when exploring down by the waterfront. The waiter helped me choose a beer closest to my preference. The burger was great, and I never had a lobster roll with curry and I enjoyed it. The poutine here was VERY filling, it is probably all you need. 

Good:
-Artichoke Dip
-Beef Flank Steak
-Tavern Cheeseburger
-Mini Lobster Roll (curry flavored)
-Poutine (as a main, or side) STICKS TO YOUR RIBS
-Waiter was helpful and polite

Bad:
-None"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast at this restaurant that overlooks the Old Port in Montreal.  The ambience was nice and the food was decent.  The downside is that the service was incredibly slow and it appeared that they were grossly understaffed.  One person in our party ordered eggs over hard, but they were cooked over easy. She was also given a coffee mug that was dirty on the outside.  Aside from the service, however, we enjoyed our meals and found the prices to be very reasonable."}
{"text":"I found it laughable how there's a \"cheat line\" on the wine glass so that whoever pours the wine makes sure they give the correct amount. Interestingly, there were 2 lines on the wine glass and my wine was filled to the \"lower line\". Not like it makes a huge difference as the wine was sub par. Excellent location that you cannot beat after the fireworks and the veggies were seasoned perfectly. The food is hit or miss, the wine is MISS."}
{"text":"Another tourist trap! Junky chips and guacamole that were so plain. Our kids fish and chips was mostly batter with tough chewy fish on a bed of smushed cold fries. They didn't bring our food and when we finally asked the waiter claimed are you ready for your second service? So after almost an hour you want to just now put in our order for our dinner??? Apparently he said this is how it is done in Montreal. It was not our experience anywhere else in Montreal but apparently in this place it is the case. We left tired, offended, having eaten a few fries and missed out on the old port activities with the time we wasted waiting for our food. To top it all off instead of an apology we get a backhanded comment that we'll just throw the food away. Staff is rude, food is like cheap, sub-par bar food, and wait and prices are ridiculous. 40 bucks for that nasty fish and chips and a plate of store bought chips with a small cup of guacamole. No thank you!"}
{"text":"Cozy English-style gastropub is good for groups or those seeking something more intimate. Fairly standard menu - we had arugula salad and pea soup to start, then baked salmon over lentils and lamb shank - all very tasty.
Extensive cocktail and wine menu as well, I tried a local lager that was very good."}
{"text":"Had the onion soup as recommended - pretty tasty.  I also had a flavourless beef tartare that was absent any seasoning and, most tragically, any yolk.  Sitting at the bar, service was unacceptably slow - no offers to refill water, no asking how food was, despite standing in front of me."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, cocktails and wine either enjoyed on the patio in Old Port or inside the cozy bar.  Rumor has it that there's also a rooftop space!  Ludavic rocks!!"}
{"text":"Went there for drinks late night.  Nothing special, although the service was good."}
{"text":"This pub definitely made our first trip to Montreal memorable and lots of fun!  We went the first night for a drink since it was connected to our hotel, Auberge Vieux Port (also great!), but returned 2 more nights for a late night drink, and then dinner, because of the great staff and drinks.  Alexa, Sabrina and Julien were all super friendly, freely giving us recommendations on places to go, and keeping up great conversation during the evening.  Really good people!  Great beer selection and cocktails, and the poutine, burger and grilled cheese were all delicious!  It will definitely be our first stop the next time we're back in town."}
{"text":"Really lovely spot in the old section of Montreal.  We sat outside and it was cold, but pleasant. A view of the park and all of the Canada 150 celebrations were great.  Food was good, though the ambiance was most memorable."}
{"text":"Very good burger, and very good fish! The tequila fizz is delicious and the César Gaspar drink is amazing. A little bit ok the expensive side, but totally worth it"}
{"text":"Was a little dissapointed as I was expecting music on a wed. night but apparently that is just Thursdays now. But the waitor was nice the Martini was solid and I enjoyed the French Onion soup made the tradiational way and the salmon tartar which was a mix of raw and cooked salmon., Def worth a try"}
{"text":"The time from ordering our food to receiving it was the longest I have ever waited at a restaurant. When we finally got the food, it was just \"okay.\" I ordered a side of bacon that never arrived, it was taken off the check. We also asked for glasses of water, which we never got. The service is not very good and the food is only mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I was going to go with Meh, 2 stars, because that's how I feel, but the gal behind the bar deserves a couple stars all her own. 8$ for a small shot of Jameson? Alright, I guess I'll allow it since we're in an old stone room in the old port. This vibe should have been cozy and right up my alley but left me feeling all businessny aaaand shrug. My charming companion ordered the popcorn sweetbreads and they were a bit greasy and flavourless - but these were comp'd when the waitress saw her sad shrug, so I reiterate: much love for the service, but something else here is definitely missing."}
{"text":"Nice tavern, loved the atmosphere which is cool & friendly. Service was ok. Prices are high for the food quality but it was overall a good experience"}
{"text":"Food was good to great, not a huge selection, but the quality makes up for it. The service was good, but since it was a Monday night, and not very busy this might not be a good indicator of service on busy night. Also more expensive than the $$ would indicate to me. Loved the decor."}
{"text":"This place is top!  Had the pleasure of having the 3 course meal as part of a deal with our hotel and it WAS AMAZING. 

Between the other half and I, we had the poutine, onion soup, steak and fries, organic salmon and two desserts each.  Will post photos soon. 

To start, service was outstanding.  I can easily say I had the best waiter in my life! He was the kind of waiter that did it as a craft and not a job.  I even spoke to his manager to tell her how excellent our service was.  He was very attentive, informative, swift and friendly. 

Every dish was excellent except for the onion soup.  Think it was not salty enough, bitter from too much bread and missing flavor from not enough onions.  A gruyere cheese would have done the job nice but we had two sips and passed on it. 

I have eaten at restaurants in NYC during restaurant week and most of them are quite cheap in choices provided and portion.  At Tavern Gaspar, they just blew our minds by the huge portions they served even though it was prix fixe.  They are extremely generous in their portions and the quality is top, you can taste the freshness. 

If you are ever in the old part of Montreal, this place is a must.  As it is pricey, check it out during restaurant week if your pockets are tight."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, excellent service, beautiful view of the park. The wheat toast was so light and fluffy, the potatoes perfectly cooked and the omelet was superb!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice as we were staying at the hotel upstairs. Dinner was very underwhelming and breakfast was downright bad."}
{"text":"This place asthetically is pleasing which brings it up to two stars. It looks great! Nice bar, good ambience. We pribbaly had the least friendly and borderline rude bartender we've encountered though, eating and making her friends drinks while we had long standing orders in. 

We did not eat here so take that into account! The food may be another positive. Terrible service though."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful bar. I saw their design & logo on St. Paul and knew I wanted to go in. Yes they have a list of super expensive wine, and yes it's a $10 cocktail/wine kind of place. That said, it's gorgeous, has an awesome staff, and great drinks (including some beer specials). Come enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time.for me to go and I love the vibe of the place. For the occasion of happening gourmand I discover a nice place to hangout whit some friend to eat and drink well. The staff very nice and fast. The music was great and you have acces to the hotel just beside."}
{"text":"The food was actually half decent, but the service was terrible, and I say this as someone who has been a server most of my adult life. It takes me a lot to actually rant about something like this. Long waits, a complete lack of \"caring\" by the waitstaff. They pored the wrong beer twice. I have a picture of all of the employees standing around, talking and eating while the restaurant was mostly full but don't have the heart to post it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"3 stars for a acceptable meal, a bit overpriced for the quality.  Beef poutine as an appetizer ($12) came out in about 2 minutes, clearly because everything had been under a heat lamp.  Lukewarm cheese curds not very flavorful. 

A Niçoise salad was fine, done in a basic style.  Not bursting with flavor, but the green beans were fresh and snappy.  Seared scallops were fat but flavor extremes aren't what you'll find here. 

Loud and energetic noise level.  Decent beers on tap,   Despite a busy Saturday night crowd, our service was paced well.  I was glad not to be sitting on the \"terrace\" - which is just an enclosed area on the street, filled with smokers.  I don't need tourists watching me eat when I'm a tourist trying to eat."}
{"text":"So, we've had 2 meals at this little spot in Old Montreal, overlooking the Port. Yesterday, we had breakfast. It was supurb. My wife had the Breakfast skillet with duck confit. In her own words, \"It was the best breakfast I've ever had.\" I had the Apple Crepes, which was also delicious. Today, we returned for lunch. My wife had the hamburger, again in her own words, \"It was awesome!\". I had the Lobster Roll, which was good. All in all I would rate this restaurant at 4 stars. Definitely a place to go when you're in Montreal"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience ever at a restaurant. Other reviews mentioned bad service and it's true. 20 minutes to get a drink...and then the agonizing wait for food...and you wait and wait. It wasn't even busy.

Hour later no food. No updates, no excuses...nothing.

Left midway through a meal and got not even a sorry from the waiter. They know they suck so no need to make up for it.

Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great pub inside the Auberge hotel! The spiced nuts are delightful, and my husband savored every bite of their poutine.  Cool atmosphere, reasonable prices.  We also ate breakfast here every day as guests of the hotel-good options for eggs, crepes, fruit, omelets, etc."}
{"text":"Orange juice tastes like sunny delight. Great ambiance. Nice water glasses, they have some heft. Service stinks they don't really know what's going on. Strong Montrelian presence which adds to the atmosphere being excellent. 

That said, still waiting on the food and still hungry...I will be sure to continue this live review as things develop. 

No egg whites  though I ordered same."}
{"text":"Premier essaie à la Taverne Gaspar dans le cadre de l'Happening Gourmand. Je voulais découvrir leur menu brunch à 17$ comprenant un panier de viennoiseries ainsi qu'un plat au choix. Toutefois, avec mon copain nous nous sommes retrouvés à prendre une de leur option de leur menu régulier, comme le choix était plus vaste. J'ai pris l'assiette gourmande à 18$ comprenant: deux oeufs, bacon, jambon maison, saucisse, fèves au lard, creton et choix de crèpes ou pain doré. J'ai choisi le pain doré. Mon copain lui a pris l'omelette forestière à 14$ :  trois oeufs, champignons sauvages, épinards et fromage brie. Mon assiette était simple, je dirais un peu cher par rapport à la qualité des produits. J'ai été déçue par le pain doré, le pain trop mince et petit pour être savoureux et les pommes de terre rien de très impressionnantes. Les beans étaient succulentes, bien sucrées. Pour ce qui est de l'omelette, mon copain m'a dit que le goût du brie prenait trop le dessus... J'ai adoré l'ambiance de la taverne, assez sombre, intime, cela doit être génial pour un 5 à 7. Par ailleurs, le service était excellent. Notre serveuse était aux petits soins avec nous, toujours pas très loin et super souriante. Ce qui justifie mon 4 étoiles, pour moi il n'y a rien de plus important qu'un bon service cela compense une nourriture moyenne."}
{"text":"Entering the place, first thing I noticed is the architecture and interior design. Pretty nice ambiance with the massive wooden table and the great lighting.

Collins gin-based cocktail was refreshing. Mushroom ragout was quite good with the classic poached egg. Salmon tartare was delicious, fresh and mixed with crispy green apples. Steak frites was just fine, but not well cooked. We ordered it medium rare and it arrived rare.

Service was good overall. This restaurant could be an interesting option since it closes late."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but every time I go on vacation, I crave seafood. It doesn't matter if we're in the dessert or near a body of water. #WantAllTheSeafood

While visiting Montreal, I had plenty of pork and foie, but hadn't really delved into creatures from the ocean much. For a last Candadian supper, I was going big before going home.

Two glasses of rose, dozen oysters, mussels, frites and mac 'n' cheese later, we left stuffed and satisfied. Maybe with a tinge of indigestion too. 

As for the ambiance, it was a slow Sunday evening and we were one of maybe four tables seated within. Plenty of attention from our server without going overboard. It's a casual, yet chic environment. And yes, it's touristy, but I'd expect nothing less given the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I didn't totally dislike this place but wasn't overly impressed either. The prices are soso not crazy expensive but still a tad high for what you get , although given the location it may explain that part of it. They have indoor and outdoor seating which is nice (we were seated outside) it was nicely shaded for a hot summer day so it was still comfortable. Our server was friendly and did a great job making sure we had what we needed. The cocktails were my favourite part - we tried the coco lemonade cocktail and the KO cocktail both refreshing and not too sweet !  The food is where it fell short for me . I had the duck confit& apple grilled cheese with side salad. The salad was okay can't really complain the greens were fresh and the salad dressing was good and they put the perfect amount of it. My issue was that the grilled cheese had more apple than duck and it made it taste so sweet it felt like a dessert and I barely tasted any duck or even cheese. My boyfriend ordered the ribs and fries and while the portion was big and the ribs were meaty they were drenched in a very sweet sauce which was too much sweetness and entirely took over the taste of the ribs (so maybe it would have be a good idea to ask for the sauce on the side). If I would come back here it would likely be to sit outside with some cocktails and maybe an appetizer since I was pretty disappointed with the meals."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant was wonderful, with great, fast service, and amazing food. We had risotto and Tartares which were incredible and we still talk about today. This was during the fall.

This time around, we had a different experience. While the overall service is excellent as usual, we made a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday, and had to wait. We wanted a table outside and the wait line was really long. The service was very slow, over 2hours between the time we walked in and the time we left, considering we just had appetizers and one course. The drinks are still wonderful, and the food itself is still good, even if it seems to be greasier than usual. The ribs per my friends were OK, I had the duck confit panini which was good but very heavy/greasy and ended up taking half back home. 

I recommend this place as it is super well placed in the old port. Maybe during the week vs the weekend. Definitely try their cocktails as they are fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here for a second time during \"Happening Gourmand\" and found that the highlight was definitely the service.

The deal was great, 27$ for a three-course meal. I ordered the Parsnip soup with roasted cauliflower as an appetizer, the Nordic shrimp risotto with grilled asparagus as a main and the Crème Brûlée for dessert.

My boyfriend had the salad, the steak-frites and a chocolate tarte with strawberry. He also had a grapefruit cocktail which was light and refreshing.

Overall, the food was relatively meh. The soup was average, nothing special. The risotto was pretty good. I didn't know that \"nordic shrimp\" were the tiny ones which I found a bit disappointing. It came out pretty cold but the waitress took it back and when it came back out, it was steaming hot and very yummy. It is really rich and filling so I took some to go.  The dessert was good. I liked the maple flavour of the crème brûlée, which made it unique.

My partner's salad was delish. The mix of pear with the fried goat cheese and walnuts was an excellent combination. I have to admit, I may have eating half of it. Oops! He ordered the steak medium-rare but it came out rare. They apologized and fixed it up. The vegetables were underdone and the fries lacked flavour. He said the steak was really good and loved the sauce it came with. He enjoyed the dessert but I found it to be nothing special.

It was unfortunate that we didn't get to enjoy our meals at the same time because mine took a while to come out. To apologize, the waitress gave us free shots and gave us his cocktail for free. We appreciated this.

I think the highlight of this place is the service and atmosphere. Both times I've been here, I've had excellent servers. I think it is a great place for a date but also just for a drink with friends to watch the game. The menu is innovative and interesting but could be executed better.

Food: 3/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Value: 5/5 for Happening Gourmand (3.5/5 otherwise)"}
{"text":"We had A nice evening here for dinner. The service and the people are wonderful. My daughter had the ribs and they were fantastic. The lobster fritters were okay.  
My husband had the flank steak and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We were here with a group of eight. Sat outside. Service was good, beers serviceable, mussels CRAZY GOOD. Huge portion, tasty sauce, and very fresh flavor. Others were not pleased with their burgers, so I'm only rating this restaurant based on my experience."}
{"text":"Though loud with DJ'ed EDM and crowd noise, the food--especially the mussels -- made this a rewarding dining experience.  Did i mention the poutine?  Awesome. Service was fine after it took a while to get the waitress's attention on this busy Saturday night.  The in house lager and stout were very good. Notwithstanding the decibel level, the interior is quite cleverly designed."}
{"text":"If there are two things I like, they are eating and drinking. And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.

Gaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy, warm feeling, with its dim (but not too dim) interior, exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul, or through the hotel to which it is attached.

Both times I came I sat at the bar, and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening, and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done, and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh, and I had a pint of beer, which was beery good.

Second visit, Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music, drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites, which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good, though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal, believe it or not, was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there. Oh, and I had a house beer or two ($6/pint).

You can bet I'll be back (probably very soon)!"}
{"text":"Super endroit pour souper, à pas recommandé pour juste boire une bière, les drinks sont excellent surtout les bloody. À recommandée"}
{"text":"I tried Taverne Gaspar for a 5@7 one night and was pleasantly impressed! I was worried that because of the location that it would be a tourist trap, and although there were tourists enjoying the place it was far from a tourist trap. The prices are reasonable with great oyster specials (1$ per oyster between 5pm and 7pm all week). There is an all-you-can-eat fish and chips night which is a great deal because you also get a litre of the Gaspar beer on tap. The oysters were nice and fresh! The service was helpful and friendly. I like it when you ask for a suggestion and they give you a straight answer. The worst is when you ask for a suggestion and they read you the menu - I can read thank you very much! The staff was knowledgeable and professional. I will definitively be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place as we are in the restaurant. Horrible service and the food was not edible. As soon as we entered, no one cared to seat us. As we were seated, it took a waitress 10 minutes before seeing us. The waitress was rude and careless. It took a long time before we got our food and the food was not even edible. The burger was tasteless and the chicken plate didn't look presentable. The only thing I would give them a high five on  is their cocktails. The cocktails were well made. Other than that, I'm never coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place has a serious identity crisis occurring. The decor doesn't know what type of place it should be and the menu has a similar disparity. Seriously, who puts black and white photos, an electric guitar and a religious mural on a wall with southern food on the menu?! 

Weirdness aside, the food is solid and the service was stellar. I thought my Cobb salad was fine, although the chicken was a large piece and incredibly dry. My husband had the ribs which were HUGE and fall of the bone tender. The sauce had a nice heat and kick to it and the slaw was vinegary and delicious. 

Our waitress was accommodating and attentive and gave us great suggestions for drinks and other activities for our stay in Montreal. 

A solid option for food and drinks in a funky atmosphere. If it's not too hot/cold sit outside and it's a great place for people watching."}
{"text":"Gastropub eh???


   Frequented Gaspar for the Happening Gourmand thingy. We had to take a Res for 9 and even at that, the guy who took the Res didn't seem to mark it in the computer so we had the option of waiting for a table, running up a drink bill in their 'lounge' area(which I think is part of the gimmick) or eating at the bar. Jokes on you Tavern Gaspar and incompetent maitre d'...I love eating at the bar.

     I stuck with the 'Gourmand' menu because I am not in the habit of lookin' a gift horse in the mouth. The Onion soup was serious, like Judge Judy serious. Molten cheese, bone marrow, beautifully caramelized onions...it is a meal in itself. No seriously, I ate like a third of it or I wouldn't have had room for my 'Tavern Burger'. In retrospect I should have finished the soup.

   The burger came....and went. They were really busy so I am thinking the grill man got ahead of himself. When the burger finally came, it was fairly apparent it had been sitting on the pass for a little while....hot on top and lukewarm in the middle.

   Allow me to say this, I don't send food back. When I go out to eat, as a cook myself and someone who has an unrelenting pursuit of perfection, a restaurant has one chance to get it right. If I send something back, I don't want another one. You've ruined my meal and I am not paying...it is kinda cut throat but I hold myself to the same standard...that is all I've got.

   That being said, the burger was almost a send back. The burger was lukewarm and the piece of 'pork belly'(call it pork belly when you braise it, when it is on a burger it is called 'bacon' motherfuckers) had a very 'Birkenstockish' texture...but the onion rings were pretty good. My girlfriend had the roasted salmon on a bed of lentils which were both cooked to absolute perfection. Finally, the gateaux chomeur was very 'classic Quebec' and tasty...the flan...meh.

   All and all, a middle of the road experience. The old fashioned I started with was great, our bartender was pleasant and the gourmand deal was OK but I wouldn't go back otherwise. Personally, callin' this place a Gastropub is like putting lipstick on  pig...another Quebec past time.

Waka Waka"}
{"text":"As gastropubs go..a very solid choice witha great summer patio that is stroller friendly!  Had the homemade chips n dip and were surprisingly satisfied.. for $7 We thought theybwere going to be delish and they did not disappoint.  Beet burger and salad were very filling and had a slight curry flavour.  A little soft in texture but made up for it in flavour.  A nice lunch spot in old Montreal"}
{"text":"Nice pub and good ambiance.

Food was good & the location is nice. Service was just OK, i won't mind giving it another try."}
{"text":"Service is so-so, food was very average. My coleslaw was frozen, bland, and oily, I guess that made it somewhat original. Not the best place in the area."}
{"text":"Hier soir, je suis allée faire la découverte de la toute nouvelle Tarvene Gapsar avec mon copain. Ce resto-pub viens tout juste d'ouvrir donc j'étais curieuse d'essayer le nouvel endroit qui, heureusement, dit \"Bienvenue aux dames\".

J'avais fait des réservations par le Web via leur site et j'ai été bien contente de la faciliter de choisir mon heure, le nombre de personne et de confirmer le tout avec seulement quelques petits clics. Quand nous sommes arrivé, notre réservation s'était bien rendue et on nous a vite présenter notre table. L'endroit où l'on était assit, en arrière juste à côté du bar, était un peu étrange, mais plus la soirée avançait, plus j'aimais notre p'tit coin qui me permettait d'observer les gens au bar et la majorité du resto. Pour mon copain, de seulement voir un bout de mur était un peu moins plaisant.

Pour le repas, on a commencé par se partager deux entrées : les chips avec huile de truffes et le « pop-corn » au veau. On a bien aimé les deux mais je dois avouer que pour le prix j'ai été un peu déçue des proportions. Je sais, je sais, dans le Vieux tout coûte un peu plus cher, mais c'était quand même petit. Ensuite, on s'est séparé le fish n' chips et le burger. Le poisson était cuit parfaitement et se défaisait avec une fourchette seulement et le burger fait définitivement parti de mon top 5 des meilleurs burgers en ville. Un peu comme les entrés, c'est un peu cher mais dans les prix que je m'attendait pour le style de resto et l'emplacement et pour les repas principaux, les proportions sont parfaites. On était assez plein une fois nos repas terminés qu'on n'a pas demandé de dessert.

À y retourner, je pense que j'aimerais mieux m'installer au bar avec une bière ou un cocktail pour partager des petites bouchées. L'ambiance était très bien et j'ai aimé la sélection de musique. J'ai bien hâte de voir ce que les autres en penseront."}
{"text":"Slow service, bad food, and the girls keep chatting with each other. 10 minutes to get a beer and 10 minutes waiting for the check 
Don't go to this place."}
{"text":"Vraiment deçue de notre soirée. Une table de trois sur la terasse, un mardi soir. Notre premier verre d'alcool est arrivé après plus de 30 minutes. Une entrée d'huitres et d'olives marinées en a pris 1 heure. Les huitres encore attachées par le nerf... Nous avons fini par sortir de l'endroit après une attente totale de 4 heures. Je considère l'offre d'un shooter pour s'excuser. Nourriture bonne tout de meme. Je pense seulement que le service doit etre revisé. 
Merci"}
{"text":"Came here with the kids and sat outside.  Very good service.  The kids had crepes, actually they split a crepe since it was so big. Also had the moules frittes, which came in a very delicious sauce.  Comes off as a little touristy and more of a bar, but would recommend."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. We were seated immediately, but then waited 20 minutes to order, and then another hour and 15 minutes, and our food never came! They just kept shrugging and avoiding us. Drinks were meh. Worse, the manager never appeared, and there was no attempt to make things right for us. We ended up leaving without eating. Read the other reviews carefully... this place has a real problem with their service."}
{"text":"The start of the new year also means the start of Happening Gourmand in the old port. This food \"festival\" brings together all the restaurants of the Antonopoulos Group and provides a special reduced price table d'hôte at each of their 8 restaurants. Events like these are enjoyable for me simply because it allows me to try Old Port restaurants without costing me my arm and perhaps a leg to enjoy. Ironically this year, I wasn't a driving force amongst my friends to participate as is usually the case... two separate friends set up two reservations and invited me! I guess this is a sign of the event gaining a foothold in people's consciousness. Either way, I won't turn down a good meal so away I went. The first of the two dinners was at Taverne Gaspar - the Group's Gastropup located on de la Commune with a view of the Saint-Lawrence.

Visually, Taverne Gaspar attempts to blend the pub or tavern look with elements of the old Montreal building it is located in - a nice long wooden bar with wooden seats, leather banquettes and chairs, tile flooring and roofing, low lighting with the exception of the christmas lights set up along the center of the room. That choice along with the use of dark tones elsewhere to put emphasis on the old stone walls creates a very relaxed old world kind of feel. The night we were there the entire street actually lost power so at one point for a bit, the lighting was almost completely candlelight so that intimate feel was cranked up further! Thankfully the lost power didn't affect our meal...

Now, as for the food, the menu is definitely gastropub fare with touches of more local influences. As a group of 3, we each picked something different in order to try as much as we could. First up, a classic onion soup - a hardy and meaty broth with good quantity of onions nicely caramelized topped with gooey cheese and a crouton. Well very executed and enjoyable.

I also had some fresh oysters because I'm a sucker of oysters so if they're on the menu, it's hard for me to resist. Paired with a nice mignonette, there were great.

Next, we had the lobster sliders with house chips. Firstly, when the menu says sliders, we would have expected more than one but no... just one. Thankfully it was pretty flavourful although I would have prefer more lobster versus mayo. The house chips were nicely seasoned with a good crunch. The salad felt like it was there to make the dish seem larger. A solid dish flavour-wise but disappointing in terms of portion - especially when this was a dish where they charged extra for it within the table d'hôte.

The last starter was their beef poutine with cheese curds and cipollini sauce. In my eyes, this was the best of the bunch. The beef was rich and fall apart in texture and in combination with the cipollini sauce, gave the poutine a much hefty feel than your standard poutine. Add solid fries and the correct cheese curds - melt just a bit but still keep its texture and squeak - and we have a great starter.

Moving on the mains, the first one was their beef bourguignon. Once again great texture to the beef - chewy but fall apart. Carrots and potatoes cooked nicely as well but that reduced sauce was really the key here. Brought everything together and really made the dish nice and hearty - exactly what one seeks in a beef bourguignon.

Next was the mac n'cheese with cheddar and smoked lardons. Baked off nicely in a onion soup dish, the cheddar brought some sharpness to the creamy gooeyness that is mac n'cheese and of course the fattiness of the lardons was well appreciated. A solid dish.

The last main was the Gaspar BBQ burger with their house fries - another dish where they charged extra for but thankfully in this case it was worth it. Portion-wise this was by far the biggest and enjoyable across the board. More of the house fries plus a side of coleslaw to go with the burger. The beef patty was cooked perfectly topped with some melted cheese, bacon and slaw. A little spicy mayo was provided to go with the fries as well. Another solid dish to round off the second course.

Finally, we had the desserts. The table d'hôte provided two options - chantilly brownies and a bumble berry cheesecake. The brownies were decadent and very chocolatey. The chantilly cream provided a nice counterbalance to that. The cheesecake was nice as well - the right level of creaminess without being too rich. Solid way to end our meal.

Overall, Taverne Gaspar was a solid and well executed meal pretty much across the board. I'm not a big fan of how they charge extra on certain dishes within the table d'hote especially when they are some of the more appealing options there but I suppose it was just up to us to not order them. I like the vibe of the setting and the quality of the food on the menu. If one is seeking a worthwhile gastropub in Old Montreal, Gaspar is worth your consideration.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Every year for our respective birthdays, Danny and I have to pick a restaurant for the other to treat us to. This year I wanted to try something new, and enlisted the help of Yelp and some friends to find the perfect place. After looking at menus and consulting all recommendations given by friends, I settled on Taverne Gaspar because it combines three things I love - food and beer in a pub atmosphere. I made reservations for a Friday night at 7pm, and were seated promptly upon arrival. This place finds itself in Old Montreal and is very quaint. It is minimalist and offers a laid-back feel. Our server, Eric, was super nice and was very knowledgeable on the specials and beer/food selection. Danny and I each started off with the beer dégustation (5oz each of a dark ale, cream ale, white ale and blonde ale), which ended up being the perfect choice as I had been undecided on what beer to choose. Being Oktoberfest, we were suggested fresh pretzels as appetizers, which we both had. They were fresh and so good with the marinara sauce. For our actual meals, I had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries, and Danny had the Steak Frites. My burger was so tasty, flavourful and not so ginormous that I couldn't finish the rest of my meal. The BBQ sauce on it was just perfect, and the sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Danny enjoyed his steak and finished up my sweet potato fries as well (sign of a good meal!). At the end of the meal, I was surprised with a birthday dessert, a chocolate molten lava cake with fresh raspberries. It was the perfect end to a delicious meal. Definitely recommend others give it a try!"}
{"text":"I went to Taverne Gaspar during the Happening Gourmand back in January.  I understand it might not be the best moment to judge a restaurant as the menu is fixed and the clientèle increases significantly because of the low price for a fixed menu but still, it is also their opportunity to shine and to gain loyal customers.  

First off, I must say this restaurant makes itself very discreet.  We literally passed in front of it three times before noticing it! As you go in, the walls are in brick and the feeling you get of the place is more of a relaxed pub for a happy hour after a long day at work. As for food, there was some interesting choices! I chose the onion soup with bone marrow; the soup itself was very sweet and they were not too generous on the bone marrow, only a small bit on the top of the cheese. Then I went ahead with the Tavern burger with manchego cheese, pork belly and onion rings.  The pork belly was much more like a slice of bacon and again they are not very generous in portion.  The burger was small and they included four onion rings.  I have to say that although there was not a lot of them, the rings were crispy and flavorful. Finally, a dark chocolate flan was included in the menu along with creme anglaise.  A flan in my dictionary is a custard-like dessert. It seems that according to them, it was a brownie! The brownie itself was powdery and not too visually appealing.

Again, I will give them a second chance as I went during an event and they have not been opened for that long.  The service on the other hand was absolutely flawless!"}
