{"text":"Awesome food and great service the chicken manchurian is probably the best dish they have. These guys also have a great variety of soups and vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"Bad food. Noodles were undergone and soggy. The chilli chicken was stringy and overfried. For the price you can get much better value anywhere else. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"I wish i could have this food without ever having to come in to this restaurant. I seriously dread having to come here but my love of Hakka style asian food keeps bringing me back. Why the dread? For one thing, the service is really, really lacking. The people who work here almost seem upset that they have to deal with you; frustrated with the notion that you being there is making them have to work and do their job. I guess what really gets their blood boiling is the fact that, above all else, you want to give them your hard-earned money (ok, that's probably the only thing they are looking forward to). If you are looking to dine in, expect to spend 10-15 minutes waiting for food so allocate your lunch break accordingly (might want to call in earlier and make an order). Once you get the food though, you can expect it to be rather good.  I seriously don't get this place, it has so much potential. If they put any effort into their service and ensuring people walk away pleased, they would be much busier at lunch on a weekday in an area that is lacking quality asian joints."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The manchurian soup is a must have! One of the very few Indo-Chinese restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Taketomi Village Japanese Restaurant was pretty decent, WHEN it was a Japanese Restaurant. Unfortunately, Taketomi is no longer a Japanese Restaurant, they switched to Chinese Food. Before the initial change was made, Taketomi was one of more unique sushi restaurants. Located in the NE, they offered an AYCE menu and a standard menu. They followed the usual AYCE rules, but the proportions are fairly large. I have witnessed several complains about the fried rice on the AYCE menu and noticed that their sashimi was very bland and tasteless. However they did serve Krokettes on their AYCE which is always a blessing. At the end of the day, Taketomi is no longer a Sushi Restaurant. Maybe they'll have more luck serving Chinese Food than Sushi."}
{"text":"Food is what makes us keep coming back. Unless we are in the NE with family or a Bollywood movie night, takeout is what works for us. Most times they have one server managing both in house guests along with takeout which can become a bit of an inconvenience. We now go in expecting it and the food is what draws us back so tend to overlook the rest.  For the past two years, the usual for us has always been a combination of Hot n sour or chicken corn soup and manchurian or Szechuan chicken with Szechuan rice.  They have consistently made the food as we like it.  Go for the food, forget the rest and you'll be satisfied.  P.S. Each serving has very generous portions"}
{"text":"Awesome food! We always get the Manchurian veggie balls, veggie chow mien and hot and sour soup. Delicious!!! Portion size is perfect too - with usually left over for take home.   Must for every fan of Indian Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"I dine for lunch here on a semi-regular basis and have always enjoyed the food. The food is very unique, Indian-Hakka, which one should consider as a recognized form of asian fusion. I always come with an Indian friend who orders, unfortunately I cannot comment on specific dishes, I can only say I have enjoyed every one I have tasted.   The inside is interesting, does not look like the web page. As soon as I walked in I thought, hmmm, this would be a good candidate if Restaurant Makeover did an episode in Calgary."}
{"text":"What the heck is this place?  If you're previously TakeTomi Village, probably a good idea to take that off your sign.   This is what it says on their website: Taketomi Village Restaurant - HAKKA INDIAN CHINESE (previously a Japanese restaurant) is the fusion of Indian and Chinese food. If Chinese is what you crave with hot Indian spices, then that is what you can order.  I was also told by a taxi driver that this place had the best chinese soup ever. I had to try it out.  We walk in and instantly we were confused by the setting. It definitely looked like a japanese restaurant and it was a bit trippy with all the red lighting and red lanterns. It was busy in there! Must be good right? We were taken to a table as soon as we walked in.  We take a look at the menu and it has a pretty standard menu of chinese dishes but not authentic chinese dishes.   OKAY so we decide to order the Curry Chicken... We ask if the curry chicken is good? Our waitress says \"No one ever orders the Curry chicken here so i don't know\".   US: ok so what is in the curry chicken?  Waitress: I don't know.... let me ask the kitchen.   US: Well what dishes are good to recommend?   Waitress: Um i don't know...   US: Ok maybe this waitress doesn't know what she's doing or she can't speak english too well? Let's flag down another waitress.   *Flags down another waitress* US: Um so do you know what is in the chinese chicken?   Other waitress: UM sorry i don't know. *starts giggling and run off*  By this time we are completely horrified about our decision to come here and want to flee right away. However we wait out for the food because we figure there's so many people it must be good right?  Wrong. The food was bad. The soup we ordered (corn and chicken soup, hot and sour seafood soup) was less than mediocre.  The mapou tofu and the curry chicken was gross and the sauce was watery.  The service is terrible because the waitresses don't know anything about their own restaurant dishes. They also didn't have the capacity to suggest popular dishes which is sad for newcomers.   Even as we were leaving with bad taste in our mouth, people were piling in the door.  If you want my opinion this place has chinese food catered to indian people. The bulk of the people coming in were Indian and clearly they liked it."}
{"text":"1. Bad service (waitress didn't write down my order even after I told her 3 times and she dismissed me each time) 2. Disgusting decor. All outdated furnishings and in a bad condition. 3. Most importantly, unsanitary. Waitress wiped our dirty table in front of us with a dry napkin. It looks as if the place has never been cleaned."}
{"text":"Chicken pokaras!!!  just go for chicken pakoras. If you like the idea of Indian cusine meets  Chinese cuisine this might be the place for you :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this resturant.  But both times that we visited the resturant we have not been impressed.  Why did we want to try it out?  It was in John Gilchrist's cheap eats book.The first time we visited, there was no one there so we just backed out.  The second time it was earlier and there was one other couple.  We ordered a few dishes.. trying to get recommendations was like trying to pull teeth.  The beef tasted mmm old ?  Our two dishes were definitely poor.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was half decent. Ordered Chilli chicken and Garlic chicken. They gave us same chicken just one with extra chilli added to it. Washrooms needs more cleaning and the lighting was dull in this place. Portions are good but food needs to have more flavours. Order took quite a while before it came on our table. Servers needs to be more friendly as I kept calling them and after three times she replied. Until we went back home later that night, had upset my husbands stomach and next day my stomach."}
{"text":"The day Calgary gets another hakka chinese place, I will be screaming in joy from my rooftop and thanking God for blessing us Muslim Calgarians!  Seriously can someone PLEASE open a halal hakka chinese restaurant that is ACTUALLY good????? It's about time. I've been coming to Taketomi since its inception. The only reason everyone goes here is because its the only halal chinese establishment.There is such a high demand for hakka, and why after all these years we still don't have more places to eat halal Chinese is just beyond me. In comparison, there are some superb hakka places in Vancouver and Toronto.   The worst part is that the customer service is just disgraceful. Some of the employees are actually really rude. I literally have to force myself, out of sheer politeness, to even consider giving tipping here. And would it kill them to play some damn music?!?!  Save yourself from disappointment and cook hakka Chinese in your own kitchen instead."}
{"text":"I ordered for a chicken fried rice(Takeout) at 11:30pm, 30 minutes before closing time. At 11:45pm, I left the restaurant with parcel. Opened it and was surprised to find Garlic Beef. I tried calling back the restaurant to explain that I don't eat beef, they they didn't pick up. So the next day I took the wrong dish back for a cash-back. They said they cant accept it back in a rude way and said they dont want to waste time explaining me. Such WORST customer service! Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Oh yeah!! Finally I fell in love with asian food in calgary just because of this restaurant. The name says Hakka and Indian cuisine. Felt like trying it. As soon as we stepped in, oh no!!! all the tables were full. And there were already 2 families waiting for their table. The smell from the food, made us wait patiently as we felt like not to go back without trying the food. Good thing was that it was open till late hours in the night.  So always a better option when we are late for dinner.  And the prices were also reasonable but when we see the quantity they serve per dish, it seemed like pretty cheaper price. Moreover there was no compromise on the taste. Even with a taste of few spoons of  the items, tasted sooo delicious. Trust me,even though the food was so tasty, though we ordered 3 dishes for 3 people, we were unable to finish them. So order one item lesser than you think and decide if you still want to go for the left out one after eating the ordered dishes.  DON'T MISS the appetizers. Chicken , shrimp , fish pakora. We ordered Shrimp pakora and it was so spicy which made our day. Also they serve some sauce with it. The best dish in this restaurant that I wouldn't ever forget. Though the serving staff was less, the service was pretty quick.  They do have combos for 2 , 3 and groups. For sure I am going back to this place to try more items. Can't wait to try again !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place best indo chinese ever! Got to try :) Fast delicous food, some waiters are nice."}
{"text":"Most people who posted bad reviews on here don't know what they're talking about. Perhaps they want bland food with polished service but for me as a Toronto transplant to Calgary, this place is great. Could The service be improved? Yes but that's not why I came to this eatery. I was craving \"Hakka\" food and that's what I got. I knew most Calgarians were philistines when it came to food but had no idea it was this bad! Calgary - please continue to pan good restaurants like these and maybe you'll get a Panda Express so you can be happy with bland food for western tastes. Also what's with the poor urban planning here? I've never ever seen a city so spread out with traffic lights so ill-timed and close together, not to mention the crater-sized potholes"}
{"text":"This place has an extensive menu.  The food was tasty and it was served fast.  The chunks of chicken in the chicken dishes were huge unlike other hakka restaurants.  I recommend the peking duck. Its like a toned down sweet and sour.  I dont recommend the manchurian fried rice or cantonese lo mein. It was tasteless.  Prices are pretty much standard for a  hakka restaurant.    They have some cool booth seating for about 6 people. The lighting is a bit dim.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Trying to look for a quick fix for Chinese food and I heard this place was decent so I decided to check it out. Man was I mistaken. I wanted to order their lunch special to go but they don't allow it to go which is fine with me. When I was all ready to order the waiter comes out and tells me lunch is over and still not a bother. Then I wanted to order a seafood chowmein and the dude didn't even know what was in it so I'm like whatever I'll get it and he comes back from the kitchen and tells me they're all out of chowmein noodles. At this point I'm just starved so I get the Szechuan Beef Noodles to go. I get back to work and in my box is what I call \"Asian spaghetti noodles\" with oil, sriracha and old beef & veggies. I wouldn't eat there again even if it was free."}
{"text":"this restaurant is closed, added something to its name. i didnt like it at all. i think its a mix of japanese and middle east food now."}
