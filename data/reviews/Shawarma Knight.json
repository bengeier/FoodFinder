{"text":"This is my favourite falafel place in Calgary. Staff is super friendly, prices are fair, service is usually pretty fast and they're open late on weekends. 

Their tabouleh (salad made with tomatoes, onion, lots of parsley and olive oil) and deserts (especially the baklava) are also worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love LOVE the chicken shawarmas at this place.  I love Jimmys A+A too, but I love how this place wraps up the shawarma into a neat wrap so that it isn't spilling out all over the place.  The fresh ingredients and sauces are great.  The owners are always nice, and the place seems to be open at all hours."}
{"text":"This is our go to place after the bar on the weekends. Open till 4am and always delicious. The staff can get a bit a rude late at night but I don't blame them... I wouldn't want to deal with drunk people either. I usually get the large Trio which is very filling. There lamb meat is the best seasoned lamb I have ever had. I definitely recommend Shawarma Knights! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean market and halal meat shop may be short on pantry items - they've got more hookah pipes than anything - but they're long on affordable and tasty Mediterranean fast food eats.  The king lording over the menu is the ever-popular shawarma - slow grilled meats stuffed in a Mediterranean pita with vegetables and a tasty garlic sauce.  I always get extra sauce on my chicken shawarma cuz it really ties the whole thing together.  It's a bit spicy, a bit sweet, it's crunchy, and it's a great alternative to a standard burger.  This place offers dine in, take out, and they even deliver when you're feeling really lazy."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma I've ever had. The option to mix meats is a dream come true - chicken and lamb is where it's at! 

The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend everyone check Shawarma Knight out immediately!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for some late night falafel, and Shawarma Knight is down the way from my boyfriend's. I've always been a little sketched out by the restaurants on this strip of 14th, but we walked into a busy and clean restaurant. The falafel we had was made fresh while we waited and the service was excellent. Super friendly young man who made our food chatted with us, asking is how our weekend was going. 
Getting back to the falafel, as stuffed as I was, I couldn't help wanting to go back for seconds. It tasted so delicious. Just a hint of fennel and perfectly crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. None of that dried, fossilized stuff some places have sitting in the fridge until you come by and take it out of its misery. 
Will be making this my new place when I'm lazy, but want to eat somewhat healthily."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town. They have great food and great service. Huge servings. They are open late night."}
{"text":"Hands down best shawarma in the city. Great friendly staff. Open late and perfect for after clubbing grub (that's exactly what we did ). Try the mixed shawarma wrap."}
{"text":"This is just a fun place to grab a good shawarma.  They chop the chicken shawarma a little finer than I'd like, but just ask them not to (if you like your chicken chunks a bit bigger).  But all else is fantastic, even the rice is tastier than normal. The beef shawarma is great too!  

And the guys here have to be some of the friendliest fellows in the already very friendly city of Calgary."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here! I'll need to double check that what I order is gluten free next time, but that's on me so that's not a reflection on them at all, my only suggestion would be for them to clearly mark why is and is not GF friendly. 

Staff was great and food was fast, super recommended!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is AMAZING.  On Fridays and Saturdays, they opened till 4am. BIG BONUS when you're in the area and craving for something zesty.  Their chicken shawarma plate, I dont know what it is but it's like crack.  The hummus is right, the sweet sauce is out of this world, the pilaf is perfectly cooked, and top it off with their RIDICULOUSLY addictive garlic sauce, you can pretty much guarantee yourself a fantastic meal here.  BF LOVED the donair, they always do it right.  I personally prefer this over Jimmy's because well, it just tastes better here.   Pop in and out for some amazing arabic food and you won't be sorry you did. I am in Calgary once a month, and when I am not in Calgary, I count down the days that I will get to shove my face in their shawarma plate.  No, I am not related to the business or restaurant in anyway giving this raving review, I am just a BIG fan from California, who wish there was something CLOSE to Shawarma Knight in the sunny state."}
{"text":"Great taste, great staff. we usually order platters and it taste just great. Their chef must be awesome."}
{"text":"Easily the best in Calgary. I love shawarma and have been to many places in Calgary but nothing ever hits the spot like shawarma knights. Plus open late. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Of course we have been back again (it may be at least once a week that we go back), but this was the first time we stopped in late night for food on the way home. It was packed in their. Also watching the guys who work there keep calm cool and collected while dealing with all the bar stars makes me rate their service even higher. You guys are up to 5-stars in my books! 

Overheard the guy in line behind us say that his cab driver had dropped him there saying it was the best shawarma around. He really hoped it was. We told him that he would be impressed.

This visit instead of their delightful lamb, I tried the donair meat in my shawarma. This was a great choice! Their donair has a great flavour and still is a little moist. Nice surprise.

We also go 2x falafal to try and it is as good as expected. Not too overly flavored and the outside was a perfect crisp. Little tahini sauce and away you go.

But the best part of this visit was finally trying their fried potatoes. These are 1/4 pieces of potato cooked just right with a fantastic spice on the outside for flavour. It is then covered in a pile of garlic sauce that is thick and creamy. It was unreal good. 

Our biggest challenge moving forward will be trying not to order the potatoes every time."}
{"text":"No complaints, loved it here, 5 stars. Ran in last night for the first time for an eat-in experience and cure the craving we were having for a chicken shawarma. We made it in just before the after-bar crowd came swarming in.
The guys working were really friendly and made us some great food! REALLY enjoyed it! Fresh veg, fantastic chicken, soft pitas, delicious sauces. They really pack it in together so it does not all fall out and make for a messy experience.
Will return and recommend. I would love to try everything they make!"}
{"text":"On the downside of 2.5 because the lamb sharwarma platter was not that good overall, and yet they advertise themselves as the best Arabic food in Calgary. Unless you count the halal raspberry soda non-alcoholic beer, hardly.

Where to start...
The lamb bits were dry and overcooked, and almost tasteless; they shouldn't be serving this meat to paying customers. A dog wouldn't, however, have known the difference. 
The pita bread was cold and somewhat dried out.
The cold vegetables and condiments were not as strongly-flavoured as they should have been; the garlic was more creamy than piquant; the hot sauce not that all hot or intriguing, the hummus bland and boring, and the other bits added little to the meal.
The rice was only average nice.
The potatoes in a dark gravy tasted better, but were still undercooked at 2pm, and hence only the tomato-based gravy carried some flavour forward.
A nice-sized portion for the $15 meal didn't make up for the deficits.
Overall, just kinda blah.

The younger woman was very pleasant, and the older man, likely the owner, perhaps had tried to steer me to the fresher-looking chicken shawarma, or the big newly-rolled donair, but I'd read here that the lamb was wonderful! Not sure how this is: anything that is rated by others as 'so delicious' should be delicious to almost everyone, shouldn't it? Even the aftertaste was almost disagreeable.

The place was clean but well-worn and somewhat 'irish pennant' looking, and empty. The nearly-silent TV on the wall in the dining area lent a lonely aspect to the place.

For me an overall of 2.5 stars seems almost charitable..."}
{"text":"My first shawarma since I moved back to Calgary.

i ordered a large chicken shawarma so my pita was further wrapped with a triangular piece of markouk bread. It was loaded with the usual stuff - chicken, hummus, garlic sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, beets, banana peppers, tabouli, tahini & hot sauce. Once wrapped, the whole works was toasted a bit, delivering a nice crispy exterior.

I would have preferred my chicken to be carved to order from the cone and then heated in the frying pan so it was a little warmer. The frying pan didn't get the pre-cut chicken as hot as I would have liked it. 

Other than that minor issue I thought it was a really solid shawarma and definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Best shwarma I've ever had, and there is this one guy who is always there and always smiling which makes such a difference. I always get the platter with tons of delicious meat and potatoes with hummus, so good! I only used to eat this food after the pub, but now I crave it even when I am sober."}
{"text":"I love their shawarmas... delicious, simple clean sauces, tender beef slices and crunchy vegetables. Love the twice wrapped and grilled style. Wish they would put a bit more meat, though that's just me being greedy. Filling is more than adequate. The platters are awesome as well - the garlicky sauce they put on the roasted potatoes and rice is deadly. Beware - you will be burping up garlic all day."}
{"text":"Good donair and great flavor! Not that good fries. It doesn't smell eother which is good."}
{"text":"Go hungry and get the mixed shawarma platter, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 4 because its a combined experience.  The food really is a 4/5 but hte service was lacking due to a mixup on my order, the head didnt know what the tail was doing.  The falafels are fresh but bland! 2nd place in the city that i know of.  Just lacking in flavours and spices of jerusalem like jerusalem swarma by my place in the north suburbs.  THe platters were quite good, only thing is beef+lamb is th eonly choice?  why no beef swarama alone?  thats all you can have chicken/lamb&beef etc, and they charge same prices for lamb&beef as for just lamb? 12$ for lamb 10$ for beef, even mixed says 11$, but they charge 12$ for mixed.  prices are not represented properly in the menu.  THe lamb&beef definitly has that lamb barnyard taste.  The falafels are fresh and the sauces are nice.  The vegetables had good spice."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this place on Saturday night after a few too many bevies! I didn't even know what a \"Shawarma\" was until this night! I have since been back three times!! Holy YUMMM!!

It's an average, strip mall, type joint with the most delicious food!! They are open super late and the guys working are a tone of fun! I have been in the middle of the day and the middle of the night and I'm totally in love. I'll be back a million times over!

And you can make it kinda healthy! Perfect!!"}
{"text":"Drunk or sober, a great place for a solid donair.  The owners are amazing, food is great and they just renno'ed."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma wrap, falafel wrap and the donair wrap are all amazing. So glad to have this place open so late at night. It's my go-to spot after a few beers!"}
{"text":"My current Calgary classic for shawarmas. They wrap theirs in saj bread, adding an extra layer of decadence. Get a lamb/chicken mix; the lamb with its tasty spice mix combined with the juicy chicken for a you-can't-stop taste sensation. Friendly service, and a steady line of customers keep the place hopping at all hours."}
{"text":"It's a very ideal and pleasing place for a family. Very tasty shawarma and veggies. Nice service and equally well mannered. Me and my family enjoyed it. Thank you. Keep up the work"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite to eat last night and I'm really glad I did! I had the mixed shwarma (chicken and donair) with all the fixings. I find I normally get to the bottom of the pita and it's too hard to eat and soggy to finish, but I ate every last bite of this one. A regular was plenty big enough for me! 

I also tried the falafel, which they make fresh, definitely the best I've had in the city. Moist and tasty but crispy on the outside. The garlic sauce is delicious on these. The baklava wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was tasty and crispy with a nice amount of honey. 

The service was fab - friendly, fast and helpful. I took his recommendation on both the shwarma and the sauce to have with the falafel. 

I just moved to this area and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best falafel I've had in Calgary!! There was not a little crumb in sight when I cut into them - that's how not-dry they were. The outside was crisp but the inside was soft and almost creamy. The potatoes with garlic sauce were pretty good, although I have had better. My brother said his wrap was good as well and did not disintegrate as many wraps are wont to do. 

One of the guys behind the counter also taught me the difference between donair and shawarma. Donair is the giant meat stick on the right hand side that looks homogeneous while shawarma are the three meat sticks on the left hand side that look like little pieces of meat forced together. It might be the other way around actually... Oh well, it just means I'll have to come back!"}
{"text":"Following the Yelp Elite event last night, which lacked vegan food so hard, my friend and I decided to hunt down some Falafel. We ended up back around my neighbourhood when I remembered there was a Shawarma place that is always open at like 2 am whenever I'm coming home on the weekends. 
I have to admit, that had we not been starving and The Coup not been closed, I may not have initially chosen this establishment. It is very modest inside. We stood trying to decide what we had, when one of the staff told us we HAD to have the Falafel because they make it to order, and it is the best in the city. 
We watched as the gentleman scooped up the chickpea goodness and placed it into the deep fryer. I ordered almost everything vegan on my wrap except for tomatoes because I am a horrible Italian. It was wrapped not once, but twice. Just how I like it. This was just what my starving, drunken stomach needed, and had I no self control I probably would have eaten a thousand of them. 
I am still a big fan of Cedar's Deli as well as Pita Grill, but I will say that this is definitely the best Falafel I have had downtown or in the 17th Avenue area. You should try it."}
{"text":"Located close to 17th Ave and 14th street. Great service, very cheerful server and owner. Just about $10 for a large chicken shawarma. Lots of veggies and very filling. Good place for a quick shawarma and the place has free parking right behind the store."}
{"text":"I came here everyday for two weeks and most times I would get the lamb plate because it is just SO DELICIOUS and I would crave it all the time! The potatoes with garlic sauce are so good, the hummus is creamy, and the lamb shawarma oh my goodness it is the best thing I've ever had. 

Chicken shawarma is delicious...but that lamb is a whole n'other level; a mix of gamey and tender. On top of that they drown your plate with garlic sauce, hot sauce, and this very interesting sweet sauce (I don't remember the name...'Armenian sweet sauce' maybe) which completes the whole meal. Thinking about that sauce drizzled on top of the lamb shawarma is making me so hungry right now. And I don't know where else serves this sauce/lamb shawarma. 

Also their falafels are handmade and fried on the spot and is not dry at all. I don't normally like falafel (since all the ones I've had before were dry and generally sucked)...but shawarma knight has changed my mind. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"It truly pains me to write this review as I used to be a HUGE fan of Shawarma Knight.  They were a regular stop every other Friday night after an evening of debauchery.  My large beef wrap + a beef samosa + 2 falafel balls was almost a ritual for me over the past five years.  Dunno what happened but over the past six months its been a downhill slide for both the quality of food and service.

First the food.  While their food isn't bad (still quite tasty) its no where near as good as it once was.  A few times they've been out of staple fixings (i.e. onions or those funky pickled beets or cabbage (dunno what it is, I've heard them called both)), seriously what donar shop runs out of that?  The samosas had kind of a furry (don't know how else to describe it) texture the last time I was there.  

Now the service.  Used to love going here because the staff were just so damned happy.  Was cool to see people having fun at their job and seemingly enjoying what they're doing.  For the past six months every time I've gone in and ordered they're all cranky.

Will mix my shawarma intake between these guys, Jimmy's and Shawarma King and see who comes out on top."}
{"text":"This is was the most bland disgusting dry chicken and rice on a platter I've ever had. To top it off it was served with plain lettuce and dried up shredded carrots. No turnips no onions no parsley just dry bland chicken and bland rice with some garlic mayo. Never again."}
{"text":"Ever since my most recent health scare, I've kind of come to the conclusion that a chicken schwarma is probably one of the best snack foods / meals out there.  A simple healthy pita (better if whole wheat), broiled chicken breast meat on a spit, a fair amount of veggies and a bit of sauce, all wrapped together into a tight little pita wrap that can be eaten pretty much anywhere.  Add the fact that it seems to be the food of champions after an invasion by a Norse God and his unholy alien army of Earth conqureing aliens, and it's pretty much a darn good meal overall.

Ever since, I've honestly have had Schwarma maybe 2-3 times a week for lunch.  Bring next door to Sammy's, a few blocks from Tarboosh and with Cedar's deli close to my gal's workplace, I've tried probably a 1/2 dozen places in the city.  But one place I keep forgetting to explore are the ones literally a hop skip jump and 10 min walk away, Ali Baba and Shwarma Knight.  So with that in mind, and a bunch of Yelp reviews from fellow yelpers Christine L. and Sarah Louise F., I decided to mosey on down and take a gander (plus have a late lunch).

Now of course, every place has it's own take on the Shwarma.  Sammy's tends to seriously salt their meat (sometimes a little too much). Cedar's really loads up on the veggies.  Little Lebanon has a good balance of both, but adds a little too much sauce sometimes making eating a little too messy.  Tarboosh is a decent one overall with a good balance, but nothing too special.  Shawarma Knight's claim to pita fame seems to be a nice little touch of a second thin pita on top of their normal pita to prevent any mess, and to really load on the meat.

Now how was it?  I would say it's good, but not a knock out of the park.  I found my chicken to be ok, but with not much seasoning at all and even a little leathery in some pieces.  I was a little disappointed they only had white pita bread and not brown, but still it was ok.  Veggies are veggies, and so long as they're not spoiled or old, it's aok with me.  But for $9 for a large pita, it was admittedly quite huge.  

Would I go back there?  Yes I would, but probably more for a late night snack, since most of my fav places are closed after 7 (Cedar's and Little Lebanon).  For a late night snack after clubbing, especially with the late hours, I can see why this is such a popular place.  It's a good place for a nosh, and I really should try some of the other menu selections.  

Btw, my gal has commented on my recent Shwarma binge by saying, \"You won't get super powers you know.\"  Maybe not, but for a source of protein and muscle building... it's pretty damn near perfect."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in the city!!  Crisp arabic bread on the outside of your pita makes all the difference in the world!  The seasoning whether it be on beef, lamb or chicken is spot on.  Topping are always fresh and abundant.  Portions are more than adequate and staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"We got the chicken shawarma here and it was really really good! We moved to Calgary from Toronto and this is one of our favourite places here now. Sooooo good and the staff are so friendly!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Reminiscent of Halal Guys of New York. We ordered the mixed shawarma platter and mixed shawarma wrap. The platter has everything including rice, potatoes with garlic sauce, salad and hummus with pita. Great value!!  The salad really adds colour and freshness to the platter.  All of the meats are given a quick pan fry to warm and crisp it up, an absolute necessity if you ask me.  Each component of the platter is fresh and flavorful. 

The wrap is unbelievable!  They use two different textured wraps. The inner wrap is a pita and the outer wrap has a more chewy texture. Not only is it chewy, but it is simultaneously crispy. The chewiness adds to the integrity of the wrap ensuring the contents remain inside and do not spill out or mix with the sauces to gradually disintegrate the pita. The wrap is packaged in a waxed envelope pocket for convenient eating.

We also ordered two falafels. They are cooked to order so you know it's fresh. We ate every morsel. 

Personally don't like the sweet sauce, but we got all the other sauces. 

Highly recommended and will be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We just had an amazing meal here. We both ordered the wraps with everything in it. 
Try the sweet sauce. It's got an amazing indescribable flavor. It was so good my husband had to order another one. The food is fresh and delicious. Friendly and enjoyable. Open late. We re from the U.S. but will defiantly come back when in Calgary again. It's the best Arabic / Mid East food we've ever had."}
{"text":"This workhorse of a shwarama shop is really good, their meat spits look fresh, they make up your falafel right there for you, they have the classic desserts, they got Vimto and they sell sheesha, but no, you can't smoke it there.

It's a larger shop, so they have ample seating, but there seems to always be a line regardless of the time of day winding along the case of baklava.
So no wonder the guys making the food don't really smile or chit chat, they are trying to get the food ready now, now, now!
Their assembly system does have a few flaws, like only asking one person what they are having, and when it turns out the person behind in line is also having falafel and the guy already walked all the way back to fridge to put back the mixture, he looks at you like it's your fault you wanted the same thing! 
The wrap dresser, I am now going to claim that is the official title, is all business, he skimps a little on the good veggie toppings (pickles, tomatoes, banana peppers), so urge him for more, but he knows what fits in that wrap without it exploding, so mostly I trust his judgement.

Then when it is time to pay, the guy always working the till makes me feel better, they are always so nice and smiley and then I remember how delicious my falafel is going to be and it always is. So I let the first two worker's surly, assembly line process not get to me.

Eat here, it won't disappoint and they deliver and are open stupid late.

You're welcome."}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean food! Quick, tasty, flavorful food and very friendly restaurant. Had the large chicken shawarma after a really long hike in Banff and boy oh boy it filled me up! It was worth staying hungry for an hr!"}
