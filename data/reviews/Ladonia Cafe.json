{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Vegan. But you certainly I don't need to be a vegan to enjoy and appreciate the quality of the ingredients and the excellent execution. The sweet potato tamales were soft and flavorful, and the tempeh BLT was just about prefect."}
{"text":"There should be more reviews for this cart. It is amazing food. Even meat eaters should give this vegan cart a chance because it is so delicious. Things I've tried: chocolate chip waffles, tempeh bacon, tamales, quinoa salad. I am not exaggerating when I say I would eat here every day. It is too bad I work up by the square because I would make that happen more often. I also know the cart is closed for winter, but I will be an eager customer in the spring. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ladonia is my favorite food cart on the Square. Like the Good Food Cart, it has good soups. Unlike Good Food, those soups are always vegan, and they offer waffles, tamales, pot pies, and pumpkin chocolate chip muffins as well. All vegan. All tasty. Many options are gluten free, and the soups and tamales feel like some of the healthiest fare on the Square.   What could make Ladonia four or five stars? The food is good but it doesn't push boundaries of flavor. I'd love to have something that made me stop and go \"wow\" or encounter a spice level that worked on my sinuses. For now, Ladonia is my top spot for a purchased lunch during the work week, but it doesn't top home cooked food."}
{"text":"I can't resist the vegan Frito Pie from Ladonia Caf√© (Madison, Wisconsin food truck). This delicious dish is not always available, but I buy it whenever possible. It is mildly spicy, and the vegan cheese sauce is better tasting than any recipe that I've tried making at home. Even my non-vegan/non-vegetarian friends enjoy this dish. I've heard this dish also referred to as a vegan \"Walking Taco.\"  Ladonia's food cart is usually parked on the south side of the Capitol Square during weekdays. I've had other entrees from Ladonia that are tasty, but the Frito Pie is my favorite. Good eats!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Wonderful eating experience! I highly recommend their ginger limeade, vegan BLT, and chocolate chip waffles. They are all delicious and vegan! My husband loves their tamales, too. I was skeptical to try tempeh after a negative experience a few years ago but decided to give their version of a BLT (bacon-flavored tempeh, lettuce and tomatoes on batch bakehouse bread) a try at the recent Isthmus a la carts food cart festival. I think I went back three times for another piece! It is the stuff dreams are made of! So delicious!   I'm always excited to see Ladonia's Cafe at local festivals and I never even consider going to other carts!   Bonus: the cooks/owner is super friendly and they accept credit/debit cards!"}
{"text":"The food at this cart is SO delicious- although I have to disclose that so far I've only tried the waffle platter (I don't live in Madison so I only have the opportunity to have it once in a while and it's just so good I haven't been able to make myself try something else!). The chocolate chip waffle is fluffy and perfectly cooked, the tempeh \"bacon\" is some of the best I've ever had (so flavorful, not hard/dry at all), and the potatoes are delicious as well. It's probably good that I don't have easier access to Ladonia because is eat here all the time- definitely give it a try if you see them around!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tempeh bacon-lettuce-tomato.  I've been tempted to try everything on the menu but the BLT is so darn tasty I can not resist it!  Ladonia offers plenty of gluten free yumminess and limeade.  This mobile cafe is a wonderful addition to the Library Mall carts.  A must try!!!"}
{"text":"My wife uses Ladonia's tamales to incentivize me into going to the Farmer's Market almost every weekend. They're sooo good, and healthy.   The best thing about eating plants is that there is no indigestion or heaviness afterward. By replacing meats with plants, you eliminate cancer, diabetes, heart disease, diseases of inflammation, and obesity. If you do the research, all are directly attributed to the consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs. For more information, watch Forks Over Knives, or read ANY non-industry funded large-scale/long-term clinical  study: The China Study, The Adventist Health Study, The Nurses Health Study, PREDIMED, the Epic Health Study, etc. There is no question in the scientific community that meat consumption is extremely dangerous, so much so that processed meats are even declared Class-1 carcinogens in the US. That should alarm you when ALL meat sold in the US is processed with chemicals for preservation, even the expensive \"local\" garbage."}
{"text":"I love this place!   The have a special of Mac and Cheese that I love and probably have ate way too much of!  They have yummy three bean chili.   They have chocolate chip waffles too!"}
{"text":"I just want to reiterate how excellent this place is. Vegan BLT is the best I've ever had. Tamale platter is an extra special treat for when I don't want to eat bread. There is now coconut chocolate pudding which always improves my day. The pot pies are everything you ever wanted a pot pie to be, that it wasn't. Perfect mac & cheese with the biggest, best, most satisfying shell pasta. And if there is ever a daily special (or dessert!) that isn't normally on the menu, do not pass it up."}
{"text":"I love this place! Ladonia Cafe has somehow come up with a menu including all of my favorite foods. Tamales, waffles, and the best vegan BLT I've ever had. Their tempeh bacon is so flavorful. It is the perfect balance of sweet, smoky, and salty. And the bread! It's so fresh and soft and crusty. I miss you already, Ladonia!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I've had the tamales and three bean chili so far and I was extremely satisfied with both. Service is great (very friendly and efficient! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I headed to the Ladonia Cafe food cart after a friend told me that it is one of the best in Madison (after you read this you can call me your friend - that way a friend is telling you to try them also!!!). To be entirely honest, I walked over with an open mind and open expectations. I didn't really think I was going to like the food just from the descriptions and my personal \"taste\"...  I was wrong. Very, very wrong!  After arriving I ordered the tamale platter. Two tamales, rice, beans and salsa served on a bed of greens for $8.00. I was told (by my friend) that this should be my order. One each of a sweet potato tamale and a black bean tamale. Now that I am your new friend, I suggest you order the same without hesitation!  Very friendly operators and quick service. Exactly what I am looking for in any food cart. My open expectations are still open but my first impressions have made me to start to liking Ladonia Cafe already!  The platter was heavy. It was an immediate \"WOW - this is a substantial amount of food!\" I made myself a promise not to open it up until I walked the 4 minute distance to my office and I was very interested in what it looked like inside. The smell and the weight made me feel like a kid holding a present that kept me wondering what was inside (and it could only be something good). My open expectations are now becoming more defined. I am starting to become impressed.   Back at the office and it's opening time. Very well presented - smells amazing and I can't wait to dig in. I start with the rice and beans. Great flavor and consistency. The consistency is what really made me happy. Not dry, not sticky in a bad way and not runny. This portion of the platter goes down easily and is a great starter. The beans have some smokiness and the sides aren't a \"sideshow\". They absolutely make their own statement!  I tasted the salsa. This is heavenly salsa. This is salsa that you wish you had every time you have salsa. This is \"I'll buy a jar of that for $15.00!\" salsa. It seems odd to focus so much on such a small piece of the platter but the salsa made a HUGE impression on me. This salsa is evidence that not all salsa is created equal. If I had to think of one negative thing to say about the platter from Ladonia Cafe is that I wish there was more salsa. A lot more salsa. Next time I go (which will be soon) I will be asking for more salsa. As your new Yelp friend take my advice and ask for more salsa!!!  The tamales were fantastic. I enjoyed both but the sweet potato tamale was my favorite. I was again impressed by the consistency. Not dry, not mealy and not sticky. The flavor of each tamale was brought to life by the filling and not the masa. They were cooked very well, easy to eat and each delivered a new taste.   I didn't really \"get\" why the food was on a bed of greens but I ate them. Tough to argue against something that is good for you and tastes good when mixed up with all the remaining \"bits\" in the platter. I don't think they really add to the platter but they certainly don't take anything away.  Ladonia Cafe delivers a ton of food in their tamale platter. I guarantee you will be full if you finish it all! There aren't many times that I would say that street cart food is a \"good deal\" but this was a GREAT deal! I hope they don't do it but they could increase the price by a dollar or two and it would be entirely justified.   So, I really, really liked the tamale platter at Ladonia Cafe. They deliver high quality food and a great price and exceeded my expectations. They've made a believer out of me and I owe my friend a HUGE thank you for recommending them. Do yourself a favor and take a recommendation from your new friend (me) - order up some food from Ladonia Cafe and prepare to be just as impressed as I was (ask for more salsa!!!)."}
{"text":"This is so far my favorite food cart!! The sweet potato tamales are amazing and the portion size is definitely worth the price.  The pot pie is amazing, I don't know how they pull off making it taste like a chicken pot pie without the chicken. There is also a little kick to it which I appreciate. The creamy broccoli soup is also very flavorful. Haven't tried the pudding or mac and cheese yet, but my friend raves about it.  This is definitely my go to food cart when I forget my lunch."}
{"text":"I didn't realize how much I liked this cart until recently; they're closed for the winter now, and I'm having cravings like the dickens. Ladonia Cafe's winter hibernation leaves me especially missing the chocolate chip waffles with home fries, the ginger limeade, and the tamales. The tempeh bacon is a bit too sweet for my taste-- is it BBQ sauce on it?-- but still not bad, for fake bacon. Which, I admit,  sets the bar pretty low.  Very fair prices and portions, and no Styrofoam boxes, hooray! I'll be right there when they reopen in the spring. (Fingers crossed that they will? Food carts come and go at a dizzying rate on Library Mall.)"}
