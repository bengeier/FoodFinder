{"text":"The best taco spot in Phoenix. $2 bottles of Corona during happy hour. I like tacos. Yelp is really asking for too many characters here to post this review, but yeah! Tacos! Great! Beers! Cheap! Staff! Cool! Go eat there, dangit!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos at great prices!  We had the carne Asada, pollo asado and carnitas tacos and we enjoyed all of them!"}
{"text":"Order was wrong and taco shells are store bought. If you are familiar with San Diego taco shops and want something of that nature, you will be disappointed. If you want ok meat and don't care that taco shells are store bought then you'll be fine. Two stars because maybe its an off night but I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Taco Mich is a dive. The jukebox blares loud Norteno music. Everything is served on paper plates. The foosball table has no ball (although admittedly we've never asked if they had it behind the counter). It's the perfect atmosphere for the awesome authentic food they serve up.

This place is near our house and has become our go-to for cheap delicious tacos and burritos. They have the full fare you'd expect, and they have beer and cocktails. You order at the counter, and the staff is always friendly and the service quick. They always have several daily and regular specials going on. The food and drinks are very affordable.

If you're looking for great casual and authentic Mexican food in a more than casual atmosphere, this is the place. If you want take-out, this is the place. We love it especially for quick lunches and the occasional breakfast burrito.

I highly recommend Taco Mich!"}
{"text":"I am from California and it is hard to find any great Mexican food around my area. This is the closes I can get. Cheap tacos and decent taste..."}
{"text":"This place is great, I'm from Los Angeles & this is the closest to legit Mex I found so far. I love the tacos & combos, FYI they recently changed their name to Tacos Michoac√°n. No more alcohol under new management, but the food is still the same!
Tacos de Lengua & Pastor are da bomb!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat in, however my husband brought home 12 tacos for us on Taco Tuesday.  Very authentic street tacos and at 75 cents each.. you can't beat it.  Taco Tuesday is going to be our new ritual."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch and literally shocked little tiny place and a small strip area but literally impressed by the food and the homemade horchata is amazing. definitely a hidden little gem.  loved the steak tacos and all the fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"The \"fish\" taco platter is very unappetizing looking . Taste isn't even there . Looked like French fries all thin . For 6.99 ? I am not coming back to this one . I literally grabbed the plate and felt disgusted and slightly distracted . Not by the staff but by the food ."}
{"text":"This place is cheap but the food has no flavor. Very bland. The spicy salsa wasn't spicy at all and like the tacos, it had no flavor. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"This newfound hidden gem is awesome! The horchata is a treat. Don't miss this place!

Simple setting but very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The cuisine was the real deal, made from scratch.

Well definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious & the price is right. The place is kind of dumpy, which I don't mind. There seems to be no A/C though. 

The carne asada plate is really good, my husband likes the street tacos & my boys like the bean & cheese burrito! We are fans!"}
{"text":"Typical hole in the wall taco place. Came here on Taco Tuesday. $0.75 street tacos until 8pm. I got the special, $5.99 for 5 street tacos and a 24 oz drink. I asked for 3 carne asada tacos and 2 chicken. 
Tacos came with a red and green sauce. I added the red sauce to my chicken taco and it was spicy!!! Added the green sauce to my other chicken taco and not so spicy. Added a green and red to the carne asada and not so spicy again. The chicken had a nice texture and was still a little juicy. The carne asada had a good flavor but was a little too crispy for my taste. (Side note, this is the third hole in the wall taco place I have been to in Phoenix and they all make the carne asada crispier than I like).
Atmosphere was casual with mariachi music playing and a Mexican tv show on the tv in the corner. Not a bad place. I pass it all the time and I would come back again. I wanna try the pozole or the sopas next time!"}
{"text":"Great place to pick up some great Tacos on the cheap!! If you're looking for super, tasty authentic Tacos...THIS place is for you!
If you're looking for lettuce and cheese...please, just drive on by!"}
{"text":"The tacos are cheap - you get what you pay for. Both hubby and I got sick afterwards. Salsa bar looked like it had been just sitting out for a while, gross."}
{"text":"Real good Mexican food at real good prices.

We got the Arizona burrito, California burrito, carne asada soft shell tacos, and pollo a la plancha hard shell tacos. I also got an horchata to drink, and it was the real thing (not the watery horchata flavored stuff from a fountain).

They were all delicious. The salsa roja is properly spicy, as it should be, not watered down like so many places (I didn't try any of the other salsas, because the roja was so good).

I will certainly be back here again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada quesadilla and a delicious menudo soup on our visit on Saturday. Plus the service was quite efficient.
Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here once a week since we tried it 5 weeks ago!!! Carne asada tacos are the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent value, yummy tacos!! Great little place to grab quick and cheap tacos in an unassuming strip mall."}
{"text":"Food is good they have Tuesday 75 cent tacos. If you use a credit card you get charged 50 cents. Service could be better I've been here 3 times and the lady who takes my order always seems grumpy. Great for a quick bite if you're on the go."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a few nights ago.
Had a selection of their tacos.

Pros: 
- Tacos Al Pastor are really good.
- Other tacos are also good, but not demi-god levels like the Pastor ones. 

Cons:
- Tacos are small.

They have $.75 taco Tuesdays, so will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"This was ok, I don't think I will ever come back. Mainly because the food was nothing special and a little greasy for my taste.  The place is small and in a shopping plaza.  You order at the counter and then take your seat.  A lot of the empty tables hadn't been bussed so we sat all the way in the back.  I had the pastor platter, like I said nothing special, the beans were runny and the rice a little dry.  My husband had the tacos.  He liked his, but not to make the trip again."}
{"text":"Legit Mexican food!

Plate full of Asada with rice, beans and tortillas for $6?  Wow!
Pair it with a bottle of Mexican Coke and you're good to go - Tasty!"}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles, Ca and I was looking around for tacos for dinner before we went to our room to call it a night. 
I came across this place on my Google maps and saw some good reviews.

The tacos are small but they are good. 

The pastor is spicy! I love spicy food and can hardly feel the spiciness but with the pastor I sure did and I enjoyed it. 
The Tripa was good, maybe needed to be a bit crispier but still good. 
Asada was good as well.
The chorizo tacos were amazing :0 not too greasy yet very flavorful. 
The only meat I would suggest not getting is Cabeza. It was GROSS!. I couldn't get the nasty and overwhelming flavor out of my mouth. 

I had a Michelada which was pretty decent. 


We were here on a Sunday night and it was pretty chill. only like two tables were taken, everything else was empty. 

I would most Def come back here."}
{"text":"Service was excellent,  young lady at the register. Ordered chile verde w flour tortillas.  Got corn instead. 3 if them had blue mold. That's just lazy. The prices are cheap because the portions are small. 9\" plate has 1/3 less than Filbertos and 1/2 of Manuel's. I returned the moldy tortillas. Asked if I wanted more. No Thanks! Enough mold for today."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, great daily specials and good horchata. I'm sold. I come here pretty often since I live close by. Never been a let down. Their salsa and hot sauces are great too. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If you're used to \"Americanized\" Mexican food this is not the place for you. But if you want some real Mexican food (especially tacos) 
 at a super good deal and can appreciate a hole in the wall with Mexican music and culture then this is the place for you! I loved it and will def be back again!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food is authentic.. we're just driving by and smelled the deliciousness coming from this direction. Glad we stoppe in.."}
{"text":"It's a real street tacos but in a clean inside environment. They sell beer and sodas and Mexican refrescos. Warning! Lots of spicy food and sauces. The al Pastor is ons spit make sure to ask fur pineapple."}
{"text":"The flavors and meats are amazing. Tripitas, cabeza, and lengua....So happy a legit taco placed opened close to my house."}
{"text":"You want cheap 90 cent tacos that are delicious?! Look no further! If you read the other reviews about this place being legit, well - they can't be more right! Cheap and delicious food?! Si, por favor!"}
{"text":"Love the asada tacos best, but all are pretty yummy. The beans are beyond savory and delicious... Make sure to grabs limes on your way out!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10:40. Door open, lights on, music playing. Lady says, \"sorry we're closed.\"?? It's a slow night, but sign says 11."}
{"text":"Pass by this taco place to drive my son to school. Always tempted by the 75 cent Tuesday taco sign. Finally had a chance to try it. Great tacos. Red salsa that they have in ketchup bottles on the counter is SUPER spicy and reminiscent of King Taco/El Taurino in LA. Al pastor tacos were juicier than asado. Overall great value and great taste. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not so great,,Very sad ! Sopes aren't authentic at all . If you want pre packaged sopes that don't have any crips to them just tossed in the microwave come here!!!Birria was too water based! The rice was too hard , it needs more time to cook! The Salsas were alright , but not so hyped about them. I did like the salsa bar , but it needs a little more love to it. Idk why it was too lonely on a Sunday afternoon ? I was really happy to read other reviews about this place , but for now I will just make my own at home lol"}
{"text":"Eh... If this was based on my experience alone I would give this place 2 stars. But my husband had a mostly positive experience so I'll be generous and round up.

This place is really a hole in the wall. Counter service. Flashing Christmas lights that can bring on migraines. Very loud and rambunctious Spanish music. Children running amok. 

They have a drink menu with decently priced cocktails and beer. My tequila sunrise was tasty but mostly juice with little tequila. 

Food choices for vegetarians were limited. Typical for traditional Mexican food so I wasn't surprised. I went with my go-to cheese enchiladas. It is rare that enchiladas disappoint me but these definitely did. Barely any cheese, mostly corn tortillas. The enchilada sauce was watery and flavorless. Worst of all, the beans (and chips) had a very strong lard taste. I understand that most Mexican food has lard but I'm able to eat a lot of it without detecting the taste. This was so obvious it was disgusting. 

My husband enjoyed his El pastor plate although he wasn't completely blown away. His drink was weak too.

It has been almost 30 minutes since I ate half of that meal and my stomach is in serious distress."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. We tried  a varied of food on the menu and all were delicious (beef flautas were just  ok).We live in a border town and know authentic Mexican food, this place delivered the real thing. Beans were heaven on the plate!!!!"}
{"text":"Will try more of the menu. Carne and chicken 5 tacos, pico de gallo, with soda is a bargain & enough for 2. The carne is diced, but just a tad overcooked. Generous meat portions and all the fixins at the salsa bar. I Went back for Menudo Sunday and it just right. Just like Abuelitas. Suegra. Next visit posole on Thursdays."}
{"text":"This place looked really legit walking up to it: escabeche, radish, salsa, pico etc bar. Looking at the menu, I saw that the tacos were now 1.10 rather than .90 - not a big deal, but just letting people know the update. We ordered chilaquiles and 3 tacos(al pastor, goat, and asada) = ~$8.50. What a steal! The prices here were amazing! 

Chilaquiles: The eggs were overcooked, the salsa verde was bland. 
Beans: Bland and runny
Rice: Bland and a little dry
Tacos:
Al Pastor: Flavored amazingly
Goat: Very strong goat flavor, but good
Asada: Flavorful as well

So, come for the meat. I think this place has really flavorful meat items. Also, the red salsa is better than the green hands down. I will be back for .75 tacos on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"First off Taco Tuesday $.75!!  Till 8pm Happy hour $1-$2 till 7pm these tacos are amazing!! I even ordered the wrong thing and the owner was nice enough to make me something else because they have amazing customer service! If you haven't been you are missing out."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and reasonable prices. The food is highly seasoned and more like traditional Mexican fare. This is the place to be on Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Birria Chivo for $6.49..Great Deal and it tasted perfectly.
Homemade Pineapple drink was too sweet for my taste but the Horchata was just right."}
{"text":"Very authentic and reasonable.  First visit and had the 5 street tacos.  Fresh and flavorful. The hot sauce is on point too!!! Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I don't get the high reviews. The food is ok at best. The street tacos? I ordered 5 on taco tuesday, the package was only slightly bigger than my cell phone, not street tacos, micro tacos. I was checking the menu on my wait anticipating what I'd try on my next visit, I think the answer is I'll try somewhere else. I am not a fan of the \"bertos\" but I'd go there instead of here."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad to say about this place. Only good!!! Every time we come to see our mechanic we HAVE TO stop into this taco joint right down the street. Their carne asada tacos are SOOOO yummy. They're PERFECTION!!! I love how they play Mexican music too lol. It makes me feel like I'm in Mexico!!"}
{"text":"We have a plethora of taco shops on this side of town yet it's great to have one of the best nearby. Huge menu ranging from the favorites (tacos, quesadillas etc) and then some authentic meals not as common. Taco Tuesday is always a great choice: our family of four can eat for less than $20!
Also, they serve booze here! Not just beer yet cocktails too. 
Small patio outside too so when it's cooler (a few hours out of the year), the option to sit outside is available. You get a view of Cave Creek Rd yet at least your outside!
Come by and try Taco Mich & Bar!"}
{"text":"This places tacos are so delicious and affordable. I recommend getting carne asada, pastor and my favorite Tripas. If you get the tripas I would suggest you telling them to make them extra crispy! They also have a bar, salsa bar, ice cream and a music juke box. Any time is a good time to come here because there not as packed as there other locations. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Spectacular tacos and great value. Had the Carne Asada tacos and chicken tacos. The red salsa has a little bit of a kick to it and has a great flavor. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a little place that just keeps it simple and it's amazing.  Taco Tuesday you can get .75 cent street tacos!!! Their Pastor is seriously addicting. I came here based off the reviews and I can see why!"}
{"text":"Bomb tacos for cheap. I'm pathetically picky when it comes to tacos & finding this place was magical. I'd go here for every meal everyday if I wasn't lazy. They aren't down the street but those taco deals are def worth the 15 min drive."}
{"text":"This place has 75 cent tacos... like in a city that overcharges you for mediocre Mexican food is was impressed and will def be a regular from now on on Tuesday when they offer this deal. The tacos were good and they have a lot of different juices that are great to choose from as well. Last but not least the food is super fast despite being a little busy. Quite possibly the fastest Mexican I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood find!  We did 2 of  the 5 tacos and drink for $5.99 deal and added sides of rice and beans.  We tried the carne asada, adovada and carnitas.  Yummy little double corn tortilla street tacos.  This will be our new taco go to spot.  Nothin' fancy just great, fresh tacos and friendly service."}
