{"text":"The food was just ok. I lived in the Korean town in LA for long time I am very picky with my Korean food it just not too much of taste."}
{"text":"We were so happy when we passed by this place.. and even though we bought our groceries, we just had to eat here. We got black bean noodle and fried pork (tangsuyuk). Not only did our food take awhile (it wasn't busy and they had so many workers in the back).. both items were warm/cold. The fried pork was just horrible. I've had really good tangsuyuk in California and this thing was nothing like it. It was cold, oily and rubbery.and if you're wondering we had the sauce in the side so the breading wouldn't get soggy but it didn't even matter the pork itself tasted like it was fried and just sat on the side some where.. oh and the portion size is extremely small if you have the sauce in the side..I don't know why that is but my husband and I looked at each other thinking it was a kids meal. I mean for the price, let's not be to stingy please!!!! Noodles were better but it was cold and extremely oily. I would say it had more flavor than other jajangmyun places I ate in AZ but it was still lacking. So why the 1 star? Well, after telling the staff at the cash register both the Korean lady and the Hispanic girl was really rude and not helpful what so ever..didn't bother to make it right (even offering to heat up my food would've been great) they just told me that's how it is!!! Really?!? Yup! that's what customers like to hear...not!!! ?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon just shortly after 12pm and the restaurant was packed from the shoppers to the employees working at the Asiana Market next door.  I ordered #7 which is Bokkeunmyeon that includes pork, shrimp, and squid mix with thick round noodles.  The food portion was big enough to stuff me, however the sauce was very sweet that I had to keep drinking water to wash it down.  Everything is self served here.  They do not have to-go menu, you order what you want from the counter and you put in the to-go cup/box yourself.  Overall service was good."}
{"text":"Cant customize your jajangmyeon , has to have the meat, cant buy extra veggies. the asian girl working the front is inpatient and you can see her frustration , body language etc. I asked the front girl if there is any difference between the jajangmyeon they served and the one I can purchase at asiana in the fridge section (instant noodle type). She said it's the same , looks like I overpaid for instant noodle lunch."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I was hesitant of trying this place at first but hearing good things from my friends aka test subjects that it was good. So then I went for myself with a friend and ordered the jajangmyeon. The portion was enough for 2 people in my opinion, so maybe order the tangsuyuk cause you a real one. The pork was tender and the sauce was good, though was slightly bland. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place while I was driving by, and I was incredible surprised at how good their Ja Jang Myun was.  I didn't get to try any other dishes on the menu, but this noodle dish was top notch.  I think it was the second best Ja Jang Myun I had in my entire life, and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"Yum!! I came here the other weekend when I was exploring the new Asiana, and was very pleasantly surprised! They only had options #1, 5, and 8 available at the time, so we tried #1 and 5...  #1 is a spicy kimchi style stew, with lots of octopus, mussels, and other seafood! It was a huge portion, and the spice definitely grew over time.   #5 is a black bean noodle dish with pork. It has quite a mild flavor, which I really liked in comparison with the spicy stew.   Personally, I preferred #1, but I love soups so I was biased towards that option from the start. My friend LOVED #5 tho -he actually went back the next day to eat it again for lunch! Both were delicious, and I'd highly recommend coming here if you're in the area or looking for a new noodle spot :)"}
{"text":"I heard Paik's noodles was opened and I had to go try it.  Before I go into the food two things you need to know before you go.  They do not have carry out and they do not have drinks.  They do have water off to the side in small cups so you at least have something.  I would have rates this higher if they had both options.  With take out I would be able to go more often since I could grab and go.  The food -  I ordered a bowl of Jajangmyeon.  I first had this dish in S. Korea and it tasted the same.  I really enjoyed it.  My one complaint is that it needs more pork.  Not a ton more just a little more.  There was only a couple very tiny pieces.  I kind of felt like why put it in the dish if you are going to give that much.  It's not a deal breaker though because I still liked the dish.    The serving size was perfect.  It was enough to fill you but not put you in a food coma when you get back to work.    Be warned the place was packed during lunch so give yourself extra time.  I suspect once the other resturant opens seats are going to be at a premium."}
{"text":"Great jajangmyeon but there is too much onion and I only like a portion of onion. The noodles are handmade but technically the dough that is put into a noodle machine. The price is cheap $7.99 for the bowl. The noodles are glossy, soft, and chewy. I recommend this place for their noodles. 4 star is because there are just a few pieces of pork in my black bean paste with too much onions."}
{"text":"This is in the simple food court of the newly opened Asiana Market.  This is a famous chain from Korea and there are 3 entrees that Koreans love to eat-the spicy noodles, black bean noodles and sweet and sour pork.   They are decently priced with good portions.  So glad to have this here in AZ."}
{"text":"Very happy this chain has landed in Mesa and inside the shiny new Korean market!  The food court feel and quick service is even better.  Although it's been a few months since opening, they still are only offering 3 items of the full menu.  At least those are the 3 major items people go for.  The champong broth is one of the best I've had. Super flavorful and not overbearingly spicy.  I do wish they put shrimp instead of mussels personally. It is nearly impossible to customize an order as well.  Half the time they tell you everything is premixed and they can't leave out the mussels.  Hopefully they will serve the full menu soon so I can just order the beef version of the noodle soup.  After some polite convincing, they eventually do leave out the mussels for me.  The ja jang myun is also great and pretty comparable to most places.  Portion sizes are decent and so are prices. Very easy quick go-to place to eat!"}
{"text":"I went in during my lunch craving authentic korean dishes. I ended up ordering the jjampong, which is a seafood noodle soup with clams, nakji, and pork. It was amazing. The broth was so delicious. It was just the right amount of spicy- nose runny spicy. If it weren't 110 degrees out I'd eat this all the time. I will be back to try their tonkatsu and other dish items. They also have free water and a large area for seating. Very good!"}
{"text":"Tried the seafood noodle soup and crispy sweet pork strips.  We thought the food was average and not the typical Korean food.  So while we were walking into the grocery store the owner explained to us that it's actually Korean style Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best Asian noodles in Phoenix. Must go. Had the black bean noodle, spicy seafood noodle, and sweet and sour pork. A plus for everything. Great service and very clean."}
{"text":"Really good Korean food. The menu selection is limited but the portions are huge for a pretty low price. I ordered the black bean noodles and they were great. The sauce was thick and there was plenty of noodles. You can even grab a pickled side dish. My Korean friend says this place is authentic! I'm going to come back to try the huge noodle bowls and fried pork dishes.   Located in the new Asiana market and the Tous les Jours bakery, this entire plaza is turning out to be a really good place for Korean centric foodies.   Beware, since they are relatively new, their processes are slow. I waited 45 minutes for my bowl of noodles!"}
{"text":"Tried this place inside of the Asiana Market not too long ago and was relatively impressed. I have never had that type of Korean food, but it was enjoyable. Downside was that when I was there they were only offering 3 of the more than 12 menu items they have. We were meeting our family there and it was about 30 minutes before they were closing. Our family had already gotten food for themselves but when we went to order they said they had stopped serving food. Once we explained our situation they said they could make two of the dishes for us. The noodles were a good texture but the broth could have been spicier in my opinion. Also the fried pork was tasty but definitely not my favorite. Will likely be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"New Chef, New Taste New Star! **** Came back to give Paik's another try and was delighted beyond! The food has so much improved an added star was in order. Ordered the Jjammpong, and Jajangmyeon (my favorites) and a world of difference ensued. Downright fresh, tasty, and beautifully plated and presented. It's wonderful these plates have improved  as will my presence. *************Update****************  I'm hoping it was Grand Opening shivers, or first week of business jitters. Whatever made this meal less than stellar, I'm willing to try Paik's Noodle again. Can't say it was downright awful (no resurrection there) but it left an impression perhaps the kitchen was not quite ready to handle the loads of people. With all this being said, here's the skinny:  We ordered a total of 3 dishes: Jjamppong- the best of the 3 dishes although thats not saying very much. It was deficient in the flavorful spiciness thats shown in the picture. It was fresh and smelled good but lacked depth.  Tangsuyuk- this is usually a favorite of mine most likely because its fried. Again, there was a missing element of flavor; tried with and without the sauce to depict what was failing but couldn't place it. Jajangmyeon- looked beautiful, had a great aroma, and was piping hot! I was excited to dig in and then Boom! Reality hit! Flat as a door. Disappointment is a soft word here. This dish somehow had an \"industrial\" taste such as plastic or vinyl; very hard to describe.  Upon reflection, the food tasted as though it was \"hurriedly\" made/cooked. Without enough time allowed for the flavors to mesh and develop. Hence my theory that the kitchen was unable to quickly produce meals for the Grand Opening mass of people.  There is a table with condiments and fwater placed within the seating area  Will return as I'm sure the \"kinks\" will be adjusted and refined."}
{"text":"Their jjampong was too salty so I complained about it. The lady said that all of their food gets shipped to them and they can't do anything about it. Then she handed me a bowl of hot water to pour it in. The service was poor and apparently they don't make their own food and just reheat everything."}
{"text":"Located in food-court area of the new Asiana, this is definitely a place I want to go to again. I was there a week ago, and they are currently serving a limited menu of only 4 items. I got the jajangmyeon (black been noodles), and it was a good portion size and delicious in flavor. The sauce was thick and delicious. The amount of sauce they give you is the perfect amount to coat every noodle. Enough to fill one person up for lunch for sure! They have danmuji on the side as well as a side dish. If I'm ever craving jajangmyeon again, this is where I will be going!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for HongKongBanJum to open up since I really liked their Tangsuyuk. However all of my friends who went there since opened, are very disappointed. They were only serving 3 menu, Jjajangmyun, JJampong, and Tangsuyuk. They did not have To-Go option or Pick-up until a week ago. Even though I heard so many bad thing about this place, I still wanted to try. I ordered Jajangmyun and tangsuyuk. Despite of bad reviews from my friends, it was not that bad. I would not say it is better than other place but it was ok. The real problem is the price. It is not cheap. PAIK's place is popular because of its cheap price, not really of their tasty food. This place is ruining Paik's reputation. This is Big No-No. In addition, I would advice them to open up the restarant when they r fully ready. People r still very disappointed.  I might still eat here since it is located where we do our grocery and will be convenient."}
{"text":"The last time we came here, they expanded to serve their entire menu, which is nice. Here are the dishes we've tried: - Jjampong: A great deal, with a generous portion of seafood. The noodles have a good degree of spiciness with a nice flavor. The soup is also good. - Jjajangmyeon: Tastes reminiscent of yakisoba. Not much meat, which is a little disappointing. Still tastes good though. - Tangsuyuk: Very crispy and not too much breading. The sauce tastes like honey but not as sweet."}
{"text":"Paik's noodles is a Korean jajaingmyeon, jampong, Tangsuyuk chain. I've been eating this for years back in California. There's nothing quite like a meal of jajaingmyeon and a Korean drama session with the little sister   Super excited when I saw that this opened in AZ! KBBQ, jajaingmyeon, another Korean shop, Asiana, boba tree... this plaza is getting so LIT.   I came on their soft opening so, not all the menu items are ready yet, but they had my jajaingmyeon (Black bean noodles with shredded pork) and Tangsuyuk (Pork strips deep fried with a rice flour batter + a sweet sauce)  I'm happy to say it's the same taste I've been eating back in CA. Come and give it a try!"}
{"text":"The noodles here are so good!!! It makes me come back for more all the time! It's very affordable with the best taste of Korean noodles . black bean noodles is my best!"}
{"text":"Jiampong Lack of seafood , spices n flavor ,all I tasted is the saltiness of anchovies . they only put squids, mussels and some slices of porks( supposinglly seafood??) . For $9 a bowl of \"pho \" would be worthy  not this  First time and last time. I've had better jiampong elsewhere"}
{"text":"The jajangmyun was good but could use a tad more flavor. The tansuyuk (sweet n sour pork) was really good. I don't have much to compare to having only tried jajangmyun in the Phx area (which is only at 3 diff places) but I prefer Chef Chiang's jajangmyun as it is a little more flavorful and you get the side of onions, which I loove. This place is set up like a food court inside of the Asiana Market and does not have any drink options. They have self serve water on the side though. Currently, they are only serving 3 items off of their menu (jampong, jajangmyun and tansuyuk). The service was fast and it was convenient."}
{"text":"Paik's Noodle is the only place that I know of in the Phoenix area that serves Jajangmyun and Jjamppong so I can't really compare it to anything. All I can say is I was excited to know they serve these traditional Korean dishes. I was a little disappointed though. I felt that the jajangmyun (Black bean noodles) did not have enough flavor to it. It was too sweet. It was missing more of the pork and black bean flavor to it. Although the jjamppong had a good tasting broth, it still wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it would be. It's a bit bland and the soup did not stick to the noodles well. I was hoping for a burst of seafood flavor."}
{"text":"Located inside the new Asians Market food court, a decent franchise addition to the valley.  The Jajangmyun won't turn any heads but not too bad.  Tangsuyuk was crisp but the sauce a bit lacking.  Overall, it's food court fare.  Not a destination but maybe an occasional stop after some grocery shopping."}
{"text":"I had a pretty debilitating bout of stomach flu last week, and this was the first day I could finally eat something other than applesauce, chicken noodle soup, and congee. I figured why not celebrate by trying out this new eatery?  I got here on opening day maybe an hour after they officially opened. It looked like half the Asian population in the Phoenix area was eating here lol. The menu is pretty succinct but all the items on it looked delicious. There was a really long lag in ordering since there seemed to be a little confusion with some existing orders. When it was my turn to order I went with the #5 jajangmyeon. I actually wanted to get it to go but apparently they don't offer that here (Boo). Although I had to wait a long time to actually order the jajangmyeon was made in a few short minutes. It looked so tempting and was a big portion. We grabbed some chopsticks, etc. from the side counter (It also had forks, napkins, and condiments). I took it to one of the tables in the food court area and started digging in!  The noodles were plentiful and cooked a touch beyond \"al dente\". The sauce was smooth but the flavor wasn't as bold as other jajangmyeon I've had in the past. It was too oily for my tastes and I would have liked more cucumber(?) than the small tiny mound on top. I was also disappointed to find that 90% of the sauce had only onion and cabbage in it, with some small scraps of meat.  I didn't see any options for beverages here (Other than a water cooler in the corner) which I thought was odd but I suppose you could just buy a beverage from Tous Les Jours next door.  Although I didn't totally enjoy the jajangmyeon, some other items on the menu looked really enticing, especially the tangsuyuk so I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but they have been open for almost a month now and they only serve three items. We came here late afternoon on a Saturday and we are waiting for over 45 mins for our food. Very poor managing their restaurant when you still took orders and he whole kitchen crew decide to take a break. They should of been upfront about this when we placed our order. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Came at a slow hour. The cafeteria was empty except for us. I tried asking the cashier about their menu but she was rude and not helpful at all. She had no interest in helping us choose or understand anything on the menu. The food was not bad but not great either in my opinion. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Went a week after their grand opening and they only served 3 items on their menu: #1 Jjampong ($8.25), #5 Jajangmyeon ($7.99), & #8 Tangsuyuk (sweet & sour pork) ($10.99). We ordered all 3. Prices are high for a food court place. Waited awhile before getting my food. #1 was ok, the broth tasted just like one of the popular korean brand instant noodle's package seasoning. The sauce in #5 was too sweet, not to my liking. And the sweet and sour sauce on #8 was awful--very thick and gooey. Not to my liking at all. I don't think we will go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out but the lady was to busy doing other stuff that I got no acknowledgement or anything.. waited a few minutes but nothing so I just left"}
{"text":"Located inside the Asiana food court. Right next to Tous Le Jours Bakery! I am excited for all the brand new places that are popping up here :D  The day I went, they only had their noodles available, but I heard that their wings are delicious as well.   I ordered the jajangmyeon (#5) on the menu. It was delicious! I recommend trying that for your first time and hen venturing to their other menu items.   Will update my review once I get a chance to try the wings."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese Korean noodle shop has arrived! This shop is located in the new Asiana plaza. If I had only one meal left on this earth let me die happy with  a giant bowl of jajangmyun!   What is Jjangmyun? (Try to say this 10x fast). It's a carbtastic Korean-Chinese giant noodle bowl slathered in black bean sauce.   This chain offers affordable prices at 7.99! If your  lost here just order #5 or order #1 Spicy Jjampong- Seafood Udon soup.  Better yet grab a buddy so you can try  both!   Today for grand  opening there was a wait but I'm sure they will smooth it out soon."}
{"text":"Finally a decent place to get jajangmyeun in AZ. This place recently opened and it's still bit chaotic when ordering, but the orders come out fast and hot. Everyone seems to order jajangmyeun and jjampong combo to share so not very complicated in ordering. I also tried tangsuyuk here and it was really good. It had nice crunch from rice flower coating and came with sweet sauce with vegetables. Menu is simple and last time I was there they didn't offer mandoo yet, but hope they do real soon.  Location is perfect next to the new Asiana Market. I can see this place very popular among Asians like me who like to shop and eat."}
{"text":"\"Noodles are not only amusing but delicious.\" ? Julia Child  I went in with high hopes and for the most part, I walked away feeling a little disappointed. The #5 Jajangmyeon was very mild in flavor.  I was expecting that burst of flavor that accompanies black beans usually.  Instead, their jajangmyeon was sweet and heavy on oyster sauce.  It actually reminds me of this one time when I poured teriyaki sauce on my lo mein except Jaik's version has more onions and some pieces of meat.  We also got the #1 Jjamppong which wasn't that spicy at all.   Will I be back?  Perhaps.  Prices are reasonable and portions are generous.  It's a decent place to get a fast meal without that fast food feeling.  It's food court fare so what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"When we first arrived here for lunch, their menu selections were down to 3 items only (I am not sure why since it was only 12:30pm.)   The black bean paste noodles are simply amazing! The noodles are so soft that it melts in your mouth. The last time I had noodles this good was when I was still living in Los Angeles. FYI - this is a food court type of dining. If you are in the general area, I highly recommend you to give it a try."}
