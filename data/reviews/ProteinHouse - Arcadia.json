{"text":"A little pricey but worth it. Cool, clean and modern inside. Delicious, healthy food. Large menu with lots of choices."}
{"text":"I was passing through the area on business and was trying to recover from a wicked hangover. Thank you for the recommendation from the young lady who walked me through the menu. I remember her for her unique name. Elika, if I remember the spelling correctly. Job well done by this young lady. Thank you."}
{"text":"I have found a new favorite! I can eat here 5 days a week. Great quality meat and fresh veggies. The only thing is if your counting macros their measurements seem to vary per cook. All my meals have been great with the exception of one time there was an extreme amount of sauce on the bowl I ordered. If you are counting calories/macros I recommend getting sauce on the side."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I ordered the Berry Lovers Salad with Chicken.  The chicken was delicious...good flavor and moist.  The problem was the dressing.  They dress it with way too much dressing.  In fact, the dressing was so heavy, that I ate the chicken and berries and left the greens.  Seems counterproductive to skip the greens, but the amount of dressing made it unbearable to eat.  So...lesson here is ask for dressing on the side or LIGHTLY dressed."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place as it is near my office and right up my alley. Was a bit shocked at the $20 price for a bowl and a drink. Fast casual is apparently moving right up the price chain! Anywho, the bowl smelled great in my car. That's the highlight. Smelled great. 

I ordered my steak medium and as you can see by the picture it was cooked to basically dog food status. There is also a crusty gelatinous substance spread about that appears to be overcooked as well. That gelatinous substance doesn't taste bad, it definitely looks bad though. 

Overall, I am thoroughly disappointed and would not recommend giving this place a try for a few months. That should give them time to get it straightened out or perish. Lots of $20 lunch choices in the area and this is no longer on my list."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant as soon as it opened. I've eaten there twice now, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Both times the person who took my order was not very welcoming. They seemed uncomfortable and distracted, even though the restaurant was not busy. The first time I had the berry lover's salad with chicken. It consisted of spinach, strawberries, berries, cheese and chicken for $10.99. The second time I had a salad with beef, vegetables and romaine lettuce for $12.99. Both salads were ok, but awfully plain and pretty bland given the price. I know the hook is that they are healthy and I appreciate that, but salads with these simple ingredients should not cost more than $7 or $8, especially considering the venue is a counter-serve restaurant with minimal decor, service or ambiance. I doubt I will go back for salads at these prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place.  Food is awesome in flavor, simple preparation, and friendly helpful staff.  Price is a little higher than you might anticipate, however portion size of quality ingredients delivers value for your money.  It's worth paying a little extra to get this high of quality food prepared in such unique ways.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Don't have much experience with these types of restaurants.  Elika was very helpful and made a great recommendation.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped at ProteinHouse for a  breakfast sandwich.  I was able to get a gluten-free bun, egg whites only.  It was tasty and not expensive.  I will be going there again. This a new restaurant in my neighborhood.  I'm glad they are here."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious! I love how macros for everything are listed so you know exactly what you're getting. The cashier was very friendly and helpful with making suggestions for my dad who had never eaten at ProteinHouse before. 

The Portobello Sandwich was super good! I wasn't sure about a mushroom for a bun, but I'll definitely be back for another! The bison burger is also great too!"}
{"text":"Two words: BROtein house 

Pros: athletic patrons, portion sizes and meal options. 

Cons: too pricey, lack of seasoning, having to rely on sugar substitute sauces to flavor your food and their photo booth wall...why???"}
{"text":"lots of healthy choices and variety.  great addition to neighborhood. kind of looks like a gym inside. i try and really support healthy food restaurants which are far and few between and that aren't extraordinarily expensive due to organically sourced food."}
{"text":"Wow I don't like giving a bad review but this cant go on...what a waste of over 40 bucks... and for breakfast! The one breakfast wrap to a very hungry guy went in the trash after a few bites mine was a last cause after 1 bite. The fruit dish was dry like it sat uncovered in the fridge and my green smoothie was ultra thick. My palate just couldn't handle it... sad I had great expectations for this place. If I didn't take it to go for work, I would have asked for a complete refund. 

I guess steroids made them lose their flavor profile."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner the other night.  The food was amazing, I had the Turkey Burger - I have to say the best Turkey Burger I have ever had - Juicy and full of flavor.  The place was busy but I had my \"cooked to order\" burger in no time.  Staff was welcoming and very friendly.  A nice option to have a healthy meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorites and in my opinion one of the only acceptable places to eat out if you are counting macros. This is my go to lunch and breakfast spots when I'm at work. They offer good, whole foods that high in protein and low in sodium and I so appreciate that!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a local restaurant called The Fitness Cafe and it was where bodybuilders would go to have omelettes made with 8 eggs and basically eat like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Unfortunately, this was back in the day before there was a Crossfit gym on every corner and every girl you met was counting her macros and prepping for a fitness competition or a Spartan Race and The Fitness Cafe didn't stay in business.

Since it closed there has been a lot of restaurants opening that serve protein shakes and healthy bowls, but there are not a lot of places where you can load up on protein while still eating substantial food and that is where Protein House fills the void. 

Whether you want a burger made with bison and topped with egg whites or turkey bacon, pancakes made with protein powder, a salad or a healthy bowl, you can find it here. 

Also, its a great looking restaurant and while I wish they had the piles of bodybuilding magazines to read like The Fitness Cafe did, I suppose people eating alone these days will likely be on their phones anyway.

However, it's great to find a place again where you can get a quick, healthy, protein-packed meal when you don't have time to meal prep and pack your own food... oh and by the way, they can provide you with your meal prep if you want them to do that to."}
{"text":"Excellent food - A bit expensive.

Came in on a mission to try the muscle builder burger. Was shocked to see a $16.99 price attached. In fact everything is a tad pricey.

Ordered medium-rare and with sweet potato cubes. 
Ordering was efficient and staff was friendly.

Burger came in a few and I was not disappointed by the taste. Perfectly cooked and a ton of flavor. There's condiments too such as ketchup, mustard, hot sauce and pancake syrup you could even add!

Overall very nice clean place with friendly staff and good tasting food. You'll just have to pay for it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, incredibly good food that is macro friendly and is easy on the stomach. Ashley is super friendly and always remembers my face and makes great recommendations."}
{"text":"I purchased a PH Greek yogurt online. Picked it up. Got back to the office. Ready to dig in. No granola?! bummer. called in. no time to go back. hence the reason I ordered online (time constraints). employee asked if I could come back. lol. yeah...no. took a message and said the manager would call back. no call back. All I ask is to make right. customer service = 0. this happened on 3.20.2018"}
{"text":"This place is managed poorly.   It is one thing to give me the completely incorrect order.  But the way they handled it was terrible.  Go at your own risk.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have ordered from PH through Postmates several times. The food is really good; fresh, simple and healthy. On our most recent order, I had asparagus added to my bison bowl and 
there was only ONE tip, the rest were very woody stalk pieces. Certainly won't keep us from ordering from PH but I will reconsider adding asparagus, which is a shame. The sauces are all fantastic. Also tried a peanut butter protein cookie this time, which was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is straight up dope. Great food- my son and I enjoyed taking pictures at their backdrop. Ordered the root juice and breakfast sandwich. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This place uses fresh, quality ingredients to create meals with high nutritional value without sacrificing flavor. On separate visits I've had their PH chopped salad, the PH burger, and the PH protein pancake combo; I enjoyed every one of those items and it was also comforting to know that I was getting a good dose of protein (this place is great for after-workout meals, obviously) without the significant amounts of fat that would normally be found in those items' counterparts in other restaurants. Even my PH protein pancake combo came with only 3 grams of fat, but a whopping 39 grams of protein. The service is very friendly and the dining space itself is very clean with a simple modern aesthetic. Syrups (maple and agave), organic ketchup and the like are available at the condiment bar area. The high nutritional value of the meals and the high quality of the ingredients used to prepare them means that you will pay a bit more, but considering everything - the nutritional balance, the flavors, the service, the atmosphere - it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"So happy about a spot in Phoenix like this, healthy inventive food for a reasonable price. You get a large portion to split into two meals and great smoothies and juices. This place is friendly and welcoming! It's crazy to me there are a few one star reviews, this area of town people are used to paying a lot for a cool hip place to serve you the same stuff for expensive prices, also new restaurants have to work out a few kinks so giving one star reviews are for terrible humans shoveling crap, this would not be one of those places."}
{"text":"Went here on a little surprise with my girlfriend to check it out. Their menu is pretty extensive with what you can get and also what you can create. I am pretty stoked to try out a few of their creations after having their LR Steak Wrap. It was delicious and the steak has a nice grilled flavor. The menu posted all of their foods macros, which for all my meatheads our there is a must. I am glad to have this place popping up near my house and I would love to eat here every day for lunch if I could. Most meals will cost you about $13 on average, but hey, it's healthy."}
{"text":"Overpriced and rather bland. I did however like that it is clean and they spin good beats not typical music you hear in az. Def look hip.

I think Flower Child is still my go-to-healthier- place-to-eat. Granted, I didnt try the shakes. May be back for that."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't get more attention...it has everything. It's like a ChopShop type place but a way larger menu. It's my favorite go to for a shake after the gym, or a quick and healthy dinner after a long day. Fantastic food, shakes, and treats- my favorite thing ever are the protein peanut butter cookies!!! And the protein bowls are to die for. I'm so happy I randomly wandered in to this place, all the staff are SO nice too. Great energy at all local HEALTHY restaurant! TRY IT"}
{"text":"What a cool place! Everything was fresh and delicious. Super clean, friendly staff and really great ingredients. You must try this place if you are into eating healthy and fresh in a clean environment. Had a build your own bowl that was amazing and my husband had he chop salad with steak that was too die for!"}
{"text":"Best choice for dinner after a workout on a Friday night! Got stellar help and assistance understanding the menu and ordering option from both Rudy and Michelle, who we're attentive and extremely patient and friendly. Ordered the Thai Monster bowl at the recommendation of Rudy, minus grains/low carb, and it was great! All fresh ingredients, from scratch- so filling and satisfying. Very clean environment with Chive TV entertainment projected on a wall- quote engaging for all customers that were there when we were; and happy customers all around. I regret that it took us so long to finally stop by! Again- BOMB food, and they can sub or customize to your preferences. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is super expensive and not a lot of food or flavor. I work right by it.. excited to try it today not impressed at all. Definitely not the the \"hyped\" food they show on IG. I hope they revamp their prices and menu!"}
{"text":"I eat at both locations and the food is always awesome! Today I had the PH Chopped Salad it was full of flavor packed with all the goodies! This is by far the best place in town to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo yummy and healthy! My new obsession has helped me lose about 15lbs simply by eating healthy! I seriously can not go a day without my mocha loca protein shake and my meal prep berries! Muscle boy is pretty darn amazing also! Best breakfast ever!"}
{"text":"This place has it all for those that need to eat healthy. Their customer service is top notch and the food is pretty darn good and healthy, actually healthy. I hope they thrive in the valley so that they may open more locations and I don't have to drive 20 minutes to get there. It's worth the drive though."}
{"text":"The chicken pita is excellent! I also love the Green Hulk protein smoothie. I recommend the Protein House."}
{"text":"Meh.. I haven't had any of their actual food here but I hear it's overrated. Based on the 2 protein shakes here that were mediocre at best, I'm sure the food isn't great either. Also for a place that caters to the health crowd, the staff has no energy or great interaction with the customers. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place this morning. I was pleasantly surprised by it. They are brand new and still setting up. They don't seem to have their operations down and there was some mismatch pricing from the website menu and the in-store menu. The place looks like a place you want to eat but I ordered over the phone after driving past it and the girl didn't seem to know what she was doing. It could've been her first day as this place is brand new. It was fine but made me skeptical about the quality of the food I would receive. I got into the restaurant and they were disorganized. Give them a pass, again they are brand new. I orders the Mediterranean wrap which was pretty good. It subsumed a lot of feta, almost too much. I also received a free muscle freak smoothie due to them making it and originally charging me for it although I never ordered it. Hey, they gave it to me for free so I can't complain. The smoothie was freaking awesome! I'll definitely check this place out again. I think they will be operating and hitting on all cylinders in a month or so."}
{"text":"So healthy!! Everything from the menu is everything you could meal-prep from home. Bowls include: a carb, a meat, and veggies. They also have high protein \"treats\" like cookies and pancakes. So wholesome and delicious. Staff is incredibly nice."}
{"text":"Great spot for not only super healthy fare but very affordable as well. The staff is very friendly in energetic. My sister and I had the the Angus beef salad - so delicious and for only 12.99!? Incredible. Also had the breakfast sandwich - hearty & heart-healthy. Probably the best part was we started off with a Titan shot. Then our day was ON. We'll be back! And not soon enough."}
{"text":"We waited almost 30 min for two To-Go lunches: a Build your Own salad and a chicken rice bowl. 
We were allowed to order things off the menu that they are not currently making or using so they just improvised with my friends order. My rice bowl comes with a BBQ dressing that was not added so there was almost no flavor and it was very dry but the chicken was super over cooked anyway and the turkey in the salad was dry and over cooked. 

The sizes are pretty small for the bowls that are $10 and the salad was $15 and was DEFINITELY not worth the price. 

My friend was not offered any kind of \"nicety\" for the error made by letting her order things off the menu that they aren't making yet. They were kinda rude to her when she was obviously disappointed at not getting what she ordered. 

The food is ok....... It's nothing special in anyway. We won't be going back. None of what they have is worth it."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy foods and cater to multiple diet plans. Get quality and what you pay for with this place. Orders generally take about 5 -10 mins (even smoothies) but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"ProteinHouse is one of our new favorite places to eat! My go-to: Bison Cheesesteak. It is AMAZING! Staff are always friendly, establishment is always clean, and you never wait more than 10 minutes for you food. We will be back today!"}
{"text":"WE LANDED ON THE MOON!!! They did it! They made delicious food that's healthy! The environment is great, and the people are super friendly and helpful. Thanks! You keep doin' you protein House!"}
{"text":"Over priced tasteless place.. was disappointed with my açaí bowl. It was icy. Breakfast wrap was tasteless. I guess you go for the 'protein' but not for flavor. 
Cute decoration though."}
{"text":"Came in with my daughter to try the place out. She did a build your own bowl and I did the Greek. We got our food, get home and the didn't put in the avocado that she put in her \"build her own\". 
She calls them and all that was said to her was sorry, and next time you come in we will give you extra avocado and basically they hung up. Not really impressed with how they handled it..."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by here after our work out today and after having protein house a couple of times I was really excited to have their chicken quesadilla again because it is really yummy with their salsa. I am super picky and always ask what is in something before I eat it. The quesadilla I ordered came with tomatoes and onions in it, where no where on the menu it states it has that and Savannah didn't mention it either when I asked while ordering. 

I got home and realized their mistake, called and asked for it to be remade. I went and picked it up and Savannah did not hardly even look at me or say anything I know people have bad days, but this is not how your front staff should present to paying customers, especially after I came back to pick it up. Other reviews agree with the quality of customer service I experienced. We love the food, but the high prices  and lack of friendly faces really deters me from coming here again."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much at all but was pleasantly surprised. I got the Thai Monster with quinoa and was very good. The only thing that knocks a star is the price. I paid almost 16 dollars for a bowl which is almost half the size of a chipotle burrito bowl. But if you are looking for a healthy source of protein, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Hmmm really wanted to love this place !! Food was ok I ordered a veggie burger which was kinda bland !! The sweet potatoes were bland to . The service I wouldn't say rude but kinda stiff not warm or welcoming just there almost a conceited feel. Also I had no idea do they bring the food to table or what no one explains that . Maybe the protein shakes are better . I just wasn't impressed!! Not saying I wouldn't give it another shot but won't be ordering the veggie burger maybe a protein bowl or something !!"}
{"text":"to say \"meh\" would honestly be a compliment. I had waited for a month for this place to open and have a new choice that offers plant based food. I went in last weekend and waited for 20 minutes even though I was one of two people there. My Black bean burger was obviously and hardly re-heated with a slice of tomatoe that was so thin I could see through it (not to mention it looked like yesterdays slice) The vegan cheese was sparsely sprinkled onto the patty and  not melted at all. The side of potatoes was room temperature and bland. I spent close to 15 dollors. Not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Food is high quality and cooked well, but the food is very bland. I know it's low carb food , but it does lack flavor . Great customer service . I just was hoping for a bit more flavor ."}
{"text":"This place is great, good food, and great selection. A great place to stop for breakfast or lunch or smoothie. Wish they had more locations. For the amount of food you get it's worth the price, eating healthy isn't cheap, cost of meals isn't any difference if you bought food from Sprouts or Whole Foods. Ambience is nice and everyone is friendly/helpful. Highly recommend, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Another mediocre, WAY OVERPRICED joint on Indian School for the pretentious, millenial gym-bros to pay $20 for a \"healthy\" burger and sweet potato fries ($23.50 with a drink). Staffed by Phoenix's finest fast food workers. Do yourself a favor and pass on this superfluous, over-hyped Arcadia-fringe establishment...if it's even in business in the next year."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friend and I went for a hike and decided to get a protein shake afterwards. I was expecting a Jamba Juice type but I was surprised they had a full menu of breakfast, lunch, meal prep. Im definitely coming back to try the pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I'm a very clean eater, and they have premise options or make your own as well.  I had a bison bowl with veggies and the spicy salsa and it was delicious and not greasy at all.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try ProteinHouse for lunch today as their menu looked yummy online and I was having it delivered to my office.  I thought the Aloha chicken teriyaki burger sounded good and saw they have their own housemade teriyaki sauce...Well, once it arrived I saw the nice lean chicken and fresh pineapple; but hey where was the sauce?  NOT A DROP OF TERIYAKI SAUCE!   Absolutely, no dressing of ANY kind on either side of bun...dry as the desert burger is what I got!  No, it wasn't on the side or anywhere to be found...  HERE IS MY TWO CENTS WORTH OF ADVICE:  Don't offer take out if your not going to check the orders, and nothing for sweet potato bites??? Even McDonalds gives you sauces..."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and the food was great! I got the Steak and Spinach. Food was freshly made and I loved that. I will probably be here on the regular. Love this place."}
{"text":"My only regret is not getting the name of the girl who helped me. She was FANTASTIC- actually put me in a good mood. She guided me through the entire menu and was so excited about all the amazing options they have. The food far exceeded my standards at an AFFORDABLE price! Restaurant is clean and hip- super neat place. 

Girl with long hair and backwards hat- someone give that chick a raise!"}
{"text":"I've had different items on their menu and haven't had any complains. The staff has always been friendly and helpful with the question Ive had on the menu.  The inside has always been spotless clean. Recommend everyone to try it at least once.   Not the cheapest but definitely worth it"}
{"text":"The name is misleading...it should be \"healthy, tasty food that also has protein house\", lol.  Seriously, great salads, bowls and breakfasts.  Have not tried smoothies yet.  If you want a great option post workout, come here.  Love this concept."}
{"text":"Ordered food for 2, bill was 36.00. I don't pay that much for dinner out. The background music was hip hop this alone will cause me to not return. At breakfast I want to hear smooth jazz and nit the kind of music one might zumba to or that is filled with obscenities. The juice smoothy was good, I am waiting for the whey pancakes to arrive. Pancakes are good. But the music will drive me away from this place."}
{"text":"This place is great, great tasting food, awesome macros, quick and easy. Highly recommend the muscle freak shake"}
{"text":"I was super excited a new protein place was in our area. I stopped by after going to the gym. I was asked by the cashier if I had been there before, I said no and he handed me a menu. I'm allergic to nuts so I asked the cashier if I could get a chocolate protein shake without any nuts. He said yes and rang it in. I brought the menu to the table and was noticing all protein shakes there were made with almond milk. 
When my shake was ready I walked to the counter and asked if it was made with no nuts to make sure I was safe. The girl answered, \"no it's made with almond milk.\" I told her I wasn't able to have that because of my allergy. She was like, \"well did you even tell the cashier?\" I told her I did and she asked him and he shook his head no. She then responds, \"well I just want to know whose lying around here.\" She then proceeds to make a shake in 15 seconds. She brought it back to me and I even offered to pay for it cause she was having such a problem about the situation and she was like, \"no I think he just doesn't even know what almond milk is\" 
I was so upset about how the whole situation was handled by this woman. I work in the service industry and I completely understand bad days and that training can be hard but you have to remember that people do have allergies that can leave them super sick. I wish I could say I will return but that will not be the case."}
{"text":"Debated whether to give 2 or 3 stars.  Like others have said, for what you get it is expensive.  Order was messed up.  The food was just okay, not much flavor to the food, and nothing special."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. I've had a couple of salads and this morning tried the veggie omelette which was amazing. It's so nice to have a true healthy option close by. They list all the macros and there are a lot of options to customize, so vegan or vegetarian, no problem; low carb, no problem. There are several other \"healthy\" fast casual joints nearby. I put \"healthy\" in quotes because they don't provide any nutritional info which is highly suspect to me - enough that I won't go. Keep up the good work Protein House - see you soon!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here now on a regular basis (2-3 months) for my post or pre-workout protein shake. Would normally go to OneStop Nutrition for my Shake, they seem to be the pros in that department. ProteinHouse management should look at the efficiency, consistency, and friendly customer service provided at the OneStops.  (Protein Shake Business)

So here is my advice and experience for ProteinHouse. Your staff needs to up their Customer service game a notch or two for the prices you command, it is definitely a little off balance right now it seems. They are lacking a bit in terms of friendliness, prompt service, getting the orders out timely and efficiently to the CUSTOMER. I have experienced this on a very regular basis, and have had plenty of time watching them handle other customers, while waiting above normal times for my top of the market protein shake. A note to add, the place has never been busy during these moments, no excuses for this kind of marginal service. 

The final straw to bring me to write this type of review, is the lack of consistency of the same top dollar shake I order on a regular basis from the ProteinHouse. I do not mind paying the price I pay, but I do expect my shake to be the same thickness, flavor and consistency every time I decide to come here. I see the same employees make my shake all the time, this is a management and service problem. Is their no algorithm or consistent recipe, or standard measuring devices to make these shakes?  Are maybe your staff does not care to follow them or use the proper measuring devices on a consistent basis, therefor not caring about the product they are serving to your customers.

It is your front counter staffs actions driving this review. I hope you truly can review this as a training item with your team, and pay attention to the service your front staff is providing. I would like to see you guys be successful, I love your concept. I also think you can compete and kill it in the protein shake business, because the OneStops are doing just that killing it with their protein shake counters. Good Luck hope this helps and service on front side of the house gets dialed in soon. Hope it is only due to the bugs of a new location.

By the way, I did try their North Scottsdale location a few times awhile back for my protein shake, service was spot on and friendly every time. It should be the same experience at all locations."}
{"text":"My first visit to this establishment has left much to be desired. They claim to also be a coffeehouse but it was the worst Americano I have ever had. I threw it away. I tried the oatmeal which was too thick and dry. Service was very slow and less than friendly. The best part was that it was nice and quiet as the place was empty. Not a place I would recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"The quality of their food is really good. The quantity is filling and they stick true to their name and slogan. It's all about Protein!!! They also have Vegan Protein options available and awesome shakes and acai bowls. The staff is cool and I love the high energy vibe. Good music, spacious atmosphere, nice and clean. I love their culture and how they share it with customers by selling shirts, hats and other memorabilia."}
