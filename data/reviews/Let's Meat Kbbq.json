{"text":"First Korean BBQ place in Charlotte, finally!!! Been waiting for it! Marinated meats are good! King mushroom was fresh and clean. Staff are friendly and accommodating! We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Decided to come try Korean bbq for my 6 year anniversary with my boyfriend. When we first got there, (we were a couple minutes early) we were greeted by the managers who told us we had a couple minutes to wait, which we didn't mind. When they finally sat us down, our waitress came over and talked to us about what type of restaurant they were and helped us with everything we needed. She helped cook our meals for us, talked to us and just made us feel comfortable. Her personality was very bubbly and she was very attentive. A+ on the service! For the sides, we got all the tradition sides such as; kimchi, pickled radish, steamed bean sprouts, and all the other goodies! We ordered the garlic pork belly and the Bulgogi for our first tray of meats. Both were really great and I would have to say, my favorite! I also tried the spicy chicken, which honestly I wasn't too fond of. I felt like there was not enough flavor. We also ordered the corn and cheese on the random menu and to my surprise it was superb! The waitress suggested to eat it wrapped in lettuce and I did, it was good! One thing that I do find good but maybe bad to others is that, their portion is very small. I've had Korean bbq at other places and their meats come on a big tray versus this place delivers their meats in a small little side bowl. When we ordered the pork belly, it was only one piece, literally one slice of the pork belly. Its good because you can try different varieties of meat. But the downfall to that is, if I really like a certain type of meat, I have to keep reordering it. Other than that, I feel like everything was great! Definitely give it a try when you stop by!   On another note: I noticed that on their menu they are still adding more meats. So you are kind of limited."}
{"text":"The best thing since sliced bread! Seriously! It was an experience that I never thought I would partake in. Who goes to a restaurant to cook their own food??? Me! Lol. Although, there was a slight struggle in the beginning I felt like a pro chef by the end of the meal. The servers were more than helpful with explaining everything on the menu including how to cook the food throughout the complete dining experience. All of the meats were fresh with addition to having a great selection of sides. Im not a pork eater, but the other meat selections when cooked were delicious.  Expect a wait time upon arrival, I believe thats the only downfall but because there's a min 2hr dining time I can understand it. I will definitely be returning!  Try the rice wine!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place! They had helpful servers, and really nice owners who came by to check on us. The food was very good and authentic. I am looking forward to going back. They're off to a great start!"}
{"text":"So in Charlotte for my husband and I's six year anniversary. We thought we would do a nice fun day at Carowinds, and Charlotte!  Arrived a bit late to Charlotte and thought before heading to our Airbnb we would stop somewhere to do dinner. This place popped up on our yelp search and we thought we would give it a go since it had good reviews, was new, and near where we were staying. So glad we did! Absolutely no wait time which was great, and the waitress was super nice, telling us suggestions, and helping us out when she could tell we we're struggling. The price was 29.99 per person which was a bit pricy, but was basically all you could eat for two hours! We started out with pork belly and pork, with veggies and rice. It comes with like a sampler plate which had kimchi, picked radish,  potato salad, seaweed with red sauce as well as bean shoots and tons of other little sides, also had a yummy salad.  We then got bogogi, and shrimp.. by this time we were full! Our waitress gave us a hard time for tapping out early, but I think we did pretty good for two people who didn't plan on doing kbbq. Overall an awesome place for a date night, or a hangout with a group of buddies. I love kbbq it's such a fun and unique experience!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to finally have a decent kbbq place in Charlotte. Food options were solid, though deducted a star for no ayce option for kalbi like in other places.   Service is 5 stars though which is a nice change for kbbq (shout out to Green!). They're fast in bringing out your orders and pro active in stopping to see how the table is doing. Nice change of pace compared to many other places.  Glad to have an option I'd be happy to go to without needing to go to Atlanta or DC area."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ has always been one of my favorite meal experiences. It's fun when it's done well and Let's Meat does KBBQ GREAT.  I've been a huge fan of Seoul Food next door since I moved to Charlotte so when I heard they were opening up a sister kbbq place RIGHT BESIDE Seoul, I got super excited. I thought, \"How could this not be a slam dunk?\"   I was right.  LET'S MEAT IS FREAKIN AWESOME. I'm sure everything I've said has been said before so I'll keep this short.  First of all, they have a rotating slideshow on the wall that helps put a word to everything you'll see throughout your meal. That's sides and meats. Very helpful!  It's $30 for AYCE and my god can you feast at this place. Our server was bringing meat out at record pace and was extremely helpful since it was our first time there.  The sides they bring you are all delicious, the salad, the rice, the cheese corn. It's ALL good.   Favorite cuts of meat were the bulgogi and the thinly sliced pork. Garlic pork wasn't too great, way fatty and not a ton of flavor. Everything else was spot on, though. If you've got a group of 4 or 6 and you're all wanting to do something a little different then the usual sushi or gastropub thing, Let's Meat is a really fun experience you'll all enjoy. And get super full."}
{"text":"This was honestly one of the best meals I've had in a while. There are tons of neat, delicious, places to eat around the Queen City, but Let's Meat KBBQ is definitely in the top tier.  We arrived at the restaurant around 8:30 Saturday night and they said it would be about a thirty to forty minute wait before we could be seated. Not ideal, but it was the weekend and the place was packed. Undeterred we decided to walk up the block to Unknown Brewery to kill some time and were happily surprised to get our \"ready to be seated\" text earlier than expected (maybe twenty five minutes?). We made our way back and were promptly shown to our table.  Walking past the counter in to the dining area you can really appreciate the look of the place. Super simple, super clean, just enough character. The walls are about 80% just plain white stone, but there are a few super colorful Asian themed murals scattered about. One wall (right behind our table) also had a projector with what seemed to be a little how to video for the tabletop grills. The seating itself and the table dividers are unstained clear coated wood and the tables seem to be granite with a just bigger than dinner plate sized flat top grill in the middle.   We were quickly greeted by our wonderful waiter Green (yes like the color) who took our drink orders and began to explain the menu and process for ordering and cooking everything. Our drinks came out quickly along with all the accouterments for the meal. Salad, perfectly cooked rice, Kim chi, no less than four different sauces, radish, corn cheese bowls, marinated tofu, lettuce wraps and a few different sprouts. They really want to make sure you have options once the meat hits the table, and hit the table it did.  We tried so many wonderful things it's hard to keep track of it all. We started with the Standard Pork Belly. If you like a nice fatty piece of bacon this will be heaven for you, and since you're in charge of cooking your own food, you can make it as just as crispy as you want. (We also tried the garlic pork belly and wine pork belly!) Then it was time for the Spicy Chicken. Really flavorful but honestly not as good as their other options. The true gems though were of the cow variety. The Fatty Beef Brisket was outstanding. Super thin slices of wonderfully marbled meat, just sear, dip and enjoy. It was almost like if you took the thinly sliced/shaved meat off of a philly cheesesteak and dipped it into a world of wonderful Korean flavors.  I thought it couldn't get any better than the brisket, then we ordered the Beef Bulgogi. Oh boy. You can't go wrong with any of the items we tried, but the Beef Bulgogi is something you can sit down and get lost in the flavor of, and easily lose track of how much you've eaten. It's sort of similar to the brisket in appearance, thin (though not super thin) pieces of meat, but you can tell the difference in smell as soon as it hits the grill. The Bulgogi is marinated in a variation of the house sauce (one of the four you get with all your sides and things) and it is so damn delicious. I'm not sure if the meat is just more tender from the marinade, or the sauce really is just that delicious, but I could order nothing save for that one item and be perfectly happy. Those tiny pieces of beef are truly worth the price of admission.  This dinner was such a wonderful experience. Green always kept our drinks full, made sure our food always came out quickly and had no problem providing some friendly chit-chat along the way. I haven't had an overall dining experience this pleasant in some time. I imagine some might be turned off by the price but it really is worth every penny. The amount and quality of food provided, along with the wonderful staff and atmosphere makes this place a real treasure. Please, do yourself a favor and come visit this place. You will be so glad you did."}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. This is not a Korean restaurant! The dishes have korean names but that's where the similarity ends. The side dishes, soups and meats were all below acceptable standards.  The \"octopus\" was squid.  The \"fatty beef\" Chadelbagi was tasteless and unrecognizable because of the way it was cut. Bulgogi was far too salty. Mushrooms dry, etc., etc. $30 for all you can eat would usually indicate you can eat it! For $30 you can eat like a king at a real Korean restaurant. My wife is Korean. She rated this the worst Korean food she's ever been served.  I've eaten Korean food all over the the Americas and Asia. Paraquay has better Korean."}
{"text":"So let me tell you a little bit about this restaurant. 6 or more people require you to pay a 18% gratuity. It will be $30 a person, for all you can eat buffet. They will not seat you until everybody arrives. Once you are sitting at the table, you will be able to order 3 meats at a time. They will also tell you that you can cook the food yourself. Now we cooked some of it but we had sever cook most of it because I was like, why am I paying $30 to cook my own food. Do not order more meat than you think you'll be able to eat, because any uncooked meat left, they will add a 10% surcharge to your bill. You can't take any food with you. You'll have two hours to eat, so pace yourself.  In the end, we enjoyed ourselves, and the food was good. The egg souffle is an must try. I mixed my egg souffle with my rice, and also added some of the meats and shrimp.  The miso soup was good as well. It was a little spicy, which I like.  This place will make a perfect spot for a first date because it will allow you to talk with your date while your food is cooking right in front of you."}
{"text":"Our experience was great!! For their second day being open, we are very impressed. We had no idea what we were doing and every single staff member came to help us!! The fatty beef brisket, thinly sliced beef and corn cheese were our favorites! The  manager was super friendly and helpful and made us feel welcomed and at home. Definitely take your time and try everything, we will be back! Lee Lee and David really made our experience amazing, thank you guys!"}
{"text":"5/21/2018,    My husband Adrian & I (Jackie) went for the first time to Let's Meat KBBQ. Let me start off by saying; what a phenomenal eating experience and ambiance! They were playing EDM that day and we love EDM! We absolutely loved Misaki, she was so knowledgeable about the menu and recommended delicious menu items! She had us try Seju (Soju in English) and it was amazing! She was so sweet and was training another waitress there named Zina (you have a good teacher Zina). Kara, the restaurant manager, frequently checked on us and we kept assuring her that everything was great! All in all, I recommend this place to anyone that loves some good korean food. I will say the only downside is not many items to choose from yet (as we were assured more items will come in the future), but definitely worth the atmosphere and customer service you receive. We will definitely be making repeat visits. Hope you all get to experience what we experienced!"}
{"text":"Great. I am excited to see what other meats will join the menu as they grow. The wait was long but worth it. I wasn't greeted when I came in and I had to figure out on my own that there is a list up front with an eraseable marker to write my name and phone number on. I didn't find this method very effective and hope they find a more efficient one. I would recommend arriving at a decent time. At a certain point they have to cut off any other customers that come in due to the nature of the restaurant offering all you can eat for 2 hours.  The dipping sauces were good. The house sauce is the best. Then you have sesame oil and hot dipping sauce and paste. A large variety of sides included. I tried all of the beef, pork belly, and chicken. We also got the kalbi which is extra. It was so tasty that we considered it the dessert for the night.  Generous portions as well as all you can eat sides. We got an extremely nice waitress. Since we were one of the last people sat, she gave us a lot of attention and cooked our meats for us since we were her only table. Traditionally you are supposed to cook your own meat so they may not do this on a busier night.  Overall it was a decent experience. I'd like to see some Kobe or wagyu added to make things even more interesting. The atmosphere was a little loud as large parties were drinking. The music was a little out of place since it was almost like electronic or club music. Something more traditional would add to the experience."}
{"text":"I came to eat here about a month ago, they have a few rules such as; you can only stay for a maximum of 2 hours, you can't take food to go, and it's $30 per person but that's for all you can eat so depending on who you are it may or may not be a good deal for you. My server was very nice and a few other servers I spoke to were also nice and friendly. I love the bulgogi and pork meat. This is a place you have to try at least once, if you don't know what you're doing the server helps you and will even stand at your table and cook the meat for you."}
{"text":"Great Service, Lots of tasty sides, great meal for conversation. Dipping sauces are great! End the meal with the banana fermented wine!"}
{"text":"Wow.    I won't say \"if\" you go. You MUST/WILL go. And when you do please ask for Stephen. He made this experience absolutely fantastic. One of the best servers I have ever had at ANY restaurant.  The food was outrageous and atmosphere was great too. I highly recommend this place.  The kalbi beef was out of this world. So many different and wonderfully flavored pork belly options. The ribeye was delicious. Please get over the \"I don't want to cook my own food at a restaurant \" thing and go out with friends to have an amazing experience. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Korean BBQ! The food was delicious and there are several choices to chose from! They are very friendly and the waiters are extremely kind and helpful to those who are new to the Korean BBQ! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for their grand opening and was surprised at how authentic it is. They are located at south end of Charlotte next to their sister restaurant Seoul Food Meat Co. Parking was a little tight so you may have to do some walking which was no problem to me. They had murals with an Asian Zen and their setup was very modern with wooden benches and coffee colored marble tables with, of course, a deep stove in the middle to cook your foods. This isn't my first time having Korean BBQ so I was wondering how their setup and food would taste. It's an all you can eat $30.00 a person and $12.00 for kids ages 4-10 with a 2-hour limit. That's understandable since the place is a bit small so they don't need people hanging around when others are waiting. They have a great selection of domestic and local beers plus Korean soju! They don't have a big meat selection yet but it's KBBQ so the basics are just beef and pork, if you ever had KBBQ before. They have a variety of side dishes and I love Korean side dishes, especially kimchi and their kimchi was great! Bryan was our waiter and he was welcoming and very tentative even though they were slammed. I had a great time and ate as much as I can - I was feeling the itis after LOL. I will definitely come back and can't wait for more selections on their menu. Continue the great work guys! This will probably be a successful Korean BBQ in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came for a second time today and it wasn't even a weekend and it was pretty busy! THEY ADDED MORE OPTIONS TO THEIR MENU!!!   The seafood options are on point, and the squid is extremely fresh. My family loved the squid and we ordered multiple rounds. Their marination for the beef still amazes me, as it is so well seasoned. I wish some of the pork belly options had a more strong flavor from the marination. It's very subtle and a stronger sense of flavor would be awesome.   I can't wait to see what new options they'll be adding to their menu! A spicy squid option would be pretty dank... Whatever they choose to add, I'm sure it won't disappoint!   Our waiter was so sweet and quick on his feet. The staff is amazing and I think why everything works so well is because they have such a good sense of teamwork in this place. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Let's Meat is a GO-TO when talking about Korean BBQ. The wait staff is attentive and prompt when the need arises.  Service was seamless and we were attended by no less than 8 staff members!  We literally wanted for nothing! Good variety of meats making Let's Meat a definite must eat.    When to get there= EARLY!!! (opens at 430 and fills up quickly) Where to wait= their sister restaurant on the same property has a nice patio bar and they'll call you when your table is ready. What to order= Lemon Pork belly & Bulgogi act as co-stars of the show.  Don't forget to order a few sides of veggies...  I find it best to place the veggies around the perimeter of the grill, place a few pieces of pork belly near the center;  allowing them to crackle, smoke and sear accordingly- the beautiful juices flow down onto the veggies & help cook them."}
{"text":"This is what we've been waiting for - Moving down from California we were sad to notice that North Carolina didn't have KBBQ, at least the grill in front of you type not the food type. This place has good options nothing to special though, but the customer service here is spectacular. Occasionally forgot one or two things we order but they are really packed most of the time."}
{"text":"This restaurant would be better if their staff had better customer service training. The hostess/cashier (the Korean one with the chubby cheeks) made me want to leave as soon as I walked in. NOT someone you want greeting your first-time customers! I walked in with two small children (ages 3 and 7) and my 84 year old grandmother to get a table while my sister parked the car. When I requested a table for five, she tells us she will seat us as soon as the fifth person comes in. We ask why we can't just be seated now, that the other person will be in shortly, and she tells \"Ok, but we'll start your clock for 2 hours\". Seriously? What is this, a buffet?? Even if we were seated without the rest of our party being there, we would need a few minutes to look at the menu, the order to come out, and the food to cook so that would cut into our time anyway. What she said and especially HOW she said it was completely unnecessary and only turned us off from wanting to eat there. We wouldn't stuff our faces for 2 hours ANYWAY! It doesnt matter how good the food is (which was average, btw) if the staff sucks. People want to go where they feel welcome! I'd give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"We went for lunch right after they opened and we didn't not have to wait to be seated. We were seated right away and our server Linda was fantastic, very friendly and helped explain the menu very thoroughly! There service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. We ordered almost everything off the menu and requested more sides as well. They were definitely not stingy on the amount of meat they gave you or the amount of times you could order sides either. Our server had our grill switched out about 3x just to keep our food from burning from each different flavor of sauce, they were definitely on top of that. Linda checked on us every so often to make sure we were still enjoying everything. I couldn't have asked for a better server! We will be coming again and definitely requesting her again!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty decent Korean bbq restaurant! I'm Korean so I've been to many aaaaall over the country, so I can't say this is even on my top 10. The meat & banchans were good, not great. BUT! Korean BBQ is all about marinated short ribs (galbi) and pork belly (samgyupsal). I found it absurd and even upsetting that they charge $13.99 for galbi. Galbi should be standard, it's literally the definition of Korean BBQ. There are many different types of pork dishes, but even the pork bulgogi isn't your standard Korean pork bulgogi...it's not spicy; I just found that odd! It was worth going for the experience, but I'd rather buy galbi & samgyupsal from G-Mart or Peppero and make them myself for the money I spent here!"}
{"text":"**BEWARE** You have to cook your own food.Lol  With that being said. I have never been to a Korean bbq so I wasn't sure what to expect.. Overall I wish I would've waited to the hype dies down. For Saturday, it was 1.5 hrs wait. By the time I got seated I was hangry and about to die of thirst. Zah was a lot of help. He tried to explain the whats and how's but due to the music being sooo loud and I left my hearing aids at home. So It's a lost cause. Lucky my cousin took over. So here's my overall view:   FOOD: 4/5 some are good and some is a miss. The Kim Chi was a yum and I have never been a fan of those.. tofu was a nooo. I'm confuse. The curry meat was ok..  SERVICE: 5/5 Zah (waiter) and David aka manager tried to help us cook the food. But it was overwhelmingly busy so they were hoping from table to table.  AMBIANCE: 3/5 I understand it's a Saturday night. But I feel like overall cooking the meats is a good place to socialize with your friends. So with the music being sooo loud, it drown out our conversations. So we don't have a choice but to eat and nods at each other for whatever is being said and hope that's the right nod!   Special NOTE: there's a 2 hrs limit per table. From what Zah said. It's more like a courtesy thing for the next customers. You don't want to sit, eat and marinate (socialize) when there's a whole line of ppl waiting. I understand that.  But when I look at these type of set up. I wouldn't want to be rush. Cooking and socializing with friends goes together. Just my thought! So I'll keep that 2 hrs limit in mind the next time I dine here. If I want to really socialize with the girls. This place wouldn't be my choices"}
{"text":"Always on point. Brought some first timers and they loved it. Fresh meat and banchan all-day! Manager was so attentive to our tables. Definitely will be back! And open for lunch!! No lines and everything was available"}
{"text":"So good. Didnt eat all day to make sure I had room. Eat everything. The tounge was awesome. Loved the picked treats and sauces. Great service."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place out and it finally happened. I've read so many reviews and have friends saying good things about this place that I had to check it out. The wait is kind long so my husband and I decided to go early.  We got there around 6:30 and were advise the wait would take around 45 minutes. I was wondering how long the wait is if you get there around 7:30ish??? Probably over an hour but I can tell you in advance that it is totally worth it! The good thing is they get your number and call when your table is ready so you don't have to wait there.  In the waiting area they have a big screen that explain how everything works and it is pretty easy actually.  Our table was ready for us around 30 minutes after our arrival.  Our waiter Zach was really nice and helpful. He explain how everything worked and made suggestions about the menu.  I had a Korean grape juice that was delicious and we had many different kinds of meat that night.  Our favorite was beef brisket! The place was clean, the service was really good, the food did not take long to get to us and is all you can eat, so if you love good food like us this is the place for you!  They have a two hour limit once you order but you will be done probably before that. Love the place, love the food. Can't wait to go back! !!!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  I think most charlottes have never had Korean bbq before.  It's below average quality in Asia.  And they trick the customers by controlling space of ordering.  It's not all you can eat at all."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars for customer service and finally a Korean style place. I loved the corn cheese. I put it in my mushrooms I grilled. The brisket was great. My boyfriend loved the sauce so much he asked for a large portion.  My second favorite was the spicy chicken. We got squid, shrimp, veggies, mushrooms, PORK BELLY :) We will def be back!  Alcohol menu didn't have a lot of wine."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first bc ever one says you have to cook your own food and paying to cook my own food doesn't sit well with me.  After we were sat we were quickly greeted by Peter and he took all of the confusion away!  Not only was he very helpful in making decisions but he cooked all of the options we chose and they were delicious!  We started out simply ordering the Pork Belly and Brisket. After that we told Peter to surprise us and that he did!  The Beef Chunks are by far the best thing we had along with the traditional Bulgogi.  Great place to bring out of town friends or just something different for your dinner option.  Loved it and will return!"}
{"text":"FINALLLLLLLY  CHARLOTTE HAS REAL KOREAN BBQ  we have prayed for it and demanded it for years on in. Tired of driving 3.5 hours to atlanta to get some real Korean bbq. It has arrived and it's nothing short of greatness for that kbbq fix. All you can eat meat and sides for less than 30 bucks. The only down fall that I can say they have as of right now is not opening for lunch but it's still new so kinks are expected. Plus there's a lot of hype and excitement with it so there is gonna be a wait for a table, but it is worth the wait. If you've never had Korean bbq you are missing out on true flavor greatness. Something about cooking your meat and taking it right off the grill cooked at your own person preference  and cramming it  into your mouth one bite at a time is simply perfection lol \"caution don't burn your tongue \" all the flavors that you expect on the meat marinades and sides are all there. Let's meat kbbq did a really good job at not leaving nothing out, and doing it the right way for Charlotte. I been a vegetarian for a few months now and I broke that just for this! Welcome to Charlotte and welcome to North Carolina Korean bbq! The Home of american bbq where eastern bbq and western bbq sauce as been battling out on who's sauce is better. Sorry Carolinians KOREAN BBQ JUST WON THE TITLE! I recommend you going right at 4:30 to guarantee a table, if not, you gonna get tired of waiting for one bc they stay busy!"}
{"text":"I can't lie... I don't know why you would go anywhere else if you wanted a ton of meat with an Asian flair. Let's Meat is Charlotte's first true Korean BBQ joint and it has been met which an overwhelmingly positive lot of feedback. This is due to a extensively well trained front of house, who understand that the vast majority of their customers are unfamiliar with this cuisine. Follow that up with an amazing back of house that make the concept inviting and easy to understand, this is key to getting people to step out of their comfort zone and try something new!  Tuesday night was the night. I figured it wouldn't be too crazy on a Tuesday, boy was I wrong. The hype has already spread around the hive and they were slammed. Surprisingly, while there were a few large parties waiting for a big table, they were able to seat me and my girlfriend immediately. The consensus among most reviews is that the service is outstanding. Indeed, they have a ton of people running around tending to every table. Dedicated Food Runners bringing out the sides, sauces, and meat. Servers who are really well versed in explaining the process. If it's you're first time they'll walk you through the menu and even cook your first few servings of meat, as well as continuously check in on your meats once you've taken the reins.  My god, not only was it easy, it was damn delicious. A lot of places around the QC that have pork belly either serve it with a generous amount that has no sear, or use the thinnest or cheapest cuts they can get. Genuinely great pork belly is hard to come by around here, but this kBBQ grill is perfect for it. Super thick cuts and all you can eat, you'll get a slight bit of char with a perfect, golden-brown sear if you do it right. The best part, you can flip your meat as many times as you want and it doesn't change the outcome at all. The whole concept is super fun.  Along with the meats, you'll get all kinds of other great additions to dinner like kimchi, steamed bean sprouts, plenty of rice, pickled daikon radish, seaweed salad, and my personal favorite: garlic stems! The stems are cooked down and served with this light, slightly sweet red sauce that is wonderful. You'll get some lettuce to make your own wacky wrap combinations as well.  Our server and 'instructor' Tim was just fantastic. Every extra side we wanted was brought within seconds and he showed us all the tricks of the trade to make the most out of the new concept. Another guy named David also stopped by and showed us his take on using different ingredients together to make delicious bites of meaty goodness. These people really want you leaving with a smile and to get that 'wow' factor.  They have a few slots on their menu labeled 'coming soon' so I can't wait to see what else they have in store. Right now they have beef, pork belly, chicken, veggie plates, and kalbi (short ribs) which is actually the only plate you'll pay extra for. We didn't try the short ribs because of the incredible value you get from the standard fixed price.  I can't recommend this place enough. $30 per person, plus your drink, and you'll be in meat heaven. Only a couple of blocks from the Bland St. light rail station, it's super convenient and super fun! We'll be back with the whole fam next time!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this Korean bbq place open and with great reviews. We just got to try it. The food is delicious and the servers are so kind! Even though we have been to Kbbq in bigger cities, I'm glad that they opened one near by. Cravings satisfied.  $29.99 per person with a 2 hour dining limit. It's worth it!  We definitely recommend it! Can't wait to come back!  Sowell"}
{"text":"Excellent! 5 Star! Love the selction and highly recommend the bull-go-gi!!!! Come with a group or a couple and settle in for a treat.   Note: parking is hard to come by but worth the hunt."}
{"text":"Repeatedly ordered: fatty beef brisket, beef tongue, thinly sliced beef, beef chunks, king oyster mushroom (cook it with pork belly), egg soufflé, and green leaf lettuce to go with meats. And the sauces needed refills frequently.   Tried some varieties of pork belly. Tastes good but not impressed.   Loved these Ban Chan (small plates of appetizers): kimchi, potato salad, pickled daikon radish (to go with meats and lettuce leaves)  Only downside: it's so popular that you have to go before 6 to avoid ridiculously long waiting time on the weekdays, and before 4:15 on the weekends (yes, wait in line even before it opens)"}
{"text":"Took our mother there for her birthday and we all enjoyed it.  Great food and easy set up.  Tried the brisket, bulgogi, pork belly and their side dishes were good as well.  Atmosphere was nice."}

At Let's Meat Kbbq, there is a flat rate for you to eat all your heart desires but it is structured in a way that decreases the potential for unnecessary waste. So essentially, the idea is that you order from a menu for portions of things whether it be meat, vegetables, soups, etc and if you want more, you can always order more. Honestly, some people might not be excited about the \"inconvenience\" about ordering multiple times but I'm happy with it because I've oftentimes wondered and reflected about the waste! Also, the waiters/waitresses are so attentive that anytime you need anything, they're right there to take your order. Furthermore, they do all the cooking for you, so all you need to do is eat. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the fact that the price per person is already pretty steep. It seems a little ridiculous to have to pay an additional amount for some of the meats. I won't speak much to the authenticity. I didn't particularly think the meats were flavored well though the bean paste soup was exactly as how I remember my mother making it when I was a wee lass. Lastly, I was really glad that their kimchi was good- it's the first thing I look for when I go to a Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Exactly what Charlotte has been needing!  I could not wait to until this place opened and made sure I was there on their grand opening.  Located right beside Soul Meat, the parking I can see being an issue on the weekends when they are probably the busiest but there seems to be a lot of street parking.  Once the doors were finally open for business, the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Giving out menus to review before we were seated and answering questions. Even though it was grand opening day it was not overcrowded and we did not have to wait for a table. There are plenty of tables and many are able to accommodate large parties which is great.  Once we were seated at our table our grill was immediately lighted by one of the staff and our server came over to explain the process and start putting in orders for our table. We received all Banchans (side dishes) that are used in Korean BBQ and all of them were fresh and tasted amazing. At $30 a hour per person, we ordered almost every meat on the menu. Don't let the $30 a hour per person discourage or alarm you. I have been to authentic Korean restaurants in Korea and a few in the States and this is probably the best deal because ordering a la carte at other restaurants can really start adding up and kind of leave you still feeling hungry.  Our favorite meats we ordered was the Pork belly, thin and original and the fatty beef brisket. We ordered the spicy chicken but we did not really enjoy it, it was a little too spicy and really no flavor besides that. We loved having both options of rice and lettuce to eat with our meat and side dishes. I don't believe we even got close to the 2 hour limit, we probably only ate for a hour because the serve was so great. We always quickly received our new order of meat for the grill and side dishes.  Having been to Korea and trying to find a restaurant that was similar to the authentic Korean BBQ we had in Korea, Let's Meat by far has been the closest thing to what we had in Korea. The concept of cooking your own food and ordering what you like for a flat rate I'm sure will be very popular as the word gets out about the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been saying for a few years that Charlotte needed a KBBQ place. Finally, we have one. Everything about my dinner here was good. We got there at 5-515 on a Friday. They will not seat you until everyone in your party arrives. We were waiting on our third person and finally got seated at 530. I recommend going early to catch the first seating or expect a wait. Our server, Alex, was quick to greet us and take our drink orders. She also took our first orders of meet. Somewhere in the she also explained the cooking method and the sides they bring. It's all you can eat with a time limit of 2 hrs. Let's just say, we ate a lot. They will bring whatever you ask for, honestly at one point, I think I had to tap out. The manager come by several times, he even helped cook for us a few times and provided additional instruction. His wife, the owner, also stopped by the table to say hello. They have soju, a variety of flavors which while we didn't try them all, we did several bottles. They are small and like in S. Korea, it's more of shot type thing. All in all, we were there right at 2 hrs, although we stopped eating at probably 1.5 hrs. Overall, based on my handful of KBBQ experiences both in the states and in S. Korea, I'd say they do a great job. This concept is great for groups too. It's an experience. I definitely recommend Let's Meat! I give the owners props for bringing something totally different to Charlotte. A BIG THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"So it looks like Charlotte finally got Korean BBQ, and it's about time.  If you have no idea what KBBQ is, it's basically a hot pot but for grilled meat. If you don't know what Hot Pot is, think of a do it yourself BBQ. When I'm talking about DIY BBQ, I mean, they give you raw meat and you put it on the grill and you bbq for yourself. I think Let's Meat is actually doing it right in a new market though. However saying that, I do think that there are some things that they still have to iron out.  First up, getting seated. We're standing in line waiting for a table, and we know that we have 2 people coming along however we're already there and want to sit down. Instead of waiting for the whole party to be there, let us get seated, because what if the tables fill up? I get it, the 2-hour time limit once you sit down starts as soon as we get seated and it wouldn't be fair for those who come along after. I can see that if it gets really busy and there's only one person with a party of 6, yeah okay, I guess because the restaurant wants to maximize profits. But, if a majority of the party shows up why can't they sit? Start the time, and kick them out at 2 hours whether or not all of them are there or not, it's not the staff's fault for their party not being there on time. Plus, the BBQ portion still takes time to cook anyways so that gives it more reason to just seat those that are there already.  I do think that the staff is doing an excellent job on educating people on what KBBQ is. Especially in this market, there are those that have no idea what it is and could feel intimidated especially coming from an environment when everything is already done when served. I thought our waiter was amazing at explaining and demonstrating how to cook/kbbq. Even though he didn't need to, I think he was in the mode of explaining so I just let him do his script that he basically came up with from serving X amount of tables.   **When ordering: PORK BELLY IS 1 PIECE per ORDER.** My experiences in KBBQ usually 1 order is like 3 pieces or sometimes 4. However, Let's Meat speaks a different language. One order of let's say pork belly, means literally, one piece. So if you're thinking oh, let's get X amount of pork belly, just order the amount. For beef brisket, it's really thin so don't feel bad for thinking you're \"over ordering.\"  I think that didn't come out until I ordered. If I would have known I would've ordered 5-6 orders of pork belly from the start.  Sauces: Let's Meat comes up a little short on this. We asked simply for some soy sauce to dip our meat into, and the staff responded that they didn't have any. But, when they served the side dishes, guess what one of those dishes had? Yeah, soy sauce. So, if you don't have any soy sauce, how? So, if you're looking to want to dip your meats into something, I would definitely recommend you to bring your own sauce in. They don't judge or say you can't, so that's definitely a tip on that end. Now, please don't bring in like A1 or Ketchup to dip your KBBQ meat in, I'm talking on the realm of fish sauce, or chili sauce that you want to dip.  Alcoholic Beverages: Let's Meat has them. If you've never had flavored Soju...you're in for a treat if you go down that route. Just drink responsibly, because most likely you won't know what hit you until you stand up.  Time Limit: 2 hours is technically plenty of time to eat. If you're worried about that, order more at the beginning so you have it cooking. However, this is one limitation that affected me because even though I know 2 hours is plenty of time, it still gives me anxiety when I'm eating and I just don't like that feeling. In my experience at other KBBQ restaurants, I don't really think about time and in the back of my mind repeating: \"We have to eat faster and order more or they'll kick us out!\" I know we were done within the 2 hours, but still I think this would be my biggest hesitation on coming here to eat again.  Overall: Let's Meat isn't bad. The price point of $29.99 per person, and depending on what you order it could be more. We ordered the Kalbi, because I mean, that's what you should get, at least to try out. If you don't know what it is, let's just say it's on the sweet side, but it's really tasty and can become dangerous to increasing that bill. Still if you've never had it, it's something to get. I would definitely come back when the market of KBBQ settles down a bit. But if you have never been here and you want to know what the hype is about, go for it because it's not 4 hours away like it used to be when I grew up and lived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had an extremely friendly and delicious experience when I went for the first time to any traditional korean bbq place."}
{"text":"We almost didn't come because of the negative reviews. The food and service was amazing. Green was our server and we never had to wait for more food. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"I may not be the best person to review the authenticity of the Korean BBQ but I can say that I enjoyed the experience overall mainly because it was a great venue to entertain a large group.  We had eight people so it was a full two tables.  I enjoyed the different meats and thought they were decent quality and the selection was solid with the options of Ribeye, chicken, shrimp, and pork belly.  All of it fresh but as you know you have to cook it yourself .  Overall a good experience but a little pricey for what you actually get and I probably will go back at some point but not for a while.  I also felt frustrated with the seasonings on the meat and a lot of times was missing out because I lack the experience with which Korean spices I like the best.  This issue left much of the meat sort of bland and forgettable which is a shame.   Value:  4/10 Service:  10/10 Food:  7/10 Ambiance:  8/10"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Korean bbq to open in Charlotte for a long time. Finally it is here. Great service, super fast, super welcoming. Good variety of meat, considering they just opened and the menu is not even full yet. Perfect place to go with your friends and have some fun and good food with soju. Oh, and the music is awesome!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The Korean BBQ is amazing as well as the atmosphere. Our waiter was informative and helped us with all of our questions and needs.  Everyone should try this place."}
{"text":"Delish. Do wish waiters would slow down a bit, but food delish!! Order lettuce leaves and make everything a lettuce wrap w rice, Meat, sauce and \"relish\" stuff...yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Our server was knowledgeable and attentive, explained the menu very well and talked us through all of our options. We liked the soy chicken and the brisket the best, the egg soufflé side was also really really good. Make sure you eat what you have before you order more, you'd be surprised how full you get while eating in between orders! Definitely a place you go to eat at knowing you and your food baby won't be leaving the couch for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I rarely find Korean BBQ places with beef tongue (????on their menu and omg this makes my soul happy! They meat quality was high and the banchan options were amazing! Everything I ate was of such high quality and I was sad when I had to leave (we hit 2 hours exactly which is the limit).  The best part wasn't the food however, it was the amazing service this place provided. I would eat the bean sprouts and then later get sad because I had forgotten to order more, BUT WHEN I LOOKED DOWN IT HAD BEEN REPLENISHED, AS IF MAGIC    Please don't sleep on Let's Meat, because their service would never sleep on you."}
{"text":"With the lack of good Korean BBQ in Columbia, SC., this place is a godsend, even though it's an hour and a half away from me. Service was fantastic and the atmosphere great.  They have a ll the basics as well as some specialties such as pork belly marinated with different sauces/spices. They also have galbi, but it's at an additional cost which kind of sucks... Also, the portions they give the meat at are kind of small, but I get that they're trying to reduce food waste. The great service makes up for it though, as we ordered all that we wanted without waiting much.  It's all-you-can-eat only so be weary of that. If you're in Charlotte and you're hungry, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Korean BBQ and it was fabulous!  It's an all you can eat in 2 hours and it was great!  I love how we eat the food right out of the stove!  So hot and fresh and the bulgogi is nicely marinated where I didn't even need any sauce.  The meats were definitely nice and fresh.  It's a fun atmosphere along with fine dining!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try this place out as we haven't had any experience with Korean food. We decided to go on a late afternoon on a Sunday. The wait was about 45 minutes for us, but that's more due to the amount of time it takes to actually eat here.   This is an order, cook your own food, order some more, repeat the cycle style restaurant. They have a great selection of meats to choose from and although they had several sides, we didn't eat many. The meat was the main attraction and it was awesome!  Our waiter was great at explaining everything to us and also helping us get started. We had the pork belly and the brisket to start off. Both were amazing. Then we tried the squid, bulgogi and soy chicken. Those were also very good. We ended it with some shrimp and more pork belly. The brisket was my favorite overall.   There are a variety of sauces that they bring you to go with the meats. I liked 2 out of the 4. The lettuce we ordered to go with the meats were also enjoyable. There are videos playing at the front and in the main dinning area that explain how to cook and eat the food. By the time we left, we felt like pros.   It's all you can eat, so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"I love Korean bbq! And when I want it I would have to drive to GA for it because of the big Korean Community. So I was super excited this place opened in Charlotte. It's $30 person all you can eat for 2hrs. But I was disappointed. For $30, I wanted some seafood and more cuts of meat. All that was on the menu was beef and pork and 1 chicken option. Pork belly marinated in different sauce were mostly the choices. The veggie plate came with only 3 kinds of veggie: onion, zucchini,and carrots. Little side dishes were ok only  but I loved the salad. I probably won't return. But if you like to experienced Korean bbq with the drive to GA. Give it a go."}
{"text":"An updated trendy homage to KBBQ. Good quality meat. VERY ATTENTIVE servers. Charlotte-eans looking for something different and get their feet wet into some Korean food, KBBQ is the gates to our yummy cuisine. The banchan can be better, but for what your getting AYCE is worth it at its price."}
{"text":"Me and my gf went on there for her bday and waited for 3 hours. Right when we were about to get seated, someone poured alcohol on one of the grills and they all shut down. They ended up closing the restaurant early and we never got seated. The only thing they offered was 15% off at a DIFFERENT restaurant. Worst customer service ever honestly. Won't ever go there or Seoul Food Meat Co. and try them out just because of this experience."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with Korean BBQ and it did not disappoint. We loved everything we tried and we were able to try tons of different things! All the meat is good but we also loved the cheese corn and egg soufflé. Totally give it a try for a fun date night spot."}
{"text":"Let's Meat did not disappoint! Totally worth the $30 per person for all you can eat Korean bbq for 2 hours?! Our server Alexandria was wonderful and attentive and so was the rest of the staff! My family and I will definitely be coming back as often as we can! It was such a fun and authentic experience grilling your own meats and vegetables! Definitely get there early so you won't have to wait long! Loved the pork belly, corn cheese, beef tongue was amazing and the beef chucks were definitely my favorite!!! I didn't take any pictures of the meat on the grill because I was wayyyyy to excited and busy enjoying the great food! The sides were awesome delicious! Awesome kimchi, salad, pickled veggies and a great selection of sauces! If you love Korean food come to Let's Meat, it is definitely going to be one of Charlotte's best restaurants!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, although the wait on the weekends are pretty long, it's so worth it! The staff are so friendly and check on you all the time! The food is great and comes in small convenient portions so you don't get full fast! My waiter's name was Green! He was so nice and informed us on how the menu worked! I 100% will be returning!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Outstanding service! A new go to place for all things Korean and yummy!"}
{"text":"Please do better!  You're the *only* AYCE Korean bbq in Charlotte and you should set a high standard.  This review is going to be honest and straightforward, as I've eaten at quite a few Korean BBQ places in Cali, NY, NJ and FL where I have lived  Service- very good. The wait staff is on point, food came out rather quickly. Very attentive to our needs (and there wasn't many), accommodating and receptive.   Atmosphere- it's located next to its sister restaurant so they share the same modern-esque concrete wall and industrial look.  It was a little loud from the music and people conversing, the sounds bounce off the walls as there isn't anything to dampen the hubbub.  We didn't mind, it livened up the place.   The food-  well, here is what I am hoping they would do better on. I asked for hot tea, since it was raining pretty hard out and we sat in the car for 20 minutes as there wasn't any standing room to wait to be seated. No reservations so we pretty much took a chance on a dreary rainy Thursday night.   The don't serve anything hot. No hot tea, no green tea, no Barley or Corn tea... right.  So beer it is.   So we ordered the four choices of beef to start with, 2 flavored, a brisket and the tongue. We also ordered the egg soufflé, a couple bowls of rice and the mushrooms.  The banchan came out quickly, followed by the freshly sliced semi frozen brisket and tongue. I quickly threw those on the grill without hesitance. The rice came out next, it had formed a chewy crust on top making it seem like it had been sitting for a while.  As I prepared myself for the first bite of the first meat of the first Korean bbq in Charlotte, I noticed the cooking tongue had a white circumference. Without thinking too much about it, I grabbed a Cooked piece, chewed it and began to gag so I spit it out. It seems like someone had FORGOTTEN to CLEAN it.  Yup. Someone forgot to peel off the rough sharp outer layer surrounding the bovine's tongue, I gagged because it felt like i had just swallowed a Rose bush.  Why did i order this you ask?  Because if you've ever had it, you know tongue is good when it's good.   I told our server about the issue and even had him touch the spikes on the raw tongue and said he would inform and get the manager....  who never came.  We figured who the manager was after a few minutes but she was clearly too busy (or maybe didn't want to be bothered?) by our issue.  She walked frantically between tables, to the front desk and to the back without smiling much. We didn't want to make a big deal about it so just sucked it up to a lost cause.   Soufflé was left on the stovetop for 2 minutes too long, the eggs were pretty much scrambled in soup when we ate it. It's supposed to be sorta on the silky side. Good flavor tho.   The brisket was simply ok, it was cut a little too thin (it was a little fatty too) so it pretty much turned to a messy cheesesteak type material. If only I had some bread, onions and cheese I coulda made a legit Philly.    The flavors on the other two beef dishes were also just ok, it felt a little \"toned down\" to cater to the general taste... it didn't quite taste as authentic as I've had before.  I didn't get the saltiness and umami of the soy, the heavy aroma of the sesame oil or punch of the pepper flakes or garlic; I felt like I was eating sweet meat and a little hint of something something.   Oh, and about the portions, they give you about 1/2 cup worth of meat so you have to order three times as much to feel like you're actually eating something... listen I'm no heffer. I just dislike having to flag someone down for more food especially since I have to cook it too!  We ordered the pork dishes next, and I understand while it says pork belly... it felt like I was eating lard belly.  It was mostly fat to be honest, I had to cut out a fair amount of the white jiggly stuff just so I didn't have to shave off a few years of my life. The wine pork belly was decent, the curry one didn't have much curry flavor (weird because it was so yellow, you'd think it was loaded) and the hot pepper pork... wasn't even worthy of any scoville units.    The king mushrooms were dry (it's not that hard to slice them real quick per order is it?) and after that we decided to call it quits since we were told (when we first got there) that it's a 2 hour seating. It felt like they were already asking us to leave before we even ordered.  Hello, welcome, you have two hours, ready to order and GO!    So all in all, I hope this is read by anyone who care enough to read it, and by the owners.  This place really has the potential to really make a name for itself.  I understand that Charlotte is a young, growing expanding town, now is the time to set a benchmark to be the only place in town that's worth going to.   I gave two stars and I'm hoping to give 4 or 5 after I finally get over the fear of the tongue incident!  Really though, who doesn't like a good tongue?!"}
{"text":"What a unique and cool dining experience! Table Center grills for searing up your own meats and seafood. Serena was a great waitress keeping things moving with drinks and next rounds of food for the grill. David the GM, stopped in on me to make sure things were going well. And they were! Great environment, great food - excellent service!! Will be back..."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday. It was a pretty long wait but we thought it was definitely worth it. The beef was great and all the sides were delicious. Server checked on us and kept bringing what we needed. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Korean BBQ... I was stalking the opening of Let's Meat. This place is awesome!  Definitely beats the Korean BBQ of many other cities. While some restaurants in LA or NY may seem a little more authentic, the quality of the meat at Let's Meat did seem better than in those cities. Our server, Linda, was fantastic!  I am so glad to see Korean BBQ in Charlotte... this place did not disappoint!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'll start off with a complaint that the noise here was SUPER loud. The noise level was the first thing I noticed when I entered the restaurant and sat down at my table. It was so loud I had to take a star off. Luckily, my group came in around 10 pm on a Monday night so most people were leaving and the noise died down eventually. I can't imagine how loud it must have been on a crowded Saturday night.   The side dishes were quite mediocre; they weren't great but I guess I wouldn't complain too much. The quality of the meat was pretty good though. At $29.99 per person, my friends wanted to take half a star off because of it's price. I currently live in Georgia, so I know that kbbq there can range anywhere from $20-35. Being the first AYCE kbbq in Charlotte, I guess $29.99 is quite reasonable.   The main reason this place deserves 4 stars is because of the great experience I had with customer service. Granted, because my group came in at 10 pm on a Monday night, it wasn't too packed. My table and I were teasing about how it seemed like our server was coming by our table almost every 30 seconds to check up on us. We weren't complaining though because she was very helpful. There must have been at least 3-4 other servers who would bring out our food/side dishes to us. I'm glad to know that even on a Monday night, this place isn't short-staffed.   This restaurant is almost comparable to KBBQ restaurants in Georgia. I'm from NC, so I'm glad this place opened up. Now I don't have to take my old friends all the way to Georgia just to get some kbbq."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel I like to seek out what I can't get at home. When we were in LA I fell in love with Korean BBQ only to be heartbroken that nowhere in CLT did the same all you can eat cook your own Korean BBQ that was so popular out in CA.   I called a couple weekends after they opened to see about getting a reservation. No dice and the man I spoke with said the weekend dinner rush wait was 1-2 hours. Ugh! No thank you! So we waited a couple more weeks and went for lunch. There was no crowd for our Saturday lunch and we had the almost undivided attention of our waiter. We went a second time for an early Sunday dinner (pretty close to 5) and it was busier but we were able to get in. Word of caution - they will not seat you until your whole party is there.   The basics - it is all you can eat and you cook it yourself. Or, in our case on the first visit, the waiter cooked it for the most part while we burned our tongues impatiently taking out items. The second time we went the waiter was much more hands off and we were cooking ourselves. You can order as many meats as you want, as well as refills of the amazing sides they bring. Just don't be greedy because waste will be charged.   Winner winner brisket dinner - in my humble opinion the thinly sliced brisket is the best choice. It comes unseasoned so you can choose any of the sauces they bring to dip it in, or cook it with garlic and jalapeño. It is also a good meat to start with since it cooks quickly.   Bulgoli beef is my second favorite followed up by the squid and newly added ribeye. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn't go crazy for pork belly but I have enjoyed the red wine and red pepper pork belly. I would pass on the egg soufflé and beef chunks.   Possibly because it comes out raw the food comes out super quickly. While waiting between meats, or for meats to cook, there is a huge assortment of sides brought out when you are seated so there is always something to nibble on. So far we've had two great visits and writing this review makes me want to plan a third!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and experience. Highly recommend. Especially loved the beef and pork bulgogi, spicy chicken and the shrimp."}
{"text":"Finally! There is korean bbq in charlotte. AND it's legit. We ate here during the first week in operation and it exceeded all of our expectations. The staff are super friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is upbeat. And most importantly, the food is excellent. I tend to be a bit skeptical of all you can eat kbbq, as the quality of the meat is usually subpar. However, Let's Meat offered great quality food all the way around - from the meat to the side dishes, it was exactly what we have been waiting for in Charlotte. The kimchi is delicious and I would recommend the bulgogi and pork belly. We will definitely be repeat customers. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's all you can eat y'all!!! Growing up with Korean BBQ everywhere I vouch... this is the real thing.   Don't shy away from the non-Marinated meats either. Pour some Galbi sauce on there and drop a few cloves of garlic and BAM... Insert whatever sound/face you make when something tastes good!!!!  Everyone is talking about it. Take her. Try it. I was seated right away."}
{"text":"Went on Easter Sunday. Didn't think it would be so busy but we waited a little over an hour to be seated. The hostess took us to our table but it wasn't cleaned yet so a gentleman who passed by told the waitress to seat us at another table that was already cleaned off. Our waitress Linda was very nice, friendly and helpful. The food came out pretty quick. The food was good. Wish they had intestines and rice cakes. It was on the pricy side though. Will definitely go back since it's the only Korean BBQ here."}
{"text":"When I arrived I didn't realize it was attached to Seoul Food Meat Company.  I learned that it was the same owner just a different concept.  This was one of the best meals I have had in Charlotte in the 20 months I have been coming here for work.  We had most everything on the menu and everything was excellent.  The soy chicken was the best chicken dish and the bulgogi was so good it would turn a vegetarian if they try it.  I LIKE Seoul Food Meat Company, I am in love with Let's Meat Kbbq and will definitely be adding it to the regular rotation and bring a bigger crowd from work next time."}
{"text":"It's seriously been so long since I've had Korean BBQ (bc of Charlotte's lack of one) that I can't compare to anywhere else besides what I make at home.   For $30/person, it's totally worth it to avoid having to purchase and prep the variety of meats and veggies/banchan from \"the Asian store\" to make a proper KBBQ myself. Definitely cheaper to make at home but is it worth the effort and buying in bulk quantities for a date night for two? No. Maybe for 5 or more.   Go if you even remotely like Asian flavor profiles or meat. It's worth it to support restaurants that are stepping out and doing something different than overpriced tacos or American fare. I'm tired of being bored with food options. Or just come to my house the next time we do KBBQ."}
{"text":"This place was Ssssooooo close to getting one star. So close. I've had Korean bbq in several bigs cities - Chi-town, NYC, ATL... I may not be Korean but I'm a pretty good judge of food so i know good Korean BBQ. The risk of one star had absolutely nothing to do with the food or waitstaff - it's all due to the seating arranged by the hostess.   Came here on a Friday night around 5:30 with a party of 14. We were told It would be 40-45 min wait. The hostess pointed out two tables in the front and said that would be ours. We put down our name and headed next door to Seoul for beers while we wait. 30 min later, we check with the hostess and was told it's another 40 min wait again. No reasoning, no explanation. We glanced over at the tables that were supposed to be ours and noticed there's two new sets of customers seated there. Wait - did you just give our tables to someone else? And failed to update us? When we realized that, we went back to the hostess and was told those two tables couldn't accommodate 14 people so they had to change the plan. I was beyond livid. Why were we told one thing and not updated when the plan changed? At this point it's been an hour and a half wait. I don't mind waiting but when you're told 40 min and it's been 90 min, something's gotta give. Because we already invested so much time - not to mention we're here to celebrate my 18 year wedding anniversary - we decided to continue to wait. Luckily our name was called about 5 min after the showdown with the hostess.   We get to our seat and it's three tables. Our friends visiting from MN were on the opposite side so there was absolutely no interaction with them during the meal. Another negative.   Now on to the food. As soon as we sat down, someone came by to take drink orders and the ban chan (side dishes) were dropped off. Before our waters were even given, another person (our waiter) came by to take our food orders and It went uphill from there. I'm talking from a 1 star to a full 5 stars right away.   All of the side dishes were delicious. The meats were so flavorful- definitely the best bulgolgi I've ever had. Packed with flavor. The dipping sauces were plentiful and on point. Try the corn cheese. I know It sounds weird but there's something about gooey mozzarella cheese melted over sweet corn that paired together so well. Who would've thunk It? My 10 year old nephew has to be the pickiest eater alive. He eats a total of 6 things in the world- rice and chicken, rice and eggs, pizza, nachos, cheeseburger and nuggets with fries. That's It. I was not looking forward to paying $12 for nothing but surprisingly, I gave him chunks of pork belly crisped up on the grill over a bowl of rice and he rated It 10 out of 10. That's saying a lot!!!   Let's talk about the service for a minute. Can I give them 5 stars too? I mean, my table consisted of 6 people, 3 of which we're guys over 200 lbs each. And we stayed taken care of. Ask for more rice? You get it right away. You didn't even have to ask for drink refills, you automatically get a glass that's kept full. No matter how many times we asked for additional items, everyone stayed friendly and obliging. Our waitress Camilla must be an angel sent from heaven cause she put up with our neediness with a smile fixed on her face. Gratuity was included in our bill but each of our three tables gave more tips on top of It because our wait staff was impeccable. Then at the end of our meal, the manager or owner walked around and talked to us. Man I wish every place was like this. They have seriously ruined me for customer service anywhere else. All in all, even though we had issues with the hostess and the wait time, we will definitely be regulars here. Just not with a large party again.   Thank you Let's Meat for putting Charlotte on the map when It comes to Korean bbq. You did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"First time there. Don't remember the servers name but he was great. Wait was a little long but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"It was ok it's good for Charlotte though. When we went they were out of slice pork?  one of the meats. Most of the meats didn't have much flavor. The curry one didn't have much flavor either that was disappointing. I think the only one that had flavor was the beef chunk; that was yummy. The service was really good though I didn't have to ask for refills for my side dishes... and there's a sweet sauce that makes up for the missing meat flavor which was bomb! Like a sweet sauce. Buts it's good for Charlotte... would I go again eh only if I was craving Korean bbq. I would rather go to Seoul food if I had to pick between the two. Oh btw they need a bigger parking lot took us about 15 minutes plus to find parking."}
{"text":"Let's Meat was a lot of fun. I would highly recommend this restaurant for large groups but not for an intimate date. It was very loud and honestly quite over priced. Pork, beef tips, chicken and shrimp are not that expensive and there is honestly no way a normal human being can eat $30.00 worth of food. I got a small bottle of raspberry wine which was truly disappointing. Although I should have assumed it was going to be sweet it was honestly not potable and I had to get 80% of the bottle to go. We had fun and the food was truly delicious but I do think this will be a once in a very blue moon experience considering the price."}
{"text":"Loved this place it was our 1st time trying Korean bbq and the experience and the food was fabulous!  The staff was very friendly showed us how to cook the meat by the end of our time we was pretty much pros haha it's all you can eat with a limit of 2hr I think it was , if you never had Kbbq before I suggest you try it"}
{"text":"I will be the first to confess I didn't know the first thing about Korean BBQ but I quickly learned I liked it a lot ! So it was different because I didn't understand the concept at first but when I heard the two phrases unlimited and two hours I said challenge accepted!   I didn't know you could get double and triple meat !!! I quickly learned how to cook the food and the service was super fast and friendly!   I truly enjoyed how the manager came by and cooked the food for us as we learned lemon wasn't used for flavor but rather cleaning the grill. I enjoyed everything from the vegetables to the triple Korean BBQ slices and more.   The options were more limited but you could get brown or white rice. I tried some green stuff that I forgot the name but was really good. Please try this place as I believe it is a lot more fun with a group of ppl between 4 and 12 people.   It is fun when everyone is laughing and enjoy good eats! Great concept and I look forward to bringing all my friends here as well."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday noon. Beef brisket and beef chunk are my favourite! $30 for all you can eat is definitely a good deal. Must try!"}
{"text":"As soon as I heard about this place, I couldn't wait to try it. Luckily, it wasn't announced much before they opened, so I didn't have to wait long. I love Seoul Food and Meat Company, so I figured they would do a good job with this as well.   Boy was I right. This immediately jumped to be one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants. The food is outstanding. It's all you can eat for $30. There's a 2 hour limit, but we were told it wasn't strictly enforced. If you can eat that much meat for 2 hours straight, I'd be impressed. They have a bunch of pork and beef options and a chicken option. Everything we tried was great. The chicken was probably at the bottom of the list. The non-marinated meats and the beef options were our favorites. The sides were awesome as well. We all loved the dipping sauces too.   The service is superb. They have you order 3 meats at a time and they are constantly checking back to see what you want to order next. You cook your own meat on a grill on the table which is awesome. The waiter will help you get started and it's pretty easy. They are helpful with recommendations and bring your uncooked food out almost immediately. You are pretty much never waiting for food.   We had heard how busy and popular it was, so we got there 5 minutes before they opened and there was already at least a 10 person line. We were still seated right when they opened, but it was pretty impressive. It seems like they get people through pretty fast. There were only a few people waiting when we left.   It may seem a little pricey, but what you get is worth it. I could not recommend this place not more highly. It's a must try on the Charlotte restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"What a fun experience, and the food was awesome too! :) came here late on a Friday night and I have only good things to say about the overall experience. The servers were extremely friendly and eager to explain how it all worked, as well as make recommendations since it was our first time eating Korean bbq! We tried the chicken, shrimp, veggies and some pork options as well. All the dipping sauces and the banchan were great! And the sides were delicious - tried the egg Soufflé and soup. Can not wait to return. Though a little pricey, it's well worth it. I love their policy of charging you 10% more if you over order and waste the food (since taking home the leftovers is not an option). I'm excited about this new addition to south end! Go in with an empty stomach, and enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Came here to visit my friend that's staying in Charlotte and we came here after she picked me up from the airport. We were really hungry and was excited that the fact that this place was all you can eat! The place itself is pretty cute and the staff there was really friendly and nice. Our waiter was super nice and gave us recommendations and explained the menu for us. The menu doesn't have a lot of options but the portions were fairly big. When it comes to BBQ, you can't go wrong with beef tongue, pork belly, fatty beef, and bulgogi! The price wasn't bad either and it was a pretty fair price compared to paying for individual dishes. Drinks were fairly cheap and if you you're alcohol tolerance is pretty low like mine, best choice is makgeolli, which is Korean rice wine, and peach flavor makgeolli is the best to go. The noice level was average, mostly listening to EDM music and some hip hop the most. It was hard to listen to my friend's conversation but honestly they got a good music playlist. I would recommend people coming here for lunch and dinner. I would definitely come back here to Charlotte when I take another spontaneous trip!"}
{"text":"It is all-you-can-eat BBQ place for two hours at $29.99. It seems like two hours are short but it is not! They have all variety of seasoned pork belly(samkyusal) and beef selections. Remember that they charge you extra $13.99 per order of galbi.   Also you can grill seafood(shrimp or squid). I enjoyed spicy chicken and beef brisket and corn cheese, yum! It is good to enjoy various side dishes(banchan) including kimchi.(grilling kimchi and pork belly(samkyusal) is always awesome)   If you are a meat lover and want to enjoy different kind of meat at the same time, it is worthy it. Wish they could serve simple dessert at the end of the meal like other typical Korean BBQ places:)"}
{"text":"I had a great experience my husband & I went there, great service which was Steven who was our server gave us the best experience! Amazing staff + managers. Glad to have a Korean bbq close to home! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They have the best service and the food is excellent! It's a much shorter drive than to Atlanta for an authentic feel of korean bbq."}
{"text":"Loved it. Lots of food. Great staff. Helpful staff for first time visitors. Wait time is not too bad. Great for parties of 2-4"}
{"text":"This was my first Korean BBQ experience. I had an amazing time. We chose to go on an off peak time (6 PM on a Monday) to avoid waiting. We were seated immediately and the server came over within 3 minutes. They have several meat options. Be sure to glance over the house rules to ensure no surprises. You can cook the meat or allow the server to cook for you. We opted for them to do so. Awesome experience! It's a 2 hour maximum so order wisely."}
{"text":"After a day golfing with friends, we decided to come try this new place. I've been to many Korean BBQ restaurants in NYC and KBBQs hosted by my friends; therefore, I couldn't wait try this place out! 5 out of 6 of us came here to get a table, but we had to wait for our 6th friend to come in order for them to seat us. Keep in mind that your whole party has to be there before you can be seated. We all decided to get a bowl of white rice to have as a base with all the food we were about to order. It is $30 a person and all you can eat. If you don't finish all the food or if too much is left over, they will charge you an extra 10%... which is reasonable. Parties of 6 or more has a automatic gratuity of 15%. Your party also has a limit of 2 hours at the table. Our waiters name was Bryan, he was amazing! He had some great suggestions and we ordered everything he recommended. Ran back and forth to us because we were, indeed, needy. He still remained attentive and looked like he enjoyed serving us (even if that probably wasn't the case haha). Water was always refilled before it was empty which speaks wonders with how much I drank! Attached is a picture of our receipt. P.S. Get the beef bulgogi. We ate 12 orders of that.... SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is honesty the best Korean bbq in North Carolina! From variety of meats, great service, high quality meats etc. honestly with a group of friends, you would enjoy for sure. The meat wasn't frozen and served to order, it's spacious and gives a welcoming feeling. As far as service, it was really good, my waiter was attentive and nice. I had lower expectations but this place blew my mind! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I waited 4 years for Charlotte to get a KBBQ joint. An authentic one. So when I found out about this place - I knew this was where I was going for my Mother's Day dinner.   I called ahead and asked how long the wait time was - they told me about 20-30 minutes on the phone. However, when we arrived our wait time was less than 15 minutes.   I anticipated it being a flat $29.99 for all of us but they have an adjusted rate for kids $11.99 for under a certain age. I cannot remember the cut off now.   Once you are seated at the table, they will ask you if you are familiar with KBBQ. We are, so they didn't explain everything to us other than how they operate. You get to start with 3 choices of meats and then reorder as you like.   Some KBBQ will cook the meat for you and others you have to cook yourself. This one you have to cook yourself. This really gives the dining experience a fun vibe to it. Once you get familiar with what meats cook the fastest (fatty brisket), you can cook those first  and eat that while the other meats that take longer to cook are cooking.   I really enjoyed their banchan - it was a good assortment but what I didn't like is that if you wanted soup or the egg soufflé you had to ask for it, they don't bring it out as part of the banchan assortment. The kimchi was good, very flavorful. I really enjoyed the tofu. It was properly seasoned - but it is served cold. I have had better potato salad at other KBBQ and we didn't even really touch theirs. It was quite bland.   The meat is good - the variety of choices is pretty standard. We did not try all the marinated meats because the more marinated meats you cook, the stickier your grill gets, the smokier it gets and well that is no fun. And the marinated pork belly that we did try, wasn't super flavorful anyways - so we stuck with the plain.   It is loud here. I mean very loud. SUPER LOUD. The music is so loud, so people are talking loud just so you can hear and it's just LOUD. My son kept complaining and I can understand why.   The staff was amazing. They were friendly, helpful and on point. We will definitely be back. I love KBBQ.  And I should have taken more photos but I was busy cooking and eating. Oops."}
