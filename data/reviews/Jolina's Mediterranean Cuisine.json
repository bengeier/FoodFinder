{"text":"I found Jolina's when on GrubHub! The spinach pie was great and I will definitely get it again! The falafel salad was huge but delicious and I liked how light yet flavorful the potato salad was.  I can't wait to try other items on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I have found in this area period! You seriously can't go wrong. The best chicken shawarma and hummus around. I think I have ordered 20 times, and it is always good and delivered fast. Very nice people run the business. Love it."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often, but when I stumble on a new place and enjoy it, I like to spread the word. Jolinas is a gem! The young woman who served me was quick, and polite. The food came out fast and tasted perfect. Portions were generous and price was fair. I will be back often!"}
{"text":"I come from a Syrian family and grew up on this food.  The Tabouleh was outstanding!! I could've eaten that as a meal alone!  The spinach pie was good.  The meat grape leaves were 90% rice with very little meat, needed a little extra lemon, but pretty good. Unfortunately though, the Kibbee was terrible.  It was way over baked (hard as a rock honestly) with little flavor and very small considering the price.  I picked up take out, so I wasn't able to return for a new piece.   But I will for sure give this place another try."}
{"text":"Jolina's is an amazing place, run by a great family, with delicious food. Every time we go we always ending up order more than we can eat just because everything on the menu is so good. As a vegetarian there are many, many great options."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with a very nice hospitality... The food really worths the price which is not very expensive at all."}
{"text":"Great gyros and hummus! They also deliver to where I live in Brookline which is awesome as well. They have parking in front of the restaurant on Brookline Blvd and there's a dining room if you don't want to do take out."}
{"text":"This food is really great. So far I've only had Jolina's by takeout, so I can't speak to the restaurant itself, but the food is legit good.  The chicken shawarma has a really great flavor and their tahini sauce is so delicious - it has a tang to it that makes it so smooth I wanna put it on everything.  Also, I just tried a baklava and almost cried, it was so good.  Will be visiting in person ASAP!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered Jolinas through uber eats and it was fabulous! We have never been to the actual restaurant, but the take out was great. Real authentic Greek cuisine! Everything was packaged really well and it arrived within 30 minutes. We got an order of baba & grape leaves, as well as a chicken shawarma salad and beef tenderloin salad. All excellent. The portions were large and the price was inexpensive. My only complaint was the beef on the salad was over done and tough to cut. Other than that, great experience. We will definitely be ordering Jolinas again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Jolina's tonight for the first time. We began with the hummus, and it was pretty tasty, though a bit salty. We each had a gyro for the main dish. The meat was moist and delicious! A surprising element was the pickle in the sandwich. I am on the fence on how I feel about it. We finished the meal with coffee and dessert, both satisfying. I would give the food 4 stars, but the staff bumps it up to 5. They were very welcoming without being too aggressive. Just how I like it! We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Food was excellent some of the best I've ever had !!  The staff was very welcoming and extremely friendly. Will definitely make this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"Everything I have had has been delicious. I just want to thank the owners and staff for always coming through. Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I would eat your sleek 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Got delivery today, midafternoon and it was fast and hot. Prices seemed a bit high but portions were huge! Hummus is nice, light and creamy but a bit bland. Sleek! Always happy to find you on a menu.  Portion was overwhelming. Topped with yummy carmelized onions.  First bite an odd flavor I was not sure I liked but I could not stop eating it! The only drawback were the french fries, crispy and hot but had a coating on them from a frozed package and were a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"After finding Jolina's on GrubHub I was very impressed! The grape leaves, hummus, tabbouleh and lentil soup were all phenomenal, fresh and properly prepared. I also enjoyed their traditional Turkish coffee and it did not disappoint. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. Loved it! Fast delivery too! Took only 1/2 the time GrubHub had projected! My order was perfect and the food was very enjoyable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here during a recent trip home to visit family. I really liked the Greek restaurant that previously occupied this space, and I was wary that the new establishment would not be as good. But I think it's actually better. I didn't try the gyro, but everything that we did try was delicious. Of the many dishes we ordered, the sleek and the foole were my favorites, but you really can't go wrong. One member of our group was vegan, and another vegetarian, and everybody left satisfied and impressed. Staff were very kind as well. The ambiance indoors was simple and clean. Will definitely go back next time I'm home."}
{"text":"Jolina's is my new favorite restaurant. This was my second time eating in the restaurant- I've also ordered on their menu through UberEats as well.  This restaurant is nestled on Brookline Blvd - there's plenty of on street parking. Jolina's is like walking into your family's house. You enter in the little lobby, where there is a kitchen in front of you and the dining room is to the left of you. The family who runs Jolina's is so friendly- one of their daughters is your waitress.   This restaurant is BYOB! They have a bottle opener, so just bring your own wine! We hit up the restaurant around 7:30pm - there were other groups eating, but we got seated right away.  Although, all of our food ended up coming out at the same - it was all wonderful.   To start, we ordered two appetizers. My dad ordered the meat grape leaves - I'm not the biggest fan of them, but he said they were delicious. We also ordered the baba ganoush. It's the best I've ever had.  For my entree, I ordered the chicken kebabs (they ask if you want the white meat or dark meat) I opted for the white meat. With the entree, you get a choice of side salad - I tried the Mediterranean salad. The chicken kebabs also come with a generous portion of rice. It is literally the best five I've ever eaten in my entire life.   My parents ordered some baklava to go - they said it was delicious.   Overall, I'm ready to bring my whole family and friends to Jolina's! I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Super delicious and authentic!! They accomodate gluten free very well. The mezza platter is amazing!! The falafel is cooked nice and crisp, and the hummus and baba ghanoush is so flavorful! Everything is fresh, light, and refreshing. I had the chicken schwarma over the Mediterranean salad. The salad was fantastic! The chicken, feta, and tahini dressing were great. I loved it! For dessert, they gave me watermelon for free since I was gluten free. It was sweet and juicy! All of this food came out in 5-10 minutes after ordering. That's how fast they are! If you're in the Dormont area and need a quick, healthy, and good lunch, go to Jolina's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in the South Hills today & had a early dinner @ Jolina's consisting of the mazza platter & sleek. Everything was fabulous with a small bill & ended up taking home leftovers. We live 15 miles east of Pgh & when we go back to that area we will defineately there again."}
{"text":"Ordered from them as soon as I heard they were in my neighborhood. I am a huge fan of Mediterranean foods and love that I can get it at such a great price."}
{"text":"I had my order delivered using GrubHub.  I ordered the meat pie, spinach pie, Chicken Shawarma Sandwich, Nammoura, & Baklava.  The food was delivered much earlier than had been estimated.  The sandwich was so big and filling, I didn't even get a chance to try the meat & spinach pies.  Good meals for tomorrow!  Family members ordered the Beef Kabob with Rice Platter & Lamb Kabob with Rice Platter, both with the Mediterranean salad.  Both meals were good.  The salads looked a bit underwhelming but I was told the dressing was very good.  The Nammoura was good; however, both desserts were overpriced I feel based on the portion sizes ($2.50 for the Baklava (SMALL piece), $3.25 for the Nammoura).  The staff was very friendly and professional.  Overall, very good and I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I really can not find anything to complain about with out delivery and eating experience from Jolina's. We did an online order, said to arrive an hour later, arrived almost 25 minutes early! Who doesn't like promptness?!      Everything was packaged with care. They even included a bag of pita wraps! The utensils and napkins were packaged in a baggie and the sauces were packaged in a separate one. We usually just get things thrown in a bag and I guess the restaurants just hope for the best? Anyway! Thank you for the care!     We ordered a Lentil soup, kids kafta over rice, Falafel appetizer, gyro, and chicken Mediterranean salad. The soup was very tasty and packed full of lentil, grape leaves potato, and onions! It had that grape leaf/green olive taste, which I LOVE!     The kafta over rice looked really good. It was two sausage links over a bed of their rice. Also served with your choice of grilled cheese wrap or fries. We chose the wrap. My older child usually orders the adult portions, but he could barely finish the kids portion and had to end up sharing.      Got to love falafel! These were shaped like donuts, which I thought were cute. They tasted good too. I tend to drown them in the dip though. Falafel, to me, is always a little too dry for me, but these were tastier then I've had before from elsewheres.      Whelp, the Gyro looked great! Emphasis on looked as my husband finished it before I could ask for a bite! The gyro was also the size of a sub! So you probably wouldn't be starving afterwards.    Finally, the chicken Mediterranean salad was yum! It was served with the Jolina dressing. Was served with a descent amount of chicken, cheese on the side as well as tomato, cucumber, and green onion. I will be ordering this again! I recommend this salad, as well as much of their foods, if you are on a cleaner diet.     Over all. For the price, this restaurant is well worth it for delivery! The promptness is superb, the food is great, and the portion sizes are very filling (second meals are always a plus)!"}
{"text":"Driving through and decided to try this place out, totally authentic and tasty. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This place tops it all for me! As many times as I have driven on this road, I have never even noticed it, until I finally slowed my roll. Jolina's is a cute little family owned restaurant. Very family friendly, meet up with the friends, and great for kids as well. And the waiter was very pleasant and with such a welcoming energy. I ordered the kibbi for an appetizer. It was good, but a bit charred on the edges. But I enjoyed the flavor so much, that it didn't matter. For my entrée, I had the gyro with a side of lamb kabob. THIS, is when I fell in love. The gyros are HUGE! And once you taste these gyros, you will never look at another gyro the same. The side of lamb was also very delicious and tender. I seriously thought that when I ordered ALL of this food, I would take leftovers home. NOPE!  I couldn't help myself and dived right in and ate it all. I am so coming back to this place again, especially for the gyro!"}
{"text":"Went to Jolina's for the first time this weekend and will definitely be back- and frequently. Everything we had was delicious... The hummus was creamy and fresh, grape leaves were perfect, and the fatoosh (sp?) crisp and awesome. Also had the lamb kabobs, which were not quite as impressive- tiny pieces of lamb and a small portion for $15.99- but still really good. Best falafel I've had in Pittsburgh too! The staff was very friendly and warm, and they told us that they deliver. I'm in love."}
{"text":"I ordered from grubhub and wow super fast delivery!  I can't remember what the wait time was but it was half of the time it said.  I got a chicken shawarma and falafel sandwich.  Both portions were huge and good.  I prefer chicken shawarma from a different place but I'd order Jolina's again. I've never had falafel before and I tasted a piece of just the falafel not liking it but took a bite of the sandwich and it was delicious. The baklava tasted like I expected also got nammoura and I just wasn't a fan of it."}
{"text":"Another nice little restaurant on the BLVD.  Jolina's is a little place with about 8 tables, some tables only for 2 or 3.  Service was good and friendly.  Had the lunch special of a sandwich, fries and drink for $10.  How can you beat that price?  The chicken shawarma was OK, the chicken was a little dry.  Nice to have another good option on the BLVD.  They did say it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Jolina's is fantastic.  I could eat the sleek everyday.  They also have the best falafel (and I don't usually love falafel).  Options for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores.  Fresh, healthy options that satisfy people who don't like healthy food.  Have been there with a big group (byob ) and tried lots of things and everything was good.  I order delivery frequently (seriously, try the sleek, never thought I would genuinely crave kale and beans) and will definitely be back with friends.  Thanks for all the delicious food!"}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh for work and I decided to order takeout to my hotel on ubereats. This place popped up and I figured I'd see what PA had to offer for Mediterranean. This place was terrific! The rice pilaf was perfectly seasoned, as was the chicken, and the chicken was melt in your mouth! The dressing with the salad made the whole thing! I also ordered a Kanafee and I probably could've just eaten 10 of those and been satisfied. There are a lot of expensive restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh that don't hold a candle to the taste of this place for half the price."}
{"text":"Always great food.  Really good energy here to just be yourself and enjoy the food the people are genuine and wonderful."}
{"text":"Oh my God! Was that good!! I used the new Yelp app EAT24 to order food from Jolinas. I'm always up for trying new places. With that said, I've have yet to be impressed with the options available in my area. Jolinas more than met my expectations. This is NOT your run of the mill Greek restaurant. My brain was dancing while eating, I ordered the falafel sandwich, the hummus plate, and the lentil soup, the sandwich was amazing! Still hot but not soggy and the toppings were perfect, not too much, not too little. The hummus and eggplant were soon good! I don't do many reviews if any ,but I was compelled to do so. Absolutely delicious.  Ps. It only took about 30 min for delivery"}
{"text":"My favorites so far since I've tried their food recently are Vegetarian Grape Leaves and Sleek.  Next I will try the Spanakopita and potato salad."}
