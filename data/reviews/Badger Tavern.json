{"text":"Nice to have Tony.., whoops, Badger Tavern back!  The place is clean, they did a nice upgrade of the bar area and reconfigured furniture placement and replaced a lot of it all together.  Also nice to see a reasonably priced burger back on the menu along with some healthy alternatives.  Plenty of help means good service in a nice clean place! Looks like a nice steady business has returned so it looks like \"The Clubhouse\" is back stronger than ever!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, the Badger Tavern (formerly Tony Frank's) served up the best cheeseburger and fries I've had in a long time. Clean, unpretentious, large portions, fresh food -- and a prompt, courteous waitstaff.   They make it look easy.   Managers of the Great Dane and Cafe Hollander should stop by and take notes."}
{"text":"New paint job, new fries, new higher prices, moved a few tables around, but still a good burger, just like when it was Tony Franks."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here yesterday for a quick burger and day drink! We hadn't been in since it was Tony Frank's....I don't remember the previous d√©cor or anything but it felt brighter in there to me. We both had Gin and Tonics, and oh my - they were plenty stiff for a lunchtime drink. I'm not complaining though. I had their special of the day, the Johnny Mac (their take on a big Mac) and my husband had the Patty Melt - both burgers were soooo good. Mine was cooked a little more than I wanted, but it was super juicy and their fries are my favorite style - super crunchy on the outside. It's a no-frills great burger joint, and we will definitely try them out again!"}
{"text":"Great fish fry and excellent service! Salads and wraps are good healthy options too!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the badger Tavern Friday night it was recommended by some friends. A very relaxed atmosphere and did a fish fry that even surprised me. We were waited on almost immediately when we sat down and had food on the table within 5 to 10 minutes. The fish fry was absolutely delicious, reasonably-priced and made just before served. The wait staff was very friendly and very attentive. There were plenty of options, two or three pieces of fish french fries or onion rings homemade coleslaw which I might add was absolutely delicious. When you left you weren't hungry anymore. It was also nice to have a mixed drink or cold beer with your meal. We will definitely do this again, and we came all the way from Portage."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!  Great service!  Friendly neighborhood bar.  Attentive staff and could not ask for a better bar burger.  Try the TD Burger!"}
{"text":"Just had the best cheeseburger for under $6 I can remember in years. Simple bar menu, but they do it well. At least 8 beers on tap, many others in bottles. Cleaned up over old Tony Frank's, where I didn't always feel safe. Nice outdoor patio, but you hear and see belt line traffic. We kinda dug it. Will come back."}
{"text":"I am happy to see that Badger Tavern has opened it's doors.  Besides the signage, I don't think much has changed since the Tony Frank's days.  The BT has a similar menu of it's predecessor and I opted for the patty melt.  Perfectly cooked with fried onions on marble rye, it was exactly what a patty melt should be.  A little grease, a little ooze from the cheese, and full of flavor.  With being open just over a week, service still needs a little tweaking with multiple waitstaff coming to a table to ask for an order. Not a huge deal-eagerness is far better than apathy. Happy to have a local tavern back in business."}
{"text":"Pretty straightforward juicy burger menu that lived up to the hype. Service was extremely prompt and the serving sizes were generous. Not many places to get a cheeseburger like this under six bucks."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar to stop and have a beer and a Reuben!  There isn't much in this neighborhood for food options, so it's nice to have a place to go.  Nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Tony Franks under a different name.  I don't think the menu changed really at all...   The prices look pretty reasonable, but when you remember they don't include fries, it's not such a value.   I was really hoping they'd change at least that.  I guess that's status-quo for a tavern, but... I loved the TF's Reuben, and this one was almost as good...but...I know this seems like splitting hairs but it's ESSENTIAL to not just grab a slab o' slices of corned beef out of the  package they get from Sysco or wherever and slap them on the grill together, but to pull them apart and grill them separately for a moment, there's something about the folds or nooks and crannys. etc.. Anyway.  They're OK...but not great.   We did have a very good server."}
{"text":"I love this bar. It's a great local neighborhood bar with friendly staff and a great atmosphere. Not a dive bar at all. Good clientele, clean, and friendly vibe.  They have an outside area in front and it get a lunch and Friday fish fry rush. So plan ahead. Very good food."}
{"text":"What a surprise this was.  I was traveling through town and looking for place for lunch. I like local joints to I took a chance.  The burgers were great and the onion rings too.  If I come back through Madison I will be sure to stop in again.    Nice staff and plenty of big screens to watch the game."}
{"text":"First impression was excellent service and hamburger. Nicer tables then I remember. Bar is the same I believe. Nice face lift. I'll  be back again."}
{"text":"For the most part, very little has changed at this location since it previous incarnation as Tony Franks Tavern.  It still sports the familiar blue awning over the front entrance, has the same impressive L-shaped bar and the iconic burger-centric menu.  There are differences if you look closely: the table tops are new, the new owners gave the joint a thorough cleaning and the service is significantly more attentive than it was during the Tony Franks death spiral.  This confluence of factors seems to be a winning combination - the place was near capacity when I visited for lunch on a Tuesday in mid-November.    I was promptly greeted as I entered and was instructed to find an open table.  A cheerful server arrived a minute later to take my drink order.  I let her know I needed to leave in 45 minutes, so I immediately ordered a corned beef Reuben sandwich with a half order of fries and silently wondered if the tiny kitchen could keep up with the sizable lunch crowd.  As I waited for the food, I watched the staff in action and they energetically engaged with the lunch time patrons, especially the bartender.  Despite the business, the noise level was not all that bad.  My order came in about five minutes and at first glance, passed the eye test.  My fries had a gorgeous golden brown hue and the marble rye was well toasted from its ample time on the griddle.  While the slices of bread used for my sandwich were not huge, the contents were generously portioned and poured out of the sandwich into the basket holding my meal.  While the fries went from freezer to the freezer to the fryer, they were well prepared, perfectly seasoned and delightfully crunchy.  Fortunately, the fries has enough flavor on their own because the \"House Recipe\" brand ketchup was way too sweet for my tastes- blech. Since none of the sandwiches on the menu come with a side, ordering a half order of fries for $1.99 is a solid option.    My Reuben ($7.95) was standard bar and grill fare with institutional grade ingredients.  While the griddle work with the bread was solid, the generic corned beef needed more sear to add additional flavor, since the meat was on the bland side.  The flavor that predominated my meal was the overpowering kraut that was copiously applied.  The kitchen followed the standard script for assembling a Reuben without applying any unique touch - there was nothing memorable about this sandwich. While I didn't order one, I do have to add that the burgers served at the neighboring tables looked outstanding.  While I'm glad this location has successfully re-opened, the standard pub fare means I probably won't become a regular.  However, if that is what you seek, the Badger Tavern is worth checking out."}
{"text":"The lost art of cooking a great burger is found here at the Badger Tavern. Great quality meat, cooked perfectly, seared on the outside, juicy on the inside, great ingredients and a really good bun, wow! Best burger in town! Wash it down with a craft beer....this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Full of lazy drunk regulars..bartenders are a bunch of never beens who have bad attitudes because they realize their lives are meaningless...We just got up and left"}
{"text":"Favorite bar in Madison! Deb is the best bartender ever! Great food and drinks and awesome service!"}
{"text":"We stopped here the other night as I was curious what it was like since Tony Franks closed. The inside has been cleaned up and seems brighter to me. It was a bit of a wait to be waited on and they were not busy, but our waitress was pleasant. We both ordered cheeseburgers and we split an order of fries. I asked for my burger medium well, and it was cooked perfectly. The order of fries was plenty for us to split and came out piping hot. The wait for our food was minimal. I thought the prices were reasonable, maybe even a little less than Tony Franks at the end. My only disappointment was we wanted to eat outside, but everyone that was already eating outside was smoking at their tables. Did not want to sit in the middle of that! Maybe they could designate a separate smoking area away from the eating area?"}
