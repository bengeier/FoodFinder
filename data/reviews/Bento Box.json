{"text":"I've come here quite a few times over the years when I stay at the Hampton on business. I don't think I'll be back since the State cut my perdiem I just can't afford it anymore. I pay half as much for more sushi at my favorite place. Kampai, in Tucson. Sadly, it is usually dead here when the place next door is busy. Food is decent, but way too much for the price. For instance, I can't understand why a salmon roll is around $5 but put a sliver of avacado in there and now it's $10.  Should be a bick more, maybe."}
{"text":"While this place has great food we were left sorely disappointed this evening. When we arrived we waited in the waiting area with two other parties of people. There were clearly three tables available. The server did not tell any of us to take a seat nor did he seat us. After waiting  15 minutes we had to leave because the server was so slow and flustered. Definitely a big disappointment."}
{"text":"First time here, dropped in for lunch. Sushi was awesome and the prices are great! My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This place freakin rocks!!! I eat here at least twice a week and I see the same faces so I know they love it too.  The bento boxes are a lot of bang for your buck. The tempura rolls a are my favorite. I love happy valley, or Diamondback's."}
{"text":"We got here at 7pm on a Sunday and there was only one server.  The server was ok, maybe a little too informal, but whatever.  We were here for the food.  We ordered oyako donburi, katsu donburi, and a teriyaki chicken bowl for our kid (there's no childrens menu).  The oyako and katsu donburi bowls were heavily salted, and lacking the right flavor.  It was probably mostly flavored with soy sauce.  The chicken teriyaki was inedible.  It was the texture of a leather belt and tasted like charcoal briquettes. How do you get chicken teriyaki wrong?  My son refused to eat the chicken.  Thankfully the rice was actually cooked well.  This place was rated really well, so we are super disappointed. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in a strip mall with an authentic sushi chef.  Get the sashimi plate - generous portions of the good stuff (hamachi, tako, ebi), more than 12 slices as described on the menu, with a mound of seaweed salad."}
{"text":"A good place for lunch, don't get me wrong.  The ladies up front were very pleasant and friendly offering good suggestions for what to try.  Hubs had sush - spicy tuna, salmon and crab (so I could try it being preggers).  Nothing earth-shattering but tasty none-the-less.  My bento box was well portioned and more than enough.  Everything was good, filling and flavorful - I had spicy pork, which was a little oily but still tasted great.  The panko sides were good, the potato salad seemed odd but perhaps that's bento standard and I loved the sesame dressing on the green salad.  My favorite was and always will be the sushi made just right with extra wasabi and ginger per my liking/mixing.  Yum.  Soon enough, sushi, soon enough. :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  After living in Asia for several years, I came to love sushi.  I really didn't think I'd find anything here in Phoenix that could meet my high expectations.  But I did!  This place is great.  The owners are wonderful, one of which is the sushi chef.  I knew I was at the right place when we started talking about the documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\".  The chef has actually eaten there and strives to provide his guests at Bento Box a wonderful experience too.  It is buried in a mall near Lowes...well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Just to preface I came here once and got the teriyaki chicken bento box.   Some pros and cons with this place:   Pros: high quality chicken meat, non of that dark or chewy stuff hat is supposedly meat. Decent tempura. Quick service. Friendly waiter. Clean restaurant.   Cons: I've grown up on Japanese food and frequent Japanese restaurants. Unfortunately this place is just kind of bland. The sushi rice had no distinct rise vinegar flavor which is an essential ingredient to rice that you use on sushi rolls. The salad dressing had an odd orange flavor that is uncharacteristic of the typical ginger dressing on Japanese salads in bento boxes. Tempura sauce tasted old or something was off.  All in all just more cons then pros so had to give it 2 stars. That being said didn't try anything else on the menu. If I get bland sushi rolls I typically don't want to go back to that restaurant. That being said it's a very easy fix on their part. I also expect better quality food for $13."}
{"text":"Excellent food and awesome service, good luck Lee and Hamada in this new adventure. Thank you for been so nice with my boys."}
{"text":"Came here a few times before and wasn't that great BUT!!! Under new management and the food is on point! Slow minor changes are making this a diamond in the rough! New management: whatever you are doing, keep doing it! Especially personally serving our sake bombs and opening our beers with chop sticks! My go to for sushi and sake!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here for dinner MANY MANY times!  The sushi rolls and the ramen bowls (what we usually order) are amazing!  Service is quick and the staff is always friendly.   The Japanese ninja is my favorite roll by far. We always try another one and have never been disappointed!    The prices are very fair and a night out here is much easier on our budget than ah so... And the food is WAY BETTER!!    Highly recommend this place. Be sure to not come too late because they close at 830 during the week and 930 on the weekends. :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the neighborhood! Reasonably priced ESPECIALLY for the great quality. Definitely worth the stop in, don't let the small space scare you away."}
{"text":"Frazzled...Is the only way to describe what my lunch experience was at Bento Box. The place was less than half full and the service was terrible. All I heard from every table, including ours was...\"I'm so sorry\". Orders were wrong, late or in our case not even put in...after a 20 minute wait and us asking twice. Look if you can't service your patrons...don't open for business."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. First of all, it was very slow. It is a small restaurant so for the staff to be overwhelmed with very few people in the restaurant is concerning. The tables weren't being pre-bussed, no one's drinks were being refilled. Everyone seemed to be sitting around the restaurant staring waiting for food.   The server moved at a glacial pace even though she claimed to be busy. A customer wanted to sit at the sushi bar but it was dirty so she asked the server and the server said \"ya it's just busy so it's not bussed\". Like what??  The server had no idea what was in any of the rolls that I asked her and had to keep leaving to ask.   They were out of salmon and pork.   My meal came out 15-20 minutes before my mom's meal came out so I was done eating when she got her food.   At the end, the owner came out and comped our entire meal (after dumping hot soup on my mom) and suggested we come back and give it another try.   The three stars are ONLY for the owner's nice gesture. Everything else was horrific."}
{"text":"Gave it a 1star because there is no option for no stars. We attempted to eat here this past Saturday. Walked in with my family just after 3PM.  We were greeted by a man sitting at a table.  He tells us that they are closed for lunch. What restaurant in a shopping center shuts down for lunch?  Absolutely absurd!  By the way, the OPEN neon sign in the window was on."}
{"text":"Management needs improvement. Expected more. Received much less. Food is okay but bad service can ruin even the best culinary experience."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. They have AMAZING quality sushi, but every time we come, I feel like they totally ignore us! We ordered our food and drinks and no one brought us our drinks for about 30 minutes yet they had been serving everyone else in the restaurant. I understand it was busy, but how can you forget a customer? This has happened twice now and the first time there was no body. I give 3 stars for the bad service, but I would've rated 5 because their food is great!"}
{"text":"Is one of the best sushi places in the area. The owners are very nice especially the wife, she always remembers me and makes everyone feel welcome."}
{"text":"My favorite beef bulgogi! The service can sometimes be a little iffy depending on the night. But I've always had great food here, sushi never disappoints and the pork Katsu is also really good."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for lunch and didn't know what to get.  We've been back twice because it was so good. I ordered the  spicy Pork bulgogi bento.  Everything that came with it was wonderful, the salad has been super fresh and crispy, I love the dressing that comes with it, very light soy type of dressing.  The tempura veggies are super fresh and crispy.  I loved the spicy pork.  Not too spicy, just enough kick.  Like Taylor Momo's review, there were a few things unexpected that came with it, and everything tasted amazing.  I don't leave there over-stuffed and in a food coma which is detriment to sitting at a computer all day, but I left feeling full and satisfied. I'm happy to have a new fave place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Quality-wise, there is nothing wrong with Bento Box. The fish is fresh and prepared well. If you want a salmon nigiri roll, Arizona Roll, or gyoza, it'll come out and taste good. It's acceptable. The other thing worth mentioning right away is you can't go wrong with a $5 Sake Bomber.   So food and drink are good, but there is nothing special about this place. Nothing is outstanding or memorable. Considering their location this place is extremely expensive for what you get. Sure, it's sushi, but the same quality can be found at a revolving sushi bar. I do not get the same quality experience or feel the chefs are at the same level as other places I have been to in Phoenix.  Service wise, it's slow. When you are here, try to order as much up front as you can because if you add a roll later it'll take the same amount of time to get it out to you because there is only one sushi chef.  The ramen is good considering Phoenix does not have many places to get ramen, but again it's not especially good.   For me it is worth a longer drive to get much better sushi at a much better cost."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I love Bento Box!! Super affordable, yet high quality sushi! Our favorite is the ASU roll! Try it out! Will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, clean on the patron side, not sure on kitchen cleanliness.  $5 Sake bombs!! ~ just wait till you see how the bottles are opened  Average pricing on food  Could use more decor for ambiance  Restrooms are bland, but hey, it's a restroom ~ they could use more lighting, maybe a couple \"daylight\" CFL's would do the trick  I would like to see more offerings on sushi menu ie. special rolls (lollipop, smoked salmon, ect.), Botan Shrimp, Blue Fin, FRESH REAL WASABI or even real wasabi paste. I saw some in a picture here on Yelp but wasn't offered when I was there.  I didn't notice a \"specials\" board like most other sushi places. Might be a good idea to have one. Would let patrons know if there is something special not on the regular menu like Blue Fin ect ect.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We come here frequently. Their lunch prices are great for bento box meals. We have tried the bulgogi beef and salmon meals which were great. Quality is pretty good and sushi is fresh. Highly recommend trying their fresh wasabi. Customer service is great too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I've really enjoyed it both times. Great sushi, great atmosphere, a great place to come chill at after work. I'll keep coming!"}
{"text":"Our first time visit & probably last. We came in here on saturday around 3pm for lunch special as they have advertised all over the window. Sushi was NOT of good quality, (I have been eating sushi for 17 years now, and I am not talking about California Rolls) the fish was warm, yellow tail was old, the salmon was warm & not fresh. The waitress gave us 3 miso soups when there was 4 for of us at the table ordering the same thing & 1 miso soup was half way full, she said she had no more, but then 20 minutes later she served a table next to us with Miso soup, but thats OK... bc we were waiting for our sushi & rather eat that than fill up on soup!!!  She didnt even ask us what we wanted to drink, she just brough waters & cups were not all the way full either... It looked like she was the only one working as a waitress & the sushi chef... so she kept putting her plastic gloves On & Off, her was down mot even in the net, so I am NOT sure how hygenically speaking if its proper for someone who is making sushi!!!   Around 4:30 another waitress came in & started serving our table, I won't come back here again, the quality of sushi is not good so save your $, I am NOT sure why people in the past reviews are saying its cheap & you pay for what you get, because their prices were the same as other places I have been in BUT the food was 100x better!!   I am giving them 2 stars for service!!!"}
{"text":"I needed a sushi fix and this was the closest thing Google sent me to. It was alright. Service was fine. I ordered a sashimi salad and a couple of their signature spicy rolls... Rolls look great BUT,  mouth watering anticipation is met with disappointed taste buds, sadly. Kinda bland, spicy rolls not really spicy & the sauces are too much of a simple cheap mayo taste and trust me, I love my mayo but this was a no-go. Skip it and go to Ah-So right across the street but if you must, like I said, it's alright. Whomp, whomp, whomp."}
{"text":"The food is usually good, but we didn't eat tonight. They seemed to have ran out of everything and then, completely forgot our order. The waiter apologized after we waited 45min for food that was never made. Don't go on busy nights. They can not handle a crowd."}
{"text":"The food was ok and I enjoyed the sushi (the only reason it's not 1 star)  but the picture of the bento box dinner showed a full tuna roll in the picture but only comes with a couple pieces of California roll... I normally wouldn't complain but the only waitress in the place was too busy taking to a guy to take our drink orders for 15 minute even though the only people in the restaurant was literally a single guy sitting at the sushi bar (talking to the waitress) and me and my girlfriend at a table. Once the food got there it wasn't bad. I got a spicy tuna tamaki (which means hand roll in Japanese) and the check said it cost almost 10 dollars when the menu said 4.95. So I asked the waitress about it and she tried to explain to me that the hand roll costs nearly $10 and the tamaki cost less and continued to argue with me until I asked for my menu and showed her what I marked down and explained to her tamaki and hand roll mean the same thing in different languages. Food is decent but the 1 server in charge of 2 tables managed to turn our experience. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh sushi, tasty noodles, excellent rolls too. Hours are early, so get in before close, but most definitely worth the money. The staff is friendly, professional and courteous. The Mexican and fire roll are delicious...maybe one day they will add garlic edamame?"}
{"text":"The sashimi bento box was really good. The pieces of sashimi were so tender and delicious. Best I e have in Phoenix. The only disappointment was the California roll in it. That's not real sushi and just rice would have been better. The spicy tuna roll was great!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving negative reviews for  place when the folks are so nice.  Our server and the sushi chef were extremely friendly but I'm sad to say, the food was nothing special.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  As a sushi connoisseur, freshness is the most important ingredient.  The fish didn't taste terribly fresh.  The rolls were mediocre at best and bland at worst.  Husband reported feeling a bit ill afterward."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly staff. Love there $5 beer with free Sake. Can't wait to go back. Been here several times and plan to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I was hungry during lunch time and I work in the same plaza so I thought I'd try this place out. I got the 3 roll lunch special for $12.95 and the total came to $14.03 with tax which is reasonable for 3 rolls of sushi. I got the cucumber and avocado roll, tootsie, and shrimp tempura roll and asked to leave the sauce on the side because I personally don't like to have the sauce on my sushi since it gets soggy. I called for pick up and he told me it would take about 20 min. I came, paid, got my food right away then went back to work to try out the food. Overall, you get what you pay for, these rolls are cheap for a reason and nothing really stood out to me. I didn't expect it to taste extravagant or anything considering it's more of an average sushi place but I've had tasty sushi for cheap before and this was just ok. I think their specially sushi rolls look more promising so I'll give that a try next time.  For the food I got today, I'd rate it 2 stars. For the customer service which was quick and convenient, I'd give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best God damn sushi you'll have in this state. Little place but it's anything short of heaven. Good prices, good service, good music. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Small little place, the food is Top Shelf!  Love the place so much, I have taken friends here and never was disappointed.    You have to do the $5 sake bombs though."}
{"text":"First impressions. I'm a stickler with sushi so others might not be so picky.  The nori on my spicy tuna roll was tough- too chewy. Rice was not cooked long enough. Slightly too firm. The tuna didn't strike me as fresh. It lacked flavor and was mildly pink.   Shrimp tempura roll was drenched in sweet syrup. I can understand a little for flavor and design but this roll was just drenched in it.  Yech.   As far as sushi goes, nothing great. I wasn't hungry anymore when I was done with two rolls but that was my only take away from the meal- just that it took away my hunger- not that it was particularly good.   MORE annoying was that for a 9 dollar and 70 cent tab my waitress took the 15.00 Cash I gave her and assumed that the extra six bucks was a tip. !!!!!! I was on break at work and the process of getting my change back took WAY too long!!!!   (I sat there waiting for her to realize that I didn't intend to tip her six dollars on a 9 dollar tab.)   Finally the sushi chef got her attention when she emerged from wherever she had gone.   I asked for my change and when she brought it back she brought back 30 cents!!! (The ACTUAL change from the 9 dollar and change tab not the rest of the change from the 15 dollars cash.)   Can I have five dollars in ones back so I can tip you twenty percent of the 9 dollars and 70 cent tab NOT tip you 5 dollars on what wasn't even a 10 dollar tab!   Good lord!  All that made me late back to work.   I still left her 2 bucks but I won't be back.  Not worth it.  The bad 80's music playing the whole time made it much worse. I mean, ACDC is fine and all, but not blasting at lunch when I'm eating mediocre sushi and waiting for my server to do math. !  I'm sure she was new and will never make that mistake again. Unfortunately neither the service, the food, or the decor was enough to entice me back."}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi to us, and although it's a tiny spot, we have never been disappointed! Excellent sushi, (my fave is cinco de mayo roll), great Udon, ramen, miso, seaweed salad....and they have iced green tea which I love. Glad to be able to drive to good sushi in five minutes."}
{"text":"The food was so amazing!! I recommend sitting at the bar and letting the chef choose your selections. Best uni, Quail eggs, eel, and salmon in town... go with sashimi!! The rolls are exellent too! I can't get enough! What a gem to find!!! Always so good!!"}
{"text":"Decent place to get sushi in the north valley. It seems like food diversity is a little scarce this far north so it's nice to have a place like this. Sushi rolls are fresh and tasty. If you're not feeling like sushi the bulgolgi bowl is great! I like the regular beef more than the spicy pork though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was not impressed nor was I disappointed. Food was good but not OMG I gotta have it again. Definitely better Japanese in town, which is too bad since it's close to home.   Service was slow and inaccurate. Ordered 3 different rolls and received only two, with one of the rolls duplicated. Drinks were never refilled. Almost got a refill after waiting over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged, but all I got was a sorry I don't have your check because the POS was down.   I had high hopes, it has generally good reviews and it's close to home, but this will probably be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Had the Tonkotsu Ramen and with a Kirin Ichiban beer. The ramen was outstanding. The waiter was super friendly and helpful. I plan on eating here again while I'm in town."}
{"text":"Bento Box for lunch on Tuesday. Seven other customers here. I ordered the Spicy Pork Bulgolgi Bento Box.   My lunch arrived in six minutes, grilled, fried and crisp-tender. The SPB Bento Box had the pork Bulgolgi of course, plus four pieces of California roll, six pieces of tempura, seasoned rice and a salad.   I always like the salad with the sesame dressing. The rice is a good foil to the Bulgolgi and the tempura was excellent: light, crispy and fresh. The roll was good and fresh but the Bulgolgi stole the show. Marinated, grilled tender pork with a saucy treatment, with onions grilled in. They make it right, here.   Excellent meal, very good service and I highly recommend Bento Box for a fast, tasty meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm visiting my parents in Phoenix, I like to stop by this place. I went there frequently from the moment they opened to the moment I moved to Tempe. I LOVE their tonkotsu ramen, and their gyoza is the best I've ever had! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. So pleased to have them in Happy Valley Towne Center!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but they did nothing great, not even close.  It felt like nobody was trying, sort of just mailing it in.  Food was ok, service was actually pretty good, atmosphere not so good.  We won't be returning.   Oh, the calimari was actually terrible.  I am not sure how it could be THAT fishy and tough."}
{"text":"The lunch specials for sushi are awesome. I come here all the time on my way home from work. Really can't beat the price and the food. Highly recommended.  And if you have not been here before. I would say come at lunch and get the crunch roll or the asu roll."}
{"text":"Every time we go hear, we sit at the sushi bar.  One time, we ordered yellow tail sashimi and the owner let us taste the belly...mmm....butter.  Last time we went, we just asked the sushi to make us a couple rolls and sashimi of his choice and it was all excellent.  My only complaint is that they are not open later in the evening.  Price is good."}
{"text":"My first time eating this type of food. Not a bad experience. Ordered the chicken teriyaki box and had the shrimp tempura on the side. Service was pretty descent. The guy behind the counter making the food seemed pretty hostile but since I don't speak Japanese I can't say for sure. Portions were decent and flavor was pretty good. I would give it a try again."}
{"text":"Just moved to N PHX and found my sushi home!!! This place is amazing!  Fresh fresh fresh and we are talking about a true chef!  Chef Hamada Shinji is more than amazing!  He knows what you'll like!  Great pride in what I call \"pieces of Art!\"  This is a small place but the flavor and the true sushi is BIG!  A must try then you're a regular!  I would drive and hour to get here for sushi that's like Cali!"}
{"text":"Tiny not too fancy restaurant that serves up some seriously good food.   We shared a lunch bento box and some sushi.  The Beef Bulgogi was insanely delicious. It lacked heat but had great flavors that were very balanced and the beef was tender like butter.   The sushi I tried was all very clean tasting. The was nicely seasoned and held together well. Sushi was seasoned under the fish like it should be.  The spicy tuna roll really was very good. Best one I've had since my favorite sushi place changed ownership. It was truly spicy and had other flavors going on to make it delicious.  It's not on the menu but for $2.00 more you can order wasabi sauce that is much better than the wasabi paste they serve.  One of the best for sushi in this area.  Slight update.....After I wrote my review I found out that I am visiting after a newer ownership. The current owner uses higher quality ingredients than the last owner did. I was told this by the waiter who also worked for the last owner."}
{"text":"Tried this place one more time and I am done. Ordered Ramen for kids and it came without the egg or fish cake. I asked about it and they said they were out. We'll, OK but should have told me ahead of time. Still charged me full amount."}
{"text":"I thought the soft shell crab roll was very good, but aside from that i thought the food was just so-so.  the rolls are small and if you get the box, the california roll slices are tiny.  The service was friendly and we go right in, just very so-so food or maybe we just ordered the wrong items."}
{"text":"Another great meal last night. The new owners are terrific people. Saw quite a few people come in for to-go orders. It's now officially on our rotation."}
{"text":"Yesterdays experience was awful. I ordered a dinner box and the salad was gross. It was the last of the salad. Like the hard pieces and the ends were brown. They put thousand Island on my salad and didnt ask me what kind of dressing when I ordered it.  When i told them, they didnt offer to fix it. Im never ordering to go again."}
{"text":"Cute and quaint little spot.  Perfect spot to go and have some sushi while doing some shopping around the area.  Cool staff, great food and it was fast and affordable."}
{"text":"I've always seen this place but only recently tried it. It's a bit of a sleeper, but it's wonderful! Came in on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded. Service was quick and attentive. Prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food you receive, not to mention the $5 sake bombers. The nigiri and hand rolls were very fresh and flavorful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food. Occasionally they are pretty busy so you might have a little wait. Food usually 8.5 out of 10. Last time they had just a little too much sauce on the dragon rolls. Owners are GREAT people, and always friendly."}
{"text":"I don't like to leave negative reviews but this was such an unpleasant experience, I felt I should share.  I've been eating lunch here for approx 2 years, I like the chicken teriyaki lunch box, and Philly roll.   Arrived at 12:45, there were 3 open tables awaiting to be cleared. No worries. No other open tables.  The tables were cleared, I was suggested to sit down at table near the door, menu hastily placed in front of me. No problem, they're busy. A gentleman arrived after me, and he was warmly greeted, \"the regular? Green tea?\" And he was seated promptly.  Minutes go by, no one to take my order, or offer me a water, or bring a water.   After about 10 min, gentleman who arrived after me receives his green tea, and a tonkotsu bowl I believe. Still no one returns to take my beverage or food order.  At that point, with menu still in front of me, I departed, to go next door where I have always been greeted, and never forgotten.  I didn't rush out, did not hear anything as I exited either.  I do not think I will return, there are so many choices in the area that extend better service to all customers. It has been often short staffed here and I understand one person can only attend to so many tables, but the prices are the same for everyone."}
{"text":"So I'm a regular here now, and I have to say... My last four star rating was soooo wrong! This little family-operated place is definitely underrated. Shinji is the male owner who is always seen on most nights working the sushi bar. He says hi and bye and thank you to Every Single Person or Group that walks in and out the door. How awesome is that? He genuinely cares about his customers and the owners and staff, and the food, are the biggest reasons I always come here.   His wife Lynn helps out around the restaurant, assisting servers with table and she's always so friendly and easy to remember you, if you actually talk to her. She's always happy to hear me speaking Korean and always compliments me on it, so that makes me feel special. Daja is one of the main servers here and she's always super friendly and on top of things! She's learning Korean just like me so it's fun conversing with her!   On to the food... They have an assortment, mainly Japanese and Korean. The reason? The owners are Japanese and Korean! They have sushi, sake, Udon, Ramen, Bento boxes... and then they have Bulgogi bowls (which are sooo delish) and other Korean options. It's mostly Japanese tho. The pricing is not bad and they have $5 Sake Bombs everyyy day. They're closed every Sunday which kind of stinks but I'm glad for them they take a day off!"}
{"text":"We have always had a great time here. Food is delicious. $5 sake bombs in Friday nights at least, not sure if they do that any other time. One of the servers, younger guy, is hilarious. We definitely need to go here more often!"}
{"text":"This place got 6 code violations from the health department.  Check out cbs news Kpu May 2nd. I ate here last week and found my fish not to be cold enough.  Although the woman was nice enough to exchange my order, I was floored to read about these violations!"}
{"text":"1st time here and very impressed with the friendly service and greeting when I walked in the restaurant. i wanted sashimi, the waitress recommended 6 pics sashimi and spicy tuna roll bento box lunch. OMG! my lunch was delish!!!! thank you!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has such high reviews because it was absolutely awful. Maybe Arizonans have forgotten what fish tastes like? First off, the service is atrocious; there's only 9 tables but there were 2 servers when I got here and it still took 20-30 minutes to get edamame and water. Then, they managed to confuse our order with someone else's despite how few other tables there were. The server dealing with our table actively avoided us and ran the second he set food down, one time when my brother was mid-sentence expressing the order was wrong. Despite my cup being intentionally perched on the edge of my table, didn't get a single refill.   Nearly all the rolls are spicy. I ordered one of the few that was not listed as spicy because I have an allergy to capsaicin and received a roll that clearly looked like it had something spicy on it. My brother tested it for me and it was so spicy he had to spit it out. When we could finally get one of the servers to acknowledge us, they didn't want to replace it or comp it until I asked for a manager who simply wordlessly pulled the roll off the table and waved his hand at us.  Even the sashimi sucked. It tasted like it had been soaked in some sort of chemical.  This place is terrible in every regard."}
{"text":"I can't really leave a review. I showed up at 245 to grab a late lunch. They were all hanging around having a laugh. Then they told me they were closed. Sign on the door said closed at 3. Not closed at 2:45. Seems like just lazy staff to me. If the want to stop taking orders earlier to prepare for dinner, then they should change their hours on the door."}
{"text":"A solid three stars. I came here on a whim with my Not Boyfriend (it's complicated, ok?). We got a large Kirin and hot sake for $5 which you can't beat! For food I ordered white tuna, octopus, and salmon nigiri. The salmon and tuna were spot on. The octopus not so much. It came with some kind of seasoning on top that I wasn't a huge fan of, and was so chewy I couldn't get it down. The quail eggs we got were ok- no spice added like some places so we added some Siracha for a flavor boost. I got tempura udon which was delicious and perfect for the freezing (by Arizona standards) weather. Against my better judgement, I ordered some rolls as well. Not that rolls are terrible they're just not as traditional as what I would normally order. The salmon skin roll was ok, again a little too chewy. The Philadelphia Roll was boring and I thought had a bit too much rice for the amount of other ingredients.   One standout part of the meal was the service, our server was super sweet and attentive. We didn't realize they closed at 830 but once we saw them putting up chairs we figured it out. Having worked in the service industry I know how closing time can be and they did a great job of not making us feel unwelcome or rushing through the meal. Overall, go for the sake bomb special, stay for the fresh fish. Avoid the rolls."}
{"text":"ORdered food to go. Two bowls and a miso ramen. Bulgogi tasted good but I expected more for the price I paid."}
{"text":"This place has such a good variety from sushi to bento boxes and some delicious hot soups. So far ive tried the chanpon if yoi are into seafood soups and the a tonkotsu ramen is also very good if you feel adventurous. The broth is just to get it another and another time. Ive had the i love salmon roll and  it was served fresh and basic but it was just mmm... Also the chicken teriaki is white meat and it was very good to my taste and came. With veggi tempura a side salad and a cali with a miso soup. Prices are very reasonable. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Very good! I had the chicken curry bowl and it was delicious. Friend had the Korean BBQ box and she said it was yummy! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Extremely nice, amazing, courtesy service. The ramen and the sushi were delicious. Try the shrimp popcorn roll if you like some crunch! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I got the spicy pork bulgogi box and it was really good and filling! The only thing That bothered me about this place was that there were some strands of fuzz in our tempura and under the California rolls."}
{"text":"This place makes rocking ramen, you have to try the yellowtail special-it has a nice blend of flavors with a spicy kick, this will be my regular from now on"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place due to the great reviews and how the food looked in the pictures on yelp. We ordered a spicy bulgogi bento box, a tonkatsu ramen, and the baked scallop roll. The tonkatsu arrived first and was okay. I didn't have high expectations but was kind of put off by the fact that you could still see the broth powder that they hadn't mixed in. The bento box arrived next with pork bulgogi that was lukewarm at best. Finally the scallop roll arrived and was the most disappointing. Normally baked rolls are well...baked. The scallops on top were warm but the rolls underneath were cold as if they had just come out of the fridge. My guess is that they probably torched the scallops on top with a of the rolls to give it a 'baked' appearance in order to save time but it gave it a burnt flavor. The only plus was that the waitress was super nice and helpful with explaining the items on the menu. Maybe we just came on a bad day or ordered the wrong items."}
{"text":"Eat here once per week at least.  Perfect casual sushi joint.  Great quality and friendly owner who takes pride in his work."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley. We eat here at least once a week. Great food and great service. The owner brings his passion into everything he makes."}
{"text":"I've been here for years now. They always have the exact beer I want and their service is the best you could ask for. Shinji and Brian have hands down the best recommendations and customer service you could ask for. There is no other sushi establishment in Phoenix that rivals how personable this restaurant is. Whether you're looking for a place to chill or you're just looking for a quick bite check out the awesome lunch specials under Bento Boxes. Always sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Great place for bento boxes and the sushi is delicious. The staff is friendly and it is a great place for dates or a work lunch.  The chefs are definitely good at what they do, every thing that I've ordered from here has come out as good as I would have wanted. The tempura is also amazing."}
{"text":"Good food, TERRIBLE SERVICE! And I'm typically pretty easy to please. I've never complained about service anywhere else and I've never written another negative Yelp review. Two servers (college-age guys) for 12 or so tables in this small place. Our main server wasn't trying very hard at all. Brought us sushi on plates, but didn't bring us plates to eat off of or small dishes to pour soy sauce into (pretty standard things for a sushi. Did not refill water. Did not check on how our meal was going. Did not have any idea that we had been done with our meal for more than 10 minutes. I had to go up and ask for the bill. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi! Shrimp tempura and fried Cali rolls are delicious  the music is oldies and the atmosphere is quite and perfect for a solo date."}
{"text":"Tucked in amongst the chains, this is a deliciously chill little sushi spot.  We loved the Cinco de Mayo roll, which was unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Great service, and good food. Ramen is hard to find in Phoenix, but they do a pretty good job. Their sushi is tasty too. They also offer sake with any beer you buy! I'll be going back, it's in an easy location right off the freeway."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant and best of all, they have amazing lunch specials! They give you the best bang for your buck without sacrificing quality. Also, fast and friendly service. If you're in north Phoenix looking for great sushi, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! I have had the crunchy cali rolls and my husband had the salmon rolls, both were outstanding. And the saki bombs are cheap and delicious, what more could you ask for?! The employee that I have met is super helpful and very accurate even though he is usually very busy."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. The service we received was horrible. We were checked on twice the almost hour we were there. Food took awhile to be served. Our sushi was warm. Just overall not a good experience. Highly doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"Fist time i was there about 3 weeks ago for lunch and the food was excellent. 2nd time I came not so good. 3rd time excellent Ramon was delicious. Rolls were very good. Very nice"}
{"text":"Try the Bento Box for Dinner with Sliced Beef. Amazing. They also have iced green tea.... yeah.  So happy to find this place in North Phoenix, Norterra.   Family run, service was great, lots of locals. There is Cold Stone next door for dessert after and a Starbucks too.   Bill for two was $35 - not bad. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I've been here a couple times now and the sushi is on par with the super expensive restaurants. I've tried several different rolls and the chef has even made something special for me when I asked. The fish is always fresh and flavorful and the tempura is awesome. The owners are very nice and friendly and made me feel like family. Excellent place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Once again an amazing day and service at bento box!!! Me and my boyfriend come in at least once a week and sit at our table right up front!! This is also where me and him had our first date!! Love the place love the people. Very happy with Bento Box, as usual."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu for rolls. For 2 rolls it's $8.95 and $12.95 for 3. They have a special roll menu for this lunch special. I got the shrimp tempura roll and salmon roll. My complain about the shrimp tempura roll is that it was just DRENCHED in eel sauce!  My boyfriend got the salmon teriyaki box which came with salad, rice, tempura, and California roll. I was not a fan of their California roll, too much mayo.   All in all, decent place."}
{"text":"Came by around 5 for a quick bite of sushinom and was not disappointed. Rice was perfect, everything tasted fresh and clean. I got squid salad, tea, cali roll, tuna, and rainbow roll. A little bit spendy but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was so amazing great good, great prices . Check it out. I got a bento box and it had a lot of food."}
{"text":"First time visit.  My hubby wanted a coffee from Starbucks and we had a horrible lunch in Scottsdale several hours earlier so I was left hanging.  I decided to waddle over and get a roll. I asked the waitress for a suggestion.  She asked me how I like it and concluded that the Climax roll would be appropriate.  It was great. I sat outside while my hubby enjoyed his coffee with me. The service was good.  My check with a tip was $15 which is reasonable to me. I will be back."}
{"text":"Beware at lunch time... If you are on the clock, order ahead of time by phone and then come in. It took very long to get our order in and the food.   There is only one server who, bless her heart, is overwhelmed. I felt bad for her. She kept her cool and worked steadily.   I got the spicy chicken and hubs got the spicy pork. I have to say, I liked the pork better. Next time, I'll get the pork :)  The salad, Gyoza and California roll was good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price, the only downside is it's really popular and the location is small."}
{"text":"Love this place the sushi is great but they do not answer their phone or just hang up on you if you call back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We love Bento box, the food is great and it's a perfect local joint. The chef always welcomes you with a hello and says goodbye when you leave. You feel like the truly care that you picked them to spend your money at. The green tea is awesome! Unlike other green teas. Great fresh made sushi and large bento boxes."}
{"text":"Horrific service. We didn't even try the food. We left after 15 minutes of sitting there with no drink service."}
{"text":"Came in for some sushi but I felt like more of a after thought. I sat at the sushi bar since it was just myself and I didn't want to take a entire table.  The waiter didn't offer anything to drink till after the sushi chef brought food.  I also had to wait for the sushi chef to notice me to take my order.  Then halfway through my meal the waiter asks if I want something to drink and the sushi chef asked if I wanted soup. Which normally is offered right away... I felt like a total after thought. I give it 3 stars because the 2 rolls special was decent and not a terrible price. Not sure I will come again though."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch and we're so impressed that we brought our son yeaterday.  The service and quality of food is outstanding.  Entries are made fresh to order. The Salmon teriyaki Bento Box is awesome, and so is their cucumber salad."}
{"text":"Very good meal. The two people running the place are a delight. Had a sake bomb tempura salad miso soup Spicy tuna roll all excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and a couple times I have placed a to go order. The food is usually spectacular, hence the reason I have been coming back but tonight was horrible. If this was my first time I would never be back. The table was dirty and sticky. My daughter is in a high chair and we put her food on the table so she could eat. We had to wipe it off with a wipe before we could do that. The service was terrible. We waited 10 minutes to place our drink orders. My husband got the shrimp tempura but the shell was still on the shrimp so he had to peel it off himself. He said that it was a nuisance and all of the sauce that would have been on the shrimp got taken off with the shell. I got the caterpillar roller. I was half way through the roller when I realized there was still plastic on it. It must have been from when they were rolling it. My husband and I were both out of water after finishing our edamame and it wasn't refilled until I finally got a chance to ask her when I was almost done with my meal. That is also when my husband reminded her that he ordered a sake bomb that she didn't bring out. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. I don't know if we will be back. If we do it'll only be for lunch."}
{"text":"So I wasnt really a big fan of sushi before my girlfriend introduced to bento box.... Got to say, I like sushi now and it's all thanks to bento box and, Me giving into my girlfriends want for sushi all the time."}
{"text":"Went in today because they looked like they were open and got the chicken karraage, dragon roll and baked lobster roll. Everything was really good and served pretty quick. Definitely worth checking out if you want some sushi on this side of town, where there doesn't appear to be too many places serving it."}
{"text":"The staff was so precious and helpful and the sushi was Great. Especially for the price! I only have to change rating to 3 stars because after my initial review I came back and found 3 hairs in the same sushi roll."}
{"text":"Have been here several times since they opened. They have already increased their prices and changed to a sit down restaurant from fast food with option to sit. It's definitely more chaotic in the front and the kitchen. They have forgotten that appitizers and soup come before the main meal. Food is still good. I hope service improves soon."}
{"text":"Bento box is a small cozy place our family's favorite sushi stop. The bento boxes are also fantastic."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much out of this place but ended up being pleasantly surprised. The sushi tasted fresh and flavorful. When you order sashimi they bring out a fresh wasabi concoction I've never had before that was outstanding. This place is definitely worth visiting for affordable, quality sushi."}
{"text":"OK, I may be landlocked in the middle of the AZ desert (Dante's Inferno)...but this little dive has to be some of the tastiest sushi I have had. The salmon is the star if the show...just sweet, fresh and melts in your mouth. Gives my local sushi dive a run for it's $$. All the fish was as fresh as it gets, amazing for Phoenix of all places. This is a GREAT little dive and I highly recommend it if in the hood. Only thing is it is buried in the food court area across the parking lot from Lowe's in the Happy Valley Town Center. I had to ask security where it was."}
{"text":"The sushi is good and the waitress is fantastic. The sushi chef, however, decided it was a good idea to talk about us in his native tongue with other patrons from apparently the same motherland not realizing I was eating dinner with a linguist. I would have loved to give a better review, but that type of service is not appropriate. Sushi catcher is so much better and the sushi is better."}
{"text":"Very good. Very friendly staff. Orgasm role was Amazing! I sat at the sushi bar and they were very helpful. They knew this Texas boy could handle some heat in his sushi."}
{"text":"He was right, things weren't very happy in Happy Valley...  Rainy disagreeable Tuesday months back and a late, late lunch date. Curse you, lunch date! so I sit and pout. (A little drama on a rainy day in the desert goes a long way.) I order a sake bomber. Silence falls. A cheery couple yapping it up - they pause to look over at me as the giant beer comes my way. Yes, I'm alone. Giant beer. And sake. All for me!   And because I'm focused on them so obviously admiring my giant weekday beverage, DUCK! I duck left from an ear level \"ssssssZzzk\" hiss and I instinctively dodge low because I sense that something has launched itself from my table to the ceiling way across the room. It scared the Kirin out of me!   Haha! This server (the owner) has just unleashed the beer by launching the cap with a pair of wooden chopsticks. Drama!   Now, I myself have opened a 12 ounce bottle of beer on the structural part of a Toyota Celica convertible roof (a strange and desperate time at Joshua Tree National Park) so I will say, I was genuinely impressed and delighted with this little unexpected show of skill. Just then, my late, late lunch date  walked in, the happy admirers turned around and we all went on to enjoy some fine fresh fish. And yes, the bomber was shared!   The place is strip mall spectacular! Translates to: small and simple - maybe not \"destination\" nor \"special date night,\" but dependable and yummy. I've enjoyed all the sushi eats here  recommend also the pork bulgolgi bowl just because it's so good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly now for about 6-7 months and this place was my favorite lunch stop up until about 2 weeks ago. I'm not sure if it's because they're getting busier or what but the quality has dropped drastically. When I came for lunch with my husband 2 weeks ago the food was not great for him or I, but considering how much I've enjoyed this place I chalked it up to an off day. I ordered two different rolls for lunch today and was not impressed...they tasted identical and were not put together very well, they were loose with bare minimal ingredients."}
{"text":"Most times when we travel we look for a Japanese restaurant. I was also craving Korean food too. Well here at Bento Box you can get the best of both worlds! So convenient! Did they know we were coming?  Because we were from out of state and not familiar with this area Yelp steered us to the wrong location! Darn it someone laid that pointer down incorrectly!!! I had to call the restaurant again. First time to make reservations. Secondly we were lost can you tell us where you're located?  It was more apparent bc the first time we drove behind that strip mall of restaurants! Duh. They were located across from Lowe's!  We actually were here to meet a Yelper friend Vickie who moved out here just recently. We only had just met last year at a couple UYEs but had enjoyed Vickie's company. It was a fun and entertaining night to meet her bf too. Her bf learned a new way to open a bottle of beer from our waiter. We were actually quite taken ourselves! You think we were drinking champagne from the pop off sound of the cap from the bottle of the beer!!!  My miso soup tasted perfect as well as the spicy pork bulgogi. Even though I thought my vegetable tempora tasted different or odd but it could have been my taste buds. The gyoza was good as well as the California roll. Hubby had the yakisoba and he said it was delicious. I never got around to trying his food. Story of my life! Lol Derek enjoyed his Kirin beer as well as chicken teriyaki bowl. Vickie loved her chicken teriyaki bento box too.  Would we come back? Not sure if we would on this trip. Be aware that this restaurant is small so reservations are advisable. Parking was plentiful and bathrooms were decent. They do have a baked lobster sushi roll I was eyeing as well as ramen, oyakodon and tempora ice cream. Dang I now got to get some coconut or salted caramel ice cream to satisfy my sweet tooth. Where can I find that at five in the morning? I know my best writing is fresh in the morning! Lol"}
{"text":"Best Vegas roll ever. Fish was fresh and delicious. This is a family run business.   Go here and support your local business.  They do an amazing job of quality service and value. My new go to when in the area."}
{"text":"Really good food, been coming here for 2 years now and have no plans of stopping! Try the Las Vegas Roll!"}
{"text":"Opened 2 months, this place is exactly what I expect from a fast Japanese restaurant. Prices are good and not overpriced like Kawaii Japanese restaurant. Food was delicious. I had salmon Bento box, $10.95 and well worth every penny. It came with salmon, rice, tempura vegetables, (unexpected) pieces of chicken fried with sweet sauce, a little potato salad, salad, and a fruit (cantaloupe).  So good! I might even stop on the way home to pick up some dinner it was so good.  I recommended it to 2 coworkers already today. It is a lot more Japanese and the menu far more extensive than the competitor Yogi's across Happy Valley Rd.  I would say this is like a fast version of Sakana Sushi on 59th Ave & Loop 101.  5/5 stars for sure.  I hope they start advertising and getting more people in there because it's hard to see it unless you drive right by.  It's next to L&L Hawaiian which was closed for just today, so that made me try Bento Box.  Timing is everything sometimes.  The food is a lot more healthy than (still delicious) L&L Hawaiian."}
{"text":"So this place is a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant.  I guess it doesn't matter as long as they know how to make the food, right?  The hubs went to order as the boy and I sat at a table.  The hubs and the guy at the register hit it off and did some small talk - he was really friendly.  We ordered 2 of the ramen noodle bowls.  It took about 15-20 before they came out.  The bowl was just okay.  Nothing too tasty and a little bland.  I wish they didn't have the wooden chopsticks that you break apart to eat the ramen - it definitely didn't make the ramen taste any better.  We will come back and try out the sushi next time and who knows, maybe their ramen will be better, too. It's a new place so we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. Rice bowl took 45 minutes to arrive after delayed ordering. Rice bowl consisted of huge glob of White rice and about a dozen thin bland precut chicken strips without any vegetables for $8.00. Many other Asian restaurants do a much better job for much less money. Our advice is to skip this place. See photo."}
