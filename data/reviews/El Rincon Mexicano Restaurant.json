{"text":"We've been searching for excellent Mexican since Dos Amigos closed and we've found it! Maybe I'll be able to convince them to add Mole Chicken but the Chorizo tacos were awesome and the Churros really hit the spot. BTW...the guacamole is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went to El Rincón Mexicano to celebrate Mexican independence day tonight and I'm pleased to say that after trying a few \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants (see my other reviews), I've finally found one that truly is authentic. The decor is bright and typically Mexican and the patio out back, while a bit chilly tonight, is surely great in warmer weather. 

We started with an order of sopes (like mini, open-faced soft tacos with extra thick tortillas) and some guacamole. Both were on par with what I used to eat when I lived in Mexico City. My wife ordered the pozole and said it was the best she's had in Toronto and almost as good as our favourite place in Mexico (which even by Mexican standards was very hard to beat). I had the flautas (deep fried rolled tacos) and they were quite tasty, especially with the house hot sauce. I've built up a tolerance to spiciness and I normally order the absolute spiciest thing at restaurants and am usually disappointed. This was not the case at El Rincón Mexicano. They put 2 different sauces on the table, one was a chipotle sauce which was ok but I'm not a big chipotle fan in general. The other was made with habanero peppers and it was very hot. Like my mouth was on fire after eating it hot. I loved it. The only thing I didn't like was the rice. It was overcooked.

My only complaint would be the slow service. While our server was very pleasant and was able to offer suggestions from the menu, she was overworked. There were only 2 servers working on a big night for any Mexican restaurant and they were really running. It took about half an hour for our food to arrive and when it did one main course arrived about 5min after the appetizers, another main course arrived 5min after that, then our friends had to wait another 10min for their main courses. 

I will definitely go back to El Rincón Mexicano on a slower night so I can try more things and let the flavours help me not miss Mexico so much."}
{"text":"went here for dinner and ordered the baja tacos lamb and pork as well both would not get again but the baja were very good The pitcher of margaritas was awesome but 47$ the food came in 5 min way too fast in our books we felt rushed the popcorn was a waste 4$ for a tiny bag and the pickled jalapeños are not what we expected also not recommended. 

all in all the fish tacos are good and the drinks  as well but you will end up leaving spending a lot cause it's tapas style"}
{"text":"Many of my friends love this place, but I've gone a couple times and each time the staff was a little unfriendly and the food was pretty medium. Not at all terrible, but definitely not my favourite Mexican plac"}
{"text":"Ok, we came back for a second time. The food is acceptable. The first time we dined during the week. There were 8 tables and 2 servers and 2 tables occupied. Service was annoyingly slow. The second time we dined on the weekend. This time there were 3 servers. We ordered drinks and our meal. Our meal came quickly but our drinks???? After my husband got up several times to alert the waitress that we still did not have our beverages, our food got cold, our tortillas dried out and finally our drinks came. Really? The table next to us waited 15+ minutes before someone took their order? I don't know how others feel but when we go out we like a relaxing environment and we want to be served. We don't want to fight for our food or bev. Even though I like the food we will not be going back. Who needs the aggravation. That is not what dining out is about!  Educate your staff to run your establishment correctly. Thumbs down on our overall experience. And in my last review I mentioned that this is not authentic Mexican food. The website should take the word AUTHENTIC out of its description. If you want acceptable food and an aggravating experience GO. The food is not disappointing but make sure you beg for additional sauce... They are not offered."}
{"text":"We've been to El Rincon a few times over the last few years, and every time we wonder why we waited so long to go back.  The food is as authentic as we've had anywhere in Toronto, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the prices reasonable (though not inexpensive).  The service tends to be a little slow - this is not the place to go for a quick meal, but it is great for a relaxing meal over a couple of hours."}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was exceptionally short, because our initial greeting when we walked into the restaurant was so poor that I didn't care to stick around to find out how terrible the service actually is. Therefore, my one star rating has nothing to do with the food, but rather the disappointing welcome we received upon arrival.

I had been wanting to try this place for over a year, but rarely do I find myself in that neighborhood. Victoria Day rolled around and my partner and I decided to stop in for a bite before heading to a holiday party. When we walked in, only two out of the eight(ish) tables in the place were occupied. We requested a table on the patio, but were told it was full. When we told the waitress (there's no hostess), that we wouldn't mind sitting inside, she told us abruptly that we couldn't. They couldn't seat us because they were too busy. Again, please note that there were at least six empty tables. She said it would be 30 minutes before she could seat us and take our food order.

We weren't in a rush, so we asked if we could sit at one of the six unoccupied tables to have a beer while we waited. She looked at us like we'd asked for a million dollars and replied \"No, I can't do that\". I guess it was too much to ask of her to crack a couple of bottles of Corona.

Feeling very unwelcome, we decided not to stick around and risk terrible service. So I left feeling quite disappointed having gone all the way up there. 
Perhaps the food is amazing, but a restaurant is only as good as the staff that work there, and these staff were nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"I like the patio out back. A kid friendly place. I'm giving it three stars because of the hour long wait for food. 
I want to find a good Mexican restaurant that also has good service (ie not El Sol)"}
{"text":"Went to El Rincon and was amazing!
Lets Start with the Service, one of a kind we 
Were kindly greeted and served immediately place was busy but that did not matter, they gave us a table right away even though we didnt make a reservation.
Food was the best part. Big portions, great flavor and it just tasted like mexico. Guacamole is a must and tacos are fantastic. Overall a great place to go. Ill be coming back especially for the patio."}
{"text":"Great place if you are feeling spicy Mexican food.  The food is quite flavorful and in decent quantities.  The guacamole was amazing!.  word to the wise, there is a BIG difference between medium and hot.  The hot rivals the 10 spice at salad king.  location is pretty easy to get to via subway.  St. Clair is a pain in the car.  
There is a back patio which is just perfect in the summer heat.

Side note:
There is a Dutch ice cream place 2 blocks away which is a great way to cool off after a spicy meal."}
{"text":"Nice place, multicolored walls. Great tasty food. 
Will consider coming back again.
I had the vegetarian tacos and it was so good."}
{"text":"I went here because of the other reviews, but was pretty surprised to find that the service wasn't unusually bad.  I found it to be pretty much the same as any other restaurant.

As for the food - I had the chicken and lime soup, and it was good.  After that, I had the beef flautas, and they were okay as well.  The meat was incredibly flavourful, but a little dry for my tastes.  

The rice side dish was good as well, but i was really too full to eat much of it, given the soup and the flautas."}
{"text":"Saw it on food network, happy I tried it, very nice place,cozy friendly and excellent good service. Food was ahsome I give them a 10 star review, keep up the excelent work."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I could spend hours on their back patio during the summer.

What really differentiates El Rincon for me from other Mexican places in the city is the staff. I always have a great experience with the servers and the kitchen staff. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We saw this place as an option to try one lunchtime as the rain started and we were hungry.
From the moment we entered the friendly waitress apologised twice for keeping us waiting while she cleaned a recently vacated table. Her attitude and friendliness was really appreciated and she explained that the restaurant cooked to order and there would be a wait for food to arrive. You could feel her passion for the food.
We ordered the lime soup and guacamole to start. Both delicious and large servings. The hot sauce that came, complimented the avacado perfectly.
For mains we ordered empanadas and steak Mexican style. Both were good sized portions and delicious. Seeing how I enjoyed the hot sauce so much the waitress brought me some 'very' hot sauce to try with my main. Warning; she said it was too hot for her!
Overall, the food, service and ambience was great. They have a downstairs dining area that was closed and looked a little gloomy and a terrace area out back (Also closed). Would definitely return with friends to try the margaritas on the terrace! Recommended."}
{"text":"Service is super slow and they are just indifferent to your needs.  Guacomole is good but everything else is bland.  Chicken was dry and they use feta cheese on everything....not very authentic.  Not a must try!"}
{"text":"Decor in El Rincon is very nice, and the service was prompt.  Myself and one other group of 2 were in the restaurant at the time.  There might have been more people on the patio....not too sure.  My food was tasty and was plentiful.  I can honestly say I enjoyed the experience, but I have to say it isn't the best Mexican food I have ever had.  I enjoyed it, and took my time eating and enjoying my food.  It was a bit cramped in there, so I don't think I would recommend coming with a large group of people."}
{"text":"Good but not great. They have a patio out back that is bright and fun when it is warm. There are several tables downstairs (in addition to the ones out front)  to retreat to if it starts raining but they all seem to close to the bathroom. The Soapas were not worth it but everything else fills your greasy Canadian Mexican food requirements. It is a little more expensive than you'd want for the quality but it is close so..."}
{"text":"After a long rough week at work, my bf and I decided to go to  cozy neighbourhood restaurant for a delicious meal and a drink but we were sorely disappointed at the quality of food. I ordered a burrito but it looked stale and it smelled bad. Normally, if the food doesnt taste the best but it's still quality ingredients, I would suck it up and eat it but here they are essentially disrespecting their customers by serving sub par food and charging an arm and a leg. In my life, I have sent food back twice and this was the second time. Although the staff handled it very well and didn't charge me for my entree but I am not sure if I will be going back. Sorry :("}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. Awful in so many ways.  My veggie taco came with broccoli and califlower, barf.  That's not authentic.  My husband's chicken taco tasted like nothing else other than Ketchup.  We had to ask the waitress for so things that we ordered such as the salsa and chips.

We will never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in my neighbourhood for a while but I've never tried it until now. Food was delicious and the service was amazing! Me and my friends were all talking about how it's so rare these days to get genuine and kind good customer service (which is sad). But yes, the chips and salsa and my burrito were really tasty. The waitresses were really sweet and helpful with explaining he different items on the menu. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Service slow. Food was OK - adequately spicy. Prices unreasonable. 5 mini tacos for 15.95$?? Like you could eat 10 of them and still be hungry. And all that's on them is a two tablespoons of meat and some chopped onions. Best part was the patio which was festive and spacious. 

BEER: A pint of Amsterdam was 7.95$. It should be half that. What kind of Mexican bullshit is this??? 

A Mexican friend recommended me this place last week and I've been cursing him all afternoon (in Spanish) but now realize he was talking about a spot by Oakwood (not Wychwood - Latin Fiesta @ 1002 St. Clair). So my bad, Juan-Pablo, my bad.

Lunch for two and three beers was 55$. Dios mio. Dios mio.

Note: El Trompo in Kensington is much better, I think."}
{"text":"I ordered fish tacos and they told me to wait for 30 min. I do not know why it took so long and their tacos fell apart. Tortilla should not be torn. I thought they were pricey. The girls who worked there were very nice and pleasant. Inside the restaurant was nice and had Mexican atmosphere."}
{"text":"agree with some reviewers. Food was bland, nothing special. was really looking forward to having good mexican food but I've honestly had better tacos at Taco bell. Guacamole lacked a good lime/cilantro taste, rest of the food was room temp and didnt even have a good spice blend or spice kick. Service was ok. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this little Mexican place! Large servings of delicious plates, getting all the dishes I'd associate with Mexican cuisine. Guacamole dip and Michelada drinks to start. Empanadas and tacos for our main with deep fried ice cream for dessert. Our servers were very friendly and helpful, walking us through the dishes and making recommendations. The area around it is a little run down, but the place filled up quickly - definitely consider reserving a table! Very excited to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner before a Raptor game.  He had seen the restaurant on \"You gotta eat here\" and because we love Mexican food we wanted to check it out.  The service was friendly.  The fresh guacamole was delicious but I found the chips to be quite thick and not thin crispy which I prefer.  The fish tacos were good but not spectacular.  My husband order the dish from the show which was not listed on the menu which is served in a black stone bowl which kept the cheese warm.  It was a nice presentation of meats."}
{"text":"I tried. I really did. The service is terrible, the food is slow and uninspired, bland and overpriced.

Came with my kids, and after waiting 15 minutes (there were 4 tables including ours with 2 servers, a manager and 2 people in the kitchen) to have our order taken they serve the table behind us that sat down 5-10 minutes after us! I ask if we can order and she says she'll be right back. That was a lie.

I order and the server cannot comprehend basic \"salsa on the side\". It is repeated many, many times. We have to have a discussion about what this means; there is pico and salsa listed on the menu for the dish. She has apparently never read the menu? Dish comes with salsa al over. She argues with me when I point it out, and when I say \"we had a whole conversation about it\" she admits the kitchen made a mistake. Ya, I know. But charge me full price, why don't you?

Underripe tomatoes. Guacamole tastes rancid - I give it back and tell her (politely, quietly) that the guac tastes off and she very thoughtfully charges me anyway for inedible guacamole. We sent the whole order back and got charged?

Fish tacos are dripping with grease and include half a too big \"shred\" of cabbage and the vein of the tilapia intact so I get to also enjoy improperly prepared, under seasoned fish (there's a reason to cut that vein our - IT TASTES BAD) to go with the rotten guac I paid for. Great. The other dishes were okay, but it took FIFTY minutes to be served - table that came in after us was leaving as we got our food. It cost almost $90 and we had one app and only water plus four mediocre mains. I get it is homemade (not sure which part?) but it sucked and was super expensive. The service was bizarre and only adept at ignoring us or smiling. I have no idea how it was on a tv show for anything other than a restaurant makeover program. What a shame."}
{"text":"Nice patio and laid back atmosphere but if the staples of Mexican food are missing it makes for a disappointing experience.  Guacamole was fresh but bland and I asked for a side of chopped Serrano or jalapeño and got a small bowl of canned jalapeños.  Ouch!  So I asked for salsa and tried the hottest - the azteca.  It was medium hot to hot but without flavor.  Margaritas were ok.  Tacos again without much flavor.  The service was slow as I had read in previous reviews.  I can forgive service issues if the meal is good.  It's a nice neighborhood location so I hope they hire an experienced Mexican chef to fix the essentials."}
{"text":"Came for a friends surprise birthday party, having read the previous negative reviews. I decided to go in with an open mind and no expectations.

Decor is typical Mexican kitsch which seems to be par for most Mexican places in Toronto with a few exceptions. Friends had a great time posing with the sombreros hanging on the wall in the basement. 

Because we were a party of 20, food of course took forever, but we were somewhat forgiving as this is expected for any large order in the restaurant. Wait staff were friendly and helpful in arranging for the surprise. Waiting to pay also took forever as everyone had separate bills but again this is no fault of theirs. 

I should at least mention the food... The 5 taco combo was a bit small, and one in our party was complaining about it, as those that got enchiladas. A friend got the burrito, which got envious stares from those with smaller portions. I got the sizzling fajita with beef, which had generous portions as well, served with tortillas kept moist with a box and cloth. No complaints about the fajita, it seems to be one of the better deals here."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after it was featured on the TV show \"You Gotta Eat Here\". I tried the chicken empanadas and regular nachos. The nachos were really good but the empanadas were just OK. I'd rather go to Jumbo Empanadas in Kensington Market. The dishes were very greasy. Service was extremely SLOW!! There seemed to be only 1 waitress for both floors of the restaurant. We were in the basement (which was very cramped /hot/stuffy). The entrees came out within 30 mins of us ordering. The dessert took nearly 50 mins to come out .... We only ordered 1 churro stick(it was good but quite small and cost $4.00)! Everything was over priced. The waitress was nice but was unable to check in with us often as she had to tend to the other customers upstairs as well. Unfortunately I will not be returning to this restaurant. It did not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican food a couple weeks ago and my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. He's spanish and was born and raised outside of Canada and for him he really enjoyed this place, as did I. 

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service wasn't top notch. There was only one server, not sure if they were short staffed or not but it took some time for us to get our order in. 

Once the order was placed the food came out pretty quickly, and the portions are great. We had order refried beans, tortilla soup and guacamole as an app and we were full off just those! 

We will be back to try some entrees!"}
{"text":"Took forever for the food and the shrimp We ordered was clearly old ( so fishy ) ..alsoeverything was overpriced  .. This food is no where near authentic and tastes very bad ..Go elsewhere.. if there was 0 star i would choose that :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  casual, bright, colorful with Mexican decor (big suns on the wall, wooden tables, etc). Maybe a dozen tables inside?  The best part, however, is the back enclosed patio.  On my second visit, we sat out here for brunch and it was one of my happiest memories.  (okay, mainly for the food, but the nice warmth out there was wonderful too).

Service:  Good (first visit).  We arrived at 12:05 to find the door still locked, with their opening time of 12, but the girl was less than a minute to let us in.  She was the only human we saw.  Two of us were the only customers for the first 15-20 minutes, then a family of four arrived, and no one else for the hour-ish we were there.  I figured it was a FRIGID January Sunday, most people not in the mood to venture outside.  (second visit: much of the same).

Menu:  Nom nom nom!!  I could tell from looking at the menu online, that I would have no trouble finding something to order.  We were especially hungry upon arrival, which makes it even harder to pick something when most things on the menu sound good.  Started with drinks (mango & lime frozen margaritas with 1.5 oz tequila - very good).  Cheese fondue appetizer was AMAZING.  Mozzerella (strange) came in a small bowl with warm, soft tortillas to dip, pico de gallo on the side.  I cannot explain this, but I put the cheese & pico in a tortilla to eat taco-style, and it tasted similar to a Big Mac to me.  It was almost overwhelming.  I do not get this.  Firstly, I'm vegetarian and haven't had a Big Mac in a long time.  But the specific flavor I do remember, and even though this didn't have any Big Mac ingredients, it was awesome to me.  I've tried to duplicate it at home and failed miserably a few times.  Entrees:  the veg Enfrijotadas were incredible.  I don't know really what separates them from an enchilada, maybe that they were soft tortillas, with beans & cheese on top vs ONLY cheese?  The peppers, zuchini & cauliflower inside were cooked to perfection.  Side of delicious Mex rice (which had a slight chicken flavor, unfortunate for me, but I didn't say anything), and other side of salad with the 3 stuffed tortillas.  I was painfully full, but forced myself to clean the plate, as it was too good.  The other person with me ordered the Camarones Infierno and said it was amazing.  (tiger shrimp sauteed in homemade extra hot sauce with rice, salad & tortillas).  There was a lot of the sauce leftover after the shrimps were eaten, so you could take this to go and use it as a chip/bread dip later in the day if you wanted.   Fried ice cream for dessert was about par with what you'd expect - a big scoop of vanilla with choice of chocolate/caramel/strawberry sauce, fresh strawberries on top. 

Would I go back??? OH yes.  Grateful this is not in my neighborhood or I may have a new addiction."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef enchiladas and they were absolutely first rate.  My only complaint was that the rice and beans that came with the dish were very small in terms of their portions.  Nevertheless, I found the food to be pleasant tasting and the service was very friendly.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My partner and I went there for brunch a few days ago.  We were walking on St Clair hoping to get some brunch and the place seemed appealing.  Since it was open at around midday on a Saturday we assumed they would have brunch.  Well, they don't have a brunch menu which was sad, however we stayed as the regular menu seemed tasty.  
The food was good, particularly the Guacamole, very fresh tasting & creamy.  It had bits of hot green peppers that were sometimes quite hot. 
The Cafe the Olla was very good, tasted the same as in Mexico, bringing back memories.  :) 
The mains were good (not great but good).  The side rice was just ok.  However they have Esquites and other authentic Mexican dishes in the Menu that I can't wait to try.  
Service was good.

(Mexican breakfast/brunch Menu -huevos rancheros, huevos divorciados, chilaquiles, etc- would make it better)."}
{"text":"Would have given 4 stars but not this time.
Have eaten inside here about 10-12 times and my wife does take out here often.
Menu has changed and is different from online....Anyways we are hungry.
Ordered drinks, starters and mains for 6 people maybe 16 or so items... 15 of 16 as ordered but my order of beef tacos came as chicken. This sucks since its my turn to pay. I was hungry and to be honest maybe I wasn't clear? Did some at the table sharing/swaping and all good. One of my guests has a high heat requirement and El Rincon delivered.
The tip is built into the bill (at more than 15%). Not sure exactly but $41 on $230? I automatically tip 15% and more, if we don't order drinks. The terminal shouldn't prompt for a tip if it's included. Anyways... A good meal and guests were pleased."}
{"text":"* I have only tried this restaurant via Uber Eats

What was ordered:

- Chorizo Enchiladas
- Churros
- Flan
- Tacos de Carne Asada
- Nachos

Ok, so the enchiladas and the tacos were crap. They looked great, but there was no flavour! SO. EFFING. BLAND. Drowning it in the green and red sauce didn't do a damn thing. They really need way more seasoning.

Nachos were pretty good...it came soggy though but that's kind of expected with delivery so that didn't bother me.

Churros came extremely hard and too much cinnamon sugar..do not get these. It is a giant waste of money. 8 dollars for 2 fucking churros?!?!! really??? Oh oops sorry, I forgot about the quarter slice of a strawberry they gave us too. Guess that makes up for the 8 dollars. -_-
The flan was okay.

I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times before and was never really impressed, but liked the cozy backyard patio. The food always seemed overpriced for the amount and quality that they served. The service is quite slow, but I don't take points off for that unless they let my drink go dry without asking if I want another. 

I also think that all Mexican eateries should offer free tortilla chips and salsa. This place does not. Most places in Canada don't. But they should.

But last night we dined with my best friend's hungry Mexican husband and he verified the authenticity, but I had a few issues still.

Queso Fundito was ok. The cheese was very stringy and gooey, but tasty and served with flour tortillas.

Salsa was made of chipotles and very salty. I wish they would have brought the hot sauce earlier on in the game, because if you ask for it, it's really delicious-- and hot!

Steak tacos I had were loaded with meat. Not the best quality, but definitely well seasoned and there was fresh lime on the table. My friend's enchiladas were much smaller than the picture on the menu (beware, most of the items are, except for the tacos).  And they serve black beans with their entree instead of Pinto beans. This is the kiss of death for me and I'm making note of this because those fuckers rip my intestines up. I won't order an entree that includes sides here when I come back just for this reason. Her husband ordered 3 steak tacos and 3 al pastor. The al pastor was just pulled pork without pineapple, but he said the pork was ok.

I will probably come back here despite the ok food. It seems to be hit or miss, but never outright bad or disappointing. The patio is great. 

Points for the Margaritas. They had cocktail umbrellas!"}
{"text":"I had decent expectations considering the other reviews and that it was featured on Food Network, amongst other shows. 

The positives were that, despite being a small restaurant, room was made for our party of five fairly quickly. We were offered a bottle of water and our waitress took our drink orders. We wanted to try out the guacamole, but were informed they were out. We also asked for the chicken wings, and the same answer was provided... yikes. So, we got the corn dish which was quite delicious! I think that was $7.

Our main dishes were pretty good. I had an order of enchiladas and in asking for pico de gallo to be provided, ended up with jalapenos -- which came at a charge of $1.50. They were clearly the pickled jalapenos, which I'm not opposed too, but it was a weird thing to be charged for. 

The spicy level of the chicken burrito ordered by my partner was quite hot, but pretty tasty, so no complaints there. The size was substantial. 

The prices were very reasonable (just over $10/a main). As were were departing, we noticed that an adjacent table had a fresh order of guacamole. So weird! 

I don't know if it was a communication issue, but it was a bit frustrating to see...

I don't believe I'll be coming back. It's fine for what it is. :)"}
{"text":"I would not go back, ever. Diluted sangria that was mostly ice. $13 for guacamole but chintzy quantity. Overcooked, dried, flavorless wings... need I go on?
Way better places in Kensington market!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very polite, warm and helpful. Decor was nice. HOWEVER, food ranged from incredibly bland to disgusting disaster. Chorizo tacos had the least amount of meat it could possibly have and was quite bland. Fish tacos were swimming, and I mean swimming in oil. We were in denial that it was even oil because of how much was seeping out of the taco. Chorizo empanadas were edible and that's about it. Flavour was severely lacking, despite being covered in two types of sauce. Very disappointed. Has just about turned everyone off of tacos in general. May not be fair, but neither was a fairly expensive but bad meal."}
{"text":"Some quick facts off the gate:

*I am not Mexican but lived in Mexico for a few years. 

*The mother of one of my best friends used to own this joint about 20 years ago. 

*One of the cooks bought the place about 15 years ago, changed the name and turned it into a Mexican place. I have no idea what happened after that. 

*If you have sat on the patio, then you sat on the same spot where I spent many an afternoon playing fútbol. (!) 

Okay. Now that we are past that, remember, Mexican food is a very simple, delicious, peasant food. So in Canada it is generally ill advised to open an \"Authentic Mexican Restaurant\" because if you do, chances are you will find yourself out of business faster than you can say 'A mi me encanta el tequila!' 

Why? Because Westernized tastes clash with the concept behind Mexican cuisine. Canadians (and to a greater extend Americans) like to \"have more\" put into their food. For example, did you know that a real burrito is just beef and re-fried beans in a soft taco? That's it. That is a true and authentic Mexican dish. Now go to any so-called Mexican restaurants in Toronto and try find a burrito that has just that. You won't find it. Unless it was a tiny locals-only-hole-in-the-wall-pick-up-food-joint, since they would have to in order to keep prices low.

Why? 
A-) Canadians think Tex-Mex food is Mexican food. Which is not.  
B-) Canadians won't buy just a burrito. They expect their dishes to be \"filling\" or \"bigger,\" so restaurants are forced to add filler items like lettuce, cheese (?!), rice, salsa, avocado which are not authentic, in order to trick you into buying it, thus reinforcing point A-)
C-) Even if they sold the authentic burrito, the fair price point would be too low to make it a viable business model. Since they are so cheap to make. Why are they so cheap? Because they are peasant food. 

So, all Mexican restaurants in Toronto are lying to you because they want to sell you a simile of Mexican food and stay in business so they can send their kids to university. 

Now El Rincon is more or less authentic, although unfortunately leaning 'less' on the Authentic and 'more' on the Tex-Mex part. But they have to since in order to try to keep it semi-authentic, they have to raise their profit margins in order to pay their rent. Is the food good? Yes, it's alright. After all the real secret of Mexican food is in the sauces. The main dishes can sometimes be kind of bland. 

The decor looks like an authentic Mexican restaurant in a touristy area of Mexico and  the patio is a nice place to hang out at. I sat there a while ago and service was a bit on the slow but I did not mind. 

Also, as an FYI, I too can make you their Ceviche Veracruzano ($21.95) but for that price, I could make you enough to serve at least 3 people. There is that high-margin thing again.
Is it fair?

Well, you are paying to get out of the house and to try some semi-authentic Mexican food, no? Sometimes just not having to cook and having it brought to you is worth the price of admission. But don't be too surprised when you pay $13(!?) for two flautas. Seriously??! 

Personally, when I go to restaurants, I try to not pick the ones I can easily make the same dishes at home for about half the price."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here in the summer, sitting on the patio, and ordering a few beers or margaritas, along with tortilla chips and guacamole, and just enjoying talking with friends.  I also like coming in the winter and getting a nice warm meal and sharing with friends or a date.  Hm.  Guess I like coming here a lot.   I also like that the cuisine is more authentic Mexican than Tex- Mex."}
{"text":"I liked a lot about this place.  The waitress we had was SO NICE: cheery, informative and helpful.  I had a raspberry blended margarita and it was quite good and came with a sugar rim (which is to my liking).  The food was okay - it was not amazing Mexican but it was not terrible either.  I generally enjoyed it but I wouldn't be craving it.  I have to say, their guac was the bomb.  Not a bad stop!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Mexican food in the city. The food is great and reasonably priced. The drinks are a bit on the pricey side ($6-ish). The back patio is amazing, plastic chairs Mexican decorations, a big tree, Mexican tunes and the smell of food wafting from the kitchen. Makes you feel like you're someone else just for a little while."}
{"text":"So Delicious! I highly recommend the enchiladas chorizo and the fish tacos! The tres Leches Cake is Amazin'. I will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Guacamole, a margarita on the rocks, and a cozy hidden patio. Summer perfection."}
{"text":"The food wans't terrbile but they had one server working on a Saturday afternoon.  We waited for a table, then 15 mins more to take our order, then another 30 for food.  This is a small place so they don't need a staff of 20 but a bit more attention to customer service would have made this a very different review."}
{"text":"Came here thinking it would be a quick bite. Was very wrong. It took ages to get seated. We chose to sit in the back patio, which was partially covered, but it had been drizzling and raining on and off and the partial covering was not good enough for that sort of weather.

After being seated, it took ages to order and get our food, even though we had basically already known what we were going to get by the time we were seated. Also noticed a broken bottle next to my seat, which wasn't particularly safe.

I ordered the beef enchiladas Mexicanas with the green (mild) sauce. My partner got the 5 taco platter, a mix of beef and chicken. Neither of us was overly impressed or blown away by our food. After finishing, we once again waited for ages before anyone came to us and we could ask for the bill.

In the end, instead of waiting for someone to come to us so we could pay, we just got ready and went inside and paid there. It still took some time.

All in all, won't be returning. It's not remotely close to us, and the food seemed mediocre at best. Although our server was very bubbly and sweet, the service in general was lacking. Nothing to really get us to return."}
{"text":"Proving once again that Toronto has no good Mexican restaurants. Generally bland and overpriced (20 dollar nachos!).  No complimentary chips and salsa.  Super slow service and the place wasn't even half full.  I will say that the gold plated nachos and the tortilla soup were tasty but $34 for ten small uninspiring tacos was too much.  Two people should be able to eat Mexican for way less than the $80 (before tip) we paid,  and we didn't even order alcohol!"}
{"text":"Colleague from Mexico recommended this place to me because I was lamenting the fact that Toronto Mexican food experiences had been bland up to now. This place didn't disappoint. Pleasant ambiance and friendly service along with what matters most, well prepared food and beverages. The michelada was well prepared and the nacho appetizer as well as my fajita main were generous in size and tasty. Refried beans were fresh and not just a waste of calories. I can see why my mexican compadre would like this place...recommended!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in Mexico for more than 2 years. I'm excited and scared at the same time because everything has changed. Cities, people, situations, and life in general have only something that is constant: change.

Food could appear to be easy to replicate if you follow a recipe; if you had seen how it has been cooked; if you go to school and make it a million times, or if you woke up with inspiration (a muse on your side).

Food is culture. Food is a way of transmission (salmonella, love, rage, etc.), and I completely believe that you can taste the effort, the kindness, the love, or magic the cook tried to put into that offer to your senses.

If you are lucky enough to have inherited the gift of cooking (beware you will be surrounded by ppl asking you to cook for them, like my ex grandma, mom and aunties know) then you can stay home and satisfy your own and your loved ones cravings. However, if you lack time, interest, touch, or you just get so bored of your surroundings that you just need to go and discover the other blocks, well, you would expect that the hired person has better or worth to try skills.

What happened to me in this bookmarked place was Meh.

I´m glad I just ordered a Pancita and a Margarita. The Margarita had a cool umbrella I kept, but when I tasted it pufff fake lime... Really? And the soup came in a cute talavera plate, but that was the charming part, the plate... It was lacking seasoning, with 5 pieces of pancita, 2 of which were huge and I needed to fight against in order to cut them with my spoon (splash..).

The waitress was really nice but weird, even when I asked her if she spoke Spanish using our language, every time she pass by to check on me (yes I was the only one there) she kept asking in English \"is everything ok?\". She gave me free totopos, but I needed to ask for salsa, it didn´t come by itsef... In a real Mexican place the salsa arrives first."}
{"text":"El Ricon offers a surplus of vegetarian options - which is a rarity in Mexican fare. The options are full of flavor with enough spice to quench your thirst. Enjoy a night of authentic Latin American cuisine at affordable prices on the patio - or take a seat in their welcoming dining room during the colder days of the year. Highly recommend this St. Clair West Mexican eatery. Bring friends or head here on a second or third date. Not a place to impress - but rather a place to enjoy good old homey, yummy Mexican eats. Sure, there might be a tinge of Tex-Mex in the decor, but the flavors offer up authenticity."}
{"text":"Pros: Authentic food,  good live music was on the night we came
Cons:  we had to wait for a long time to be seated in the patio ( though not too many people were even there),  and the price. Kinda expensive for the experience in my humble opinion.

We go there occasionally. sometimes it is 3 starts, sometimes it is 4."}
{"text":"Next time I feel like \"Run to the border\", I'll be running away from this place. Had the Enchilada with the \"Red Sauce\" (medium) drizzled with melted cheese and sour cream and stuffed with Chirizo sausage. These puppies must have been made 2 weeks before and stuffed into the freezer. Pop them into the microwave and serve. The \"Red Sauce\" was like powder, the melted cheese pulled away in one piece like a piece of abstract art. (Apologies to abstract artists). Not to mention if the sour cream was on there, they only showed the cream to these, and it was COLD at best. The Mango Margarita was good, but the tequila was the cheapest they could get. Did not have dessert, as I could not get out of there fast enough. My recommendation would be to hit a Taco Bell if you feel like Mexican, they at least ensure the quality of food that is served at least is hot and flavorful."}

{"text":"Small place but there's a downstairs and a back patio. The service is super friendly. The food was delicious - the guacamole was made to the perfection! We tried the chicken and carne asada tacos, as well as the fish tacos. Really tasty, well balanced and seasoned and a generous portion (4 to an order). Also the enchiladas were really good! I even got the veggie one with the mild green sauce and that sauce is amazing! The flan is definitely the way to go for dessert! It's quite dense so almost like a cheesecake consistency but super smooth and rich, caramel-eggy flavours. The churros and fried ice cream were a bit of a miss, the dough and fried bits used were a bit underwhelming, almost too dense and stale. It could have been the oil used. But take it from me, if you like flan, it's truly a great sweet way to end a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Came with my husband and two small children on a very slow Saturday lunchtime. There were three other tables, with two of the tables having been sat right before us. The service was beyond slow. They claim it's because everything is authentic and homemade but that's just a lame excuse. There was only one slllloooooowwww cook and one waitress. After 10 minutes and not having the chips and guacamole yet we had to ask for the food to be prepared to go. When I went back to ask how long it would be, that's when I saw that our ticket wasn't even up on the cook's board. It was still untouched in the register.  Once we had the food, it was decent but nothing worth the wait. Too bad cause this place is super close to us. I'd rather drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had been warned about this place but because of social pressure I ended up going and sure enough, I paid $18 for an appetizer that was awful and I didn't even order anything to drink! (just water for me).  My order of chicken wings was so tiny and dry, I ate only four and left the rest of them in my plate.  My party didn't have much luck either, all the food was dripping with oil.  

Overall, it's too bad the place has such bad unreasonably expensive food since the patio is nice and it needs better food to do it justice."}
{"text":"Came here starving craving some quality food, ordered chicken burrito and was the best decision I have made so far in the week of eat out foods. Portion was good for a 160lb HUNGRY man. They even gave me a free plate of nachos to start my meal with! Food was delicious and salsa was amazing and spicy!! I asked for extra salsa and they delieverd! 

Over all very good experience here, just expect to wait for your food as they prepare the food ON THE SPOT. But other than kitchen speed, servers are cute Spanish girls that makes me fall in love and was on point! 

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sadly didn't even get to try the food. Waiting in line when a man, seeming like a manager yelled down the line of people waiting to enter the empty restaurant, asking us rah how many in our groups. 3 parties ahead of us who had been waiting much longer than us when he told the first party they would have at least 20 more minutes waiting when they were outraged because they'd already been waiting 20 minutes with a reservation. I was really looking forward to trying this place but not sure if I'll be back. He then yelled to us all in the line. We can either wait or leave. Or choice he doesn't care.  Us and 3 parties left"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that outside of Burrito Boyz, I've never really had an \"authentic\" burrito. 

I will say that I thought the Burrito Mojado I had was quite good. The beef chunks were good and the rice was delicious. The side salad is a bit lame but I never expect much out of side salads. I also heard good things about the chorizo taco (better than beef) and side rice.

I think the biggest vote of confidence I can give is that I will be back. I want to try and tacos, nachos, and the fajitas. I think if you're looking for authentic (at least I think it's authentic) Mexican food, you can't go wrong with El Rinco."}
{"text":"Our first time here was fantastic. The atmosphere felt authentic and staff were hospitable and helpful. The food tasted fresh and authentic. We had a plate of nachos with chicken which was nice and moist. The enchiladas, tacos, and burrito were delicious! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sorry, not a fan...but remember, that's just my opinion! I always feel guilty writing bad reviews so let me balance my 2 stars by mentioning that a few of my friends are BIG fans of this place. So, there's that.

We sat on the back patio and enjoyed some tasty guacamole (nothing outstanding but still tasty; after all, how do you eff up guacamole?) and Micheladas (a Mexican drink made with beer, spices, lime and a salted rim....different but very nice).

I asked the waitress what her favourite dishes are. She said enchiladas or fajitas. I ordered chicken enchiladas and, sorry, wasn't too enthralled. In fact, I was straight-up disappointed. Flavours were just meh.

But you should still come here and try out the fajitas--they might be amazing... (There's that guilt again!)"}
{"text":"I checked out El Rincon Mexicano this past weekend by accident while attempting to get into Marcello's for pizza. Big mistake about Marcello's but also a big win for trying out something new. Ironically the best Mexican food I've ever had is in Hong Kong in the Mid-levels, but for Toronto, El Rincon is tops. The place is tiny and is easy to pass by if you are driving on St. Clair but worth seeking out. Inside, the brightly light, lively decor is set to a backdrop of Mexican music playing on the speakers. The menu has a mix of all the traditional Mexican foods you would want to eat. Sampled at the restaurant was white sangria, guacamole, a veggie burrito, pork soft shell tacos and a churros for dessert. Sangria was sweet yet refreshing, guacamole had a mild spice in the after taste which was complemented by the chipolte sauce served on the side. However, not as spicy or as thick as the guac from Dos Caminos in New York though :(. After the guac and sangria, I barely had room for the burrito but managed my way through it. I left the side salad as it did not look super appetizing but the burrito was good. My partner had the pork tacos and gave it two thumbs up. We both tasted the churros. Two came for dessert with caramel sauce and whipping cream as decor. It was warm, fried goodness on a plate! Inexpensive and a great place to share some drinks and food with friends or family. El Rincon also has a sizeable tequila list if you are interested. I would go back the next time I crave Mexican."}
{"text":"First time here, nice setting and looks authentic Mexican. Came because of an episode of \"you gotta eat here\". 

Nothing featured on that segment was on their menu. :(

Nacho chip basket was full of crumbs and course salt (bottom of the bag). 

Main course tasted great. Fish tacos, chicken empanadas and chicken quesadilla. 

Service was slow, and they weren't even busy. Had to ask for water in 35* heat. 

All in all, okay experience. Maybe regulars have better luck."}
{"text":"In my books El Rincon is a giant MEH.  Nothing stood out in a really positive or negative way, but we have no plans to return.  If we're in the area and craving Mexican, we'll go back to Tenoch or King's Tacos.

We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday.  We decided to go to El Rincon after looking up our options on Yelp because we had a craving for fish tacos to satisfy.  It was not busy at all - there was nobody in the front dining room, but we were led to the back patio where there was one other table dining.  During the course of our lunch there were a handful of tables that came in.  

Our lunch started off with the guacamole ($13) - quite expensive and not worth it.  My husband liked it but while it was fine, I thought it could have been better, especially for the price.  However I did enjoy the fact that the chips were warm (freshly made?)  Portion size was on the small side for the price.

For our main we really only wanted fish tacos, which came 4 to an order.  We would have been open to trying other tacos but they came minimum 5 to an order and we knew we could not finish 9 tacos between the two of us.  We asked if we could order 6 fish tacos but the answer was no.  We were going to just split the 4 fish tacos but our server told us that the order was on the small side and encouraged us to order more, so we added an order of the tacos dorados (crispy tacos) which we later regretted, because the 4 fish tacos turned out to be enough, and the tacos dorados weren't very good.

The fish tacos were only ok.  The battered fish appeared pretty dark - they weren't burnt, but definitely over-fried and there was too much batter.  We ate them because we were pretty hungry but can't say it satisfied our craving for a really good fish taco.  Other reviewers noted that they thought the fish tacos seemed on the small side (which I read beforehand and pushed me to order the tacos dorados when the server said our order was small) but we thought they were pretty consistent with most other tacos joints.

The chicken tacos dorados didn't look over-fried, but were still on the dry side, and it was only filled in the middle part of the roll, so a good part of the taco was just like a nacho chip.  Did not seem like good value.

As an aside, and this is totally not the fault of the restaurant, but near the end of our meal we were being pestered by several wasps flying around us and our food which really didn't help the dining experience."}
{"text":"Good food, though you shouldn't have any expectations of a quick meal here -- the food takes a long time to get to the table and it can really go down to a crawl when the resto is dimly busy.
Pircewise, it ain't cheap, but doesn't break the bank. Portion sizes are perfect and the place is child friendly."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The service is a little slow, but friendly and very helpful.

They have delicious Mexican, with three levels of spicy. I like their quesadillas, giant shrimp burrito, guacamole. 

The restaurant inside is about 5-6 tables only, with a beautiful patio that has about double the seating. 

Not too pricey, either."}
{"text":"Staff were very accommodating to our large group. The fish tacos were delish and quite filling. I had the beergarita, it was really good. 
My waitress was Camilla, she was super cute with a pretty smile. :)"}
{"text":"I've been hear a few times and I have never been disappointed. Large and filling portions and extremely flavourful food paired with attentive staff that have no issue giving you their full attention and offering their opinions on dishes. A small and colourful space with extra seating in the basement -- feels very homey and comfortable. From giant margaritas to cactus appetizers I try to push myself to try something new each time and have yet to be disappointed. The thing that sets this place apart for me was when I visited with my sister and she was unfortunately let down by the camaron burrito (shrimp), they profusely apologized and took the item off the bill AND the next time we visited the manager ensured that he would make sure it was cooked thoroughly and continually checked up on us throughout our stay. Great food, warm atmosphere and friendly and attentive staff, an easy five stars from my family and I and I cant wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"The service was horrendous and the tacos were very disappointing. In a city like Toronto with man taco options, this place should be avoided at all cost"}
{"text":"Last Saturday we went to El Rincon after we watch \"You gotta eat here\" TV show featuring this mexican restaurant in St Clair. 
We arrived un the afternoon and the place was full. The manager told us that they were fully booked  and that we should wait 30 minutes if we want a table in the patio section so we decided to wait outside. Once we get our table the waitress say to us that the restaurant was working at their maximum capacity and that the kitchen were serving the food with some delays. I saw some reviews complaining about the waiting time but you have to understand that this is no Taco Bell and that they cook every dish at the moment. We were a party of 3 and we order the fish tacos, chorizo empanadas and a Parrillada. The food was amazing. I know about mexican food and let me tell you that this restaurant is like eat at any good restaurant in Mexico. Everything tasted like it supposed to taste if you were in Mexico. Also they have a beautiful patio with lots of folklore and latin music so for a moment you dont even feel like you are in Toronto. 
Kudos for El Rincon. We will be back soon but this time we will make a reservation to avoid all the waiting."}
{"text":"Awesome patio, great food, friendly service! The Friday night music was great & very authentic & relaxing. A definite plus was that the decor made us feel like we were on vacation.. in Mexico, which is more than one can say for many Mexican restaurants in TO!  We were very happy with our food (good portions, well cooked)."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to El Rincon and the first time we didn't eat on the patio. If it's not open and you're with a larger group (we were a group of 5), don't bother. The indoor atmosphere is awful; fluorescent lightening that feels like you're in a hospital and the tables are so crammed together that we had to turn the table at an angle to all fit. Our table was also by the window so there were cold drafts and the neon open sign got knocked down when we tried to put on our winter coats to leave. 

The waitress was fine but like others have said, it took forever to get our food. Considering everything is made from scratch, it's something you just have to be prepared for. We had made reservations but when we got there they were surprised and hustled to throw a table together and like I said, we were really crammed in. 

On a positive note, the food seemed fresh and well prepared but everyone at our table felt it was too expensive for the amount of food we received. Granted there were only a handful of tables available in the tiny space so to remain open all winter and survive without the additional income that the patio provides in the summer, I guess the owners have to charge more. 

If you like a lot of lettuce or cheese on your fajitas versus meat, be forewarned. My husband asked for more lettuce and cheese (it comes with a tiny plate) for his fajitas and the waitress didn't mention that is an extra $4. Since we weren't informed, we assumed it was complimentary. We would have appreciated the heads up. 

Overall, the meals were decent but wait until summer so you can enjoy their good food on a beautiful patio. It makes a huge difference in the dining experience."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with a few friends on a recommendation. They had Los Tacos, Enchiladas and I had the Enfrijoladas. I think the star of them was the tacos - you could order different proteins in one order. They were fresh, plentiful, various and delicious. Honestly, maybe my pallet isn't sophisticated enough but between the enchiladas and the enfrijoladas, I couldn't tell much difference outside of spice level. They were good, though! 

The most disappointing thing about our visit was they were out of guacamole, which a lot of reviews said to try. It was 8pm we went, an hour and a half before they closed. Maybe they'd just run out? Disappointing regardless. 

Friendly service, good food. If you try the guac, let me know how it is!"}
{"text":"El Rincon Mexicano Restaurant is as authentic as it gets in Toronto, but there are a few things you need to know before going.

The food is good, but way overpriced. The service is pretty slow: waited forever to get a refill, and trust me, when your food is that spicy, you don't want to be waiting to get a refill! I felt that my mouth was going to explode, and my waitress was nowhere to be seen! When she finally appeared, I told her I needed a refill. Another 10-15 passed and no refill, and at that point, I had stopped eating my food. When she came by again to ask how we were, I asked about my refill, and she said she had forgotten. By that point, my food was cold, and I didn't want to have to pay for another drink, so I told her to forget it. Service like this is unacceptable.

The atmosphere is lively, but it feels too cramped inside. The chairs are not very comfortable, either. I would avoid going during the winter because the patio out back seems to be the biggest draw. I didn't eat outside, so I can't comment on it.

I've gone to many Mexican restaurants over the years, and El Rincon Mexicano is nothing special. If I hadn't received such awful service, I would probably give it another chance just because I love Mexican food. If you are craving Mexican, then by all means, go to El Rincon Mexicano. Just make sure you save your drink, because you never know when your waitress is going to disappear."}
{"text":"I got the burrito mojado with chorizo and it was delish!! The guac, however, was a bit bland. They have cheap drinks which i really liked- try the micheladas! 
The only thing that i didn't like was that when we got there we asked to be seated on the patio- there were about 10 tables (all empty) and the waitress said if we sat at the table that we picked, we would be asked to move if other ppl came. What? The place was empty!! And for the smokers- you cant smoke in the patio which meant we had to go to the front. Other than that, i would return to el rincon!"}
{"text":"I went there for valentines and all I can say is that I had a great evening. They had some live music and the food was amazing. We  had the traditional guacamole for a starter, then we decided to try their new special that was made out of beef, green and red peppers and melted cheese on top (not quite sure of the name) it was mouthwatering  and great taste. The staff are very courteous and friendly. We will definately  come back  to try more of your menu items. Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and always fantastic.

My husband and I went on our second date, and we now go back for valentines day each year.

Expensive, but worth it. Be patient, it is slow... but delicious takes time.

Make a reservation... it gets busy!

tip: Rice is not vegetarian, get extra beans instead of rice."}
