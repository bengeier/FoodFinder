{"text":"Meh. 6 skinny mozzarella sticks for $7. It's an appetizer for and 1 adult and 1 toddler. Wish we just went to Costco to get a whole bag, but my teens were h-anger-y ;)   Wednesday wings, glad they still have it. Stick with the original. I wouldn't recommend their wing sauce; their garlic parm is nothing compared to Long Wongs or Buffalo Wild Wings.  Fries were bland. The staff...they seemed \"nice\" but...off... 2-3x our server and this dude walked by said \"how's everything going/tasting\" and they kept walking without stopping or even really lookong at our table because each time that happened, one person in our party had an empty drink. They were just going through the smiles and verbal motions without actually...serving.  Would I go back to Hooters? Yes. This one? Neeeevvvaaahhhhhhh, go DOWNTOWN, not here."}
{"text":"You will be hard pressed to find a better burger.  The menu has changed recently, I recommend over other similar sports bars.  ThIs location and the rock hill location really care that you get good food and service. You will get a hand pressed half pound burger here, not a frozen thin excuse for a burger that other places give you.  If you don't like what you get tell them, they will make it good, just be nice and honest with them.  They do listen to the customers!  I am not alone there are many regulars I see each time I visit."}
{"text":"I really liked this hooters. i am visiting, and the hooters from my town isn't that great. Hot girls and decent priced beer. I plan to go back before I leave."}
{"text":"We had a cockroach moonwalk across our table as we were licking our fingers eating. Super duper gross and to say we snapped is an understatement! The waitress got a Manager and he said there are no roaches there and he walked away without a care in the world. We settled our bill, left and we will never go back, ever, ever again. Actually it's the Manager we detest more than the moonwalking cockroach."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the all you can eat wings on Wednesday. Our waitress was really nice and gave us awesome customer service. Our drinks and food came out really fast and it was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"It's been a while (almost a year) since I have been here and the remodeling job is fantastic. It's clean, it's sleek and it's amazing...and I'm jealous of the TVs.   The food is hooter fare, so if you like it this place is for you. Personally, I am a huge fan of hooters wings; they just hit the spot. If you don't, well the beer selection is now quite extensive; and after a few beers does food quality really matter? Let's be honest ... at that point you are just trying to slow down the drunk.   All in all, it was a much needed cosmetic update to a great part of downtown. It's a hooters so the waitresses are friendly, the food is good, beer is ice cold and it's worth the time. If you just went to a Dbacks game, you are less than a 10 min walk. Check it out."}
{"text":"I stopped in the new Hooters at the Palms yesterday and it was terrific. My server, Adrienne was very friendly and approachable. The food was well prepared. At this time, the only area open is a small seating area and the patio overlooking the Palms pool. When the rest of it is open, it will be the largest Hooters in the world. I think it will be an amazing place when it's completed based on the laid back, hanging at the beach atmosphere they've been able to generate so far. Great place ! Not the same old Hooters. Check it out !"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot .... Love the steamed shrimp !!  Service was amazing as well...and in and out"}
{"text":"I always wanted to eat at Hooters, I wish my first time would have been a better experience!! The food and drinks were excellent, but the service was horrible. Our server was \"Jefanie\" and she could work on her customer service skills. She was a bit inattentative and every time we asked her questions, she either didn't hear us or looked at us like we were crazy. I was there with my boyfriend and his best friend. I think she thought they were flirting with her every time they spoke to her, it was obvious to me. And the funny part was they didn't even think she was hot. I'm in the hospitality industry and understand that people not only go places for the product, but for the experience too, she made mine not so great for a first-timer and she got a $22 tip out of it anyway because we're nice like that. Next time we'll go to a different Hooters."}

{"text":"This Hooters is amazing, biggest Hooters i have ever seen, food was brought to us fast and we are a party of 7. Seated promptly and drinks came just as fast. Our food is amazing as our server Amberlyn is just as amazing!!! We wil be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service today and very good food! I like the way this Hooters does the sauce on the wings.  Some locations my wings are damn near dry, but this one always has tender chicken and a good amount of sauce.   Waitresses were prompt and attentive.  It's not 5 star cuisine but it's good chicken, beer and pretty girls, so I'm happy!  I've been here many times and normal come in every time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Went for AYCE wings and I wasn't disappointed, the Daytona wings were great and ended up having 4 plates of wings, the atmosphere was great and our waitress was very friendly, I always know what to get when I go here, would recommend it to anyone who are just looking for a quick bite to eat, the wings are not the biggest but the sauces are pretty good."}
{"text":"Everyone knows hooters. I love their wings. I really do. They might be the most delicious wings in the world for me.  The pretty sights don't hurt either.   However, this location is really bad. Their draft beer is always flat, always, so just get a bottle and save your self the pain.   It always smells like a bathroom. I think their ventilation system is very bad. Most of the time I choose to be seated outside or as far away for the restroom just because of how much I love the food. Sometimes I just turn away.  However, the other day, this location hit a new low when I ordered a bottle of beer, and when I got served the beer, the person serving me was holding a mop in one hand and beer on the hand and served me, asking if need anything else. Upon me saying no, went on mopping the floor. Disgusting.  I can't go to this place anymore. period. I will find a new location."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers  stay away from hooters downtown, the service is poor and the food is worse. They treat u very poorly and when u ask management if they can resolve an issue they belittle u and tell u to leave. Never will I go to hooters again, will let family and friends know about the terrible experience I received."}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more from this location. As soon as you walk in there is a small sign that states \"seat yourself\", after reading it the bartender shouted that we needed to seat ourselves. Not once upon entering were we greeted by any employee. I believe a manager took our drink order and I asked him about the mango lemonade, he told me because it was flavored I would not be allowed any refills so I just stuck with the regular lemonade but as i told him that he replied with \"ohhhh come on\". I believe smart remarks are not necessary.  Since today is veterans day all Vets get a free meal upon showing a military ID, my boyfriend showed his and for whatever reason the manager taking our drinks did not believe his military ID was real? He then rudely asked for a drivers license because he needed to be sure that he didn't barrow the military ID from a \"buddy\". The picture on the military ID clearly verifies that it is him. I found that very disrespectful. Although he was doing his job he could have asked in a different manner. There has never been an instance where he has been asked for both IDs to verify that he is in fact in the military.  The waitress that took our wing order was nice but seemed very confused with what she was doing. The wings came out within ten minutes and they tasted okay, however I did not enjoy the cajun wings. As I said before i was expecting so much more from this location. I'll just stick to BWW or Wing stop."}
{"text":"Perhaps the slowest service I've ever experienced.  Manager came over to tell me they forgot to drop the boneless wings.   Like that matters to me.  It was all you can eat night, have enough people on staff to handle it!  Wings came out burned.   Knife had rust on it.  Bad experience!!  They offered a 6% discount which hardly numbed the pain from the poor experience.  When I first sat at the bar, the bartender was too busy flirting with a guy at the bar to even notice me.  I waited a good 10 minutes for a beer.  Poor poor service!"}
{"text":"So I'm a loyal Hooters customer !! I've been to 100's across the country over the last 23 yrs and I'm sad to say this hooters takes the crown as the worse hooters in the United States ! Entering the restaurant we did not receive the ever so annoying \"WELCOME TO HOOTERS\" shout from all the girls !! So my friend and I made our way over to the bar area , I picked the seats closest to the well station cause there was literally 4 waitresses 1 bartender and 1 manager in that area so I figured I would get great service !! Sat there for 5 minutes literally an arm length away from these 6 employees and not one of them greeted us or took a drink order ! They all just sat there shooting the shit ! My friend and I decided to leave these seats since we weren't being served anyways and we walked 15 feet into the gaming area hoping service mite be better on this side ! We were quickly greeted and served drinks ! As I sat there I looked around this place and I reminisced of all the locations I've visited over the yrs , my wings came out quickly 10 breaded seasoned HOT , they were large wings but literally tasted like they were marinated in Tabasco sauce !!! Disgusting ! I drank my bees and watched the employees interactions and I was absolutely shocked !! This place is obviously a locals hangout !! The conversations between the employees and customers highly inappropriate !! The female employees and male employees poor boundaries !! I've got to say the place wasn't busy but they had lots of girls working !!! Well I take that back , they were hanging out more than working !! Advice to management I do believe it's against health code for an employee in uniform to be eating wings or any food behind the bar and then take an order !! Jesus she didn't even was her hands after licking the wing sauce from her fingers !!!! And this is the first time I've ever seen a bartender take a shot of liquor behind the bar while working !!! And now I have no clue what the law is on this but I'm just gonna take a wild guess that even if it's not a law it's probably against some policy for the bartender to take a food and beverage order and while waiting to go around the other side of the bar and put money in the gaming machine and gamble !!!!! And WIN !!! Running back around the bar to the cash register and cash out her $20 ticket !!! I was shocked when I saw the employees actions but then it all made sense when I saw the managers who looked like they were in their early 20's playing grab ass with the girls !!!! I made a promise to myself never to come back to this hooters , so unprofessional ,no hooter spirit , the whole time there never once heard welcome to hooters !!!! Place sucks it's dirty , bartenders drinking and gambling , waitresses sitting around eating wings behind the bar licking finger!!! Please go to a break room so nasty ! And managers who look like high school kids playing grab ass with the girls !!!!! This place is an unprofessional messy epic fail !!! HIGHLY ENCOURAGE COOPERATE TO STEP IN ASAP"}
{"text":"Ohhhh hooters what happend to you??You use to make me smile with your awesome food and beautiful women.But are times really that tough that you must use the c squad now and make ok food??I came here last week as it has been at least a year since ive been,and was not impressed.First thing, when I arrived the place was dead but was told I would be seated by a hostess, after five or so minutes we were seated.And at a dirty table no less when I asked our waitress if she could wipe our table she simply rolled her eyes and said sure.Placed orders(wings and beers) and after what seemed like forever we got said order but wrong flavors so we smiled and just ate them anyway.The waitress seemed to forget about us as she stood out on patio with a couple of gentlemen and had a conversation.After that she came back in and walked right by our table with empty beers and finished food.That was my que I got our tab and WOW for two people you would have thought we had a party.So after this Hooters has left a sour taste in my mouth and I may not return which is a sad thing to say."}
{"text":"So I placed my order and asked if I could sit at the bar and the hostess said yes, anyhow after waiting an hour with servers passing us by I decided to walk up to someone and asked about the whereabouts of our order and was told I had to place the order once more if I wanted to sit at the bar and pretty much was told that it was my fault that I'm suppose to know that the order was never placed because of where I was seated. I was ignored much of my visit I don't recommend hooters on rainbow save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"What can I say that's good, the manager refunded our money promptly I guess. I ordered 40 hot wings breaded to go, we live in Queen Creek so just picking them up was a hassle. Our order was fumbled so badly that we had to finish making them at home."}
{"text":"Negative one star do not spend your money there poor management and they are super rude."}
{"text":"Great Hooters location, especially for lunch because they are fast!"}
{"text":"What can I say, great wings, great big fish sandwich, and great buffalo shrimp.  The waitresses are very attentive to both myself and my husband.  We go there a couple of times a month and only once have we had a waitress that was not all there."}
{"text":"Service was fast, girls were friendly, and a little talkative, but in a good balance. Food was actually pretty good.  Honestly, it's a Hooters... You know what you're getting. But this is a good Hooters location. Will be back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and this location holds some sentimental memories for me.  My most recent visit will be my last.  Very disappointing.  The service was terrible, we had to ask a waitress to clear the table so we could sit and the place wasn't busy either.  They were all just standing around chatting.  The calamari tasted like rubber and we sent it back.   We also had chicken tenders which were undercooked - also sent them back and wings.  The wings were good - that was the only thing that was decent.  Then had to argue with the manager who still wanted to charge for the calamari and the chicken tenders even though we didn't eat any of it and sent it all back because we were disgusted with the food.   The server was friendly but she was slow and clearly didn't look at any of the food before bringing it out.  For these reasons they get one star."}
{"text":"after waiting 40 minutes on our order we gave up and went to Chick-fil-A across the street. Don't waste your time or money on this place.."}
{"text":"They seriously need to fire the hiring manager in this location.   All anorexic looking girls.  Worse hooters in the valley."}
{"text":"Went and got the all you could wings, they were awful. I'm pretty sure I got a batch of wings that had been sitting in the kitchen for an hour.  I rate it four stars because my waitress was fabulous. So attentive and friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled.  I would go back, just not for the wings!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab wings on a Tuesday. They have a 10 wing or 20 wing bogo spiecal on Tuesday buy 10 or 20 wings get 10 or 20 wings free."}
{"text":"Only reason to come would be for the games, boobs, and beer. The food is bleeeehhhh"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken dip was really tasty and there was enough to share between two people. Boneless wings were fresh and really saucy. The food is awesome. Our waitress was attentive. The food came out quick, we never had to ask for refills, and she even warned me that the medium sauce isn't spicy so I got hot, which was perfect. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would have given three to four stars based on my previous experiences.  Food has always been good for what it is, and service has been good as well.  Unfortunately the last two times I have gone have left a major sour taste in my mouth.  About a week ago when I arrived I waited almost 10 mins with no hostess in sight.  Employees saw me standing there, but didn't even say a word to me.  Finally I went up to one and asked if there was a hostess around, and she said to go ahead and take a seat.  After that irritation the rest of the dinner went fine.  Tonight I just went in and immediately noticed all the seats in the dining area were up on the tables.  It wasn't even 930, and they close at 11.  Like last time I stood there for several minutes with no one to greet me.  Again, employees saw me, but ignored me.  Finally I went up to the bartender and asked if they were closed.  She said the dining area is closed, but they were serving food in the bar area.  So I asked if I could just take a seat at one of the high tops in the bar area(those seats were not on the tables), and she told me they were only serving at the bar.  Since I prefer to actually have a table to eat at I left.  I just don't understand how you close the dining area an hour and a half before you close, and really don't get how this is the second time I have been totally ignored while waiting at the entrance."}
{"text":"I'm done with Hooters.  After having a terrible experience at the one on Flamingos last time I attempted to eat there,  I didn't get a chance to eat at this one either.  Just called there to place a to go order.  Someone picked up made a bunch of loud noises in the background and then hung up on me.  I called back.  The person picked up screamed \"hello\" in a Halloween type way into the phone, laughed, and hung up on me again.  Not worth my trouble to try and dine at a place with employees that don't care at all about their place of work."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this particular location. Every time I've been here the food isn't as good and I've spent way more money than the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Missy was cool but Jesse the Manager was a complete dick. He changed the UFC fight in the middle of us watching it. No customer service skills!!"}
{"text":"Hooter downtown  Phoenix...yes highly over rated...wings over cooked..overspiced....and very over priced....I had never been in Hooter anywhere before....I will never be in hooter again...sad to say all they have to sell is football and girls...."}
{"text":"Hooters degrades us. Their use of big breasts is gross. I go for the wings."}
{"text":"We had horrible service and received minimal attention at a time when the restaurant was empty. The manager had a careless attitude and didn't even apologize about the situation. He also walked away and left our table stacked with dirty dishes. Couldn't have had much worse service."}
{"text":"I thought I'd leave a review here since we just stopped by for lunch (free entrée for veteran's day). Our server was very VERY nice and attentive (Emilie?) And we never had to track someone down for anything. We were sat by the kitchen and I watched the girls working very hard the whole time. The reason for 3 stars only is the food. Hubby did not like his wings as he likes them and asked for them to be extra crispy. He said he should have ordered them naked. I had the shrimp which was oddly lacking in flavor, since it was supposed to be tossed in buffalo sauce. Fries were very fresh and I also did notice many additions to their menu since we have been here last. Restaurant was clean but for some reason it smelled like rotten eggs when we first came in. Maybe some gas from the kitchen? It dissipated after a few minutes. I'd come here to watch games or hang with friends but don't come looking for 5 star food lol. I appreciate the hard working servers and did not see any slacking off, as other reviewers mentioned. Our server even mentioned she was working a double shift today and was still very energetic, attentive and friendly. I'd come back, and ask for her again. Thank you for supporting veterans :)"}
{"text":"Place sucked dick. Wings didnt have sauce. And these force of will players wouldn't split."}
{"text":"Wait staff was friendly only thing positive about the place.  Walked in the floor was sticky.  Went to open the menu and the menu pages were stuck together.   I ordered oysters on the half she'll and they came out warm.  We left after that was not interested in finding out what the rest of the food was going to be like.  WARM OYSTERS!!! Make some one deathly ill!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, waitress forgot about us during pickup order, overpriced at $10 for ten wings. Plus you have to walk through with the entire length of the palms to even get there."}
{"text":"10/16/2017 Yelp Review  Hooters  455 N 3rd St #190 Phoenix, AZ 85004   I have always been a huge fan of Hooters wings, their drinks, and of course their fun exciting atmosphere. After a long day at work, my boyfriend and I went to grab our favorite wings, sliders, and refreshments. It was about 9 at night, the game just went off, so the restaurant was starting to calm down. So as my boyfriend and I walk into Hooters, we had to wait for about 10 minutes just to be seated, several employees pranced passed us, while not one even said a word to us. So eventually I just said ,let's seat ourselves.  Now I am a firm believer that if a place of business does not greet you within the first 90 seconds then your business is unwanted.But since I had a long day at work, I was not in the mood to deal with the downtown traffic or find a new place to eat. So as soon as we seated ourselves , a girl came rushing out saying \"you usually have to wait and be seated by someone, your not suppose to seat yourself\" in a very negative tone. Then she walked away, and turned back and said \"I guess I'll find someone to service you\". 20 minutes went by, and no one has bothered to serve us. No water, a hello, or how are you doing this evening. My boyfriend became angry and whistled to the waiter at the table behind us outside on the patio, and asked for two glasses of water with lemon.  She came back and brought two cups of water, without lemon. I asked the waiter for lemon and she never came back. Another 10 minutes went by , so we have been sitting outside for about 30 minutes without being served or greeted properly.  A girl finally came, and asked us for our drink order, then we both replied we just want food. As we ordered our food, the waiter was very rude, and was constantly rolling her eyes. After she went to put the order in, she came back in 4 minutes and handed my boyfriend and I our bill. Before even receiving our food. We instantly felt we were getting racially profiled, and treated unfairly because we looked young.So I instantly asked to speak with the manger. While waiting I got up, and asked every table surrounding us , did your waiter make you pre pay before receiving your meal? Every table responded with a no, and became frustrated because they saw how bad we were getting treated. So the manager walks out and I asked him, so is this your protocol for having customers pre pay before receiving their meal, because everyone around us did not have to prepay for their meals. He replied\" this is a new policy in place, please forgive me and my team because this is fairly new\". I said well sir, where is this written down at since this is your new policy? He responded it was just put in place last week, so the marketing material has not been sent in. I said well sir, then how is a rule going to be put in place if you have no formal documentation. He responded saying, well once it gets here I could email it. I instantly became angry because although this may be a \"policy\" then you should make sure you and your team should follow through, and treat every customer equal. He said I apologize could I get you something to drink, on the house.   I am not sure why he asked because we already paid for our food and drinks, so what could you offer us in exchange for the poor service.  So our food came out and we took it to go. Once we got home, there was no dressing for the wings, we ordered all flats and got a mixture of all types of wings, our sliders did not have the proper toppings, and we were given fries instead of a salad as the side.  Our experience, was definitely horrible, I would not recommend going to the Hooters on 455 N 3rd St #190, Phoenix, AZ 85004. The service is horrible, the employees are rude, and the manager has horrible customer service skills. They are in desperate need of a customer service training.  DO NOT GO THERE. TAKE YOUR SERVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE. I spent way too much money on food that was worth $5 or less. I would give them 1 star out of 5, just because the lemonade was very refreshing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Nothing like dumb little imature girls with tights on serving boose. Boy do I mean dumb. Heck of a business. The service here sucks but would I except anything more. I think not. The funniest thing is the drunk at the bar talking about shooting guns in a restaurant. Lets party."}
{"text":"Had a little bit of wait for menus and drinks, but staff is very nice and were apologetic. Theres a block of ice in my Jameson & Coke and was a bit watered down."}
{"text":"Never been to a Hooters, let alone on a HOLIDAY Monday, when you're not prepared STAFF or FOOD wise?!? Could be one of the biggest nights of the year with the foot traffic. And the place is 1/2 full. Still can't serve food? Wow."}
{"text":"11/15/11 We love chicken wings and Hooters atmosphere, but have been pretty disappointed since the Spring Valley location opened. Service was terrible and wings just okay.  BUT ALL THAT HAS CHANGED! Not sure if they have new management in, but the service has really stepped up, the wings are always hot and arrive quickly, and the waitresses are not just pretty faces anymore....they actually know how to serve and provide a smiling face to customers.  Go see Holly! She just relocated from the Hooters Casino and was fun, sassy, spunky, quick with our drinks and our food and a pleasure to be around.   Wanna try something new? Order wings tossed in 911 first, then coated in lemon pepper. Yummy. Best ordered naked to get all the flavor out of it. Sooooo goood."}
{"text":"By far the cleanest and nicest Hooters in Arizona. It's never really busy and it's pretty spacious compared to other hooters in the valley. If you are in the area you should definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service!!! I called in a To-Go order and was told 15-20min. It's been over 30min and I'm still waiting on 20 wings!!!! I will never come here again!!!! Not even worth the one star I gave them!"}
{"text":"Only came here one time.  It was halloween. The waitresses were WOW. The wings were greasy and delicious as usual.  Hooters is always one of my favorite's!"}
{"text":"I spent most of my visit being harrassed by the hostess Savannah. She spent 20min sitting at our table rudely trying to force us to buy a calendar claiming that in doing so we're supporting the troops. She made up a lie about her brother in Afghanistan needing the support. They actually send the troops calendars not donations. Why would I want to send them a calendar? Why would that help her brother? I'll go to Old Chicago next time."}
{"text":"What a great spot for bar food, more so for guys though.  I don't think I need to explain why.  The buffalo popcorn shrimp is unbelievably good.  The only problem with the shrimp is the portion size.  You want to keep ordering them, no matter how many you eat it's just not enough."}
{"text":"Horrible place.  Fake cheese sauce on the nachos and the washrooms are filthy.  This is a total dive."}
{"text":"Super friendly people working there.  I must have heard 10 hellos when I came in.  Lots of tvs to watch games, good food, and great service.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and and is usually pretty good. Today took twenty mins before a server even asked if we had been helped. If we were paying attention we would have left."}
{"text":"great wings and some hot waitresses not bad at all the only issue is they need to fix their air conditioning"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Hooters and this one didn't change my mind.  Even my friend who is a huge Hooters fan, refuses to go back after this experience.  It wasn't the service, the wings/food just weren't good.   And I kinda have to agree with Blairs husband about the ladies, sorry... This is not the hooters to go to."}
{"text":"Is what it is, great place to watch games but service was sub par. Wings are always great and the girls are nice just not impressed"}
{"text":"Sat in the bar and ordered a quesedila. 40 mins later asked if my order was still coming, the response was yes. So at that point I just ordered it to go. Upon arriving back at my room and eating, realized the chicken was burnt and quesedila was below par. My recommendation is not to eat here."}
{"text":"1st time at hooters and had the best experience tried some Finger licking wings that really hit the spot & also had a couple of green  adioses  really good drinks!  the waitress Shannon was also very friendly that took care of us  she has an amazing personality. Will  definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Food was alright. I got the twisted Texas and the meat had no seasoning at all. Service can be good or bad depending on who you get as your waitress.  Their drinks takes forever to get to the table. I had the UV blue raspberry hooterade: taste exactly like a Gatorade. The pink passion is a good drink but it is not strong enough."}
{"text":"This place is hot, over crowded and if you're really lucky, some hammered idiot at the table next to you will vomit on his food and his drunk ass buddy will still eat the food he threw up on. If you see the yellow caution tripod at a table near you....yep another drunk tossed his chicken....that means their hazmat crew has just cleaned up a barfectomy.  They even used a bleach bottle to spray this area down after they kicked vomit boy out.  Can you imagine the aroma of the combo of wings and clorox? The service was slow.  The waitress got the drink order wrong.  But she did thank us for not vomiting and being good \"sports\" after watching the guy next to us hurl.  I say, do not go here. Find another place nearby...I'm sure the Champion's in the Marriott right across the street will have better food and a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Possibly the worse service ever. I love their wings but for this simple experience, I will never go to Hooters again. Went there for the zombie walk and ordered wings and food.  My party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating."}
{"text":"Actually went here twice this week and both visits were exceptional!  This place is a well oiled machine and unfortunately I didn't get the managers name but she's definitely got this place kicking butt.  Had Harley as my waitress/bartender for both visits and she's an absolute baby-doll and 1st class associate.  Thank you Harley!  Also shout out to Paige, on my first visit, for her teamwork with Harley and making my first visit kick a$$!  Food is awesome and service is spectacular!  Keep up the excellent work and atmosphere!  Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Was passing thru south Charlotte around lunchtime today and decided to check out this Hooters.  I was disappointed at my experience....I frequent Hooters during my travels and this place is very depressing and boring.  So what did I not enjoy:  1.  I ordered 3 Mile Island sauce on my buffalo chicken sandwich and it came out tossed in hot sauce.  Luckily the 2 sauces are different colors so I noticed.  Asked the waitress, she asked the kitchen...confirmed not 3 Mile, so she promptly had the kitchen correct this.  Fries were old/cold.....at least beer was cold.  2.  Terrible smell near bar area.  Since it's a very, very, very short distance to the rest rooms....I would say this is where the stench was coming from...BUT...when I visited the \"Most\" Men's rest room, there was no bad odors.......  3.  I usually enjoy some conversation but my waitress was very business like (professional).....no small talk.  But that was the case with every girl and every table.....the Hooters Girls were all huddled up near kitchen......smoking N' joking......and customers had very little to enjoy as far as conversation.  But I will say, the sandwich was hot, the sauce (after corrected) tasted good but that was all.  So I guess that's what matters.  I've tried South Charlotte....next time I'll make sure I drive on by."}
{"text":"If I could give this service negative stars I would. By far, it was the worst service that I ever experienced. The food was cold, the server never acknowledged us, she messed up the order, and it took our waitress (Kaylyn) forever to get anything for us if we asked.  The funny part: she was only working about 5 tables. The manager was in-house, but never realized what was going on. All table's around us had the same issues. Luckily my dad thinks he always has to tip well and gave her a decent tip. If it was me she would have gotten zero dollars.  Also I've never seen my mom complain about service and today was a first. One of the worst food industry experiences my family and I have ever had. Thanks hooters! Never again. Honestly, the front and back of the house need to be let go and this location needs a fresh start with proper training."}
{"text":"Where do you go when Buffalo Wild Wings closes down, I don't know. Therefore, I thought I would try Hooters. Ewww, the food was awful; it taste like WingStop. If you're not familiar with that place it's gross and so is this Hooters. The food was nasty hardly any sauce on the wings. Come on, who picks up a buffalo wing and does not need to lick or wipe their fingers after eating it???   I tried to use the online ordering system, but it was down. I just don't care to deal with HUMANS.. too many mistakes when dealing with another person. Of course the chick(en) head got my order wrong...  Anyways, if u want your food ordered wrong and very limited sauce on your wings go this place.  2 stars because, I have to admit the bar was shinny and they did have a variety of entertainment on the televisions."}
{"text":"This could kill me. I ordered mild and they were disgraceful so we exchanged them for mild. Inedible.  The surgeon general knows nothing about the grease on this garbage."}
{"text":"It's so tacky and nothing has changed ever. The fried pickles are the best in my opinion. That's the only reason we went there. If I'm craving deep fried pickles I would for sure go out of my way to come here. The atmosphere is kind of creepy though. We walked in and it was pretty quiet with about half a dozen tables full of men awkwardly checking out the servers like they were strippers. The air conditioner hardly works either. It was so hot in there the bar tender said it turns off sometimes, it just doesn't work properly anymore. None of the washroom stalls had doors that locked. I checked all of them. The lighting was bright so I do know it wasn't too dirty. The place is so old it felt like it had some serious deep dirt that no amount of cleaning will ever get rid of.   Go for the pickles if your a fried pickle fan otherwise avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Standard hooters, if you plan on watching a game or event get there way early.  Check that, this hooters is no longer here."}
{"text":"The restaurant had 6 tables of 3-4 seated (easily less than a third occupied), yet our party of 2 still waited 40 minutes for 30 wings.   The wings were barely sauced - Hooters wings have always been wet with sauce. These things were nothing like the Hooters wings we've ever had - including at the original Hooters in Florida. Also, the blue cheese dressing had the consistency of milk.   On the plus side, our server was friendly and the beer was cold.   Probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Hooters, baby! Wings, Beers and ton's of other goodness that you'd expect from Hooters. There are plenty of TV's, Touch Tunes and plenty of sporting events and UFC/PPV's to watch.  The waitresses are always nice, hospitable and friendly and you can never go wrong with 10 medium wings with a big Coors Light."}
{"text":"If there was a 1/2 of star that's what I'd choose. Over priced and nasty will never be there again."}
{"text":"A few of us local regular co-workers tried to eat at Hooters for lunch.  We were told NO separate checks due to a convention.  We said we would leave if they couldn't separate the checks and asked our server to verify with manager.   Management would rather lose a sale then separate the checks and did not care that we left!     BAD MANAGEMENT!!!"}
{"text":"Like you obviously already know, the wings are amazing. But this specific location has exceptional wait staff and bartenders,   Highly recommended and great night out,"}
{"text":"I know, Hooters is Hooters. But this place had a strong funky smell like carpet cleaner or something.  I stuck it out and the wings were fine, beer was cold and the bartender was pleasant and did a good job. That's about it."}
{"text":"Waitresses were great! Better wings than I've had at other hooters. Waitress came around offering a free margarita to critique the bartender. Best hooters ever!"}
{"text":"Terrible service brown celery tasteless wings nonexistent waitress wish I could give minus stars"}
{"text":"Nice that you can get wings 24 hours of the day. I tried the daytona beach wings. Pretty good. Lunch here on a weekday... Not packed in here which is how i like it. The girls are cute and they smile. Though i think service could be a tad faster if i can take the time to make a review while im waitin for my ticket to get picked up"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic - we had our favorite wings and a generous chicken caesar salad.  However, the service was very poor at this location for our visit on Friday 10/04.  The waitress was rude, delayed placing our order, and did not check on our table during the meal.  Most of all, it was very disappointing when we had to return 2 minutes after we left because a member of our party left his wallet at the table.  The table was not bussed yet when we returned but the check was picked up.  Since the wallet was not where he left it, we asked the waitress who claimed she did not notice a wallet.  As soon as we asked to see the manager, she returned with the wallet instead.  Very disappointing as our perception is that she intended to keep if had we not asked to see the manager."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Hooters,  Every time I come in with my husband and teenaged son, the waitresses are always so pleasant and helpful.  I love their parmesan chicken wings so I keep going back for more.  Anyone saying that this place is demeaning to women, I say this. No one is forcing you to go here.   Nobody is forcing these girls to work here.  I am sure that these girls make nice tips as they are so friendly to the customers.  I wish a lot of other restaurants in Madison had waitresses half as friendly as the Hooters' girls.  Excellent location just off I-90.  Food has always been good.  It's not gourmet but good for bar food."}
{"text":"Obsessed with these chicken wings. I drive across town once a week to eat them!!! My favorite. Loooove."}
{"text":"I meet up with a friend for some drinks and I was thinking of getting some food. I am sitting in the bar area and I notice one of the waitresses sitting on the sink, talking to some costumers, cleaning her dirty shoes with the same rag she was cleaning the counter with. After seeing this,  I immediately lose my appetite and do not order food!!!  After being disgusted and leaving, I post a picture on social media and someone told me her name is Ashley. Unless you like the idea of eating or drinking off of plates or glass cups where someone had there sweaty ass n dirty shoes sitting where they wash and place \"clean cups/plates\" then this is the place to go.   Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of hooters.  I usually receive a great server and the food is amazing.  I love the boneless wings with 911 sauce.  I do not drink alcohol, so I cannot comment on their selection.  I can say that I frequent this Hooters a few times a week.  It is a great place to unwind and the location is amazing.  This is the perfect time of year to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Typical shitty wings, and overpriced Ontario beer from girls who couldn't get bartender jobs in the bars surrounding the clubs in the Entertainment District. I don't know, the American hooters' have girls who look like supermodels. This location has girls who look like they're from the suburbs (our blonde bartender told us she was from \"the 905\" which I assume is some suburb). Brought my clients here hoping they'd have a great time. It was ok.. Had a great time at the Ballroom down the street right after with the server working the section next to us."}
{"text":"Some key words that come to mind when eating the New Orleans shrimp are \"delicious\" and \"fantastic!\" The sauce was spicy but not to hot that I had to drink a bunch of water.  A couple of things I would say about the new item is that it was not as filling as I would have like for the $9.99 price.  It was good but def. left me hungry for more.  The bread was a plus but just me longing for something else afterwards.  The bread was toasted perfectly and it was delicious but just not enough.  Overall I think the shrimp is a good addition to the menu and I'm glad to see Hooters is branching off from its normal wings and beer options.  Good job Hooters!"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience today at hooters. Shortly after being seated and served a beer, my girlfriend and I were then promptly ignored for 20 minutes. It was a Tuesday night and they had plenty of staff and maybe 1/8 of their tables full. The kicker here is the waitress spent 10 minutes flirting with the table directly next to us and when she was done WALKED RIGHT PAST US. We eventually got fed up with the lack of service and walked to the bartender to ask for our check. This was the first time in my life I've never left a tip."}
{"text":"I've been at this Hooters many times, and it's not for the outfits.  Something about Hooters' addicting Buffalo Chicken Sandwich brings me back time and time again. Although I don't appreciate the waitress pulling down and adjusting her top as she's taking my bf and I's orders, I keep coming back for that darn sandwich.   I like going here because I only have to order one thing and I'm stuffed. You get a huge plate of fries along with a big burger, and I can never finish the fries, sometimes not even the burger. The service is on top of things and usually friendly.  I hear their wings are pretty good too. The seating isn't that comfy - hard stools/chairs, but they have lots of tvs. They are a must-go for Monday Night Football and I've won a bbq before to reward my beer drinking in a raffle. They have great give-aways during the NFL season, so once again, go for MNF! They also have some great drink specials.  The problem with this Hooters is that it doesn't attract the best crowd, which is why I'm usually there on Mondays for more of a football crowd and less of a creepy one. If you're worried about the servers.. don't worry, ladies, you have nothing to be jealous about."}
{"text":"Stopped in one night last week for drinks and appetizers. It was a beautiful evening and we were seated on the patio. It took 15 minutes to get two beers, which we gave a pass on because it was packed inside.  Then the misters came on. We were pretty much soaked within a few minutes and by this time the patio had filled up so we couldn't move tables. Since it was only about 85 degrees out so I asked the server if it would be possible to get the misters turned off and she said no, just move which I pointed out we couldn't do.  Twice she came by our table telling us she would go check on the rest of our food and twice I told her that we had already gotten and eaten everything we had ordered. Then she didn't give back my companion's driver license so we had to go back to get that. Server was dumb as a box of rocks. Won't be back to that location."}
{"text":"Don't call me a pig for eating at Hooters. I was driving in the area when I saw the restaurant and got a sudden craving for chicken wings and fried pickles. No I am not pregnant ( I'm a guy), but I do like their chicken wings. The joint in Mesa/ Gilbert is on the small side, but is in typical Hooter decor. I sat down and was informed that it was all u can eat wing day. JACKPOT! Now you can call me a pig. Because by the time I was finished I ate 20 wings and a plate of fried pickles. I had the Samurai and the Cajun styles with Hooters hot sauce on the side. The wait time for each order of wings was a little slow, but they were served hot. Over all a good day for a coronary,"}
{"text":"Walked in on Saturday afternoon sat down and after 25 minutes left.  Not one employee helped us at all. 3 girls working the bar and not once did anyone come out from behind the bar. They were to busy drinking with the regulars to help anyone else.  It looked like the manager was drinking along with them.  We were not off in a corner where they could not see us we were one table away from the bar.   Don't waste your money in a place that can't be bothered with the  customer who is not buying the waitress drinks."}
{"text":"Good friendly place to wine down from a hard week at work. Great wings and beer. There alcohol specials are not that great tho :( wish they could add a little more on their draft..."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service waited 20 mins without even a menu,water,or even a napkin!!!! Was only noticed after walking out the door worst experience ever for my first time trying hooters wouldn't recommend this location to anyone!!!! Waitress literally seated 3 tables and just walked around us like we were invisible!!!!"}
{"text":"I highly advise everybody wait, to eat here. They just opened yesterday and I had horrible service when I came to dine today. Waitress was not familiar with any of hooters menu to include drinks. Hooters didn't have any drink menus. (Waitress told me they were getting them on Friday) Food took way too long and instead of the waitress inquiring about my order she was taking \"selfies\" with all her friends. Drinks came in a plastic cup. I was told they only took cash after I had sat down and ordered and had my drink. And was directed to an atm to get cash that charged me 6 dollars...not a very good experience."}
{"text":"This Hooters location seemed pretty dumpy, part of the floor was missing and blocked off. The food was ok, just like any other. Our waitress was very nice and we had good service. I probably wouldn't come back to this location due to it not being kept up."}
{"text":"dont get all the bad reviews about the food and what not....its HOOTERS not a 5 star place....the service is ok, you have a bunch of wanna be barbie dolls trying to serve food what do you expect? just shut up and eat those delicious daytona wings!"}
{"text":"Awful, just awful. The food was awful, the staff are incredibly rude, I guess from being hit on all day and night, service took forever, would never go back....ever."}
{"text":"Decent wait staff and the food is okay. Not the best Hooters but definitely not the worst."}
{"text":"The hostess sat us, then forgot about us. We waited for 20 minutes, nothing. The servers were more interested in the lonely middle aged guys and totally ignored us. They look good but they don't give me hope for humanity. We went to the Outback (which was amazing)."}
{"text":"The place is fairly clean, but the food fails to shine, not only is the wings below average, their wing ain't made to order and they came out cold. The service is basic."}
{"text":"I love this place. The $9 platter (10 boneless wings anrfries) is the best. The best bartending staff and managment. The waitress are hit or miss. But everything else is on point"}
{"text":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT Went on a Saturday night and the waitress notified us that they were short on staff in the kitchen so our orders would take some time. That's ok,  but when you order a nacho platter and they say sorry we are all out it is a sign that it is going to be a bad evening. Then we ordered boneless chicken wings, bacon wrapped chicken wings and buffalo chicken wings. The response was sorry all out. I kid you not. This is a sports bar- restaurant? These are staples for a sports bar! The time was not even 7 pm yet and they are all out? The beer selection is good but guess what. They are all out of our two selections. So we a group of 8 guys had to order Heineken. Burgers are sub par and they cannot make decent french fries.  Come on.   They get 1 star which is way more than they should be getting. Their saving grace is that it was only their 3rd week open for business. Give them 6 months to get their act together."}
{"text":"I know you should not except so much from this establishment but even with lowered standards I very disappointed. Service was slow and I was unable to decider if it was laziness or ignorance on the part of the staff"}
{"text":"I am far from a hairy-pitted feminist but recently I walked pass this place and there was some sort of promotion going on where two of the the waitresses were outside twirling hula-hoops and it had me shaking my head. No idea what it was for. And in retrospect, I guess it was for nothing except to get noticed. And it worked. Kudos.  I get that the uniform requirement is probably wear two sizes too small, but sweetheart, if you're pushing three or four sizes out of your league, upgrade. You'll look more sexy if the \"clothes\" hug your curves and not squeeze the f*ck out of them so that they're looking for any means of escaping.  On with the food... I don't remember.  Now before you think the 2-star rating is based on the scantilly clad waitresses coupled with my insecurities about my own body, let me explain: The food was ok, whatever it was, and it went well with whatever alcoholic beverage I was drinking at the time. But the phrase \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is perfect for this place. The waitress was a bit rude, inattentive and seemed like no matter how she treated her customers, she was bound to get a good tip anyway. She probably did but mainly because the table was drunk and bad at math.  The rooftop patio is pretty sweet but be warned that there's a minimal amount of shade up there. Those umbrellas, they do nothing on those intensely hot summer days. As an alternative to the coveted rooftop, the mainfloor isn't that bad when the shutters are open and you're free to people-watch, but why would you since the T&A is serving you drinks."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experiences at various Hooters located all over the country and not necessarily at this one location.  If you've been to one Hooters you've basically been to all of them, the only visible change is the quality of the scenery. Having said that, Hooters has still managed to become an American institution. As most should know by now the food here is one cut above average at best, my nephew once found remnants of a feather in his wings! TASTY DUH! Then again, I don't think anyone goes to Hooters for the food. I've always thought that Hooters could expand their beer line up quite a bit but that has yet to happen.  My primary motivation to go here is to set the mood for the rest of the evening, is that simple! Another reason is logistics, this is a good staging area for when your new in town and need to get a feel for where the action is. I agree with Kimberly. Hooters is hooters. However I disagree with her rating! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Bland food..... Not like the many others across the country..... Building is in need of a renovation.... Hotel rooms are below expectations! Feels more like a country side cheap motel."}
{"text":"Sorry but we had a waitress that had an attitude and thought she was hot stuff and she was not and was a horrible waitress her name was \"Aaliyah\" and she had a fake smile she was not authentic very bad waitress get rid of her.. the food was OK her service was terrible and gave us a very bad experience.. We will spread the word don't get that waitress.. We wanted to complain but my friends felt funny doing so with her there. I belong to a large Hot Rod club and go to the pavilions a lot but I will tell all the members not to go here if that waitress is working. Hope the others are better.."}
{"text":"The place isn't bad but the waitress (Aaliyah) , was terrible my girl and I waited so long for our food as she was talking with her coworkers ,it seemed like she did not know what she was doing she wore a very fake smile it was not authentic at all , not like the other girls ,she had an attitude and we noticed she was only friendly when she went back to her coworkers and when she came back to us she was completely different with an attitude and did not know how to serve a table. She even had help..  Get rid of this girl try somebody new there must be someone out there who can be authentic friendly with a real smile. And not fake.. If I were the manager she'd be gone.. Bad for business.."}
{"text":"I wings were COLD and there was this miniscule amount of sauce on our wings WTF. Our waitress was ok she was training someone so we saw both but not really. When we are ready to leave we get our check ONLY the check no booklet to put our money in. So we give the money to the \"waitress in training\" and proceed to walk out but are being followed then asked if we paid WTF YES we did AND gave then a ten dollar tip on 30 dollars (I was pissed my husband did this but whatever) I understand some ppl skip out on meals and all that but we were there with our family I was insulted."}
{"text":"Meh.  Yeah, that sums it up.  No excuses; food, service, pricing, wait staff, all meh.  Would've won a point for Firestone Walker as their \"IPA beer\", but $7 for 12oz in a plastic PBR cup... could've at least made it a 16oz red dixie cup.  Food... the waitress was ecstatic about all the items on the menu, but \"really, we're known for our wings.\"  Okay, let's try an order of boneless.  Maybe that's the wrong answer, but they were dry, the sauce was underwhelming, and the ranch was particularly runny.  Service really slid downhill after the initial order.  A random server dropped off the food, as in, \"here's your wings\", and left before I could ask about another beer, confirm it was the right order, etc.  Now I get it, an establishment like \"Hooters\", quality or price isn't necessarily the top priorities, but if you're going to rely on service, on making me feel special, well, epic fail.  It does seem that a larger group of single guys, especially a table ordering lots of drinks, will probably fare better... the waitress obliged the table next to me, by posing for multiple pictures/selfies.  Maybe the \"big tips\" tables is the right strategy, and I'm not expecting cuddles and hugs, but I do expect at least average service for a Tuesday night when it's not busy, during a soft open.  This is Vegas, Hooters isn't the last bastion for men to forgo a PC climate, and appreciate women dressed in flattering attire.  If I really want wings, I'm sure I can find better."}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends went in for dinner during the all you can eat wings and we sat at the bar. Courtney and Audrey were behind the bar. Audrey was very nice & informant. She made sure we had everything we needed and suggested great sauces when we're questionable on what to get. We will be back"}
{"text":"Seated quickly and everything good so far til we ordered. Everyone at our table ordered a burger which is pretty standard. None if our burgers were cooked right even though we were asked how we liked them. Also I wanted to try a new drink so I tried their hula piña colada drink. Whatever can't remember the name exact. I was offered water until my drink arrived and noticed it was taking a while to get it. Once it got to the table I noticed that it had been sitting a while as the drink was now overflowing over the glass due to the ice melting. Marisa apologized for the wait to which I was like that's fine. I had to then get up to ask for my check and a box to finally which got tired of waiting and just walked outside to wait having my wife pay. Totally annoyed and will never go back. Should have just eaten at castles n coasters would have saved me the irritation and at least 25$!"}
{"text":"Food was so so, service was pretty good, beer cheese pretzel was BOMB. Price was definitely better than most places I found on the strip. We went back an extra time for more beer cheese pretzels."}
{"text":"Eh ask for we'll done burger but wasn't well done service good I supposed but not a place I would go to again anytime soon"}
{"text":"2 stars for the quality of food and service. 3rd star is for the eye candy. Fortunately this location has a good talent selection.  Wings came out cold. Beer came out in plastic cups.. Then got warm.  Server had bad timing in coming back around.  In the end it was \"ok\"."}
{"text":"like all the other Hooter's i've been too.. the food was just as expected.  the SERVICE is another story though..  I visited later in the night with my brother and another friend.. the place wasn't packed at all - only two other parties in the room.    - the waitress lagged on the water refills  - charged us for something that SHE forgot  - never stopped be the  table to see if we needed anything   i love hooters, but i'm afraid the only thing that will keep me from this location is the SERVICE."}
{"text":"Something has drastically changes with Hooter wings. Not sure what happen. They just do not seem the same quality. But the price has not changed."}
{"text":"The staff,  which consisted of 2 people, cared about nothing more than the 5 people at the end of the bar.  Kitchen staff upset at people ordering food.  Bartender complaining about everything out loud.  If no stars were an option,  no stars it would be.  Your food is not good enough for any stars."}
{"text":"I called in a pickup order and realize during our conversation that the normal celery garnish is not included any more and there would be an extra charge if I wanted the celery. We order 20 sections (equal to 10 full wings) and they only gave a 1oz (ranch or blue cheese) dipping sauce; the wing would not fit into the container it's so small. Any extra dipping sauce the same size, would cost an extra .89 cents.  The wing were very greasy and the drumette sections had more fat than meat the flats were mediocre. Overall I wasted $20."}
{"text":"Although the service was good, as it usually is, the food was terrible. Their quality has taken an incredibly sharp nose dive. And the atmoshere at the Palms Casino is reminiscent of eating lunch in a chemistry lab. It's a real shame, I've been eating at hooters for nearly 30 years but I think I'm done now. I had my whole family with me and they all agree. It just lacked the rustic flare of the originals."}
{"text":"I have NEVER been to a Hooters before!! And yes I have heard how awesome the wings are and all but i just HAD to have a swiss mushroom burger... lol! The burger was HUGE and sooooo tasty! Our waiter was great and didnt flirt with my husband as the other did,... I was very happy with my experience! :)"}
{"text":"Hit and miss on the food, servers are friendly but really slow to serve. Not good at handling large groups.  Beer was cold, but avoid the new Moscow mules they don't know how to make them (they admitted this)."}
{"text":"My waitress Karla was HORRIBLE!  The only time I saw here was when I ordered and when she brought my food to me.  She never asked if I wanted another beer or a refill on my soda.  I was going to hang out and have a couple of beers and watch the games however when I was halfway done with my food and beer, she brought my check and said, \"Take your time\".  I waited tables 20+ years ago and I am sure that the rule of not bringing the check until the customer has expressed they are done or have asked for it still applys.  I left and went across the street and drank and watched the game.  I will say this, I ate here the day before as it was across the street from my hotel.  I had great service at lunch however the wait staff is not very friendly.  Hooters use to be based on friendly service and business guys like myself who travel and eat alone liked going there because you could at the very least have some friendly conversation.  I guess that is why the pasf CEO Colby left Hooters for Twin Peaks.  He saw the decline."}
{"text":"There were about 15 people in the place and we walked out after waiting over 10 minutes for a waitress to offer us a drink, let alone take our order.    WOULD NOT recommend this place at all.  The WORST wait staff ever.  Ended up going to Whiskey River, great service.  Seated, Greeted, and Eating appitizers within 10 minutes.  QUALITY service and food at WHISKEY RIVER."}
{"text":"If you want below average service and the worst wings in the city this is your spot...wouldnt recommend."}
{"text":"Service was ok, wings changed so beware what u order. Not the same classic wings as before apparently u have to ask for them. Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Never been to a better Hooters in my life. I am originally from Ft. Lauderdale Florida and have been to just about every Hooters in the area. Not a single one of them compares. Yes one on Ft Lauderdale is on the beach and has a nice view.....of the beach. I'd rather the view at this Hooters. I swear to god every single girl there is sexy and actually lives up to the restaurants name.....Hooters. The food is the same everywhere you go but besides for the chicken wings, why else go to Hooters? Love this Hooters and look forward to wing wednesdays every week. If you havent been I strongly suggest going. Happy Valentines Day!!"}
{"text":"While I was staying at the hotel I decided to have breakfast at the hooters restaurant downstairs. Not only were they over priced but they automatically added a donation charge to check. Who does that?! Its up to the customer whether or not they want to donate. This should not be pushed on the customer. At my next stay I got wings. I asked for the medium boneless wings. When I got my food all I got were plain dry wings with a small side of medium sauce. Who prepares wings this way?! This place is over priced and from my point of view like to take money from their customers. Would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Ate there aug 8th good food great service from Ashley and Ashley"}
{"text":"My friends and I have have been coming to   Hooters the past 10years.  We fly in from New Oleans for The Panthers. We all grew up in Buffalo NY. so we like Buffalo wings. Each year, we ask for our wings to be cooked extra,extra crispy.  Each year we have to send our order back because the wings are under cooked, like rubber, totally gross. No different  to night. Our sever was very good. Food Sucked.  300$ bill would be just fine,  if the wings were cooked right. We all dedided Hooters will never be our choice any longer.  You would think they would know how to cook wings, the hot waitress no longer make up for poor food service."}
{"text":"Service was very very good!  I went for wings and a cold beer and got those plus some of the best service ever.  Chantel rocks!  She was super attentive, knew the menu well and drew the cutest owl on my sons kiddie cup of water.  I was torn between 2 sauces and she brought both.  She asked me if i wanted ranch or blue cheese and I told her to surprise me.  She did...with both!  We had to have the wings recooked because we ordered them well done and they weren't.  She did it with a smile on her face.  We also asked for a new hotdog bun cause the first one was a rock and she replaced it promptly and with a smile on her face.  The only downside was the other waitresses sitting at the table behind us with either a gentleman manager or shift leader talking about their nights out.  Definitely not what I wanted my son to hear.  I turned around at least 3 times before the gentleman apologized and they moved to the side station to continue their chatter.  I am assuming they use that table as a server/shift table to eat at b/c at all times one or more person was sitting there either eating or talking.  All in all I appreciate great service and Chantel gave be better service than I received at Craft Steakhouse last week."}
{"text":"If I could rate it any lower I would!  My wife and myself went in and were seated after checking our menus we waited for our server and waited and waited. I tried to get one of the wait staff and watched two other groups get seated and then get their drink orders. After 10 min we just got up and left..we walked by the hostess and she just watched us go.  Never again will we go to this hooters"}
{"text":"I went yesterday because I purchased a groupon , go figured they had an offer in the casino that is way cheaper than the groupon that purchased . But that's not the worst , the worst was the serviced we ordered wings , beers and a chili soup , the chili soup came out first so I had to be eating by myself (since I do not like the wings ) , 20 minutes after the wings finally showed up , our server gave me a refill , but never asked the other person who was drinking soda as well ."}
{"text":"Good patio and cheap Bud and Bud light.  Great spot to stop before or after a Jays game."}
{"text":"I had the worst service I have ever had...not only did they mess up my order twice but they put the same old dried up shrimp back on my sandwich...Needless to say I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes and wasn't acknowledged by anyone. Moved to the other side and had to wait another 20 minutes in line just to be seated. Not sure if this is normal for a Friday night at 1:00....ugh"}
{"text":"I've been going there about 2 months now and every time I go in there Brenda takes care of us.. great server,  very friendly  good service.. for those who are disappointed I was just go back and  sit in  Brenda's  section.. you will  have  a great time"}
{"text":"excellent service....unbelievable nice bartenders and waitresses....A++"}
{"text":"I expected something different being that it says \"World's BIGGEST Hooters\" I expected atmosphere to be unique idk.. . . Anyhow our waiter was really sweet and nice. . .  Helpful and very customer service with us. . . .  The prices and portions just don't go with it (but than again it's Vegas, what do I expect) I was scared to ask for water thought they would charge me for that too. . .  Than lemon pepper medium were super dried with no flavor. ..   first time tried Chipotle with honey was better. . .  My margarita omg in the menu says \"frozen or on the rock\" yet they have blenders but not used so was unhappy with that. . .  Other than that it's alright. ...  I wouldn't return unless they make some changes . . .."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location several times a week for lunch, but I will never go back here again. The service is beyond bad and the when I spoke to the manager he walked away from me while I was talking. My recommendation is spend your money anywhere else."}
{"text":"I often come to this Hooters and ask for Jayd she is great and always checks the food and orders to make sure everything is done on time.   Very friendly and I would suggest her serving you as she is a very outgoing person. She knows what she is doing and loves what she does. Jayd you are great!!!  Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, however , the food was disgustingly disturbing. Not only is the the food horrible but it is expensive. This was the 3rd time in my life that I've been to hooters and every single time it's the same thing."}
{"text":"Went back to this place in March, the staff behind the bar weren't really friendly or engaging. Did not comp us for playing video poker. The bartender didn't know how to make a Vegas Bomb, in a Vegas bar! After we paid the bill, they were nice enough to give some match play coupons after I asked for them."}
{"text":"This was one of the saddest little Hooters I've ever been in. It was quite empty on a Tuesday night (a little odd considering the Flames game was on), filled only with a few lonely old men and a couple of criminal-types coming to pick their girlfriends up after a shift.  Not exciting in the least. We had a beer and got the hell out of there. If you're looking for somewhere quiet to go and pine, this is the place...."}
{"text":"The newest Hooters in Charlotte but the same old servers. I mean no offense to the young ladies, but I think I rather see half of them in T-shirts and Jeans.  Odd location for a hooters... ZERO traffic during the day with no chance in the world of a suit walking in and in the night you have nothing but business travelers from the Marriott looking for Ms. Right Now.  Sorry... old enough to be over that scene but young enough to still want a good scene.  Not here."}
{"text":"We probably ordered the worst things on the menu which made it a bad Hooters experience.  Fried pickled chips (which are awesome at Mountainside Restaurant) and deep fried chicken wings.  Both dishes were soaked in oil.  Deep fried foods - yes, I know they're cooked in oil and they're fattening.  But I didn't expect to literally squeeze dripping oil out of the chicken wings; and we ordered the wings \"mild\" which was actually plain tasting.  Only had a few and it felt like a rock in the bottom of my stomach all day.  Our server was attentive at first but then was MIA; I had to chase her down after a different server wouldn't take our payment for our meal.  The atmosphere was up to par - Hooters Sports Bar it was."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch last Friday and my oh my was the service extremely slow. We had a large group so we split to two tables. The other table all got their food half an hour before we did and were getting ready to leave just as our food arrived. My friend and I split two appetizers- fried pickles and cheese sticks, and I understand that it's an app but the portions were very small... especially for the price that charged. Each app was about $9.   The server was friendly, however she rarely came back to see if we needed anything. We pretty much ran out of water after 10 minutes and she didn't bring us new jugs until the food arrived.   The food was really meh as well and makes you super thirsty after! I probably had litres of water after the meal as I felt dehydrated the rest of the day. Drinks were alright, bit watered down. But you get what you paid for.   It does have a really nice roof top patio so if you want some sunlight and just drinks, then I would suggest giving the place a try. Otherwise for food, I would suggest going to any one of the restaurants across the street. The food is much better and you are pretty much paying about the same."}
{"text":"Wings and buffalo shrimp were great. Fried pickles were cooked just right. Service was above average but it was a very slow night. As always, Hooters didn't disappoint. Will be back next time in town!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on 6/17. Excellent service.  Renee, the Hooters girl serving me was courteous, friendly, and very attentive. The wings were excellent and fresh. Very happy with my visit. It was my birthday and the entire Hooters staff gathered around me and sang a catchy Hooters happy birthday song.  It was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Two thumbs down, thought we could give it another shot, food just not the same and over priced drinks with inattentive bartender/servers. Never, ever coming back!"}
{"text":"No, we didn't get chicken wings for dinner, which is what they're normally big on besides the hot chicks. We opted for a sandwich and a hot dog instead.  I guess it was alright. I was more excited about their free wi-fi than anything .. oh and my blackened mahi sandwich. We also ordered the fried pickles, only because the menu had a warning saying it would be addicting. Really, it wasn't. It was lightly battered and served with thousand island which made it more sour. Probably would've been better with ranch? Maybe, but def not with the thousand island. Like I said the mahi was good--it was moist and very decent in size and was only 9 bucks. My bf got the big dog combo with a side of curly fries. I must say, these curly fries were \"naked.\" I'm used to eating seasoned curly fries so I wasn't a fan of these. The cheese sauce we dipped it in was also real salty. As far as the hot dog goes, the guy said \"everything is real salty\" but the portion was pretty big. The prices are reasonable as well, we only paid 24 bucks including tip.  Service was good, the waitress was real friendly. The place is pretty small and not only were there good looking chicks, but also a lot of good looking dudes. Definitely a good place to hang out with the friends, watch sports, and drink."}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative 5 I would. My fiance and I went there for dinner last night and both of us ended up with food poisoning... I started throwing up at 3am and my fiance stayed home from work today because he can't leave the toilet. I don't not recommend coming here......  Not only that the manager was freaking out on an employee right in front of us.... Not good for business..."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed in this place. They don't even deserve a 1 star. I wish I would have Yelped this place first. We arrived in LV about 4:30am wanting a place to get some sleep and a shower before continuing our 1,200 mile trip we thought this would be a good option. We pulled up, yes pulling a trailer we weren't greeted by valet they simply said you need to park around the corner next to the hooters truck. Husband on crutches and having to try to keep a baby asleep so I could get some sleep. Ok. Make our way in to book a room the lady at the front desk was beyond rude, she kept changing her story. Check out time was at 11:00 then it was 12:00 among other things. Finally get the key to our room she didn't even point us to the right direction. Here's your key tour in the baby tower. Tried asking one of the cleaning people where the bay tower was and she completely ignored us. Kept right on walking. Found our way to the room. AC doesn't work, great. They want us to switch rooms. Yea sleeping baby, no. Sending repair guy. Husband messes with AC gets it working. Not sure if repair guy ever showed or if we were finally asleep... get up for check out shower in the handicap shower. Water all over the bath room. No hot water. Clean up water, husband slips getting into shower. By the time he is done bathroom is completely flooded and coming out to carpet. They send security to check out the slipping issue, they said front desk would take care of us. Go check out, front desk doesn't care, no apologies, no compensation for everything we deal with. Said we can take it up with the guy who handles These issues. We call him. He said the front desk should take care of it. Serious?! Way to pass the lame. And not one happy employee here. Maybe the company treats them like they do their guests? I will NEVER step foot in here again and I will encourage anyone I know to stay away also!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friend's birthday - although it's a novelty thing, I thought that they'd at least have acceptable pub fare.  Our table was nasty - our menus were literally stuck to the table and made consistent riiiiiiip sounds as we picked them up over the course of the evening (this was actually kind of entertaining, if not absolutely disgusting). Heard of a washcloth? Paper towel? Hose?  The others I was with got beer and wings - they looked decent, and were cheap, so I'm pretty sure that was nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the boneless wings, and from the pic on the menu, thought they'd be kind of like chicken fingers...what arrived was some basket of gnarly chicken bits smothered in a thick sauce - I gave it the ol' college try and ate one piece, then just decided to cut my losses and ask for it to be sent back (which I hate doing, because I didn't want to be the person who sends food back at Hooters like a pretentious snot). The waitress was nice enough and actually got it removed from my bill, which was great. So, props to her.  Although, at the end, when we asked for the final bills, she said she couldn't do separate bills because it was too difficult... it was literally 6 people who all had beer and wings. Take the total and divide it by 6 :|  Was super unimpressed and HUNGRY at this point, so we left and made a stop at Burrito Boyz down the street - which was awesome, as per usual.  Went into it thinking I'd set the bar low, but eeek. It wasn't even fun! The whole place had this tired vibe to it...a bachelorette party came and left DURING our time there.  Sad."}
{"text":"I don't know if I've ever had a worse Buffalo chicken wrap...and I was drunk for this experience.  The service was slow and the food was not good. Sorry, but what even is this place? I don't know what I was even expecting.  All in all, the Buffalo chicken wrap was an overall disappointment. I don't even know where to start. It was bland, the sauce had minimal flavour, there was barely any fillings apart from some mediocre chicken, and maybe a little bit of soggy lettuce. I'm sure the other food my friends ordered was nothing but aggressively average and ordinary as well.  Do yourself a favour; Skip Hooters and head elsewhere.   But let's be real...since when do people go to hooters for their fine cuisine?"}
{"text":"Love their wings but gonna try a burger today..."}
{"text":"We went there last weekend, it was very loud and the food was poor.  The fish taco's were poor, the fish must have been old and not fresh.  We will never go there again"}
{"text":"I loved going to hooters for wings!! But just left there today after spending over $50 - the wings were slimy, cold, and just plain bad.  The fries were cold.  This is too bad - since Hooters has nothing else going for them.  I miss the old Hooters!!! I will never ever go to this Hooters again.  Get a new cook!!!  Wings aren't that hard to make!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, and the food was mediocre at best. When talking to a manager afterword he was extremely rude. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving them a one star is because the manager attempted to make it better for us.  My friend and I decided to go to Hooters tonight. I had never been to Hooters prior and was excited to try them for the 1st time. I had heard amazing things about their chicken wings.  Well we got there and due to a basketball game (Warriors), it was a busy night. We waited 40 minutes to be seated. After we were finally seated, we ordered our food and waited another 40 minutes for our food to be served. When we received our boneless chicken wings, they were cold and dry. Worst part was that they barely had any sauce on them. We still ate them because we were starving after waiting almost an hour and a half. We also received our sliders. The sliders were also cold and the bread was kind of hard. We had to wait a few minutes for our curly fries which was probably the best part of our meal as they were fresh. I finished my drink and our waitress not once attempted to refill my drink. I even put the cup at the edge of the table hoping she would notice.  I must say, I don't know what the hype is about. I was really disappointed. Yeah, they have pretty waitresses but the food sucks and the service sucks. I would have been better off going to In and Out down the street. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Hooters in america. The girls and wings are hotter than most others in the country.  On a cross country trip 10 years ago I  rode with a friend who was infatuated with this place. There was only one in Mass at the time and he never went, so during our 6,000 mile trek we hit up about a dozen of these places. Some were good, some sucked, but the wings and girls at this downtown phx location made me decide to stay in az for a year.  Food at this location just seems better than the ones up in the northeast. They seem to add alot more spice in order to keep up with the plethora of mexican restaurants in the area. So if you like your wings hot, you unfortunately gotta leave the bland northeast.  Beer as long as you buy it by the pitcher is affordable, but if you come in during happy hour, expected to get nice and drunk while not going poor. As far as the other reason to go to hooters:the girls, you're gonna love this place. Let's face it, all hooters waitress are conning you just like a stripper would at the club. Here it doesn't seem they are faking it that much. Besides that they are hot as hell! With over 100 days of 100 degree heat in the valley of the sun, your use to seeing alot of hot girls walking around with next to nothing on. Yet hooters seems to still pluck away some of the best and stick out. There aren't many reasons to go to downtown phx, but this hooters definitely makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love the location. But the service at the bar is horrible. The manager with niners jersey made feel better. But Danielle and the other bartender with brunette hair on at that time  horrible bartenders. Need a attitude readjustment. I ask for a beverage. And she seem to get upset for me asking. Also never ask if we want water or a refill .  Being a local to Las Vegas customers service is key. Other then that I love watching games there."}
{"text":"This is first for me.  I just left the restaurant without ordering.  When i got there at lunch time, i was told there was a few minutes wait.  I looked around and there was hardly anyone there. Finally the same lady told me to take any seat.   I waited for about 20 minutes and asked a waitress that i was ready to order. She said she was not my waitress and that she will call some one else. I waited another 10 minutes and i looked at the corner and saw three waitressess just sitting and chit chatting. I just left. That was the first time i left a restaurant without ordering. Hey mr manager you have to do something with your waitress. This place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but the service and professional attitude of the employees working there is why I go back every week thank you Ashley vickie nyla and the rest of the wonderful people who work there"}
{"text":"It's always been a tradition to eat @ a Hooters when we visit in AZ.  I give this location a 3.5.  The hostess couldn't seat our party of 7 and 2 kids properly, but we made good use of the tall table with stools and low table with chairs that she gave us.  The food took a long time to come..but it was bearable when you're conversating with friends.  The HOTT wings were so good...too bad, they accidentally gave us blue cheese instead of ranch.  I had the \"naked\" wings this time, and to my surprise, they were actually just like the breaded ones.  So my final tally of the place is:  Great food!!  C minus for service!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have every had. Over 30 min for a beer. Will not return to this hooters."}
{"text":"Fried chicken  wings is too oily, burger with bacon is good. Staff needs more training. How to talk to a customer. When asked for our  check. Just say who is you server 3 time in a rude manner. Absolutely not coming  back to this place."}
{"text":"I love hooters!  This however was the worst food I have ever had at any location.  The chicken was so dry and cheese sauce was hard and tasted disgusting."}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I entered. I found an open spot at the bar to sit. My order was taken immediately. The staff was friendly, the food hot and tasty, and the environment very clean looking.   My server did ask stop a few times during my visit to see if I needed anything else. Other than that she was not at the bar."}
{"text":"Rochelle's service was amazing on Monday. Fast friendly service with a smile and she earned every penny of a rather generous tip from my boss."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible experience. My family came to eat dinner and the service was horrible. We were greeted by a rude hostess that wouldn't even walk us to the table she just pointed and said \"y'all can sit there\" the waitress was pleasant but over worked, we waited 30min for food, our appetizers came out with our food, the pickles and pretzels were cold, part of our food was missing and we never received waters that we asked for when we first sat down. After we told another waitress what had taken place and asked for the manager, he never came and they brought more food and mentioned that they wouldn't charge for it. We are extremely disappointed because we weren't asking for free food, we just wanted the manager to know about our experience. When it was time for the bill we let our waitress know that the manager never came, she walked away for another 10min to come back and say her general manager was too busy to come out but took some stuff off the bill. This was the worse experience ever. Will not be back ."}
{"text":"This review is late, but felt moved to post. Mother's Day was a pretty good experience. I was apprehensive at first, worried it would be too risque for my younger children, but it was fine. Servers wore skin-colored tights, totally appropriate. It wasn't busy, but service was still a bit slow. The specials for mother's were suitable. The chicken salad was delicious. My kids were happy with their choices as well. Overall, they helped us make great memories :))"}
{"text":"Out of town on business and had a craving for wings. Hooters was right by my hotel so I thought I would give it a try. Man was I disappointed! I ordered 6pc naked wings and 6pc boneless. I received 12pc naked wings, I did get 6 of each sauce I requested. The drumsticks were nice but the wings were terribly small....I mean really small!  I ordered fries 5-10 mins within getting my wings. I knew the small wings weren't going to do the job. Guess what....never got them! She presented me with my check and I paid and left. I probably won't go back to another Hooters for another year or so. I believe some of the problem may have been that she was too worried about the fact it was her birthday! I sure do hope Amanda C was just having an off day."}
{"text":"This restaurant is advertised as the biggest Hooters in the world but to me this is the BEST Hooters where I have been.  I cannot recommend this place enough. The girls, the managers, the food... everything!  First class service in Las Vegas. Hands down!"}
{"text":"Just came from hooters, we sat at the bar and the service was bad. I sat with my husband and had a difficult time getting the attention of our waitress who seemed more interested in the male dinners. Will not return anytime soon, was hoping to have a good day."}
{"text":"Ok so I rarely give a one star, but they deserve it.  First off, I think its terrible that they don't let you get 2 flavors on 10 wings, any place does this even Buffalo Wild Wings.    But my problem is with the snobby single digit IQ waitresses who act like they're runway models.   Hooters managers hire these girls with hopes of getting laid one day....(if you haven't seen the Hooters episode on Undercover Boss, I suggest you watch it).....but what tends to happen is some of these girls have absolutely no common etiquette nor have any manners.  Usually the prettier a woman is, the less common sense she really has.  In addition, she's full of personal problems that brings with her to work.  They'll be all smiles and giggles with one customer and be the complete opposite with another.    I had this waitress who was giving me an attitude the whole time I was there, and WAS TEXTING !!!   Her priority was TEXTING first, then answering me second!!!. Newsflash,  when I'm paying you money, which pays your salary, i EXPECT you to smile and give the same service to every single person in the restaurant the same way.  If not, then your manager failed as an employee as well as your regional manager who allowed such degenerates to be employed.  Oh ya and your breaded wings taste like crap now, job well done, I actually used to like them."}
{"text":"This review is on Take-out Only... so I just ordered two separate orders today, and the only thing that was a problem was the busy signal I kept getting for approx hr to order my food. The place was not even busy. But anyways. Both orders were for chicken wings and curly fries. I had the original bone in 911 wings which were good. The price was $19 bucks, which is pretty damn steep for 10 wings. They were good but not returning for 19 dollar good."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband Friday night and sat in the bar. It was not crowded but sat there 10 minutes and not one waitress came by and asked what we wanted.  Got up and left and went to Brentwood."}
{"text":"If you're going here for food, you're at the wrong place. Beer and eye candy is the specialty and at this location it ain't half bad. :)"}
{"text":"Okay okay okay.  It's hooters.  Its reputation precedes it.... But my curiosity got the better of me, and well, they serve beer.    I put my feminist side away for a few moments to give it a try.  I was expecting low cut tops on the waitresses, but the very tiny bottoms was a bit of a surprise!  There is very little clothing on the wait staff folks.  It's borderline clothing optional.  I might be exaggerating a bit but it was a little shocking.  Being women our service was clearly not as engaged then if we had been men.  The male parties were given a lot of attention whereas they just checked in on us from time to time but didn't stay and chat.  We only had beer so can't really comment on the food.  The patio upstairs is actually really quite nice... And I would probably return again if everywhere else was busy and I needed somewhere to go."}
{"text":"Watch for the charges at this place. They add 4.00 dollars to your bill without informing you that this is for a reported charity. They termed the charge AUGUST CHARITY  and say nothing about it to you. While I was there two other groups and myself complained about it. Who knows where the money goes?  Imagine the extra money they bring in. The food is typical Hooters."}
{"text":"Today was a low point in my thirty years of going to Hooters.    As usual, the food is not bad and no matter which Hooters I went to and I have been to many different states and different countries to eat at Hooters, the food is predictably the same.  However, today was the nadir of my history of eating at Hooters.    Today there was a preseason NFL game on and the volume of the televisions was so loud my ears were ringing because of the high volume.  I could not hear my son speak.  I could not hear the waitress speak.  It was horrible.  The manager came over and told me he could \"dim\" the sound but he had to keep the volume up.  I said why, it was uncomfortably loud.   He said I should have not choose to sit under the speaker on the wall near the ceiling.  I said I choose to leave.  He graciously gave me my food order without charging me after I changed my order to go.    Regardless, if you want to lose your hearing or walk around with your ears buzzing even after you leave the building, this is not a bad place.  For those that are deaf, you should enjoy.  For those that want to preserve their hearing,  I would totally avoid this location.    Try BWW instead."}
{"text":"Okay place in a good location.   The only reason I went here is because of friends. It's in a good location on Mill Avenue, where you can see the bar dramas and street performers.  Typical hooters, except in the buzz in Tempe."}
{"text":"It's a crap shoot at this location. Always short staffed. IF the right cook is in the kitchen your food will be prepared right. And whatever you do, DO NOT allow Mya to be your server. She's horrible. No clue what customer service means. I'm watching all these other servers on their A Game, but Mya needs to be trained better."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends come here once every 2-3 months for a little get together. The service is always so awesome. And the food is delicious. My all time favorite is the deep fried pickles, so good!!!"}
{"text":"Brittany, you are a TERRIBLE waitress. You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.  My friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table.   This blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips.   My friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great.   If you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress."}
{"text":"Good food but I haven't been to one of these in nearly 12 years and was pretty excited to go. Traveled way out of my way to get here and I got the one pregnant waitress. OH COME ON!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to be fans of this chain but after eating at another subpar restaurant we are thinking that we've had enough. In the latest experience we had 4 different servers and the food quality of the wings varied between pretty good to really greasy and undercooked. We honestly had a better experience at hooters in Asia. Kind of sad and definitely disappointing."}
{"text":"The worst! Wings came out in 1 Minute why? Because they were cooked hours ago. Waitstaff as friendly as a rabid grizzly with hemorrhoids and a hang nail."}
{"text":"Horrible service the waiters are ass they see you and don't even get your drink or order !"}
{"text":"It's a hooters... So yea greasy food, cheap beer, tight shirts. Ya dig? Maybe don't bring your girlfriend on the first date. Good place to watch a sports game with pals. Service is friendly, all of the girls are very amicable. Welcome to hooters."}
{"text":"Phenomenal staff. Great food. Makes you feel like family. Great prices and always fun. Awesome locals spot to watch any game or fight in Vegas. Jerod, Timmy, and Donald are very friendly interactive managers and do a great job. Gretchen, Kaysha, Amberlyn, Brooke, Sarah, Latrice, Emily, and Kelsey are by far the best staff this place has going for them on a waitress level. Steve, Jonny, Taylor and Dre will always take care of you at the bar."}
{"text":"Just wanted to comment on a yelp by Randy P on 3/4/16- given that your from Phoenix I understand your complete ignorance of the gaming industry in Las Vegas- that location has an awesome gaming clientele and we go their specifically because bartenders like Jen keep the \"droolers\" as we refer to them like you off of the machines so that people like us who actually pay the bills in these locations can play them-- given the entire tenor or your review I have no doubt that your the type of clown who has to register with local law enforcement every time you move- next time instead of being a \"yelp tough guy\" say something to one of the regulars - and we'll gladly show u the door head first- punk...."}
{"text":"So dissapointed.  I expected the Las Vegas Hooters to be a huge step up, it was not.  Go to ANY other city in the U.S. and you'll have a better experience.  Only visit the Vegas restaurant if you're interested in watching crabby waitresses fight amongst one another and/or with their supervisor.  One extra star because they did refill my drink twice."}
{"text":"Usually I LOVE this bar. However, tonight I went to Hooters as I do often to see my favorite bartender in Vegas, Shannon. She has always been so attentive and made me feel so at home at this bar- more than any other in this neighborhood since I bought my house several years ago here. Her customer service is over the top! But she was not there. When I asked the bartender she replied that she was not here tonight and when I further inquired I was told that she \"Would not be here.\" I find it very disturbing that a bar would let go a bartender that I know is loved by myself and so many other patrons in this area. If Hooters new what was best for them they would BEG this DIAMOND back to their establishment."}
{"text":"As I travel for work, I have been to Hooters all over the country.  It is just one of those places where you know the menu and you always get what you pay for.  This location (Scottsdale) is numero uno!  I have never had bad service here. From the Manager Tony to the best waitresses on the planet.  Lexi, Niya, and Alex have been nothing but AMAZING!!!!!  They have always paid attention to not only myself, but my wife so much that this is fast becoming her favorite Happy Hour Hangout!  The food has always been stellar, and cooked per our request.   Will never stop coming here!  Rock on Hooters!"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday for the ufc fights. It was really busy. My friends and I were told at the door we would have to wait. Understandable. Every table seemed to be full. After waiting a few minutes one of the managers brought out a folding table for extra seating. We were seated right away. A hostess I think her name was Jazmine grabbed us waters right away and was very friendly.    Service was surprisingly fast for how busy it was. Disappointed I missed a couple of the first fights waiting, but understandable for the amount of people there. Our waitress had light brown hair. She was very nice and wasn't impatient with us even though it was busy. We confused her with another girl and she joked about how lots of people ask if they are siblings.   Our food was great. We got Daytona wings, fried pickles and curly fries. Everything was hot and crispy. It's hooters. You can't be mad about cold beer, hot wings and a good fight. We got what we came for. Plus a nice view. There's also a girl who looks just like Natalie Wood. That's enough to check the place out.   Overall just impressed about the great customer service on such a busy night. The managers seemed to be running a nice place."}
{"text":"We were starving and it was near where we were so decided to stop.  Food was okay but people don't really go to Hooters for the money.  I had the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich.  I wish it had been on a regular bun rather than the ciabatta bun it was on.  We enjoyed playing the Buzztime Trivia game they had on and our server did a good job even in training so overall, not too bad."}
{"text":"Thank you Melissa for the great service your cute personality comes a long way ..... Came here from out of town heading back home to Chino Hills, Cali . It was nice to have the manager check on our service  Will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"After 20 years of visiting Hooters ... This restaurant so far the worse experience from the waitress to the managers , so I visit this place they ask me for my ID for the beer \"no problem\" so I give them my Mexico ID  they told me  they can not accept it.. They didn't mentions why . Me Being Mexican American nationality got my attention because I travel a lot and when I go to Mexico and if I show my US ID there is no problem . So imaging when the over 10 millions us citizen  that travel to Mexico each year They told them .. You need a Mexico ID to be served   ...But not worries there is more  besides hooters Peoria Next door in tilt Kilt they had no problem taking my money !"}
{"text":"The place was very busy because of a good PPV was being shown, then all of the sudden the security staff of the place started freaking out for no reason, and started creating the worse imaginable kaos to the point that they turn away a very patient line of people using the police of the city. SHAME ON THEM!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much what you'd expect.  Way overpriced, extremely low quality food served by not-that-bright, fake-baked girls wearing shiny nylons, big puffy socks, and the most unflattering shorts imaginable.  Great if you're a perv from '86, decidedly not great for everyone else."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in there for a quick bite to eat.  I had never been in a hooters before.. We had one waitress come and greet us and then a second waitress a few minutes later to give us our drinks.  The second waitress was very sweet and identified that she just started working there a week ago. Definitely not much to choose from the menu if you are looking for healthy food.  Considering it was a Saturday evening around dinner time, it was fairly dead as far as patrons.  As we were waiting for our food, someone in the back cranked up the TVs so loud that having a decent conversation wasn't happening with out a lot of \"what did you say\".  After what seemed like forever we got one of the appetizers we ordered and I had to ask the waitress to see if they can turn volume down. A manager did come over , not apologize for the volume of the tv but to explain why it was so loud.  He agreed to lower the volume a smidge.  It was a hockey game they put on which no one was watching ?   After almost an hour we finally got our meals, it wasn't busy (maybe 10 people in the restaurant in total) and there really was no excuse for the kitchen staff to take almost an hour to make chicken wings and sliders.  Chicken wings were dry, it was like eating the turkey dinner in National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.  It wasn't until we were almost done our meal that we were asked if we wanted a refill of drinks.  Again I realize the waitress was new so I'll give her a break on service .. Food well how do you screw up deep fried pickles and chicken wings!! I would say if you are in the NE area and want to stop for a bite to eat... Keep driving."}
{"text":"I don't know if the place will last...been here a few times and no one was really eating just sitting at the gaming bar...I heard that is how it stays open in this location.  Fortunately the new manager Owen is taking care of everything and is the best manager this location ever had."}
{"text":"I love this hooters,this is the only place I come to and watch the ufc fights,or sporting events like the superbowl and nfl season...the main reason me and my friends come here is because of anna, jenifer, jasmine, paulina and Stacy ,they have been there since the first time we went and always take care of us no matter how busy it is or how may tables they have they always managed to take care of all our needs...I was there again on saturday 13jun15 for the ufc fight and they did fantastic like always...I recommend you to go here and have any of this girl take care of you and you will have an awesome experience"}
{"text":"Alejandro you shouldn't have to wait 26 minutes to get waited on let alone go get a managers attention because of it  Regardless if servers are new, there is no excuse and for that idiot that agreed it was bad service ...blah blah  Really? Going to tell you servers were arguing over who's table it is? Even so? Shouldn't take 26 minutes to figure that out plus they dropped the ball! !!   Both managers need fired to include the selfish servers, they all are in the wrong business!   Perhaps a funeral home would be more fit for their profession"}
{"text":"My experience here was not good.  We got here at 5pm did not get seated until 5:20pm and there were a lot of tables open.  When we got seated our waitress took our order and then asked for manager for an explanation he kept telling me I don't know and said he got there at 5:15 and just kept saying I don't know.   We planned on eating before cardinal vs raider game and be out of hooters by 6.  But nope still sitting here at 6pm with no food and need refills on drinks and they just informed me they ran out of hot dogs for kids meal.    Another manager came and said some people kids."}
{"text":"Great service where it matters most. I left my iPad Air at the restaurant and after contacting them, the General Manager got my mailing address, confirmed it via email and asked a favor from his girlfriend to ship it out to me (since he has a restaurant to run). I am very grateful for the return of my iPad which I use both for personal and work. In terms of food, I ordered chicken wings and it was really, really good. I was in a hurry and the waitress was very nice about it and made sure that my food was served quickly."}
{"text":"The food was actually very good surprisingly , we got the chicken wings with breaded mix and salt plus a grilled ham and cheese. 4 pints of Canadian for $2.99 each but the place was dead and full of fatties. Maybe they should rename this hooters to fatties because it was dead in there. Mind you it was a Wednesday night!"}
{"text":"The only reason this hooters gets 1star is because my nachos were on point and the ladies looked amazing! I must say I sat at my table for at least 15 minutes before I was given a flat beer. Then I waited another 10 before my order was taken. You would think that the hooters girls would be more friendly expecially how empty this place was for a Friday. Not sure if I will come back dew to the lack of hospitality."}
{"text":"I have been going to Hooters for quite a long time always loved this place always full of energy big smiles happy people but I have to say on this visit I was less than impressed nobody really greeted me I stood at the door for a good two three minutes and then was told to have a seat wherever I choose which was fine just not very inviting not what I'm used to from Hooters I wasn't there for drinks just dinner with my husband he ordered wings of course and I ordered a chicken sandwich I've never seen wings come out so dry before there was hardly any sauce on them we had to ask her an extra side of sauce but of course that's not the same all in all it wasn't horrible just not comparable to what I know"}
{"text":"Never going to any Hooters again. 1) Flat Ass everywhere. Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps!"}
{"text":"Its been years since i came to this hooters.  i used to go here every time i visited my sister in AZ or my friend a ASU.  South Park Wednesdays were the best. 25 cent wings, and south park.  cant go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, with worse food. The only draw is obvious from the name of the restaurant. But that is why we have the internet."}
{"text":"I thought I would try out this location, big mistake. First parking is a nightmare. Second, I sat inside first and went unnoticed for 10 minutes. Then a fight broke out so I moved to the outside bar where there was no bartender. Twenty minutes in I was getting up to leave when waitress finally asked if I wanted a beer, a 3 dollar pbr wasn't bad so I figured why not. I felt completely ignored for 30 minutes,  will never come back. I'm halfway through my pbr and can't wait finish it so I can leave."}
{"text":"Not sure what I expected from staying at Hooters Hotel. Being a fan from California, figured couldn't beat 24/7 wings, not to mention was cheaper to stay here then most other hotels.   Needless to say, room has been fine, no problems. Clean and a place to sleep, clean shower, can't beat the price.   Only complaint is with the late night staff at Hooters Saloon. I'm sure there used to every drunk idiot late at night coming in, but when I sit down, after 12, to a fairly empty saloon, and I only get waited on after having to get the bartenders attention after they have walked past me a good 10+ times and didn't say a thing, for the second time in row at night, Just expected at least a hello, something. I work in the industry, I get it, some nights are harder then others, but 2 nights back to back, different people and same service, just makes you want to leave the hotel and go elsewhere for a drink.   Guess you get what you pay for. Rooms are fine, food is Hooters standard, service, not so much. Drink elsewhere, sleep here I guess."}
{"text":"I come here often cuz it is near Best Buy and Home Depot.  Often wanted 2 comment but haven't til now so this review is kind of an accumulation of my experiences.   The service is always slow @ this location.  The trick is to sit right next to someone else so that the girls can find you, see you, don't have an excuse 2 ignore you , something.   Once noticed, all of the servers here have been pleasant.  It just seems that management needs 2 give more direction regarding who has what table.  I actually like the wings so the atmosphere is a bonus.  That is, I used to like the wings.  This time they came out very \"saucy\", which was unusual, and tasted different.  I guess they changed their menu.  Not sure I'll b back.  As an aside, where do u buy such thin paper towels? Especially if u r now saucing up ur wings, maybe it's time 2 get sum real paper towels!"}
{"text":"Worst service if I could post pictures I would to prove how dead it is and it's taken me an hour to even get my food!! I feel like the mc scuse me bitch lady right now! It took 15 mins to get my damn drinks are you kidding me right now?! Never coming here again, lost a customer and good tipper, I work off commission I'm always more than generous but not tonight!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for business and visited this Hooters on a Sunday night to watch the Cowboys game. First I ordered a beer and the waitress brought me a beer in a plastic cup not in a cold mug or a glass. She said they ran out of mugs! No mugs or glasses WtF. What bar runs out of mugs?   And waiters and serving staff should not eat in front of patrons, and neither should bartenders. The wings were ok."}
{"text":"I actually go for the boneless wings.  The T & A isn't bad either.  The ladies are all friendly & some will sit down to talk with you for a while."}
{"text":"I don't care much for the food at hooters, I had a chicken sandwich and it was horrible. The waitress was nice and pretty, and the beer was good and cold."}
{"text":"I went there tonight to watch the game, it at first seemed like a typical Hooters. The cute little waitress with the leopard print glasses was amazing! That is where it ended, my beer was flat and the food was horrible. It was so bad that we left early so that I could actually cook some good food. The only reason we even paid was because the waitress was amazing. When is Hooters going to fix this place!?"}
{"text":"Food did take a while to come but I'm not complaining. I was watching the game! I go for the seafood every time. It's a no brainier and never disappoints.  Plus my waitress hooked it up! Love hooters!"}
{"text":"Have been there many times. I like their curly fries. However, when it comes to the wings, it's not always consistent. Sometimes the wings are so dry, while other times they are covered with too much sauce. And sometimes they are okay. But it takes a long time for the food to be prepared and served."}
{"text":"I just came out of this place and told that they have to improve the service. They are not realising that how bad they are. When I order draft beer got the bottle beer, curly fries came out of the fridge. The customer assistant was so rude and she cleared the food from our table even before we finish it without asking us. When i asked why are you doing this and she replied that she has to go home. This happened at 8:30pm. We were really shocked by looking at the whole experience. We will not return to this place and never recommend to our friends. Grr."}
{"text":"My husband, friend and I were passing through town and the boys wanted some wings. We have all been to other Hooters before, but this is THE WORST one ever! We walk up and it looks busy which was fine, but having the cops greet us at the door should have been the first red flag. There were several young Hooter girls standing by the front door and one named Kate G was super sweet, put our name on the list, showed us to the bar and checked on us after we ordered our beverages. Sadly the manager Jessie has THE WORST manners of any manager of a restaurant we have EVER encountered!! He was a huge jerk!! We were at the bar ordering our drinks and he told us, \"move! You need to be outside.\" I tried very nicely to explain we just ordered our drinks then we would be more than happy to relocate. He kept telling me over and over to move that I could not stand there (under the sign that says ORDER HERE)! Finally he puffed in my face and walked away. After relocating outside Kate G was super nice and checked on us. While drinking our beverages and observing the operation we decided this place was not organized, the manager was still a jerk to me (saw me walking towards him on my way to the bathroom and nearly ran me into another patron). My husband had a nice conversation with the police and they even told him not to eat here! So we finished our drinks and left. This was the worst Hooters experience ever. The manager Jessie should take an etiquette class, maybe a few times! We give this place an F, except for Kate G."}
{"text":"Those new smokehouse wings are great!! I loved the food! Loved the service! The prices are still really good! Such a great atmosphere! I feel like I should eat there every day on my lunch break! The food and atmosphere just makes you want to come back for more"}
{"text":"There were 8 of us about to celebrate a friends birthday ,we sat there for 15 minutes waiting to be acknowledged and nothing happened , I asked the bartender if they were open he said 24 hours then got back to ignoring us . In the end when we left I asked the waitress why no one wanted to serve us , she looked at us and mumbled something in gibberish . Won't be going back .  This was awful customer service, we went to TBirds instead and was served within a minute ."}
{"text":"The food is still as crappy as it was ten years ago. The service at this new spot lacking since it is full of airheads. I realize that the girls are not selected for high IQ, but I expect them to know when to ask me if I want more or if I want the check. It is a very simple process. I will not return as there are many places that make a much better hot wing for less than one dollar per wing. If you seek cute costumes in a sports bar choose TILTED KILT over this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to watch the UFC fight. The $5 cover was fair and there were lots of  TVs but the food was eh at best. I had a chicken quesadilla, which you would think you couldn't mess up but the chicken in it was awful. Boneless wings were decent but nothing special. Service was alright considering it was a fight night. Just not a big fan of this place. Oh well."}
{"text":"This is first time here and I am not happy at all!! Our waitress is really friendly but made me wait like an hour for my order giving me hope that my order is coming up soon. Then finally, she said they're out of buffalo chicken dip! I was so disappoint!! I did t know who to blame but either way it was so unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Not the best food ever, but prety good overall. I haven't had much here but the cobb salad and appetizers. I did have the deep fried pickles, decent but nowhere near the best I've had. I think it's because they choose to slice them up instead of speaing them.  Regardless the salad has been yum, although what I didn't like is they charge you an extra dollar for more salad dressing. Cheap asses.  Personally I don't find many of them attractive. Maybe they left to work at a job where they would,kt be oogled.  Had a horrible experience last time me and some girlfriends went, the waitress was too busy shaking her booty for the business men there to get our bills right or even check on us. Needless to say she got no tip and a big complaint."}
{"text":"First time ever for my husband and I staying at the hooters hotel, decided to grab a bite here for the first time as well and we loved it. The food quality was great, we didn't have to wait for our food for more than 15 mins meanwhile we ordered mozzarella sticks and enjoyed our beers and watching the basketball game, we waited to get seated but wasn't more than 5-7 minutes. Overall this place was perfect!!"}
{"text":"Good service here.   The new smoked wings are beyond great!  Still crave them everyday.."}
{"text":"Terrible food! Menus and utensils were dirty. Food took forever for an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"To my surprise, the food here was good. The fried pickles and crab legs (yes, we ordered crab legs here!) were standouts. The wings were good, too."}
{"text":"Wings are so disgusting here.. They seem to have old ones and reheat.  Also, some ingnorant waitress we had named Julia very very thin had the nerve to ask my husband if he wanted to hang out with her sometime right in front of me.."}
{"text":"Terrible service, no class, could not handle our party of 20 people. They never brought people's food out, messed up orders, and did zero accommodations for their mess ups. Worst Hooters I've ever been to in 10 years!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service the was received at this Hooters location on W. Trade. Went on Valentines Day around 9:45pm. The restaurant was empty, with ample seating at both bar and dining. Food took over an hour and a half to come out,  and plates came out one at a time and food was extremely under whelming. Fries were old, crust on bread was hard. Another person in my group ordered chips and queso, which wasn't even the first meal to come out. Just horrible horrible experience. Asked for manager several times - noticed he was in the kitchen possibly helping out. Rumor was that their was only two cooks. Will not be returning and will not recommend. This is my second time at this location and both times have not been pleasing."}
{"text":"I went into this location (Downtown Hooters) today in hopes of catching a UFC fight. Before I entered the restaurant I asked the staff if they would be showing the fight. I was assured that I would be able to watch the event. I sat down and ordered a beer, then food. I got about half way through my large beer before I was approached by the manager who explained this particular location was having an issue showing the event. I responded to the manager explaining I had already order a beer and food and I only came in to watch the fight.  At this point it was turning out to be a bad experience, in my head money spent, no fight, times wasted.   She offered to cancel my food order then said she would comp the beer. I figured I'd cancel the food, slam my beer and rush over to a different venue to catch the fight, not bad I guess. Then about two minutes later the manager came back and said the food was already made and if I wanted to stick around that my meal would also be on the house as well as my beer. At this point I had nothing to complain about, free beer and free food. UFC could wait.   I was so impressed with how my experience was turned around that I asked for the bar tender manager's name, I was told it was Deja or Dasia. Yay Deja or Dasia!"}
{"text":"Showed up with 2 girlfriends for the last UFC fights. Walked in and sat at the table our friend was waiting. Punk manager immediately came over and told us we couldn't stay..the place was full....ummmm... no it's not. Finally convinced we were staying and with our friends. We  ordered some mediocre food. When the fights were over there was still a group of people waiting to get in and my friend asked how come the other people were not being allowed in. The manager then yelled and started pointing his finger in my friends face and said he had been more than accommodating, completely lost his cool ranting and raving and we were now being kicked out. This was completely unprovoked and it is obvious he has a screw loose. We of course left with our friends and several others got up and walked out.   Who's in charge here? Not sure if these are franchises...but if I owned this joint he would be gone.   Will never go back to this Hooters."}
{"text":"Horrible service girls are super rude took for ever to sit and get are food the girls must hate working for the mangers or owns of this place I wouldn't even give this hooters a  more like a"}
{"text":"Came into this place on 12/20/15 to catch the raiders vs packers game. Arrived in 3rd quarter with 5 minutes left. It wasn't a very packed night, Nicole was our server. We placed a drink order which took about 20 minutes to receive our drinks, when we asked the waitress she said cups were drying... When we got our drinks we placed an order, 2 wing orders and a burger, we also asked for a tv that Boone was using to be changed to a different channel (never happened),  about 30 minutes later we spoke to the manager. He checked the computer and said our order was put in 8 minutes ago, and we were being impatient, not true, at this point there was under 4 minutes left in the 4th quarter, we asked a customer next to us how long we had been there, he stated himself \"about an hour\". The manager refused to believe it and accused us of being drunk! We payed for our drinks, and walked next door to red lobster! Never returning to this hooters location again!"}
{"text":"Food is nothing close to special, service is decent.  They recently upgraded their beer list which is great. I usually come here for PPV events such as UFC, place does get pretty busy since not many places show UFC PPV events."}
{"text":"Why do people go to Hooters? I've never seen a girl with a decent rack there yet. You would think that would be a requirement of employment given the name of the place, but apparently it isn't. The peanut oil wings make me ill.  If you want to have young hot chicks dressed like tarts serve you greasy bar food then head downstairs to the Library or go to The Tilted Kilt (which actually has pretty decent food)."}
{"text":"Love this Hooters!! Girls and management are as friendly as ever . Great customer service. The short haired blonde girl was awesome & so nice."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, just a little crowded."}
{"text":"WTF??? We went there mi and my wife just for the grupon deal...... What a big mistake!!!! If You're not spending big money the don't give a s.... Funny thing is how those little asian girls profile everybody the may smile for the second to the table but once they turn the  head around totally different face they're just dont make you feel welcome....."}
{"text":"Alexia is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaantastic!  Also.....Kendra is diviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine!"}
{"text":"Met a friend at Hooters Scottsdale Pavilions location, sat at the bar for 20 minutes before being served although we were acknowledged being there after sitting for 10 minutes.  Finally ordered beverages and my drink was wrong.  The bar top where we were sitting was dirty and asked to have it wiped clean of the leftover food and crumbs from the previous patrons.  The waitress working behind the bar was by herself with about 10 customers.  We were ignored having to get her attention for another beverage and order food.  The three to four other waitresses were working tables with three couples only and no help at the bar was offered.  The manager didn't help but wanted to interrupt the bar waitress to show him how she cut limes?  The service was deplorable, the food marginal, and the restaurant was dirty.  The cook was eating food in the kitchen with his bare hands while preparing orders!   Will never frequent the restaurant or any Hooters.  The worst!"}
{"text":"Our server Caryn was quick to take our drink order & friendly too.  20 original pieces of wing w/ranch &  w/curly fries is what we ordered.   Wings were great & hot."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service.Our crew went there last night, the place was kind of empty. The guy behind the bar yelled to us to sit anywhere we like. We Sat out on the patio and no one even came out to greet us. After 15 minutes one of our guys went back inside and asked for service. One of the waitresses came out and had nothing but bad attitude. Then when we got our beers, another 20 mins later. They we're warm. Then when I asked for another beer she told me \" Put it outside for a little while\". The manager had to come out and bring me a new beer.  I love Hooters. I eat at every Hooters in every city that I visit. I've never had service this bad in my life. I will never visit this location again. I wish you could give them -5."}
{"text":"Drinks were cold. Waitress unattentive. Side salad was good except for the dressing. Blue cheese dressing a little thicker than milk and tasteless. Wings were not like I am used to in the states. Much smaller and the heat scale is a bit on the whimpy side. Second drink was cold too :)"}
{"text":"I order the shrimp tacos here, and love me a good shrimp or fish taco. Once they arrived i took one bite and only tasted poor tasting tortilla and cabbage. My second bite was a replay of the first.... no shrimp. I opened my taco and there was only three very small shrimp in my taco.... sad to say all the other tacos were the same. For 12 dollars you would expect more than filler with a scent of shrimp. Talked to the wait staff and this was not a mistake of the cook staff. This is all you will receive in their shrimp tacos at any hooters. I still love thier wings, but only a two star if this is how hooters is trying to get my money by cutting corners on quality and quantity."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night for some good wings. I've been to other Hooters locations before. We saw 3 other parties seated after us and served water and drinks. We flagged down our would be waitress and she said she'd help us but still tended to the other parties first. We waited at least 15 minutes with no water or menus and walked out. The hostess said she'd get a manager but we were just over it. I gave this review 1 star because I HAD to but we didn't even get water so...maybe it was because we had no guys in our party. What can I say..."}
{"text":"I never had a bad experience in this location.  The waitresses and staff are very friendly and always have a good sense on when to check on you when / if you need something.  Food is good (just like every other Hooters) and the environment is welcoming.  If you are a fan of the wings, then wednesday is the day to go."}
{"text":"I had a good time here, the waitress was really friendly and I highly recommend the shrimp, they tasted incredible and the different sauces they brought out with them really brought out the flavour. The layout of the area was nice it felt like a proper sports bar."}
{"text":"This Hooters is near my house so it's always convienient to come here. I love to come in on Wednesdays for Wing Wednesday. I was really bummed to find out they recently discontinued my favorite flavor, Honey Thai.   All the servers that work here are very sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Problem is the service. Rochell was our server server and we saw her only a handful of times. There was a stack of empty glasses that sat on the table the entire time. The empty appetizer plate was still on the table when the food got here. I asked for medium wing sauce twice and never received it. Drinks were 1/4 full half way through and never got refilled. I'm a server and my expectations are to give service like I do."}
{"text":"Worst wings ever! It's second time i make the mistake eating in this location... I don't know how they make it but they are so oily and dry, like is not Hooters. I usually like Hooters but this location really disappoints me. I'll never come back here!"}
{"text":"We are long-time Hooters patrons and this location gets a MINUS 1 star. 9.79 for 4 sliders and 1 of the chicken looks like a Chik Fil A mini (see picture) Sam said she would talk to the manager. Cody the kitchen staff came to look at it and said their food vendor's supply have been inconsistent and some pieces come normal sized and some come small and that it even applies to their wings (good to know). He seemed willing to remedy the issue until Sam came and said the Manager says that we will have to accept the sandwich the way it is. Of course, he was also not willing to tell us himself-he left that for Sam to do...we left before we finished our meal, packed the rest, and decided we'll get better customer service at home..."}
{"text":"OK so my brother and take our clients here sometimes who own construction companies and in the past we had excellent service... Kudos to Ashleh and Erin except on this last occasion during the evening. We brought clients in and one brought his wife and they loved the food and servers EXCEPT the pervert manager justin (I used lower case cause he acted like a a minor who cannot control himself) who kept looking down our \"future client's wife's breast\" this is ridiculous and to top it off he hit on her! Well this upset the husband and they will never go back to any hooters nor will we and we generate ALOT of business for the owner of this location!   FYI if he does this to customers who are married imagine what he does during business hours. If the owner wants to speak to our company he can BUT we will NOT take this review down. I debated about giving it a five star based on the previous servers; however, this manager needs to be reviewed on his conduct and probably more. I have been in business for 20 years and never witnessed this BEHAVIOR to a customer and then in front of the spouse? He is a walking liability."}
{"text":"Met friends here before going to spring training game.  Beer was good and cold.  Our server was good as well.  The food here is pretty much the same as any Hooters and not a favorite of mine.  Anymore I will pretty much order the same thing, wings, cajun style, naked.  The breaded one's are just too much breading.  Another friend ordered loaded tater tots and they came glopped with sour cream and cheese sauce...yuck...unless you've already had numerous adult beverages, then they might be OK! Anyways, it's better then the Buffalo Wild Wings across the street and there really aren't too many options out by Salt River Field. (the food is better at the ballpark, btw)."}
{"text":"Chicken cooked at wrong temperature... Was completely red. Threw up for 3-4 straight days. Lost business over it too. Fix the kitchen, fix the restaurant... STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"That's right we're not tipping you, maybe if you had some posture, and weren't sitting on your ass when we came to the door, and maybe if you season your shrimp, and maybe if you didn't charge us double, and maybe if you were more interested in service rather than selling alcohol, and I've seen more menu items in the restroom is in-n-out burger. So why don't you write the zeros on the top line."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday and got to sit and wait for 20 minutes and the closest I got to service was when the waitress came to the table beside me , picked up the tip that was left on the table and walked away leaving both a dirty table and me. I walked"}
{"text":"Went to this place after a convention nearby. 2 of 3 orders were incorrect and the amount on our check was wrong. Didn't even finish our food. They seemed nice but well understaffed or not managed very efficiently. I would pass on this place unless you are really hungry or need to watch some sports and have a beer."}
{"text":"The location is what pulled us in.  Late night, near the Mission Palms Hotel where else to go. Acually lots of places because this neighborhood has action.  OK,  we're a group of 4.  Thursday night they had any alcoholic beverage for $3.50.  Hope that one continues, it was a real value.  Of course, the wings were good as usual. The waitress was a good sport and posed for pictures for us ding-bat tourists.  I figured she did it for the tip, and she got a good one.  But she was nice when she didn't have to be so accomodating. Give 'em a plus for that. Oh yeah, it's on the second floor."}
{"text":"Never really been a fan of the food here...and after this visit...i'm still not a fan.  The wings there suck, the beer is over-priced and now most of the girls are not even hot anymore.  Additionally it didn't help that our server was new and didn't smile or look happy to be there at all.  We pretty much had to beg her to smile at least a little.  Don't think i'll be going to a Hooters again for a while, For an overpriced beer and hot girls I prefer going to a place like Tilted Kilt where at least the food is good."}
{"text":"Views are good but the hooters in Barry is better. Too uptight too covered too conservative Toronto. Food is adequate but expensive for what you get. But then you don't come for the food do ya? Stop by for drinks skip the food."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waited 30 min then we were finally asked if we have been served. The waitress was decent. Had to wait 30 min just to wait for each batch of wings. As a matter a fact we received a set of wings that was cold....then! Then! We ordered fries that came out almost 30-40 min later from our first order of wings . We even had a group that sat in 15 min after us and received there drinks and food and ended up leaving before we got our second plate of wings...the best that came out of it is that we got our fries on the house. All in all still disappointed. Hopefully new management and/or workers are in thought."}
{"text":"Good afternoon,  Been to Vegas for my second time and got a chance to grab a late lunch at Hooters. I would not have seen us eating at Hooters especially being in a place with so many options but it was GREAT! Our waitress was Erika who was awesome, came by every couple of minutes and made sure we knew all of the options on the menu and provided a beer recommendation. We had so many choices but it was late and we gave Hooters a chance which really paid off. Go to Hooters and get Erika if you can."}
{"text":"If you're a real man, you're going to Hooters for one reason and one reason alone - Monday night wing night. I'm kidding, it's the shorts.   Don't get me wrong, I love a nice set, but the surely man-designed staff uniforms are clearly meant to feature the bottom, more than the top. Call me a typical guy, but I really do enjoy looking at a bit of bum hanging out the bottom of a uni-aged girl's shorts.   As for the food, the wing are actually pretty good. As goes the theme here, bigger is better and the wings are certainly big. If you go for the all-you-can-eat deal on Monday you'll be treated to a huge first portion of wings followed (long after) by a ridiculously small portion of wings. You'll get all the wings you can eat, just over a long period of time. They want you to drink.   Other than the wings, I seem to recall everything being pretty good, either because of or despite the ridiculous amount of grease.   I like the Adelaide location because of the roof-top patio and the fact that one of the servers looks like Chicken Parm Phil's cute sister (his words, not mine)."}
{"text":"My friends and I really, really enjoy this Hooters. The food is always fresh and crisp. The manager and all the girls that work here are so nice, friendly and attentive. By far my favorite Hooters."}
{"text":"11 of us went to Hooters for lunch on National Chicken Wing Day on July 29, 2016. The Hooters website advertised all you can eat chicken wings on that day.  When we arrived to the location we were informed that franchise stores such as this one do not participate in the all you can eat promotion.  What a major let down, not to mention the false advertising on their website.  All of us are in the marketing industry and there was no fine print in the website ad explaining exclusions.  We were duped. Instead of all you can eat wings they offered 10 wings and a beer for $12.99 - hardly a deal.  And the beer had to be draft Bud, Bud Light or Michelob Ultra. Based on this unpleasant experience my group has one less place to eat downtown, as we won't be going back to Hooters."}
{"text":"Delivery was fairly quick and the quality of food was consistent with what you get dinning in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Showed up after a concert, an hour before closing time and the manager refused to sit anyone.  It was not even half full when we showed up and even with all the people we saw turned away, they still would not have been filled up."}
{"text":"6/29/17 Extremely poorly managed, very poor service, mediocre food and dirty environment. A single order of food took over 35 minutes to arrive, when it did arrive it was already cold. After the food arrived I ordered a glass of water and a beer. The server never returned so after 25 minutes I went to the bar to get my own glass of water and beer. There were four servers, a manager, a bartender, and eight patrons on the floor in the entire place and still The service was Nonexistent or poor at best."}
{"text":"Shanice is fantastic, kind, professional and just super awesome. The service from her made us smile and feel like important customers, this is how we should always feel. Management was also excellent as he came and greeted everyone and ask how our meal was m. Great great great!!! Ohhh by the way the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now all I can say is that the service keeps getting worse n worse each time.   Don't get me wrong, love their wings n that's the only reason I keep coming. Waitresses take way too long to come to the table, they get u the wrong order n push u to check out cz their shift is ending..."}
{"text":"This is the best hooters, ever. The manager is awesome. He always takes care of you, and the service is always great. The food isn't always equally as great, but the staff more than makes up for that!"}
{"text":"3 start because the new menu is very good ! but the service it is not good like use to be . need hire more server ! they all disappear from the dining area. hope you guys resolve  this matter! i will be back"}
{"text":"Weak ass food... fries were cold. I usually love there wings but they sucked. Native wings are better."}
{"text":"This review is based on my last visit. I left my wallet and cell phone in the washroom for 20 minutes. I went back and they were gone. I asked the manager and server if anything was returned. Their response was, \"No\", which was fine but when I asked more questions (cameras seeing who would have gone into the washroom area, etc) the staff was not offering ANY help. I'm pretty sure the person who took these was a regular (he was in the washroom shortly after me).  This is how Hooters treats patrons who need help. I wouldn't go back if there was a policy stating that servers go topless.   Oh, the food is OK at best but priced higher than that. The beer is your typical Molson, Corona, etc (nothing special)."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. This place is awful.  The service. The cleanliness. The food.  It's just ridiculous. The first time I went to this location we sat there for 20 minutes, with not even one person asking if we need drinks. We had to keep asking over and over again who would serve us. They kept saying they have to find someone for our \"section\" yet right next to us, behind us, in front of us there were full tables...get this....with servers. Even a couple sat next to us and they got drinks and food before we did. Like wtf. Eventually we got assigned multiple waitress, but probably 30 minutes later!!!  Now yesterday. It happened again. They didn't know who was assigned our table. Why even seat us? There were many open tables. After talking to many servers, because we were next to their POS station, finally we got a hostess to help us. Yet. She didn't. She didn't know what beers were on happy hour. She didn't know if they had Kilt Lifter. She didn't even know about \"The Beer of the Month\" she told us she couldn't serve us because she was a minor. Which is understandable but when the whole table wants beer there is no reason for her to help us out. She kept laughing at our frustration. So we left. Because there was no way we would wait and be patient like the first time we visited. What's even more upsetting is reading the reviews and seeing how many stars this place has, yet no improvement is being made.  Way to go Hooters. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Nice little divey joint. Reminds me of the whole hot wings and beer experience in the 90s. 2nd best wings in Vegas with the first being Chicken Shack on Green Valley and Sunset -- There wings are pricey though. I paid $14 for 10 wings and other places have 9 wings for $7.50"}
{"text":"Myself and a group of 6 others went for all you can eat wings (Monday night special). It was our first time at this location. No one greeted us when we (only 4 of us at this point) entered. Finally a girl told us in passing \"yall can sit here\" and pointed to the table right in front of the door. We asked for a bigger table because more people would be joining us. She told us that there were not enough waitresses to take on one of the bigger tables in the back section. My fiancé said \"I guess the rest of us will just sit on the floor.\" Our waitress laughed and walked away.  *mind you, there were 5 waitresses tending all of 12 tables. When I was a waitress, servers were assigned 4-5 tables EACH... Maybe the low intelligence of hooters girls makes this impossible. But I digress* The rest of our party arrived and we squeezed them all into the table we were seated at. We ordered a pitcher of beer and a round of shots. It took 20min before all of that was on the table. She messed up 3 out of 6 shots (and charged us for her mistakes at the end of the night), and getting the correct drinks took another 10min.  When we tried to flag her down to order food (RAVENOUS at this point, almost an hour into sitting at this table), she held up her hand and told us \"hold on\", not stopping to even look our way. One of our group got his first round of wings 15min before the rest of us. When we finally got our first round, it was half wrong. Surprise surprise. We tried to put our second order in, but she was so rude we found the \"manager\", If you could call anyone so low class and unprofessional a manager. She cut us off in the middle of our explanation, rolling her eyes, and told us she could give us the GM's number and we could take it up with him. Hello, we just want the drinks we ordered and more than 4 half cold God damn wings for $13...  This place is a joke. I'll save you from the rest of the experience. I usually give people the benefit of the doubt and I would say that if someone came in and really gave this team of people a speech on being a team, being courteous and attentive, and helped them build up their confidence as capable waitresses that it could be a totally different place... But no. I can't even say that of this place."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience... Service was very slow and our server \"Destenee\" had an attitude. We went with a group of 6, the wait for our table was a little long but expected since we went on a Saturday night. I ordered the Buffalo shrimp, as I always do when I visit any hooters. My shrimp barely had any sauce on them, I showed them to our server and asked if she could bring a side of sauce. Well,  she brought the sauce and she also charged extra... For sauce that should have already been on the shrimp to begin with! We waited another 15 minutes after our server brought our checks to the table for her to come back and collect our money. Really..."}
{"text":"New Hooters location off I-215 & South Rainbow which opened the end of October. 24hr gaming and live entertainment!  Came here to meet with a group of my friends to watch the football game \"Steelers vs. Broncos\" whooo! Go Steelers! I am a Chargers fan, so normally I wouldn't praise Steelers as much, but I wanted Denver to lose. (no offense to bronco fans)   The Hooters girls that worked there were actually ATTRACTIVE.  than other Hooters I've been to. Whoops! Did I just say that :x  Its true.   Besides the looks, the service was fast and friendly. Rachel, our server, was super! Always came to our table to make sure we were okay or needed anything else. She was on top of her game even when there was a full house. Also, we were in a group of 10+ and she separated our tabs for us. Thanks Rachel! +++  Best new hooters spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We decided to hit up Hooters before a concert, and was pleasantly surprised, even though they have a reputation for their servers, the food is quite good. I had the burger with a side of fries and a salad, and they serve their burgers on  toast, which is quite unique and offers up something different. Our waitress was quite nice and the service was very good. They also carry Guinness on tap, which is great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife and service was terrible at best. No greeting at the door,no goodbye. .  Started with us waiting forever for wings and a Cobb salad. Tiana walked by us was rude. It's like no one there wanted to help each other. Do not let her assist you. She's rude.  Also we were eventually helped by another server. However her excuse was lame. First she blamed  the kitchen then said the servers were new.  Not true.  Then after all was said and done she said she told her manager about our bad experience. ...he never came to us.  And I am a combat veteran .so my discount was not applied. Until I Asked . Keep in mind we are regulars. I spent 24 bucks and my discount was a measly 1.30.really?? I won't be back unless Tiffany is there. She's a close friend.and knows how to treat people. They need to hire more tiffany like people. Until then we will not be back.   ."}
{"text":"Dinker wings. One paddle was about 1.5 inches long.  I should've taken a photo. Daytona style had good flavor or else I would've given ONE star here. I'm supposed to forgive that and leave hungry (yes I was still hungry) because I have them served to me by big tits?  I felt like a royal CHUMP. Good freakin' BYE."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 of the orders were incorrect for our group. One person waited an hour for his order to even show up, by then everyone else had already eaten. We were leaving after an hour so canceled the order. Not 1 apology. Even had the guts to charge us for sauce $1. Serious? No manger presence. No staff support."}
{"text":"Nasty says it all!  Our wings were gross, and had the texture of jello! How can you mess up wings when it's your signature item? We also were shocked to find out you charge for ranch dressing, when of course people want ranch, it may be petty that I'm bringing it up, but it shows how greedy this company is.  When a place does something like this, it makes me not want to support them, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to notice how silly this feels. It's the principal, and it's just wrong.  Maybe they'll start charging  for toilet paper in the restroom, and ice in their sodas...  The floor was sticky, tables were dirty, both wet and had crumbs on it, and the place was near empty. Obviously looking at the other reviews here, we know why.   Rather than just let this review stack up with a bunch of other bad ones, why don't you guys actually take the feedback and use it to your advantage, and improve this restaurant?  Kind regards, a wing lover, who didn't even like your wings."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. When I came in no one was up front. After 3 mins or so someone finally came up to us and told us they will come back and seat us. From there she proceeded to go around to here other tables to get them drinks and take their orders. So after 10 mins or standing there we decided to leave.  Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Love the open door feel - so unique in Las Vegas with pitch black dark bars being the norm. Almost feels like your out of down- heaters even added to the patio. Awesome place to enjoy this 70 degree weather that's lasted all the way thru November!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, this particular location provides a decent dining experience. I haven't gotten a chance to get to know many of the waitresses, however, Ashlegh was my waitress my first time in and was everything I could ask for. Super sweet, very attentive to details and open for conversation. Even under the stress of working Wednesday Wing nights does she maintain such a professional and welcoming demeanor. I can recommend for a great experience so long as you have Ashlegh by your side."}
{"text":"Ladies are police and attending making sure your taken care of, I'm just here for Togo food and they are all political and we'll angered ladies I appreciate they are swell and understanding, I love hooters chicken wings they are the best old fashion and Delicious. This place is extremely large and have more televisions then I've seen at a bar if you need to watch a game....they have you covered, I don't drink beer so I cannot say how the beer is but I bet you can always get a cold on here from the ladies that bring you great wings!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The beer is cold.  The women in there are GORGEOUS.  I would give it a 5 but  I feel their food prices are a tad high and the wait time for getting the food is long.  But other than that WHO CAAAARRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS.  Enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Went there to watch football playoff games with 6 people. Ordered over 60 wings and drinks. Less than half way through the game asked to leave because they were gonna show the UFC fight and charged people to see it. We don't watch or care about UFC. Their were no signs no one told us. We were forced to eat quickly and leave. Horrible customer service. Gave 2 stars because our waitress was nice. But food not all that good either."}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous times. Always walked in and Sat at the bar. Congrats on booking a party that took up the entire side of the bar and patio, lovely set up. I sat on the other side of the bar, empty. A few beer mugs were there and more than a few servers, and a manager looked right at me. Finally after 5 minutes a server asked me if a hostess had Sat me. I explained that all I needed was a beer. I now know that your staff is unable to open a tab, pour a beer, close the tab and that with many people available on the floor, including a manager, this task is beyond the call of a wing bar on a pleasant fall afternoon. I would imagine that you will have some very interesting justifications for what happened and why. Just know that after a lifetime in the food and beverage business, none of them will suffice."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars. Seat yourself so we sat ourselves on the bar side in a booth. Waited and waited and was never greeted. Husband finally ask the bartender where a server was and she seemed like she didn't want to take care of us so she says something to a manager. A short female African American manager approaches us and states there is no server on that side so sit on the other side or at the bar and rudely walks away. No thanks. If it's not seat yourself, clearly get a hostess . Will never return. A call to corporate is needed!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. We were waiting for an extremely long time before  someone finally came and asked if we wanted water. They were not even that busy also. We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service! Came here for a birthday lunch with the staff and the server took 50mins to get our order for wings! Are you kidding me! The restaurant was literally empty and there were 4 server on the bar area, what I don't understand is why the hell was there only one server on floor! Overall do not bother for this place unless you have unlimited  hours for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is great! I know it's Hooters however it is the BIGGEST HOOTERS ever. I sat with this crew almost all day handling some business and waiting on a flight to come in. Jennifer took care of me first. I had to have some wings I had at this Hooters in February, Honey Thai..... mmmmmm. This flavor I have found only here. The manager Jared was great he made sure the staff was taking care of me and even took my order when I came in. Next shift I got Lauren at the bar and she was amazing, super sweet and helpful. She was very attentive. Alicia came over to check on me a few times and we had an awesome conversation even while she was caring for her other patrons. You wouldn't expect a Hooters to be so friendly and helpful. The staff was amazing and I had hopes to go hang out with them again but Vegas suckered me in. Since I didn't get to return I wanted to let everyone know what a great day I had just going to get some Honey Thai wings."}
{"text":"Was there for the super bowl and the server was amazing but was never told I had to pay for my sauce ranch blue cheese. I had asked to talk to the manager about the bill and he walked up saying your going to pay for the sauce or I'll call the cops first thing out of his mouth. Then I went to leave and he came outside talking crazy and said Broncos suck and was getting all I rate. Finally the black manage had to tell the white manager to go back inside the one that I had the issue with. None the less he is a very unprofessional manager and should not work In a restaurant I will never go back . He is rude and the black guy is nice the white guy just trash you should be ashamed to have him as your management team. FIRST WORD IM GOING TO CALL THE COPS FOR NOT WANTING TO PAY FOR SAUCE. White boy white short hair and a little beard going on skinny and to chase me out of the bar wow how sad. Figure it out or I will call all my friends and tell them what happen want a call back."}
{"text":"this place sucks,do not go here , the service is awful, the waiters are so full of themselves that it's heartbreaking,went in with my wife ,ordered two beers and some shrimp,it took almost an hour to get the shrimp ,and 20 minutes to get our beers,DO NOT GO HERE,DO NOT GO HERE ,DO NOT GO HERE,DO NOT GO HERE ,DO NOT GO HERE,DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I've ever had in my life. She had zero personality.  I genuinely tried hard to get her to engage.  I feel bad for the restaurant if they have staff like this. Drink was empty,  after waiting forever for her to come back she brought us a ticket instead of offering a refill for my vodka. Messed our bill up so badly, we had 4 things on our ticket that weren't apart of our tab. I paid it and left. I rather pay it then have to hear \"ok\" out of her mouth one more time. Oh, my favorite part of our dinner was watching her in the kitchen running her fingers through her hair looking at her reflection.  Goodbye mesa Hooters, I'll stick to Mill, they have better food/service."}
{"text":"So-so food but service from the strangest duo of waitresses I've encountered. \"Strange\" here meaning \"bad\" and \"off-putting.\"  I'll not be back at this location; the experience was too odd to return."}
{"text":"To go for some wings.  It was bunt and wings were too light taste because sauce was not saturated.    Service was very good. Casher was so nice.  I will not go for food. BBw and pts have much better wings at same price."}
{"text":"Hamburger was tasty.. Beer was ice cold. The staff all very nice!  Haven't been here year's.. Probably won't be back for a few more years. Just stopped in for a beer after perfect golf day. I approve this message JK KUHL..."}
{"text":"This is a franchise Hooters owned by a local couple, so if you choose this Hooters you are supporting locals.  Like.  The staff is much more down-to-earth than most Hooters, and there are males as well as females.  Management always stops by to check on your level of happiness.  My favorite detail is that the room is split in half by a partial wall, with smoking/video poker on one side and non-smoking, no gaming on the other--there's also a patio.  It's always good when everyone can get the environment they seek.  As for us  vegetarians, we're stuck with fries, fried pickles (YUM!!) and salad.  I would love to see a veggie burger or Gardien Buffalo Sandwich on the menu someday."}
{"text":"There is a good laid back vibe here and the waitresses are nice but that is it. I couldn't believe how mediocre the \"world famous\" chicken wings are here. Not good at all. No desire to return due to food that is hard to tolerate."}
{"text":"If you're coming to watch a UFC fight get there before 4pm so you're not charged the cover. Otherwise if you come anytime after 6pm you will be charged $5 unless it's a free showing on FX.  Ask for your check early on these days as it will take awhile. Last time I was there it took about 20 minutes to get the check & another 10 to get it back. Every visit I've had the service is slower than it should be, but because of the fight I realize this.   My recommendation is to sit at the bar. You can get full service of food & drink just as you could in a booth. The bartenders are on top of their game at this location, where as the servers not so much.  The food is average, nothing to write home about, but this location has a great view"}
{"text":"they need to shut this place down and open a wendys or something....came thursday night, nearly empty, came with 6 other people, waitress got everyones order wrong except mine...friends ordered boneless wings and came bone in they were too lazy to say anything, i asked her if she could take it back and get boneless she said its the same thing as boneless just with the bone.....FAIL"}
{"text":"Pros: good location.  Nice outdoor upstairs patio. Good service.  Cons: the walk from the steps below to the restaurant upstairs smelled like a grease trap. Very bad odor. The smell continued throughout the restaurant. Very unappetizing. Wings were dry and food overall is mediocre.  I realize it's bar food, but there is good bar food and bad bar food.  Bathroom was not clean. Mismatched faucets and they were leaking! Looks like the owners need to put some money into this place to bring it back up to par."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service (more like NO service) we sat for over 15 minute and never once did anyone come help us-the restaurant had only 4 tables occupied and one person sitting at the bar, so it not like they were super busy!! To make it even worse the manager was chitchatting with another table and so was our waitress (who walked by us several times). Never did she come by to even get our drink order! Never again!!!!! Management and waitresses (besides the sweet hostess) needs to be changed!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty chill. Nothing upscale about it but the rooms were okay and the casino awesome. Came here last min and I booked a 2 queen beach view room for 84 bucks on a Friday night. The price was very reasonable considering that I booked the room as soon as I got Vegas. Yea I know talk about a last minute booking. The room was clean and according to las Vegas...ishhh. standard. The only complaint is the AC. They really need to invest some money On their ACs. It was pretty bad. I was sweating when I woke up and the AC was blasting? The water pressure also needs to get looked at. I shared the room with 4 ppl and after doing my business I had to flush at least 5 times for my stuff the completely disappear. Talk about an embarrassing moment. Hopefully next time I visit and decided to stay at Hooters I don't come across the same issues."}
{"text":"This is a massive Hooters location. Located in the Palms and adjacent to their pool area. I've stopped in several times and even had it pool side. It's your standard Hooters food and drink, but this location has a ton of TV's to watch football.  Definitely on the top end of their chain."}
{"text":"Wings are pretty great. Service is okay but the waitresses disturbingly (I saw three girls do this) flirt with the fat old men who grab their lower backs and asses and bring them Starbucks while sitting in their section! Our waitress even sat down with them while we were still eating and drinking. The strawberry daiquiri is delicious and the wait staff is sweet. Buff chicken dip is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here when you're drunk. They assume you are and will short change you. Oh, service here suck too. They won't wait on you.  And don't bother for a manager, she just walks around trying to look cool."}
{"text":"This Hooters definitely improved after the remodeling, and it is a good place for simple to grab a sandwich, beer. and/or wings served by hotties in bikinis while watching a game on the multiple TVs.  I know that Hooters is supposed be famous for its wings as well as its female servers with big boobs, but I've never been very impressed with the wings.  The boobs on the other hand.... well, you know! HOOTY-WHO! ;-)"}
{"text":"Hooters is one of those places you're always guaranteed to have a great time at. Between the environment, food, and fabulous Hooters girls I know I can always count on a good time when I go here. I've been to many Hooters in different states and countries and the staff at the Mesa Hooters are fun, knowledgable, and great girls. I recommend bringing all your friends and family here for an experience you won't be disappointed with."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and tastes awesome as always. We ordered 10 pieces of Daytona beach style & 10 pieces of BBQ chicken first, but we were so hungry so decided to order additional 10 piece of Daytona beach style chicken. Order came out very fast. The server Ashley was superb!! Keep up the good job, Ashley!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on 5-16-17 and the place was filthy. The orange seats in our booth were black. We should have left then but didn't.  We ordered food after waiting for 20 minutes just for our drinks. Our server was named Rachel and she couldn't even smile at us. Two other girls were working and there was only two other people in the whole restaurant so it wasn't like it was busy. My wifes fries were cold and soggy . My beer was empty for the rest of our stay. I wanted another beer but Rachel was to busy talking with her co workers. An hour into our meal a guy came out of the kitchen and asked how our food was. I asked for some new fries for my wife and he did. ( this was or only good part of our visit) my wife had to ask him for another shirley temple while or server Rachel just chit chatted . Not once did she check on us or see if everything was ok. Very disappointed in our visit. We will not be back to this establishment.  What a waste of money and time! I should have listened to my wife and gone across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"We went to the downtown Phoenix location last Monday. When we showed the manager bloody chicken, he said mistakes happen. As we walked out he said we have insurance if you get sick. His whole attitude was an embarrassment to hooters. We did get sick, had to take the day off work. We called the manager and he just berated us for not going to the hospital. Well we knew what to do because we're adults. He said he would file a claim but nothing. We shouldn't have had to take a day off because of his mistake. Additionally his whole lack of concern and completely horrible attitude makes all of hooters look bad!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to come to this restaurant, as I've been a fan of \"Hooters\" for many years, and they were just around the corner from \"The Luxor\", where I stayed for four nights. I had wings twice during my visit. The service and the bartenders are the best! I tried the original wings 3 mile island style as well as the naked wings with the Daytona sauce, and I believe I like the Daytona style the best. Both were great, and I really loved coming here."}
{"text":"Hooters is pretty classic. This is the only one in Madison. Enjoyable for sure with delicious fried chicken wings.   There isn't anything neccessarily unique about this location. There is a classic wooden interior with high tables and booths and a bar in the center. Alcohol and food selections are uniform with the rest if the Hooters restaurants.  The service here seems to be the biggest drag, with food delivery taking more time than average as my the number one issue. Wait staff are mostly attentive and polite but more frequent than average, a slacker may make the dining experience unenjoyable, leading to, for example, unrefilled drinks."}
{"text":"Its just sad to see such a great dynasty be thrown in the garbage like they once were at the peak of the customer service chain and now they are terrible. I have seen better service at MacDonalds with a bunch of loud poorly trained high school students. I gave this place two star because of Titus because I was personally disappointed if he didn't help me I think I would never come back"}
{"text":"Food was okay, not the greatest I've ever had that's for sure. And our server was nonexistent. I know sometimes that being in hospitality you deal with certain types of groups, (annoying, drunk, etc+) but the place was empty and we still had horrible service. I definitely won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"Just finished our meal and lets just just it was our experience yet... we ordered 20 piece boneless wings and they brought us regular wings.   We were already done with are fries before we finally got our fixed order of wings.  Then they tried to say they comped us our wings..... um no they charged us for both set of wings and then just took off one order of wings and so the bill was still the same as it normally would of been.   And it took forever to order even though it was super slow.  This is usually are first stop when in vegas but it won't be anymore."}
{"text":"For a long time, there were two restaurants I swore up and down that I'd never visit even once - Crocodile Rock (a.k.a. cougar central) and Hooters. I violated the first instance years ago, when I got roped into visiting one with a woman who worked next to one. I told myself that I would still be good and never go to a Hooters.  I am a weak-willed man.  Having gone down to the city to see John Wick 2 with a group of friends, we discovered that our usual hangout (the Boston Pizza at Front Street and Blue Jays Way) was closed for renovations. Faced with few immediate options and needing to hurry to catch a UFC fight, everyone decided to go to Hooters. And I wish to God we didn't.  The food is... painfully mediocre. Nothing particularly good or outstanding about it. I ended up ordering a plate of fries because I wasn't very hungry, but my friends ordered burgers and wings, half of which was left uneaten for the rest of the night. The one wing I tried was caked in bland sauce.  I tried to look at this \"restaurant\" from a sociological perspective. What was worth noting in this place? The ambience is gruff and loud. Speakers are cranked up to near-maximum, so you have to shout if you want to hear each other. Staff members loudly barge through doors without any regard for customer comfort or safety. Half the servers walk around with doe-eyed expressions on their faces as they try to figure out what to do or where to go. The smart servers (a.k.a. the ones who have been there long enough) seem to take a sort of hidden pride in seeing how many extra entrees and apps they can wring out of men while the latter gawks at their skimpy clothing. When you wear shorts that are so tight that people can see your maxi-pad popping out, you know you've gone too far.  The only way I could see people coming here is if they were desperate to find a restaurant like we were, or if they had low self-morals. With so many other choices in the nearby areas, it is simply not worth the time or effort to seek this place out."}
{"text":"Hey, it's Hooters, not fine dining. But I had a good burger, a stiff drink and a good time. Me and a few guys sat at the bar. The bartender was beautiful, attentive, and friendly."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick dinner yesterday as every other restaurants nearby had lineups. There was the TIFF event and a Jays game downtown, yet this place had less than 5 tables being served. The chicken was super overcooked and small. The caesar salad was drenched in salad dressing and looked unappealing. The curly fries were not fresh and overcooked as well. Would definitely not return to this location."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, food was surprisingly good. I have been less that impressed at other Hooters but this was a nice experience after a long tiring day of travel."}
{"text":"Great service and the fish and chips were great. Our server was on top of it and very attentive! Will come back for sure Julia was great !!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Hooters today was less than mediocre. We waited 25 minutes before a server came over to tell us \"it will be a few more minutes\" we had to go over to a random table and ask them to use their menus because we never got any. After 30 mins we got our drinks and then after another 30 mins we got our food. Well not all of us. There were 7 girls at our table and only 5 ordered food- wings and onion rings (doesn't take long in the deep fryer). We were missing a platter and a plate of onion rings- which came another 30 mins later. At this point we asked to see a manager- who honestly did not care at all that we were waiting for this long and that we were basically ignored the whole night. The manager said \"sorry she's kinda new - we can take the platter off the bill and can I make anything else faster for you?\" Well no - that was the last of food and drinks and we had 3 servers at the table how were they all new? he just said \"ok\".  We were a table full of servers so we get it's busy sometimes   BUT WORST SERVICE EVER. Not even great \"hooters\" could have fixed this experience. 0.5 star."}
{"text":"Good service, decent food. Cigarette smoke wafts into the restaurant if they seat you in the area close to the casino floor as there is no wall to keep the smoke out. The restaurant is much better than the disgusting hotel, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Worst customer Service EVER! This was not the first time we had horrible service here, decided to give it one more chance..  Big mistake! Me and another female waited over 30minutes for a waitress to come by. But when 2 men sat at tables near us they were served within 5 minutes.    When we spoke to JUSTIN the manager he said he didn't believe we waited that long and asked why WE didn't go get a waitress? It was a slap in the face to be called a liar!!  I posted on FB and there were a few more people that received horrible service.  BUFFALO WILD WINGS across the street has great service all the time, go there instead."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever ! Sat for over an hour after ordering with no concern from management. Asked for the bill for drinks and had no remorse from the manager . Horrible customer service ! I own my own business and would have no clients with service or the lack of , experienced here."}
{"text":"Well been here many time with boys for some all you can eat wings and some drinks.   The place is great!  Food: for the given price the wings are decent!  Service: is quite good as they have you seat quick and food/ drinks come in a decent time.  Price: prince point is decent for the quality of food they provide.  Parking: plenty of parking in the plaza its located in.  Entertainment: lot of tvs and different games are on all the time.  Servers: are very friendly and looks like they are enjoying work, which makes the service good.  Patio: I love their patio as its near the airport and you can see the planes flying by you really close.   Seating: Lot of seating inside and on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was eh and the servers were rude. Went with my boyfriend and the waitress assumed we weren't together and brought out 2 checks... that was a first."}
{"text":"Yup... it's a Hooters alright! Okay, lets start by saying: it is what it is! It's a Hooters... decent food served by women with big boobs and tight booty shorts, add some beer and I'M GAME! This place is a bit small compared to other Hooters I've been to but the service was really friendly and quick. I probably would've liked the food better if I was drinking more but I had to go to work afterwords. I feel like their food is great when I'm drunk and NOT when I'm... well... NOT! Definitely a good spot to watch the game, get in a few drinks, and chow on some grub."}
{"text":"Our stay at hooters was okay. While I don't have anything \"wow\" to say about the hotel I do appreciate them having free wifi. However there were several things that I was not okay with and were deal breakers in me visiting this hotel again.  There was no sign available to hang at the door and when I asked a housekeeping lady for one she reply that she didn't have one. Our room was not cleaned the first night which I honestly didn't care much except we needed new towels.  But the two things that bothered me the most is that staff opened the doors TWICE without knocking and we had to scream that we were in there. The first time I think it was housekeeping it was around 9am, but I couldn't check. The second time I called because the hair dryer did not work, I called main desk and they said they would send me another one which I was okay with but instead a maintiqnce guy came in without knocking to \"fix\" the dryer. I ended up putting my hair up and before I left the maintiance man said he would have to replace it."}
{"text":"This is the best location. The GM Lefty and his managers Jarrad and Owen are trip notch, he epitome of hospitality. My server Ria is an angel, the sweetest warmest person and my bartender Heather is personality time 1000 and literal sunshine. I love this location. Thank you"}
{"text":"Horrible service, cute waitresses but they have no brains. Food for half the table never arrived. Will not come back ever....poor management...just all around bad."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, and great service, everything you can expect from any hooters."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Hooter's. We were there 2 hours had to ask for the 1 drink refill I received. Took over an hour to get an order of fried pickles. I would rather drive an hour to go to a hooter's than to return to this facility ."}
{"text":"All right.  If you're a straight lady going to Hooters then you're going for the wings.  Am I right?  Unless you're trying to prove something.  And I think I've been good about saying this - heck, I haven't had to say it yet because the QC has been a pleasant surprise for the most part - but every Hooters in Chicagoland has better wings than this Hooters.  Hell, the Hooters in Puerto Vallarta had better wings.  These were not as flavorful, the batter was not as... I don't know, flakey I suppose.  They were extremely mediocre.  Now I prefer to go to a small local joint over a chain most of the time, I prefer to try something new.  So dang it, if I want Hooters wings, they need to taste like Hooters wings!  Standardization, people!  Bah. Well, the server was sweet at least.  Sometimes when a couple walks into a Hooters, they get snubbed a bit because the waitresses are all leaning over the horny businessman tables trying to get tips. But Shaun (I think that was how it was spelled) was nice."}
{"text":"This place is horrible arrived after a concert and a basketball game and they were not seating people well before there closing time. The manager Juan was and idiot and said he was not seating anybody. The waitress said any other manager would not do this. There was a huge line. Hooters needs to rethink the franchise at this location. Need I say more Juan was rude and seated people behind us."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We waited 10+ min to be seated, over 20 minutes to get our drink order taken in. The waiter we had was talking to another one and completely forgot about us. When the food was finally out, everything was cold EVERYTHING! Wings frys everything. I do not recommend this place go anywhere else dont waste your money here!"}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend to watch a game tonight and we were seated just inside of the patio area. The garage door leading out to the patio was open, as the weather's been nice lately. I observed several people smoking at the bar, (maybe 4 yards from our table) as well as behind us on the patio. Me, being a smoker, I asked our server, Jasmine, if I was allowed to smoke in the area we were seated. She told me she would ask a manager just to be sure and said she would bring me an ashtray if smoking was permitted. She promptly returned with the ashtray for me, and before I could even fully light my cigarette, I was approached by a man who told me I was not allowed to smoke. I said, \"I just asked my server and she said she would check with a manager and they said it was fine.\" His response is the reason for my review and 2 star rating. In a condescending tone he replied, \"Well, I'm one of the managers, so...\" and walked off. Being a manager in retail, I found his response unprofessional, and ultimately rude. I moved outside to avoid conflict. My boyfriend had just gotten back from the bathroom after the incident occurred and naturally, I told him how I was approached and spoken to by the manager. It's not like I put up my dukes to sock it out with the guy over a cigarette, but the tone he used just rubbed me the wrong way. Long story short, (too late) my boyfriend alerted our server and she apologized multiple times before and after she went out of her way to DOUBLE CHECK with the GM who,( you guessed it) said smoking was indeed permitted where we were seated. Our food was great, my beer was cold, our server was polite and apologetic even though she was not at fault, but this other manager is the reason for making my night just slightly less enjoyable. Three words: Customer. Service. Bro."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE.   Walked in. Greeted nicely. Sat down immediately and never had anyone come back for over 20 minutes. Complained to the manager but all he said was \"ok\". Not I'm sorry or let me fix this."}
{"text":"It is typical bar & grill food. Obviously, most of the people are there for the \"atmosphere\" rather than the food. The staff is lazy and fools around a lot. The food is hit or miss. Only bother eating there on weekdays when they have specials otherwise it is really pricey for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time with the staff here. Great waitresses. 2 in particular Miska & Courtney made me and my friends dining experience a delight. Better even than the actual Hooters hotel restaurant. The one at the Palms had an amazing atmosphere. The food was fantastic and always good. Their chicken wings are always a go to. But seriously our waitresses made the experience the best."}
{"text":"The 3 mile island sauce could be a little more spicier, the wings could've had more sauce... service was OK being that the place wasn't that busy am giving it 3 stars because of the 3 mile island sauce it just went with everything just wish they had more sauce on their wings....."}
{"text":"Went back a second time no hostess waited 5 minutes no one greeted us or even acknowledged us I walked out wife stayed and spoke to management on duty that night and they acted as if they didn't care that there staff was offering such poor service. They have one more chance to get it right three strikes and your out"}
{"text":"Really dissapointed that this place use to be nice and CLEAN. WHAT HAPPENED? the last time there, it was disgusting. Crap all over the floor, the restroom (women's) was disgusting, REALLY GUYS? C'MON NOW! and it wasnt even busy. The service was good, food was not so good, bland boring. forgettable experience, I dont think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Service was very inattentive and disinterested. Two major qualities that are important at an establishment such as this one. If you are thinking about coming here, I urge you to reconsider. If they sell you on the smokehouse wings, make sure they have them before you order. Because they don't know these things, apparently. Three thumbs down."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY THEY ARE AHOLES! I wish I got the managers name since she thought it was so funny that we were unhappy.   The check in clerks ( all female) were so rude!  We checked out early. Went back 3 minutes later Bc we left a charger in the room and made a federal case out of it for us to get it back. We waited 30 mins and the manager came and she was no help and kind of smirked and laughed under her breath at us Bc she knew we were upset. Really??? I will never in my life come here again. The rooms where very nasty. The halls smelled like sex and drugs, and the service is below zero."}
{"text":"Entered with a party of 20. Service was terrible. Avery the waitress was working hard to make sure everybody was taken care of but the manager and the cooks were terrible. I ordered 10 piece wings and a side of fries. Fries came out 20 mins later cold. Took another 20 mins for some hot ones. While waiting for them to get my fries the cooks still never started my wings. Long story short, i was the last one to eat at my brothers graduation. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Ordered buffalo chicken salad to go. Paid $13 and change with tip. Got back to the office and the lettuce was brown, chicken was boneless wings thrown on top instead of a chicken breast cut up. They were soggy and less than warm. I get this salad all the time at the Arrowhead location and it is so good I crave it!! Totally disappointed and based on other reviews I don't think I will be eating at this location again. I gave two stars because the staff was friendly enough and I didn't have to wait to get my food."}
{"text":"If u want Hooters that look like your food come here Hooters. Some wings look like breast some look like legs Hooters come on by and howl"}
{"text":"Been a couple of times before and had AMAZING service from Annaliese but the Manager Tim Fussell was very unprofessional with the girls that work there and seemed bothered when I had questions about the menu! I"}
{"text":"I have been to this location upwards to 20 times and have yet to have an experience more than mediocre at best. You will be waiting FOR EVERYTHING...THE ENTIRE TIME. Drinks, whether water soda or something from the bar will take a solid 20 minutes. Your appetizer (If it doesn't come out cold) will be completely finished plus about 45 minutes before receiving your actual meal. Now, if you were asked about additional alcoholic beverages to kill the time, this might be okay....but you will not be. I love hooters wings and have tried, so hard, to give this location the benefit of the doubt but I have officially had my last meal there. Save your time and money...If the service were great and the food came correctly in a reasonable amount of time the slightly over priced average food may be worth but as it stands now I suggest you keep driving."}
{"text":"Very pleased. Very good bar type food and the girls work very hard to give great service.   Very happy that we spent lunch money here."}
{"text":"Here on business so room was paid for, definitely not my choice and won't be my choice in the future to ever stay here. I ordered room service and got wings, probably the worst wings I've ever had. The \"wing\" sauce is basically melted butter and when I called to ask for a spicier sauce I was charged about $4 for a very small side of spice sauce that turned out to be more melted butter with a hint of spice. The girl in room service seemed to have an attitude because I asked for more sauce aka butter. I won't even get started on the rooms needing to be updated. All in all I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the room but very disappointed on the food here"}
{"text":"Yeah, this Hooters leaves a lot to be desired.  If it closed, I don't think many would notice.  I mean, it's a Hooters.  You KNOW what you're getting the moment you walk through the door.  Although, this one is a little less on the service side.  The food is good, (good, not great) but the girls, MGR., service, sucks.  Better hope everything is okay when you get there, b/c there's no fixing it.    Unless you're going for beer & to flirt, keep going."}
{"text":"We waited about an hour for appetizers and tacos even though it was fairly empty. When The food finally came it wasn't hot anymore and the taste of the food once it came... It was okay. Definitely not bad but sadly not great. The 2 star is only because of the great location."}
{"text":"Ok so I don't understand the negative reviews and the lower ratings for this place. My friend and I went to the Palms for a concert and decided to eat at Hooters. It was our first time here. Our server was Bree, and I would ask for her again. She was super nice, friendly, very helpful on what she would recommend that we order. She was always around if we needed a refill on water or anything else, but also not a bother. She actually was in a jog from table to table at one point! She is the best. If they lose her, I'd follow her to wherever she goes next. In this town finding a server that does as great a job as she does, is very rare. We got the 15 wings with General Tso's sauce for $20.49 and we also got the one pound burger with curly fries for $16.99, the two of us split both items. I'll start with the wings. We got them 'naked' which means that they have the skin on and are fried, but they are not breaded. Now since this is my first time here I have never had breaded wings here, but I wouldn't get them either. I'll stick with these as they were perfect! Hot, the General Tso's sauce on them was perfect blend of spicy AND sweet. They had a definite fried crunch when you bit into them but the inside was moist. A+++.  The burger, we split between the two of us. Now, they come with no condiments on them so you need to ask for mayo and mustard, no big deal. They brought it out super quick. We cut it in half, it was cooked to perfection, and was super juicy. I'd say this was the perfect meal as I'd want some wings and some burger. I did tell the Manager that we would be back and that Bree was awesome as we left. But if you go there, ask for Bree's table."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I've ever had in my life! Waited 15 minutes to get drink orders, then another 15 minutes for our beers. Waited another 30 minutes for our wings on wing Wednesday and my friend didn't get his crab legs for 1 hour and 10 minutes after we ordered. Over all it ended up being a 2 and a half dinner after a 12 hour day of work we were not expecting. The 4 of us had our own tabs and the waitress screwed up every check. We felt hostage, all we wanted to do was pay and leave. Then she didn't bring us a pen and we had to ask another server. DONT COME HERE IF YOU WANT A QUICK MEAL! And as a side note the girls look like there all in high school."}
{"text":"Came in and waited for 5 minutes with no acknowledgement. Found a server and she was busy talking with a friend. She said she saw us and will be on her way soon. Another 5 minutes she finally brings us a menu. It took us 30 minutes to get food. The fish tacos had 1 shrimp in the taco itself. Had to ask for wet naps after eating wings. Almost done with meal when server asks how our meal is. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Hooters locations I've ever been to. We came the day of the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl (2012) to watch games and waited 45 minutes (nothing wrong with that, lots of fans in town). Once we were sat it took 15 minutes to get two ice teas and order our burgers.   After 30 minutes our burgers were nowhere to be seen and our server hadn't returned to check on us even once. We grabbed another server and ask to check on our meal. She came back with two burgers (which were prepared wrong), dropped them on our table and walked away. They were cold. Literally cold.   I walked over to the counter and asked the manager to come by and look at our meal. He was very frustrated. You could tell that he was in a bad position and his staff were sub par, at best. He promised to have new burgers - cooked properly - within five minutes. We were sitting in a small table right in front of the counter and saw them come up within minutes.   It took our server 15 minutes to even look for them, hence they were cold again. We showed the manager, asked to leave and he granted it. Hence, after nearly 1:30 we hadn't eaten a bite and went somewhere else. Brutal service and a core group of girls who didn't seem to care, period."}
{"text":"I usually don't review chain restaurants, but I had a good experience while here. They were the only bar downtown that was showing the UFC fight and there was no cover,  bonus! I arrived around 545 to watch the preliminary fights and snag a good seat for some friends that were arriving a bit later. I had a few beers and ate a good burger, food was good. The service the ENTIRE time was good, just super attentive and on point. the only slightly-annoying-but-not-a-huge deal issue was that I had  my table and was there for over an hour watching the fights. Once teh place started to fill up, the hostess informed me that I couldn't save any seats and that it was first come first serve. Not a huge deal as I don't mind sharing a table, but tell me that up front so it's not an awkward surprise when you just arrive at my table with some random people. In the end, no biggie. I was able to get a few extra chairs and all was well (and I totally understand having to make room for people that are already there vs people that aren't). All in all, great service and a good place to watch the UFC fights downtown. I'll DEFINITELY come back to watch the fights."}
{"text":"I find Hooters over priced and the food is just alright. They can't really accommodate special requests. Service is good though."}
{"text":"close to our house   loaded tots with no bacon is the reason we have been here a couple of times..(and beer of course)...tots are always super crispy, nacho cheese like a ballpark, and cool sour cream and green onions (it comes with bacon, but we ask for a minus bacon)   other than that...it's Hooters...they are almost all the same :)   gave it three stars because the service is almost always slow here at this location  don't get me wrong the ladies are super sweet, but if you need a refill and there is no one to be found...it's like they forgot that you are sitting at the table..."}
{"text":"My wife purchased a \"VIP Package\" for Hooters to support a local Breast Cancer support fundraiser.  We took our 4 children and some of their friends to the location in Tempe.  The place was pretty dead for a Friday Night.  The manager\"Brain\" a chubby bearded fellow who looked like he spent most of his time in the kitchen was clueless about customer service.  The waitress ASHLEA was very attentive and salvaged the evening. I really believe that since I our party consisted of two men and 7 women that we were not a typical HOOTERS party.  Brian didnt see big tips for nice tits as an opportunity to out perform.  I guess if I ever go to a HOOTERS again that I better have a handful of cash an erection so I fit in"}
{"text":"some good wings forget buffalo wildsuck and, yes they have tv's here too. way better scenery here sorry wildsuck that's the way it is."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I been to a Hooters but I gotta say... WHAT HAPPED TO THESE WINGS?!?! They used to be soooo good! They were lacking flavor and just tasted cheap. I was disappointed and actually had to order something else!  Nonetheless, I was actually impressed by the bartenders. Service was amazing! Staff was energetic, happy, talkative, and very accommodating.   I recommend coming to down a couple of drinks, but it's a shame to say stick to another joint for wings. This Hooters wings are not up to par."}
{"text":"Good service, cold beer, nice girls, open 24 hours... hard to beat! They even allow you to bring your four-legged buddies with you while you sit in the patio. Good place to hang out and watch your favorite sporting events!"}
{"text":"Okay, I know what you're thinking...\"Five stars is a little aggressive for a Hooters, lady!!\"I know it might seem this way, but it's about time I post my review for this location. My husband and I have been coming to this location for a little over a year, a short while after it first opened. You can call us \"regulars,\" as we come AT LEAST once a week, even more, during football season. We are definitely regulars for a reason--we love the ambiance, the friendly staff, and the food is consistent.   We very rarely have any issues with the food, but if we do, the managers are more than happy to make it right (especially the one with the shaved head, I am so sorry I can't recall his name, but he goes out of his way to make sure we are 110% happy with everything). The beer selections are good, and the drink menu is good too. They've worked out a great system for watching football on Sundays where you can see, clearly, which games will be on what TV (they have lots). They also show the UFC events. It is never \"too loud\" (unlike the Buffalo Wild Wings next door; sorry if I sound like an old lady...I am only 26).    Probably the reason I rate this location 5 stars is because of the waitresses. I think Hooters, unfairly, gets a bad reputation for being trashy because of its \"kitschy gimmick.\" But the girls who work here are don't act like \"slutty\" at all (unlike from what I've seen at Twin Peaks or some Tilted Kilts). They are genuinely sweet, and always remember us. Karen, Alex, Brittany, Jessica...all great ladies just to name a few. I respect them a lot. We will definitely keep coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"It was awful I always get oysters at hooters they were small and a little green and found out 20 bucks they r cheaper at oyster bars the waitress told my husband ok to substitute chili instead of fries and just pay difference all she did on the check  was charged full price for chilli and didn't get fries . I got a salad she forgot my ranch I had to hunt down a ranch and she tried to charge me extra also my husband got a blue cheese burger and that was what it was no tomatoes or pickles or lettuce just blue cheese n burger..Long story short family of 3 $58 a small hot dog, bad oysters, nothing burger , no fries , overpriced chili, small salad and we drink water. Bad"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant every thursday you can get boneless wings for 59cent they are delicious and you can choose from 15 different sauces for your flavor"}
{"text":"Service was great while I was there for AYCE wings on Monday Night.  The wing selection could have been larger, but overall it met expectations. Only complaint is the noise level is sort of unbearable. I was basically screaming to talk over the TVs."}
{"text":"I'm not one to indulge in FRIED FOOD however I am a mother of teenagers and they do enjoy Hooters so o find myself in a location or two once in a while when I break down after being asked 30-40 times over the course of a month or more. Tonight I ended up at this location with my youngest teenage daughter after our mother/daughter night at The Knight Theater.  Because I mealprep I had my meal already in the car before we made it to the stage show. In route to Hooters I tried to scarf it down but had a little left (I don't do fried food) so I carried my little container inside with me in my purse and asked for a corner booth so I could discretely eat my food while continuing to enjoy my daughter company while she indulge in her fried food frenzy. Our server Dep was extremely nice and attentive. She took my daughter order promptly and checked on us and even made small talk. The manager on staff on the other hand was so stalkerish. He kept walking pass our table trying to see what I had (I do understand worrying about someone maybe with a weapon or suspicious item, so I pulled my container out so he could see it and not mark me as a suspicious character). He immediately called Dep into a corner to stifle her about me having food as oppose to coming by and speaking to me as Dep wasn't aware I only had a spoonful left.  NOTE: There was two other people in the restaurant who were seated way away. I understand bringing in outside food which could influence others so my starrage isn't because \" i can't \" bring in food, it's more so because of the way the manager handled it, I would've appreciated it if he would've come over to speak to me instead of stifling an employee in front of the customer without even addressing that situation. Reminds me of the episode of Undercover Boss at Hooters.  Anywho I don't really like fried food but I will eat it if it look and smell good and I'm having a OFF day. Dep is a 5 star server."}
{"text":"Had a dispute over being charged twice due to the host's stupidity and manager was semi helpful but a complete jerk. Food was good, but the customer service was trash"}
{"text":"Greeted when we came in. Ordered Daytona wings, good as always. Order of shrimp tacos is where it all went downhill. What we got were 3 flour tortillas filled with poor tasting cabbage and 3 count em 3 small shrimp per taco  showed the waitress but she said they looked normal. Wings are not worth the trip over here you can get the same anywhere and the tacos sucked. Not worth all the homeless you have to drive thru to park over here. Try another location!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here after we did a little sight seeing downtown. It is Hooters lots of people great fun. Sam who waited on us was real good. Always made sure our glasses were full. The shrimp taco was awesome. Good spice to it."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this less stars. Service was horrible. Karen or Devin (she gave us two names) was slow and unresponsive. Restaurant was empty yet it took her almost 30 minutes just to get our drink orders. We had a table of 6. Another part of our party was sitting at another table and  informed us they had the same server and she was complaining about our table the whole time. Needless to say not sure I'll be back nor will I recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up some friends for wings. The server was super nice and accommodating to our needs.   We had the giant wing platter which is 50pcs for 41.20 and was able to order it 1/2 with breading and 1/2 \"naked\" (without the breading)   The wings took awhile to come out but they just tasted a little different from the hooters casino.   The breaded wings weren't as breaded as they are in the hooters casino.   The smoking area was kind of a turn-off because thats where the bar is and where they serve food. Really gross."}
{"text":"We came in to have the unlimited wings on Wednesday. Our server Nicolette came to the table with a smile on her face greeted us and got us our drinks. We asked her how much the pitchers of beer were she said she wasn't sure that it was her first night that she was gonna check. She came back and said with tax it was around 7 bucks. So we ordered one when she came back with it she was like sorry guys it's actually 13 bucks.( we wouldn't have order it knowing it was $13) but having it there already poured we took it. No biggie her first night she is learning the menu. We all order our wings it took about 25 minutes and only one out of 4 orders came out. It took another 15 minutes for the other 3 to come out. No sliver wear for other entrees. we Nicely stopped another girl and she had a terrible attitude about having to get us sliver wear. Don't bug her because she ain't getting a tip from us because we weren't her table. (That was her attitude) our refills on our wings took a lot longer than they should have. You only get ONE ranch or blue cheese with unlimited wings if you order more you get charged without being told. Come on hooters how is one tiny cup of ranch enough for unlimited wings???? Over all we understood it was Nicolette's first night she was very cute and very nice and working hard, but the food service was rocky and the girls are very pushy when delivering food one girl almost knocked a wing out of my dads hand reaching over him ( no excuse me or pardon my reach) just boom arm in the face. I know it's not a 5 star luxurious restaurant but at least have some manners. We will probably visit the bell road location next time we go!"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying this was our first time to Hooters and I figured I would come take advantage of the mothers eat free deal. Well let me say that I wish we would have went to anyplace but to hooters. The food was not even close to hot and was not what I expected from a Hooters restaurant from what I hear about the establishment. We were all very disappointed in the food and the service was terrible as well. We never received any refills on our drinks and the things we did ask for were never brought to our table at all. It was a horrible experience and really cannot believe for such a big name that the food and the service was worse than burger king..."}
{"text":"Meh. If you are looking for a sports bar with the older groups I guess this is your place. Food is ok. I do like the many sauces you can pick from. They need to freshen up their menu and get some variation. The staff was super friendly, fast and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is great, and they have the best chili in town. However, the kitchen is extremely slow, so make sure you have plenty of time to wait for your food."}
{"text":"Service is awful food is awful host don't seat in order but by if they know you and when you got to corporate they don't care and don't ever give a sorry guest are nothing to this place just give your money and move on"}
{"text":"As an over the road truck driver, I have been to many Hooters over the years. I usually expect standard service, standard fare, and cute women. I'm not looking for anything special. This truly has to be the worst Hooters I've ever visited. They moved a wait to be seated sign onto the patio, when 10 tables are available."}
{"text":"I have been a Hooters fan since I was a young buck, so I have visited many throughout the country. I must say that this one in Charlotte is by far one of my most favorite. The service, food and environment are awesome."}
{"text":"Wings were better than most hooters! But we were cut off after 4 beers even with a dd, they say corporate rules cause there is no common sense in the store, server was good, but came to hang and have beers with buddies but were forced to leave by fun police"}
{"text":"Don't ever call and place an order here it's way too loud in the background and the waitress was rude. First off I tried to get the 20 wing order and she said she couldn't split it into 4 different sauces so I got smart and ordered 2 10 pieces and split it into 2 different sauces each order. She should've just done my 20 piece order. Second of all I tried to order Honey Thai wings and she said \"I don't even know what that is\" in Chicago that's one of the most popular sauces. I questioned myself and thought I had the name wrong so I looked it up and BAM hooters honey Thai wings popped up. I understand if not all locations have the same sauces but she didn't have to say that. Third they don't have a front desk or counter to pick up. You have to go to the bar to pay and pick up. The vibe was so weird. The only good thing about this were the wings."}

{"text":"An odd place to celebrate my birthday but I'm odd to begin with haha came here around 10:30pm. Also note this was my first time coming here.  AMBIANCE: Wasn't crowded and the bar was practically empty. I noticed two cooks in the kitchen. Pretty quiet on a Thursday night if you ask me.  FOOD: We decided to completely pigout and ordered 50pcs of wings half breaded and half naked, and mozzarella sticks. Cheesecake for desert. I also had their vodka and lemonade as well. The wings($34.95) were pretty solid. Tasted really good and were spicy enough for me to handle. My boyfriend and I couldn't defeat all those wings though had to take some home instead. The mozzarella sticks($6.95) were disappointing. I believe they were still cold on the inside because when I took a bite there wasn't any yummy gooey cheese stretching itself out! Boooo! But still tasty. The Vodka lemonade was strong and not watered down which was good! The cheesecake($3.99/slice) was surprisingly good! The caramel and nuts that came with it made it even better.  SERVICE: Service was 50/50, there were two girls. The first girl who I believe her name was Chantel was friendly, smiling and attentive. She made sure to check back on us, either that or she was watching us if we could take on the 50pcs of wings lol. The other girl who I didn't get a name was cold and she seemed bored and ready to go home.  If you want wings this is a good place. Though I don't think I'd be getting anything else here."}
{"text":"Hooters is always a cool place to enjoy some cheap brews and football games (during the season of course), but this location wasn't too exciting. I usually attend the Hooters at the Tropicana hotel or at Sunset Station casino but I was leaving church off the strip and ready to catch the NFL season openers of football.  A few friends and I decided to go to this Hooters location for some food and football. As soon as we arrived and walked into the resturaunt the host advised that Directv was down all over Vegas and they're only showing local tv games. Huge upset for NFL fanatics such as ourselves. Since we made the drive thus far we decided to stay. The waitress was very friendly and funny. Grabbed our drink orders as soon as we sat down and quickly brought them out but then again we were the only 4 customers.  Food was ok. I ordered steak nachos and was expecting carne asada or actual steak on my nachos but that's what I get for assuming. The portion of nachos was great. Huge plate, mounted with nachos. My nachos were kinda good but mostly upsetting. The steak was like steak umms (TM) sandwich meat, the cheese was obviously from a can and was just heated up instead of being shredded or fresh cheese, and there was more jalapenos than steak, chips, and cheese. My friends had steak quesadillas that were delicious and I wish I would've ordered those instead.  Overall the location is kinda in the middle of nowhere and the food isn't all that its hyped up to be. And the fact the host told us that Directv was down all over Vegas, even casinos, and nobody was able to watch the games was a complete lie. I have Directv at home and had friends a casinos who was able to view all games. Not really knocking this location but me personally, I'll never spend my money at this Hooters ever again."}
{"text":"I was here last night to watch the fight. The place was jammed packed. The security wouldn't let is in the door at first, but after a while we made a to go order and was let in. We placed our order and they allowed us to stay in so we could order some drinks.  The reason why I'm only giving them a 2 star rating is because of the attitudes of the hostess and waitstaff. They deal with overcrowding every time a major sporting event is on, it doesn't mean they should treat paying customers rudely. That's just not nice."}
{"text":"Have been to this location numerous times but today was a bit different as it was my daughter's 21st birthday and \"supposed\" first real drinking experience.  Our waitress, Jenny, was excellent with making it an enjoyable experience for her (and us). The girls sang her their version of 'happy birthday' and the food was well cooked and timed with the appetizers perfectly. Again, I don't normally hit the Strip but it being a special occasion and the wings being her fave, it made sense. If the line gets long, ask for the bar.  If you're looking for a simple selection, Hooters is it."}
{"text":"This hotel is the worst hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at. Although the employees and staff were nice, the hotel itself was horrendous. The first night we checked in my wife took a shower and the water went from scorching hot to cold back to scorching hot. We thought that it was a one time thing and didn't want to make a big deal because accidents happen. That same night we came back from walking the strip and it was cold outside and inside, so we turned on the heater and it smelled horrid. On check out day my wife took another shower and the same thing occurred. So we called the front desk to file a complaint. I spoke with the manager by the name of H. She stated that we should have report the first night and that there was nothing they can really do now that we were checking out. We weren't looking for no more than a sorry but we didn't even get that. So everyone that stays there beware."}
{"text":"Been here for over 20 minutes haven't received food yet and no apologies from wait staff. How long does it take to make wings and fries????"}
{"text":"Had a great time here!  People are so shocked when a chick wants to go to Hooters!  I freaking love Hooters wings. Obviously, I'm pretty confident with myself that I have no problem heading over to Hooters and whipping down some wings and a few root beers.  Sorry, I don't drink.  The waitresses are actually pretty fun.  My wings were awesome and I had a side caesar salad that was delicious.  No problems here whatsoever!  Loved it!  It was walking distance next door from my hotel. I played a ton of slots in the casino after dinner and had a blast!  I thought it was cool that it was mostly Hooter Girls dealing at all the tables.  My boyfriend was totally jealous..Oh well, next year he'll have his chance when we come back!"}
{"text":"Upon one of my visits to Vegas I stayed at the Hooters hotel. This brought for many late night visits to the Hooters restaurant since it was open 24 hours. Very dangerous and unhealthy, I know. They know just how to get you.   If you're dining at any hooters restaurant at any location, your order is always going to consist of a pretty basic meal. Such as wings, beer, sandwiches/burgers, apps, tacos etc. My favorite thing to order was the buffalo chicken dip. Until this very day, I have yet to find another location to make it the way it was made here. I cant lie, I do miss it. Pro tip: if you order the dip as a take out, they give you a much bigger portion. As for the wings, any flavor you go with when ordering wings is a good choice. The Daytona beach style wings are another one of my favorites.    Pretty girls and good food, why would I possibly give it 2 stars you ask? Well, the service was pretty much awful to say the least. It takes them over an hour to bring out an appetizer not to mention how much longer it takes to bring the actual meals out. Like I said, I only remember the service so well because of the amount of times I came during my visit. Each time, day or night was the same. The only time you'll actually see your waitress is when she first greets you, after that everyone else bringing your food and drinks are different. Not even for the refills will your waitress be present or attentive. She will only appear when its time for the check and that's it. I just don't see how they expect to get a good tip doing this? We even ordered it one day for takeout to bring up to our rooms, they got the whole order wrong. I swear it was something different every time. They certainly have to find a better way to fix the service here.   They have me trapped with their buffalo chicken dip. I promise if it wasn't for that I would not return to this location again. But, if you don't really care about that, which I'm sure you don't, I wouldn't recommend this location. I love hooters anywhere else, but not here if we're strictly basing it on the service."}
{"text":"This was not our first rodeo at hooters, this was our first time at this Hooters! Our service was AWESOME......food was fast and great! I would stop again anytime!"}
{"text":"The red head bartender Kelli was great!  The kitchen WOW they took forever.  Was end of lunch time and Mexico FIFA soccer game was on but don't see why so long.  Will come back though! Hooters makes you happy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went this past weekend and had a blast! Gabriella was our server and she was such thee best"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of five they had several empty tables but still had to wait to be seated. The restaurant wasn't busy seeing there was one patron sitting at the bar and only maybe 4 or five tables occupied. Our server took our drink order and we ordered an appetizer.  Our server brought us our drinks and we asked for some more time to decide what we wanted to order. 15-20 minutes later our server came back and asked if we were doing alright. She then remembered that we hadn't ordered yet. She apologized and said that she had put are appetizer order in already. Where I was seated I had a good vantage point of the entire kitchen. I could see tickets were stacking up and food was not coming out. A tall white guy seemed to be running the show in the kitchen and the wait staff were upset that food was taking so long. Two of the five cooks were standing next to each other and talking and joking around. When the wait staff inquired about their food the tall white guy scoffed at them and made rude remarks. After about an hour our food finally made it out, well kind of. They gave my buddy and I curly fries when he ordered tater tots and I ordered big dipper fries. We all received our food except my son who ordered the kids burger. We told the waitress the problem and she took our plates back to the pass and talked to the tall white guy and he sent her back to our table with the plates. She said that we could have the curly fries and they would bring out additional tater tots and big dipper fries. 15 minutes or so later she brought a huge side of tater tots and a huge side of big dipper fries and my son's burger. The tater tots were super dark and way over cooked and when my son opened his burger the inside of the bun was black charcoal burnt. I showed our server and she took the burger back, 15 minutes later he got a new burger with a bun that was edible. Our server came back later and apologized for all the problems and that's when I explained to her that I knew it wasn't her fault and that I could see the issues in the kitchen.  I told her that if it had been my restaurant I would fire the entire kitchen staff.  She explained that it had been a busy week, I told her that the person in charge of the kitchen seemed super unorganized and unfriendly. She asked if I was talking about the tall white guy and I said yes, she told me that he is the GM. This place needs an overhaul starting at the top, this was my first and last time coming to Hooters."}
{"text":"Last time ever going.   I keep giving it a shot during spring training but I'm done.  Just walked out after waiting 28 min for fries.   No more than 25 people in the whole restaurant. Zero care for customer service.   It's very obvious that the only thing they care about are the beer drinkers for spring training games.   Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"To say the least I would certainly watch sports at the Casino Bars or Sports Book rather than this over priced parade of mediocrity!! The food is average at best the Restaurant had dirty uncleaned tables and the talent well....why would they(the women) work at Hooters when you could be a cocktail waitress at the hotel. The drinks are over priced and the management unaccommodating! They tout the location as the largest Hooters however it completely lacks the feel of what Hooters really was meant to be! Try the actual Hooters Hotel or other Vegas/Henderson locations if you want the true Hooters Experience. This place receives one star after trying to receive satisfaction from the management resulting in food which was un edible and patrons whom were clearly over served and creating a disturbance."}
{"text":"OK, lets call a spade a spade here folks, if you're going to Hooters there is better than 50/50 chance that you are not going for their fine pub fare or the beer. You can, but lets stop pretending and just be honest with one another - honesty feels so much better. Its a novelty to visit a hooters and if the food happens to be good on a given day that's an added bonus.  Past visits to Hooters on Adelaide in Toronto were in my pubescent teen years, and quite frankly they could have served me warm gruel and I would have asked for seconds if it meant the waitress would visit again. That being said I stopped going when my palette matured and I realized the wings were fair at best.  Fast forward several years and needing to kill some time after work one day I decided to stop in for a quick beer on their amazing rooftop patio. Let's face it given my location, where was I going to go? Hipster patio across the street or Hooters where the A-team was working? 200 points if you guessed the latter  I ordered a pint of Michelob Ultra to start and after about 1/4 the server \"somehow\" talked me into 10 wings with a side of carrots and celery. I decided I would give their wings another chance, and to be fair they had improved since last time BUT were still selectively saucy (bald patches everywhere) and were deep fried just a little too long.  All in all a good spot for a quick stop, and a great place to come with the guys for a brew and a game. If you're looking for gourmet dine dining keep on walking. As they say in the biz with Hooters \"it is what it is\"."}
{"text":"I crave the breaded lemon pepper wings here. But after increasing their prices and charging 20 bucks to watch the ufc on a picnic table next to strangers..."}
{"text":"I come in here very often and the service is great, girls are always really friendly and on top of everything.  The management on the other hand, is horribleeeeee. The managers treat the girls like they're dumb and talk down on them constantly. On top of that, they don't allow them to have breaks nor drink any kind of drink, including water while on shift. I've brought my friend Starbucks quite a few times to it just be thrown in the garbage. I would not give this hooters any business because of the way the girls are being treated. It's unfair and not okay. I'll pick a different hooters to go to from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and when I arrived I was told that they forgot my order and had to wait for it to be made. Once I did get home with the wings, I found multiple hairs in the wings. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Service was great, beer was super cold (26 degrees), I lost count on how many micro-brews they have on draft, but they have all of my favorites.  And of course, they have great wings.  Also, no shortage of TV's It is a Hooters, so if you don't like that type of place, then don't go.  But other wise, if you want a great cold beer or two, some wings and service by a nice, friendly staff, then head on over..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible ! Sunday afternoon with really no crowd. Took over 30 minutes for wing order to be served. Thought waitress passed out or left the building since she didn't come back to refill my tea for another 15 minutes after wings were served. While eating my business appointment showed up and ordered a salad from my waitress. Said she would put the order in but was leaving and cashed my tab out. He finally got up to talk to management after 30 minute wait for a salad. Finds out the order was never placed by the retiring first waitress. Salad took another 20 minutes to finally be served. No management or new server really cared to say sorry or comp some of the charges . When we left several waitresses were sitting on the counter by the front lobby! Might have been nap time because the service sucked! One and done in going back to this site."}
{"text":"I went today (11/4/15) for the all-you-can-eat wings. We received two severely undercooked wings and several that were questionable at best. I called the manager over and he said they weren't undercooked, it was \"discoloration from the bone\" and offered to make more!  Really?  UPDATE:  It's now 12/2 and I have not heard back from Corporate in response to the email I sent them. Clearly, customer service at this company starts at the top."}

{"text":"So we went there for lunch because it was across the street from where our conference was at and we had limited time for lunch. I ordered the 10 boneless wings lunch special and my buddy ordered the chicken sandwich. 45 minutes later we finally got out food. Some of my boneless wings were at best the size of McDonalds chicken nuggets. The rest were smaller and to even out the 9 \"regular\" size nuggets I got, I think they threw in a few pieces left at the bottom of the bag to make it 10. I went there specifically for the wings because of good past experiences. This experience with the food was terrible."}

{"text":"In Phoenix for family event, staying ( whole another review) right across the street from this Hooters. I was very tired and hungry get something to eat and go to bed. There are a number of restaurants in this area but i did not feel like walking and it was HOT. SHOULD HAVE WALKED.  I ordered the Chicken Garden Salad, this was a sad salad. I know I should have set it back but I didn't. I didn't because there was nothing else on the menu healthy ( as close to healthy as you can get). The lettuce was wilted and not enough, chicken was good, not enough filling.  I gave them two stars because of the waitress, Kyra very attentive, hospitable and friendly. I will be back to Phoenix will stay some place else and eat some place else."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and catch some of Rio Games.  The server Morgan did a great job.  The burger was good too.  I would go back for sure when up on that side of town."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the restaurant is a nice one   I'm just getting off of work from a 3-11 shift wanted to wind down with my normal Long Island so I placed the order. About ten minutes later the waitress comes and tells me that they don't have one of the liquors for the drink and to choose another so I did. And of course ten minutes later again I was told they didn't have the certain liquor there as well. Family of four and my brothers wings weren't correct as well as my sisters sandwich not be accurate either. Yes I understand you may close at 1:00am but there is no need to slack towards the ending of the shift only giving two stars because the food was ok once everyone got situated. Nice place nice environment but have to get better with communication with your guests."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and needed to find a familiar place to remind me of the good times I have at home. Hooters happened to be around the corner from where I was staying so I decided to give it a shot. I could not have made a better decision. The establishment was in pristine condition. I love the setup including the 360 bar. But above all, the most impressive thing about the experience was our server, Dep. The place was busy so things were backed up at the bar and kitchen. She was constantly paying attention to us and getting things to us as soon as possible. She could not have been more friendly and patient while also being pulled in so many directions due to how busy the restaurant was. As usual the food delivered (always go Daytona) but Dep really made the experience worthy of a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Hooters locations and this one is unique in that the girls are attractive, and it's a good dining experience.   I have been to this location mostly for college football and just concluded basketball season,  and have been thoroughly impressed by the teamwork.  I'm always able to find immediate seating and promptly greeted by waitresses that aren't even assigned to my table.  The drinks are always filled and the food is always prompt and made to order.    It's obvious that this location is well managed as everyone chips in, as I've even witnessed managers bussing tables, running food, always available to accommodate whatever game or channel you'd like to watch.    I will keep coming back and inviting more friends to share in a great ball game, good food, and great service."}

{"text":"This is NOTHING like what I expected. Yes, many of the Hooters are all the same, but this doesn't compare.  When I walked in, I noticed that many of them were not as attractive as I see back in the states. I said, no problem, I will sit down and have some dinner.  I started off by ordering Buffalo Shrimp, hot. I received the shrimp, and they were tough because the person in back over cooked them.  I didnt see my waitress after she dropped them off, so I just decided to eat them. While I wasn't happy, I didn't want to leave as I was still hungry.   I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak with just a little onions and peppers. She came back 20 minutes later and stated that they messed up in kitchen and if I didn't mind eating it with mushrooms. Yes, I mind, I am allergic to them!!!  I told her to just give me the steak with cheese and forget all the veggies. I didn't wnat them to pick out just mushrooms as cook was already careless twice with my order.  I then saw the cook swearing and yelling about having to cook it all over.    I was just happy to get food, check and leave. I wonder if this location is ever checked by the corporate office. If not, it needs to be."}
{"text":"I give the extra star for the pretty waitresses...yeah, they did something right.  Anyway, do you like eating frozen bagged food dumped into a deep fryer while your waitress, in her tight shirt and short pants, flirts money out of you?  The soda was a bit watered down, the chicken was disgusting.  It's embarrassing how much the waitresses try to embezzle tips out if you.  Let's face it, this is what the guys go there for.  They certainly can't tell you that they go for the food...again, it was disgusting.    My suggestion, if you want to meet women, join a dating site, if you want good food, go somewhere else.  In either case, don't go here."}
{"text":"So we came here the other night for old time's sake. I think I've been to this location more times than any other Hooters anywhere else. Probably because we'd meet here for drinks and food before hitting Mill the rest of the night - sometime ages ago. Mill in my opinion isn't that much a worthwhile destination these days but here we were - Hooters. I decided to shake things up a little and get the hottest wings they had - triple dog dare. When I ordered them the waitress's expression changed. I half expected her to bring a priest to administer last rites or something. But when I actually got the wings - they turned out to be pretty darn wimpy. Even Zipp's wings at just regular \"hot\" level are more intense than these. Talk about overhyped. My friends already know not to help themselves to MY order of wings because I almost always order the hottest possible. They end up sorry they did. LOL. Not even meant as a nasty trick - that's just the way I like it. So I was disappointed that they were overhyped but they still hit the spot. One friend ordered the boneless wings with buffalo sauce but was very disappointed in his order. Management was very professional and courteous and ended up taking it off his bill. Extra star being added for that. Place is right on the southeast corner of Mill and 5th and has been there forever. Parking is where you find it - metered parking on Mill or some nearby parking structure."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Hooters EVER! We live in So Cal and make it a point to come to this Hooters every time we are in Vegas. Tyler is AWESOME and our bartender, Tammy is so friendly and AMAZING! The Daytona wings are yummy. Thanks guys for a great time every time!"}
{"text":"Went late on a Thursday night after getting off the plane. The best hooters we've had and we have been all over the U.S.  They food was cooked perfectly! We had boneless wings, breaded wings, curly cheese fries and beer.  Loved it all!! Now those obviously aren't hard things to make but if you've been to hooters at all you know that most of the time, food is not usually their first priority!  I would def go back here!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, food came out right away, and didn't have to wait too long for a refill on my drink"}
{"text":"I must admit, I eat here about twice a year.   It's nothing more than typical bar food.  There is certainly nothing fancy about the beer and usually the folks that eat here are just the average working man.  The first time I had hooters was in Miami back in 1992.  In fact, that was the first time I ever had a hot wing!  I have never had such great wings (at least not here).  But what IS good here is the chicken sandwich.  They have many hot flavors.  If you order just NORMAL, the sauce is butter (literally).  I prefer the hottest one which is NUCLEAR.  Even this isn't THAT hot.  They also have 911 sauce.  For the longest time, I thought hooters named their heat sauce after the terrorist attacks because when the planes hit the two towers, a lot of heat was generated!!  As it turns out, it just means DIAL 911!!  THIS SAUCE IS HOT!!  Anyway, go here and get the NUCLEAR CHICKEN SANDWICH!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's just a bunch of guys rating this that didn't get flirted back with or girls pissed because their boyfriend's got flirted with  ((shrugs)) dunno don't care. This particular location at least deserves a better rating if for no other reason than the fact that the server was informative about the deals gave me all the info on new products and was just an over all AWESOME server! THANK YOU SELENA! As a visitor from out of state I was greeted and seated quickly, served exactly what I ordered in a timely fashion AND THATS WHAT ITS ABOUT. Thanks again for the pleasant experience and cheers all."}
{"text":"This was a much nicer looking Hooters than the now closed one at Sunset Station. The restaurant appeared clean and well kept. Our waitress was friendly and attentive enough. Usually at these type of places waitress will ignore you to chat up the guys for a bigger tip and ignore the tables with females...it wasn't the case here. We had their signature wings in a cajun and mild sauce. The wings were great, especially along with a pitcher of beer. :) I would return here based on the service and food."}
{"text":"We went to Hooters for my daughters graduation party. We had 12 people, We ordered 50 wings and some appetizers. It took 30 minutes to get the food and the order was wrong. We had to ask for silverware, dressing for the salad. We didn't have enough plates. It was hard to get refills and the food was awful. The manager did come over and say well this is a big party so it takes time. Yet we were the only people there, Never will I step in a Hooters again, So disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Staff is lazy slow and inattentive they can bearly make a burger   I ordered the big hootie burger. McDonald's could make it look better  Pathetic"}
{"text":"Good wings and beer...bad hostess...average waitress...music too loud...overall pricey"}
{"text":"Terrible wings, overcooked and no sauce. Service was decent. Would not recommend. Quality has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Sucks that most of the girls here are all on drugs sniffing cocaine in the restroom and come out taking orders like a slow zombie. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I love chicken.....I love chicken wingssss...  In Southern California, which is where I am from, I usually have my top places to go for chicken and or wings so I never ended up going to Hooters.  So while I was in town for the Arizona Ironman, me and my buddies decided to try out the hooters in arizona.  Yeah...you can see I was concerned about my protein intake before the race LOL...This is not the usual type of food people eat before an endurance event such as the Ironman but hey you only live once right?  So we go up the stairs and get seated and we order our drinks and wings.  The wings were kinda big and fatty.  They weren't very good...and all this time I heard that their wings are good...blah!  This is the first place I saw the Miller Lime Beer though!  Whats up with that....  I'm sure it gets busy with college kids though since it's right by ASU.  But the food wasn't so hot and umm the girls were average as well."}
{"text":"We went into this Hooters on a busy Saturday afternoon and were expecting mediocre service. This was not the case in the least bit. Our waitress was great and the food came out hot and so delicious. We always go here for the wings but now they offer the healthier smoked option. Definitely will return and thank you Erin for making my kids day."}
{"text":"Chris the manager, was very sweet and nice. In fact every time i go in there, he is the most desirable manger there is that works there. The other managers come off a bit rough and short. Chris is very personable.  He took care of everything I needed if my waitress was not in sight. The food is pretty good. Looks like they are finally doing something right."}
{"text":"I give it this hooters 3 stars.  I love hooters wings and this locations wings were like anywhere else.  This casino/hotel/restaurant is pretty old and dingy.  The location is in need of a remodel."}
{"text":"Where to start?  The Pros?  Clean Good service Friendly girls Good food comfortable  Cons?  We ordered -Build your own burger-    Choose the bread, meat, cheese, Veggies and then it says extra toppings are such and such price.   We also ordered flavored Iced tea.     The bill came and there were charges for cheese on the bill and charges for the syrup in the flavored lemonade.   The menu doesnt say nor did the waitress note that the flavored part of the drink would be an extra $2 nor did she mention that the burger doesnt come with cheese, its extra!   She showed us on the menu in the teeniest print where it says, extra cheese $1.99...Yes, but we didnt order extra cheese, just cheese.    Well thats extra we were told.   She left with the bill and did take the charges for the extra cheese off.    They need to change the menu and they need to warn the customers of extra charges, flavored iced tea $2.99 flavored-is extra cost, or something, not throw a surprise charge in there!  The girls did take a photo with me and my baby hooter owl when we left so that was a plus! He got a mouthful...I mean he got comfortable, thats what I mean, Yes...     All in all we would go back for the food.   :)"}
{"text":"It's strange.  I've only been to one other Hooters (in California) and I remember the wings there being a lot better.  The ones here seemed smaller, greasier, with a slightly buttery taste.  Not exactly bad, and not exactly great.  For my money, The Chicken Shack in Henderson is the way to go for primo chicken wings (my own endorsement, but they should still pay me).  Oh, and the women here weren't so bad either."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep going back. The girls are always new, because they can't keep anyone there. Apps and dinner always come out at the same time. So tonight we sent out app back; two reasons: it came Out with our food, it was cold. Maybe we should just stop trying to go on Wednesday!maybe it would be better."}
{"text":"Normally we go for beers and crab legs.  This time the first set of legs were dry and over cooked.  Although we mentioned it we just ordered another one and they were better.  Service was great and they were nice.  Could have been just one of those days but the wings crab and other food was mediocre."}
{"text":"As a former hooters girl, the service was average. The resturant was clean and the girls were friendly. A manager greeted us as well. My food was EXCELLENT, however my husband's wings were under cooked and pink. The manager quickly took care of it with a fresh batch of wings and also took the wings off our bill. All in all it was great and I would return !! Yummy"}
{"text":"I\"m with Christopher W. on this one. I recently went into this Hooters and it is HURTIN'.  I have no problem going to Hooters - they DO have great wings (Not that I eat them, but the company I keep likes them)! Plus after my many experiences at the Hooters on John Street in Toronto, I have been missing the patio and the fun crowd that would always gather there.  A trip to this Hooters definitely didn't help my Hooters fix. There were only older men in the joint and it was pretty deserted overall.  It's safe to say I'll save my Hooters nights for the T-Dot. It's just not happening up in here!"}
{"text":"All is right with the world. After going to that gawd awful hooters in Vegas and getting the worst wings I've ever had anywhere, I needed to wash that memory away..Stopped in here for a quick lunch. They have 2x as many beers on tap, a nice open setting, cushioned bar seats, well placed tvs and polite quality hooters girls. Also, the wings were perfect!!! Thanks for restoring hope in mankind. I can rest easy again."}
{"text":"It's Hooters. Free UFC, wings, beer and young girls in 80's style outfits. Is what it is."}
{"text":"5  for the attractiveness of the girls. They had two blackican (black-mexican mixed) girls that were just gorgeous, slim bodies but just crazy pretty. There service was also very good which sometimes goes down the better the girl looks. I'll give the inside of the physical restaraunt a 3-4. I like sitting at the bar but this place had a small bar and with bad tv angles. It's just designed awkwardly. The outside seating may have been better but who the fuck wants to sit ouside in Tempe in the Spring. Besides that, it's hooters, same menu, same quality. I'll go back to just to check out those chicks. Easily the most attractive girls/women I've encountered in my long storied career of Hooter hopping."}
{"text":"Was staying across the street at the InnPlace Hotel over a weekend. Spent half my time at Hooters. Place was clean. Beers were insanely cold (blue  moon was a little frozen!!!). Girls were of decent hooters quality and even chatted me up while I sat at the bar (I have nothing to talk to a 20 year old about, nothing) but it was cool. Service was pretty fast. Watched a UFC PPV, since I only had a 2 minute walk, got there early and posted up at the bar. Friendly crowd there for the fights...Went back the next day to have a beer and do my fantasy draft on there wifi, great service again, nobody had a problem with my laptop and excellent hi-speed connection (code \"wings83rocks!\"). I rarely give fives out but having been there on back to back days from super crowded to sort of empty and both great experiences, a 5 is what they deserve. Nice mist covered outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Hooters Uptown really upset me today. A couple of co workers and I went to watch the usa game and someone standing at the front door would not let us in claiming they where full. The problem was that they where not full and he just singled us out. I think because we are American's trying to watch the usa soccer game and hooters must have not wanted any part of that. so anti-American if you ask me"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving Hooters a five star review but I came here this past weekend and the food was great. The hot wings were actually some of the best I've had in a while, perfectly sized and cooked. The curly fries were also fresh and hot. The blonde bartender was a babe (I wish she was on-tap instead of Bud Light), but surprisingly I left even more impressed by the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Hooter's has really good food and they have amazing boneless hot wings. They have lots of tvs which is hood for dporting events."}
{"text":"If I can give it no stars I would. Mind you we came on a Monday wings night, but for such a big place the service is absolutely unacceptable. We were given the wrong drinks menu with the wrong prices, we ended up getting charged incorrectly, brought up to the waitress who brought it up to the manager, who told us we should read the menu:/ read what menu? The drinks menu is a small card, doesn't indicate it's a 4a7 menu.  All our wings arrived late and cold. We didn't get any of the flavours we ordered.  I spent almost three hours eating here and I still haven't paid my bill yet; I have enough time to write this review while I wait."}
{"text":"this Hooters is open 24/7. nothing better than getting great wings and a beer @ 4am.Great management and staff. Glad to see Andre back."}
{"text":"Can't believe these are still around.. well actually I can. All the pervs go here for the girls. Definitely not the food. Worst wings I ever had."}
{"text":"The worst, empty tables and there is a line poor hosting and table management. Asked to sit at the bar rude girls at front said no. A reason that I haven't had hooters in awhile and will other have it again. Just gone to shit with everything"}
{"text":"CLOSED - Well, moving to Metrocenter in March - BOOOOOO, i don't want my car stolen....."}
{"text":"Just before Christmas we were in the Palms and went to the new Hooters. Worst service and food that we have had in any restaurant in a very long time. When we finally got our food it was horrible and not edible. What a shame as the build out of the restaurant is very well done. We go to Palms all the time but will never eat at this Hooters again.  The only thing good about Hooters was the 2 hour wait kept my wife from gambling for 2 hours."}
{"text":"The food is bad. Just bad. We have the chicken wings with a spicy sauce and bbq sauce, onion rings, nachos and fried calamari. Nothing was seasoned and they all tasted bland. The calamari was like eating rubber. The onion ring didn't taste anything. The nachos had a weird nasty goo as cheese. The chicken wings were bland on it's own and with the sauce added it didn't really help.   Although our waitress was super nice and friendly, the service was awfully slow. It takes around 45 min to get good and 45 min to get the bills. We stayed for a total of 4 hours and most of the time was for waiting.   The place itself is clean and nicely located. They have 3 floors to accomodate big groups like us. However I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Typical Hooters establishment. Tons of seating and good looking servers. I ordered all-you-can-eat wings and everything turned out perfect. The service was perfect and the girls very attentive. The manager even stopped by a few times to check on everything. Beer was cold and plenty of TV's to watch any sporting event you want!  Everyone here seems to be on top of their game, I will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Slow service, cold wings, and all food (apps and entree) came out together. Staff was nice-ish."}
{"text":"This hooters currently connects to the pool.  We were starving after laying out in the sun for a couple of hours and this was the most convenient option. You can't take any drinks ordered inside the place to. The pool but you can take the food."}
{"text":"The service was not what I expected. The girl got our orders mixed up, and I had to go find her to get our beer order that she forgot.  For the first time we tried the boneless wings.  I have seen boneless wings that my daughter has ordered at other places and these didn't look anything like them.  They were mostly breading and no meat. Very unhappy. We've been to Hooters in other places and this was not the normal service."}
{"text":"Went in last night with my wife, food tasted good at the time. Service was quick, and we had a friendly waitress.   But that's where the good ends with this place. As we we're waiting for our check, a waitress seemed to be having an argument with some guy near the front door which we could hear from across the restaurant. I'm understanding that it seemed thrust upon her, felt bad for her, but where's management to say \"take it outside\"? Don't know what it was about but was shocked that it was allowed to continue inside the restaurant for several minutes. Between this and the guys yelling across the restaurant to talk to certain waitresses: terrible environment to be in.   But more importantly: after finishing our meal and getting home, both of us did not feel the good, something was churning in our stomachs....My wife woke up in the middle of the night throwing up, this happened multiple times. Today she had to miss work because the food made her so ill.   In the end it was not a great atmosphere, somewhat out of their control, but more importantly the food made us both SICK! Why go out and pay for food that makes you physically ill?....obviously stay far far away from here!"}
{"text":"For Will S who likes to comment on the reviews. Instead of  merely saying your sorry about a persons experience with the place. Maybe truly try solving the issues.  You have received several of the same type complaints over and over, but no change....."}
{"text":"We had our friends bachelorette here. The manager was great and let us use the game room. It was awesome! We played beer pong and our waitress Alex rocked! The wings were tasty and the tater tots were so good we decided to agree for tonight that they counted as a vegetable and ordered an extra plate. Awesome experience."}
{"text":"We love coming to hooters we come at least once a week!!! I can't complain about the food but I can't not write a truthful review of this location...  The girls here are far from friendly, in fact they seem bothered by accommodating customers and even serving them.  The male manager is awful. We saw him put on the NFL games on non hd, when asking the server if they were in dh she said she'd ask, we saw the manager shrug his shoulders as if he doesn't know (even though we saw it wasn't) and told her tell us yes.   Lastly, they ran out of fries so had jack in the box fries.... It was awkward and again the manager is seen walking around looking miserable and bored.   Wish I could give this location more stars but I'm being nice giving them three as it is.   Also, the hostesses seem to hate helping, mumble and walk fairly ahead of you.   It's just awful service by most staff and the manager.  Go downtown they are much better!"}
{"text":"This place is total garbage.  Do not waste your time here. If you want good food, you can get it somewhere else. If you want to see hot girls, they are all working somewhere else. Despite what others have reviewed here, the wings are gross. Greasy and either over or under cooked.  The service is horrible and the cooks look like they just dragged them off the street and told them to work.  Don't be fooled by the Hooters reputation (whatever that may be to you). For whatever reason you think you should be going to Hooters, you can find it better someplace else, especially in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really craving wings, walked in sat at the bar was served a beer right away and told asked the waitress food food menu now I have waiting 45 mins while others around me have got there food order in while I am ignored The bartender Emmy has to be the worst at her job. I will never set foot in the place again."}
{"text":"This place is what it is I mean you don't come here for chicken wings! well I guess some of us do. The interior is nothing special and the beer selection is not great. I I ordered a mixed platter of appetizers which had shrimps wings and calamari. The shrimps were OK. Other items we meh. The menu had some interesting combos including one that has Dom Perignon!!!  :D Now for the main attraction the waitresses I don't think there were many for starters and worse none of them met the image what one might think of someone working here. They were showing UFC and there was no cover.Service was OK."}
{"text":"Stopped into Hooters to get some wings tonight in Concord. I had always heard Hooters has great wings. (I have not been to a Hooters in almost 17 years).  Well, I must say I disagree. The wings I just ate where close to the worst I've EVER had. For starters, they were tiny. Second, they were expensive considering what I actually got. And finally, they were not very tasty.  Disappointed is an understatement. $18 down the drain. Pissed!"}
{"text":"Horrible wings. It was so brightly lit it was blinding. Service was fast. Never again"}
{"text":"Cool bar with respect to televisions and space and... That's the end of the positives. The food is sub par... Chicken and burgers tasted like they were frozen (processed and very fatty) and the cole slaw so soggy it wasn't edible. Even the salad was bad with lots of rusty lettuce. No reason for any of this... As soon as a real restaurant at talking stick opens this place is done. Oh and the service is terrible... Took 45 minutes for 2 frozen entrees. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Somebody paid attention.  The food is still good and the service got much better.  They did the work."}
{"text":"Not a service friendly place. We came in with a group of five to sit at a table surrounded by waitresses who where standing around by the cashier talking, while another waitress sat with a couple of guys. We waited for about 20 minutes and still not one of the waitresses offered us water or any kind of service. I raised my hand hoping to get one of the girls attention and still nothing. We waited a couple more minutes before we decided to go to Tilted Kilt a few blocks away at City Scape. This is not the first bad experience I've had with Hooters but that just solidifies my decision on not visiting Hooters again."}
{"text":"First, the staff was awesome.  From the hostess to our waitress they really were great.  Every member of this Hooter's team was warm and friendly.  PLEASE let these wonderful people wear a jacket when it's so cold.  It was so cold  in that casino that our poor waitresses teeth chattered. I have been to many Hooter's all over and a jacket does not distracted from the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss and tonight was a miss!  Draft beers were filled two inches short of filling it. Sandwiches were lacking any flavor at all!  Wings were good!  Leaving very disappointed tonight, if it wasn't so close we wouldn't even consider this place."}
{"text":"This location is great for pickup or if you sit at the bar. We are always so disappointed and annoyed if we sit in thr bar area or dining room. The girls stand around flirting with the cooks, service is slow, and we never get all of our food or sides at the same time. So, we are forced to choose to either eat our food as is or wait and eat it cold. I would talk to a Mgr but I never see one. I'm sure they are there but they don't check on the tables . Very annoying ."}
{"text":"First time at a Hooters Restaurant and it surly was an A+. The service was beyond amazing and fast. Went their with about 27 other people and everyone received service and only took 45minutes total. I would say this place was amazing and would recommend to anyone looking for a great meal!"}
{"text":"If I could give this star no ratings I would. I have never stayed at such an awful hotel in my entire life. We had a do not disturb sign on our door to find out when we came back a maid had been in our room to steal over $300 dollars from our suitcases. When we went downstairs we found another guy with the same issue. The \"manager\" was BEYOND rude and would not let us watch the cameras in the hallway. He stated there was absolutely nothing he could do and and that we were all in the wrong. Why couldn't he watch the cameras is beyond me. He said if we weren't satisfied we could \"pack up our shit and leave,\" and come back on Monday to speak to someone else. So, at 8:30 at night we were desperately trying to find a room. Thank god we came across the Balley - excellent service and very clean. Not only was that an awful experience, but one of us got food poisoning from the restaurant inside. Room service was with a busy tone for hours and we were told to just come downstairs. What is the sense of room service then? Every vending machine on the floors were totally out of drinks. Terrible terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a quick bite to eat. Seen the adult smoothies variety and just had to have one. I was expecting a small cup size but it was actually larger and really good. Had the wings and was surprised how awesome they tasted."}
{"text":"They need to start upgrading the size of their wings. Went in several times and ordered their wings but they are so small that it only took a couple bites and we were done."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Great food, service is always on point and ice cold beer. I highly recommend the Daytona Wings, they cost extra but are with it!"}
{"text":"Joan is so awesome!!!! I live right across the street from here and come in here rather frequently. Joan has been helping me out ever bar visit that I've had. She's super friendly and always personable. Every time I come in I hope that she's at the bar because she's on point and nothing but smiles. So if you ever make your way here ask for Joan"}
{"text":"Been coming back here to watch various football games. They still have the best beer prices, especially if your drinking the beer of the month, which in November is a 25oz Bud for $4.00 Most Sunday's, the place is scarily quiet for NFL games as I counted four people at the bar and one other person in the entire restaurant during the Cardinals game on Sunday.  They have a bunch of $5 appetizers on Sunday also, but the mozzarella sticks were not up to par and the sauce tasted a bit burnt. Otherwise, all the girls are nice and some are more talkative than others and the manager here is a good guy as well. Some new food items available, but wings are probably the safest item here still and maybe a burger."}
{"text":"Haven't been into one of these places in a long while........ longer than I'd like to admit (cuz I'm old).  got out of work late,and was looking for quick munchies or dessert close to the hotel.   decided on some wings.  while I was waiting for my order, the bartender, Katie, was awesome.   It was a full bar, but she came around and cleaned my spot as soon as I sat down.  she was pleasant, and didn't give any kind of snide look when I didn't order a drink, and just ordered wings to go.  during my wait, there was an overly rude and obnoxious patron, making comments about Katie, but she she was defensive or snarky, but maintained an even demeanor, and diffused with light (appropriate) humor.  I imagine these women have to put up with objectification constantly, and I would imagine it gets out hand, but she handled it extremely well.    for her.  She definitely adds a star or two to the food.  As far as the wings.... I got the marinated/smoked wimgs with Gen Tsao sauce.  They looked great, and the flavor was really good.  A bit spicier than I thought, but I didn't mind.  I got the blue cheese,  which was OK, but they would probably be better with the ranch.  The wings came and she gave me extra handi wipes and napkins (aka folded paper towels).  Overall fantastic and very efficient service."}
{"text":"The food was good but the customer service here was horrible! I asked for a beer and got an attitude from the rude waitress Lora. To top it off I never even got a beer from her and had to ask a manager for our drinks which were on a seperate tab. Even the manager had to confirm the seperate tab. Good food, horrible service, don't let Lora serve your table if you're a female."}
{"text":"Every World Class City has its own Hooters and Toronto is no exception. But seriously, this is a place where food becomes an afterthought and you come here for one thing only, yep, the scenery.   All the basics of pub grub are covered, with hot greasy wings, cold beer, flat screen TVs and hot waitresses in tight Hooter outfits.  I love the rooftop patio dining here.  Great view of the CN Tower and the Toronto skyline."}
{"text":"The.worst.customer.service.ever. Had to get a manager to refill the very expensive beer stein the initial server \"sold\" us on. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I last stepped into a Hooters or even this location.  It was kind of dead on a Thursday evening, but I have never actually seen this location really busy in the past either.  Anyway, the menu has changed since last time and they offer more selections than before, a good change.  There is now 15 wing sauces to choose from and a wider selection of burger types, salads, and side dishes (like onion rings).  I ordered 20 boneless wings in hot sauce with fries.  The boneless wings were larger than expected, crispy and moist.  The fries, on the other-hand, were okay but needed to be cooked more, half were still soft.  My dad, and the reason we went there, ordered regular wings with no sauce and fries.  His wings are much larger than what they served in years past and were also very good; he didn't eat his fries though because they were not cooked enough (which he did request to be crispy).  Overall, it was a good experience, a definite improvement from past experiences.  However, the prices are still higher than most typical wing places, and there are several good choices nearby that can beat Hooters in both taste and price."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero star rating I totally would! We came here to watch the boxing match on ppv. There was a$10 cover charge to get in which was pretty ridiculous. It took FOREVER to get a server to our table and just as long if not longer to get drinks. After that she left our table without giving us an opportunity to order apps. Apps took forever and came out with our dinner (Hello?!? What's the point of apps if they don't come out first. Then they're just sides!). Our waitress was super snippy and rushed everything including when she took our order (she almost skipped my husband and I in a group of 6). We asked to speak to a manager TWICE and my husband had to call in which still didn't get a manager to us. We live in Oregon and LOVE our Hooters! I was so extremely embarrassed to bring my friends for such a horrible experience! Never ever EVER coming back here!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 different types of chicken wings, the hooters buffalo potato skins, tater tots, buffalo shrimp and I realized when me and my wife got the dishes, it was way too much food.  It was good - we have been living in Japan so chicken wings (American style) are not that common. Don't get me wrong, Hooters is like a good medium grade here in the states and this place doesn't do anything special, but when you've been overseas for a year or two and you have some 3 mile island Hooter's wings and a big soda, it hits the spot. The potato skins were awesome, I think I will definitely get those again, I had never seen them on the menu else where.  Its pretty amazing, I've been to Hooter's in Japan (girls are disappointing - no Hooters), and the choice selection of sauces and extra dishes is significantly more varied back here in the States.   I wish I could tell you this was better than your standard Hooter's, its just a Hooter's and sometimes in Vegas when you need a break, place to sit, and some wings, this place does pretty good."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Food was O.K. (it's Hooters what do you want) but service was terrible!!!!! Maby it's because I'm used to going to the Hooters in Beach Place Ft. Lauderdale where they are ROCK STARS!!!! Do your self a favor & go across the street to B-DUBS."}
{"text":"We have gone there 3 times since they remodeled and i had hoped they had figured it all out but they hire some of the stupidest people who cant use a pen and paper i guess. I gave specific orders to bring my toddlers food out first as they can in hungry and ready to eat. Not only did they not being it out first, but they waited about 20 mins after serving all the adults food before bringing it out. They expect a 3 and 5 year old who are very hungry to watch the adults eat! I had to serve my entire meal to them because it took so long for them to get the kids meals. And the food quality is always worst here then any location i have been to."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have encountered.  We were In there 20 minutes before anyone even approached our table.  And we had 9 people.  We could not be missed.  Once our drink order were taken ( half the table was water) we did not receive our drinks for another 15 minutes.  We were in there an hour before receiving food.  Manager brought the kids some fries after 30 minutes thinking that would help.  We went through 3 different waitresses.  Terrible experience.  I will never go back to this spot again until some change are made."}
{"text":"Yup, just as I remembered it, inside the Casino is darker than other Casinos, They do have an old Nascar car inside which is cool to check out  The games themselves are your typical Casino games, and are so so We've been parking here pretty much because they don't charge for parking, and its a short walking distance to the MGM Grand which has the Monorail."}
{"text":"Never again  Terrible service You are a number and forced out the door. Do not waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"We picked up the take out special.  40 wings, coleslaw, potato salad, fries, and gravy.  25 bucks plus tax.    The wings are kind of small and they leave the tips on.  Who eats those?  There's nothing on 'em.  Ah well.  We ordered the wings in two ways:  half original and the other regular.  The chipotle honey original battered were surprisingly good.  They were crispy and saucy.  The habanero BBQ regular was just average.  Saucy.  I would never eat AYCE wings cuz I ate like 8 and was stuffed.    Anyways, the coleslaw and potato salad were pretty small.  Just enough for two people.  The large fries were curly, and was a reasonable large size.  Again, just right for two people.  The gravy was just okay.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"There was literally at tops 20 ppl in the restaurant, we tried to call in a order to go. Attempted the call 6 times, no answer. So we proceeded to go in, they then wouldn't take our order at the bar and so we waited 10 min for a hosts to show up, who wasn't that pleasant. However a different customer placed a togo order at the bar directly in front of us.  After placing our order it then took another 45 min for chicken strips and a burger. When we finally got our food it was cold and had to send it back and wait again  No one had a smile on their face or greeted us.   Being a former Hooters girl, management better get on these girls to act like a true Hooters girl."}
{"text":"This place is well maintain, clean and spacious. I mainly go for the happy hour since it has good specials on wings and beer. When I order the food  it always comes out fresh. The waitress are really pretty but some are kind of ditsy at this location."}
{"text":"We stayed here on a business trip. After an exhausting day of work we decided to stay in and have diner in the casino we decided on something casual so went to hooters. We should have known we were going to have a bad experience based on how empty the place was! The waitress was very sweet and attentive but kitchen was extremely slow took forever to get our food and did not receive everything we ordered. We asked the waitress to change our order because we were un satisfied with the items or lack of items we received and she did and took it off our bill once our next order arrived they messed up on my bosses order and gave her plain wings with no sauce! She went to speak to the manager and he was too busy to even come over after she went to discuss the problems we were having with our food and the kitchen he asked her to apologia for us and compted our meal. It wasn't necessary he could have just come by and made sure it didn't happen again but no he was too busy on his phone he never approached our table. We were so disappointed and the waitress let us know that is how he usually is there is no control over the staff. Will never done here again!"}
{"text":"So I had the biggest craving for wings and it was 130am. I decided to call Hooters cause they were open and after looking at their website I noticed they had alot of new stuff. (This is probably the 3rd time I have eaten hooters. once in Florida, once in Cali and finally here in Vegas.) I have to say that I was very surprised, their food hit the spot, I called in an order for fried pickles, lot-a-tots, boneless wings w/ fries and 10 Wings TO GO. What really made this experience awesome was the hostess, she was awesome in helpiing order like having all the stuff for the tots on the side so they did not get soggy and also ordering the pickles extra crispy so they were also not soggy. I have to say I am really impressed. I will definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came up to Hooters to catch the UFC fight.  There was a 45 minute wait for a table due to the fight night.  Luckily my buddy found a group on a large bench on the patio that was only using half of it and was cool with us sitting on the other side.  Typical UFC fight crowd.  Youger guys in their 20s with lots of black attire with white lettering.  I couldn't believe there was a family in the middle of the patio.  Early 20 year old couple and about 4 kids ranging from 1-6 years old.  Right smack in the middle of people getting drunk and smoking on the patio at Hooters...no lie.  Absolutely rediculous.  We had probably one of the dumbest waitress of all time.  My boy ordered a Michelob Ultra (weak and embarassing as that is) and she was trying to spell and sound it out at the same time then looks up and asks \"what is that...a...beer?\"  True story.    I ordered 20 wings with blue cheese and ranch, half a dozen oysters, and my other buddy ordered a chicken quesadilla.  45 minutes to an hour later she brings out the wings with no dressing.  Had to flag her down to bring the dressing.  Still no quesadilla, still no drink refills.  Finally the quesadilla comes after all the wings are long gone.  I understand its a busy fight night but its still hooters.  Quesadillas and wings should be practically on standby.    The waitress would disappear for so long we just couldnt take it anymore and left before the fights were even getting to the good cards.  Service absolutely sucked, wings were below mediocre and I dropped 50 bucks on wings, oysters, and 2 beers.  No thanks.  Hope I never come back here and definitely not on a fight night."}
{"text":"I can't believe I actually went to a Hooters for the first time in 20 years! I had the new grilled fish tacos and a large Dale's Pale Ale. The fish tacos were EXCELLENT!! I could not believe it!  Last time I was there they had wings, hot dogs, hamburgers, and weak domestic beers...what a great change. 5 stars for the fish tacos and beer selection!"}
{"text":"Service is always great. Food is always pretty good. I love the atmosphere here and love spending time here with friends."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at a Hooters in years and it will be my last. I only came in here because I was on my way to the concert at Gila River Arena and figured Westgate would be swamped and I was starved and had to use ladies room. I ordered the boneless buffalo, I did not know it was all you can eat but knew I would only eat 1 plate and had to pricing mixed up. I thought it was 12.99 for both my sister and I. That is not a good deal unless you eat 2 or more plates of the wings. So I get my boneless wings and they are heavily breaded which makes them more like popcorn chicken from KFC and there is no flavor on them. If there was any buffalo sauce it was very little.  I should have sent them back but we were in a hurry so I ate 6 out of 8..small meal. They are also out of the beer I want so I had to order 2nd choice. So the bill comes out and they charge me 12.99 for the wings. I sent it back saying I was confused on the pricing and since I only ate 6 anyways I would have been better off with the 6.99 for 6 which I was going to order anyways. They charged me 9.99. oh well I accepted that. So I gave her my card and when I signed for it, I see she charged me the orig amount. I sent the bill back and asked why I was charged the orig bill and she said sorry it was a mistake an reran it again.   The worst over priced wings I have had. Epic fail Hooters."}
{"text":"How does anyone say that Hooters doesn't have the best wings? If those same wings were served in a mom and pop pub in Arcadia or Midtown, there would be 150 reviews with 4-5 stars. But because it's Hooters, food snobs will reach to find fault with them.  The service is outstanding. I've brought my rowdy 3 year old here and they are always gracious and patient. Let's talk about their service. A lot of restaurants in the Valley could learn a lesson or two about service from this Hooters. The waitresses check up on you constantly making certain your drinks are refilled, dirty plates are removed, and making certain you are happy with the food. And unlike many Hooters, the waitresses don't have attitude here. They are not wannabe models or actresses. They are nice looking friendly hardworking girls who do a great job. There is no attitude or pretense here and this is precisely why I will drive to this location rather than their Scottsdale or Phoenix location. The food is always served hot and crisp which isn't always the case at every Hooters. I don't give 5 stars very ofte"}
{"text":"Umm. I was forced here against my will under circumstances that will remain vague.... I know Hooters was a thing in the 90s, but it really shouldn't exist anymore.   Food: Had some tater tots and some of the wings. I had a few rum and cokes as well.  The tater tots were good, pretty cheesy. Wings were also decent.  Service and Atmosphere: kinda sad ... None of the servers seemed happy   and who can blame them?"}
{"text":"Even the tits you see in there aren't worth the outrageous prices they charge...... $1.00 per tiny wings that you needed tweezers to eat them with."}
{"text":"Thursday is amateur open mic comedy night. Not sure if this is a new promotion or they've been doing it for a while but that was the thing that made my group of buddies want to go.  The comedy is open mic and preformed by amateur locals. The host is a drag queen who is just hilarious and isnt afraid to offend or pick on some of the average joes attending.   The rest of the local comedians can range from 'please pass the mic' to 'omg did he just say that?' Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the easily offended.   Starts at 10 ends at 12  The food was a bit disappointing. We all split an order of 50 wings in Spicy Garlic and Mild flavors. After about 45 minutes the host announced the comedy night special which offered 10 wings for 5 dollars any flavor. Kinda pissed our bartender didnt mention that nor did she mention any of the drink specials. We all could have saved some cash ordering less and been a lot happier with flavors we individually wanted.  The Spicy Garlic was neither spicy nor was it very garlicy it did have a pleasing flavor but nothing you would lable 'spicy' or 'garlic'  The mild didnt have sauce of any kind, Bartender explained that it's just deep fried wings tossed in butter. She offered to take it back to the kitchen to throw some medium sauce on it so we let her, when they came back semi tossed in sauce nostrils flared from the hot sauce/vinegar fumes. The bark was obviously worse then the bite. The medium had no bite. The sauce was so mild i didnt think it was any improvement from mild at all.   In the future if i were to come back and order wings i'd request them to be naked and unbreaded. The breading is pretty thick and i cant remember tasting very much chicken at all.   Getting to the point. Hooters is the go to place for sports, beers, wings, and eyecandy in lots of other cities but in Las Vegas there's just so many other places that do the job better."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ: PLEASE READ: PLEASE READ  I hardly write reviews- In fact I never do - but for this hooters I'll make an exception.  I am from the east coast- I enjoy hooters ironically enough I was at MGM next to the hooters casino - I live in Summerlin, and thought I would drive out to spring valley to an actual restaurant.   I sat in the gaming area of the bar and it was dead needless to say it was 1130. Anyways - I go in sit down greeted by a nice BT I think her name was tosha or something with a t - she had blond hair- she greeted me I told her I was going to play and I ordered a beer. I noticed there were two guys in there along with myself - and a drunk guy that left pretty quickly - these two drunk guys were playing all the games and winning which was cool- and the bar tender seemed to be in it - the two guys that were winning were getting louder then they came over to my side of the bar - they were using every vulgarity you could use- but not in the half way bar acceptable use of the terms - they were using phrases and terms that you would hear on workaholics but 10x worse. Anything involving a woman - and her anatomy and what goes with that- purely disgusting. Mind you I came to eat. What really shocked me - he had a black hooters shirt on- he was a manager or something! Def FOH. I don't have a problem with drinking after work but he ruined my appetite and granted I put 200 in the machine I didn't get one comp for two beers and a chicken sandwich. Thirty bucks for all that after I played 200 worth of BJ- and listening to the manager talk to his drunk friend while his gf (the bar tender) was sticking money into the machine - GO TO TWIN PEAKS SO MUCH BETTER - hooters is great but this one sucked - and the bar tender should be embarassed of her boyfriend and manager and frankly herself-   Understand I'm not a prude I drink like a fish and I swear like the catholic I am. However, that was by far the worse experience I have ever had- I have no sympathy that hooters  is losing to twin peaks. They should be"}
{"text":"One on the worst ever. Waited 20 minutes to get waited on. Another 15 to get one beer. 15 more to place an order. Food isn't here yet and it's been almost 20 more minutes, so can't comment on that. Others stated it took over an hour to get their meal.  Don't do it if your thinking about lunch!! Manager came out in what may have been an attempt to apologize. Was more like a list of excuses. Said he wanted to make it right. We'll see...."}
{"text":"We waited for a table and then we waited for service.   Once we were at our table, we ordered an appetizer right away. That came out quickly along with a pitcher of beer. However, for a pitcher of beer, you need glasses.  That seemed like a shock to our waitress.   We had to ask for everything a typical patron would need, including our check. So disorganized, like they didn't want customers."}
{"text":"Manager is a huge pos of a person has no idea how to manage a place or deal with customers I want the district manager's number at this point don't come at me like that."}
{"text":"We came for business. Finally wanted food after training all day. Didn't think the food was going to take over 1 hour to get.  It took us two hours to eat and get out. There was a larger group that came in later but left earlier.  What happened to our order?  No manager ever came by either. Also, their system sucks on who got what... could be the lack of experience from the server. We were so hungry. The server was nice but could have come by more often. I had salad and asked for dressing on the side. I sat there without dressing for 40 min until she finally stopped by again. I didn't get my dressing until everyone else got their food because of the lack of followup.  I don't know if it's just Charlotte but all the food service I had this weekend was horrible. A few ppl had the wrong plate in front of them.  I won't be coming back even though I like their wings."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I can never forget the waitress asking me what temperature I would like my chicken to be cooked at...Last time I checked, I would like it severely cooked... Thank you very much! Ironically, my boyfriend ordered a burger but she didn't bother to ask him how he would like his burger to be cooked. This resulted in an over cooked, dry to the bone hamburger. We couldn't even finish our food... We only went here because it was the only place still open late around the area, other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Favorite places to gamble at specially the fact it's $3 blackjack and $10 for table games all day long."}
{"text":"STOPPED in here for a few drinks before a Charlotte Hornets game recently while in the US. A most enjoyable experience. Could not have been happier with the efforts of my server, Autumn. Very talkative and quick to inquire as to whether I wanted another beer. Couldn't have made me feel more welcome. Also had the woman who was manager on that night (Monday) stop by the table a couple of times to speak with me. was glad I stopped in and will certainly return when next in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Most Hooters restaurants are the same: attractive women in outfits straight from 1983, showing moderate cleavage and a friendly demeanor, serving up comfort food in a sports bar.  This location is spacious, offers booths, and the servers are quite nice.  They take good care of you, provide refills in a timely manner, and deliver good service.  My boneless wings were a bit well-done, but they probably would have been better if I ordered them with a sauce rather than the cajun rub.  Overall, it was a positive and fun experience -- and the fried pickles are a must-have."}
{"text":"Honestly!  This hooters is the worst and 3 reasons why . 1.customer service  2. Attitude  3. Work ethic  Seems like they pay way more attention to men, which is understandable, but just like those gentlemen are paying customer , so am I ."}
{"text":"Bad service and cold fries. Bummer... we got here at 6:30 expecting to be seated as usual but the dining room was full. We were offered at seat hugging the bar so we took advantage but weren't served promptly at all. I had to grab a server because they just kept walking past me... I asked for hot fries and they came out in less than 5 min room temp. I can't stand asking for something specific and not getting it. Tips would be higher if we were waited on attentively."}
{"text":"I love Hooters! The girls are so friendly and sweet! They brought my daughter a balloon and sat and chatted with her about school! The owner of Hooters even stopped by to check on our table and he made us feel so comfortable and welcome! This was such a great family experience and the food was so delicious! I'd give it more stars if I could! I can't wait to come back & see all our new friends!"}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd time ive been here.  The other 2 times were during the day.  Service was crap, but whatever.  After 10 this place is so shady you'd think you were at a bar by the stratosphere.  It just becomes a crappy bar in a nice neighborhood.  There are no \"Hooters\" girls.  The excuse is that it's the graveyard shift.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Its hooters.  If you really have to read a yelp review on hooters, then you probably shouldnt be going there.   Things to obviously know before entering hooters:  expect greasy food, slow service, chicks only mildly good looking thanks to butt lifts and makeup, annoying guys who think they are all going to be the next UFC champ, loud sports on 13 tvs, and some drunk guy getting into someones face in the corner causing a scene. The good things to expect is good food at decent prices that is fairly consistent regardless of location, good happy hour (depending on when you go), and great cold beer.    I give it 3 (this goes for the whole chain) cause i love their buffalo shrimp and buffalo 'chicks' sliders, and of course the wings.  However, I would give this location a 2 - it seems to attract a questionable clientele.  Last time we went on a Monday, sat outside on the patio watching the end of a basketball game, being only 1 of 4 tables in the place.  These guys were sitting behind us at different tables and started lightly arguing; ten minutes later it escalated to punches and beer being thrown literally over my head with the cooks and managers coming out with the cops on their way - subsequently slowing our already slow food by another 10 minutes.  Lastly, I will say this - DO NOT bring your kids here.  Nothing says classy good parenting like hooters - there is a reason there isnt a kids menu."}
{"text":"This was the second time I went to HOOTERS at Concord, NC. The first time was years ago, when I was on my vacation visiting my brother at Mint Hill, NC. Food was great and one of the girls was very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends a few weeks ago and the staff was very friendly and took care of us. The manager, Chris, came to our table to make sure we were having a good time and that we were having a good experience. We were. He was very personable and seemed to be on top of things. We will go back again!"}
{"text":"As this was the site of my first UYE, and I had a blast due to the awesome people I was hanging with, I might not be as harsh with my review as I should be.  I'd visited the Hooters in Brampton before it closed down, and had a horrific experience there with terrible service. Compared to that, this Hooters was a treat! The waitresses were really cute (if not really um...voluptuous, as the company likes to boast), and ours was polite with me.  The restaurant was pretty drab, and even though it wasn't all that busy, extremely cramped. I hope my fellow Yelpers didn't think I was going for free-touches while trying to get through to go to the bathroom...I was just trying to not trip and fall on my face :-o And don't get me started on the bathroom. One of us remarked that they seemed \"rapey\", and I'd have to agree. It's funny that people love making connections between Hooters and strip clubs, and this is just another example of that odd connection. All that was missing was the ice in the urinal and some pushy bastard trying to spray ManWhore For Men on you for tips.  It should also be noted that even though it was a chilly, rainy evening, the restaurant was extremely muggy. I'd heard a lot of positive things about the patio, but unfortunately, that wasn't an option.  As for the food, it was reasonably priced I suppose, and their wings were alright as far as wings go, but I just can't get past the annoyances mentioned. Luckily I was in great company, so I still had a great time.   And those uniforms really aren't that sexy anymore. I saw way more provocatively-dressed girls walking out of the clubs on the way to my car."}
{"text":"The most disgusting food I have ever been 'served' in my life. The grilled cheese sandwich was nothing more than two pieces of Texas Toast bread that had been smeared with butter and thrown in the microwave with two greasy slices of cheese in the middle. The fries were cold and the service was less than desirable. There were only about four other people in the entire restaurant, and yet our 'waitress' never bothered to give me a refill......I didn't bother to leave a tip.  I don't recommend anyone go to the Champaign Hooters. Instead, go to Buffalo Wild Wings - WAAAAAY better!"}
{"text":"The food is very good! Also awesome service by a girl named Alex. Also it's open 24/7. Came for lunch and very pleased!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Hooters for the beer, food and to look at the women... this location only has cold beer!  What happened to their practice of hiring good looking women?  I am off fried food, limit my beer intake and there absolutely no good looking staff here - the women are are all out of shape and tired looking.  They need to get back on the ball!!!"}
{"text":"ambiance agréable , musicale , bonne cuisine americaine et surtout pour les garçons...jolies serveuses en minishort orange trés charmantes"}
{"text":"Okay, so you go to hooters.  What is it you're expecting?  a) good food b) compelling scenery c) all of the above  If you answered anything but (b), you are deluding yourself.  Hooters has some appallingly bad food.  I mean, it's atrocious.  I have never been to a place where so many menu items are downright offensive.  Burger? dry. tasteless.  Steak sandwich?  *goodyear tires*  tater tots? 2 stars, half of the stars come from the fact that they use movie theatre cheese, which is magnificent.  Fries?  Curly.  Like pubes.  Chicken wings? Breaded.  BREADED?  It's like they're going out of their way to make their food suck ass!  Yet I still bequeath them with four stars, and the reason is that I don't go there for the food.  In fact, I try to time my visits to correspond with non-meal times, as in: I eat, then I go there.  Because they have beer, and they have flirtatious staff.  They should be docked three stars for the support-stocking tights they wear, but that's not up to them.  So at the tempe location, I have to say that the ladies there have a healthy dose of charisma and charm, and this all in addition to the fact that they are cute.  They sing, they dance, they look at you lasciviously, even though they don't mean it... in short, it's everything you look for in a sports bar.  I didn't choose hooters today, because I never do, but I rate restaurants for a)what they attempt to be and b)what everyone should expect out of them and nothing more.  four stars, just not--and I repeat *not*--for the food."}
{"text":"After catching a movie, I tagged along with my friends at downtown Phoenix, we were hungry it was past 10pm on a saturday night and we found this place open. I ordered the Original Buffalo Chicken Sandwich along with a coke drink, good service and good food."}
{"text":"I guess this is no longer on my list of places to go when I have a wing craving.  Almost no sauce on the wings.  \"Medium\" buffalo really is mild (or maybe it was because of how little sauce they used).  I'm not sure if celery was included here... but 4 sticks of celery for $1.39 is what they charge now.  And... when I requested just 2 more sticks (as 4 is really not enough to compliment 10 wings) I was charged an extra $1.09... for 2 (half) sticks of celery... yeah... I'm kind of done."}
{"text":"My husband and I got to Hooters around 6:10pm, was seated within 5 mins. Our waitress brought our drinks out and took our order, everything was going great until we got our food. The sliders (cheeseburger and the buffalo chicken) were not good, the burger was dry and the chicken was just a plain tender. Wings were good and we ordered a side of curly fries, well our curly fries did not come out with our food, the waitress was MIA and we had no refills. Waited to pay but again the waitress was no where to be found so my husband was irritated at this point. My husband spoke to the manager (he was nice) and he deleted the order of fries. I get it was just me and my husband but we normally tip pretty well. But I guess the waitress thought since we weren't a group or a group of guys she thought she could do whatever and not serve her table and this is why I'm giving this hooters one star."}
{"text":"I went for Monday all you can eat wings for 13.99$ with the purchase of a drink (which could be a soft drink) from 4pm to 7pm. Looking at the cost alone I did not think this a deal for all you can eat wings- if I end up eating 20 wings at 1$ per wing maybe I am eating my money's worth. The chicken wings came in an assortment of flavours, boneless vs with boned, various sauces and rubs. The wings were normal sized and looked like they were from normal chickens vs genetically modified so that was comforting to know. You can only order one plate of of wings/pp at a time, so that also accounted for the delay. I liked the honey garlic wings the most. Drinks were very cheap.  The place gets filled pretty quickly. Management was great checking on clients regularly. We even got to see a hooters birthday cheer (hilarious). Only thing I disliked was in the middle of our meal at 5:30 pm the lights just turn red like you are jaundiced baby needing therapy..it was so weird, I couldn't even see my food properly. I guess that was the Hooter's touch? not feeling the Hooter's glow! Lol.  Would I come back here? no thanks but glad to have tried out the Canadian Hooters experience."}
{"text":"I would honestly give zero stars if I could. I work at Hooters myself & the service here is beyond slow when they aren't even busy. Bartender Alexis can't even get the order right, stops to check her phone more then the customers sitting at the bar.  & Openly talked bad about a customer once they left to one of the guy bartenders. Definitely don't recommend this place at all.   -Anissa Santana"}
{"text":"Ordered the hottest wings and they were not very hot.  OK food at best.  Service was good."}
{"text":"So the Palms tore out a couple of restaurants and put in what is supposedly one of the largest (or the largest?) Hooters restaurants. It's open to the casino floor, but finding a way inside was actually difficult. We went to where the main welcome mat and sign were, but it was blocked off. After circling the entire place, on the opposite side, we found an entrance with a hostess stand. These ladies clearly did not like their jobs.   Every empty table in the area to which we were led was dirty. All them had been cleared of dishes. But there were lots of spots of food and sauce. Not fun. We had to clean off our on table.  Our server was fine enough. Somewhat attentive. Definitely in a hurry to get us out of there. Also didn't seem to like her job at all.  There was bad rap music blaring. Blaring! We could barely carry on a conversation sitting right next to each other without yelling. And it was late on a Monday night. Not like it was some hopping weekend party.  The food took a rather long time to arrive. Much longer than any of my other Hooters experiences. Longer than most other restaurant experiences period.  The wings and fries were fine and just what I expected. The cheese sauce that came with the fries at this location was actually a spicy cheese sauce, not the regular one. It was good. We opted to try the triple dog dare wing sauce - supposedly their hottest sauce. It wasn't hot. And it was far too sweet for my liking. I think I'll be sticking to the spicy garlic from now on.  So in sum, food took longer than usual, but tasted as usual. But the ambiance and staff here definitely leave something to be desired. It was not a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of Hooters. There, I said it. This particular Hooters location happens to be next door to my favorite nail salon. So I find myself here for a drink sometimes. When you enter, you can go to the bar area or the restaurant area. The bar has gaming and smoking. There are also some tables in the bar area. There's also an outdoor patio area. But basically the thing to like about this Hooters is the ability to play some video poker, get a free beer, and smoke. The bartenders are nice and friendly. Hit or miss as to whether or not they are attentive."}
{"text":"This place was a hot mess! Silverware and tables were filthy, service is far less than average and no manager is anywhere to be seen."}
{"text":"OMG! They really do have the best wings ever! I had to take a star off because the service was very slow. Our waitress was sweet, but came to our table three times before she remembered that we wanted water. But still, OMG, THE WINGS!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the outside, balcony area was awesome! However, the server came and checked our table maybe two times? My friend actually went to the counter for another beer.  Is there gonna be next visit? Doubtful, but my friend lives near so I hope she will take care of our table when we visit next time.  Food: Good Price: Good Service: N/A Parking: Good"}
{"text":"I keep trying to enjoy this place, but the service is awful. Doesn't matter what day or time. Never again."}
{"text":"Breaded wings were terrible.  Try plain or mild if you want breaded wings. Or simply try naked wings.   Great customer service.  That is why they are getting 4 stars.   Fresh salaries. Fries were okay."}
{"text":"I've not been there during the day but since am a night owl, I'll post it for the night shift. Around midnight  the place slows down a bit, but then the real night owls show up n the place is popping till sunrise. Yes the bartender makes a difference and Paul the graveyard guy makes the bar the spot to be at after dark. Full menu also is a plus."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. My service has always been good, but I always sit at the bar & not a section. People seem to forget this is Hooters, it's wings & women...I really don't see why people are expecting a 5 star dining experience. I can't understand the concept of bringing a family or small children to Hooters, it blows my mind.  Tips for you: -Wednesday are specials. all you can eat wings & $6.99 10 wings & fries. So this day will be busy. -Sit at the bar, service seems to be better & faster if your drinking. -If you like Latino women, this Hooters is for you.  Observations: -Average guy age 40, average Hooters girl age 21. -90% Latino crowd -Old guys hitting on young women (pretty entertaining to watch)"}
{"text":"Based on the service I just received at this hooters on rainbow it's a miracle these guys are still in business.  I was there tonight around 2:00 am. (Monday the 25th.)  The bar tender who was on staff was to busy drinking, and on his \"break\" to get our drink order prepared.  The one girl who was working had some attitude and didn't give us a heads up that the chef and bartender were on break so we waited for 90 minutes before getting our food order... We were the only table in the entire place. The drink order we had to cancel.  Once we finally got our order the chicken was overcooked and rubbery.   Living so close to this specific hooters location and being a gambler if the food and service was even decent I would come back often.... Only gambling I'll be doing there is waiting to see how sick I get from the terrible cooked wings i just had. I don't often Yelp but this experience was terrible and I thought I would let everyone know to stay away... If you want wings go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Durango, If you want to gamble & drink go to one of the other hundreds of gaming bars in town. Trust me STAY AWAY. It's not worth it.   Epic Fail... I'm embarrassed for taking my friends here and really feel this location gives a very negative name to all hooters. The manager, staff and whoever else is in charge should be ashamed of the lack of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"All I have to say was food was very crappy! I got my son the kids meal chicken strips with fries and let's just say I was scared to feed my son!! Chicken was skinny and gross looked like it was put into a microwave and was just re-heated! Wings are super hard and have NO MEAT."}
{"text":"If you could look up \"Doing It Wrong\" in the dictionary there would be a picture of the Uptown Hooters next to it.  A group of 9 of us (8 guys and me) went for a friend's birthday because they had ordered the UFC fight. The fact that even with the fight the place was half empty on a Saturday night should have said something, but we set in and ordered up food anD beers. Since we were a large group we were given two waitresses but they didn't coordinate so items we ordered kept not being entered. After the initial round of food all we were ordering was beer but even with an average order to table time of over 20 minutes we were still missing some pints (this may be because one of the waitresses said she was too young to serve beer so she had to relay the orders to a bartender who then forgot them).  You would think that after paying around a grand to be able to show the fight they would actually do so, and you would be wrong. They forgot to put it on until we reminded them and a few times switched the channel to King of Queens. When it was on, it was so low you couldn't hear, which was odd since it was the only thing our entire section was watching. Apparently the manager was the only one who could change it back and if I were him, after hearing one of the waitresses whine out my name at the top of her lungs every 5 minutes, I wouldn't be on my A game either. I feel sorry for you, David.  My bar for the food was low since it's Hooters (the breasts and thighs they specialize in aren't on a chicken). But even though I was drinking water, not beer, all night I still got sick later that night. Bar: not met.  So, bad service, lack of beer, poor fight showing, and questionable food. Yeah, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Staying in a nearby hotel on a business trip, decided some chicken wings would hit the spot.  I've found Hooters locations to be hit and miss lately.  They are either really good or really bad.  If you're looking for a good one (where they change the fry oil) this is one of them.  Greeted at the door and promptly seated.  My server Nelly was on her game and I had my wings in no time at all.  Food was well prepared, wings were nice sized and everything tasted fresh.  Manager stopped by to check on things and all was well.  Hoping this is a trend for Hooters to return to good food and great service.  See y'all next trip..!!"}
{"text":"Just swooped in the check the vibe... And was greeted by a very enthusiastic waitress named Rachel. She offered every seat in the house and catered to my choice of television seating(even if it wasn't in her section). Decided to sit in her section. Was a great decision. Her service was phenomenal! Was here to scout out a going away party for the evening. Will be back for sure! Thanks Rachel for the hospitality. Doing a great job! Keep it up! Don't under look this gem Hooter's! A great lady to have for your establishment! Thanks Rachel! Keep up the good work! Very appreciated!"}
{"text":"Ah, Hooters. I wonder why I saved you for my 400th review.  Home of lowered expectations, beige food that has been deep fried and stuffed with cheese, and drunk Manitoban ladies that will declare you are clearly batting for the other team if you don't find them attractive and don't want to buy them drinks.  Here's the thing, bars. I can't give you more money if the waitress refuses to do more than one lap around her station and therefore never refills my water, takes another drink order or any order. She did however, come back just as we were prepping to head out, and give us poutine that none of us ordered.  Someone at another table must've been hungry and sad."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon after a long drive from CA, love this location!! Tons of TV at the bar. My bartender  was Tiffany, she is tiny but she got some guns on her arms!!   I really like their new Chicken Bacon Ranch Melt sandwich they are really good. But I didn't like their sliders too much, glad I got the for free since I got a coupon from the email I got from them. I will be back whenever I m in town."}
{"text":"Girls were pretty. Food was good. Nothing special.  Had the original wings and fried pickles."}
{"text":"You know that terrible food at the arena/stadium that you have to eat?  ever wanted to have that in a restaurant?  if the answer is no then make sure to avoid Hooters because that is what you get."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar and it smells as in stinks like a toilet.  We mention it to the bartender and he says that management is aware of it. Sorry I couldn't even finish my beer and of course the hooters wings got neglected. Sad case of a neglected facility so many other choices in Vegas make a better one than I did."}
{"text":"Worst hooters EVER!! I do not know where to begin! We frequent hooters Scottsdale with very little issues this one is horrible!! Horrible service and management! Wrong size beer and the serve gave me a confused unapologetic look. Then when ordering a salad it came out with beyond rubber chicken. It could not even be cut and the wings only had half the sauce on them.  We never got our drinks refilled but the worst part was the bartender calling a customer d@@@ for his fries not being cooked to his standard of done! Then the whole staff proceeding to talk bad about a customer who comes in only drinking water and never tips he's a jerk don't worry about it etc etc. on top of all of this the manager just said I'll talk to them. The level of professionalism was very poor and my eleven year old heard all of this disrespect. No remorse or condolence for the food and service was offered!!!! Worse 50 spent! Do not go here ever!! Only gets a star since it has to :("}
{"text":"I came to get some breakfast and like always Hooters lived up to the expectation of great food and service. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was wrapped to perfection. I've came to eat here a few times and the staff is just amazing. Mitrisha is the sweetest bartender and she makes amazing drinks. Her and Jun work perfectly together tending to every guests needs and I had the pleasure of receiving service from them this morning again. Big thank you to them and the manager Mikey for making sure my overall visit was a success. I recommend coming here if going to or leaving from the airport since it's located right off Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the oysters which where pretty good. My fried tasted crispy but my sliders were overcooked as where my friends chicken he ordered. It was absurdly loud with all the men cheering and shouting each time some character ran to the other side of the field on their TV show. It's really hot here in Phoenix so apparently the uniform here is very heat driven. Had an ok time but they should turn down the TV or just turn it off. It makes the other customers go crazy."}
{"text":"Hoot-Hoot for Hooters!  I always preface reviews for chain restaurants by saying they should be taken with a grain of salt. This is of course because of a variety of factors that can change from location to location and it also depends on the variables in which the location is situated in. Case in point here with the Hooters inside the Palms Hotel & Casino, just off the strip in Las Vegas.  My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in Sin City and stayed at the aforementioned Palms Hotel & Casino. Yes, there are vast dining options in and around, however when a deal was found for the chain Hooters, we jumped on and decided to go for a late lunch break. This worked out very well for many reasons. The sum it up though, the food, the drink and the service, were all spot on.  The restaurant is nicely tucked in, yet spreads out to the grand casino floor of the Palms, and so you can waltz right in after you hit the Jackpot! Ha! Once greeted by the friendly staff, the open concept of the dining area will feel vast and cozy, all together. Once seated, our server quickly came by with menus and drink options for days. We each had an adult beverage that came with a generous pour - always a good thing.  For our lunch, we each had a chicken sandwich, though prepared differently and equally enjoyed as was made to perfection. I opted for a grilled patty with veggies on the side and my wife had French fries. Again, all was cooked to perfection and tasted great. For lunch, this hit the spot.  At the end of the meal, we were able to relax and not stress out with any aspect, as some times, especially when it comes to deals and promotions, the servers are less than ready to made good. This was not the case at this Hooters and our server was just fantastic. I would recommend this spot all the way and would stop in again when in Vegas, baby!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 5:15pm. Our waitress was Aliah and she was really nice! I ordered the 10 pc. original Hooters wings with honey chipotle sauce. The wings were just ok."}
{"text":"Service let me say has not been great most times we go, but a to-go order of wings never hurts anyone.  Enjoying the lemon pepper wings for sure and the other flavors are good enough.  We haven't spent many times dining in, but overall we have been happy with the food.  Still wish Wing Stop was closer, but this works for now."}
{"text":"I'm 67 years old and they wouldn't serve my wife or i because we didn't have our id's with us. They have crappy wings anyway."}
{"text":"Hot Hooters! Need I say more? I'd come here any day over the ones in NYC."}
{"text":"Wings late, told that more blue cheese would be $1, wing warm not hot, got ranch not blue cheese. This was at the bar not the restaurant. Highly do not recommend."}
{"text":"I do takeout almost every Wednesday for the boneless wing platter day. By the time I get home my food is still hot and fresh (just the way I like it). It always has the right amount of crunch and sauce. To me, their wings are better than Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Hooters the girls are hot and friendly (working on that tip) and the food is bar food! But it's good! If you have not heard of Hooters than you must be Mormon or Amish."}
{"text":"Yes, I realize Hooters is Hooters, but it had been awhile since I've been to one and I was conveniently staying at the Sheraton across the street.  Plus starving after a delayed flight, needing dinner bad.  The reason I rank this location with 5 stars is my server, Amelia. She was a breath of fresh air -- very genuinely gracious and down to earth as well as attentive.  I really appreciated comfort food (well yeah, wings and fries) in a relaxed atmosphere. given the hectic day.  The \"old\" Hooters would have been a bit patronizing based on past experiences; Amelia was awesome!!!  I'll be back in January.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"We are quickly becoming regulars here. The patio is always nice even when it's 100 out due to the great misters and nice seating. Service is always great and they actually have a couple great healthy menu options now, the shrimp and spinach salad is probably one of the best salads I've ever  had! Lots of good beers on tap as well!"}
{"text":"Really bad food. Made me sick after I ate it. The burgers were cold & fries & onion rings all served cold. We even sent stuff back & came out luke warm. Good service but no drink refills were offered. Don't waste your time. It was the only thing open at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon. Too bad. Don't bother eating here."}
{"text":"Anyone wishing to patronize this establishment should just go to any \"gentleman's\" club nearby. They'd probably receive better treatment and food than here."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars because of Amanda and Markus! Amanda is my favorite bartender, always so friendly and accommodating and Markus was helpful in trying to fix our lack of star. Why would you have an advertisement tv in the middle of the bar?!!! We come here to watch sports. Please move the advertising elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty standard run-of-the-mill Hooters, except you know...Vegas lol.  That said, you know what you're getting when you're coming here.  Food is same ol same ol.  Wings are to be expected, can't ever go wrong with that.  Definitely a good spot to come here to watch UFC PPVs if that's on your mind."}
{"text":"Hooters has gone downhill.  Especially this location. The problem is that it is always dirty.  They are nice and friendly but not very effective.  Still a good place to get a drink but I wouldn't trust anything in the kitchen. If they leave a crazy mess out in the open I can only imagine what the inside kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"I love going to this Hooters. The Hooters girls are awesome and very attentive. Erica is the best!!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!!!!   Came here for the weekend and I regret it horribly!!!  First of all, this place needs to take care of its appearance!!!  It's HOOTERS for god's sake!!!  Make it look and feel like one!!!!   Second...  The rooms are OK, but the showers suck!!!  I went to take a shower and the shower only has 2 settings!!!  SCOLDING HOT or WINTER!!!!!  No inbetween!!!!  Not only that, but the water pressure is non existent!!!  It's worse than an old man's dribble!!!  I will not stay here ever again..."}
{"text":"I'm actually still sitting and eating right now.    I got the free 10 boneless wings for my birthday so I figured, why not give it a try.    They seated me pretty fast, within about 2 minutes of arrival.   The waitress is nice and attentive.   Not sure of her name but I'll check it out next time she comes to give me another soda which she brings me a refill on before I'm even done with it.   I mostly come to a place to eat for the food, the service doesn't matter to much to me unless it's really terrible.   But with this waitress today, it's quality.  The boneless wings are really subpar.   About 90% breading.  They are too crunchy and then the chicken is tough.  The garlic Parmesan sauce is very unappealing.   I can't really describe it other than not good and I don't recommend you order it.  I just got Buffalo Wild Wings a few days ago and their sauce and quality is about 7,000 times better.   The hot boneless wings are a little better but still not good.   Overall, for the $8 it's gonna cost for the drink, free wings and a tip, it's certainly not worth it.  I honestly don't think I'd pay anything for this food.  I feel like I just wasted calories by just eating fried breading.  I like some chicken with my boneless chicken and there none here to speak of.   I won't be back.   Not even for my free wings next year."}
{"text":"Okay, so the service isn't that great.  And okay the chicken wings are just so-so (I love the breaded 911 wings, so I like the wings, just seems many of my friends don't.  All that squacking aside, you still can't beat the location of Tempe Hooters, or the spirit and energy of the local peeps.  Are the girls the hottest of all Hooters girls no, but you still can't beat the whole thing all put together.  It's a good time.  When you are done, go up one floor to the rooftop and check that out.  Tell em Attorney Steve sent ya!"}
{"text":"The wings are meh. BWWs is better and that's not saying much. Our waitress is a complete dingbat. Orders took forever and one of my wings was pea sized. I will nit be back."}
{"text":"Call before you go...  I'm pretty sure this location is closed down for good..."}
{"text":"Management sucks...messed up my money and had a hair in my drink. Too much to explain, just really annoyed by my visit. The waitresses, poor management, and lack  of caring for customers made my  visit horrible. I made a call to their hotline after being brushed off by the manager...such a shame :(. I'd give this place less than one star if I could."}
{"text":"Walked in, sign said \" seat yourself\" so we did. 15% of the place was occupied. Acouple girls said, seat yourself. So we is. 20 minutes later, we still had no service. Buffalo Wild Wings, here we come"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since the 90s and was always great. Until this evening. Stacy is a terrible server. She needs more training or something. Arrived at 6pm and received our beers promptly. Never saw her again. At 6:40 we had empty glasses and no food so we asked for our check. She made a crap excuse and no apology. She gave me the check again no apology or thanks for coming or anything. The manager I think even came to apologize. He was nice about it and offered to box our food but we had to go. I did leave Stacy a tip for our drinks but when we come back I will definitely refuse to be waited on by her."}
{"text":"We do have a really big party in the back room & it is unlimited wing night so the dining room is packed. It's a bad experience to wait 1+ hours to get your food. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Worst hooters I have been to. We sat down waited to get serviced but they just kept passing by. Once it passed the ten minute mark we stayed their just to see if the would acknowledge us. Well they didn't. We got up told the manager we were there roughly 22 minutes and walked out. Please if you come in a group avoid this place. Go down the street to Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"Ribs and Fries: huge amount of food, great taste, excellent price as the day's Special!"}
{"text":"Overrated for some unknown reasons. But it's good to find a spot when it's too busy everywhere else on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Seems that Hooters was really good when I went 10 years ago, but when I went today, it was just mediocre. Service ok. Food ok. Ambiance ok. Nothing particularly special, but nothing necessarily wrong. I'll probably wait another 10 years before returning..."}
{"text":"It's a Hooters so you should know what to expect. Happy hour special was $3.25 bud and bud lights. Didn't make me too happy but maybe the higher prices were just a Toronto thing. Waitress was pretty but rather inattentive. Boneless wings and fries were fine, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer said keep driving in aid of this, this Hooters is no more, it is now a used car dealership."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Hooters before I discovered better options for eating a ridiculous amount of chicken wings inexpensively.  I visited this fine establishment after quite a big hiatus and was pleasantly surprised to find a) better, larger wings b) $2 budweiser bottles Service wasn't bad, either, we didn't have to wait very long for anything. I'm not sure what the deal was with the cheap beer, but it sure made me happy."}
{"text":"The best Hooters hands down. The food is always hot and fast. The fried pickles are the best that I've had at any Hooters. We stopped in at 7 am after being up all night. They gave us a breakfast menu but you can order from the regular menu at any time, so we did. 10 boneless wings and fried pickles. The food was excellent and the waitress, Amanda, was nice and attentive. We'll be back in town in April and this will be a stop on our itinerary!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars! Stopped here last night as one of our bar hopping spots for a bachelor party. Place was dead. Unfortunately for my friend (bachelor), the bartender flagged him right away when he tried to order a beer. She told him......I don't think you need anymore to drink and wouldn't serve him. We did order food though. An order of wings and chicken sandwich. Half hour later and we still have not received anything. My buddy is trying to get the bartenders attention saying excuse me ms.. I saw her look at him through the corner of her eyes and she completely ignored him. I than tried getting her attention calling for her but she completely ignored me. She walked right by me a few feet away when she ignored me. She comes by again and another guy with us got her to stop and told her we would like our orders to go now. It's now an hour later and still no food. People who showed up half hour after us are getting plates of food. So we're like what the fuck is going on? How long does it take to get an order of wings and a chicken sandwich. The bachelor who has been waiting for his wings for an hour now and who couldn't get a beer. Is irritated and I'm getting pissed. Rightfully so. So he yells to the bartender standing across the bar to get her attention and asks what is going on with our food! She says......it's coming. We waited another 5 min and said fuck this. Threw $5 down for a soda and couple waters and we walked out. So unfortunately the left over change i did not get back for the soda. Which was now i guess left for a tip and the bartender who was a cunt didnt deserve it. This place is a dump, service is absolutely horrible. The girls working here look like where the island of misfit toys go to. I highly recommend to steer away from this place. This city is LOADED with bars that are a thousand times better."}
{"text":"This was our fallback, since the location we were planning to go to (The Corner Bakery) decide to close early (5 PM) on the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend...DA what is up with that . Anyway food was good but service was very slow because of the Comic Con Convention as well as Mercury and DBacks games...but overall was very satisfied with Hooters."}
{"text":"Terrible wings and service was not great. Waste of money the waitress was nowhere to be found anytime we needed anything.  Also she was too busy rubbing her stomach to pay attention to her customers!  NEVER AGAIN HOOTERS!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is very friendly and the wings are delicious! The '83 Margarita for $5 is delicious :)"}
{"text":"\"Quick eats\"  Yep, that sums it up. You go to hooters and you kinda know what to expect. I find that hooters centered around campuses have less service then others.. and this locay is no exception. This place is also kinda interesting. They have tables but really low seats and some tables with high stools. The restaurant feels hodge podge in the back.. so opt for a table in the front.  Go for the wings and to watch some games. Worry less about the service and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"It's hooters. What do you really expect? Being a gay man I just wanted chicken wings Togo after a long night of work. Took forever for my food - shame on me for not checking my order. When I got home I had garlic cheese chicken? Not mild Buffalo wings.. next time I'm hungry after working the late shift.. McDonalds it is."}
{"text":"Maybe I am biased because the hooters near where we live is quite nice and this one is just near an airport... But wow that was bad.  Got to the hotel late and literally went to the nearest open place to eat. Went to the bathroom before the meal came and almost lost my appetite right then and there... All but 1 of the toilets were overflowing and also reeked. Then when I went to wash my hands there were no towels and also \"to go\" boxes of wings on the counter... Which the smell from that was just so wrong mixing with the other smells of the bathroom.  Anyway I just ordered the buffalo dip for myself and that ended up being fine. My husband on the other hand got a mushroom burger and took one bite then spit it out... He just ate his fries instead. I didn't try it and he wasn't super specific other than it tasted bad but I was hoping it didn't have anything to do with sanitary or food safety conditions. They did take it off our order so that was nice of them. No complaints about the wait staff other than maybe they should check the bathrooms on occasion to see if it has gotten out of hand..."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service.  First off they took 10 min just to get us drinks.  I had ordered a beer to which Jenna asked for my ID.  When I pulled it out to show her she just barely glanced at it as she walked by.  Then I asked her to put my alcohol on a separate tab because I cannot expense it.  She rolled her eyes at me and said sure like it was a major deal.  We ordered our food which was wings, and pretzel bite. 45 min later wings come out cold and pretzel bites look like pieces of charcoal.  This is not the first time service has been bad. From now on I'll eat at Buffalo Wild Wings or Native grille.   Jenna hope you enjoy the 3.50 tip on a 60.00 bill.  Change your attitude and maybe you will walk out of there with more than 80.00 in tips.  Ps I overheard heard someone walked out on a 350 tab...maybe the reason why was your attitude!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to stop by after work for a quick bite and beers. They have many monthly beer specials.   Mariah our bartender took great care of us. She was very friendly and quick to get us what we needed."}
{"text":"Just like every other Hooters, they are a chain you know haha  Food: Still love their wings nonspicy.  I can't handle anymore, yeah I know I'm weaksauce.    Service: Lady was awesome, very nice & courteous.  After dinner we stayed for awhile to chit chat and she was totally fine with us just chilling there... well there wasn't anyone around any table anyways.  Atmosphere:  I mean if you're in the area, theres plenty more other places to go but of course it'll be crowded & unsure they'll be serving food at night... i mean real food not snack/bar food.  Not crowded.  Parking: BOy will you have trouble.  Same parking as everyone else's trying to get to so they can walk around the popping area."}
{"text":"Love coming to hooters,metro location is my favorite place to be the beers are ice cold and all the girls are gorgeous!:)"}
{"text":"Look, men don't go to Hooters for the food.  We go to Hooters to stare at hot girls and to flirt with them.  Of course it helps if the waitstaff is friendly.  I've been to this Hooters location 3 or 4 times and only once did I have a friendly waitress, who sat with me and chatted with me for a bit.  The other times, I was pretty much ignored by my waitress, who took my food order, brought out my food, and gave me my check, all without any chatting, conversation, or visiting my table to flirt.  I mean, I can go to any bar in town for that.  I go to Hooters because I want a cute girl in a skin tight outfit to pretend that she's into me.  That's part of the appeal.  After being ignored the last couple of times I haven't gone back."}
{"text":"The wings are overpriced. The food was pretty good! Our service was great. Our waitress Delicia was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Because I couldn't sleep at the hotel next door ( America's best which I just wrote a bad review for ) I thought that maybe splurging a little on wings would turn things around. It didn't. It made things worse. I'll just say overall that every girl here is really kind of introverted and droning around doing their job like it was just like any other job. And, although I don't really condone that girls should need to be extra flirtatious in order to keep the job, there's a difference to being nice and being slutty. These girls were neither. All of the girls look so serious and were very boring. Sure they looked good but I kind of thought that the whole point of 15 dollars for 10 wings wasn't just for the \"amazing\" flavors, I can now get the same at 7-11 and they aren't even a fraction of the price. Two beers and a tip and I just dropped 40 bucks. Without even a smile from a single girl. I mentioned my other review because it was kind of related and the only reason I thought I could salvage a bad night. When I used to go to Hooters long ago, my friends and I went to cheer us up. These girls were more like dominatrix type which is not what I was in the mood for. Really disappointing. To top it off, I went into the very small slot area thinking that maybe that would be a way to save my night. Another 60 that went faster then I could count it and I don't think I'll ever come back for anything here. Really nothing good here not to mention that the room prices have skyrocketed. This was my original choice for a room but their prices went from around 27 bucks a few years ago to over 100 for regular price.   Same thing...I will recommend all of my savage friends to go here. This place is garbage"}
{"text":"If you go there, go for the Girls, wings and burgers.  The rest of the food is pretty marginal. My pet peeve there is they bring out the sauces in the little vacuum sealed cups that you get at Jack in the Box or McDonald's, (come on this is a restaurant cant they make fresh ranch)??? It is a sports bar to and drink beer and watch sports,chat up the waitresses and watch sports on one of the many TVs.... dont go there expecting much more ."}
{"text":"I can almost always appreciate an upbeat and beautiful woman in and environment involving beer and wings. Since I was hungry and in the area, I called to preorder some wings. I found out that you have to physically come in to order, which I totally understood. Very pleasant greeting as I was directed to the lovely Ms. Keysha to take my to go order. Excellent customer service and studious to boot. I can appreciate that when I mentioned that the price she gave me differed from the price on the official website, she offered the servitude to make sure I was met with satisfaction. That's the type of customer service I can appreciate. Atmosphere in this place is not overly radical, and not boringly calm. Perfect balance. I'll update once I get my wings if they're subpar, but if this is the end of this review then that means my hands were messy and my mouth is full. Happy dining."}
{"text":"Oh Hooters, I hate having to give you three stars but tonight you were only a three star establishment. We came in around 10:15 to meet up with a couple of friends and hang out and chat and eat some food. We were told to seat ourselves. It took about 10 minutes, maybe more, for us to be greeted and when we were it wasn't by a waitress. Our waitress was cute, don't get me wrong, but she had absolutely no personality. Aren't they supposed to sit and flirt and banter with tables? I know I'm a female but there were three strapping young lads next to me and we didn't even get a smile. I'd recommend going to happy hour here. Drafts are $2 and a couple of the appetizers are half off. I don't know if I'd go again if it wasn't happy hour though."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 people. I made a reservation more than a week in advance. When we got there 10 minutes in advance and they could not find it. Finally, we got a table.  We went for the unlimited wings Monday. First thing we got told, it is not available. Fine. We'll get somehing else.  We waited for OVER 1 HOUR AND A HALF before asking what was going on. The waitress did not even seem to remember we were there. We asked to see the manager twice before he finally came.  He told us that it was written in the reservation email that this deal was not available, which is a big fat lie.  Finally, the waitress told us it \"happened often\". Nice. You guys could do something about it maybe?  ALL the tables around us had time to be served, eat, PAY AND LEAVE before we even got our plates.  When we decided to leave after 1 hour 45 minutes, some food started to show up. A friend who joined us about 30 minutes after we arrived got his food first. He had time to finish before we got the second plate, in which the fries were cold.  We then got our main course. The appetizers came when we were halfway done and honestly, we weren't even hoping to see them anymore. One of these appetizers came when we were all done eating.  Finally, the manager told us he was going to \"take care of the bill\". This resulted in a laughable 20% off.  Well Hooters, here's the thing: big boobs aren't everything. The waitresses were obviously undertrained and overwhelmed. And just because you tell someone he is the manager does not make him competent.  Never again."}
{"text":"This is a late night review.... we rolled in around 11pm and the good news is that they serve food 24 hours... the bad news is our waitress appeared to hate her job....  It was pretty disappointing as I have been to many hooters in my day...   their wings are amazing.... 10, breaded all drums mild with bleu cheese... usually works out awesome....     the food was great, the service ruined it... maybe if you go during normal day time hours you will have better luck!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place but the last few times I visited this establishment I was severely disappointed. I am a close neighborhood gaming/restaurant bartender and I recently moved areas but my best friend lives across the road of Hooters so I have recommended coming here since I live their special non-breaded wings but I ordered a Cadillac Margarita and tasted only sweet & sour. I didn't see her put the Gran Marnier so I asked how she made it. It's one of their signature cocktails and her answer was \"oh I don't know let me look for it\". Wow ok so I'm paying $10 for an incorrect drink. Sorry I'm a stickler on margaritas because my standards are high as a Vegas bartender.   The second time I decided to give them another try because I love the graveyard bartender but I cannot come in during that time so we had lunch and the young girl server had 3 tables. Our 2 top, another 2 top, and 3 top. I've ran a full bar and 4 tables all by myself and she couldn't even serve us in a timely manner whatsoever. I saw a manager I've never seen before just running food and the girls dripped a ranch trail all over the floor, then she took 15 after she brought our water to ask if we wanted a DRINK. We got 2 specialty drinks which with 8 ppl at the gaming bar, I'm shocked it took her that long for those. She arrived & as she placed the drinks down she mumbled \"that was an ordeal\". Wow, so she put in our food order and then when she dropped the check it took her almost 20 min to come get the $, & she came by with mouth FULL OF FOOD which explains why it took her so long to pick up our $ and said \"I'll be right back with your change\".   Seriously, finish your food before you touch a table. It's just unprofessional and unsanitary that I no longer want to eat or drink there. I'm very taken back how the service is there. I worked in that neighborhood for 3 years and I worked so hard to accommodate guests & it just frustrates me when I see people not respect their jobs or customers. With so many bars & restaurants opening, I would be very picky on who I hire and as a manager, touch the waitresses tables to ensure their guests are satisfied. It just seems like common sense. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"After a day of enjoying Toronto, the weather...45° and great food in town we needed a beer and something casual. So returning to the Airport Marriott in our Uber I look right and see Hooters 5 blocks from the Hotel!! Score  It was now raining and we moved out fast to get in doors. Clean, and surprisingly empty.  Elizabeth our server was fantastic. After wine and beers we jumped into wings. I went 3mile island and tried the new Gen Tso's ---- nice bite and tasty.  Never thought there would be a Hooters in Canada - Am I glad !   Great Hooters quality in food and people.   Will we come back: It's Hooters - YES!!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is pretty dead on Sundays.  I was staying at the hotel across the street.  There was also a dance competition there.  All the dance moms and the kids swarmed every restaurant that did happen to still be open (there weren't many).  I headed to Hooters.  My hunch was right: none of the dance moms and kiddos were there!  Got a ceasar salad and some sliders to go.  Very average.  Not terrible.  Not great.  Slightly overpriced.  I usually like the wings at Hooters.  Maybe I should have stuck with that choice."}
{"text":"Buy wings get double for free on Tuesday!  i remember going to a hooters for the first time. a time in my life when the mere glance at boobage brought me to my seat... well cus you know a young guy with a boner isnt socially acceptable.  wings and girls in revealing shorts and shirts. what young college guy wouldnt want to go.  its been years since ive been and have to say the wings are smaller but still have a lot of breading on them.  they were ok.  had one of their craft beers. i forgot the name but it had apricot in it. was good. surprisingly light.  there are other better places for wings, but those places dont have as nearly as many boobages."}
{"text":"My brother and I went there to eat on Friday the 26th of Feb before the Megadeth concert.  Since we are somewhat religious and Catholic, we opted for the fried fish sandwich.  That was a mistake.  The fish tasted \"fishy\" and the breading (which was very greasy) was falling off as well as the fish just falling apart.  We couldn't eat it as a sandwich, had to eat with a fork and we didn't even finish it.  There were no spices or even salt on it and the tartar sauce was very very bland.  I realize they just opened recently, but if they don't get their act together, they won't be open for very long.  Maybe the chicken and burgers are better, but be warned - stay away from the fish...."}
{"text":"Well, I love Hooters wings when done the way I like - this Hooters does not listen to you during the take out call.  Asked for extra crispy wings; got extra soggy!  I know you get what you pay for, but there are far better wings in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It second time going too this Hooters and really not that big on Hooters. Had my old roommate in town and looking place for lunch with rest of my hockey family get together some beers conversations food. I think the whole catch Hooters not that fun anymore. Really the food ok nothing special just your normal bar food. I admit somewhat of fan of the chicken wings. I got the boneless chicken wings this time with the cajun seasonings. The seasonings was ok but hindsight should have stuck with tradition hot, medium, or mild sauce. The chicken itself was friend nice crispy on the outside and chicken nice moist on the inside. I had burgers there before there ok. Really think the food is ok overall."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative reviews I would. Wings cooked in old grease with too much batter and stale sauce. One of the worst meals I have ever eaten., And expensive to boot. We will never be back, but I suggest everyone else stay away too. Headed home and immediately began eating Tums"}
{"text":"Wife found stones in her burger, manager mentioned its the grill resedue. Very dissapointed, beer was flst too. Ordered fries which came rae W, sent it back and it never came back again. Would not recommed this location for healt and hygine reasons"}
{"text":"Ladies were nice but terrible service. There were about 20 of them gawking around with an empty restaurant yet i still had to wait extremely long for service.  I try to be kind with reviews, but frankly I would not come here.  There was also weird hair in my food."}
{"text":"It was really busy during my experience at Hooters, but the waitress was still quick with her service and was really friendly. She kept checking up on our tables regularly, but not too much to the point it was annoying. She kept our beers refilled and our waters refilled as well.  Hooters has classic wings, and most of them are saucey. They have a lot of screens and this is probably one of the coolest places to watch a game because of the food, plenty of screens, and of course, the beautiful waitresses."}
{"text":"4 out of 6 of us had wings here over the past weekend and ended up with food poisoning. Everything from food to service was terrrrrible. Guess I should have read the yelp reviews before coming. Don't waste your time with this place, it's a shit show literally"}
{"text":"Ended up going here on randomly on a week night with a coworker...this hooters in very spacious which I like I didn't like how I had to finish my drink before I went in but I understood why....got to sit at the bar waitress was friendly and engaging normally at big food chains you taste something once it pretty much the say at all other locations but the old Bay wings and Lemmon pepper wing were amazing folks here didn't drown the chicken in the seasoning the food didn't come out fast as it probably normal would because of how many customer there were but I'll definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Watch your bill.  We came in for a couple drinks during happy hour. We ordered them as \"Vodka/Redbull and Whiskey/Coke\". They were served quickly and tasted fine. When the check came we found that our Waitress had decided to up-sell us without asking. When I brought it to her attention, she said, \"OH Sorry, hehe\"  UPDATE: I called the manager, Kim, shortly after this review and was pleased with the results of our conversation. Since the Up-sale was really the only issue, giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the UFC fight since I was staying at Palms Place for a conference. Front desk staff was so helpful and nice. We were immediately say at the nicest bartender (thanks Tiffany) greeted us instantly. Of course this being my first time she was so sweet and answered all of my dumb questions with a smile"}
{"text":"Been here many many times over the years, since this is the only stand alone Hooters location in town. If you've been to any Hooters location before, you know you come for the girls, wings and beer. Everything else on the menu is meh. Service here is mediocre too and even worse if you come when it's busy like during lunch rush or a night where they're running a special...then all service goes out the door.  I've always loved the breaded \"hot\" wings which are not really too hot - good, because I'm not a big spicy food eater. I recently discovered Daytona style wings here and it has become my new favorite! Daytona style is their non-breaded, or \"naked\" wings, that are sauced and then finished on the grill. Costs $1 more per order but it's well worth it because it has a lot more flavor.  Surprisingly it doesn't get too crowded here on game nights, unless it's something major like March Madness. As long as they're not also running some kind of BOGO or AYCE special then it's a pretty quiet place to chill and watch sports."}
{"text":"Food was decent, waiter was abysmal at most, messed up our orders a lot, and I didn't understand the bringing out our sides first before the main course? Just created a bigger mix-up"}
{"text":"Ya.  It's Hooters.  Cleaner than most.  Often slightly better than McDonalds.  Loaded Tater Tots are made to go with beer.  Ya... umm...  definitely a fan of the service staff.  I mean... that's the point, right?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch this week.  Ordered a burger, hold all onions, tator tots instead of fries.   My burger arrives, with fries, and an explanation of we are out of tots are fries ok?  Well, its kind of late now!  I was very pleasant with the server as she seemed genuinely concerned with the issue.   I have a few fries, yuck. Worst fries ever.  So soggy they might have been cooked in luke warm oil.   Still in an acceptable mood i pull the bun off my burger to add ketchup and mustard.  Imagine my surprise to find a lot of onions on my burger.  The server removed the burger from the check.  This is expected but the money is not the issue.   If i order a meal i expect it to arrive as ordered.  Yes, the cook missed the instructions but it is the responsibility of the server to verify it is right before delivering it to the customer.  Also, if an item is unavailable the customer should be informed before any substitutions are made. In this case i would have changed my entire order had i known the tots were unavailable.  This is not the first poor experience i have had at this place but it is certainly the last.   Good luck!  Twin Peaks has better service, better food, and better servers!"}
{"text":"This location is always a hit or miss (but mostly a miss). The service is usually mediocre and the food always comes out as if they have snails making our food. I don't know if they need more services or more kitchen staff but it's always the same problem. However, when the food eventually makes it out it's usually hot and correct. If your going to watch the game and get a drink, then this is a good spot uptown, but can get pretty packed."}
{"text":"Review is for the restaurant;  Since you removed the restaurant that had the prime rib, anyone staying here for business is likely to eat at the Hooter's bar/diner thing.  Not a problem;  but you seem to have cut the portion size down to something only the 99 lb. Hooter's waitresses would feel sated on!    Seriously;  my chicken wings were like the dregs of what should have been at the bottom of a pan, I received like 3 decrepit pieces of celery, and my spinach shrimp salad had like 5 bay size shrimp...??  Come on.  This is Vegas, land of excess.  We're not supposed to feel hungry when we leave.  On the plus side;  staff is very friendly, clam chowder was great."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat down at the restaurant, ordered our food and after we got our order we were never checked up. Never saw our waitress till I had to search for her to give us the check. Will never repeat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hooters in Vegas.  Great place to watch the game or fight. I always sit at the bar and the bartenders are fun.  Food is always good and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week,  and always Sunday .  Have no interest in fight tonight just some dinner and leave. Which we said we would be gone before fight and said we would sit outside .  This Hooters doesn't have good service on a regular day, worst when it's a event.  But to charge 20 cover charge per person  is ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"First time I have ever been to a Hooters. Not what I expected. Nice ambience for this type of place. Great looking and friendly girls if that's what you're into. Great service and very attentive. Pleasantly surprised. The food actually tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"I was Downtown Phoenix for a Convention and stop by Hooters for a quick drink. Jennifer the bartender absolutely is the best bartender in Phoenix - exceptional service. I recommend if you come in make sure she's working"}
{"text":"Don't go here!  Burnt wings, moldy lettuce underneath and horrible customer service.  You have been warned!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this review is for 75th Avenue/Thomas locationin West Ridge,  it will always be West Ridge to those who have lived here that long.  Please cook the wings long enough so that they are not raw inside and how dare you charge 50 cents for ranch,  could see your point if you gave one ranch per order of wings sold but to expecct us to just pay extra for dipping sauce is just wrong.  It is bad enough that we have buy celery and carrots!  I don't go to the 3rd St. location anymore, I don't believe I should have to pay so much to park in the garage.  I used to do a movie or two,  eat at Hooters and shop all in one day or evening but now that the parking is so high,  I haven't been to Arizona Center in two years.  I would take the light rail but that is almost as much as the parking.  These things just give Hooters an ugly name."}
{"text":"This place is so close yet I don't go very often.  It's sort of a special occasion place if you will.  It's not like they have the healthiest food in the world so deep fried chicken wings for me at least is something I have to take in as a special occasion.  I love their wings I can't lie.  They are greasy because they are buttery and I like the variety of sauces they have even though 99 times out of 100 I will end up getting the Buffalo on the hot side and even add more hot sauce to them.    I like them breaded instead of naked because I like them crunchy and they end up just being \"bigger\".  Again not the best thing to eat but a once in a while treat.   The deep fried pickles from here are a MUCH smaller serving size than many of the other Hooters establishments I've been to which were all in the US and even the one in Edmonton has a larger serving.    Anyway I take it for granted I have this place so close to me but it's like one of those \"I can but I don't want to\" instead of \"I can't\" go to places.  It's nice to know they are nearby when I have the need to go but I don't very often.  Mentally I associate this place with my youth and travel within the USA especially Florida where I've been to a bunch down there and where it all started way back in the day."}
{"text":"bad service, the manager lacks education, we miss the place without reason"}
{"text":"It's a hooters and it lived up to that. I had the mahi tacos and one was enough for me, I don't know how people eat three - the portions seem large. But everything tasted good and as hooters food normally does. Fried pickles were great. They accommodated my four year old with grilled chicken chunks instead of fried chicken strips and our waitress was super nice and friendly to our daughter. I appreciate that always."}
{"text":"I'm visiting first time from the states and my cousins took me down town to the infamous \"crescent\" st. I saw a hooters and said let's check it out. The set up and atmospher here in Montreal is awesome. All the girls were great here at this Hooters!!! I spoke with the manager Mark who was great and let him know the girl who did the meet and table seating up front Vivian B. Was outstanding with her great smile and personality. Then the girl who was serving us was extremely pleasant with a sense of humor to complement the great service Marie A. When I return I hope to see these ladies again! Love it"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, last night I witnessed the manager or GM fire a new girl in front of the entire restaurant, look her up and down and LAUGH, and then tell her that they have more attractive waitresses than her and she can leave. In front of the entire restaurant. It was awful. I felt so bad for her. It makes me wonder how they treat their other waitresses. Just a damn shame. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Probably one of my fav wing places. The 'Hooters Original Style' wings are to die for! The texture and the size of the wings are amazing. Can't get enough of them.   Our server seemed as if she was still new or still in training as she kept saying \"...hmm I haven't tried that one yet\" and \"I'll ask someone in the back for you\".  Nothing wrong with being new, in fact she was great! She was very friendly and had a great personality.   I ordered the Daytona Beach and Garlic Parm sauce on the side. For those of you who like a good smokey, chipotle,  bar-b-que flavour with a kick, Daytona Beach is for you.  I also really like the Garlic Parm sauce as it had an incredible buttery with a hint of garlic and parmesan.  I'm definitely going to come back and try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"So here is the deal. We fined here last night. When seated we were told that it was happy hour and went through the drink specials. Ok. We were trying to kill time and had a gift card sho why not? Hooters.always seems to give us amnesia. We always think hmmm. Hooters sounds awesome let's go, since we forgot just how bad it was last time. So this time I can at least say we had prompt service... which as you know is impossible unless you look like the type of a twenty to thirty something male who is a sucker for Orange booty shorts. Either way, it was quick.... almost suspiciously so for Hooters. We were killing time as I said so we started with the lots o tots. Crappy and oddly delicious as usual. Then we ordered a twenty piece boneless wings. Umm heres the deal.... what came out again suspiciously fast was not anything that resembled chicken. What we consumed actually treated nothing of poultry or even greasy saucy battered crispness. Nay, what we.managed to consume was cold, stale, probably reheated several times, broke my tooth, was hacked into tiny pieces, and literally splintered in your mouth. It cut the roof of my.mouth to hell. This is quite literally one of the worst meals I've ever had ... ever. (And if you knew my.father in laws cooking that says a lot). We actually left instead of continuing to order more food (we didn't even use up the gift card balance) on the way out we noticed that there was a sign for all you can eat wings. This irked me for two reasons 1. If I would have known that prior to actually tasting my did, I would have ordered it. 2. That was probably the reason or did was so awful. They probably.Just.make pieces hacked up.and let than sit until used.   So the next time you have Hooters amnesia, make sure it's not on a wednesday for all you can eat wood chips."}
{"text":"Service is good. This place is opened super early and super late. It might even be 24/7  Anyway I arrived on a Saturday around 5pm. I purchased a groupon hotel deal which came with $10 in food credit.  No lines. Quickly seated. Service was good too.   Ordered the fried zucchini. The zucchini itself was ok but the sauce made it tolerable. Spicy with some zing to it. My zucchini was very soggy after 5 min tho. Not really worth getting. I don't think I'd get this next time. 3/10   Ordered 10 piece hot wings. Garlic Parmesan. Not breaded and with bone in. First bite was great. The other 9 pieces were lacking flavor and sucked though. Dry and felt like it was microwaved. 3/10  This place charges 99 cents for ranch! What the heck? At least tell me beforehand!!  Anyway is average stuff you can get anywhere. Only went here because of the food credit. Wish the chicken had more of the sauce on it because it was totally lacking."}
{"text":"The service here is always a hit or miss. Never consistent. The chicken wings are small, I actually call them pigeon wings LOL I usually get their buffalo shrimp and a salad because I can get way better wings elsewhere.  Good location and the place is always clean. Good place to watch fights just make sure you get there early!!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had. It was obvious upon sitting at the bar that the location was understaffed. The bar was messy but it became ultra clear when \"Bre\" the bartender came over with her hands full and said \"I'm sorry you have to give me a couple minutes I'm really behind\" we told her it was ok and to take her time. Meanwhile she washed some dishes and told us of a bar crawl that put her so far behind - I am a former server/bartender with 12 years experience, she could've been taking our order while doing this instead of complaining about her night. Several minutes later, she came back to take our order. After this, she made not 1, but 3 trips back to us. 1 to drop the check, 1 to drop a water, 1 to drop my cocktail... would've saved her 60 seconds if she did all these things at once - think of all the time she's wasted all night not consolidating her steps! No wonder she's behind!! Our check was printed - time stamped 8:40 pm... come 9:08 pm we still hadn't received our app, so I saw the manager - \"Darrel\" at the service bar. I asked him his name and if he was the manager, pointed out that we waited for 28 minutes for an app and he quickly proceeded to help us. Wonderful our app came and he said our other food was ready. Then they say that only 1/2 lb crab was made and that the other 1/2 would be right out.... 20 minutes later, I asked Bre to have Darrel come back out - at this time he's walking around the dining room on his cell phone. Bre is at this point having a mental breakdown and looks like she's going to cry. Darrel shows up and Tells me my crab will be right out and I just ask him to take the other half off the bill and he responds to me to \"not yell at his waitstaff\" which I never did - of course to be lied about by Bre and then to be treated so RUDELY by the person who \"runs this place\" (his words, not mine) set me off. Then his nasty attitude got worse and he decided that he would \"get our check\" and \"there's the door\" to tell us to leave. I have NEVER been treated so POORLY by people who are to SERVE the guests of their establishment. It's HOOTERS, no one expects you to have class, but really you should have some MANNERS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hooters - it is what it is. Food is meh. Service is sub par. Good place to pass the half hour wait for your car to be washed."}
{"text":"Hotel went to shit. The rooms are filthy. The pool use to be chill and now it's lame. They took out the waterfall and jacuzzi's. i probably won't come back here to stay. Would rather pay extra for a better or at least cleaner hotel room."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Hooters restaurant. I heard many things about this franchise over the years and decided to see what the hype was about.   The place was full of gorgeous servers that did not seem too happy to be there. I ordered two pints of beer ( Bud and Rolling Rock) that were flat. The two staff members that served me seemed nice on the surface, but never made eye contact with me or made small talk. It was like they were following protocol. In the end my bill came to about $17.  Hooters tries to recreate what I get at my local pub: a sexy girl who pours me beer while pretending to like me ( a 30+ year old alcoholic with a beer gut). However, I just don't think a corporation can recreate that. You are better off going to an independent bar with a sexy bartender, and there are plenty of those in the GTA. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first hooters experience since I live out of state and it was awful! Our server totally messed everything up we tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but even the manager was rude and didn't want to hear our complaints. The manager gave us 5$ off and an appetizer coupon. The waitress Diane finally gave us an apology at the end of our visit and sadly we were just ready to leave. Never visiting this location again."}
{"text":"These wings are dry at and looking like you gave me someone's left overs! Girl, bye! What a joke! Eff this! Never ordering again!"}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only. But we did have to walk through the hotel and it was a sad looking place. The restaurant was nicely lit. Nice bar. Seating in the front looks busy. Unfortunately the hostess took us all the way to the back where it's dark and ugly. I thought she was walking us to and out the back door. \"No  one puts baby in the corner.\"There were plenty of empty tables in the front and near the bar. We asked to be moved which took a while and annoyed the hostess. In the end we had a nice waitress and enjoyed some beers and wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go on a thurs at noon and the hostess Ariel said it would be ready in 15-20 mins. When i arrived there I had to wait 10 mins because she was too busy hulahooping in the back. When she realized i was there she finally came up to the hostess stand. she never put my order in and was very rude like it was my fault. Never offered an apology. Because of her rudeness I will take my business to BWW or TwinPeaks"}
{"text":"It does me no justice if I ask for a particular item on the nachos and i don't get it. I wanted steak nachos  and what so funny I called up for a pick up and the guy that took my order asked me did I want chicken or steak. I picked up my order, got home No steak no where! If you want get good statistics make sure the order is right or find a new chef."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at a hooters restaurant. Order took 20min and it was wrong! Totally disorganized staff. What a joke! It was like watching a \"Hell's Kitchen\" episode! LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken sandwich in town... Buffalo Chicken Sandwich! My prep choice, 3 mile hot smothered in Ranch Dressing, extra pickle cut in to small pieces and potato salad. Eaten with a knife and fork."}
{"text":"And then he reviewed Hooters...  A friend of mine wanted to watch a basketball game and since we were downtown this was the best place we could think of.  I hadn't been to a hooters in years and I was apprehensive about this trip since I don't eat meat.  They're known for their wings and, something else, not sure what it is.  I'm sure it'll come to me later.  I was happy to see the menu had changed a lot since I had been to a Hooters.  Not only had it changed it actually had food I could eat.    I ordered the fish and chips and I'm very sad to admit it was good.  In fact I had been at a pretty good Irish Pub in north Phoenix the day before for fish and chips and this was actually better...  I'm not sure I'll come back often as it's really not my scene but I was honestly surprised it was as good as it was."}
{"text":"The family and I love coming here! The waitress' are great! We especially love Rachel and Rachel the manager! We drive out of our to go to this one! Food is good and service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Kelli is the absolute best bartender! She's always happy and brings energy whenever she is working."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Wings were great as always.  Waitress was ok.  Menu was misleading so I spoke with the manager.  He decides to reduce my check by $1,00.  Like I would dispute one dollar!  Check came to $27.  Left $40 for the check with him.  Maybe he notices the $13 tip and join reality.  Cause if he thinks discounting a $1 from my bill is enough, he's more dumb than he looks.  No wonder there was only 4 tables during the lunch rush.  Will be sharing my bad experience on FaceBook and all my friends.  No one should have to deal with this guy!"}
{"text":"Went there today for Hooters wings for the first time in years. I ordered half breaded (hot) and half naked (medium). The original were ok, not what I remember, but the naked were something I could buy in a bad pizza place. No flavor. Medium spice, was a joke. Customer service was good, but Hooters has lost its flavor, to me."}
{"text":"The worst Hooters I've been to as far as the food goes.  Hooters are known for their wings, but this place fails miserably at it.  My family ordered the naked wings with original sauce, bbq (smoked?) wings, and the boneless.  All were overcooked and dry, especially the bbq wings, the edges were burnt and the dry rub they put on was too salty.  We got the ranch and blue cheese dressing which were too watered down.  Wings are the easiest meats to cook, especially when they're deep fried.  Just set the damn timer!  It's not rocket science.  Our waitress was...very amateurish:  barely any eye contact, not outgoing, never asked us how everything was, and she brought my daughter another full glass of water and said, \"here's another glass of water incase you want it.\"  Then immediately turned around and left.  Really awkward.  She brought the check the same way too.  Never asked us, \"would like some more water\", or \"can I bring you the bill\", or \"here's the bill when you're ready, no hurry.\"    On a good note, the fried dill pickle chips were excellent!  A must order.  And the host was really nice with a big smile.  She made us feel really good about being there (the beautiful black woman who worked on the eve of 2 Jun 2018)."}
{"text":"Give it up Hooters.  It's obvious you don't care.  I ordered the wings and what I got was chicken bones covered in breading.  There was almost no meat on the wings, the sauce which I like hot, and I tried two different ones and they both tasted exactly the same...like vinegar.  Not hot wings.  I don't even know where you find a supplier that can sell you those wings and call them wings.  They are tiny chicken bones that you sell for over a $1 per wing.  Insulting.  You market yourselves with the iconic Hooters Girls and what a saw was some attractive waitresses dressed in tacky out-dated uniforms walking around with unfriendly/unhappy looks on their faces.  No one was friendly towards me or from what I could tell engaging any other customers in any friendly way.  Sad staff.  I wanted to experience the \"Hooters\" experience and I appreciate a waitress in a sexy outfit.  The truth is that the \"Hooters\" experience does not exist and i couldn't get out of that sad place fast enough.   Your only success is a great location.  I am sure that is the only reason you are surviving.  Why don't you give it up to a restaurant that actually cares and takes pride in their food and service?  Shame on you for selling crap and not caring about it."}
{"text":"Watered down ranch dressing, they barely give you ice in your drink so it's hot, all you get is lettuce in your salad and they also charge you for the watered down ranch. Our server seemed clueless. I will go to another hooters and never to this one again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff ond the food is ok. I had the new daytona wings and they were GREAT!"}
{"text":"Dined there on Dec 5 to celebrate my nephew's birthday.  There were ten of us.  The server was nice but the kitchen was extremely slow and unorganized.  The food came out at different times and was cold!  When I brought this to the attention of the manager, at least I assume she was the manager because she wasn't wearing the Hooter's costume, she was uninterested, unfriendly and never came to the table to check back in. We sat with empty glasses most of the night.  With so many other places to eat in downtown Phoenix, I would never go back and neither would most in my party, except my nephew, who goes there for a whole different reason."}
{"text":"Why does this hooter's get a two star compared to any other hooters? The staff.  Pretentious ladies.  I come here to grab some food and beers sometimes when i want to see the UFC fights.  Unfortunately sitting at the bar even on a slow UFC night I am pretty much invisible.  Service takes forever and sometimes I feel like its  a chore for them to get me a beer.  Hell they drop the beer and turn away before I can utter thank you.  It gets 2 stars for having the fights, beer, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Normally the food at hooters is really good, but today it was not. We started with cheese sticks that are some of the best around. My husband had the sliders and his burgers were overdone and his chicken was not portioned the same. The fries were very dry. I had the parmesan garlic wings and they were really good. The service was really good too. Football wise, they had every game on and we did not have trouble finding the games we were interested in."}
{"text":"We've gone here 3 times now and they keep getting worse.  The last time was take out and when we got home the order was totally wrong."}
{"text":"I like hooters staff and food. Everyone is always friendly but they charge for ranch and blue cheese when you order wings. They also charge $1.99 for carbonated water. This may not seem like a big deal but it's the equivalent to red robin charging for ketchup. I'd really like to see this change hooters it's very sleezy and reflects corporate greed. Other than that it's a nice location. But I think it's time to check out BW's."}
{"text":"Celebrated my Uncle Eagles birthday...food was good and Abigale provided excellent service..."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars on this hooters i would. Food took more than 40minutes. FOR A BURGER! Waitress was annoying and frustating. My lemonade tasted more like water than anything. Fries were the worst thing. Very cold! All that wait for horrible food!!. NO ONE GO HERE! Food is horrible!"}
{"text":"LOVE the wings here, i think next to black dog they are the best in the city.  The grilled chicken sandwich is excellent as well with a side of hot sauce and curley fries.  Only drawback is the price, they are pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.  This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around.   I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow."}
{"text":"Eeek! I used to come here often but it's going downhill and fast!!  It's dirty, even after the \"remodel\"! I checked in late about midnight and the receptionist was just not having it. I was excited to be there and she was yawning and just short with me. I guess I expected more from customer service. She seemed annoyed right when we walked in. That's fine, whatever, not everyone likes where they work. I was gambling for a few hours on slots and the bartender only came by once, even after a 10$ tip for 2 beers!    The worst part - get ready. I go to shower that morning and there is HAIR all over the tub! I was mortified!! The tub was also black ! They don't do a good job of cleaning at all. The counter was also dirty which made me just grossed out by the entire hotel. Not coming back. And no, no one cared when I politely let them know that our room was dirty. The lady said- \"well we cleaned it\". Goodbye Hooters!   Oh! And there was nooo water pressure after I cleaned the shower myself! I had to visit my friends at another hotel because barely any water would flow from the shower head that was dangling off the wall.   Pictures of the bathtub attached!"}
{"text":"The girls here are great, and fun to talk to if you're not creepy or hitting on them!!!  Love the wings, I come with friends every now and then and have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch for 17-year-old it was the only  thing she wanted. because she was a girl they did nothing they were not busy they were slow and blatantly rude didn't even bother saying happy birthday even though we asked they said it was gonna take up to 10 minutes and there was maybe 12 tables all man they got attention though. Sad just sad."}
{"text":"Had boneless wings mild buffalo sauce.  It was good except I could not taste the sauce at all.  The music was to loud for my taste, and with the bare floors it had an echo to it."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. If you wait your turn and speak up about what you want the staff will happily give recommendation along with secrets to what is the best to order. 100% for these gals!!!"}
{"text":"We will not be back to this location!  We love hooters and were very excited when we learned of the opening of this spring valley location.  Went soon after they opened and were very disappointed in everything.  Wrote to corporate, they sent gift cards.  The GM called us and apologized and invited us to come back in. We took him up on his offer and gave them another try.  When we got there we introduced ourselves to the GM and he made sure all was taken care of.  Everything was great!  Went back again another time, did not introduce ourselves and once again bad food and service.   Every fathers day we go to hooters so we went to spring valley again to give them one more shot.  BIG MISTAKE!  They were not busy at all.  No one greeted us.  We picked out a table and sat down.  Waitress came over, very nice, and took our order.  I sent the margarita back, it was horrible, nothing but sweet and sour mix.  Food was not as bad as the previous times but no where near as good as the time the GM took care of us.  As we were waiting for our check and to go boxes we watched our waitress go outside, get in a car, make out with some guy!  Finally another waitress came over and said she would help us.  I saw no manager on the floor during the entire time we were there.  I guess you can only get good food or good service when the GM knows you are coming!"}
{"text":"Went with my fiancé for a early lunch and I asked for Baja shrimp tacos and I got the Baja fish tacos(maybe change the names so there's not confusion) but I still ate them, And my fiancé was drinking bud light and he had 2 bud lights then the third drink he got, he knew he gotten the wrong drink, he said it tasted like Coors. He asked the bartender(Missy) that he didn't taste like bud light. She dumped it and went to the tab and called to us and said \"you see I'm on the bud light tab\" that was so not necessary and she was pouring  for another customer a Coors and called to us again and said \"and now I'm pouring Coors\" super uncalled for and so unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.   This spot would be great for football games and sitting outside, but it's poorly run.  It was 80 degrees on NFL Sunday and the outdoor patio was not open.  We sat originally in the dining area, but after 10 minutes of waiting for a server we moved to the bar.  Where we noticed why we weren't being served, the whole dining area only had one server.  Which is ridiculous because the restaurant is split in 2, so theres no way to see customers on the other side.   At the bar there were 2 women bartenders and a gentlemen bartender.  The girl bartenders were constantly calling over a male at the bar to go do shots with them.  One of them was messy, you could tell she'd had a few already.  The gentlemen bartender was serving everyone, the women were just hanging out really. We ordered appetizers, but they weren't treated that way, all the food came out at one time.  The food was fine, I mean already made fried food, can't be too hard."}
{"text":"Wow! Don't know where to start so many bad things say,and so little time.Let us keep it simple. Food really, really bad. Price oh my God them must be gold plated chickens,maybe thats why they taste so bad. The service was ok not good just ok, and my wife and I where the only customers at the time. Save your money fire up the grill make your own, I guarantee they will be better then what you would have spent way to much for at Hooters. I rated the noise level as quiet because my wife and I didn't make much noise. I gave it 4 [ $]  just because it so overpriced."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar by beautiful ladies that actually hold a conversation with you for a little while. Fantastic wings after I asked for them well done and with extra sauce. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Who comes for the service? Hooters. Global, Casinos, Wings, Tit$, sports, and beer. Good food and atmosphere. Never come here for the service because it does happen!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Hooters.  Not sure what is up with this location.  There was a table next to us with 4 guys who thought they were at a sports bar and were loud and obnoxious.  The waitress was inattentive and did not see here from the time we ordered to the time we requested the check.  And to top it off...the wings were mediocre at best....I asked for the breaded wings....but there was so much breading on them they were not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Even though we were upgraded to a suite we are still dissatisfied with our stay... bad customer service..............."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch,  the place was real clean and neat.  Staff was friendly and always checked up to make sure everything was ok,  or if we needed anything.  Food was delicious,  we started off with some fried pickles and they were excellent not thin and greasy like other places.   Wings hit the spot, I got an order of 10 bbq and my wife got an order of 10 hot.  We also got an order of curly fries that were amazing.   I recommend you try this place,  you will love it."}
{"text":"Had a grilled chicken salad. Chicken was over cooked and very dry. I asked for honey mustard and got ranch. The girls seemed to be rushed with little time for good service.  Not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"STAFF STAFF STAFF... and owners.... ;)   Are amazing!  Super friendly, amazing wings, Ice cold beer (that I can not drink and envy as I stare at my friends) and great environment and crowd.  Not sure how they stay open half the time, as much as I hear and see them pay out on their slots, but hey... better for the customers!"}
{"text":"I went there a while back with my family (don't ask me why they thought this would be the type of joint to go to for a family gathering) and I would say we had a little bit of under average service while we were there. First off, our waitress came to start taking our order after getting our drinks and managed to ask for our order maybe five times before actually writing it down. If you don't think you're going to remember it the first three times, maybe you should write it down. She didn't seem to know the menu that much and even if she was new she didn't care to know it when we had questions about certain meals. Her response to a question we asked about what kind of spices were in the garlic salt wings was, \"well..... It's spicy........ And it's garlic?\" I guess one of the plus sides was the food."}
{"text":"I really want to come back to try more of their menu. Sampled some wings (smoked/Daytona) and their big fat fries. I preferred the taste of the Daytona wings better, but definitely appreciated the charred crispness of the smoked wings. The fried were too heavily salted so next time I would request that they hold the salt. The cheese that they offer for an additional .99 cents, I thought it was going to be more of a regular cheddar cheese sauce but it's actually nacho cheese sauce. Sweet tea was good, the staff was friendly, my server Kayla was very attentive."}
{"text":"The wings tasted like fried chicken, no seasoning. Food was slow to arrive and I must add they were not busy.  We were told several times that our order was on its way out only to find that was not the case. Refills were also slow to arrive. Unfortunately, I do not see a return visit in the future."}
{"text":"Came into Hooters for lunch because we were craving wings and it was close by. Our food took a really long time to come out and we only ordered 20 wings and a salad. Our server, Ivory, might have been new but had little to no knowledge of the menu. My salad came out wrong TWICE and it was still on the check. A manager never came by and the server just stared at me when I told her my salad was wrong to the point I asked if she was going to fix it. It wasn't a good experience at all. Only plus was the General Taos wing flavor!"}
{"text":"They're 2.5 stars for a reason. Called to place To go order and placed on hold for 5 minutes. Hung up and called back and was told they just stopped taking orders even though they're still open for another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant regularly.  The food is always great and the staff is friendly and attentive. The manager, Kim, runs a great shop and is always around to check on customers.  Lots of specials and events.  I recommend the Samurai Wings.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well they no longer have the Chicken Strip Cheese sandwich and what they replaced it with pretty much sucks. Other than that its like a normal hooters with some new wing flavors and steak fries."}
{"text":"First Hooters where the food was just sooo bad and the whole vibe in this casino is just old and run down. Maybe rip out the carpets and make it all wooden floors to awaken the place up. Long wait They dont wear the traditional uniform here either. Just overall disappointed and wouldn't return nor recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was fresh and tasty. Not high end but better than most.  Our server, Breeana is a doll. Very pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location- my husband and i were able to be seated right away on a Friday night (granted it was 8pm) but I hate waiting! I thought the fried pickles were pretty tiny and wish that they were a little bit thicker (so it didn't just taste like breading). Chicken was typical Hooters chicken -nothing special for the price. The one thing that I will say was great is that they do have every NHL playoff game there."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, the beer selection is weak and the beer prices are insane. $6 for a 25 oz. or $15 bucks for a pitcher of Michelob ultra. I also suspect the pitchers are slightly smaller than the typical 64 oz because we didn't even get 4 full glasses out of one. The wings were decent but not particularly noteworthy  and they were very expensive @ 23 bucks for 20 wings. Note to self, stop coming here, there are better options. Two Stars...not a good value."}
{"text":"In town for a week and decided on a late dinner here. It was AYCE wings night so it was pretty busy. We only had a short wait to be seated and our server Jayd was very prompt in her service even though she was clearly swamped. Super sweet girl and she did her best to give good service. Food took a while to come out but was good, beer was cold...we were happy. My only complaint is the ladies room was messy, and some of the other girls working had attitudes."}
{"text":"Can i give a no stars??? This place is horrible I went last Saturday with my family sat on the patio for 26 minutes with no one asking for drinks. We finally told a manger where are server replied and said \"no one wants to take the table they are fighting for who takes it\" seriously? I then told the manager \"I will be writing a bad review on Yelp\" she replied \"I know huh\" worst worst worst service ever..  ****update**** Contact the manager Brian told him about my situation and and compliant very respectful and understanding was advised some of the hooter girls were new so I understand I'll be back to that hooters Thanks Brian!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss with service and food. Today the food was great and service was good. I don't get the negative reviews your hear for the wings with a good looking waitress otherwise you would be at hooters. There was no wait time in line and the kitchen was fast today.  Still the best hooters out of the three in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Bad service. Food could be better. We got it somewhat cold. Our cups would sit empty for long periods of time until we say we want a refill.  She couldn't get the channel correct after so many customers tried to help her: OH and the waitresses???SNOBS. I was even scared to stop them and ask for something else lol. Was my first time here. & I wouldn't come back. I'll stick to BWW and home. Ugh."}
{"text":"Megan took care of us today and as soon she left out table, my roommate and I looked at each other and said \"She is so good and so nice.\" She was genuine and attentive. It turns out it was her first day by herself on the floor. Yes she made a couple of errors that affected our order, BUT!...she graciously handled it and the manager, Brian, made everything right. I was so concerned that Megan's mistake would be frowned upon (because we LOVED her) but Brian assured us that she was a respected employee.   Bottom line: Brian (manager) and Megan (waitress) took care of us the way all patrons should be taken care of. I want to thank them for making good decisions when approached with concerns. :) Very professional and courteous. :)"}
{"text":"There is only 3-4 customers and not a bartender in sight at the non gambling side. Waitress said she's playing host too. Waited 20 minutes for a drink and my food took 34 minutes and fries were cold. Ordered a TEXAS melt and she didn't tell me it was regular TEXAS toast. Expected me to read it at the end. Worst experience ever at a hooters. Last time I come here"}
{"text":"Honestly, the only reason I gave 1 star was because the hostess smiled when we stood at her stand. Place wasn't busy at all, we had just came in for some quick food because we just came off our flight. I'd say there were about 10 other groups of people. Our server only had one other table if that.   First off, service was horrible. The only decent thing our server did was come to the table with water at the greet, but not everyone likes lemons floating in their water. I ordered the regular hooter style wings in Daytona sauce... instead I received the Daytona styled wings and ordered the margarita which was horrible.. the other people in my party also both revived the wrong food (boneless instead of traditional, etc.)   Once the girl dropped our food off, we never saw her again until literally when everyone was done. Like what? You're at least supposed to make sure everything is good mid way, not at the end. I usually don't leave crappy tips, or at least try not too but she sucked."}
{"text":"Way great service yesterday . We the best waitress, Shannon was so on top of things drinks were always full she was super friendly and always coming around to see if everything was good. We have had hit and miss service in the past at this Hooters. The food was perfect plenty of sauce on the boneless wings. I love this hooters compared to other locations in Las Vegas because they will make your boneless wings \"Naked\" (get your mind out of the gutter it means without breading).  I hope this is a good sign that's this pace will be more consistent."}
{"text":"Service was not as bad as I expected. The waitress was always good about keeping my glass full but the kitchen service was slow. it took forever to get our food. I had wings and it was good as any other hooters I've been to. If you have the time to sit and wait for your food this place is good."}
{"text":"I was in Hooters today with some coworkers for a quick lunch. I had never been to a hooters before but it pretty much was what I expected.  When i phoned to make reservations I was asked if it was a special occasion. I told them that one of our coworkers was having a birthday. The manager said  \"ill get the girls to put up some balloons\".  Anyhow, we arrived and were seated at our balloon table, we had a few extra people and they kindly added an extra table.. Our waitress was pleasant, and she was great, sweet, friendly and without question, beautiful. The menu screams Mancave buffet...all things greasy, fatty and decadent. There is a time and place for this kind of food, and the time is now, the place is Hooters.  I got a Caesar salad minus the chicken and it was tasty but highly forgettable. My coworkers got wings, burgers , chicken burgers etc, and all commented on how tasty the food was, a guilty pleasure.  We arrived at 1130 and we didnt have food on our table till 1230. Granted, there were 12 of us, but there were people who arrived long after us who were eating long before us.  When it came time to settle my bill, the bill was $14.15, I gave her a 20 and asked for change. The change I got back was a five dollar bill and 85 cents...without any smaller bills I had to give her a fiver...I didnt really mind as the waitress was nice, but the wait for food was not good, and it kind of ticked me that I had no choice but to tip generously or not at all.   I would likely go here again, when I want some greasy good food.... I will say that the general tone of this place lent itself well to some raunchy uninhibited conversation which ran the gauntlet from fetishes to stories of ex bf's and gf's.  All in all, the experience was fun, the wait for food too long, but I would give them another shot in fhe future. One last thing, I asked our waitress if men ever treated  the girls here badly and she said \"sometimes yah\". The feeling I got was that the girls who work there are fully aware that to some degree their looks are exploited, but also smart enough to use them to thier advantage while they can. To that I say, good for them.  This kind of hiring exists everywhere whether its a good looking male waiter or an attractive woman, hooters just doesn't hide, nor make apologies for  it."}
{"text":"I had the 10 piece boneless which was cold and not very good. I took over an hour to get our food and place was almost empty. Hopefully it was just a bad day. Will give them another shot next week. Hopefully I can give them more stars next time."}
{"text":"Nov. 3, 2017. Bought the $27 Groupon for $40 worth of food and drinks at the Hooters located at 7155 S Rainbow Blvd., Las Vegas, NV.  11:00PM - Items ordered: 2.99 - Iced  tea 2.99 - Pepsi 8.49 - Grilled Chicken sandwich 10.99 - Mix & Match Sliders 13.79 - 10 pc. Original Wings  39.25 Total  Great food. Nothing owed and tipped.  Our server, Grace (who works the graveyard shift) was awesome in taking care of us!  Friendly, courteous and professional."}
{"text":"Here is what i love about Hooter's on Mill Ave!  First, if the weather permits sit on the balcony. My wife and i love it and that is why we returned on many occasions. Sort of  our spot on Mill i guess?   Next, Free Wi-Fi...i very much like that. I know i am on my phone and not paying attention. Nope, we what You Tube and check our Facebook and Twitter. So we have fun.  Lastly, the beer! We always get a tall draft of Dos Equis!!! Love it.   Food is not my thing there. Not much a fan so its pretty much a liquid diet when we go. But we do like the deep fried pickles.   So 4 stars for atmosphere and location from me."}
{"text":"Smoked naked wings... not good! But my children ordered the buffalo chicken quesadilla and cheese quesadilla and oh so yummy..why go to a wing place for quesadillas... hmmm"}
{"text":"Ask for Alhena.  She is an experienced Hostess for Hooters and is a great representation of the chain. Bill the manager was making sure every customer was happy.  Service.   5 Food quality.   5 manager.   5"}
{"text":"Can I give 0 stars? Really... you advertise 15 flavors available for wings... and when my party order's 50 wings, you say we can only choose 2 flavors! What the hell? I can go down the street and order any number of wings at Native New Yorker and get them in ANY configuration. And right next store there is a Buffalo Wild Wings with a more liberal flavor policy as well.  That is exactly what I did. Walked next door to BWW and got 50 wings, for less money and got to choose 5 flavors! If you want to survive with all of your nearby competition, you are going to have to step up your game!"}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to the hooter brand. The service is unbelievably slow, and the boobs are smaller than they should be. I asked for all drummies, did not get app drummies. At one point the waitress didn't check in on us for 30 minutes - and let me tell you, I was NOT ALRIGHT. I also have a sneaking suspicion that there aren't actually any owls here."}
{"text":"WOW was that horrible service. Ordered 50 wings & they brought out all drumsticks. Waitress asked if we wanted to \"send some back to swap them\"? I actually had to count some out in a plate for her to take back to the kitchen. A few minutes later, she brought those back & said she didn't need them after all. Everyone in our group had to ask for every drink refill. She didn't get the drink order right, fries were not fresh, wings, I mean drumsticks were rather dry. When we got the bill, she charged an up charge for the drumsticks. Wth? We didn't want all drumsticks. I had to ask another waitress to fix the check as ours was nowhere to be seen. The only time the waitress came quickly to the table was to pick up our money. Never saw a manager. No wonder the restaurant is slow on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This is Hooters.  You know what to expect.  I did have the fried pickles, which were surprisingly good, but oh so unhealthy.  We had quite a few people in our group and the servers handled us very well."}
{"text":"This place just opened so I'll give it some slack. Went on a Thursday night and we were seated right away, the hostess was nice but she wouldn't let us sit at a table for 4 because we were only 2 people even though there were 2 other couples who were seated at those tables (they were better). She didn't really give a reason, just shrugged and told us we couldn't change. I was pretty annoyed by that because why couldn't we get a better table if other couples did? Anyways, we took our seats and started to settle down when we noticed the table was FILTHY. Just really wet, sticky, and covered in pepper?? I flagged down a waitress and asked if we could change tables because the one we were given was filthy and she said it was ok!  So we did end up getting a better table!  Our waitress was named Kelsey and she was really nice! We ordered some wings and a burger. It did take a long time but Kelsey made sure to check in with us to let us know our order was still on its way. When we finally got the food it was ok. Good wings but pricey for the quality. Burger was bland and so were the fries. Maybe their food game will be better once they're more settled in but for now they need a lot of work.  As we were paying for the meal I asked if all the floors were open. It's 6 floors high but only 3 of them are for eating.  1st to 3rd floor = restaurant 4th floor = storage 5th floor = offices  6th floor = staff room  Kelsey told us that next time we come, we can ask what floor we want. So will definitely ask for the third floor!  I'd recommend to wait before visiting as they really aren't at their best. But once they are it will be very fun to go.  If you do decide to go anyway, ask for the third floor! There is a pool table!!"}
{"text":"Ya ummmmm no I don't care how cute they women are they have nooo personality  at all and the food sucks ass. Not ever going back food cold women that work here rude.."}
{"text":"Service is really, really bad!!! I do not recommend it. The place is dirty, table was sticky, the roof was leaking! Awful!"}
{"text":"Wings are nasty. The curly fries don't taste like anything other than the sauce you use to dip them in. I've been here many times just because different friends invite me there. I been there a good 8 times, had different foods every time and I don't think I've ever had anything good. Except the beer, it's good, very cold, but way too overpriced. Honestly, service isn't that bad. But it's not gonna help the one star I'm giving this place."}
{"text":"Our dinning experience at Hooters today was amazing. The food was exquisite and delicious. We had the wonderful opportunity to meet the manager  Chris Lugo and he made the night incredible. Very accommodating and made service was remarkable. Thanks Chris we will be back just because of you."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 40 Seniors from MeetUp yesterday. We had a Halloween Party complete with decorations, costumes, games and trivia.  The staff was very accommodating. Meals were served efficiently around our activities.  Food was excellent!  We couldn't be more pleased."}
{"text":"I went to wing Wednesday which is all-you-can-eat wings for $12.99and even though they raise the prices it's still really great deal. You can eat as many wings you want to get all the different flavors and have a good time enjoying the atmosphere. The girls are smoking hot! All the types of sauces are awesome! And I had at least 25 wings in one sitting. I would definitely go again just not every Wednesday maybe once a month."}
{"text":"Showed up here this weekend with friends and had a great time.  The staff was very attentive, entertaining and of course beautiful.  The food is consistently good and the beer is consistently cold.  I plan on coming back here to watch UFC 200.  Hope I get in because this place can get packed on certain nights.  I live in the west valley, but this is definitely my go to place for UFC fights.  The manager even checked up on us twice.  How cool is that!!  Hey Hooters staff, see you guys on July 9th.  Save me two seats!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Hanging out before the Color Fun Run! Aliyah our server is super great :). Very helpful with ordering the right flavor and snacks"}
{"text":"This place is a restaurant right??? THEN FIX THE DARN FOOD! The food is mediocre at best. Wings are 3\" of breading around 1 millimeter of meat. Hamburgers were all greasy and lopsided on the bun and gave us terrible upset stomachs.  As for service...sure it's nice to look at 21 year old waitresses in skimpy clothing. BUT... the waitress decided to take our order and not write anything down just did it by memory. So of course when our order came it was completely wrong. Then she gave us an attitude problem. After food was delivered she disappeared until we were ready to leave.  Sorry, I won't eat here again. We spent over $100 for food that was no better than what you would get off the McDs dollar menu."}
{"text":"Typical Hooters what can you say..wings can be greasy if its busy because they turn them out fast..wait staff seems to turn over on a regular basis lately..great sports bar is what to expect here"}
{"text":"As promised, bigger and better! This place is huge, waitstaff very friendly, food awesome as always!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Hooters since they first arrived in Las Vegas in the early 90s (late 80s?).  When they opened up this location near my house I couldn't be happier.  First the food. The food is typical hooters.  Really good, but there are places out there slightly better. But combine location, plus cost, plus atmosphere and you really can't do better. I like the wings, naked, all drums, grilled Daytona style with spicy garlic sauce. Also the burgers are really good . I sometimes even get the crab legs or the fried pickles. My only real complaint is the lack of ROASTED OYSTERS.  That's right, when Hooters first opened they had roasted oysters. They came in a large bucket, covered with a hot towel and they gave you an oyster shucker to open them. Hooters management said it was because of the oil spill that happened years ago in the south why they no longer had them.  I really hope they bring them back someday.  As for the staff, management is great.  There are a group of 3 familiar guys that run the place. They are always friendly and helpful.  They'll change the channels for you and even give you the wi-fi password.  As for the waitresses, I'd say 90% of them are at a Hooters level of customer service. When they acknowledge you as \"their table\" you are usually greeted somewhat cheerfully and they are for the most part friendly.  Some fo them even go into their pro acting job and ask you about your day or what you do, etc. We know it's a service industry and that's part of the act, but it is a nice touch. I would say about 5% of the girls go above and beyond. They remember you from the last time you came and they even come and say hi to you even if you are \"not their table\".  It's nice to be acknowledged as a regular.  Sadly most of the time it's by the male management, but like I said, a couple girls remember and say hi regardless.  Sadly the remaining 5% of the girls are horrible. There are only one (maybe two) that I fear getting when I walk in.  I hate that feeling \"well now I got to run the gauntlet today for lunch cuz this girl sucks\". I'm not the type of person to complain about service, especially if I'm a regular. instead I suffer silently.  The girl in question is so bad. She rushes you though the ordering process. She never writes anything down. As you can see from above, I have a complex order, so it's always a gamble if I'll get it right. God forbid it's wrong, I have to decide if it's worth flagging her down, telling she is wrong and getting a new order.  The saying \"a bad apple ruins the bucnh\" is true.  That one ore two employees prevented me from giving a 5 star review.  I hope in the future these employees move on.  I hate playing the gambler when I come in to my local Hooters, \"will I get a good waitress?\" Maybe management can have more customer service training more often.  I've also wrote a review about a Japanese Hooters, explaining how they had the best costumer service I've ever seen.  Maybe the Hooters here can fly a few of those Japanese Hooters girls in and have them train the locals? Japanese girls are HIGH ENERGY, some of the waitresses here would benefit from a little energy boost.  Anyhow, this is a great Hooters, good food, pretty girls, great atmosphere. I'm a fan.  TIP: this place is ridiculous on big sporting event nights, especially UFC fights. I usually go only at lunch time, but I've made the mistake going on a UFC night.  I'm not a UFC fan so I had no clue what was going on.  So if going at night, you might want a backup plan if you drive by and see the parking lot overflowing and people pouring out of the building."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate lower but had the worst experience here at this location last Saturday. We came in after the baseball game at 4pm ordered right away, the waitress was attentive in welcoming us and getting our order. After that it all went downhill very quick, an hour wait still no food we ask what's the issue and they say should be coming out soon. We wait another 30 min and part of the food comes out cold, still where missing 4 people including my kids food, the waitress comes over informed us that they lost our ticket which is why it took so long for our order to come out. We request to speak to the manager and inform him the food is cold and on top of that it's not complete. We finally got the rest of our order and thankfully my kids food was warm but our friends nachos where a joke zero cheese and meet. After 2 hours we again talk to the manager tell him this was unacceptable he did apologize and say he would take some of the items off our bill which I was thankful for, however he leaves with our tickets doesn't come back. We get the server to see what's going on since we just want to get out at that point, she brings us the check only to find since we split it the discount was gone, again get the manager involved and says I'll fix it now at 2.5 hours here we get our ticket to pay. What an extremely poor managed place, the manager apologized said he messed up on 4 other orders as well which I don't care I just wanted to get out and leave. The funny thing is he got into an argument with a customer who wanted to watch a show on the tv and told him there's a dennys down the road super rude of that comment. I would recommend not going here especially when there are other chains across the street with much better service and food."}
{"text":"We chose Hooters instead of Buffalo Wild Wings because we were with a friend who is from Ireland and had never been to a Hooters. It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive, when we were seated, there was less than 10 parties in the whole restaurant. We asked the server to send the manager over and he blamed the slowness on the kitchen getting slammed because there was an event nearby, but we had arrived before \"the kitchen was slammed\". He said he would look at our checks and get back to us, he never returned to our table. Our server came back and asked if everything had been taken care of and we said the manager never came back, she finally was able to get our checks. The manager did give us a discount off of our check, but I was overall disappointed in the whole experience and felt bad for our visiting friend who's first impression of Hooters was terrible."}
{"text":"The food is unusually good here. I went reminesant of times when I was here more frequently in my earlier years and didn't expect the food to be close to as good as what it was. They've updated their menus and the girls aren't in such skimpy clothes any more. The service was slow. Our server should have checked on more often as we had to get the attention of others to help us with utensils. My crab legs came out cold but was taken back and heated up. Food is good but service can be improved."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 5 stars is because the bartender Tyler Jewett (whom also did not boast about being the GM)  has outstanding customer service.  The waitresses ignored us. We waited for 30mins after being seated.  Mind you, I just got off a 12hr shifts and I was starving! My husband went to the bar to ask if we could please order food.  He immediately took the initiative to take our orders and serve us drinks.  The entire time we were there he tended to the folks at the bar and then left the bar to take care of us even if he could've asked a waitress to tend to us.  He made us a priority which in my eyes is phenomenal. As busy as he was at the bar he made sure we were happy and satisfied. We will be coming again soon to see Tyler and experience his awesome service again. I work for a high end dealership and I know an exceptional customer service experience when I see it. Thank you again for the awesome service.  You turned around a not so great experience into building new regular customers.  Cheers."}
{"text":"This is a Hooters...like any other Hooters I've seen...although I've only dined at one other, so I can't be completely certain. Still, it is what it is: chicken wings and (supposedly) titillating (great word, eh?) outfits on the servers. Nevertheless, here's a few random notes (good and bad) about this place:      + On Wednesdays, it is ALL YOU CAN EAT chicken wings for $9.99! Whaaaat? Yuuup! My most recent discovery. I finally have a reason to come to Hooters of my own volition.    - During Happy Hour you can get discounted glasses of ice with a little bit of well drinks in them.    + Happy Hour also boasts discounts on domestic beers (I think only $3 or something).    - However, Shock Top must be brewed in an \"un-domestic\" section of one the 12 United States Anheuser-Busch breweries because it is not considered domestic, and thus not discounted.    + There are plenty of TVs about, so not an entirely bad place to watch a game...if that game happens to be on a Wednesday.  Overall, this place is not bad. And, as I inferred above, I'll probably be back on a random Wednesday evening, causing gasps of horror from all unfortunate onlookers that are witnessing my gratuitous (over-)indulging in massive amounts of chicken wings."}
{"text":"Hooters is the bombbbbb (idk if people still say that)!! But I come to Vegas pretty often, usually around once every month or so and it is a must to visit Hooters solely for the $1 blackjack. It is an electronic dealer and they're all rigged however I can sit there for hours with her. The table is double sided with a $1 and $2 side. You can also bet 3 separate side bets which increases your chances of winning so it's very easy to come up a few hundred bucks. It's extremely addicting but awesome because it's just $1. NOW for the restaurant..that's another story. The restaurant sucks and the girls that work there provide extremely slow service and look like they hate their jobs."}
{"text":"The Philly cheesesteak and burger we had for lunch were very good. The service was great, waitress was very attentive. There was only one negative while we were there. There was a university of Illinois football game on. One of the waitress (not our, thank goodness) seemed to get very agitated if she found out anyone was rooting for the other team. She actually came up to our table, gave us a dirty look, and told us she has friends on the team. You can root for whatever team you want, but you probably shouldn't try to pick fights with customers when you work for tips!"}
{"text":"I was a victim of racism and a who their location in Phoenix Arizona. (10223 N Metro Pkwy W, Phoenix, AZ 85201) I am a black woman and I went to Hooters to have a girls night out with me you're my friend, after eating and taking my shot the manager came out and accuse me of stealing a shot glass. I was so shocked and annoyed. Just the fact that the manager is going to come out and asked if I stole a shot glass actually made me cry. I asked the manager why would I steal a shot glass ask him do you want to see in my purse I hope in my purse and showed the manager. Inside of my purse dentally be gone to state a lot of racial comments. So I stated that why are you asking me if I steal a shot glass is it because I am a black person then he started cursing and honestly I am so mad I feel so offended I will never go back. Honestly I would love to get but my $40 that I spend there no lie."}
{"text":"First time going to this location. Took over an hour to get appetizers. Service was terrible. An hour and 5 minutes for wings and oysters is ridiculous. Plates were dirty, silverware had dried food on it still. Wrote the corporate office and didn't get a response. Great customer service.. Not."}
{"text":"Great place to go after a long day of work. It was also my first time coming to a hooters. I ordered the onion ring tower, and buffalo chicken dip to start. As for wings i got traditional habanero bbq. Those are really good if you want something sweet with a spicy kick. So the food was great, but the service could of been better. Our waitress was too busy, and didn't check back on us often. She didn't even realize our wings were brought to us already. Also upon paying we couldn't find her so we had to wait a good 10 minutes. But overall food was good. I do see myself coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Great food. Some of the best food that I ever had at a hooters. Wait staff was terrible.  Waitress disappeared on us.  When she did come to our table she was very rude.  Wings did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was not up to par with what we have had in the past. Got there only about 3 other tables had peeps and still took 15-20 minutes to get food. Had better bugers in the past is why the 3stars"}
{"text":"I see lots of bad reviews on this location and now I wonder when I'll have a bad experience there. I usually dine here once a week for a late lunch for happy hour after I wake up starving from working the night shift and before my pedicure excursion. Prompt greeting is not their priority and some of the server girls can be a bit dizzy. What that means is that sometimes you have to ask for things to be brought to you. They are friendly though and stop by the table frequently to see if you need something and I have no problem telling them what and if I do. It's a casual environment, I just woke up, I'm in my sweats and don't need 5 Star treatment or food yet, you get my drift... Mozarella sticks; very good! Boneless wings with Daytona Beach sauce; very good! Onion rings; very good!  Their iced teas; not so good, I wanna bet they're made from a powder, not freshly brewed. House margarita; awful! Weak and watered down. Just stick with local draft beer, soda and basic wings. Nice outdoor patio area with water misters where I can smoke, I'm happy! Sure beats a drive thru!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through DoorDash and this location screwed up my entire order. We ordered \"original wings\" mild. That means breaded and tossed in sauce. They came naked and with very little sauce. The sliders I ordered for my son off the kids menu was requested plain, just meat and bread. They came with cheese and the appetizer sliders were requested with bacon and you guessed it, no bacon.   For a meal that cost over $60 it should have been correct. Who's checking orders at Hooters? I assume no one."}
{"text":"Long wait until our food arrived, cold fries, overly salty lemon peppers wings and what appeared to be a small BBQ boneless wing was actually a burnt piece of grease covered in BBQ sauce (gross)! Never received a bill with the full breakdown, just a total amount of what we owe. I was excited to come here and after this disappointing trip, probably won't be back. Waste of money for sure."}
{"text":"This place has gone so down hill since Eddie. We have been coming here for the last 3 years with groups of people that range from 7 to 15.  It's always been a great atmosphere with lots of pretty girls.   Now it's the worst.  Our waitress looks beat the hell up. On top she screwed the order up.  I ordered 60 wings naked all drums they came needed and mixed.  It 15 minutes to get a plate to eat off of.  I asked for fries didn't get them.  Ordered ranch didn't get them.  The bathroom looked and smelled like a high school locker room.   We will take our business elsewhere.  It just sucked."}
{"text":"Wow what difference. Used to be a loyal of the Hooters hotel resturant. Well this location is beyond superior than the hotel. The food is amazing cheaper and portions are a lot bigger. The waitresses are great always friendly warm and welcoming. They always have a smile and fast service. I will be returning only to this location from now on. Way to win my business Hooters!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to watch UFC events. They don't have a cover charge when most places do. Food is average, not great. But the sweet waitresses make up for that."}
{"text":"Service awful, I think waitress came by once all meal. Food was cold. My wife actually watched our order sit in the window for 5 min before she picked it up. Very few tables with customers and awful service. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to watch a UFC fight, and swung in here. Completely packed, but the hostess worked hard to make two spaces for me and my wife at the bar, and was over the top eager to get us seats. Very attentive bartenders.   The food was good, but the shrimp were small. Awesome wings. Will come back on fight night."}
{"text":"We will not be back. We waited in the lobby to be seated for 5 minutes, when the girl finally came to seat us, she had a major attitude. I asked for a manager, the manager came out she used the excuse \" we are short staffed\" that is not my fault or concern. Take better care of your customers."}
{"text":"Discovered this little Hooters in SW near Rainbow and Warm Springs. We come every so often to drink a Blue Moon beer and eat some wings at the bar (more fun). Our favorite are the Daytona Beach flavor, sweet and little kick of spicyness, some shrimp, curly fries, sliders, fried pickles... their Ranch is to die for including the blue cheese dressing. They prepare them on site. I had to ask how they prepare it so one of the manager gave me the details of his preparation! that was cool :-) When you come really late, they sometimes play 80s music (LOVE it), still games for the guys. Staff is friendly.  Cool to have you guys near by!"}
{"text":"Went there about 2-3 weeks ago Sunday morning for the football game. The host was not very nice and when my boyfriend asked her to repeat what she had said she said \"nothing\" which till this day we don't know what she said! Anyways we got our food and drinks nothing fancy the wings are overrated there, they really are not tasty at all. So at half time we decided to leave and we were splitting the bill between 3 people I told her exactly what amount should be charged to each card and she came back with our receipts we signed and left. So a couple of days after I look at my online statement and saw that they charged me $30.00 when my bill was only $15.00! (I tipped her like $2) I immediately called them and transferred to a manager by the name of jesse he was very short and not concerned with what had happened he just said to give him the last 4 of my card and my number and to call back the next day. I was really busy so I called back a couple of days later and spoke to another manager by the name of Enrique he was a little nicer and told me he would make some calls and call me back later which he NEVER did!! It has been over 2 weeks now and they have not gave me my money back! Seriously what can you expect from a place like this but still they shouldn't be stealing people's money. Will definitely NEVER come back her especially my family that would come frequently to watch the football games. Loosing a client for $15.00!   UPDATE! 10/7/15 Called them again since I never got a call back! Spoke to Jesse AGAIN gave him all my info and explained the situation again. He looked at the receipts that day and said that I had tipped $15 that's why they charged me $30!!! Wtf!! I let him know I did not do that like why would I tip my full amount her service was not good at all and even if she was I would never tip the full amount of my bill! He said he would wait until his GM would come in and SEE if they could reimburse me my money! I am just in disbelief this \"waitress\" changed what I had on the receipt. She was skinny, not too short with blonde hair and that day had red lipstick. I know most of the girls look like that but I will find out her name and make sure she faces consequences for what she did! Waiting on jesses call to see if they are going to reimburse me."}
{"text":"It's Hooters, gets 3 stars just for that. Wings are always good, service is good. Only complaint would be the wait time on the food."}
{"text":"AmberLynn is amazing here! She was fast, reliable, and so sweet. Great customer service. I would recommend this new Hooters location at the palms to anyone who loves a nice pool view and some delicious drinks and food Thank you again AmberLynn for such great service. We will be back ;)"}
{"text":"This is the only Hooters I know that has Hogaarden on tap. When they serves it, it comes out ice cold with ice crystals. Great beer and good bar food."}
{"text":"Always a good atmosphere to watch games here. The food is always exceptional. Always have a good time with friends or family when we come here. The staff is always friendly.  The only suggestion I have is to improve the video quality of some of there equipment. Not HD on some of the TVs.  Other than that. They are doing a good job at this location. Shame that the mall is closing and the present location is not optimal."}
{"text":"How the once mighty and perky have now fallen and sagged. Hooter's always seems so kick ass in the movies, yet both times I went, I was highly disappointed.  The food, service, tables, and overall atmosphere are just bland.  The beer selection limited, the wooden chairs are uncomfortable.  There are 50 better places a short walk away.  In any case, it is required to visit Hooters once every 5 years for the novelty."}
{"text":"Update... contacted Hooters Corporate. A MONTH later, still no response. I guess they really DONT CARE about their customers. No Hooters location will ever get my, my family's, my friend's, a random stranger on the street's, or any other business that I can prevent them from having. No customer should ever be treated the way manager juan, treated us.    All bad... Attended a car show at this Hooters location. It started to rain, so my group retreated inside to get a bite to eat. We had a group of 10, and seated reasonably quick. Our server was friendly enough, her failure to check in with us for over 20 minutes combined with the fact that we waited nearly 90 minutes for our food made for a start to a truly awful customer service experience. At the point where our drinks were empty for nearly 20 minutes, one of our party asked for a manager and complained about the situation. The manager, Juan, only made things worse. He had the kitchen expedite our food, which was a bad idea. 2 of my friends chicken, was still pink and raw. My fries were still cold and uncooked in the middle. On top of that, only half our table got our food. The other half waited an additional 10 minutes. Their food also came out rushed and raw. So this is where things go from bad to worse. We asked for Juan again. When we were explaining that our food was raw, he basically called us liars, even though we picked apart the food to show him! When I tried to talk to him about my plate, he dismissed me and walked away. He then resumed arguing with another member of my party. My friend kept an even and appropriate tone, but Juan threatened to have him removed! At this point I re-approached Juan, because I couldn't listen to this anymore. As I walked up, he told me I need to go sit down! I told him no, and at this point he is no longer going to dismiss me. I explained our complaints, but he brushed it off as \"impossible.\"  Juan was clearly agitated, and started posturing as if he was going to fight me. I never even raised my voice, as I'm in customer service, and know it doesn't accomplish anything. I simply wanted a properly cooked meal for me and my friends. I asked for Juan's boss's information, but all he would give me is his locations email address, and I believe it was written nearly illegible on purpose.   I hope Hooters upper management actually reads this. Juan is grossly under qualified to be a manager in this location. I would consider this a coaching and development moment, but I doubt it would be effective."}
{"text":"I had a girls night with some friends, and the service was amazing. Our waitress was Danni she recommended the smothered chicken sandwich, which was amazing, and she sat down with our table and we had a great time. She was very helpful with the menu and drinks. It was our first time going here so we had no idea what to order. She made our experience amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped in while in AZ on a business trip; was craving their chicken strips.  Upon entering, I waited for a solid 3 minutes before anyone even greeted me.  Let me say it was not busy at all so why the hostess was not at the door is beyond me.  Upon being asked if I needed help, I was directed to the bar to place my to-go order.  There were 2 bartenders working, about another 3 minutes goes by before they even greeted me.  They did look at me, but went on about their conversation.  Finally one came up to me and asked if I needed something, I mentioned a to-go order again.. I finally received a menu and was ready to order about 30 seconds later (I love hooters, I always have to ask my husband if we can go. haha) I  was able to watch about 5 plays in the Sunday night football game before the girl came back to take my order.  When I finally ordered, the service was fast.  The kitchen had my order out in no time.  The girl was relatively friendly, but the wait time for not being busy really nerved me.  Once I paid and left a 20% tip, I didn't even get a \"thank you\" or \"have a good night\"  I worked in the service industry for quite some time and the level of customer service I received that night was not up to par, not even close.  The food was good tho.  Kudos to the kitchen staff that night."}
{"text":"Always wanted to go here, just because I have heard so much about it. The food was good, and the service was outstanding. Waitress was very friendly, and she checked in with us several times during the meal. Fries had absolutely no flavor, but the hamburgers were good, and the prices were reasonable. We would go there again.  There was a group of obnoxious women next to us who had clearly had too much to drink.  They were super loud and definitely detracted from our meal. There were way too many empty beer bottles on the table, clearly they should have been cut off a bit earlier!!"}
{"text":"The bacon-wrapped chicken wing!  Obviously there's a genius somewhere in Hooters that put these two awesome things together.  Also had the Daytona wings which were good too!  Service was good, food was good, Brenna was our server - she was nice too.  Good experience and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Today, I ordered take out.  Daytona breaded wings and Hot wings. The pieces were large this time, cooked perfectly.  The celery was larger stalks and crispy.  Those are the things we expect at Hooter's."}
{"text":"I think the friendliest person is the bartender, whatever her name is.  The rest are there for a paycheck, and probably think that they should get a good tip because they have skimpy clothes and most guys are desperate and fawn all over them.  Nothing worse than self-entitlement.    People go out for entertainment.  And part of your job as a waiter/waitress is to be outgoing, to socialize.  The couple of girls that waited on me seem lack this skill.    The most annoying thing about this place is the \"We ID everyone regardless if they are on an oxygen tank, in a wheel chair, full head of grey hair, more creases and wrinkles than a Sharpe (dog) and wearing a World War I hat.\"  Seriously?  How stupid.  I'm not going back simply because of such stupidity.  Next is their over priced beers.  $5 dollars for a 16 oz beer?  Ridiculous.  There's TONS of places that have more to offer than this chain on both beer and food, and at a better price.  If you want an awesome variety of beers, check out the Whining Pig or Pigs Meow."}
{"text":"One example of the terrible service we received...we had to ask 4 different waitresses for plates.  You would think plates were assumed as necessary.  But, that was after the lazy little hostess laid the menus down on a table and just walked away.  The 2 stars are for the food, which is good like all the others.  Do yourself a favor and go to another location."}
{"text":"We used to go to Hooters all the time back in our home town.  It was great we met up with friends and the food was great.  We moved to Vegas and haven't really gone.  I think mostly because they aren't close to our house and we have 2 little girls.  It was a Saturday night and I asked my wife if she wanted to go?  She said sure.  This is what I have come to expect from every Hooter's I have even been too.  The service sucks!  Yes, I said it.  I lower the bar a lot when I go to a Hooters.  In fact they should just have the girls walk around and do nothing.  I will get my own refill and place my own order at a window.  Why? because I really like the wings.  I think they're great.  So when we went to this Hooter's I wasn't surprised when our waitress just disappeared for a long time.  In fact the table next to us moved and got a new waitress.  Back to the food.  the wings were great and my wife ordered a Philly Cheese steak.  The kids meals were not overpriced either.  My daughter got a grilled cheese.  We went in got our food and took off.  It was great!  So a rule of thumb.  I am pretty sure Hooter waitresses hate families,  (They like dumb guys who tip them for crappy service.) and the service sucks.  If you like wings and curly fries then go to Hooters! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my place to come and watch all the games and fights. Always nice people pretty nice patio outside and the crowd is live!!"}
{"text":"Best waitress ever named Bobbi great service. Wings deal for all you  can eat and they had avariety of flavors  very good!!!!"}
{"text":"The most HORRIBLE fish & chips I have EVER tasted....foul oil, super greasy & rancid taste!!!! Of I could give them 0 stars I most definitely would. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"We will never go to this place again we waited over 1 1/2 hours to get our food and never got it. They forget to get us drinks and if it wasn't for my wife to ask some one for a soda we would of still be waiting the manager was a coward and a lier saying he'll have our food right out if we wait we did wait for 20 mins and never seen him or our food it's such a bad place to go too the waitress was such an ass with us it was the worst experience ever"}
{"text":"Slow service. Esp after we stopped ordering drinks. Go to the hooters in the palms if you want to hit one up in vegas....  Food was warm and typical hooters food. Waitress didn't seem to care.   Also do not stay at the hotel ...ever. it really is terrible!"}
{"text":"Good, reliable-ish food.  The food was decent, the service was nice but lacking.  I got what I expected.  The Chili Cheese Fries were UBER salty."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here today and the food was great. My husband had the \"breakfast sandwich\" with bacon and I had the French Toast. Both were nice portions of food. The manager Earnest, was very friendly and accommodating and went above and beyond our expectations. If HOOTERS had a Earnest in EVERY department you would DESTROY your COMPETITION! Our server Alyssa was good."}
{"text":"This was the worst Hooters I have ever been to!!!! Took forever to get seated & when we did the manager was the rudest jerk(not the exact word I want to use). Took forever for our waitress to take our order. Drinks arrived about 15 mins later.....food took 45 mins. Came cold!!!! Had to ask several times for refills of our ice tea. Asked for ranch & was brought one small container 1/2 full. Got attitude from the manager when I asked for more. We actually ended up leaving...without eating!!!"}
{"text":"The beer was very flat. Produce a very large amount of foam when the girl poured it out of the tap which is a sign of warm beer. The Proprietors need to invest in a much cooler system to operate here in the hot summers. The servers are very nice and the food is very good."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I keep going back here. The service was pretty bad this time around and the food was worse. I ordered steak quesadillas and they were filled with steakum! Wtf? THe only thing that Hooters can make edible is their Buffalo Shrimp. Carolina Pavilion desperately needs another sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food....it's always good. I mean they're not whipping five star cuisine back there, so don't expect that. We're talking about fried and/or grilled eats, simple and cheap. You get what you order. I always get the chicken sandwich. Always good and served with a pickle and some coleslaw. My better half always gets wings and onion rings, fried and crunchy. Never any complaints about the food.   Now let's talk service....consistently pretty crappy at least this location. If you're eating hot wings, you might want to order a pitcher of whatever you're drinking. I think my cup was empty more than it was full. Plus, I seem to lose my waiter for twenty minutes at a time. The place wasn't even at max capacity and I could barely get my bill once we were done.   Last, but not least the girls.....hottest location in the valley, for sure. Out of all the locations I've visited, which at this point is 3, I do believe, in az, this one has the cutest girls. I have a feeling that ASU being around the corner has something to do with it. lol. The girls are so distracting that it ALMOST made me forget about the crappy service (emphasis on almost).   Tip: sit inside for better service."}
{"text":"We walked in around 8 pm this evening. The restaurant was not busy, in fact, it had more television's than customers. Our beverage order was taking  promptly than the waitress disappeared. After waiting 12 minutes and observing employees engaged in casual conversations we walked out.   The restaurant down the street was happy to assist us with our order and did so timely."}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE! My fiance and I had a bunch of friends in from out of state so we ended up coming here. My friend ordered a bloody mary that took 45 minutes to come to the table, the same friend ordered wings and fries for 6.99 the waitress brought out wings with no fries and stated \"You should have told me you wanted fries\" and rolled her eyes. My friend stated politely \"It is clearly written on the menu that this meal comes with fries\" that took another 20 minutes. The fries were undercooked and awful, my fiance ordered a bbq burger that came with NO bbq sauce. He had to finally track someone down after sitting and waiting for 20 minutes to ask for bbq sauce. The food was awful the habanero wings were not hot at all the burger was dry, and the fries sucked. Throughout this whole experience our waitress didn't check on us once we finally had to track her down for are check which in turn she rolled her eyes and glared at us. Sadly, due to such horrible customer service we didn't tip much which before we leaved she glared and said \"Just so you guys know since you didn't tip I have to pay for you to eat here\" glared and walked away. I am never one to not tip but the service was soooo bad I will not tip my money especially when our waiter is rude and her eye rolling was awful!!! In any case, horrible experience all together a meal that should have taken 45min to an hour was two hours. I wouldn't take anywhere here ever again. Total Rip off with HORRIBLE customer service!"}
{"text":"I honestly think that I'm like one of the only straight girls in the world who likes this place. I love the sports bar atmosphere and their food is really good. I used to order the take-out wings all the time back in the day.  The waitresses are always really nice. I went to a Hooters in California once and our waitress was so rude. You could tell she was a frustrated and annoyed failed actress and was taking it out on her customers. The girls who work at this location are mostly college girls and don't have a bad attitude.   The last time I came here was with my family for my little brothers 13th birthday. The waitress was really nice and attentive. When we asked her if the fried pickles were good (since we hadn't been in years) she said, \"If you like pickles the fried pickles are good.\"  It was the silliest response ever and she instantly realized it and laughed with us. It was just a pleasant atmosphere in general.  They took my brother to the front and made him stand on a chair with balloons stuffed in his shirt while the girls sing him happy birthday. It was really nice of them to go above and beyond the average ice cream with a birthday song. They also gave him a calendar that all the waitresses signed for him.  I have this theory that the only people who don't like Hooters are jealous girls and/or men who would rather be at strip club but their wives won't let them go.  Could have done without the upstairs location though. I'd imagine after having a few drinks it would suck to get out. (Maybe thats the point!)"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon deal for the hotel and hotel gave us coupons for BOGO wings here! My friends and I thought why not give it a try since it's convenient and I've never been to hooters before.  Service: pretty good even though it was somewhat busy! Our waiter Brandy kept checking up on us and constantly gave us water!   Food: we all ordered wings and curly fries. Honestly one of the best wings I've had! It's super crispy and the flavors were good! We got original, garlic parmesan and chipotle honey. I recommend all of it!  The curly fries came with no seasoning but salt does the job!  I definitely recommend coming here if you're staying at the hotel!"}
{"text":"The combination of both beer and wings from hooters makes me sick in the morning I continue to eat there for years. As always the servers fake like they care but that don't bother me as long as a get good service and I do. Plus they are easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"I've tried to give Hooters (in general) multiple chances but they come short every time. This is not because of service (which is wonderful) but the wings themselves.  Every time I come here it feels like the wings are dry and have zero sauce on them.  I normally have to create a mixture of ranch and hot sauce so it feels like I'm getting some flavor.  Like I said, the service is great, we had our fantasy football draft here once and they gave us coupons and some gear which was a nice touch, but the food needs to improve for me to come back."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place if you are NOT HUNGRY OR THIRSTY. Service is as slow as dial up internet service from NetZero. Be ready to wait 10-15 min to get acknowledged and offers something to drink. Then wait another 10min to place your order. So better know what you want so you can order on the first acknowledgement. If you are here for wings Wednesday, you better hope a good manager is on staff or else you'll have the random guy walking around pretending to manage the place that just looks at you when you walk in allowing the girls to run the place to the ground. Sorry for the small tip but tip comes with good service. Please hire a manager to turn this place around!"}
{"text":"Hooters, R.I.P.  You really have been left behind.  Boring menu inferior product, service kinda sucks, and Hooter girls are Diner waitresses.   Training does wonders.  Maybe change the name to Wing-a-Rama."}
{"text":"Horrible service and fruits had fungus in them. When we complained to the manager, his response was that it's not a perfect world. Our waitress kept forgetting stuff and messed up the orders. I wish there was option to give no stars or may be \"negative\" stars."}
{"text":"My parents and I went there and were seated and the waitress,  I'll call her \"missy\", gave us water right away without even asking and I was so excited because that was an awesome way to start our service. She took our orders and left. \"Dixie\" handed our food 15 minutes later which we didn't mind but the wings were bone dry so we asked if we could get some extra sauce. Dixie was very pleasant and said of course and got us some.  When she came back my father wanted some Tabasco but did not wanted to bother dixie anymore we decided to wait for our waitress. I saw \"missy\" 6 times within 15 minutes and could not flag her down. Finally I got up and asked 3 associates at the bar that I needed Tabasco and 3 refills on our water. They were very quick on my request. 5 minutes later missy came by and said \"im sorry I abandoned you guys for a little bit is there anything I can get you?\".   Needless to say this visit was not the best and that is why I am giving two stars.   The food was bad and so was service. I would just like to say no one was rude at all but overall the service and food just killed my night."}
{"text":"Alvin, the manager, what a word I can't say. Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again."}
{"text":"I agree with people expecting this to be a 5 star restaurant it's hilarious. & i also think the girls who have to say something about the girls are usually the really ugly girls. Yeah maybe some of the girls there don't meet your standards but who cares. Shut up and EAT or drink a beer sounds like all you negatives need  beer. Anyway still not my favorite restaurant to eat at but i love the idea of hooters being the original vs all the new competition ex. Tilted kilt,twin peaks."}
{"text":"The wings were great and the beer was cold. My waitress (starts with a K) was gorgeous and friendly. But I'm pretty sure she forgot about me. I had to wait for my bill for almost 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and for the AYCE wings special for $11.99 on Mondays. Considering that we drove about 30 minutes to come just for the food, we we're fairly disappointed. With the purchase of a drink, you get unlimited wings, but the selection of flavours is very limited. As huge fans of wings ourselves, we were disappointed with the taste and at the lack of meat on the bones. They were drenched in sauce too!  If you don't mind the actual quality of the wings and just want to eat as much as you can to satisfy that craving, this deal is worth it for you"}
{"text":"Just watched a guy in a SF Giants cap flip burgers with his glove. Gross."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience girls were not knowledgeable in explaining the menu we got dry wings and when we told the manager he was like I can't do anything now that you ate didn't offer anything on top they charged us extra for ranch that wasn't extra we ordered a 20 pcs wing so we're told basically you get no dipping sauce for your wings, then my wife goes and pays and the get skipped her change cause the bartender said we just round the check so basically keep the change so rude unprofessional this place needs major change not to mention management was not a help at all"}
{"text":"I know, but I had to give it a try.....but, once is enough. I thought I would give Hooters a try, I had an event at the Herberger Theater, it was across the street and I could eat outside. Unimpressed with the menu, ordered a Taco Salad. Now I have had taco salad all over the country.  This one was different. Maybe I did not read the entire explanation of what this dish was, but usually a taco salad is pretty basic and is composed with several basic items. This taco salad had a scant few. It was a pile of shredded lettuce over some cabbage, swimming in a vinaigrette dressing with a sprinkle of cheese, a small scoop of guacamole and sour cream and four taco chips. It was more like a mediocre dinner salad, overdressed with toppings that did not suit what a dinner salad should be....with a couple of taco chips. I said to the waitress that it was a weird taco salad and her reply was....\"oh, yea\".  So, as I said, last trip to Hooters. If I want a dinner salad swimming in dressing I can go anywhere and just order that, get it and it will be better.......although probably still disgusting."}
{"text":"Great food.....Great service.....Great atmosphere!!  Veronica did a great job taking care of my table.  A great place to eat & watch your favorite teams."}
{"text":"Just waited 22 min for service and nothing.. We got set and literally sat there .. Waiting and waiting and waiting .. It wasn't even busy.. Incompetent staff, and terrible service.. From a previous hooters girl, I'm completely disappointed and will never come back. We walked out."}
{"text":"WEAK SERVICE. Janae was the slowest server I have ever had. Food was sub par and that was the best part..."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times over the years. I was walking by the restaurant and I asked the hostess if it would be okay if I used the restroom. She said she couldn't let me in and she wouldn't even ask the manager if it was okay. I will never go there again"}
{"text":"My mother, of all people, was craving Hooters wings.  My girlfriend had never been to a Hooters.  If there was ever a time to go to Hooters its when you Mom is craving it and your girlfriend is open to trying something new. The stars were aligned!  We had, you guessed it, wings.  The medium sauce was really, really mild. Almost flavorless.  My GF had the chipotle honey. They had a little spice to them but were mostly a sweet and tangy sticky sauce.  The sauce reminded me of something from a sesame chicken dish at a chinese buffet. I had the Naked Daytona Beach wings.  They were wings covered in a spicy barbecue sauce then grilled so the sauce would caramelize.  They were actually pretty good.   The service was prompt and friendly.  It was like a trip to B Dubs except the entire staff was 18-25 yr old girls in Hooters outfits."}
{"text":"Yes, I'll say it: I've been to Hooters.  Voluntarily.  And liked it. Kinda.  (*gasp* *boo* *hiss*)  The food is not the attraction. It's ok; the wings are average and the fries often anemic. The 20-something-year old trotting around in post-war nylons, putrid orange shorts, and a caked-on smile isn't the attraction either.  But the availability of seats during game night when actual sports bars are packed? I'm there. I don't have cable. I don't really like sports bars. Go Suns."}
{"text":"So I'm a massive fan of the hooters brand. Across the US it's a fantastic, fun, family oriented chicken wing joint.   Most locations have big delicious wings, not here.   This location buys the small wings and over cooks them so the meat is dry and crunchy.  Their staff are terrible and don't know how to do their job at all, but I guess in Toronto it's hard to find people who will wear the uniform.    I've given this location way too many chances to prove me wrong and after going to a hooters in dallas this week that does everything right, I can comfortably say I'll never go back to this location.     On an all you can eat Monday night it took me 3 hours, and that not cause I ate a lot, it's because they intentionally drag their feet so you can't get refills on your order.      The rooftop patio is pretty great though.   Lol"}
{"text":"Waitresses act like the are runway models and way too good to even serve foods to their customers! I can see the black girl waitress's nipples when she was putting my order in which is disgusting and unprofessional!  Food are gross, tables are nasty and the restaurant stinks! Never going back!"}
{"text":"This place was bad  I came in hooters because of course I love it  This is a tester store  So they try new menus  But here is the weird part I'm  100% Puerto Rican a well respected one  the strange part I'm beginning to believe this is a racist town hello it's 2015  Because there was plenty of seats  But they sat me in the corner in the dark away from everyone instead of where I wanted to sit down  It was very strange and weird and I never felt so uncomfortable in my life although the food was good and my waitress was good  I just could not get this vibe that they put out don't go to this place I would not recommended The most horrible feeling I have ever felt thank you hooters for making me sad on my journey back home"}
{"text":"Happy hour definitely cheaper....sucks they charge extra for ranch when you need more than one small container of ranch for wings!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst food I have had in a long time. The wings were inedible, not the way they were cooked, but because the quality and standard of product is sub par! With chicken blood pockets are to b expected but to bite into a wing that was completely black due to the cooked blood was repulsive!   I am a bartender at a sports bar down the road who has been in this industry for over 10 years and I have never seen nor worked at an establishment that would serve such trash as the wings we ordered. The wings are half the size as the wings I serve at my current bar or any where else I have ordered wings. They are overpriced and would not even think of serving them to my dog!  I will never be back or go to any hooters ever again!"}
{"text":"Usually enjoy going here however trying to phone in an order for pick up and getting hung up on several times is ridiculous. So we walk in to place an order and they are our of certain items. 920pm on a Saturday really poor management"}
{"text":"The girls were so friendly, we had a new girl and she had messed up a few things but the person training her fixed it. I recommend the wings! 911 style yum! Prices are pretty accurate considering the amount of food you get. Oh and the loaded tots are great too."}
{"text":"I've never been to Hooters before until Saturday 5/31. I never went into a Hooters because I was very intimidated of the girls there. To my surprise, they weren't what I thought they were going to be. Nobody acted like they were better than you or prettier to talk to you. They did say seat ourselves which is cool. We didn't wait long until Sarah came and asked us if we wanted to get started with drinks. She was super nice. My beau and I got the Lots of Tots as appetizers and it was AMAZING. I ordered the Daytona Wings breaded. It was good. Wish I asked for naked. GO NAKED. But that's my fault. I ordered also a mango lemonade. BOMB. For a hot summer day, I suggest getting this! I didn't know I could get free refills on this drink, so i was slowly drinking it. I guess Sarah heard me slurping the bottom of the glass and waited for me to put my glass down and immediately grabbed my glass and refilled it! Awesome!! Then beau and I started to leave she asked if I wanted more of the drink. I told her no, we were leaving. She told me we can get a TO-GO cup! DOUBLE POINTS! I loved the atmosphere and the manager checked on us too. I liked it and will be coming back.   One thing though: I wish it wasn't so cold and my food would stay hot longer. But it's probably our fault because who chose where to sit."}
{"text":"This hooters sucks don't order after midnight they will make your wings half ass and then when you complain about the wings being dry they give you some bullshit story about measuring the sauces rather than fixing the problem. Don't eat here or order to go."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome, and you could not ask for friendlier people.   However, I have been coming to this place for about four years. The food quality has been steadily going down hill. The wings and portions are getting smaller and more expensive. The quality of the wings rates to barely edible.   This place needs to get another food vendor, because the quality is horrible. Then retrain the staff to get the order right. The last time I went there, the food was overcooked to the point the meat was dehydrated, greasy, and made my stomach sore for a few days.   The ambiance, and the staff are great. The management needs to get a better food vendor, and have his people step it up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We were finishing a bachelor party trip and stayed at the Marriott across the street just wanted to relax and watch a game a few beers and shots were ordered for 5 people the shots were not what we ordered we just want the right shots and ask for the manager he here's our issue and then states we hit the limit and are done for the night. The limit for 5 people is 35 as he states problem is we had 28 drinks and he still charged us for the shots we didn't ask and booted us. . Don't come here because ultimately if they make a mistake you pay for it"}
{"text":"1/21/16 930pm. We love your chicken wings and we came to your restaurant to splurge and enjoy your menu, there are 4 of us girls then. We were waiting for our husbands because they wanted to drink beer so we planned meet them there. Before we came to your restaurant we went to a coffee shop and had take out left overs, when we arrived at Hooters with our carry out drinks from th coffee place  (they are half way done by the way) they welcomed us and seated us, never questioning our drinks from outside. Then the waitress took our orders without and questions or concerns about the drinks we have, after the order was taken she comes back saying we can't have our drinks from outside in the restaurant so she suggested to just set it aside where no one can see it and we can enjoy it later when we leave, ok everybody happy. Then \"the manager on duty\" came and said that we can't have these drinks here . We are not even touching it and it's hidden on a chair at the corner.He gave us 2 options finish it outside when it's 40F or throw it, because it's their policy. He is very rude and narrow minded, gave us a dissatisfiing attitude and answers. He doesn't know how to compromise for customers satisfaction, does not know how to give reasonable options. Very disappointing. please educate your staff on how to be courteous and reasonable to customers. If he did not give us an attitude then we will not complain and we will obey right away. But he does not know how to provide a good customer service."}
{"text":"First time at Hooters. Since Sheraton didnt carry channel in my room, I was looking for a place that had the USA vs Mexico gold cup final and this place had it. The crowd was into the game too which was nice.  Food is average at best. I had the western bacon BBQ burger with fries and it was just okay.  Service was great. Waitress was super friendly, cute, and a college student. Another college aged waitress stopped by to take away my glass and overheard me talking about disciplining my teenage kids and she joined the conversation with her own story on how her mom took away her cell phone and computer privileges.  Anyways, i was impressed with how friendly the service was. They kept asking if everything was okay, if we needed anything else, extra water, etc. Maybe we got a good table near the food prep area and this made it convenient for waitress to come by often.  The bottom line is that you go to hooters for the sports, drinks, and waitresses but not really for the food."}
{"text":"So, I decided to put my feminism on hold for a couple of hours, as per my friend's request to have AYCE wings. Upon walking in, it was exactly what I expected it to be: scantily clad women wearing push-up bras, orange booty-shorts, and tan stockings to hide any 'imperfections'; kitschy 90's style signage; dude-bros with lust in their eyes, etc.  We decided to proceed to the roof-top patio, which was quite nice--probably this establishment's only redeeming quality.  The wings were bland. I've had many-a-wing in my day and these were the worst. Perhaps they serve the bad wings on AYCE day and the good ones on regular days? I'll never know, as I will never be back. To expand, they were tiny, with very little meat (I couldn't help but wonder if the chickens that the wings were sourced from were malnourished). They were haphazardly sauced, rather than tossed. The flavours that I tried were truly uninspiring (Habenero Bbq, Daytona Beach and Chipotle Honey); meh on all counts.  Now, onto the brews. As a recovering Beer Snob, I try to keep an open mind at these types of establishments. However, I cannot stand for dirty taps. We had Rolling Rock and Shocktop. RR should be crisp, light, highly carbonated; it was murky and pretty flat. Shocktop tasted like orange Kool Aid (Oh yeeAAA)  #gross. Now, the fact that both pitchers were nearly $25.00 each was shocking and frankly I should have said something when the Rolling Rock came over looking like a wheat beer. I was trying not to be a snob and my compatriots were okay with it, so I drank it like medicine and enjoyed the ride.  Overall, it was a piss poor experience. I'm just glad I spent it with good company, also they happened to showing Play Fair on their many t.v.s (that's what was on TSN at the time) so rather than one star, I will bestow 2 for irony.  I would recommend this place to individuals who have low standards in regards to food & drink. This is also an excellent place for people who would like to go to a strip club, but are too shy to deal with the impropriety that comes with it."}
{"text":"Worst Hooter's I have been to........ When we walked in, it took a minute to be greeted since the Hostess was buried in her phone...   When we were seated, the menus looked like they were put through a storm and were gross and sticky.... It took forever for our waitress to come over and take our drink order, so long that we had already figured out what we wanted to eat AND what we wanted to eat as an appetizer ...   We got our appetizer, Buffalo Chicken Dip which was EXCELLENT and I highly recommend it. We needed a refill on drinks and and finished the appetizer before she even came back to check on us. Our waitress, Arielle, didn't even come back and make sure everything came out okay and see if we needed anything else.    The next time we saw our waitress, she was brining us our food.  She finally got us refills and checked to see if the food came out okay, and then she disappeared again.  The food was excellent and cooked to perfection, hence the 2 stars. She came back soon after to let us know she was leaving and someone else would take over and then ran off before we could tip her, which honestly wouldn't be much since she obviously didn't care about us or the tip. The next waitress was better, but still didn't care to make sure we were taken care of, when we were one of two groups in the ENTIRE place...   All the other Hooter's I have ever been to , the girls are ALWAYS attentive, bring refills before you are done with your first round, they talk to you and check on you and make you feel welcome, even when its a crowded fight night. THIS Hooters made you feel like you weren't welcome and that we would have been treated better at McDonalds....   I used the bathroom before we left and boy I should have used a truck stop bathroom.... Every time I went to get toilet paper, the ENTIRE toilet paper holder would FALL on me........ How did it fall on me since it's against the wall you ask??? The entire front part would fall open and its heavy and hurt terribly and since the stall is extremely small, you can't avoid getting hit.... The bathroom looked like Hellen Keller tiled it and put it all together... The plumbing is terrible and can't even flush the toilet to get a small wad of paper down the hole..   I will NOT be back , which really makes me sad considering how much I enjoy their food...."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Took wayyy tooo long to get our food, then to get ranch for our wings even longer, refills were horrible we were thirsty most of the time...."}
{"text":"Service wasn't good.  And my $5 margarita was bad. The hostess sucked.  OK, service was awful here.  I did like my Daytona shrimp.  Could've spent this meal somewhere else though."}
{"text":"This place gives me super powers - invisibility! Where else can you sit for 15 minutes, not be acknowledged, have two servers and one manager walk within 15 feet, and never  acknowledge that you exist or might thirsty.  The best part? I gain this super power on nearly every visit.  I really can't understand how this place stays in business. I really try to patronize it here, but they certainly don't respect their customers."}
{"text":"just went to hooters tonight to eat.  I have not been to one in about ten years and after tonight I might not ever go again.  Service was terrible and nobody acted like they cared at all. food was good but the bad service and waiting for a drink refill and the check and seeing my server looking like she didn't care was really upsetting.  If you get better servers who care and don't just put on a act I might be back but I doubt it.  The server WAS ROSIE BY THE WAY.  thanks for nothing. will not return ."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has happened to Hooters over the years, these restaurants used to have fantastic wings and great personalities overall. I stopped in this location about 11:30 AM only 11 other people and myself in the place at the time. I ordered the original hot wings with blue cheese and when they got to me they Were Luke warm, and the breading was somewhat soggy.  I am not sure if the cooks I just cooking ahead and trying to reheat them as the orders come in for the young man expediting orders just let them sit there it's amazing because I watched other people screwed sit there while he waited on the server to come get it even though no server came he just stood there leaning up against the counter no sense of urgency or pride. Hooters used to be a great place for a cold beer and some great wings unfortunately probably my last trip."}
{"text":"First time at a Hooters...last time at Hooters. Pleasant server...horrible food. Wings were tasteless and greasy. Hubby had the Po' Boy. All batter and bland. Unless you are in need of seeing scantily clad servers, don't bother."}
{"text":"This Hooters was very dirty. The tables, the silverware, the floor and restrooms.  Usually our is spot on at any Hooters we go to... not this time. Our order was messed up and she tried to get us to just keep what she brought.  The reorder took forever."}
{"text":"This place sucks! I came for lunch and it was not busy. However it seems like the bartenders just didn't care to serve me. Took me 10 mins to flag down a bartender to take my order..."}
{"text":"One of the better hooters I have been to in the Midwest!  The interior is large with tons of seating came here to watch the Cubs wild card game and the Hawks opener. Didn't have the Hawks on any tv but our waitress gladly changed 2 of the Tvs so we could watch both the cubbies and the Hawks. Hooters wings are the same wherever you go. The fries were cold which was a bummer because our food came out in like 5 minutes. Also the \"talent\" of this hooters is top notch, I feel like some hooters have gotten lazy with who they hire and I will say this one had a great group of friendly ladies.   Expensive draft beer, plus they brought me a bud lite when I ordered a Budweiser but I know it's just so hard to keep those 2 straight. Still beats going to an over crowded crappy service Buffalo Wild Wings, I'll be back again I'm sure."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a Friday night with a few coworkers for a little HH action. Even though I live only a couple of miles away, I have never been to this Hooters. Needless to say I will never go back! The place was less than half full but it took nearly 20 minutes to get our first  drinks. Every  beer mug had a chip and the beer was flat and warm. We sent the chipped mugs back only to wait  another  20 minutes to get replacements.  The new mugs had chips on the rims with sharp edges! We ordered a couple of appetizers and they actually  came out in about  10 minutes.  Really bad food. Hardly edible. We decided to go  somewhere else and when we got our checks, they over charged and double charged us! They begrudgingly credited us and comped a couple of bottled beers. Big woop! We spent $150 in there and thdy acted like we were lucky to experience  their crappy service. The single worst bar I have ever been to.  With so many other choices  in the area, avoid this place at all costs. We walked to the Tilted kilt and it was like going from hell to heaven.....great service, cold beer with many more choices and the food was pretty damn good too! Getting ready to yelp review them 5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"Food was good. Staff was friendly and helpful. Service started off slow but eventually picked up and was an enjoyable outing. Restaurant atmosphere was great for our large group in attendance.  Can't go wrong with wings and drinks!"}
{"text":"Good food... Great environment... Hot servers!  The food here is good but not great as can be expected from a hooters. However, this location is in the heart of Mill Street which is the center for social living in ASU and the greater Phoenix area. I enjoy sitting at the tables on the deck of the second level where you can enjoy the scenic view of the mountains and the passers by. This location also has the most attractive servers than any other Hooters Ive been to so that's another plus. You wont be disappointed with your experience here."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. We had someone who was under 21 years old so they stuck us at a corner area of the restaurant even though the whole place was empty. The waitresses were more concern about how rounchy they looked than give great service. We had to ask several times to get our water refilled. We will probably won't be back there again. If I can give a zero rating, I would have. Sorry Hooters maybe you can be a little bit more friendly and inviting to new comers."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times. I stopped by here and watch one of the FIFA finals this year - cold beer, patio, and short shorts!"}
{"text":"I personally like this Hooters. Granted, the girls aren't always mind-blowingly hot (although most are good looking), but they are some of the friendliest around.   This one is also in a great location for being close to everything in Tempe but parking is an issue and is metered so make sure you have change.  For being right next to ASU campus, it isn't the liveliest Hooters I've been to, but it fits the bill and offers nice scenery and edible food."}
{"text":"A red-blooded American male does NOT go to Hooters to dine; he goes there to STARE.  Butt, all joking aside (did I just misspell the word \"but?\"  I must have been distracted; forgive me...), the food really is terrific, and the \"babes\" are just awesome.  Whenever one of their lovely servers approaches my table and purrs, \"What would you like to drink?\" I can't help but respond with, \"Milk...\"  My advice is that no man should go there, ALONE.  Take a buddy with you, so you will have someone to witness you making a total jackass of yourself, based on your \"high school hormones.\""}
{"text":"This is an ok place. The sever was obnoxious. Pretzel bites were raw. The wings were cold. Will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak and it was just okay. I really wished they would have grilled the peppers. My husband was extremely disappointed in his food. He was served a chicken sandwich with no truce of toppings. He notified the Waitress that the fries were cold, and rather than giving a new fresh side of fries, they sprinkled a few hot fries on top. There wasn't many people in the restaurant so we are unsure why the quality of food was so poor."}
{"text":"I have no excuse for being a patron here one quiet Monday evening. Well, my excuse was that Champions in the Marriott hotel across the street was serving me poorly (charging me for beers they didn't bring) and I didn't want to walk around Uptown too much for another pint of suds. I had some Sierra Nevada on tap and watched UFC fighting for the first time. Scary stuff! The \"eye candy\" here wasn't all that appealing, or perhaps I wasn't in the mood. After all, it was a Monday night."}
{"text":"We came in here in a Saturday 7/18/15 around 5:45 pm we were seated and soon after greeted by our waitress.  I wish I could remember her name.  She has the sweetest personality, all the other ladies that we encountered were up beat, happy to be working.  You could tell the way they carried themselves they were hard workers.  I guess being that it's brand new, they've had a lot of hiccups, she was asking how the food was when we noticed how fantastic she really was. Usually nobody ever asks!  She made us feel so welcomed.  I didn't have any complaints about the food or staff.  This location is facing the pool so you may want to check it out when it's cool day with a light breeze.  Personally I enjoy not being stuck in the A/C because then you have to eat it before it gets cold. This didn't happen here since it's all facing the outside pool area.  NOT a place for kids since their bar is literally right there in the seating area (the other half is not open). I can't believe somebody had kids in here with all the video poker being so close by...   I can't wait to come back again! We had a lot of fun, we didn't drink alcohol we had a fun time with the staff and music."}
{"text":"First we always order CURLY FRIES with cheese to start. The food & cheese sauce came out hot.   Today my boneless  mild wings were the bomb, food just came out. Golden yellow and just super juicy. Moist enough to fall apart in your mouth.  Delicious buttery breaded wings.  Breeana is favorite waitress she has a great sense of humor. Smart and remembers us by face every time we see her."}
{"text":"What do you do on a Wednesday when you have two hours to kill before work? You treat yourself to a decent meal, of course! So, while I was running some late morning errands at the Pavilions shopping center in Scottsdale, I was reminded that this Hooters had recently opened up!  Now, if you've ever been to a Hooters before, they typically all look the same. However, being a new place, this particular Hooters is quite a bit nicer than the restaurants I've seen in the past.   The whole place feels very open. It probably has something to do with the fact that the front of the building is made up almost completely of windows http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#EIXDzWZ9dQaeOBa8OwtBXA. It might have also helped that it was noon, and exceptionally bright outside. (NOTE: Sitting near these windows at high noon can be almost TOO bright. Try and sit in a section not facing the windows until later in the afternoon or into the evening).  When I entered the building, the hostess greeted me with a chipper, \"HI! WELCOME TO HOOTERS!\" which was immediately followed by a CHORUS of echos from every other waitress in the building. It caught me off guard to be greeted by so many people at the same time...almost like I had just walked into my own surprise party.  I met my waitress, Kimberly, and she escorted me to my seat. She was one of the most chipper people I've encountered in quite some time. Upon arriving at my table, I noticed that Kimberly had placed a napkin at each of her tables that had her name on it, adorned with hearts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#KOhdogn1LHO99Rh_acBnZw. Personally, I thought that this was a really cool touch.  After I sat down, Kimberly asked me if I was there for Hooters' \"All You Can Eat Wings Wednesday\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#o3X4gzNiSR3HX_TISI9jhA. She was surprised to hear me decline (hey...I still had things to do after this meal!).   Instead, I opted for the Baja Burger. MAN this thing is delicious! It's a nice thick burger topped with Monterey Jack Cheese, Salsa, and Guacamole http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#lROUi_7rwe__S1Q1msJQdQ. I always have my burgers cooked \"medium\". To me, it keeps the burger nice and juicy. Today's encounter was no different. SUCH a delicious burger!  As I was enjoying my meal, I took a look around the restaurant. The set up is quite nice. The bar is fully stocked with liquor and beer. But one of the coolest features (besides the four televisions I saw on MY side of the bar) was the bank of frozen drinks on tap. I counted 10 different frozen concoctions http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#AzPr7Vpt0XQnnZF6TtpQpQ.   I opted to sit in the corner of the restaurant, just so I could take a look at the whole restaurant. As I sat, I counted all of the televisions I could see from my section. I think I counted upwards of 20, though there were some TVs on the other side of the bar, I'm sure. Of those 20 televisions, I could physically see the pictures clearly of 13 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#PZRIMs2lvJel7FaGqUxfOA. It looks like this place could be a GREAT place to come and watch whichever sport tickles your fancy.  One last thing. If you're worried about seating, fear not. Besides the bar area, the tall tables along the front wall of windows, and the tall tables strewn throughout the, there are booth seats as well. Now, I know that's typical of ANY restaurant. But, these booths are a little different.   It looks as though this location is trying to maximize viewing angles for their entertainment Mecca. The seating for each booth actually wraps around into the next set of booths http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g?select=QAZc_ZBCj2W6IGQkJ59Ipg#YW2g8Dj6_47O-meQcDfQwA. This seating will, undoubtedly increase people's ability to view more TV's at once...though, sitting with your legs directly into the path of the waitresses and the other patrons MIGHT cause issues...especially after a few beers!  So, WELCOME, Hooters of Scottsdale! I'm sure we will be seeing more of one another in the months to come!"}
{"text":"As far as hooters go its pretty good. One of my guilty pleasures, and one that i rarely allow myself to indulge in is wings, (I worked hard to lose weight yaknow! So I enjoy my vices in moderation) The flavor was as good as other locations, the service was steller, everything was just fine, just trashy enough to be a Hooters, but not so overboard as to make me uncomfortable.  But the wings, one proud, juicy and huge, were now average sized, and they seemed to skimp on the sauce in order to sell containers of additional sauce on the side. , and not just the blue cheese, i mean the flavoring.... all in all, it was good quality, but cutting corners like this while still charging premium prices makes me wonder how long this location will remain open.  Is this what happened to Superstition Springs?"}
{"text":"After the Quacker mess up, we stopped at hooters next. The service was ok the food good and the manager made the wing order right. Even stopped back by to make sure we were good. Its a nice place for drinks and wings."}
{"text":"First, I ordered off at UberEats 10pcs chx wings & asked for the extra dressing (even paid for it). Then when I got my food I only got 9 pcs chx wings with no extra dressing. So I called them and talked to the manager, I think his name is Eric(the one w the long black hair). I called them at exactly 1:50pm and told me that they're gonna give me another set of chx wings in about 10 mins. I gave them time I left my house at 2pm got there 2:10pm and told me to wait another 5 mins. 5 mins has passed became 10 then 20mins he just handed me the order and didn't even smile and didn't even apologize. Actually even the hostess Sabrina, cant actually remember the name but I know it starts with an S, who answered the phone even gave me attitude and said maybe I didn't pay for the extra dressing then I told her I did ! And she couldn't say anything more. I've been ordering to-gos at this location ever since but this is the baddest service i've had ! I wish I could even give them less than 1 star."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the Hooters experience while in Vegas,  skip the \"casino\" and come here. Less of a shady operation....Friendlier service, and no \"trailer trash\" customers walking around."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on New Years day to enjoy some good wings and watch the Raptors game. We made reservations in case it got busy. I guess because it was New Years day, it wasn`t too busy. A fair amount of seating at this location with many tv screens- great for watching different sports. Yes, the Canadian version of Hooters isn`t the same as the American version.I love coming here on Mondays as they have All You Can Wings for $14.99 with a purchase of a beverage. If you get a pitcher of beer, it qualifies for 3 people in this offer. We ordered a pitcher to share and got the AYCE Wings special. You do get fries nor a dip as you have to pay for these separately. They got roughly about 12 different flavours ranging from sweet, mild to hot. My favourite ones were the Chipotle Honey, Daytona Beach and the Cajun flavours. The size of chicken wings is your standard size for chicken wings. We got our orders in a timely manner. The wings are pretty good. My only small critique about the wings is they were tossed in cold sauce and you can taste the wings like they were cold. The wings were served warm rather than hot but still good. I think I must have eaten roughly 40 wings. For $15, you get your money`s worth.  I think they should turn on the volume for the Raptors game but they didn`t. Overall, pretty good place to enjoy a decent food and watch sports. They also have food and drink specials here and there. Will definitely be back especially on Mondays for their wings!!"}
{"text":"Stinky and dirty. Just gross! Room ok Bathtub stained looked dirty. I laid a towel down in the shower because I did not want to touch the tub. Wore my socks in the room.... just smelly"}
{"text":"This is a good sized sports bar that doubles as a restaurant. Great place for the guys. Clean. Professional, and responsible staff tend to your needs. (No, I'm not just talking about the beautiful hostesses) the kitchen staff, and management staff obviously work very hard to maintain a smooth running restaurant. Service is a little on the slow side, but then they are with you, they are with you. They focus on making you feel welcome, and special. The food is delicious and well priced. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Do not come here for the service. They did not bring out my complete order, which was a small appetizer plate. It took them half an hour to bring it back out to me. No apology whatsoever, no offer to make it right."}
{"text":"Good service, good wings. Good full bar with daiquiris from fat Tuesdays. Only curley fries I enjoy. Added addtl wing sauce flavors."}
{"text":"I have to say this Hooters is probably the best hooters I got to visit in my many many Hooters visits around the country. We were actually there the night they opened this one and we became regulars for several years.   Food is always good and service is consistent. The gals were always friendly and helpful.   Wish my California (DUBLIN) Hooters would take a page out the Arizona (PEORIA) location's \"how to be a in the hospitality business\" book.   Miss this location!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Hooters normally, but my best friends sister use to work here. So he knows all the girls, and there is nothing bad about getting mobbed by hot hooter chicks coming by your table to say hi, when your eating your chicken salad. Special shout out to our server Danielle L. Thanks for a great start to our night."}
{"text":"This last trip to hooters just reminds me as to why I never want to come here. We came here because my brother in law came into town and he wanted do the all you can eat wings for $12.99 on Wednesdays. The wings take forrrrrreeeevvveerrr to come out, the first batch we got didn't come out til 30 min later after we ordered, so as soon as we got our first order we decided to place our next order since it takes a lifetime to get. The second batch came out within 15 minutes, but of course they got our orders wrong so we had to wait another 15 minutes for the right ones to come out. During this time we just didn't feel like eating anymore, the food just took wayyyy too long to come out."}
{"text":"The wings are terribad. The servers are nice people though! And they're open all hours of the night so it's got that going for them. Lotsa-tots are aite. $6 rita has got more sugar than a southern belle debutante. probably should go when you're super hammered."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed  I came in and there was no greeter, the manager ended up asking me, then finally sat down had to wait for a drink, one of the girls walked by and asked if I had a drink order I said no. The a mother one came and ask me my drink order and got it, then another came and took my food order, after a wile, then some one els brought my main order first, then 10 min in my appetizer arrived. I had a total of 6 different people one and serve me. Who do I Tip ??? It was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"BUMP BUMP BUMP   We sat in the bar area on a cocktail table & we were not greeted for a while... so we went up to the front host stand area & then they finally got some menus to us & got us started.   I think LILLY was our server. She was super sweet & very attentive. I can be very needy as the bois have already mentioned to her... but she was able to get me everything I needed. I would have to say the drinks always took the longest though... I wasn't paying too much attention around me because the game was on... so couldn't determine if it was because of the bartender or if it was the server...  Food is just bar food here... but I ALWAYS love to get my steamed shrimps from here!  CURLY FRIES $2.99 - they were a bit under cooked & cold   20 PIECE WINGS $20.99 - we got half naked & half battered. The wings were cooked to perfection & I would expect nothing less of a place that is known for their wings. Although... we did get the sauces on the side.. it was said that the garlic hot sauce was the 2nd hottest sauce but it seemed like the same level of spice as the original hot sauce.   BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD $10.99 - greens w/ onions, bleu cheese, Bacon, tomato, & ranch dressing. I would have to say it is very LITTLE amount of chicken on there... a bit disappointing & barely any Bacon.  1/2 LB. STEAMED SHRIMP $14.59 - never disappoints & cooked to the PERFECT juicy texture.  ONION RINGS $7.29 - ummm definitely not worth the price... but it was good.  CARAMEL FUDGE CHEESECAKE $5.49 - wouldnt ever get a dessert here again... ahahhhah not really worth the price but it wasn't that bad in taste."}
{"text":"Our waitress looked like a meth addict last time I went.   Which wouldn't normally bother me since I don't primarily go to Hooters to stare at waitresses' body parts, except that she was also rude. It really seemed like, for some reason, she had decided to hate me and the perfectly nice friend I was with.   We did nothing to deserve this. We were both friendly, in cheerful moods, and we are both normal (some *might* even say good) looking 30something guys. Our troubles first began when my friend asked if the buffalo chicken strips came with any sauce (blue cheese, ranch, whatever). She gave him a dirty look and said, \"Uh, well, the chicken strips come with chicken.\"   We also ordered fries with a little mini-container of cheese sauce. The cheese sauce ran out pretty quickly. We asked for one more mini-container-thing. And she told us they were out. This really aggravated me after having to deal with her rudeness for the previous 45 minutes.   As we finished, my friend had the gall to ask her for a glass of water. She gave him an obvious look of irritation and said ok. Ten minutes later, she came out with the bill and plunked it on our table. My friend, being more polite than she deserved, said simply, \"Oh and could I also have a glass of water please?\" She just walked away from the table and only with her back to us did she again respond with an annoyed, \"Sure.\"   Responding to some of the other amusing reviews, I come to Hooters now and then only because I live downtown. It's open late and has eats. Not good eats, but eats. This has got to be the weirdest Hooters I've ever been to though. Doesn't the meth addict image clash with their corporate philosophy or something?  EDIT: I've upgraded this from one to two stars for the time-being. I sent an excerpt from this review (I left out the part about meth addicts) to the Hooters website, and a regional manager called and talked to me for 20 minutes. He apologized, and was very sincere in expressing his own frustration that a downtown resident of all people would get such poor service. We had a pretty fascinating conversation after that regarding the history of this Hooters: it was the first Hooters in the Valley (1990!), and at one time the 5th busiest one in the nation. But downtown went through a major decline in the mid to late 90s and this location suffered both in terms of attracting customers and employees as a result. Hot chicks want to work in Tempe, Scottsdale and Ahwatukee where they live or go to school, so persuading them to work in what was then the ghetto of downtown was tough. Hooters is hanging on to this location despite such poor business because of its belief that downtown is going to pick up, and especially because of the Sheraton that's going up right across the street.   With all that said, I have to say that I'm a huge supporter of downtown businesses, and even though this is a chain restaurant, the company invested in downtown back when no one else wanted to and has stuck through ever since. That counts for something.   Two stars for now. Hooters is sending me some gift certificates so I'll go again, see how my experience is, and revisit then.  EDIT 2: I got a very very very generous gift certificate in today's mail (8/29), along with a very nice personal letter from the regional manager. Since my review's only genuine complaint about this Hooters was the service, the warm and fuzzy feelings the company's attention to my complaint has given me are themselves worth bumping this up to 3 stars for now. The manager told me, as he did when we spoke on the phone, that they are doing the best they can to improve things. It's clear to me that it will take some time. So I'll give them a break and continue going there, with patience and sympathy for their plight."}
{"text":"The wings are awesome , just some tips on the annual AYCE wings day, please avoid. We are regulars and it literally took about 1 hr to get a ten piece of wings. We ordered some beer to kill the time and all the ice melted in the beer bucket by the time the wings arrived. Then a 2nd order of 5 wings never came, so we wound up paying and will never return for AYCE wing day."}
{"text":"Jazz always gives the best service! The food is off the chain and always a good time!"}
{"text":"I'm slowly becoming a fan of the breaded hooters wings. The 3 mile sauce isn't very spicy, but it has good flavor. The loaded tots are awesome. Probably the best thing on their menu. The staff is friendly waitresses come around quite often to refill drinks. Good spot for lunch"}
{"text":"We ordered take out... and just about everything was wrong.  First... we ordered a Grilled Chicken Salad and either they accidently put fish on instead of chicken OR they had a very fishy grill, because the protein was so strong fish smell that we thought it might have been fish.    We ended up throwing it away.  Disgusting!!!!    Then we ordered wings, and somehow they forgot to sauce the wings at ALL.   Unbelievable.    We ordered like $90 in Food take out and practically couldn't eat any of it as is.     I am so frustrated that a place like this can operate this way!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hardest crust on wings, my dentures popped out--------Worst wait staff, slow as hell. We made the mistake (party of six) doing 5 separate checks. It was the waitresses idea,  got home and realized she attached an $8.00 automatic 20 percent gratuity to each persons check. This is after I had to chase her down all over the joint to give her an additional eight dollar tip.  Where in this universe does Hooters hiring staff find All tiny, skinny, rail thin Black Barbies dolls with absolutely no tits & ass nor hips, nor personalities, they only exist in Hooters world. Thank you."}
{"text":"/always the best servers and hospitality, the young manager is great too. Eat your wings there because if you carry out they will be soggy and mushy as all heck.  I voted no for kids, because if you sit anywhere next to the bar where all the straight jocks are watching the games you will hear the F-bomb, The Fag bomb, the Biache bomb...not really conducive for kids .... Keep up the great work Hooters."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Hooters in the valley I ordered a appetizer chips and dip the cheese looks like they poured it out of a can and warmed it up ordered a side order of hot wings no flavor no taste talk to the waitress and she could've cared less I would've been better off going to Circle K and buy in nachos it would've been the same quality"}
{"text":"Bad food bad service the waitress and manager refused to fix it so we left hungry not the first time this has happened at this location but it is the last time."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service! Visiting out of town for the Super Bowl with family! We ordered over phone 50 wings and we showed up 10mins before pick up time. The girl was very rude saying \"omg what's the name!?\" It was under my boyfriends name. She said our order wasn't ready yet! 20mins later our wings are finally ready! We go through them and none of them have the sauces we ordered! The girls were very rude as they stomped back in the kitchen. We take them back to our family's house and the wings taste horrible! Let's just say we will NEVER come back to that one! The hooters in Vegas is the best! The girls looked like they were 15 years old and acted like it too! Vegas hooters girls are way nicer and hotter! Hire girls that don't look under age!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates .... called store to ask for blue cheese and ranch to be added to my order to dip wings.  Wings delivered, no dressings delivered.  For 17 bucks ++, we could have ordered McKoys"}
{"text":"Tons of cute Hooter's girls, but I've been there twice since moving to Champaign and it seems like their wings consistently lack any crunch, even soggy. Everything tastes fine, just missing some texture."}
{"text":"This hooters is great. I haven't really had many bad experiences with this location.  95% positive experience with the food. Fried pickles, flappertizer daytona or hot, cobb salad that i get all turkey if course, shrimp spinach salad omg, and my absolute favorite BUFFALO SHRIMP for my spicy seafood lovers. These are great. I usually get them hot but I decided to try them Daytona style  today andtake home some chicken dip and they are still great. The have recently added a buffalo chicken dip to the menu that i also cannot resist. Service is really good as well. Some waitresses and bartenders better than other but pretty good overall. Also they are conveniently located near me. They duo get busy at times and so have an outside deck. I like to sit at the bar and watch the numerous flat screens hanging everywhere.  I shall be back."}
{"text":"Ive been to a few Hooter restuarants and have not been impressed, but I have to say this one changed my mind. We had a group of 25 people so at first I didnt expect the service to be all that great, but I was pleasantly surprised with the great service we had. The ladies were very friendly, fun, and attentive. We had a fun crowd so Im not sure if that help open up the fun atmosphere and the waitresses. We all cracked jokes and they welcomingly chimed in, making for a fun experience .  As far as food goes, it was actually pretty good. First I had the naked hot wings that lived up to the hype. They were very good. Then I had the bacon chesse burger which was good as well.  All in all my experience here was fun and memorable."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years. Angelica our server was attentive and friendly. The food came out in a timely matter and was yummy. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a new location and the biggest location I have ever been to. It's inside the Palms Hotel and attached to the pool area.   Hooters is a nice place to eat but this is the best location I have been to. Staff is very frendiley and not stuck up like at some other locations.   If you are staying at the hotel they are also the restaurant used for pool dining."}
{"text":"Smaller area compared to the other Hooters. But has a good bunch of friendly girls serving. The tater tots n cheese stuffed pretzels are a must with a drink! Overall a good place to hangout!"}
{"text":"I've been to this hooters location a couple of times and the food, service and host have always been great.  If you are looking to take your fam for wings here, make sure it's not a UFC fight night.  It's way crazy.  The only negative....  The girls are not that hot."}
{"text":"I ordered a mushroom burger can you have no waiver to it at all and paid extra for the onion rings it was horrible, our Server was very nice.   We will not be eating at Hooters ever again."}
{"text":"While the new beds were oh so comfortable and fulfilled their purpose after my long night of Vegas debauchery, I was very disappointed, and also personally hurt that I didn't receive the order of free wings we were promised at check in.   I am still upset and will continue to hurt every time I return to Vegas and pass by the establishment.   Scars are deep.   However, our floor smelled of French fries when we exited the elevator every time of which I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Had a nice family outing at Hooters, and was overall happy. The Texas burger was decent,  and I liked it on the Texas toast instead of a bun. I made the mistake of having my wings breaded, which is my own fault, but they were still cooked well and tasted good.   The service was good, and we all know what the scenery is like.....two thumbs up!  We found that on Saturday's kids eat free, which may not save a tone of money but it did free up enough to get a couple of beers. They actually have a fairly good selection of beers on tap. All domestics, a bunch of imports, and even some from smaller breweries. I went with the double chocolate and it was GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever had. The waitress didn't know what a Bloody Mary was.. She said is that a shot??  .. Really.. She also said she was new there but still at least study the menu.. And the food was not good either!!! After I ordered the chicken sandwich she comes back and said I can't have pickles on it.. What?? They can't add pickles to my .... And my husband and I both ordered ranch with our fries and by the time we got the ranch the fries were cold .. Was not impressed at all and will not be back.. Very disappointed, management needs to step it up!"}
{"text":"Service was crap, manager guy was kind of an asshole, food was expensive and quality was low."}
{"text":"Always the worst service at this one. Takes these girls forever to do anything. I left last time because I was never greeted at the door! Today, took 10 minutes for her to get a tea! Never busy, I think I know why. It seems you have to be a certain \"type\" to get any attention. Never be back"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I always Have the best time here. Bartenders are on point. Sarah, Tiffany, Lauren and Kristen are great. Great drinks and great service. Tv's are legitness. Sat a table a few times and Courtney kept it consistent. Good food, good drinks = Good time"}
{"text":"I came here on AYCE wings Monday with two friends. We were told to just \"sit anywhere\" and we had to wait for five minutes before they brought us the menu.   AYCE wings were $15 with the purchase of a beverage. My friend and I got a pitcher of beer, whose price was not listed on the drinks menu. We expected it to be around 20 or less, since it was just beer. Turns out, it was $26 for just a pitcher. That was insane pricing.   The hostess made us feel like she hated her job. She was constantly rolling her eyes whilst taking our order and made us feel really unwelcome. Whenever we tried to get a refill, we had to wait for a long time for someone to come, even though there were only 5 tables that were there.   The wings were actually disgusting and saucy. Honey and garlic, barbecue, etc etc. Every sauce was way too sweet and the wings themselves had very little meat.   Also, it was super cold. The heater wasn't on and the door wouldn't close properly.   I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I weren't served for over 30 minutes. The bartender, Natalie just played on her phone and ignored all the customers.  When I ordered the beer, Natalie brought me the wrong order and stated that \"she wasn't talking to us\"! We told the manager about the problem before we left and she just kept making excuses for the girl. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because our waitress was nice and they sang a unique happy birthday song to my friend! However.. food is normal.. drinks didn't taste like they should.. my friend made a reservation and specified that she wanted a table next to a window.. when we got there they didnt know how many we were and wanted to put us next to the wall.. most of the waitresses didn't speak English.. also my friends and I had bigger hooters than any of the waitresses there.. kinda ironic.."}
{"text":"Getting an oil change next door, they said it would be an hour so I stepped into this place to order a Bloody Mary .. It was pre made . Booo"}
{"text":"I've been to this Hooter's several times as well. Being the hopeless optimist, I hope that it's better each time. Each visit...I am let down again. Don't get me wrong, the girls are gorgeous...HOWEVER...Hooter's maybe it's time you start asking your smokin hot girls to do their jobs!  LOL Seriously!  Flirtation is a 5 Star...But, Service is terrible. Maybe the manager of the store should start reading the reviews here. Just sayin."}
{"text":"These girls take there sweet ass time doing there job. No care that I've been sitting here almost 30 mins now and they still don't have a simple order done. Your buisness is wings and you dont have them done???? Every time I come here it's the same way. If I didn't have to come here cause of my job I would never step foot in to this place again. Go to buffalo wild wings another mile away and get faster and better service. If I could there would be no stars but can't leave a review with out hitting a star."}
{"text":"First time at Hooters! Every Australian must experience Hooters when coming to North America right?   I honestly don't know how ppl could harshly review this place. It's pretty much what you'd expect!, not some fancy tapas bar or somewhere you go for fine food. I got the sliders, some wings and a spicy Caesar (we don't have them in Australia). The young waitress was very sweet and my friend and I had a nice chat with her.   I'm glad I tried it. I can tick this one off my bucket list lol. I just need a good workout after that meal!"}
{"text":"This hooters is cool. Its upstairs on Mill Ave. I gotta say that I didn't see one non-attractive hooters girl there. I was very please with the scenery, and the prompt service i received. I can bet this Hooters location does extremely well. Good Works girls and guys!!"}
{"text":"Says midnight closed at 11:12 fuck em.... this shit is not acceptable. People that work late or go out need reliable options."}
{"text":"Attractive atmosphere! haha I am a fan of the wings! Good place to meet up with your buddies and have a great time. Hooters!!!"}
{"text":"They must have done something different bc we were blown away by great attention to service. For that I give it 4 stars. The food, it's bar food, predictable. Service is the best.  I wish I had remembered our server's name it's not a common name but we did ask for the manager on duty to give her recognition. It's refreshing to feel so welcomed right from the start  followed through with positive attention and follow up for the delays we had with our food and drinks. It cannot be perfect every time but the attention to our time here made it a good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food, awesome looking girls, and I hear they are trying to make it a Steelers Fan Club there. I am in, lets get in there Steelers fans"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Yea, they've only been open 2 days, but everyone is on point. Menus are the exact same as regular Hooters and they are not jacking the price up like other restaurants would do being in this prime poolside location. Drink come in a plastic cup because we are next to a pool! They actually stay cooler in a plastic cup over a glass mug.  Highly suggest checking this place out, especially when the open the main restaurant in a few weeks."}
{"text":"I am not one to turn down Hooters and actually enjoy the classiness of their fine establishments. All kidding aside, I really do love Hooters. For their wings.   The only thing I like about this particular one is that it's in the middle of Mill and it's upstairs... I don't know why, but I just like that it's a Hooter's that overlooks the street.  The waitresses here seem to be slow in general, as far as taking orders, getting your drinks, etc. I'm not sure why but the few times I've been here I've received the same slow service. Though, once those delicious wings are served to me I have not a care in the world! Unless it's taking too long to get my beer... then we have a problem."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite Hooters to go to even though it's the closest location to me. I only resort to coming here if I'm doing a take-out order to get my wing fix (breaded/hot or naked/911)!   I don't really know what it is about this particular Hooters but I don't care much for dining in here. Other than that, I guess it'll do!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food with shady looking waitresses. This antiquated concept chain needs to go away. If you want to look at boobs, have some self respect and just go to a strip club. If you want good wings...go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My roomie and I hit up the hooters a lot and we haven't had anything too bad to write about. Usually we walk in and seat ourselves, the server comes and takes our drink orders. I usually order a big beer, I'm a small guy too but I do like a good drink. I think I catch the girls off guard when I order my beers and wings.   Our last visit was excellent! Our server (don't remember her name) was awesome! She was working a whole section alone and yet she managed to take care of everyone in a timely manner. She was just ON it with everyone. We left her a good tip because she deserved it. She wasn't hounding or buzzing like a fly but she had a good eye as to when she should approach or when we needed something :)  All in all, this location is pretty good. I hope I didn't jinx myself with this review :)"}
{"text":"Went in on Wednesday for Wingsday and I do like Hooters and their wings...  This location has a ton of young pretty girls and most of them are very nice Our server was great but a bit slow I'm sure some guys don't mind that but I was hungry and a little impatient We ordered and our food arrived pretty quickly The place was getting packed at this time I ordered a Beer but after going to look for it, she came back and told me they didn't have it OK I ordered a Blue Moon and waited about 15 minutes to get it... We also had to ask for forks and plates Our experience was not bad at all and it's what we pretty much expected Our server was very nice"}
{"text":"Summary: My buddies and I was told there was an hour wait for tables; so we ordered take out instead, 10 to 15 mins later, the hostess started seating people who just walked in front of her.  Pro: Great alternate to Wingstop  Con: The way we got treated when we asked the hostess why are you letting people who just walked up to be seated and when we just asked you 10 to 15 mins ago the wait time was 1 hr long and now can't seat us.  Overall: Events like this should not happen; if it weren't for us being so hungry at 12:30am we'd probably gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were seated with menus and waited about 5 minutes for the waitress. She then came over to inform us that the kitchen is closed. I ask: \" What time does your kitchen close?  She says \"12\".  I say \"Oh, but it is now 11:40\".   Five of us left."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a Saturday night looking for drinks and food. Epicenter was way too crowded and overpriced. Had a wonderful server, Nichelle! She was friendly and funny and on top of things. She recommended a drink that was highly tasty. The Bud in the bottle was nice and cold as well. They also have Lemon Drops for only $4.75. One cocktail at a certain place in Epicenter is $13.00! My husband had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich and the breast (this is Hooter's, after all) was HUGE! Nice selection of wing sauces. Ask for a sample. Dipper fries were crispy and delicious. I had a Shrimp PoBoy that was good with lettuce and tomato on a soft bread. Great service and great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Suppose to be the largest hooters but it didn't feel like that to me. We were there at about 11 am for lunch since we had just checked out for the weekend. It wasnt busy but our service was still slow.  The girls that served us were nice. We had a couple of different servers & I have no idea why.  The food is no different from any other hooters. Just checked it out bc it's suppose to be the largest."}
{"text":"Loved the hot wings. Burgers are the best around. Wifi free was a bonus allowing me to connect with the office."}
{"text":"I went here last night with some coworkers, server was friendly and very efficient! however, i had the all you can eat wings and she took my ranch with my plate. i asked the manager (i assume) for more when my new order of wings were brought over and she quickly stated she would have to charge me for it. she never ended up charging me for it, but she was so quick to walk away before anyone else at the table could ask for anything they might have needed. It's just sort of rude and poor customer service.   overall i had a great time with my friends, but i will not go out of my way to return to this location."}
{"text":"So this is my first time going to hooters. I will never be going back the host was nice she sat us then told me my server would be right with us 20 min later no server and then a man sits down right to our left and with in 2 min the server takes his order we wait thing the host who we are sitting right in front of who has been looking over at us may go and get the server, nope she just let us sit there so we got up and left. Never will I be back again"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience all around. We waited all night for everything! Waited to be greeted by a hostess, once seated, waited to be acknowledged by a waitress. Once we flagged down a waitress, we waited 20 mins before even getting a drink! Food took forever, which wouldn't have been such a big deal, but we were sitting there with no food & no drinks!  Our appetizer was brought out AFTER our meal (once we reminded our waitress about it). We went to watch the Cardinals game there & ended up leaving at halftime because the service was extremely slow! We will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"This Hooters is nothing special. The location is the best thing about it, followed very distantly by the food, and then the servers.   Normally I would NEVER bad mouth the looks of a server, but I reserve the right to with Hooters since they are basically saying in the name \"come here to ogle great looking women\". I'd say about one out of ten servers is good looking, and one server I had here actually had what looked like a bacterial infection. I really feel bad saying this, but I could be saving someone the energy (I wish someone had done the same for me).   The food is slightly better than crap, very bland and overpriced. The prices on beer are absolutely ridiculous.   There are much better places to go on Mill Ave..."}
{"text":"There aren't that many food options in this area, so this is your best choice, I would say..  The service has always been fantastic!! The food is usually good (considering it's Hooters). The charred wings are the best option. My biggest suggestion would be to avoid the grilled chicken sandwiches or anything similar like that.. The texture of the chicken is very questionable.. that's really my only gripe... the food *can* be hit or miss, but it's usually decent."}
{"text":"It's Hooters guys... shouldn't expect too much here.  I will say they are somewhat expensive but recently they had all you can eat wings and another special of boneless wing basket on Wed nights and a few friends and me went there every week for that deal with a couple pitchers... but the beer is even pricey.  I do love their boneless wings and their buffalo chicken sandwiches, pickle and tater salad are a good combo.  I don't go super hot but they have a good range of heat and some honey hots and other good stuff - I say mix it up a bit and try em all out.  The scene is the same though I will say this location has some talent as of late.  You also have the sports know-it-all who got cut his freshman year and never let it go, the affliction wearing douchebag that's never rolled on a mat in his life, and the fat sloppy guy that takes all the pictures with the girls.   Don't get me wrong, there are others in there but just typical those dudes are in there.   The girls are super nice... obviously.  But they're not gonna date you big guy - just sayin  Also, as far as I know they do provide the UFC fights for free so it's an okay backup if you don't have anywhere else to watch it.  I don't eat there a lot but it's not bad when I do :)"}
{"text":"Love the Buffalo Shrimp at Hooters. The staff is always fun and friendly. Yay- Hooters! Good bar food and beer, no complaints here. However don't forget your identification if you want to order drinks, no matter how ole you are ;-)!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and crowd was very light. Placed order of wings, shrimp, fries and 2 soda's. Jasmine was our server. First thing these ladies should take note on, when a gentleman has a lady with him, don't acknowledge the lady last. You wouldn't like that treatment if the shoes were on the other foot. Our food came and wings were extremely hot (his), shrimp (mine) were cold and she had to return to the kitchen for the fries. They were cold too. Never checked on us again. Finally, as the crowd grew, I asked a server to get the attention of our server and to our unknowingly she was our server. Explain the food is cold and would take it to go now. Final comment she makes is she will stay at the kitchen til the food Is ready like she did the last time. No you didn't or my shrimp and fries would have been HOT as the Chicken. Passive Aggressive. Don't try it.   6/24: Thanks for the update and I will let you know in advance the next time we plan a trip there."}
{"text":"Not going back till management changes.... Horrible horrible horrible customer service. From the management not the staff"}
{"text":"Waited 7 minutes and still wasn't acknowledged. No hostess, sat myself. No to-go area either. The girls were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. This place is too new and they don't seem to know what they're doing.   And another thing part of the restaurant opens up to the pool so an oven effect is going on as you come in from the cooled casino into the now hot restaurant."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were ok, not a lot of sauce. Wings came out quick. But you couldn't make a phone order for pick up. They make you wait for them."}
{"text":"Super dirty.  I came here just to pick up some wings for the game and take them home.  I sat on the bench right next to the bar by the register.  There were over 100 fruit flies flying around.  The projector screen was covered in them.  The smell at the bar was awful.   It smelled like a soiled diaper, I'm not close to kidding.  I don't know how the bar tenders worked with that smell.  Outside of that, the food tasted fine.  I guess Hooters does mini wings now.  They also don't cook them."}
{"text":"I can say i don't expect much on the service side from Hooters.  That being said it was average today.  We called in our Dine In order ahead of time to save time on our lunch.  They never got our name on the order so there was some confusion there.  Waitress was training and she was friendly.  Wish the speed was a little more prompt.   Food was consistent as usual.  Fries were fresh which was good.  That's about all."}
{"text":"I came by with my family at the request of an 11 year old boy who was excited to see what Hooters was all about.  When we asked for a table they hostess/server took a glance behind her and said they were all full.  I could see that they were busy but there were several empty tables, they were just dirty.  I asked her if we could sit outside and she pointed us to a table and handed us some menus.  After we cracked open the menu a man (manager maybe) came over to us and told us that our table was needed and we'd have to move.  The server/hostess was still out there and watching the situation.  I asked her where else we could sit and she shrugged her shoulders and said \"I'm sorry, we have no more tables.\"  If this were any other restaurant, I would expect a little more foresight from the restaurants employee like, \"it will be a 15 minute wait to seat you\" or \"just a moment while I clear off a table for you\" but it's Hooters.  Since we were asked to leave our table with no other options presented to us, we left but I was super happy that it turned out to be a win-win!  The 11 year old got an eyeful AND firsthand experience on what happens when you pick the pretty girls with big boobs and little clothes - you end up with nothing more than wasted time."}
{"text":"My wife and I have stopped in this location many times. It is close to the movie theater we go to. We have always stopped in before or directly after seeing a movie. Tonight may have been our last visit. We entered the restaurant and were seated at a table after witnessing 2 servers argue about were we should be seated. Once seated and handed our menus we were then ignored for almost 10 minutes as we watched other people around us getting attention. No one ever came to our table at all. At that point we left. I don't have high expectations but I will not be ignored. Too bad for them. We had come there a lot and usually left a good tip. Well not anymore. We will walk to a different restaurant from now on!"}
{"text":"This is my stop for dinner when I arrive into Vegas. It's Near my house and it's a treat for my niece and nephew. I mean who doesn't love wings. OK there are people who doesn't like wings. But I LOVE wings and esp. Hooters wings.   The service is ehhh ok..sometims they come and check on you and sometimes they don't and when they don't you can't find them. Hate that shhhhh_t..   Food is always good to me that is. I usually get the mild breaded wings but lately their mild is just like freakin FRIED CHICKEN. So now I have to ask for medium. And that isn't even medium. WTF!! Come on hooters put some ummff in that wings.. shooot.  Tots is pretty good with the cheese whiz like and bacon. The Philly naw totally had better elsewhere.. TOTALLY.. curly fries is good.   This location is cool with me since it's close to the house.."}
{"text":"Talk about dog crap service. If you don't like your job then quit. Bartenders at the saloon are clueless and don't do their job. Reason why I'm a local and stick to the GV area. Just here waiting for a friend. Never asked to order food and practically had to throw something at the bartender to order another beer. !  Also. Let me stand around and play with my hair and play around with my phone and see if BAE text me! Surprised this place hasn't closed its doors!"}
{"text":"I'm soooooo done with Hooters.  I use to be able to defend them by standing by their food.  But not lately.  The wait staff is always nice, but ordering food seems to be a laborious process and then the quality of the food just outright sucks.  There is one redeeming point about this particular Hooters location.  It is right on Mill Avenue and the outdoor seating is a great place.  Good fresh air and excellent vantage point to see the party below as well as the Tempe Skyline.  It reminds me of a western version of Bourbon Street.  Any restaurant on Mill Avenue with a 2nd floor balcony will have this perk - and hopefully better food."}
{"text":"This is not the place I saw myself walking into on a Saturday afternoon for lunch however, me and my sister were craving wings and just happened to be walking by Hooters. Why not give it a shot...upon arrival we were yelled at by a bunch of Hoots welcoming us to Hooters. There seems to be no Hostess stand so I assume they don't take reservations? We were told we could seat anywhere which is always nice and seeing as there weren't many people in the restaurant to begin with we sat by the window in one of there wooden booths. It's too bad we didn't look under the booth as my sister kept stepping on perhaps the last diners roast beef sandwich or burger chunk and lettuce that fell under the booth. -1 for not cleaning under your booths. Menus are at the table so again..no hostess or server brings you any menus. They don't have a drink menu either so I assume they don't care very much about their drink sales or specials. We came for wings so wings we ordered! We were hoping to get 20 wings for 20.99 and have half boneless and the other half regular which most restaurants accommodate however our server told us we were unable to do that therefore we had to order our own 10 wings each. We ordered 10 boneless which were good and had a hint of KFC spices? Think very large KFC chicken popcorn. Nonetheless they were delicious. The other 10 we got were naked with a medium sauce on the side. Those weren't that great, we should have got our wings breaded. Their curly fries came a decent amount for 4.95 and were absolutely DELICIOUS! Our food did take awhile to arrive seeing as there was barely anybody in there. Their plates are questionable 1980 plastic wooden round things..which made the experience weird. They did have paper napkin rolls at each table if you needed more napkins and a crap load of wet naps which was appreciated. One thing we did notice was that refills on pop are $1.29 with exceptions - we weren't charged so it may depend on how much food you order?  Our server was emily and she was decent - she came when needed and let us eat. Another server came around to give us refills instead of her. A really odd thing was when we paid the bill she counted the money infront of us on our table and then said thanks!!! followed by a \"oh do you want change?\". That made for a super awkward encounter with a server...  Overall, you get what you get by coming here. Don't think you are coming to an upscale Jackastors because you aren't. The food wasn';t too bad but service was slow and the servers seem to be a little inexperienced with polite customer service. There was also some very questionable people walking in and out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok I'm usually pretty good at giving compliments but this is one restaurant that I didn't even stick around to eat the ambiance was not at my comfort level so I was pretty much there for maybe 5 minutes waiting to be weight on !!! oh no one came to even greet me so after 5 minutes of just sitting there looking pretty dumb and hungry I ended up just walking out of the restaurant and have never been back and refuse to go back horrible service and the ambiance is just horrible don't recommend this place at all save your money and go somewhere else plenty of restaurants down the strip to choose from!!!"}
{"text":"So me and a friend decided to come to hootets and have some lunch.. Just for the crab legs however.. Are server was ((Jessica))  The place was kind of empty when we arrived but that's fine with me since I don't like to much wild action going on anywho..  We went with an order or 2lbs of crab legs and 2 passion fruits teas. The teas were pretty tasty. my friend enjoyed his as is but me being a sweet tooth person I added about 2 packs of sweet and low to do the job..  To finish this review off my crab legs were pretty yummy and maybe I'll come back and have another round!!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS IN TORONTO!  I love Hooter's! (don't judge.) It's a great sports bar atmosphere and those wings will probably kill you, but at least you'll die happy.  More about the wings: They offer breaded or non, mild-med-hot flavours and they butter-baste them! Yummmmmmmmm. It's best not to examine the caloric content.  The Hooter's in Toronto is a great meeting place before going to a concert or game at the 'Dome or ACC. The beers are cold, the wings hot and the scenery ain't bad neither."}
{"text":"I see this place has a bad rap, and I'm not quite sure why. I mean, it's Hooters, or bar food served by eye candy.   Now I've been to a few Hooters over the years, and if you're going for the eye candy, this is probably one of the better ones. The wings, meh, I wasn't expecting them to be great, but they were okay.  I originally sat outside at a table overlooking Mill Avenue, but quickly realized this was not the place to sit if I was expecting speedy service, so I moved to the bar, where that's almost always a guarantee. From that point on, it was a pleasant experience. My server was friendly, but not fake, and the wings, well, you go into a Burger King, don't be expecting In-N-Out quality burgers.   In the end, I left full, and didn't regret eating here."}
{"text":"$3.50 you call its on Thursdays! YES PLEASE!!!!!  Okay... so it's hooters. So the quality of food is hooters quality (aka greasy, not great quality, and can be pretty bland).  But the girls are hotter here because they actually TRY. The service is always great. The managers know what they're doing and it's clear that they work their butts off to make this place an awesome place to hang out and to come back to.  Would love to see more TVs though. I understand that people come to gawk at girls, but I come to gawk at games."}
{"text":"Good view from the upstairs. Came on a Friday night and it was dead. The Service was below average."}
{"text":"Both times I've been to this location I was amazed that waitresses could be soooo horrible and still keep their jobs. #1- Didn't know what draft beer was. #2- Totally screwed up the order, extra sauce wings came out with no sauce, wrong drink. The worst part is that both times they acted like it was our fault."}
{"text":"J'y retournerais pour les cornichons frits, qui sont coupés en fines tranches et panés à la perfection. Les ailes étaient correctes."}
{"text":"Usually we love to come to Hooters for their wings (10 hot and 10 Daytona Beach, breaded, all drummettes with a side of ranch) . This time was no different. The food was tasty, the beer was cold, the monkeys made all the hooters girls come and say hi (Tip for all the men out there...bring an adorable child and the girls will flock to your table) and the manager was awesome (he was making sure all was well in the restaurant and he seemed to genuinely care about how we were doing....very nice touch).   The only drawback was our server. She seemed bothered to even be there. We didn't make any special requests, my monkeys were more quiet than most of the adults and we were trying to be friendly but to no avail. Like I said before...you can't win them all. We will be back because we are suckers for the wings."}
{"text":"Was seated and sat there for 1 hour with no service. Went to the bar to get my own beer after ~ 20 minutes. Would have loved to order food but never had the opportunity. Many other places in the area that would be glad to serve you. Skip this spot."}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations walking into Hooters. The whole concept of Hooters is just odd to me but let's just stick to the food.   I came with three others and we were starving. We were definitely in the wing mood but was bummed by the difficulty of ordering. The wing options were 10, 20, and 50 pieces. Now for four people to share, none of these seemed reasonable. We asked if it would be possible to do a 30 piece but they're pretty set on their quantities. We settled for the 20 piece and opted to order extra appetizers to satisfy our hunger.   The food was surprisingly okay. We went for the wings in the buffalo and lemon pepper flavor. The chicken was crispy and juicy. You can never go wrong with buffalo sauce but the lemon pepper was pretty ordinary. Wingstop lemon pepper is 100x better.   For our other apps we went with their famous tator tots and a steak quesadilla. Average and filling, not much else to say.   The food wasn't too expensive for the amount we got. The four of us were full and satisfied. Service was pleasant.  Am I saying you NEED to come here? Definitely not. But if you somehow find yourself here, you won't hate it."}
{"text":"Online ordering didn't work on mobile. I called and was immediately put on hold. Was told 20-25 minutes and at the time of this writing, it's been 27 minutes and counting.  Bar tender (Mandi?) was nice but busy and walked by us multiple times before helping us, while other employees sat off to the side and talked with each other.  I've had similar experiences with the service here in the past. The food was good, which was a pleasant surprise, but the service was a pain."}
{"text":"I am not usually one to complain about bad service, but this was by far the worst service and the nastiest hotel I have ever stayed in! We had chipped tiles in the bathroom, mold growing in the tub. Our air conditioning unit was beyond dirt and did not work. The service in the restaurant was awful! Took over 1.5 hours from the time we were seated to get our food.  I would NEVER recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bad service, worse food. I would not recommend this place. Do not get fish and chips, over fried on old oil. Totally not satisfied"}
{"text":"Not good service. Waited 8 to 10 minutes for my first drink. Every subsequent drink order was served at the bartender's convenience. Always seemed like they had something better to do. That said, Lilly was nice. Wings may be okay, but if you order anything else, the food will be basic AF."}
{"text":"When I lived in the area, we came here a lot... on Mondays. All-you-can-eat wings for $9.99 can't be beat.   The wings they serve on Mondays are tiny compared to the wings they serve on the other days. Service is dependent on which server you get.   The best deal is their Wing Ding. Take-out only, you get 40 wings, 2 large salads and large order of fries for $22.99."}
{"text":"The take out special with 40 wings, fries, gravy, and slaw for $29 is a heck of a deal. The wings are a bit greasy but that seems to be descriptive of Hooter's wings. Despite that, they ARE very good. Medium=mild. Hot=medium."}
{"text":"I feel like the wings are overpriced for some reason... there's always cheaper versions out there. The sauce was not bad... but around $10 for 10 pieces of ice cube sized (or smaller) pieces of chicken... I don't know.  And the outfits don't do it for me either. They were meh."}
{"text":"Best Hooters on the West side of town! Food was fantastic, cold beers, fried pickles are out of this world! Our waitress was fantastic, not flirting for a tip like most."}
{"text":"I do not normally write reviews like this but I am extremely disappointed with this visit. We spent well over a hundred dollars on food but it was mediocre at best. Our last visit was much better but with a chain you expect consistency and this was not consistent. Our server kept wandering off, our food took forever to come out, the wings were dry and not sauced. The only thing we really enjoyed this visit was the fried pickles."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever experienced. Took over an hour to get wings, 25 minutes to get a single beer. Ciara had a horrible attitude and never brought any of us our change back."}
{"text":"We go to this location about every other month. About a year ago the waitress recommend that I smother the fish sandwich. At first I was a little worried but it was good and that's what I order now. Never had a bad time there, I have read other reviews and I guess I am just lucky."}
{"text":"I cum to this Hooters whenever I'm in Phoenix.  Close to hotels and Starbucks. Last time I went I had a sliver in my index finger from climbing a palm tree and falling. Our server didn't have tweezers but summoned her inner MacGyver and took it out for me using a staple. That itself is worth 3  stars. Food is what you  expect from this chain."}
{"text":"Hooters is one of the best place to grab a quick bite with decent bar food and good scenery. The service isn't terribly good but everyone goes for the girls. I love the hot wings and the pickle chips are a must. Their fried pickles are the best I've had.  Want to grab a beer with the boys and decent bar food with hot chicks to take care of you this is the spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always receive great service when I'm here and the food is just how it should be.  If you're in the mood for a quick bite stop by to the restaurant or bar side."}
{"text":"I can't really give it 5 stars because it's not the best place to eat wings but I will say that they are friendly when I go and the food comes out faster than I expected. I love the fries & I like that I can feel relaxed when I go."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some gal pals. Service was fine, no real complaints about that, even though I wish they would take the lid off the dipping sauces before they serve them. I am however the rare vegetarian that goes to Hooters. My friend was dying for something shrimp. Forget what. I order a grilled cheese with tomato. I am honestly sad for whomever calls themselves a cook and allows that to leave the kitchen. The bread was toasted slightly and then I had 4 tomato slices piled on with 1 single piece of American cheese ripped in half on each side. The cheese was still cold. I sent it back. I guess the manager couldn't be bothered to come by with all 6 people in there. Oh, and the pickles had spoiled as well. My friend spit hers out it was so rancid. Almost funny if I wasn't so hungry."}
{"text":"I've been to this Hooters twice. The first time with my dad and the service was ok. Wanted to buy a shirt for a friend and would NOT get anyone to help.  Second time I ordered to go. They gave my food to some random person sitting at the bar, while I was waiting! After 1/2 hour I asked and they figured it out, with no apology. Service is TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"The other reviewers are right about this place. Terrible service and incompetent waitresses. I am from Miami and use to visit Hooters all the time. This place sucks compared to other locations. If there is another Hooters near you, just go there. Or go to Buffalo Wild Wings across the street. BWW is aways packed while this place is empty, wonder why..?"}
{"text":"Hooters Here for the wings right? Riiiiight, well the place is what you would expect.  We had naked wings with 3 Mile sauce, all drums.  This is my go to order at Hooters, which is spicy, but in a good way.  The beers were cold, which isn't the real reason that we all go to Hooters?  Actually, this one is located right in front of the Sheraton Hotel in the Arizona Center, which was the closest place with sports games and beer. Although it has mostly Phoenix related teams on, couldn't find the Lakers game on.    Service was Meh..."}
{"text":"Ughh If I wanted to go to a whore house I would have! These tramps wouldn't get their boobs out of my face :o. The food was just okay, but the wings imparticular were not hot enough! What is this place for BABIES?! Also, the girl that gave me my change gave me eight dollars more then I gave her in the first place. Now, that I won't complain about."}
{"text":"I can't even give this location one star. Service was terrible.  I sat out on the patio. Not one server spoke ad they walked past my table. I sat there 10 mins . Wamted to see how long before anyone even acknowledge me. Finally someone came to my table and asked if I want a drink. Never said hello or offered her name. She returned with water. I waited several more minutes before a different server approached my table and said \"do you want a menu\". I said  yes.  She returned several minutes  later with a menu.  Several minutes later a waitress approach my table and asked if I want to place an order. Never stated her name.... no small talk....  aaahhhh h yeah, I'd like to see your manager . I tell the manager Jason what happened.....  He basically said\" if they would've sat me from the inside I would've recieved a menu\". I said sooooo, that means several different servers can walk past your patrons without speaking. He said if you come through the front not the patio.  I'm done Bye!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hooters a few times but never to this location. My friend and I went here for simple food on a late Friday night. The service was pretty slow but our waitress was friendly. I tried crab legs for the first time and was satisfied. They didn't have crackers for the shells so it was pretty difficult eating crab without crackers. I particularly enjoyed the teriyaki wings, bone in. Never had a problem with the food but just nothing great.  The one thing I felt weird about was homeless people staring at customers while they ate their food. Our waitress even approached our table after our meal and asked us if we saw anyone take her tip off a table she has just served. She accused the homeless man we saw watching everyone eating of stealing the money. I thought that was low-class and not something that should be mentioed in front of other customers. I also thought management should have asked the homeless people to leave prior to the money being \"stolen\".  Overall, it was so-so."}
{"text":"Typically, I try to keep in mind big events and be a bit sympathetic with my reviews. However, while I understand that it is Super Bowl Sunday, and it's probably one of the busiest days of the year, I'm extremely unhappy with my order today.   We ordered through Uber Eats, so I'm not too concerned with the fact that it was cold, because that will partially be on the driver.   What I DO have a problem with, is paying nearly $10 on extra sauce and dipping sauces and not getting any of it.  I also have a problem with the fact that my celery was not only sloppily cut and broken, but covered in dirt.   Our order was nearly $100 total, you'd think they would try to get an order right for people dropping that kind of money on their food."}
{"text":"The great thing about my visit was the VERY cold beer.  The food was alright.  If I am going to splurge on wings, I have better options around here."}
{"text":"Waitstaff suck... Unless you have testicles. I love Hooters wings, I won't be back to this Hooters."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came out tonight just wanting to have a good night and watch the basketball game. We got sat by the hostess promptly at a corner booth and waited for our waitress to greet us. But after fifteen minutes no one had showed up to our table. Even though a group got seated next to us and immediately was being waited on. My boyfriend had to get up and tell the hostess that we had still not be waited on. After a couple of minutes a waitress showed up to our table and greeted us and asked us for our order and drinks. She came back with our drinks soon after but told me if I had any issues with my Piña Colada to let her know and she would get it fixed because the bartender had made it so quickly. The drink was fine, not a problem but the night just snowballed from there and got worse. Another forty minutes had passed we still had not received our food and just when I was about to ask about it our waitress Kyleeah came over and said, \"I'm going to be honest with you guys but your food is just now being cooked because the cooks were playing around in the back instead of cooking the food.\" This should have been the moment where we should have just gotten up and left but no we just stuck it out and kept waiting. When our food did come out, it was mediocre and half my chicken sandwich just looked questionable and was cold so I ate bits and pieces of one half and left the rest. Our pretzel bites tasted off and had a burnt taste to them so I set those aside as well after a couple bites. My boyfriend was fine with his wings and side of curly fries so he finished his meal. Then our waitress came back and just really talked out our frustrations for the night and was honest about what happened and was behind our concerns 100% and said we could speak to her manager and see what we could do about our experience and the bill. We got the manager of the night to come over and we explained our concerns about the night from start to finish and his response baffled and just pissed us off to be honest. He said that we just ended up being 'that' table of the night that has a late waitress, the drinks and food takes a while and just gets poor service and is the unlucky table. His response as a whole made me think that 1. This happens often at Hooters 2. We got the short end of the stick and it just happens in this industry 3. He had no empathy to our situation  He gave us a free appetizer voucher for the next time we come in at either this location or any other. With no real genuine sorry just a bandaid to a larger problem. Again, our waitress sat down with us to talk about what we had gone over and we were honest and said we didn't appreciate his half concerned apology. So she mentioned that her higher up above her manager was in and that we could speak to him if we had anything else to say. So we spoke to the GM Chris and he sat down with us and really went over with us what we had put up with and he didn't even agree with the first managers approach or words. He apologized over and over and ended up taking off most off our drinks and half our food order off our bill. We didn't care about the bill or what was taken off, we just wanted a genuine apology. We just wanted to come out and have a good night before a long work week. We both know what it's like to work in a restaurant but the job of a manager is to resurrect a bad night and turn it around and we just didn't feel like we got that tonight until Kyleeah and Chris stepped up and stood up for us and our experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar to eat and the bartender was pretty attentive so the service was good. Inside the restaurant looked a bit dated as it was a bit dark. I ordered 10 naked wings (half Three Mile Island and half  Triple Dog) which were cooked thoroughly but not nearly crispy enough. Next time I will order them extra crispy. They said the Triple Dog sauce is really hot but it wasn't for me. Then again I eat spicy food often."}
{"text":"I've recently visited hooters and every time I go here I have a great experience. The girls are all so sweet and they have the best wings. Britney was such a sweetheart and always made sure we were doing good. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So, me and some friends went to Hooters for wings and beer. Our server, Angela, was wonderful. She greeted us with a smile and had our beverages to us within 5 minutes. After our food came out, she actually tore off napkins from the roll and gave it to us.  I have been to Hooters several times and this was the best service ever. Oh the wings were good too."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some wings last night and didn't want to drive too far from home, so the hubby and I stopped by Hooters. We went there once when they first opened and didn't go again because it was a bad experience all around. We figured to give them another try because we figured they would have fixed all the kinks by now... and they did :)  We sat ourselves and didn't have to wait long until the waitress showed up and took our drink order. She was smiley and very pretty that even I crushed on her a little bit!   We ordered the fried pickles to start and 20 piece chicken wings. Everything came out in good time. The fried pickles are definitely addicting! The wings were cooked and flavored just as I like 'em.  All in all, it was a pleasant experience. I would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat wed. It was packed so service was kind of slow. Our waiter was very charming and nice though. Food was alright. Not the best wings but you kinda pay for what you get. Personally, I like making my own wings but the process and clean up takes too long. Definitely would go here if I ever crave wings. I thought the Chipotle Honey a lot. It sweet and spicy compared to the Daytonya Beach which was more sour and spicy. Their Lemon Pepper was okay but I did not their Parmesan Garlic. It didnt look good and it also didnt taste that great. I also ordered a American Mule which was pretty good. Overall, pretty good for the price.  Price: $$ Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch and met my bro. The greeter was nice and our waitress Missy  was great as well. Lots of great eye candy for the guys :-) TV's everywhere you look which was way cool. They could use a pool table, I thought the food was excellent, a little slow to get but overall I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great environment, showed up on a Sunday to watch the Cowboys play. Multiple T.V.'s to cover different games. Fried pickles are amazing & the location is very convenient."}
{"text":"Servers standing around, chewing gum, and playing with their hair. I get the hair down thing for the image but I don't understand why every where else they have to wear their hair up except here. Not sure why health department turns a blind eye but didn't see a single one of them wash their hands."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. 1hr to get the food and it's the wrong order...  The shrimp tacos were not good The Baja tacos were almost raw The chicken sliders were ok  The beef sliders had zero flavor The wings were decent  I hope they get their act together or they won't last."}
{"text":"OMG, I went for dinner last night. My granddaughter like the kids chicken strips and my son is a wing guy, I tried the Taco Salad, I figured that should be pretty Safe. Boy, was I wrong !!   Don't ever order that at Hooters. Nothing about it was fresh and the only thing good were the pieces of chicken, I didn't even resemble a Taco Salad. Plus I've been up all night sick.  I'm crossing this place of my local places for fun food.  I remember when the wings were the attraction , but no more. This place needs an update in Decor and the menu.  It sucks"}
{"text":"I used to like coming here to this Hooters like 2+ years ago, but since then this place has gone down hill.  And last night was the situation to tip the scale making me decide to probably not ever go back.  I was charged for 2 extra drinks which I did not order.  Me and a acquaintance were out on the patio enjoying some drinks and winning our night out when a some guy came had a conversation with us about California and where he grew up.  Then all of a sudden a waitress comes out asked us if we wanted another round which I said no as we were going to be living their shortly.  The guy from California says yeah give them another round and put it on my tab so I look at the waitress and I still told her no we are good.  Then the guy goes back in and 20 minutes later the waitress comes out saying I was told to bring these out.  So at the moment I told her I already closed out my tab and she said I don't know and left the drinks.  So I figure at that moment that the guy decided to have them put the 2 drinks on his tab.  So we drank them thinking the drinks were taken care of and before we finished the drinks another waitress comes out with a check for me.  Now I don't know what kind of scam they are trying to push but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to stop in there again.  I should call the manager to report the incident which I might do"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch while my car was being serviced at the Volkswagen dealer across the street. It was 11:30am, prime lunchtime, and it took forever to get our food. There was only 3 other tables in the entire place and it took over 30 minutes for our 2 sandwiches to make it to our table. The waitress never checked on us or apologized. Once the food came it was underwhelming to say the least. The curly fries were the best thing on my plate. The chicken was dry and the bun was way to large for the chicken that was on it. Next time I get my car serviced I'll visit the Chick-Fil-A instead."}
{"text":"2 stars for the staff..   5 stars for the young woman who was seating customers! (stunning!).  ZERO, sorry ONE star for the food (there is no zero)..  Awful breaded wings, sooooo bad."}
{"text":"I am a longtime hooters fan, but this was the 1st. 1st and only time I've ever let a hooters place hungry. I've enclosed pictures. These were by far the smallest portions I've ever received in years. I'm dead serious 10 boneless wings (2 sauces) and 10 shrimp (Cajun) and these pictures are all I got. It feels like they cut the wings in half and then served them to me. These were appetizer portions for a full meal price? I'm extremely disappointed. So much so I asked the manager about it. All I'm getting is a shrug and a \"blame our distributor\" reason for why the portions are so small. I'm seriously feeling like I've been cheated. For the record he offered me another order but I felt so ripped off I didn't take him up on it. I wish I had. This was really disappointing. My server was great, the beers were cold but I've never encountered such a small order masquerading as a full meal before. This wasn't okay. I think someone is cheating someone somewhere in regards to this."}
{"text":"Everyone (every place) deserves a second chance. Although after having a poor experience twice...there won't be a third!   The Hooters girls were very nice although a bit forgetful, on both occasions. Also, they seem a bit confused as to who's table is who's. Then there's an awkward moment when they're both standing at the table ready to take our order. This happened both times I was there, kinda uncomfortable.  Also, I understand their shtick is to have pretty girls waiting on you, but when their hair is long and flowing everywhere, especially when they're playing with it while working, it's not very sanitary. They should maybe have pony tails or have it pinned back somehow no?   The food. The wings are just ok...in my opinion they're not a as fresh as other Hooters restaurants. Also, the fries were stale, like they had been sitting there for days and the cook nuked them in the micro for a minute before serving! Also, I order 10 wings and when they arrived the waitress stated that she owes me 3 because 3 fell on the ground. I never saw those wings...not surprised. I understand the wait staff is young but I think a bit more training would go a long way. No more Hooters in Scottsdale for me!"}
{"text":"Great patio, decent beer, loud and rowdy patios. Lots of women in tight orange shorts and sheer stockings. I didn't see any owls."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Hooters with my best friend one day after work, with me not really knowing what to expect of the place. We came in on a weekday night so it wasn't as crowded as I imagined it to be and it was open seating.   Vanessa soon came by to greet us and took our drink orders. Menus were already on the table so we had a look and quickly decided what we wanted. She was very friendly! I have had females tell me that they get rude service when they're at Hooters, but that was absolutely not the case for me.   I ordered a quesadilla and when it came out, we were both surprised that it was absolutely huge! But it was so delicious with lots of cheese and a crispy tortilla. Sour cream, salsa, and guacamole were provided on the side.   I also ordered their signature wings in a medium. Originally, I wanted to order mild but was talked out of it by Vanessa because she said that mild wouldn't have a kick that I'd like. She was right, medium was delicious! I had a Shirley Temple and it was quick to be refilled as soon as it was 3/4 of a ways down.   My best friend got boneless wings and fries and it was delicious for her as well.   Overall, I had a good experience and will come back with a bigger group next time to make it more fun!"}
{"text":"!!racist!!!!on 1-26-18 at 4:11pm. the server brittany was rude and horrible. i didn't even want to order anything because her first impression was not worth my money. she had an attitude as soon as she got to the table. myself and two friends left. i will never come to this location again. !!! also she told us that its illegal to have happy hour in north carolina!!"}
{"text":"Slow and not particularly friendly service.  Finally got seated, and they carded everyone, including people over 50.  One didn't have an ID and was told no beer.  For someone obviously 50, and with complete agreement that there was no question about age, \"but it's just policy.\"  We left."}
{"text":"We go to this Hooters for Midnight Snacks and I've never been disappointed. Eat at the bar if Paul is workin'. Great guy and keeps you well watered. The tots are awesome and the fried dill pickles are very tasty.  They do the wings Daytona style if you ask, That's where they flat grill them when they come out of the fryer for a moment.  Gives then a extra crunch."}
{"text":"How does someone give a chain a low rating because of food?  Dude/Dudette, it's the same menu around the world.  Now if service sucked, well, okay then, but all in all it is what it is.  I liked the place, and compared to other Hooters, not too damn shabby.  Enjoy it for what it is... A place w cheap beer, shots, and wings. Oh, and who gives a bad rating for a place with Hooters everywhere?"}
{"text":"Waitress staff was not great at all and un-welcoming. Once we got our food it was cold. Wings were good but could tell they were premade and not hot but just lukewarm. Disappointment :( I love hooters and wanted to take my boyfriend for his first time and he wondering why I liked the place."}
{"text":"What can I say, Hooters is Hooters. No one comes here because it's classy. The simple wooden paneling that adorns their restaurants cries easy going, the taps make it evident that they are a bar, and the waitresses' uniforms are intended for the wandering eye to catch, with bright orange and white being the primary colors. You've been to one, you can count on a similar situation at another.  Service: I went in around 9:00 pm on a Saturday night. It was my pre-game. I came for the wings. A friendly hostess asked me if I wanted a table or a booth. As the bar was open, I took a seat there (When flying solo, I usually choose the bar, no use in taking a whole table for one person).  Within five minutes of sitting I was greeted by a cheery bartender who took my order, and then informed me the other bartender would be taking care of me as she was leaving. Pleasant enough. Except that the other bartender didn't acknowledge me for about 10 minutes. I was hungry, and had set the menu down, and she walked by me three times. I tried to catch her attention a couple times and then finally flagged her down.  There was a regular there, who definitely got great service, but for us mere mortals who show up on occasion, not so much.   Food: The wings are tasty. Standard fare as far as what one would expect for wings, never poorly done. After I was able to place my order, the wings showed up fairly quickly. I also enjoy their buffalo chicken sandwich, and the hamburgers are good as well. Food is not the issue at any Hooters I've ever been to. It's your commercialized super standard fare. If you have tried one, you have tried them all. If it's off, there are greater issues at the restaurant.   Overall: Why the 3 stars? The food is always good, but I have shown up to this location on a few occasions and each time the service is from poor to okay. The girls always have a smile for you, but the attentiveness is questionable. I think for that reason alone, I find myself coming here maybe once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"FYI!!! You cannot vape here! Even at the bar! (Thanks a lot, stoners!) But you can still smoke at the bar. Otherwise, it's fine, it's fine. I do wish the bartendress would have explained the vaping thing instead of waving her arms around like my vapes were purposeful toxic pollution before the guy who sat next to me started smoking his actually toxic cigarette (however, thanks, guy for the bumming me the cigarette!!) but whatever, whatever. Otherwise, it's exactly what you want Hooters to be. (Besides that UFC stuff... This wasn't a UFC time, so I didn't care. Sounds awful though)"}
{"text":"Wow, what an awful experience I endured this evening! Tonight, just like every other Friday night, I met with my teammates at your location in Mesa before our softball game for Happy Hour. We all ordered our food and drinks from that menu uneventfully. Our orders took longer than usual to come out, but I attributed that to it being Friday. When the check was eventually presented to us, my girlfriend noticed that everything on the bill was being charged at full price, not the prices from the Happy Hour menu that we ordered from. When we brought this to Shannon (our waitress)'s attention, she talked to her manager and then said that she needed to take back 2 of my girlfriend's sliders (half of her food), because \"the happy hour sliders come with 2, and 4 come with the standard menu\", so we could only have 2. To actually TAKE FOOD BACK FROM A PAYING CUSTOMER'S PLATE took an incredible lack of judgement. Of course, we asked to speak with a manager, and when Sherri (who claimed to be a manager) came over to our table, she incredulously repeated the same line about the different menus, etc...saying that they were following their \"policy\"  when taking the food back. No one at your establishment demonstrated the smallest bit of customer service or basic tactfulness when dealing with us. Eventually, the manager came back with the 2 infamous sliders in a box, saying that we could take them with us. Obviously, at this point, it is not about the food. It was never about the food! Our experience was embarrassing, humiliating, and infuriating. I will tell everyone I know about the poor customer service my group received, and I am sure, as you can tell by now, my group will never be back to your restaurant. We will take all of our business elsewhere. You can thank Shannon for not understanding how to take an order and Sherri's lack of basic customer service for that."}
{"text":"The chicken is so good. I always get the breaded wings. It has the perfect balance of crunchy and saucy. I can eat it without any ranch or other sauces. The bartender (or person in charge?), Steve, is super nice. The restaurant has awesome ventilation because it flows to the patio so you won't smell like oily chicken or smoke if you're hanging out at the bar late at night. Expect to pay around $10 for 10 wings."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I never complain due to the fact that I've managed restaurants before so I understand being short staffed or even having an unexpected \"rush\" of customers all at once. My family and I (husband and 2 kids) were seated very promptly which was to be expected because the restaurant was not full and plenty of tables were available. After waiting it took about 10 mins for the waitress to stop at our table to take our drink order. After getting our drinks it took her another 15-20 mins for her to come and take our food order. The next part had to be the most painful. We literally waited 45 mins for our food to come to our table and once it did we received 1 kids meal which the fries were extremely cold and inedible. We also received part of my husbands meal at that time. 15 more minuets go by and the rest of our meal arrives. During this dreadful time a manager did not stop at our table to see how we were doing nor did our waitress explain what was going on or even offer an apology. I've never experienced something like this. This was extremely frustrating and my kids were upset due to the fact that they had to wait an extremely long time to eat. I just wanted bring this to someone's attention. I'm not sure if this is how this establishment runs every Saturday evening !"}
{"text":"I live here most of the time but lately this store has gone down hill they have driven the wait staff to seek employment elsewhere they have very little promotions to keep the locals coming back like they did with the old regime now it's more sell hats sell shirts sell these stupid little deserts that actually taste like crap"}
{"text":"Place has terrible service and terrible girls. Its the employees that can make or break a place. This place is garbage so are the girls."}
{"text":"Went here to eat because all our local ones are out of business. Prices were similar to a regular location and not inflated like most on the strip.   Service was good, and got our order fast. However the wings tasted like they had been under a heat lamp. They pulled them out and squirted a little hot sauce on them. And I mean a little. They were very dry and largely tasteless. Same with the fries. Like on a slow night at McD's you can tell when they've been laying in the tray for like an hour.   Maybe if you're real hungry, try it out. But for me; last time."}
{"text":"I have eaten at hooters numerous times and normally its pretty good.  I have to agree with the previous reviews that the food tasted microwaved or something.  Almost like it was old or from the previous day.  That wasn't even the worst part though.  The service was terrible.  Our waitress was working her butt off the whole time but again just like the casino it is insanely understaffed.  Why on earth would you have one waitress trying to handle over 5 tables at a time?  She could not keep up.  The manager of this casino/restaurant may be achieving his budgetary numbers as far as labor is concerned.  However, the amount of return customers you are losing will offset the price of one more waitress.  We wont be back.  I wonder if the manager of this place actually takes time out of his/her day to even read these and follow up with us?  Yes?  No?"}
{"text":"Went Sat afternoon to watch ND/UM game.  Took a booth in the restaurant and watched servers walk by our table for 10 min without acknowledging our presence.  Was getting ready to leave and my wife really wanted wings and a beer, so we went to the bar.  Took another couple minutes to get the bartender's attention but she apologized and took our order.    Food was a bit slow, but ok.  Price was average.    I know this is a franchise, but mgmt needs to get figure out the service and be more consistent.  We don't come very often because of the service."}
{"text":"Dumpster fire. If you're looking for the quick synopsis, there ya go.   I almost feel bad reviewing this Hooters with all of the other dismal reviews (all of which I can very easily imagine to be 100% correct), because I feel like I am piling on to bully a disabled kid. It really is THAT bad, so bear with me here.   Hooters has been a (quickly ending) Christmas Day tradition for my family and friends for years. Hooters is one of the few places open late for Christmas and by Christmas night, everyone has cabin fever, are tired of leftovers, and just want to get out of the house for beer, wings and football. Due to my family's location in the Lincoln County / Lake Norman area, we have been alternating between the Gastonia and Mooresville locations for years. Gastonia is now out of the equation due to the outright awful food and service.   We arrived and stood in the \"lobby\" area trying to determine if we needed to wait to be seated. If you're familiar with this location, you know that there isn't much of a lobby area and you basically walk in and are standing very close to other diners at their tables. Sometimes you seat yourself at Hooters. Other times, during busier days (they were moderately busy but not slammed when we arrived), you have to wait to be seated. There wasn't a sign but I figured we probably had to wait to be seated, so we stood there like a couple of dumb asses for 4-5 minutes thinking a hostess would at some point fast rope from the ceiling like a Navy SEAL and seat us. Didn't happen. We came to the conclusion that maybe this was a seat yourself day, and sat ourselves at one of the only available tables in the restaurant (note: there were MANY empty tables, but they were all dirty and had not been cleared).   We sat there for a little over 20 minutes without being greeted. Instead, we received constant dirty looks from the servers that were working our section. I told my buddy that maybe we were supposed to wait to be seated after all [shrug]. This was later confirmed when a couple came in, were immediately greeted and sat by a hostess (WTF? Where did she come from? Maybe she was a Navy SEAL after all!), and quickly received their drinks. We still had not even been greeted.  We saw that a server in another section had noticed us and was talking to the servers in our section, pointing towards us. She was trying to get help for us. They shrugged it off. This server (from the other section) eventually came up to us, told us the servers in our section were busy at the moment (She was being kind. She was busier than they were. Hustling), and said she would go ahead and take our drink order for them. I asked if we had done something wrong to deserve the dirty looks and intentional neglect. She confirmed that yes, we were supposed to have been seated by a hostess. I told her we would gladly get up and wait to be re-seated - that we didn't know. She told us that wasn't necessary.  She put our order in and brought our drinks about 5 minutes later. When it came to ordering food, we still had not been helped by anyone but our stand-in server. I flagged her down and asked if she could just be our server for the rest of the night. She said yes, and from that point the service was excellent. The food, however, was lacking. The wings were cold and took about 45 minutes to come out. Ah well, par for the course. Service continued to be dismal for others around the restaurant. I counted 8 tables at one point that were empty but had not been cleaned. Three of them were in our section, where the servers were \"too busy\" to help us. Meanwhile, a manager (I think?) was walking around giving out discount cards for our inconvenience that had to be used at a later date (LOL, WUT?! Won't be one), and servers were sitting at tables while nothing else was happening.   A few weeks have passed between our visit and this review (Aka, the \"cooling off\" period), but I think we paid around $66 for the experience you just read about. I don't want to take anything away from the server that really stepped up and went well out of her way to help us when no one else would. I left her a $100 tip. See what happens when you put good customer service above your petty attitude? Good things.  Note to management: The proper way to deal with customers that unintentionally seat themselves when you have a hostess is to politely inform them that they need to wait to be seated. This may be hard to believe, but we will happily comply. Other restaurants have figured out that signs are awesome for this purpose, but from everything else I saw during this visit, that may be too next level for this Hooters. What I do know is that dirty looks and intentional neglect are typically not great customer service approaches. Anyone at Hooters corporate that just cannot figure out for the life of you why this and other locations are getting absolutely destroyed right now, refer to this review and the many others just like it."}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and I've had a tradition for 15 years that I eat Hooters wings. Imagine my excitement when I found one on Foodora - my business trip was saved.   No... It.is.awful.  The chicken is clearly the awful pieces they didn't want to sell people in the restaurant, they're over cooked, and inedible. I tried I really did ... :(  And the salad. 7.99 for this. How?! JUST HOW?! How do I even eat it in a container like this without spilling everywhere, no plates, and how is there not more???  So much disappointment to have my birthday tradition broken over this :("}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday and couldn't believe how dead it was. My waitress Karen was very sweet and attentive. The wings were good as they normally are. They are currently running a special buy a meal get a kids meal free which was a plus. Recommend to anyone who loves wings."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Have not been here in a long time but now I think I just figured out why. This place is supposedly known for their wings but not only were they small and dry. Our French fries we're cold. The waitress Estrella came by every  Haley's comet. Forgot to bring us our ranches but sure didn't forget to charge us for them. Looked for the manager who was sitting at the largest table like El Hefe when we arrived but when we actually needed him to do his job he was no where to be found. Last time we come here for sure."}
{"text":"Hooters, the \"family restaurant\"!  If you're expecting your taste buds to be blown away in some kind of culinary awakening you might leave somewhat disappointed.   On the other hand, if you want cold beer, bar food, all kinds of sports on multiple TV's and waitresses dressed in classic Hooters attire you'll get just that!  I mean it is what it is, a Hooters is a Hooters no matter where it is. Okay food, okay prices, free WiFi and fried pickles!    We also had the good fortune of being served by an exceptionally nice and service minded Minnesota waitress who made this particular Hooters seem a little classier."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. We were surprised to find out we were charged about $3 for the ranch and blue cheese that came with our wings. Well vodka and tonic was almost $6. Beer was even more. Coke was $3. Service was ok. Fries and wings were so so. I wouldn't go back. Ended up being $50 for a coke, a beer, one well drink, two orders of wings and an order of fries. Pricey for a mediocre lunch for two."}
{"text":"Went to hooters for the first time last night and I had an amazing time. The food was very tasty. Everything was good. The service was a bit slow as it was really busy so I guess that's acceptable. Will definitely go again the future."}
{"text":"The two star is ONLY because I love hooters food...seriously the b*tchiest waitress I have ever encountered. The place was empty and she didn't even seem like she wanted a table! Will not be back to this location...ever."}
{"text":"Wound up at Hooters on a Monday night, it wasn't the place we were originally headed for but that's where we stopped. It was about 8:30pm and the place was semi empty, more waitresses than people but everyone was friendly.  My date and I were seated pretty quickly, we had pick of the place, our server was Lexxi, who was great at making sure we had what we needed at all times.  I ordered the Western BBQ Burger, it had bacon, cheddar cheese, onion rings and bbq sauce on it, this was a huge beefy burger and it was cooked perfectly. The curly fries are fun, though they are not my favorite pick of fries. I also had a crazy sweet tooth and ordered the chocolate mousse cake, it was perfectly sweet! Layers of cake & chocolate mousse where the perfect blend and cured my sweet tooth for sure!   I did order a Hurricane and have to say to me it seemed to be missing something, like the booze part haha, but it tasted good.  Over all food was good, had a good time down at Hooters."}
{"text":"I went to this Hooters location last night to watch UFC 119 with friends. The first minute I walked through the door I was informed impolitely that there would be a 10$ charge to watch this fights, which was to be expected. At that point I was slightly annoyed due to being treated like an object of only monetary value. Afterwards I had a seat in the bar area with friends. I sat for 30 minutes without being asked if I needed anything. Eventually another friend showed up and sat down. At that point a waitress finally came over, took his drink order, and then practically tried to run away from the table. I literally had to call her out and ask for water and to place my meal order. This waitress did not make eye contact nor was she even slightly friendly. Mind you, it was only 5pm and the restaurant was maybe only 25-30% full with an obvious ample staff of employees. I then ordered wings, which arrived warm, not hot; at this point I was seriously annoyed; they had done everything wrong at this since I stepped through the door. From there on out we were hardly attended to by an impatient waitress who had less enthusiasm than a nun. Also, nobody came to pick up any of our used plates on the table. The place is obviously managed by an apathetic slacker because their employees were some of the worst I've ever encountered. Will I be back? What do you guys think :)"}
{"text":"Service was great! But I can't say the about food. Sliders had a wierd taste. Boneless wings had no flavor at all! Medium wings werent spicy at all! Unfortunately we will not return to eat here. Maybe to go have a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it's an Owl sanctuary! Wrong turns out it's a restaurant with waitresses who wear tight clothing !! I was hungry so I stayed, what the heck never had Owl before. So to my dismay they don't sell Owl wings and so settled for chicken wings. I recommend the Daytona Wings naked and well grilled. The sauce taste like these girls think they look. Delicious. I'm kidding the girls here are a strong Scottsdale 7 but I still don't understand why they call it Hooters. Good place, a lot of TVs and food is what you would expect if Applebee's ever tried to hire attractive employees, which clearly they don't, that's another review."}
{"text":"Once again! I helped host a club meeting here! 40+ people. Had friends in Vegas for SEMA . Some were from as far a Sweden! Place was great!  Great job once again on such a big group! Thanks for always being so good! We come here once every other week!  So it must be good! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Went to Hooters to get something to eat. We were seated quickly. A waitress arrived and the order was taken. I only had the grilled cheese sandwich. It came with a pickle and Curley fries. It was cooked the right way and the price was about average."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to a couple locations, and by far, this has the worst wings, I don't think I'll be coming back...I've realized that hooters isn't consistent with their sauces, I guess every location makes their own sauces, I always order hot, sometimes naked, sometimes breaded...regardless i always get hot. This hot sauce had no flavor, it's so bland that I thought they didn't sauce my wings and I ordered extra for dipping...it was just no good. The chicken itself tasted weird...and I'm a wing lover so I know what chicken wing meat taste like when it's old, it tasted old and dirty like it hadn't been rinsed before frying...it was pretty bad. Service is cool though...the best location in the Vegas area is in sunset station in Henderson, it worth the drive...plus they have 20 wings and a pitcher for 20 bucks!!!"}
{"text":"The bar staff here really needs some customer service training.  I come here for Happy Hour and on Friday nights. I enjoy the wings. I have to agree with Alex N. I think I also get super powers of invisibility! The bartender Sarah has a badge that says something about being 'certified' or something or other. I guess you can be certified in something and still suck at it! Sarah has the personality of a tree stump. I honestly have never seen her smile.  I came on a Friday night and Sarah spent most the night talking to 2 of her girlfriends at the end of the bar. She ignored the other patrons. Even the guy sitting next to me commented on it. There were 3 girls behind the bar and both of us sat with empty glasses.  It all starts with management. If they don't watch the girls and give helpful criticism, then it never gets better. If they hire poorly...then they get poor quality help.  I will keep coming only for the wings. I just won't tip well until they figure out how to smile and be nice. Tipping is my silent comment on their poor service.  I hope they are listening!!"}
{"text":"Best wings! The difference is they cook their sauces into the wings instead of just dumping a bunch of sauce on top of it like a lot of wing places do!  I make sure I stop here every time I am in Vegas which is a lot! My mouth is watering just thinking about them!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I have every had at hooters!!! The worst I tell you. Do not go here. We will be writing a letter to corporate about how shitty the experience was and how shitty the manager was. We waited 45mins to get WATER. We had to ask another waitress because ours was MIA for the longest if we could get some drinks. We asked for the manager to tell him about our experience and he looked lost in the face and apologized. Ok cool, so we see that people that got seated after us not only got their drinks way before us but also their food. And another couple who came in right when we did ate and left while we are still waiting. It is now over an hour and we still do not have food. Our waitress came over and we told her that we still haven't gotten our food. We had to tell her we didn't have our food! We tell her we want to see the manager again. He comes over and asks us if the ticket in his hand is our ticket and says he can give us $20 off. Meanwhile we STILL do not have our food. Really Brian (manager), really?! All you can do if take off $20 off of 4 meals with drinks at this already overpriced hooters?!? When we complained he gets defensive and says \"don't yell at me, it's not my fault!\" Who's fault is it Brian?? You are the manager! The worst!"}
{"text":"Buffalo shrimp never tasted so good. Beer was cold. Service was spot on. Hooters girls were lovely and friendly. Manager Chris is a very nice and personable guy. Would recommend."}
{"text":"VERY Disappointing. I like breaded wings , and not too many places offer them. A few friends and myself decided to stop into this Hooters. I was a regular customer of the Hooter's in Station Square a few years ago. And although expensive , I enjoyed the service and the food enough to keep going back.  This place is a train wreck ! Very Dirty , unorganized , expensive and GREASY. These wings has little to NO flavor. A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link , well this is the bent paperclip in the Hooters chain ."}
{"text":"Service was good but the wings I got was nothing but breading.  Was a plate full of wings but it was all deep fried artery clogging breading.  And the beers were 4.68  a bottle and it wasn't imported it was Budweiser..   I like to taste the chicken when I get wings though and next time I'll just get an ice tea."}
{"text":"This particular Hooters is a decent place for lunch. You could also go the strip club next door as well. Up to you.  Hooters doesn't have a lunch menu really but the main menu works just fine. This location is huge and unfortunately, that makes it appear as though its empty most of the time. In case you don't know, Hooters offers up classic fare like burgers, sandwiches, and wings.   The chicken tender sandwich is pretty good as they have it served on buttered up Texas Toast, while the tenders tossed in hot sauce are covered with sauce and cheese as well. Their curly fries are always so good. The wings here are OK. They've been better in the past, but their Daytona Style is good as they finish that off on the grill.   The servers are pretty but they're always scrambling around for no reason? Regardless, it's a decent place for lunch and if you're craving wings."}
{"text":"Worst service, servers and bar tenders are picky among customers for reasons I can' t tell. Will never ever come to this place"}
{"text":"The waitress was insanely terrible, and when we asked her why she had such a bad attitude, she said that we didn't tip her enough on our last visit... But she must have confused us for someone else. Haven't been back since, and never will go."}
{"text":"My husband and I were sat right away,  our waitress helped us right.  Place wasn't busy at all....now here's why I gave them a 1 star and they're lucky I even gave them that!  We ordered 2 beers and appetizers.  Mind you,  our table were by the bar area.  Our waitress was missing for a minute and beers were sitting at the bar and the bartender went missing too!  It was to the point that I forgot what we ordered and who was our waitress since we only saw her once.  We decided to leave and no I won't be going back there again.   Hooters service went down big time,  surprisedthey are still open."}
{"text":"I was staying near by at a hotel for work and decided to grab some wings and fries to go from here, not very impressed. Although I don't really ever expect greatness from their chicken wings. I ordered hot but there wasn't \"hot\" flavor at all. I think their saving grace was that they were breaded. The fries weren't great either.  The location was nice, had nice outdoor seating and the servers were friendly. The food was ready to be picked up in 8 minutes from when I called so it was quick service.  I'd probably go back again if I was stuck nearby and this was my only wing option, if that's what I was craving. But it definitely wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Hooters all around downtown phoenix are horrible and on 75th Ave! Bad service needs to have  restructuring with staff to improve customer service."}
{"text":"I didn't see one attractive hooters girl here with \"hooters\" just sayin..."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely TERRIBLE here! Waited 15 min to be seated cuz the girls were at the bar area hanging out, they took half an hr to bring my drink and another hour for food. Never coming back to this place, if u want wings there's a Buffalo Wild Wings down the street 10x better."}
{"text":"I came here to watch some football.  The wings are what I remember...decent, had better had worse.  We got great service from Carolina, she always made sure that our drinks were filled and checked up on us many times during the game.  Finally a server with beauty and brains!"}
{"text":"We went yesterday, and it was the second time that we went, we will not be back to this location.   The Palms location sucks, even though they own all the locations in Vegas other than the ones at the Hooters casino.   We ordered the Daytona and some normal wings. Both orders of wings were COLD. The sauce wasn't done right it was like there was no care in any of it.   The service was actually good from the waitress, but the food was awful. The manager was kinda like oh what ever."}
{"text":"Waited outside for 10 min..no service. Went inside and waited another 10 minutes before someone took our order. Waited another 15 min only for the girl to come back and asked what our order was AGAIN. After giving her our order again she went back to her corner. We sat right by the bar and she didn't even go to the bar to put in our order for beer. Worst Hooters ever. First and last time going to this ghetto place. Management sucks too"}
{"text":"Our dinner today was not the best , the waitress forgot that we were sat in her station , we waited awhile and finally she realized we were there . Order ice tea there's no ice and forgot to put the flavors , food was fast and it was good so 2 stars go to food"}
{"text":"We were walking by and noticed a young man that was passed out by the Hooters parking lot. He was lying face down and motionless.  As soon as we saw this, we informed the staff there. They responded with a snarky reply of \"that's just Toronto for you\". And closed their door on us.  Complete disregard for human life.  We were shocked and waited for two officers to come by on bikes, who checked on him for vital signs.  I'm disgusted by their staffs behaviour. I was a customer at Hooters for their food deals, but never again."}
{"text":"Horrible service here. They brought me the wrong drink and when I told them I didn't want it, the waitress stated that the manager was going to make me pay for it..... wtf! And not only that my card was swiped three times. Twice I was charged $1. Then the third charge a total of $22. I caught them in the act and they tried to play it off like it was the \"tax\" that I didn't get charged for the first time. From my understanding, whenever you pay a tab the tax is always included in the total. I know it's only $2 but that is theft. Watch you or bank accounts when you come here. Or you know what. Just stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"When I was a teenager this place was always a bit of a novelty. As a teenage boy it was a fantasy hang out when you finally turned 19. I had never been to one before, so when my friends suggested we swing by for a laugh I was totally down.  It's depressing and uncomfortable. The whole atmosphere feels like the 80s (in a bad way) and the gimmick is sexist. I mean, it always has been, but in 2016 I feel like this place needs to pack it in.  Once you take away the marketing angle you're left with a pretty crummy sports bar. And we had some of the worst service in recent memory. I felt bad for the woman because it seemed like she was relatively new, but the food and drinks were also lousy, so not much was going to save the evening. We played if safe with the nachos, but they had ice-cold cheese on them. Like the cheese came straight from the fridge and they forgot to turn on the oven.  Simply not a good choice given the better options in the area. Decent food and service is what you at least expect at any downtown sports bar, but this one didn't manage either. I hate to review something negatively on one visit, but this place was highway robbery.  One good thing: they have a rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Chicken wings are less than average. Too much batter and sauce. Hamburger was decent and onion rings Is good. Service was very good. The server was very friendly.  Nothing spectacular.  Just another mediocre sports bar."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! First I tried to call in a to go order for just 10pc chicken. They put me on hold for over 15min! So I figured they were busy on a Sunday night. I ended up just driving there and order my carry out when I get to hooters. When I got there, the restaurant was empty! The waiters were just standing around talking and one was playing a crossword puzzle. I ordered my 10pc and waited for 30min! Never again will I go to this hooters ever again! Lazy people are working here!"}
{"text":"If u've been here, u may very well kno the setup is terrible. Even jus finding this place (located behind Hardee's)is difficult. It's as if Hooters took over a previous establishment not big in business. The bar only seats 10 with a large square room. There r only 2 Hooters signs on the building itself. If this place wants to make better business, I suggest they move to a location more visual from Route 45. On the other hand, I noticed a fellow yelper complain about the texture of the food but it was fairly consistent for my experience. Also, this location employees pretty young ladies, after all it is a college town. Ur welcome! ;) Only 3* for mediocre-ism"}
{"text":"Brandon C, who brings a 9 year old to Hooters? Maybe you can sneak him into a strip club.  Hey this is Hooters. What are you expecting? I love this location and the Bevan Special hot dogs. Not on the menu but named after a local entertainment production hero.  Most of the gals I met are in college and are hard workers. I would say my only criticism has to do with the large salads. I ordered the Cobb. No Bacon. Are you kidding me? OK, I have to pay extra. Then I get the salad with two little cups of dressing. Not enough for the entire salad but I had to pay for extra dressing.  Lastly, no happy hour unless there is a pro football game on."}
{"text":"\"Oh, no! You didn't!\" \"Uh, yes. I did!\" How can you not go to a place that bills itself as \"delightfully tacky yet unrefined\"?  Now, I know there are quite a few of you who have judged this place before going.   It's not as bad as you think. In fact, it takes serious balls (or boobs if you prefer) to walk around with the ugliest pair of tights to go under those orange shorts.      I have no issue with the women and their hooters.  It's really the men leering that is kind of gross more than anything. They should just go to a real titty club but the wing special on MOndays is hard to beat.  You want to know something? At least these women are covered up and wear the proper bra with their uniform.  I see, consistently, especially in the summer,  more women out in public - streets, stores, restaurants, whatever in more inappropriate wear. In fact, memories of them have scarred me so much, I fear summer.  Now, as far as food goes. Stick with the chicken wings and you will be fine. Straying from their regular menu, you will be faced with somewhat mediocre fair.  For the amount you would be spending, consider going elsewhere for a meal. However, I would definitely return for the wings special - All you can eat wings on MOnday for 9.99!!"}
{"text":"I came to this Hooters yesterday for lunch hoping to get some good wings and have a good time. I ordered some wings and my girlfriend ordered some shrimp with a side of fries. The server took our order so we waited for like about 30 min. It was a long wait time but I thought to my self they probably busy, but I saw the restaurant and it wasn't full at all. So after the thirty min the server comes back and tells us what did you guys order again. I was like WHAT. She had responded that they lost our ticket. I was so irritated but I was like we already here so might as well wait. We told her what we ordered and then left. The manager showed up like 3 min later and apologize and said the would pay for the shrimp but it would take another 30 min. So we waited an hour for our food and the worst part was that the wings had barley any sauce and the shrimp were so under cook and it didn't even look like half a pound. I love Hooters but after yesterday it just knocked a few points down. I would recommend to magement to look at the food before going out and making sure it well dome, also to keep track of your ticket orders."}
{"text":"Paid 28.00 for 20 wings and when we got home the wings had no sauce and they were sitting in a pile of grease in the carton. Waste of money. Who would ok sending food out like that? Yuck"}
{"text":"Blows any other hooters away. Prompt, attentive and clean. It was peak lunch time and everything was still great!"}
{"text":"I love the new hooters! Way better than the place the old place on Bell! The place on Bell had a problem with your beer lines, and in the summer the beer was always warm. Not here, the beer is always ice cold! Of course the crispy wings are my favorite with a medium sauce and some nice cold ranch. Service here has always been good and fast , as well as the ambiance."}
{"text":"My husband always said that Hooters had the best wings.  He was feeling some wings one night, so we ventured to Hooters.  And no, he did not want to go to Hooters because of the scantilly clad boob-showing servers. His wife's boobs are sooo much better!  He ordered the wings and was not thrilled.  I'm pretty sure that he loved the wings so much because he used to eat them after all the beer he drank dulled his senses.  With only one beer under his belt before eating the wings, they were quite lackluster.  The service was terrible as well.  We waited entirely too long for wings and a burger.  The server was too busy fake-flirting with 2 guys that would never stand a chance with her.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and thats not being busy ..wont be coming to this one anytime soon ... also food is cold under cooked....bad bad bad smh"}
{"text":"Manager tried to convince me that the buffalo shrimp is supposed to come out cold..yeah what about my fries and chicken sandwich are they supposed to be cold also.  An absolutely a stay away from place."}
{"text":"Stopped to pick up wings to go, BIG MISTAKE!!! should have gone to the downtown or Metro location. I went to the bar since it was just a take out order... no bartenders for 7 minutes (timed it) light crowd, and the wait staff was more interested in standing nearby talking about getting hours,  boyfriends staying in Orlando, last nights hook up...meanwhile almost an hour later rather than check on my order, she asks someone else to check on it! She's to busy chatting about that boyfriend with what may have been a mgmt type for the restaurant. the wings come out with what I was told \"extra sauce on the side\" !/2 the order is correct, the other half isn't breaded (as asked for) and they have NO sauce at all. IT WILL BE ZERO degrees in Phoenix before I step foot in that dive again!!! Piss poor service and unable to fill an order properly."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be the world's largest Hooters.  It was kind of strange for me to be eating here because just 2 days earlier we were using the space for a hackathon.  Hooters waitresses always are nice and this was no exception.  I read some poor Yelp reviews for this location, but I was seated right away and not only was my server very friendly, but others would smile also.  They have good appetizers, but since it was just me I had the mushroom burger and substituted with onion rings.  The burger was really good, cooked just right with a good mix of cheese and onion.  The onion rings were OK, but next time I will probably order the fries.  Service was fast and she refilled my Coke Zero without asking."}
{"text":"Great location, clean and drinks are within 10 min.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD!!! It takes an hour to get a simple burger or chicken wings.  Waste of time in vegas. Unless you want drinks from tight dressed chicks, then avoid at all terms."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come to this Hooters a few times...living so close and being in the industry, loving the outside patio and being a gambler, this was a no brainer. Until tonight.  Upon walking in to a half full bar, and one table on the patio, no one greeted us hello...no one even acknowledged the fact that we were there. I proceeded to the bathroom while my husband got a table on the patio. When I arrived, no one had greeted him yet, so I sat down with him to wait.  After waiting 20 minutes, while watching the waitress on her phone and walk past us twice, my husband said to me \" another 5 minutes being ignored and we are leaving\". Oddly with in the first minute, I saw the waitress FINALLY head our way.....  Only to be passed up , to check on the already finished and waiting table behind us. Surely, she has to see the ONLY OTHER table on the patio and greet us, right? NO.  SHE WALKED RIGHT PASSED US FOR THE THIRD TIME. No acknowledgement that we even existed.  For being a \"local\" spot, they surely act as if they could care less about anyone... Little did they know, I'm a GM of a local bar myself, who tips quite generously, who gambles ALOT, and has quite the gift of gab. Sad to say, but this place has lost our business, and if they continue to allow their staff to treat people this way, I cant imagine they will be open for much longer.  Save your self the time and irritation and go down the street to The Sparkling."}
{"text":"Average food at best. Wings undercooked and greasy. Onion rings underwhelming. Service poor. Waited 30 minutes when place wasn't busy...  Won't be back..."}
{"text":"Their is a reason why this location is closing down mid-may and not just because stations casinos took over either which is the food & service are horrible. The big screen TVs are the only good thing going for the restaurant. Be very careful when your on your cell phones in this restaurant not lift them up too your eye level when reading messages or for whatever reason or you will be asked to stop filming the girls. This location and management is notorious for falsely accusing guests of doing that."}
{"text":"Great spot to just hangout by the palms pool, the drinks are cold and the wings are as good. Service is good, when I went the place wasn't that busy but I'm sure it gets pretty wild in the restaurant. Prices are very reasonable for being on the strip, suggest you go to this hooters before any other one"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 2 months straight on Wednesdays for all you can eat wings with a group of 6 people.   After last night we have all decided to give up on Hooters. Every single time we get wings they are undercooked and rubbery. Some of them are still pink. We started asking for them well done and nothing changed.   The wings last night were not edible. It was gross. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Our server, Katie, was cheerful, helpful and on top of her service.  Salads we're great.  Didn't care for extra charge of dressing as husband ordered Italian and blue cheese"}
{"text":"I love hooters for the fresh chickens.  The wings aren't bad, either!  I order mine bone-in, naked, and hot. The wings, that is.   If the waitresses didn't have to wear those creepy nylons as part of the uniform, and had bare legs instead, I'd give Hooters 5 stars."}
{"text":"Our food was good and service was ok. BUT both of my children were served old milk. They are daily milk drinkers and NEVER get sick from milk. We ordered them chocolate milk as a treat. I didn't realize it was old until I got home with their kids cup smelled funky. I took a sip and SPOILED MILK! That was 5 hours ago and both my kids have been vomiting all night and morning, diarrhea and fever.  Their poor tummys have been turning all night."}
{"text":"Jenna doesn't look like her picture that she handed us. She also wanted nothing to do with our table since the beginning of the night because we were out enjoying the night. Macy was getting trained and she was enjoying the entire conversation that we had. We asked her to view a text conversation and she laughed to the convo which was on bumble. Then she went to the assistant manger or what he thought he was and he came up to like a glam girl with his chest puffed out over something that he would do on a regular basis, quite the conundrum. Since then, we have been indirectly kicked out of hooters. Never the less, the best service with me had was the curb we had to go over to get into the parking lot."}
{"text":"All the waitresses were sitting at tables with customers.  Finally saw us after we turned to leave.   Only two of us.  Man and woman.   That means you get less attention.  The floors were super sticky.  Gross.  We had more than 4 different people come to our table.   Simple order of wings.   Messed up order.   We asked for sauce on the side.   It's not sauce.   It's like cold flavored butter paste.   It was gross.   No wonder hooters are closing down everywhere"}
{"text":"Firstly, I don't get here often.  Because it's a chain.  Because I'm not in university any more.  And because being served by a clutch of wait staff that are skimpily dressed and in another life could easily be daughters of mine doesn't particularly turn me on, it's not a big draw for me.  It was a surprise when Toronto opened the doors and let Hooters take root in Toronto's downtown club scene on John.  In fact, this was the first and pretty much only Hooters I've had the pleasure of going to.  Restaurant-wise it's fine.  There's nothing to complain about and when buddies of mine want to go there, I'm okay with it.  The wings are decent and the beer is, well, beer.  On Monday nights, during Monday Night Football I would guess, you can have all-you-can-eat wings for $10.  I'm guessing if I showed up with a garden bag for take-out, the deal would be off and I'd be jettisoned.  Turfed from a Hooters.  Mom would be proud."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats (#OBC93). Big order to feed whole family. Ordered the burger cooked medium rare, arrived RAW - as in mushy and uncooked, cold in center. I sent pics to Uber and demanded a refund, their robo response was useless. When I protested more a human responded and basically told me to review Hooters but nothing can/will be done about it. I'm just as angry at Uber - in Hooters defense Uber didn't even give them the ability to make it right. Still, the food came from their kitchen, so the review goes to them too."}
{"text":"Well pretty disappointed with the bloody Mary's here! Was looking forward to a nice hangover cure but it wasn't happening."}
{"text":"Stayed Labor Day weekend and the AC vent had so much dust my allergies are still bad my throat itches too bad I checked the vent the last night.  Didn't want to come back from vacation with an ugly itchy cough. The mozzarella sticks were amazing though !"}
{"text":"We had Rachel wait on us \" the bartender\". She knew when we needed a refill on beer and she had excellent attitude. Service was on point and wings were great!"}
{"text":"Was very surprised to walk in on a Saturday night to find it not very crowded & this was after a big event at Salt River Fields.  We had a table of 7 people and our service was extremely slow.  My wings were good as usual, however the onion rings were cold (like they were sitting out waiting for the wings to be done).  Another person in our party had to have their boneless wings returned because they came out cold also. The manager did come out to replace the boneless wings & apologize for the problem.  But our service there just fell flat.  We all wished we had decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings which is right across the street.  I will probably give this Hooters another chance in the future, but if the service is the same it will definitely be the last time I go."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch to sit in the patio. The hostess was polite and asked if we wanted to sit outside. When our server approached she was hostile and very unfriendly. We ordered three items that all came out ten minutes apart. The last item coming out 35 minutes after it was ordered. Her explanation for this was \" someone dropped the sandwich.\" The food was semi cold and nothing special. We watched the manager and server sit up front and talk our entire experience without ever asking us how our meal was. Absolutely awful service and we will never go back."}
{"text":"I went for the unlimited wing night.  It should be called \"unlimited time\" as it was SLOWWWWW..they must discourage re orders by taking a long time but I believe it was our Waitress(Nikki) Horrible service!! All the wings were hot and crispy ONCE we got them !! We even waited for the check to be delivered and then to be picked up..  our meal took an extra 30-45 minutes and the place was 30% full."}
{"text":"Came here doing the lunch rush hour of Downtown Phoenix, and was expecting a flurry of people for lunch. It was actually relatively quiet and the service was quick and helpful. The waitress was attentive and took pretty good care of us.  In regards to food, let's just say it is typical bar food. I ordered the Grilled Fish Tacos and of course they were bland. But honestly, who comes to Hooters expecting good food? The waitresses, cold beer and fast service were good enough for me!"}
{"text":"The wings were good! Preferred the naked wings! The waitress were great! We had about 14 guys, they did a great job serving us!"}
{"text":"OMG HAVE YOU MET SAM ?? I would drag my balls across 10 miles of broken glass, just to hear her fart in a walkie talkie !!!! Sam is outstanding, I will only go back because of her, even though the foods ok the experience was fantastic thanks to her! Her energetic and positive energy made my experience great!"}
{"text":"This hooters location has the absolute worst customer service. You have your cooks and hooters girls all in the back flirting with each other when they have people they need to be serving. I ordered a while before I came in to pay and yet the order is still not complete. How is that possible there is no one in here! I am very disappointed with the level of service provided by this location and the lack of knowledge the hooters girls have of their own menu. I will not be returning to this location! Yeah I am one person but I've stopped crowds before. Places like this don't deserve business."}
{"text":"Wings are good, oysters are really good. The one thing I have always disliked about Hooters in the uncomfortable chairs and stools, I hate them."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some buddies the other day for some lunch. I remembered this Hooters opening recently and being named the largest Hooters in the world, although maybe it was just me but it didn't seem \"that\" big. The overall design/decor is somewhat bland and placed awkwardly inside of the Palms. I did see the Palms Pool right along the bar though so props for that! Our hostess took forever to acknowledge us but our waitress Sandy was amazing. Beers were cold and the food was good. I'll probably be back. Happy hootin!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Ordered the Fish n'Chips. Fish was warm at best and tasted like cat fish. We ordered wings as an appetizer and received them with our meal. Wings were good. My wife ordered a quesadilla and she was happy with her meal. My dad had a alcoholic drink and was asked to finish it before coming into the restaurant.   The 24/7 cafe next to the Hooters has much better food quality."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Typical Hooters fare.  Decent wings and decent service.  We all had to wait for refills a little too frequently to rate this establishment any higher.  Our waitress was very cordial however."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, felt comfortable to hang out. Our waitress Angelica was such a sweetheart towards my lady and me, she made sure everything was going well. The food was delicious and full filling. 10/10 recommend :)"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night and it wasn't busy at all. We chose to sit outside and there were misters all around. The mist was nice but the table got pretty wet.  I would imagine it would be better during the day when its really hot.   Our server was friendly. I ordered some naked wings and naked shrimp which hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Not really a Hooters fan lol.  However, this place slightly had better quality in their food compared to other locations with their chain network in the US. The food was decent for the price (hence the 3 stars, not 2) and the place looks the same as any other. It has a big location on a corner in a nice area of town but the parking is nearly impossible unless you pay at a lot at a garage or underground center. The waitress named Vee was nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Came in here for a beer and the Bears game. Now, keep in mind I'm 21 and haven't yet gotten the horizontal driver's license, yet. Not ONE other store in \"Champaign County\" has refused to serve me because my ID is vertical. They tried saying it must be horizontal. When trying to tell the waitress that I was not trying to be rude or fight, she became hostile. The managers finally gave me my drink because my FOID card is horizontal. Funny thing is, I was sitting right next to the sign that said they need VALID ID....if I'm 21 and the ID isn't expired, it's valid. No if's and's, or but's. Guess this won't be my hangout spot."}
{"text":"Not the best Hooters I've ever been to, not the worst.  A colleague of mine is a Hooters afficionado, so he insisted we go for lunch recently while in town.  I will say the waitress lived up to the name of the place, for once.  I made a mistake and went off the reservation and ordered a burger.  It was VERY mediocre.  Should've stuck with the wings.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Breakfast included option is problematic. Apparently there is no healthy option as standard, not even a poached egg. Fried or scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, bacon or sausage. That's your lot! Had to escalate all the way up to senior management (after being brushed off twice by 2 other members of staff) to be allowed fruit instead. Come on guys you want us alive to come back don't you?"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Hooters about once a month for the past 2 years, and it seems like every time I come here the experience gets worse and worse and worse. It's clear that the customer satisfaction is declining because recently I've often see the manager walking around checking on the customers. If the manager has to patrol the restaurant to make sure everyone is happy, then clearly the employees aren't doing their jobs right.  The staff of friendly, reliable waitresses as Hooters has declined considerably. When I first started going here, the waitresses were fun, friendly, and fast. Now when the waitresses serve you, you can here in their tone and see in their body language that they don't want to be here. None of them seem enthusiastic about their jobs and their attitude projects onto the customers. The only waitress that's almost always happy is the bartender. But sitting at the bar gets boring, and can get annoying when some creepy middle-aged guy is sitting next to you. If you're a good waitress I will tip you at least 20%. But the past few times I've been here I remember tipping the waitress about 10%, which is what I give for C-rated service.  The food, including it's taste and preparation, has also drastically declined. Two years ago the chicken wings would be a home run. Now they're a double, at best. This Hooters doesn't serve their mild sauce anymore. Why is beyond me. My taste is very sensitive to spicy food. Even something with a little bit of spice will detract from the taste of the food. So without their mild sauce, their least spiciest sauce is their Medium sauce, which has a little kick of spice in it. So now I can't even fully enjoy my wings.  And about 50% of the time, my food comes out luke warm, or even cold, like it's been sitting for 10 minutes waiting to be served. Which is probably what happened since the waitresses hate their jobs.  Also, this Hooters doesn't give military discounts anymore. Really, how difficult is it to give a 10% discount for service members?  It really sucks that this restaurant has declined so much over the years. I used to love going here. Now, I try to give myself reasons NOT to go here. I don't know if because the management changed or if they just have a staff of really crappy employees or if they're using cheaper ways to prepare their food. Maybe all three. But this used to be one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix and is now one of the worst.  If you find yourself in the Arizona Center, try a different restaurant because you'll more than likely have a better experience there than at this place."}
{"text":"I have numerous friends who have worked for this chain. Amazing customer service. It's what makes it different from every other place. I don't expect 5 star food but I at least expect 4 star service. I have attempted this location a total of three times now. First time was decent, I give you that. The last two times were offensive. The Daytona wings I ordered at 12pm showed up at 12:50. I could understand if the kitchen was backed up but there were only 3 people there. The server completely forgot about our food so when it arrived the fries were cold and the wings were incredibly soggy. The response I was given was \"well that is how they always are.\" Really? At least apologize for the mistake. Nothing was even taken off our bill even though I sent them back! The last time I dined here (hoping they just had a (bad day) was even WORSE service. The girl behind the bar was wearing a black shirt and jeans because she said she was a supervisor. I was there with one of my girlfriends and we were completely ignored. Our food order took 30mins to get in because she was busy chatting with the girls starting their shifts. Once our food was eaten and we were ready for our bill, we asked politely and got it instantly. Unfortunately, it took another 15mins for her to run the card! Complete and utter disrespect. Hooters guidelines state to always serve women and children first. This supervisor was more interested in the latest gossip than a good experience. Hope you guys can weed out the bad at this location. Until then, I'll stick to Buffalo Wild Wings or Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, we went to this Hooters. Once we sat down, we didn't have a waitress approach us for 10 minutes (we sat in the patio area)!!!! Terrible. BUT, once she DID come over, she was the sweetest waitress I've ever had at a Hooters (we are regulars back in Chicago).  BTW, the stool seats in the patio area are incredibly comfy!   My daughter ordered wings and I ordered the chkn strip grilled cheese (back home we have the grilled cheese platter). The food was delicious... my daughter's wings were the best she's ever had. I ordered the 4Peaks Hopulent and actually had to walk to the bar myself after 10 minutes to grab it, apparently the waitress forgot (NOT GOOD), considering the other two guests at my table received their drinks. By this time, my savory craft was a little flat tasting. BUT, besides those two downers, we really enjoyed this Hooters. Would come back! :)"}
{"text":"Have to change my review because my service the last 20 times has been great!!!! First couple of times service was extremely poor. Not anymore, service and food is always good and I can't stop coming!!! Definitely one of my go to spots. Love their wings, cheap beer, and their happy hour specials are great!"}
{"text":"This Hooters was alright. Yes, I thought the wings were delicious like every other Hooters. But I had the lotsa-tots here and they were not that great. It wasn't even hot. It tasted like they were old and just have been sitting there. The upside to this place is that they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"Service at hooters restaurant was amazing. The bartenders Bianca and matrisha (don't know if I spelt that right) are always amazing to us. . We love hooters"}
{"text":"11-12-2016. 6p to 730p. we stop by to enjoy nice dinner and couple of cocktails before the Suns games.  there were 4 in our party.   we had poor customer service ---  after we were sitted placed our order. 2 salads, wings and drinks.  food No issues.   Customer Service when we wanted extra drinks - the young ladies,  we tryed  to get their attention,  they even look at us never came by to see what we wanted.    Even they serve the tables  next us ,  still no service.  finally we asked for Manger he came by asked , We express our concern.  still took around over 5 minutes for him.   He was apologizing about service how busy they were. Which we were happy to see it.  However, we were getting upset that,  No one  wait staff ladies , at least 4 of them never came to our table, even made eye contact and wave my hands, to get them to come by.   Do hope they get trained better in customer service.   M. Vasquez Phoenix AZ"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hooters in the US. The ladies are pleasant. The wings are delicious and they don't judge me when I've eaten 25 on all you can eat weds. The place is always clean and I don't have to hold my breath when entering the restroom to wash my hands."}
{"text":"Creepy manager here....has a lazy eye and is constantly grabbing and slapping the girls asses when they passed by. He insulted my husband for wearing a Chargers jersey....which I know happens in man land..but he is a manager and thought it was outta line.  I usually dont complain about the food here because it rarely is special, but my son was served a boneless wing that was frozen, and they were supposed to have a bbq sauce on them and they were just fried. When called the manager over he swore that the wings had sauce on them...it was more than obvious they were sauceless. As for the frozen chicken...he did not even address it. He did not offer new chicken..he just came with the bill...and deducted the wings. He never said another word to us."}
{"text":"I stopped by with some friends on a Wednesday evening, 7/22/2015. We sat out on the patio area. Fortunately the weather that evening was wonderful. Jamie, our server, was great. She paid attention to us and was fun to have around. Very nice and energetic too.  The downside of our visit was when they ran out of the fresh brewed iced tea, so they didn't have any for refills. The manager Chris came over and explained the issue to us, apologized for the oversight, and promised that more was being made as we spoke. We were asked if there was anything else we wanted while waiting for the fresh tea. Problem arose, problem solved. How problems are handled provides true measure. Chris was very nice and helpful. Glad the he was the manager to take care of everything.  The food was good, drinks were good. We had a great visit.  They are still in their \"soft\" opening. Additional area plus an upstairs area are still under construction. I was told it would be about another month before the official opening."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW EVER! I have never received such bad service to the point where I had to literally take the time out of my day to tell the rest of he world about my bad experience. Customer service no matter the type of industry should always be NUMBER ONE. Me and my girlfriend dine at different restaurants at least 3 times a week. (She's 7 months pregnant) and we just really like being fat together.... anyways With that, I would like to call out a waitress named \"Jess\".  She simply DID NOT DO HER JOB. We sat there for at least an hour, not once did I get a refill on my drink, I'm still parched as we speak. But wait there's more... she explained to us that we could not share our all you can eat wings which was perfectly fine, understand Money has never been an issue,if that was the case we wouldn't be dining in the first place... my 7 month pregnant girlfriend did indeed end up eating one of my wings but that was AFTER the young lady decided to take 10 minutes to bring her some extra dressing to go along with her Cesar salad. NO EXAGGERATION, Keep in mind she's pregnant,moody,and hungry which by the way is one of the worse possible combinations ever. Then has the audacity to call her out on It saying her managers will yell at her which I get BUT had you done your job in the first place this certainly would not be the case. Don't get me wrong the wings were FIRE. But will I go back? Definitely not, again customer service is EVERYTHING. Side note, tonight was the first night I did not tip a waitress since HIGH SCHOOL. I have never walked out with my head down after eating such a delicious meal. & although the food was great I still felt robbed, my girlfriend is going to be in a bad mood all night & to be honest I HIGHLY doubt I'll be getting any type of loving tonight :( soooo thanks a lot hooters...."}
{"text":"I went to Hooters after a meeting with some friends. This was my first time and my last time. I got the spring garden salad  with chicken. The chicken was awful on the salad. Something in the salad was offputting. A friend suggested I try a wing. The parmesean chicken wings were not fried hard as requested. I put my salad in the trash. I always heard the food was good so my surprise when it didn't pass muster."}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE experience. I spent over $70 here on a takeout order, not only were the traditional wings overcooked but I asked for the wings with extra sauce and recieved them with NO sauce AT ALL. I lived with that and picked off the burnt skin eating only the dry meat inside. Well, that was last night and this afternoon I am still feeling sick from their food. I'm in the military here for an event and truly upset that I will be feeling this bad over the course of my work day and even more so knowing that my fellow service members will be settling for the mediocrity of this restaurant simply because of our hotel location and lack of transportation."}
{"text":"Chicken was served RAW and COLD, even though it took over an HOUR for me to get it.  Silverware was dirty with chunks of old food on them. Manager is unapologetic and seriously lacks leadership skills. Wish I could five ZERO stars!!! Guess the people don't normally come here for the food!"}
{"text":"Nice rooms,  customer service sucks.  Computers and phones were down,  refused a 1pm check in early as a result, yet checking out was as scheduled.   Front desk continued with insult by pointing out, \"if you were able to check in early, we would charge you anyway\".  Was told no check-ins till 4pm, showed up at 3:20pm and 60 guests in line checking in.  Also no early bag check, was told that was available yet they were all sitting in office doing nothing, no management keeping employees on their game, joke."}
{"text":"Went here for Thursday night football.  Got seated quick. Tables are small, had to push tables together for big party.  No biggie. Nice place. Lots of tvs around. Big screens above the bar. Ordered wings for the tables. Not bad. Nothing special. Server was nice. Didn't seem like she had experience in the food industry before. Got some orders wrong but fixed it. Hooters still rather hire hot chicks than competent workers but she tried. Only thing that sucked was wait time for whatever you ordered. 20 minutes minimum for anything. Ordered pitcher of michelob ultra and we went to the restroom and had a cigarette, came back still didn't bring it out. Food takes a lot longer. Overall it was an okay experience. Nice place. Alright food. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Should've checked the yelp and google reviews before coming here. Wings were ok and the service was way below average, not cool when you have to ask for refills, ranch and even a pen to sign off for my check. Not going to come back, they need better servers, rather than one shoving the wrong plate in front of you and walking away without saying a word. But hey, Monkey Pants in Tempe have some of the best wings!"}
{"text":"I have gone back to try the food out again!! This time the wings!! Totally tasteless! The girls are skinney with fake boobs which is not even pleasant to look at! The beer is good but wayyyyyy overpriced, never again!!!"}
{"text":"What happened to Hooters?  Always loved Hooters, today not so much. Quality of food isn't what it used to be. That makes me sad. Got the buffalo chicken sandwich it was ok. Just ok. We were the only people in the place and our fries were cold and dry.  While the bartender seemed nice enough, she spent most of her time texting and talking to another customer that walked in. We will have to get our wing fix some place else."}
{"text":"The hotel:  I have stayed at many bad casino hotels in Las Vegas but this one is the worst. The bathrooms are outdated and dirty, which I hate.  They put us in a strip view room but water from the toilet (I know, yuck) or bathtub was leaking into the carpet 2 hours after we checked in so we were moved to a pool view room. I needed a crib and they brought a broken one first, so I had to call them for another one. The bathtub water was coming back into the tub, the flow was very low so  I just didn't take a shower because I was grossed out. But I have to say once you call them with a problem they are very quick, someone will come within minutes and fix it. That was impressive. Also the carpet was clean- I always wash the carpet with a rug because I have little kids.  Saturday night it was pretty loud at the pool when we went to sleep, but most people don't come to Vegas to go to bed at 10pm so that didn't bother me too much. Parking is free here which is nice. It's also very easy to get from the parking garage to the lobby and to your room. I also liked that it was close to the strip for us to walk to.  There is complimentary water bottles in the room - which is a plus.  The restaurant: great food at a great price. Service was lacking but the restaurant was packed.  I will probably not stay here again, but you never know...for $29/night sometimes you have to lol :)"}
{"text":"So we haven't been to a hooters in probably 5+ years.    Apparently you are some sort of zoo animal if you aren't familiar with the inner workings of their menu.    We ordered wings and nachos.  The girl asked us if we wanted the wings breaded or not....ummmm, I don't remember there being choices.  I just remember thinking hooters had pretty decent wings.  Now what?!? We asked the server her opinion...she said, \"I thought you said you had been here before.\"  Then, she recommended the naked/unbreaded variety.  We decided to wise up and try both.  We ordered them medium and she warned us that their medium was very mild, so we ordered them hot.    Oh my! That was difficult.    Well, we concluded that the breaded version is far superior to the naked version and the \"hot\" is indeed not spicy so I'm sure the medium is ultra mild.  Whoa! Did you follow all that? Should wings be this complicated?  Their wings are almost covered in a buttery sauce....very different than other buffalo wings.  They were A-OK but not one of my top picks for wings.  The nachos were MEH.    This location is nice because they have a big indoor/outdoor patio.  We ended up spending around $30 for 2 sodas, wings and nachos.  A bit steep."}
{"text":"I went to this Hooters on my first Vegas trip... the cabby had no idea where the hell it was located and neither did we, I got in the cab and said take me to Hooters!  (obviously this was before the Casino opened by the strip)  About four of us girls came out here for lunch which was great and it wasn't anywhere near busy in there...   I got a seriously cute hoodie that says welcome to fabulous hooters as a pun on the vegas sign... and it has dice on the sleeve... (I have a dice fettish)... I had a great time and they were having a clothes sale.. who could ask for more??"}
{"text":"I came here to hear a band I had been wanting to see. The music was great, but I can't overlook the beyond terrible service.  Our first round of beer was served in 16 oz plastic cups. For some reason, after this our waitress brought our next round in 12 oz plastic cups. We were ready to have a good time that night and so we requested our drinks be brought in the larger pint size. She shrugged and said she couldn't do that, the smaller plastic cups were all she had. I was okay with that, until I saw her bring the table next to us some beers in 16 oz pint glasses (not plastic!). We then requested the same glass as they had, but she then told us her manager wouldn't let her use glass because they had to wash them - it's a restaurant and bar, OF COURSE there will be dishes to wash!   After this, we ordered several more rounds, all brought in 12 oz plastic cups while I watched her bring 16 oz glasses to several tables around us. I honestly have no idea why this occurred, but it made me pretty annoyed.   The food was okay - very fried and greasy but exactly what I would expect from a Hooters.  When the bill came, we were charged a full pint on every 12 oz drink we had (I know, because it clearly said \"PINT - STELLA\" and whatnot on each line of the receipt). We brought this up to the waitress, who acknowledged they weren't pints, shrugged, and said she couldn't do anything about it and we had to pay full price for each drink. This was one of the only times in my life I have left a tip under 15%, but I couldn't reward that woman's dismissive and rude behavior."}
{"text":"I am a hooters regular! I decided to go to hooters for wing Wednesday! And this one was the closest to my hotel (in town for business) and it was definitely the worst experience I've had! The service is horrible! My server took our order and didn't see her until 25 minutes later! When I tried to wave another waiter over she just stared at me and walked away! The second order of wings were mushy and gooey! Never again!"}
{"text":"Skanky, stinky and pretty divey, but I go here every year because of the wings. Keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed.  Stingy with the booze in the mixed drinks, drink beer if you can. Alcohol kills the germs here. I hope."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't rate on any food or drinks because a good 10 minutes went by without a hello from anyone while we sat at the bar on an near empty Sunday football day. Looking around we saw 3 bartenders behind the bar: 1 was on his phone and the other 2 chatting it up with others around the bar. I'm totally cool with them talking to their guests to create and experience and the attempt to make a good tip but steps of service require awareness of when new guests sit down at your bar. As we walked out we mention to a server that we were leaving because we were never greeted. She genuinely cared and tried to save the situation and asked to take care of us. She apologized and said the host was new but we know it was less of a host problem and all of the bars zero attention that caused us to leave. Unfortunately the deed was done and we were going to head to their competitor instead (where it's currently packed as I type)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch while in town for a conference. A short walk from the convention center. They weren't too busy, so we were quickly seated outside. Our waitress was attentive and efficient. Food was pretty bad. Had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. Although I ordered it with their hotter sauces, it had no spice and tasted like watered ketchup. The chicken itself was McDonald's quality. I know one typically doesn't go to hooters for the food. This experience underscores why."}
{"text":"I had a fun experience here back in January.  I had lost a Superbowl bet and was required to wear a skimpy plaid miniskirt and go-go boots with a shirt that said I bet on the Cards and lost.  I was required to go to Hooter's on Mill and so I went with a friend to get the required photos.  I was not sure how I would be received.  As it turned out, I had nothing to fear.  The staff were warm and welcoming, and absolutely excited over my attire.  I got my photos with no hassle and we decided to hang and drink/eat.  The Coronas were nice and cold and the wings decent (but not fantastic - just decent).  The fun staff more than made up for the 3 star food, though, and many insisted on getting their own photos with me.  Overall, a fun experience, and I will go back here again."}
{"text":"I love this hooters. Aside from the nice young servers the food is really affordable. The place is spacious and the wings are a good size. I can also recommend their boneless as they are delicious with the perfect amount of breaking.  I heard they make their sauces in house DAILY so your sauce preference can slightly vary each time you go.  I always get the same thing- breaded wings hot with curly fries and cheese sauce with fried pickles.  Definitely my favorite wing place. On Tuesday they have a wing special that everyone should check out."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how disgusting this place is! Great for playing but otherwise this place is just a sad dump.  I was going to MGM for the night and used the parking here at Hooters. But because I was parking there we went inside to gamble so we were consumers of the property. The charged parking down town is out of control and a huge reason I don't go there anymore.  It's dirty here, it smells and I never saw a cocktail waitress. But they might see me again for the parking convince!"}
{"text":"I ask the waitress Yesse to seat us on a booth if possible and answer us rudely!  This is the worst hooters we've ever been. I even asked about their wifi and they let me connect at palms casino wifi lol  Terrible experience. Although Summer, our server is great."}
{"text":"I stopped into Hooters for our usual Friday lunch today, with plans to just split some appetizers and have a beer, since none of us were very hungry. The hostess was quick to greet us, and allowed us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we grabbed a table near the bar.   Once we looked over the menus we realized that splitting appetizers wasn't going to work, so we ordered a thing of fried pickles to share and picked out some drinks. Two people in my group ordered beers, myself and the other person with us went with the strawberry lemonade. Little did we know that this comes with or without vodka, and both drinks have the same name... So when large plastic cups of strawberry lemonade without vodka came out we were confused. Thankfully our waitress was quick to offer us new drinks and she let us sip on the virgin versions while we waited.   I decided to order the 10 piece boneless wings, medium heat (which was a mistake looking back, medium means none apparently). I didn't like that carrots, celery, even fries were an additional charge so I didn't bother with anything other then the wings.   I don't need an attractive waitress wearing short shorts to bring me my food in order for me to enjoy it. I just need the food to be good. And it was decent... Nothing to write home about. I think I would have enjoyed my meal a lot more if I had gotten hot wings instead...   That said, I know some people DO go to Hooters for the eyecandy. Our waitress was attractive, and friendly...  she was just a little slow. Not sure if that was her fault, or the result of a slow bartender/kitchen staff.   I'll probably end up back at Hooters sooner or later but I am not in a big rush to do so."}
{"text":"The waitress name Chelsea is so kind, sweet and honest! Lost a pretty good bit of cash there from the previous late night dinner and called the next morning to check and she found it and returned every single dollar. Apparently my two year old was messing around and started stuffing money under the booth cushions and she honestly and kindly returned it. That itself deserve more than a five star. Of course I tip her well for finding it."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time, my server was Jenny really friendly an attentive she never let our drink run out always refilling thx Jenny I ordered the garlic parm wing, an I have to say dam that was good best I ever have ever I'll be sure to order this again when I get back to sd!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of wings and this location doesn't disappoint!  I came here yesterday for a lunch date and the place was pretty empty. Not sure if this is a normal thing for lunch hour during the week, but it was nice to pick whatever table we wanted and not have to wait for a waitress. We decided to sit out on the porch so we could enjoy the nice weather.   Our waitress Ashley was very attentive to us from start to finish. Once the host sat us at our table, Ashley came quickly to take our drink order and see if we wanted any appetizers before putting in our main meal. We decided on the fried pickles. Drinks were brought out quickly along with our appetizer. The fried pickles were DELICIOUS! I love how they make them here. They were hot and crispy with no pool of oil on the bottom. They did a great job at straining all the grease off of them before serving them. The sauce that came with the pickles was also really tasty. If you aren't into spicy, probably shouldn't have the dipping sauce. Not sure what kind it is, but tasted like a chipotle sauce.   For our main food, I decided on the 10 piece naked wings. Half were Garlic parmesan and half Spicy Garlic which cost just under $11. My date got the Buffalo chicken sandwich with curly fries off the lunch menu so it cost him $9. Our food came out fairly quickly, probably in less than 10 minutes. My wings were hot and fresh with more than plenty of sauces on my wings. The wings were large and had lots of meat on them. I do have to say that the spicy garlic sauce was way too hot for me and I love hot and spicy stuff, so I was only able to eat one of those. The garlic parmesan wings were AMAZING like always. My date's chicken sandwich was also delicious. He said the chicken was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of sauce on it. Also, the curly fries were nice and crispy with just the right amount of seasonings on it.   Ashley came around several times during our visit to check up on us, to refill drinks and to take away our dirty dishes. When we were ready to pay for our meal, she came out with a tray of different desserts, which all looked great, but we declined as we were more than stuffed! She took our check and cashed us out quickly. The whole time working for us, she was all smiles and super cheerful. A great waitress for sure!  Would definitely recommend this location for the delicious food and the amazing service."}
{"text":"Even though I gave Hooters (downtown) a 2 star review last time, I decided to return here when they finally offered \"All You Can Eat\" wings. The previous time I went here with a friend specifically for their AYCE wings which was advertised on Facebook BUT after entering, it was a bait & switch (we were informed that because they just opened a few weeks ago, they weren't ready yet to offer AYCE wings). The AYCE wings is offered only Monday evenings.  We arrived a few minutes before 7:00pm and were seated. After we were seated, there was a few minutes until the waitress showed up to ask what we wanted. We mentioned that we wanted the AYCE wings. In terms of drinks, I ordered a Diet Coke and 1 of the 3 people I was with pointed at the advertised Sangria on the menu and mentioned he would want this.  The waitress informed us about the \"rules\" for the AYCE wings which is that we get the same type of wings and same type of sauce for the entire evening. If we wanted a different sauce, it was an extra $1 or so. To make the best out of this \"rule\", she suggested that we each get a different sauce and even though \"our\" plate selection would be put in front of us, we could move the plates around.  Service was fast. She brought me a Diet Coke in a bottle which somewhat surprised me since last time I was here and I ordered the same thing, I had my soft drink in a glass (from a soft drink fountain). The pitcher of the Sangria came with 3 glasses and the person who ordered it, poured it into the glasses. I found the AYCE wings to be very good. The first plate that she gave me of AYCE wings wasn't actually meant for me but it didn't make a difference to me since we would be switching up the plates at the end anyways. Each order came with a cheese-type dipping sauce which no one in our table (except for one person) actually used. We each preferred just to have the wings with the sauce.  When we finished our plate of wings, the waitress came back to our table within a few minutes and asked us if we wanted another round. She was very good in terms of taking our finished wings and bringing the new plate of wings. During one of the rounds, the person who ordered the pitcher of Sangria decided to have another pitcher of Sangria.  Once we were finished with the wings and wanted to leave, we asked for our bill. The waitress brought our bills and handed me a bill. I took a look at it and it wasn't mine. From my quick glance, it was for ~$44. I mentioned that the bill wasn't mine and she took a look at it and apologized and gave me the correct bill. The bottle of Diet Coke was more than the price shown on the menu by almost double the price. The price advertised on the menu was in the $3 range for soft drink BUT a bottle cost me around $5.75. We aren't talking about a large 2L bottle either. The bottle contained roughly the same amount of liquid as a regular can of Coke so ~$6 is expensive for the drink.  For the sangria, even though only 1 person asked for it at our table (but shared it with 2 other people), the waitress without asking, divided the 2 sangrias between the 3 people who shared it. One of the people at our table wasn't expecting to be charged for the sangria that he had but did not order. There was a bit of disagreement with the bills because of the dividing of the sangria between the 3 people without asking and also for the price of the sangria on the bill.  The thing with the sangria was that there was only one menu on our table which showed the price of the sangria during \"happy hour\". When the person who ordered the sangria, he pointed at the sangria listed on the menu, the waitress did not make any mention that the price was no longer in effect even though we showed up before happy hour was over. When he asked for it again, there was also no mention that the price shown on the menu was no longer in effect.  At the end, one person didn't leave a tip because he wasn't expecting to have to pay 1/3 for sangria without being asked that he didn't order but shared with the person who actually ordered it. This caused the waitress to return to our table to ask about what she did wrong. I left less than my standard tip for not having been asked whether I wanted a more expensive bottle drink (not on the menu) and a fountain drink (on the menu).  I wanted to give Hooters a chance at increasing my earlier 2 star rating from my previous visit but in the end, I can't see myself increasing my 2 star rating due to what happened with the waitress bringing me a bottle soft drink which I believe wasn't on the menu (she probably assumed that I thought that they only offered bottled soft drinks), her splitting the 2 pitcher prices between 3 people who shared the pitcher without asking (normally in bars/restaurants that I've gone to, the person who orders the pitcher is normally charged regardless of how or who drinks), her not mentioning that the price for the pitcher was no longer in effect, and the \"stupid\" rule about the AYCE wings."}
{"text":"Had an over the top experience tonight at Hooters, (we've never had bad service here when we come but tonight was wonderful). Our waitress September was very attentive, not only that she was personable. She was continuously checking on us, joking around, and having a great time serving all her tables. It's nice to go into a restaurant and have someone who goes over the top and does more than just what's expected by waiting tables.   If you happen to stop in here & she's working hopefully you get some wonderful service from her."}
{"text":"Great experience, super cold beer and the wings were some of the best I've had. Angel took great care of us and Chris is a manager that really cares about his business."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was great! Make sure to ask for Alexis, she was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend and I had a good time last night as they do bingo on Tuesdays from 7-9. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The worst service in Vegas the last two time good luck on getting a drink or some service. I said I would never go back I won't now!!!!! Save your money and go some were they care about their customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Hooters on mill is the place to be with great service and dranks. . Tiffany or waitress was great!! Highly recommend!  will definitely come back.!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for wings, this is the place! I like here more than wild buffalo wings."}
{"text":"It would be nice if they would update their jukebox to accommodate the demographic that comes here frequently. This is ALL of the hip hop on the jukebox  very disappointed as the other music listed is not something that MOST of the people here would want to listen to"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night for wings for dinner. I was nervous getting hot wings because I don't do well with spice... I usually get wings with a sweet flavor instead of the spicy ones. But, the waitress talked me into trying the medium (after she told me that the mild wings were just basted in butter... pure lard butter...ick). So, I ate them and they actually weren't terribly hot. So, points for the waitress for talking me into trying the medium- and she even told me they'd remake them if they turned out to be too hot for me. So, this experience was a success.   Although, the time before when I was here, I ordered a salad and I had to ask 2 different waitresses for silverware (when my friends were already eating their food) and still never got any. Had to walk up to the waitress' station myself and grab my own.   I think this place is well-known enough for their wings without the gimmicky ploy to get men into the restaurant. But, it's apparently still working and the girls seem to be doing it well. So, good for them. But, because of the gimmick, this isn't somewhere where I'd love to hang out on a regular basis."}
{"text":"It is Hooters, you'll get the same food and beer at every location. They have a great happy hour and not so great food. Good eye candy, and sports on. What more is there to say?"}
{"text":"Whatever you expect from Hooters, you got it here.  Not much else to say, there's some good deals on certain days, and it's a nice place to stop by for a drink and be a leacher.  What else do you want?  You get alcohol and pretty girls serving you.  Oh yea, there's also the various sports channels.  I will say this about this location, the TVs are set up very well."}
{"text":"After dodging this place for nearly a year I broke down and stopped in.  I went to the bar where two people were working with only two customers. After 7 minutes of being ignored I left. How difficult is it to say hello and take down a To-go order? The staff is obviously challenged mentally. Considering my last visit was suppose to be my last due to terrible service I gave them Another chance. FAIL!!"}
{"text":"This was actually the first bar I ever went to in the United States and I was greeted with great Southern hospitality by our gorgeous server, Laynie.  She recommended I try a locally brewed beer which I ended up ordering for that home grown American experience.  I can tell it was locally brewed as the voice of North Carolina's icon, James Taylor, started singing in my mind (The song \"You've got a friend\" in case you are wondering). Either that or I was completely drunk after drinking a pitcher of the beer with a friend and I started to think of James Taylor.  I highly recommend this place to get a few beers during one of those scorching hot North Carolina summer days.  Have fun y'all  :)"}
{"text":"Great looking women :)   Nice place to catch a game on the giant screen TV by the bar.  The food however is terrible, and not just for your health.  Burger sliders tasted like two pieces of soft dry wall with some notion of meat in between them.  I would only recommend as a place to get some drinks and as a group hang out."}
{"text":"Besides the servers this place has nothing to offer! The wings were cold and the manager has horrible customer service. I was expecting much faster service so close to the strip but this place was slow and I wish I went to buffalo wild wings instead!"}
{"text":"Terrible fuckin service! Terrible workers! Terrible manager! If I was corporate, I would fire every person and rehire people who can manage the business! Took 1 hour for food and still never got it. Long story short, got kicked out for telling the manager that he was wrong and his workers were wrong as well. Some people can't handle the truth!"}
{"text":"Considering Hooter's isn't known for it's food, and that my friends always have a good time, I gave Hooters 3 stars where I would normally give 1 star.    The food is the absolute worst of any chain restaurant, bar none.  I would eat McDonald's before eating Hooter's.  I love, love, LOVE wings and sadly Hooter's can't even do a decent wing.  But the waitresses are always very friendly, what more could you want to gape (I mean gaze) at while nursing a healthy buzz and watching football?"}
{"text":"I just left the restaurant where I sat down not 20 minutes ago. There was no one working at the front so I sat at a table near the bar. It is hockey night so I expected it to be busy. But I didn't expect to be ignored for 20 minutes. No less than 4 servers walked by me, 3 having served me before. Well I take that back, because it's happened before. The last time it was Veterans Day and I had to mention to the manager that I had been sitting there for quite a while and none of the girls working there had noticed that I was just sitting there. Either the girls there don't like a single person sitting at a table, because of tips, or I am Frankenstein. I used to go to hoots to to 3 times a week. Look at what has happened :-("}
{"text":"First time going to this Hooters and will never be back.. first they were out of lemons, cool, then we went to order and I wanted bbq and they said they were out of bbq sauce LOL me and my boyfriend both order boneless wings (which I've gotten at other hooters and they were reasonably sized) and we get them and they are literally like kid chicken nuggets LOL again. BARELY had any sauce and were so dry. What a joke. Our chicken nachos had maybe 4 pieces of chicken on it and was basically all chips. For a 60$ tab DEFF not worth it ! When asked why they were out of everything her response was \"we're getting ready to close soon\" LOL didn't know 3 hours was \"soon\""}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to judge on appearances but as the \"Hooters Girl\" is supposed to be iconic. About half of them met what I expected however there seemed to be a serious lack of personality and training.  Normally when I walk in and recognize staff I am happy as I love to see great people bringing life to new businesses, however 2/3 of the people I recognized who work here are the kind of people I would tell friends NOT to hire, whether it be for a history of theft, terrible attitudes, or just plain stupid.  The grand opening wasn't something I cared too much about but their Facebook ads bragged about their ALL YOU CAN EAT WINGS! I'm always a fan of wings, however they were NOT available due to the (understandable) growing pains of training and warming up in the first few weeks. Them not being available is ok, but its management 101 to NOT advertise something you're not even offering. QC law could have a field day if someone decided to take up such a fight.  The menu itself looked good, reasonably priced for the area and the brand however some items were slightly overpriced. I laughed at the wings that were delivered to a customer sitting near me at the bar. Six sad little wings for $8+tax/tip. I grabbed a build your own burger. Surprisingly it was actually SUPER juicy for a chicken breast so well done on that front. Another legal issue they may run into is that for the burger its listed under the cheese that \"extra cheese is 1.99\" or whatever price, however asking for ANY cheese is considered extra, therefore the menu should read, \"cheese 1.99 extra\" such as the way it is correctly listed for added costs on certain other toppings. Not worth an argument but still, another 101 that they missed, which in QC can f*** you proper with the wrong clientele. The burger was great, however the fries were undercooked and way over salted. Have to drown it in ketchup level of over salted.  As for the service, I was definitely one of the luckier ones. I landed at the bar and was served by the fun and energetic Caroline S. Five stars for her as even the things that were out of her control/beyond her knowledge she made a point of making a good time of. Had I been served by anyone else, I'm sure I would have left with no intention of coming back, however I'll wait until they get their s*** together and give them another shot."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience and we didn't even get into the restaurant!  I stopped to eat at Hooters with 3 friends after a concert last night. We had to wait in line for ab 20 minutes even though there were plenty of tables that appeared empty. A group of young men came by the entrance as we were waiting in line and appeared very drunk, were rowdy and at one point one of the young men pulled his pants down while one of his friends extinguished a cigarette in his buttocks. A few minutes later the same thing happened. The young men then got in line behind us for a few minutes, disappeared from said line and then appeared at the front of the line and were escorted right into the restaurant.   Many individuals in the line were upset. An older man was talking to the manager and the manager did nothing to apologize to anyone for the ordeal and he did it with a smirk on his face.   What a terrible display of customer service. It's no wonder the casino wasn't that full...if that type of service runs through the whole establishment."}
{"text":"Management is a joke here dont waste your time or money go to tilted kilt instead or other bars downtown way better"}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar and ordered wings and a beer, 45 minutes later after several complaints and the four tables that came in after me were eating I got mine. Bartender is oblivious and the manager is inept. Wings were soggy but I get charged full price? No wonder Hooters is going broke"}
{"text":"What the heck is wrong with this place? November 3, 2015 I was on the road the whole day, driving from GA to VA. I've been to a Hooters perhaps 5 times in my life, and recall that they have pretty good food. Stopped at Hooters in Gastonia, NC. Sat at the bar, as is my wont. When asked if I would like something to drink, I requested water. Waitress brought back a glass of iced water with a twist. Yuck! Even the water was bad! I told her so and requested a bottle of water. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak with extra mayo and onion rings. A few minutes later the same girl behind the bar apologizes and tells me they have no mayo. Crikey! Can you imagine 5 Guys not having any ground beef? So I ordered the Chicken Bacon Melt, $9.99.   The Chicken Bacon Melt was good. I would not order it again, but it was good. And the onion rings were acceptable.  The atmosphere of this place absolutely sucks. An alarm on the back door in the kitchen went off every time someone opened it. Very loud, obnoxious noise. They seemed in no hurry to quiet the alarm, but eventually did. Each of the several times it went off while I was sitting at the bar.  And the ringer on the telephone must have been set on max volume. It would wake the dead. I understand that at night they might need it loud when the place gets raucous. (But I have a hard time imagining they have sufficient clientele to create much noise.)  The waitress behind the bar -- Katherine, was very pleasant and attentive. None of the above was her fault, although she should have been able to turn down the ringer on the phone. In my 60s, my hearing is far from optimal. But that phone was unbearable.  Next time I'm on the road for a full day I might again eat at a Hooters, but not the one in Gastonia, NC."}
{"text":"I usually don't care for hooters but this place has everything done right. The food is good and the women are hot. They have live music and they will be showing UFC fights here for free, you only have to order every hour. For this place i wilI be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I took my friend out to lunch at Hooters of South Charlotte since he's never stepped foot inside any Hooters. It's sort of like that classic Madonna song: \"Like A Virgin, touched for the very first time\" This was his very first time being exposed to Hooters.  I've been to Hooters many times when there were several locations throughout Upstate NY and Northern New England (mid 1990s to mid 2000s). This is where I chilled out with my old buddies and we really enjoyed the great tasting wings and things and the crazy hula hoop dances on our birthdays.  Fast forward to 2010! We arrived at Hooters of South Charlotte around high noon on a Friday and the parking lot around the restaurant was almost full, pretty busy. This Hooters has an open and loud sports bar atmosphere with several TVs and plenty of sports/beer related decorations throughout the place. Free wi-fi is offered here. We were seated immediately and my friend could hardly contain his excitement of being inside a Hooters for the first time. For myself, this was merely a reunion with Hooters since all 3 NH locations near my home closed down a few years ago.  Our attractive and friendly waitress promptly arrived at our table to take our drink orders, 2 big Diet Pepsis ($2.49 each) and she suggested we try the Fried Pickles ($4.99), which I said,\"Sure thing!\" The Fried Pickles did not disappoint and tasted pretty good, which were very thin sliced dill pickle chips coated in a crispy breading (not greasy) and served with a creamy and spicy dip.   For lunch, my friend had the Hooters Cobb Salad ($8.99), which was a good sized, \"more than a mouthful\" salad with a mixture of chopped lettuce, bacon, cheese, eggs, tomatoes, fried chicken pieces and dressing cups on the side. I had the 10 Piece Boneless Wings ($7.99) - Samurai (Teriyaki Style), which had a pretty good sweet taste, but were very small chicken nuggets (thick breading) for the price. I was already full from munching down the fried pickles.  The service was very friendly and attentive. The food arrived within 15 minutes and we were given refills on the Diet Pepsi. Overall, we had a pretty decent lunch with a great view. After lunch, I did offer to buy my friend a black Hooters South Charlotte tee as a souvenir, but this location did not have his shirt size Large (L) in stock. There were plenty of XL and 3XL sizes in stock for the big guys."}
{"text":"Terrible wait staff. Worst in Vegas.  The dealers are great but when you wait 30 minutes for a drink and you get zilch while playing a no-BS minimum table, that is crap.  Take your money to another casino until they fix this abortion of a wait staff."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative I would. I have been to a couple of the establishments and they are usually a great time. This one started out like it was going to be great but quickly went south when the messed up our drink order. Deanna our waitress was great, and we had zero complaints about her service. The problem occurred when we asked for a refund on the Apple Crown shots we ordered but received a regular Crown shot. There is now way to tell the difference in a shot until after taken. So we brought the issue up to our waitress which then required the manager, Chad, to get involved. Instead of doing the correct thing, and refund or make the drink order right, he argued that he was being lenient and allowing us to have the drink when we should have been cutoff. Their rule is a 7 drink limit per person. Upon doing the math of, 5 drinks total per pitcher, one drink total for and individual beer, and one drink total per shot we came up with a total of 28. The allowed total for a group of 5 would be 35 leaving 7 drinks in the bank. Moral of the story is that if they mess your order up, they are going to try and make it look like the customer is wrong. No one has time for that. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!! Don't worry I took pictures of the bill to prove the point."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience. Service was lousy no reason why I haven't been here in over five years. At least my beer pretzels were good. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"$10 buckets of beer and delicious wings! All u can eat for $12.99 every Sunday...they also give away authentic NFL jerseys for Monday night football. The patio is a breath of fresh air in a town where most bars are dark and dreary. What a fun place with great fun people to hang out with!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch since I was going to visit clients close by and was suprised how decent the food was. They had the wing special that day but I opted for the grlled fish sandwich with side of cole slaw.   The fish was larger then the bun and was quite tasty especially with the yummy tarter sauce.  The Slaw was decent too. My waitress Latrice was friendly and provided solid service.   This Hooters also has gaming, is super clean and is open 24/7."}

The cars on display,  classic style casino and Hooter's restaurant inside is just really cool.  My group dined in the restaurant and really enjoyed our food and the great service a lot.  The hamburgers were excellent and we all kept complimenting the food.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I just went to my very first Hooters ever today for my 20th bday and wow it was amazing the food was excellent and the servers were so friendly.  The Tex-Mex nachos could be the best nachos ever had in my life.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Stopped w/one of my KICK ASS coworkers for lunch last Friday.   I mean, this chain has been around for awhile and are famously known for their chicken wings and scantily-clad female servers - sounds great!! LOL  Menu items were pretty typical: burgers/sandwiches, salads, wings! I had the shrimp club sandwich and shared some wings. Salad was a tad overpriced for the quantity served. I assumed I'd be taking some back w/me, but it was pretty dainty.  I have to say, their wings are fab! I love that you can order different sauces/temps also.   Venue was very clean and orderly, including bathrooms, which I inspect w/a sharp, OCD-infused eye. Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is so unorganized and under staffed. We did not get one thing correct on our order..... except the Ice water and coke..... my husbands meal came out 20 mins after everyone else's meal. The wings were wrong (both orders). All the waitress could say about the \"missing\" hamburger was \"ooops my bad\" really?..... what does that mean? The manager was so unhelpful and actually threw a fit because we were upset that the order was incorrect and that we were questioning why my husband still didn't have a meal..... needless to say we will not be returning to this Hooters. Or probably any Hooters as this was our first time"}
{"text":"Great bar staff!!! Good happy hour spot but the service in the restaurant side can be a little slow. Food is good nothing to brag about but go here for the bar. I wish they still did UFC fights"}
{"text":"Absolutely useless. If you are interested in waiting 35 mins for food when there are 13 people in the restaurant...then this is the place for you! Better yet go on a Wednesday and get the all you can eat wings. You can get 10 and hopefully that's  all you can eat because that's all you will get. Like Chris angel your server will disappear and not bring you anymore. The most awesome part is that your wings will be dry. The problem with this restaurant is the manager is a 40 year old virgin and had no control over the women he manages. They bat their eyes and wave their \"magic orbs\" and he shuts up. It looks like he has tried to improve this place but like a said its hard to enforce rules when there might be that 2% chance. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten at a Hooters and enjoyed the food... and I've been to several of them over the years, mainly to drink (beer). What makes this Hooters nice is the staff (attractive and friendly) and the outside balcony. Mixed drinks are overpriced and really, really weak, and the wings tend to have very little meat and more skin & fat than wings usually have (and we all know that's the bulk of the damn things anyway). Sandwiches are bland and messy. I had the tater tots, and realized when they came that for the same price, I can order tater tots over at the Tavern and get three times the amount. (Whether one should be eating three times that amount is another story.)"}
{"text":"Went here for my lunch break with coworkers. The place is understaffed, only one guy in the kitchen and the food was not good. The curly fries we were served tasted like I was eating styrofoam. The medium flavored wings we ordered came out without being dipped in wing sauce. We could of ordered better tasting chicken wings from a Gas Station. They lost my business."}
{"text":"I pretty much knew that visiting this place was going to leave a lot to be desired.  The food here isnt/hasnt been/never will be good. You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else.   customer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it."}
{"text":"Well I have been to this location a few times and tonight was my least favorite experience. My family and I went for a family dinner and our server was Bianca. She came by to introduce herself and said she would be right back. Took her about 12mins to come back so we were sitting there waiting. I saw another server look at our table and she went to look for Bianca. Finally low and behold there she was. She forgot what kind of beer my husband ordered so 2mins after taking our drink order she came back to ask what type of beer he ordered. Then she came by and asked \"did you decide what you want to eat?\" We told her our order. After our order she came back 5mins later to take our menus. Seems as if this girl possibly needs more training. We didnt feel very welcomed. Also my point of view working in the restaurant business the waitresses shouldnt be just sitting around talking, drinking and eating out in the open. Thats what break rooms are for...so I thought. I'm not one to complain about service unless its horrible and I do admit the service at hooter this particular night was horrible. Its a shame too because I enjoy hooters actually have been to hooters in many cities. I was very disappointed. I live close by to this Hooters too so when friends or family are in town I bring them there. Because everyone knows what Hooters is so theres no questions is an amazing wing spot and a place to watch sports or fights on the TVs. Of course the wings were amazing so that I can not complain about. But wings without good service is sad."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Horrible Horrible experience at this restaurant. I was stand there for like 2 minute but nobody take me to the seat, so I have to walk to upstairs myself and find some one to ask if I can seat at the table clos to the stairs. I was ask for English menu but I still got French menu. Big Big disappointed with their food. Their original chicken wings are tasteless. The outside is not crisp but really really hard to eat.  The sauce are just heavy and super sour. This could be the worst chicken wings I've ever had in Montreal!!!!! The mini solide are flavorless too. The mini burger bun are just over tossed. The Beef patty are just super dry.  I have to eat with my beer.  I drink a lot of beers. I really want to take a look what kind of chef work at the kitchen??? Fatty ass are your big big advertisement, but don't you think your services and food are way too shitty???????? I would never come back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"We chose Hooters as a quick dining spot before a concert and quickly realized we made the wrong decision. Upon arrival we were greeted by a hostess that asked how many were in our party and let us know there was a 15-20 minute wait. We asked if the bar was open seating, to which she replied \"yes, but there are not 2 seats beside each other and our manager does not like it when people stand by the bar to order drinks\". To which, I asked if we could order drinks on the patio, which was also open seating, and then move to a table inside once one was ready (outside allows smoking so we did not want to stay out there). We were then told \"if you gets drinks outside at a table you cannot move inside\". What???? Who runs this place and how are they still open for business?? My husband went inside to \"go to the bathroom\" and quickly found 2 open seats at the bar, came out and got me, and we went in. As we were walking to the bar we realized that there were several open tables, all set and ready to serve guests, but they were on a wait...?!   Wings were cold and burger was overcooked. Never going there again."}
{"text":"They were quick.  Boneless wings were okay, fries were cold, Arnold Palmer wasn't so great.  However, they saved us from hanger after the king's kitchen kind of left us hanging. Kudos to you girls!"}
{"text":"Visited Hooters last Saturday night after the DBack game. I'm guessing it was 8:30 or 9 o'clock. We were STARVING and thirsty for a cold drink.   Scene.. 4 people walk up to a relatively empty Hooters.   \"Table for 4 plz.\" Hostess: \"it's going to be about 20 minutes, we are giving our kitchen time to get caught up.\"   \"HUH?\"  \"Ok so can we sit at the bar?\" Hostess: \"as you can see the bar area is very crowded, and like I said, the kitchen is getting caught up\"  Four confused people look over to a pretty empty bar area. Irritated.   \"Fine, put us down for 4 please\"  End scene.   We got a table around 10 minutes later. Lots of people walked up and turned around and left when they got the same speech. Prob not good for business not to seat people when you clearly have lots of tables.   Anyway food was ok, just munched on appetizers.   Nothing was special. Would have been 3 stars if not for our hostess experience."}
{"text":"Wings, beer & lot's of......TOTS! The loaded tots are awesome.  Came here the other day and had their chicken sandwich and it was pretty good. My coworker got the club and he enjoyed his sandwich as well.  We were seated right away & our server was friendly.  Parking can be tough since this place is in the middle of uptown but if you manage to find a close enough parking spot, this is a good place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Damn boobies n chicken that's great just terrific I love that. Just hate how it's small wanna watch a game well damn lets invite all of Peoria. But the ass is great love the girls!"}
{"text":"We did not have a great experience here with our service, but the manager did get involved and we were more than satisfied with the resolution of our issues. When we finally received our food it was good and we were happy with it.   This was basically what you expect from a Hooters, nothing too classy, but we drank beer and raised a little noise."}
{"text":"I came here for their Monday AYCE wings special. This being my first time to Hooters, I was quite curious to see how it would be, and to my surprise I was pleasantly surprised. The service was great and the food was decent!  One thing I liked about the AYCE special was the ability to have boneless wings as a part of the special (I know these aren't technically wings). They have loads of flavours to choose from;  being honest, most of them did taste quite salty but at the same time they were quite acceptable. Most of their sauces are pretty mild so if you are looking for something extremely hot, this place probably won't be for you. In terms of the actual quality of the wings, they were quite tasty and not overly crispy unlike some places I have been to.   I would definitely go back for the AYCE special, and I recommend you do too!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 2.5 stars. This was my first time going to hooters. I came in with my boyfriend and his best friend. During the entire 4 hours we were there, the waitress constantly kept giving refills to my boyfriend and his friend, but did not give me a refill. I was offended because I felt like they were being very disrespectful. I don't know if they were trying to be more flirtatious or thought that they was going to get a better tip from the guys. But I think it's wrong that the entire time I was drinking from the same drink. Only reason I was able to get a refill is because my boyfriend gave me his. Shortly after he gave me his, the waitress gave him another. I would not be coming back here again. The food was alright, but I will say I like the fact that it wasn't too crowded."}
{"text":"We got seated on the top floor  We ordered calamari and original wings in 2 flavors.  There no menu for the alcohol and found out later on that it was about 23.00 for a medium sized pitcher of beer ( we ordered 2 ) A bit pricey in my opinion.  I could easily get a 4 liter for around 20$ at sports station. Calamari was very bland...it for sure needed the marinara sauce that came with it ( although it kind of tasted like ketchup) Got the teriyaki and Daytona beach flavor original breaded wings. The sauce was tasty but the wings were warm close to cold and u could taste that it was not made fresh or it was sitting in the kitchen for a while.. Which i dont understand because we waited about 30 mins for the order to come.  Anyways we ended up with a 100 dollar bill for 20 wings an appetizer calamari and 2 pitchers of beer. Soo....basically it was my first but only experience. I dont think its worth going back.    I spent way less at other places for the same type of food and amount.   I think its only worth it to go on the days when they have specials on the wings ( thats if you like chicken wings)"}
{"text":"Great time today at Hooters, Matti our server was super nice and did a great job accommodating us, well more me I guess. It was unusually slow in the restaurant but it made for a super relaxing time. We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"There is a huge sign out front that says that this place is open 24 hours with table seating.   My fiancé and I went here one late Saturday night to get some delicious wings, and they only thing open was bar sitting. There was only one server available and upon entering into the store I did not get a good vibe. Our bartender was very nice and friendly, but after ordering drinks with water, our water cups had trash inside.  I was so disgusted with the cup, that we just canceled our order and order food elsewhere. If our water cups were dirty with trash floating at the top, then I can only imagine how the kitchen looks."}
{"text":"Lousy food and extremely poor service. My wings were not warm so they replaced them with more wings at the same temperature. Definitely was not worth the walk"}
{"text":"Surprisingly one of the better Hooters I've gone to.    The wings were good and the mojitos were excellent.  Unfortunately, as a non-local you don't get quite the attention or service you would if you come here as a local.  I sat at the bar and had good service to begin but the bartender/waitress never came to check on how I was doing.  She was too busy talking to her boyfriend (confirmed) and one of the patrons who comes here every day.  I had to ask another waitress (not my area) for bleu cheese and another drink.  The good part was the wings were very large (big issue with the Hooters in the Mass area......as the wings look like Buffalo Wing Wing leftovers in MA) and the drinks were REAL strong.  Three mojitios later and I had to go sit in the sportsbook for a while before I could take off back to South Point.  This place takes Stations Gift Cards so that is good for me (since I bought $400 worth of gift cards for $200 from the weluvlocals promo)."}
{"text":"All you can eat chicken wings, but the service is horrible, the waitresses are cute but very unprofessionals, you can tell they had the job not because they are skilled but because they have boobs, they come to see you once to take the order and then they leave and you won't see them again, they comeback only when is time to pay, the busboy do all the job, you should tip the busboy not the waitresses."}
{"text":"The only reason that I'm giving this place even one star is that they show UFC pay-per-view with no cover.   I've been here with friends about three times now, two of them to watch a fight, the other time because it was the only place within walking distance that had food.  All three times our waitress was rude and largely absent.  I'll add that we are really not into the whole TnA aspect of this restaurant, and treat our waitress like any other waitress.  No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.  We went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered \"hot\" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.  Friend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.  Friend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, \"Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?\"  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.  Overall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).  This place needs to close down for a few months and reevaluate, or just go away entirely, like every other business in the AZ Center.  Oh, PS, they have never brought out our correct bill.  Always has a bunch of random crap that no one ordered on it, and the girls act all put out when we point out that no one ordered half of the bill that they're trying to charge us for.  Keep an eye out on that receipt."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night for AYCE wings with the purchase of the drink.  Our waitress was very friendly.  Some of the flavours were good, some way too saucy.  We both have to agree that having your wings Daytona styled made the wings taste much better.  If your wings are Daytona'd, they glazed with Daytona sauce and finished off on the grill.  It makes it taste more crispier, without the excess sauce dripping from your mouth.  So, truth is I suggested this restaurant for a date, because I wanted AYCE wings.  Don't do it, because besides having your date secretly glance around, the volume on the TVs made it difficult to talk to each other.  Funnily enough, at the time we went, I was one of the two females in this packed bar."}
{"text":"Me and some friends wanted to get some lunch and decided to head over at this location. This was my first time there. We walked in and nobody greeted us at the entrance and we decided to walk over to one of the open tables. We sat down and waited for about 20 minutes for a server to come by and finally stopped one of the servers. I noticed that there were one bartender and two servers. The server told us that someone will be with us shortly. We were ok with that but it was not busy at all. then after another 15 minutes or so, I decided to walk up to the bartender and asked if we can get some service and at least get us some drinks. Finally, one of the two servers stopped at our table and took our drink and food orders. After she took our orders, we had waited close to 20 minutes and we didn't even get our drinks yet. We were there for almost an hour to get lunch and didn't even get our drinks. I got up and told the bartender that the service is bad and that we are leaving. We got up and walked away. I left this location with a bad experience and hungry."}
{"text":"Have been going to the Hooters establishments for years in the metro Phoenix area and in other state's and have always found their food (i.e. signature chicken wings and the shrimp dishes) to be consistently good: cooked, meaty and tasty. The wing sauce is simply the best.  This location is no different. As usual, the servers are friendly and attentive (good job by Kirsten)."}
{"text":"Had lunch at hooters today with my boyfriend and we got great service.   The waitress was great and the other servers were will to help if she was busy.   great team work.  The wings were great he got the all you can eat wings and they were very quick to refill his order.  We even bought the 2015 calendar to support the Hooter Girls.  Thanks for the great service we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. 30 minutes for an appetizer, server disappeared. Every time we needed our server we had to walk inside to find her. After waiting over an hour for our food she claimed she screwed up our order because of special instructions...well we didn't have any special instructions on our order. I do not recommend this hooters! Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Lemme start this out... Big boobs & small brains.  Every time I roll into hooters I order the same thing. ALL DRUMS, BREADED DAYTONA.  Every single time it comes out wrong... Weather it's not breaded or it's not all drums or they bring the WRONG AMOUNT OF WINGS OUT. Lol  Today it was not all drums. Honestly if you can't remember my order then bring paper and pen to write it down. That's pure laziness.  The reason I continue to come... Because these all drum breaded Daytona are the BOMB."}
{"text":"The worst Hooters ever. Brought about 50 people in to eat and waited over 30 minutes just to get 2 pitchers of beer. Food took almost an hour and a half. Even with us in there the place was less than half full during the NFC playoff game so being busy was not the issue. That also tells you something about the place. Servers on phones not working and bartenders with awful attitudes. Manager didnt seem to care either. Stay away."}
{"text":"What can I really say about Hooters that everyone does not already know?   I do however like the fact that it's a 24-hour establishment. On the rare occasion that I am craving late night junk food....Hooters fits the bill. The bartender working grave the other night, not sure of his name, gave great service. Im all about the service baby!!!  Wings....decent, definately not worth the price, but Hooters is always a great spot to watch the game with da boyzzzz"}
{"text":"Newer place, cleaner than most. We never get out for less than 15-20$ person, even at happy hour. But lots of TVs for sports, the frozen drinks for the ladies (and unmanly men), girls under-dressed as expected, etc.A good plan is to get snookered and roam over to Goodwill next door to see what junk people are buying. I mean, who wants a used blender? Then to Guitar Center to try out a guitar with the amp turned WAY too loud... It's like dinner and a show. As for the wings, we girls like the lack of fat and skin. The guys go hungry...No, you will not be full after an order,, but that's more room for beer."}
{"text":"I give up on this place. I used to come to this location all the time. It seems to have slowly deteriorated...first of all, the parking situation is atrocious. They bumped up the cost of meters, or you can park down the road in the expensive lot. Add to this the high cost of wings with NO MEAT on them. None, seriously, anorexic little chickens all wingless for this place. And I like smaller, less fatty wings. But I also like meat. And I do not want to spend $10 on an order of wings that result in one tablespoon of meat. Second issue is that the outdoor smoking section opens into the restaurant and stinks the place up. So, sayonara AZ Center. Worst of the chain, locally."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. We have never had bad service or food. We have ordered wings, fries, onion straws, chicken sliders, fried pickles, and ice cold beer. The last time we went I was a little disappointed in the cleanliness of the restaurant. They were not busy. The booths were dirty seats and tables. We switched twice looking for a clean area to eat in. This was the first time we have noticed the place being dirty. We will go back."}
{"text":"Was craving some wings so thought we'd catch the game here and indulge. Needless to say I told my wife I'm definitely done with Hooters. The wings aren't that great, they're overpriced and they don't hire their waitresses for good service. Arguably, they don't hire them for their looks either - doh!"}
{"text":"I guess you have to be a single dude or a group of guys to get great service from these waitresses! Thank you manager chris for making this experience right!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch after church and I was very very disappointed . I ordered fried pickles and it was marginal at best, they smelled and tasted like they were fried in the same oil as calamari or fried clams their was pieces of clams I believe when it came to me.  My chicken was over cooked. I had high hopes going in because it was my first time but I came out disappointed. I paid $25 and I tipped $5.00 just to be nice to the server. But I will not return."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time and it was great but lately my order always gets messed up or I get over charged.  I haven't been in for awhile so I went to grab lunch.   First the girl told me I couldn't get the size/type of wings I wanted for to go and offered me something else at a slightly higher price.  And I was fine with it,  went to pick up my food and stupid me didn't check before I left.  When I got to work I realized I had boneless wings (extremely small) but was charged the higher price of bone in. I probably should have called or gone back but after so many times of them messing my order up I just won't be returning there.   The customer service is always great never had a problem with that and anytime I told them about messing up my meal they fixed it right away.  But after awhile friendly faces dont make up for bad food and lost money."}
{"text":"This Hooters location has redeemed themselves via Cheyenne! She's an amazing bartender that really pays you the attention that any person in the industry should give you.  We sat at the bar, so I guess that's the key to having the service that you want, or any service at all. The food is still pretty much the same.  I found it a bit refreshing that one of the managers contacted me, it's been awhile... I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled (thanks to Yelp LOL) but she didn't even offer me anything to even \"try\" and forget the horrific experiences we had in the past, oh well.   Again, thanks Cheyenne, you're amazing :)"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of FRIED PICKLES this is the place to be!  You get a huge heaping of them for a decent price.  Only negative is the weak and watered down dressing you get with it. Nice gals working as servers--got served well and fast, so no complaints there. It's just the nickle and diming of Hooters that I dislike (i.e., if you want more Ranch you pay for it).  Hooters should change that dumb policy."}
{"text":"The service at this location sucks, they had me wait 20 min to be seated when it wasn't even packed. It was. Less than half full. I'm not sure how management is operating this location but they need to start over and teach them how to be courteous to their patrons and not focus on flirting with their boyfriend at the bar. If I could give a negative star rating I would."}
{"text":"Went here for a good bye lunch for an excellent former associate and got terrible service. The food was ok but over priced and the atmosphere was whats to be expected. Not sure I'll ever come back but the wings were not bad."}
{"text":"Service is slow and sucks.. wait is to dam  long Made a group reservation and the didn't have it"}
{"text":"Great experience!! Good and service was great!! Loved the wings!! Highly recommended going there ."}
{"text":"Apparently you must show ID for a prepaid pick up order.    I was told folks pick up other people orders. As for the wings: extra crispy extra wet was visibly missing sauce.  There's only 10 wings to the order so extra sauce shouldn't be hard but apparently 1 blue cheese is enough for 10 wings.   I can't recommend due to the license issue as they wrote my license number down on some homemade paper."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hooter's and only went because of the location.  It's close to the mall in Mesa.  I was really surprised how great our experience was thanks to our waitress Megan.  She was so nice, funny and attentive.  It's those small things like shaking the ketchup bottle for you, placing a paper towel on your lap, never asking for a water refill, etc.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the hostess was too busy flirting with a table of cute college boys to notice us.  The kitchen was also slow, but it was good."}
{"text":"Pretty coo spot, next to the amc n some shopping. Small venue n staff is kinda lacking speedy service. Just ok from my opinion."}
{"text":"Didnt even get to eat. After waiting a few minutes in a dead restaurant to be seated we were sat on the patio and left for 6-7 minutes so I decided we would eat somewhere else. When I was leaving at least three people attentively said goodbye... I normally like their wings but this was not a good experience for me."}
{"text":"When you first walk into a restaurant, the hostess is the first face you see and sets the tone for the restaurant. When I first walked in Kylie was the first face I seen as she was drawn into the phone like nobody else existed right away, I was already annoyed with the service I was receiving. Then Lily I believe her name was walked around the corner while giving off a dirty look like she hates her job. At that point I sat at my table located in front of the hostess stand and was greeted by my Amazing server Laura. If it wasn't for my amazing server I would have left right after getting those awful vibes. As I was waiting on my food, I continued to watch Kylie who I believe is the hostess was STILL glued to her phone. Working in the Food and Beverage industry and being a hostess myself I was beyond shocked that being upfront, how into her phone she was."}
{"text":"Our waitress was horrible, I'm a sever, I generally give a lot of lead way with other servers. This girl was rude and would not stop complaining about running all around the restaurant for her whopping two tables, the place was dead. I eventually had to tell her that all this running around was her job."}
{"text":"My first time ever going to Hooters, and will be my last time here. I bet anyone they got the fries from the Smith's freezer isle down the street, that was the most unseasoned curly fries I ever had. Burger was alright, if the tomatoes weren't from last week. Saggy, no color, and full of sadness. Don't recommend going there at all folks. Managers won't care either, they would rather talk smack and laugh about it, just watch and see."}
{"text":"Horrible food experience. Definitely won't be going there again. To start off my sweetened ice tea was waaay too sweet. When I told the waitress about it she said she would mix it with unsweetened.. Still too sweet. My chicken sandwich was rubbery and salty and my fries tasted like they were from the day before. My husband's breaded hot wings has more bread than wing and they were extremely dry.  :(. Not happy. The only good thing to say about the place is the friendly waitress."}
{"text":"My husband and I weren't served for over 30 minutes. All the guys that came in after us were served right away and were seated in tables in front of us and directly behind us. It's very sad how the women just served the men and completely ignored us. Maybe they were hoping for nice tips.. We told the manager about the problem before we left and she just kept making excuses for the girls. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Only received one star because I have to leave one to write a review. Came in on a Tuesday night with the restaurant maybe thirty percent full and waited twelve minutes at a table with no one even offering a hello how are ya. I then got up and left and will not be back. I went up the street to twin peaks and had a drink and my order taken within two minutes of walking in."}
{"text":"I've never been to any Hooters that has given me good service.  So our club went out here for a good time, and upon entering the waitress seemed like she was less interested in helping us.  We asked for a table for about 20 people, and she looked rather irritated more than helpful.  We didn't wait that long to get everything setup in a place that was deserted.  But hey, that was just the bottom of the totem pole.    I'm a person, who knows what to order once I get seated.  I say it out loud and maybe a little too fast, but I say it clearly.  The waitress kept on saying \"what?\" how many times after I repeated myself like 3 times.  Once everyone got their order down and taken care of it took them more than half an hour to get the orders out. LIKE COM'ON?!  There's like NO ONE IN YOUR STORE?! And when the orders did come out, it wasn't all at once. It was like 15 mins after the other.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, maybe I'm not.....but I swear, a restaurant that has no customers to service to, should have their undivided attention in pleasing the people they do have.  I don't know, maybe that's just me? As soon as my order arrived, the waitress notifies me, that she drops my wings and says... \"Sorry, we're making another batch.\" I was like ok, that made everything worst because it took me even longer to eat. There was no, here's a complimentary this for waiting for your food. NOT even a refill for my drink, which she failed to do multiple times!   This isn't the worst restaurant experience I've had, but it's pretty up there.  You should try to avoid eating here if possible.  Plus, the food isn't all that great.  I personally like Buffalo Wild Wings better, at least it has flavor."}
{"text":"I was in town for someone's birthday, and she wanted to go to Hooters.  So, I said, \"Chicken wings?  Why not?\"  The hostess, though visibly taken aback by the request for seating for 15 people, was glad to accommodate us and enlisted some of her orange-shorted compatriots to move tables together.  The service was fantastic.  Our waitresses were always around, always filling our drink orders, and always getting us whatever we needed.  Our food came out quickly, and our main waitress showed no negative signs of having to deal with such a large party.  I ordered the Wingsday platter--10 boneless chicken wings, french fries, and a choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing.  My specifications were hot wings, sub tots for the fries, and ranch.  Unfortunately, my wings were not hot, and I was ready to sweat that night!  The tater tots were bland and made me regret not getting the fries.  On the plus side, there was plenty of ranch dressing, more than I wanted.  Though the food was just all right, the time spent with family and friends and the friendly waitstaff made this a good experience."}
{"text":"Group of 10 celebrating a bday while watching hockey game. Great place to watch sport events but wrong place to expect quick food service or warm dishes (ribs and wings were literally COLD).   Had maybe a pitcher of beer each and none of us got tiny bit tipsy for one simple reason: alcohol most probably diluted to 0.5%. I won't comment on the girls."}
{"text":"One girl. Giant bar. Walked around the restaurant twice, was not greeted by anyone. Waitress was too busy with her phone to notice me walking in. Great service huh!"}
{"text":"Omg this place was soooo terrible, from the service to the food. When we arrived the place was some wat empty with a couple customers scattered through out. We were asked to seat ourselves in which we did (we decided to sit at the bar). Our \"not so friendly\" waitress came over and took our drink order, once she came back she just sat the drinks down and proceeded to walk away in a rush with out asking were we ready to order, we literally had to call after her and tell her that we were ready to order. I decided to get the beef sliders and my friend got the boneless wings half mild and half garlic. Once our order was placed at about 1:00 am we didn't get our food until 1:43 am ( I was about ready to walk out). While waiting on our food not once did our waitress come to check on us, she was too busy flirting with the guys at the other end of the bar. After the long wait out food came out, 3 words to describe it DRY, BLAND, OVER-COOKED that ish was gross the only half decent item was the curly fries. Never again will i step foot in this establishment. I don't know what was worst the food or  the service I say they run neck and neck."}
{"text":"i've had bad experiences before but at least the customer service was good. the girl was so irritated and the manager right beside her didn't even take over. MY WHOLE ORDER WAS WRONG, i literally rolled out of the bed craving a sandwich a philly with extra cheese for my sandwich to barely have cheese at all. then they added tomato no idea why when it's not included on the menu. i received a freaking CUP OF SHREDDED CHEDDAR JACK CHEESE AS A SIDE, if extra cheese on my sandwich was too hard a task to complete then i would have just gotten something else. the chicken tenders look okay not crunchy however i haven't even tasted them yet. this is my second time coming here and leaving disappointed i've dined in & this time was togo both times sucked. i didnt enjoy it one bit. i'm really over it. idk if the girl taking my order was in training or whatever but i blame management for training her on a FLIPPING SATURDAY NIGHT SMH!!! ugh the food was so bad  signed a server who knows exactly how things should go"}
{"text":"Their wings are always consistently solid - something you can always count on if you have that craving!    I was bummed to hear they no longer carry their Nippers Juice cocktail - bring that back please!!!  The staff were SUPER friendly and accommodating though.  The manager got his bartender to try and recreate the Nippers Juice cocktail which we really appreciated as we didn't even ask for them to do that.    Let me know when you bring back the Nippers Juice!"}
{"text":"Hooters is losing its \"trendiness\" for sure. Nice place overall and the staff seems very nice, they just seem as though they are faking it sometimes in a way. Beer selections are average and good is just typical bar food."}
{"text":"I'm such a big fan of hooters.. I like staying here.. not because I get free room. But looks relaxing and simple. The thing I don't like when they change the view of the pool.  Now the pool looks so boring. They remove the water falls and the plants... but I really  like staying here.. that's all I can say"}
{"text":"I've been twice to this place and service is really poor. Mika was our waitress yesterday. She asked us to show the ID card (we are 35 years old) and unfortunately I left my wallet in the car. I was trying to show her copy of DL on my cell but she insisted that I need to get it and I didn't resist much. I walked out and got it. Anyway, we got our order of crab legs. She didn't get the side plates for the shell or crackers to crack open. She was no where to be seen for next 15-20 mins. We had to break open the crab with our bare hands and put the opened shell on napkin. We asked another waitress if she could get crackers, that's when we got our crackers. The food is also not that great. Cajuan and Spicy garlic wings are extremely salty. They replaced spicy garlic with general tsos which was little better. Overall the service is so bad that this is the first time in our lives where we decided not to leave a tip."}
{"text":"This downtown Phoenix Hooters has become a comfort spot for me and my wife. We know we can always rely on friendly service, $5 32oz drafts served in ice cold mugs, delicious fried pickle slices and slightly above-mediocre oysters. The wings are pretty good too, but they go a bit overboard on the breading.   We came here a lot last fall/winter to catch football and hockey games due to our lacking of a television in our house. Basically any sporting event you can imagine will be playing on one of their many flat screens!"}
{"text":"Went to the Hooters on 83rd Ave in Peoria to watch the Canelo and GGG boxing pay per view event.  At the door they were charging $20 for entrance.  I have been there for other pay per view events for $10.  For them to raise there prices is ridiculous!  They expect me to pay $20 plus buy food and beer?  For those prices, I'll buy the fight at home and invite friends over.  Which I did .  The restaurant was empty because of the price gouging!  I will no longer go to this hooters.  What they did was get greedy."}
{"text":"Poor service, limited draft beer selection, & the smallest buffalo shrimp I have ever seen. Come on Hooters this is Vegas after all...take it up a notch. I have better service in my small hometown location."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we can't review anything but the horrible customer service. Having guys night out with my nine-year-old and they told us to sit anywhere then proceeded to ignore us for 10 minutes and we walked out  Would not even acknowledge us and checked on the tables all around us   Upsetting experience. We were ready to grub. Went to grimaldis instead"}
{"text":"Awful, microwaved boneless nugget pieces that make convenience store nuggets look high end. The garlic parm was microwaved so it separated and pooled in the bottom.  Will never waste money here again, 6 girls hanging at front and I was bothering them when I asked where toothpicks were.  Don't go for the Hooters experience. This place isn't it,"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out and i will never do it again.  It was the most disgusting food I've ever seen.  It's the location itself because I've been a fan of Hooters for many years.  When i called and complained the manager laughed and questioned me.  I told him the food wasn't editable and he laughed and said\"i doubt that\" well trust me i wouldn't feed it to my dog it looked so gross.  Never again will i order from this location."}
{"text":"I'm a girl.  Yes, I love Hooters.  Whatever. I've never had a bad experience at Hooters. Ever.  Perhaps the waitresses just appreciate a girl customer because i'm not staring at them; but the staff is always beyond pleasant.  Wings are my go to and I love them. Sometimes when I don't feel like breading, I get the Naked wings , regardless I love them.  Get the fried pickles. Yum.  Sometimes I'll mix it up and get sliders instead. I love them buffalo chicken sliders and recently a friend got the burger sliders which looked delicious.   If you want a laid back atmosphere and cheap wings and beer, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.  I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.  I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon."}
{"text":"Since having the Hooters wings in Orlando, FL. we have been craving their big juicy wings. This location was the closest one to us coming from Mississauga.  We arrived around 6:30 pm and it wasn't very busy. However, no one was there to greet us and bring us to a table. So we decided to find our own table. Our server provided us average service during our visit.  We all ordered their wings and shared a side of curly fries. I think the curly fries are overpriced for what they are. They were about $5! The wings were underwhelming and small. We had such high expectations on their chicken wings after having them in Florida. We also found it odd that they keep the tips on the wings.   We were underwhelmed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"The sign in the door says : WE I.D. EVERYONE. WE EVEN ASKED GEORGE BURNS.  I understand insurance BUT this is just STUPID.  I am 60 years old and don't carry identification with me. I believe it is a personal freedom not to have to identify ourselves in these United States. I'm obviously over 38 so serve me a beer. THEY REFUSED!!!!! I walked out never to return to support a stupid business.  So if you wish to give up your personal freedom for a few gut busting wings and a beer go ahead. The next thing you will find out is you will lose more personal freedom.  SEE:  PATRIOT ACT!!!"}
{"text":"I love hooters wings and the buffalo shrimp. the dipping sauces are a little watered down for my taste. Coming from Chicago, the way they do hooters out here is completely different, but still good."}
{"text":"Went to hooters for lunch. Had the best service ever.Hylee gave us the best service.  We couldn't be happier. Thanks Hylee for making our day."}
{"text":"I had wait 20 minutes at the bar Just for someone to take my order. then I had to wait about 45 minutes for my order of deep fried pickels. Since I was sitting at the bar I could see the kitchen and the cooks spent most of there time standing around talking for a half hour with out doing a damn thing,"}
{"text":"I'm torn. Four of the five of us had a great meal. The wait was still a little tedious. Ok, alot tedious. The fifth person was so annoyed.  The time between order and presentation of his order was roughly 40 minutes.  They weren't busy in the restaurant,  at all. When his AYCE order finally arrived, he told her no thanks, then walked the eff out. Apparently, the story was the cook made the wrong order for him,  so he waited another who knows how long before the meal came to the table. I think if that's true, she could've offered him the accidental food while the real food went in. An AYCE order, which is pricey, should not be 40 minutes between orders. Come on,  folks.... Besides that fiasco, my buffalo shrimp and ranch were on point. Still, the service at Hooters isn't really service."}
{"text":"Of course I've been to numerous Hooters around the country, I like their wings! This time I only stopped in for a drink or two however. Came in at a busy bar filled with what seemed like a lot of locals. Ashley was friendly, timely and on top of her game. Definitely better than some of the other locations."}
{"text":"Strange.  This sums up my overall experience here. I had a quick meeting with a pal who recommended we pop in here for a quick bite. It's been years since I have gone to Hooters but I fondly remember the experience and was happy to give it a try.  Firstly, the place does not seem clean. It had an old feeling and dos not feel very sanitary. The staff never smiles here also, which made me feel uncomfortable. They were attractive enough, but a smile adds several points to anyone's appearance and no smile deducts even more. Hate to be so superficial... But it is \"Hooters\".   The bacon on my burger tasted old and the bread was not soft and fresh. So I didn't eat much after the first couple of bites. My drink was also never refilled.  I felt the staff was just killing time while they become old enough to work the pole at the local strip club. The guests also seemed like they were a grabbing a bite in the way there too.  It was strange. It surely wasn't 'fun'. I'm going to stick to Firebirds when I'm in that side of town... After I get a tetanus shot."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened this place but it has taken a turn for the worse just in the last month. I am a once-a-month-at-least customer of this branch and it's is craziness how bad it has just gotten!  Seriously just waited 45 minutes after ordering to get 10 chicken wings and a salad. The drinks took forever, the atmosphere is poor. It's like nobody was in the kitchen at all!!!!  Whomever is managing this branch of this restaurant: if you're reading this please undo whatever you just did because it is not working!!!  Most frustratingly, and I understand the concept of regulars, the waitstaff spends so much time \"with the regulars\" it's like they forget anyone else is even in the restaurant. I'm surprised management lets this happened to the extreme that it does!"}
{"text":"There's always some loud mouths at the bar but the foods always good and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in the place and it was dark and had a musty smell. The wings were ok not the best. The fries were good only because I asked for them to be freshly made.  I killed roach that was running across our table. I went I wash my hands and there was a HUGE COCKROACH lying on its back with legs just moving around.  I mentioned it to the host she was in the restroom and she was like oh really got a napkin and just picked it up and tossed it in the trash. How GROSS is that!  The only other good thing other than the freshly made French fries was our waitress DANNEXY, she was super kind."}
{"text":"i mean...it's hooters  Awesome Happy Hour -  I went boneless this time and I think I made a mistake straying away from the naked Daytonas, but at $6 for 10 you can't go wrong   The service was quick, my soda was always full  The only disappointing factor was the fries. They were really stale - just not crispy or tasty."}
{"text":"As Hooter's go, great place, location, food was great. Was there about an hour before closing and they were already cleaning and closing--not crazy about servers wiping stuff down and taking out trash before they even close; makes customers feel rushed."}
{"text":"Went with husband and a friend.    We ordered food.   I ordered the blackened mahi.   I had it elsewhere in multiple states from Hooters.     Husband ordered the big fish sandwich blackened and friend ordered wings.  His was not breaded  The food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried.   The lady stated that it was breaded and grilled.  I have never heard of such and as stated I ate at quite a few locations.  Soon the manager came over and stated that she can show me where it states breaded.  When actually it states blacken season mix, not breaded.  It doesn't state it on the menu which is common if something is breaded.  Also she said that it was a new item at that location for about 6 months.  I had it other locations before just 6 mo ago (but it could be new for Arizona).  I ended up sending it back, because it was not what I anticipated and didn't want breaded or battered food.     Also since then I have been to a couple other Hooters in Phoenix and Tempe and they did not bread or batter the \"blackened\" mahi.  I will never go back here.    Didn't like the service or lack there of or the food."}
{"text":"Dead end! If you are coming from a long trip do not stop here! We waited for about 10 min to be seated, and no one ever shows up."}
{"text":"Worst Hooters ever! Walked out after sitting for 10 minutes - no service. Waitress standing around. Empty tables all around."}
{"text":"It's my birthday weekend show the restaurant manager got me a birthday cake and Rachel with the dark hair is the best bartender ever"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd favorite Hooters in town and our favorite in a Casino. I like the Wingsday special with Hot or 911 sauce and Bleu Cheese. Also try the wings \"naked\" with lemon pepper (available at some Hooters.) I have found the service at most Hooter to be above average and this one is no exception. It is clean and bright, they have an outside patio. The manager was very accomodating for a large group. They always have specials on food, 'ritas and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"I can't say I was a huge fan or hooters before I went to this specific location.  The wait staff was definitely attentive but the food was mediocre at best.  The wings were a bit dry and I found myself dipping them in ranch just to kick up the flavor.  I also had a startling revelation when eating here.  I don't particularly like looking at breasts while eating.   I guess in the future if I want that, I can cook a meal at home and eat in front of a mirror with my shirt off.   I need to get back into the gym. :\"}
{"text":"We go to Hooters for the food (yeah, i know people who read Playboy for the articles) no seriously, the wings and food is really good. This restaurant is a little ways away from Henderson but we will stop by when we are in the area. I go for the bonless, hot, bleu cheese. (check out the wingsday specal) The service is usually on par with the best of them. i secretly believe when you are approched by your Hooters girl \"hi i am wendy, i will be your hooters girl\" she is well on her way to a mba in marketing or business administration. i judge service in a restaurant by my drinks. when they get or stay empty it has a serious effect on the tip. (i tip for service.) their service has always been above average. they have a full bar, wi-fi (for those of you who refuse to keep you phone in your pocket) and pepsi products."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received at a restaurant.  I visited this location with a group of friends after driving all day, and we went based on past experiences with the Hooters brand. Sadly, we were completely disappointed.  The waitress was polite, but it took almost two hours to receive our food - after ordering.  Other patrons who arrived after we were seated received their food first.  Moreover, the waitress originally brought out three of the seven meals, and it took another thirty minutes for the remaining meals.  I will never visit a Hooters restaurant again."}
{"text":"Not so good here - their mild traditional wings did not taste right. How could you mess up a classic like that? It was a first for deep fried pickles and buffalo shrimp for me. Thumbs up for both. Talent was decent but not super friendly."}
{"text":"My third home after work and my real home.  I enjoy the wings.  Comfort food from my college days.  Service on this trip was nice.  Girls were friendly.  Walked in just after opening and slow still, so sat down and ordered promptly.  It did not take long before my food came out and nicely cooked.  Sometimes the consistency of the wings can differ from store to store and even day to day depending on the cook.  I got a good batch on this visit."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to by a souvenir shot glass.  It was not packed at all.  The staff was very helpful.  I was in and out in less than 5 minutes.  Some locations, it takes forever to rung up for a non food sale."}
{"text":"I can't believe how beautiful this new Hooters is the staff is amazing the manager Donald was so friendly this is my new home thank you PALMS!!"}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful here.  I've been in a few times and they are always GREAT.   Thank you Donald for having an amazing team.  Kelsey was our server and Cheyene helped me with merchandise.  Love the wings"}
{"text":"Stopped by for take-out order and catch up the latest Olympics.  Good service, very attentive and responsive overall.    Food order was average - did not include the usual condiments.    Atmosphere was not overly cordial. The customers generally comported themselves as if they had just recently been evicted from the trailer park.  Suggestion :  the staff is great  - the food is passable -  keep the atmosphere more conducive to a sports bar (as opposed to the last stop on the Yukon trail...no 'campers')"}
{"text":"I was seated immediately, the waitress was polite when she took my order , and the food was good."}
{"text":"I can't believe how bad service has gotten in this place, we waited for than  half an hour for some beers, even worse to get our food order. Service has been getting worse since the new management.. love Hooters but will definitely not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"So I wouldn't normally review something that's pretty much a universally known thing, but I think the Hooter's in Gastonia deserves its own review.   This place is one of the few in Gastonia to actually get a good seat for watching a game. You usually have to get here a tad bit early to grab a good seat, but they always have every game on plus the audio, which is key. The place is filled with your normal Gastonia crowd, which can be good or bad depending on how you view it. They have tvs outside on their patio, but for some reason they never turn these things on. Being a patio lover, it kills me every time its a nice day out & the outside tvs are blank.  So the Gastonia Hooter's is much like your typical Hooter's, but not a bad place to catch a game since there aren't many places to do so in town. The wings are pretty good, but the prices for both beer & food can add up quickly. The waitresses are always nice, but then again, I think they are at every Hooters."}
{"text":"Okay, if I'm being real... the food is slightly better than what you'd expect at a bar. If you were to envision a line you'd set for expectancy of quality of food in a bar where their selling point is suggestive body exposure, they exceed the line by a little bit, which was a pleasant surprise. Kudos to them.  Now for the rough part... I have went twice during UFC fights where they now charge $20 for cover charge. LITERALLY just as much as other local counterparts in beautiful, elegant, and hospitable Station Casinos. If you can get past wildly overcharging a cover based on the atmosphere they provide, it gets worse. They sent me out and refused business because I tried to pay my cover with a card. I was actually willing to pay the absurd cover just because I wanted to watch the event that bad and tried to solution find with the manager on duty saying you can charge my card directly 20 on my bill as I was planning to order food anyway and to my dismay, they literally refused me. The actual manager on duty literally asked me to drive away to my bank to pull $20 cash out and come back. I was floored.  There are much better places for sports so I haven't been back since then until yesterday. I thought \"no cover today, cross your fingers and hope for a better time\" and I was let down again. The server last night was nice... when she was around. Which, was nearly never. I had to physically get up out of my seat to track her (or anyone down) as we had not been checked up on to find 4 hooters girls having a pow wow by the kitchen not attending anyone. Me (being me) tried to watch activity patterns after that and noticed we weren't the only ones affected by it. No one was being attended. And that same pony tailed manager was on duty who refused my card for the UFC fight and didn't seem to notice or care what his staff was (or literally was not) doing. I think this location is very, very poorly managed, and customer service seems to be at the bottom of their priority list.   Don't bother."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and myself came to the location on a Tuesday night for the all u can eat wings. I order my first 20 and about half way through I bit into a chicken that was still red inside. Bone and meat! I brought it to the waitress Kelly attention and she said ok I'll show the cook. By then I was turned off and grossed out. Got my bill and the chicken was still on there. Not even %50 off!! Where was the customer service! Would like a manger follow up. Also called the location twice today and the phone just kept ringing!"}
{"text":"Got the Wednesday deal and the boneless wings were a bit too salty for my Lakers pallette. The service was not too consistent. My first server was very polite but the server changed midway and so did the quality of service. Luckily, the manager was very attentive to the customers' needs. It was okay I guess."}
{"text":"Me and my group of friends came here on a Wednesday night, for the all you can eat boneless wings and some drinks. The place wasn't packed, but the wait for the food took around 30-45mins which was too long for small plates of chicken (around 7 pieces). Keep in mind that you can only order a plate at a time, so we had long waits for every round.  We tried various flavours of chicken, with BBQ Guinness, Honey Garlic and Spicy BBQ being the best, as well as the Passion Pink cocktail which was fruity but just okay.  Overall, the food was just okay which wasn't worth the wait for each plate. However, our waitress was very nice, checking up on us pretty often and making sure we got all of our orders and had our drink refills while waiting for our food. If you still want to have the Hooters experience, I would recommend going to the one in South Shore, which as a quicker food service even if it's packed."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Burnt food. I went here with 5 other friends and the waitress served them before my food was ready and took another 10 minutes to bring it to me. We did the all out can eat wing wednesdays and only got checked on once every 20 minutes. The manager really doesnt care about what's going on hence the shorts and Pokémon belt. He was also rude and extremely underqialified for his position. Wouldn't recommend this hooters to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Here's the letter I wrote: I've done my fair time in restaurants and hospitality and the experience I had this evening truly made me reflect on all my past experiences; good and bad. I thought long and hard about all my guest interactions from serving, bartending, managing, and even from a guest perspective and could not find a time where I encountered such incompetence, not only from the bartender who could not \"dress\" a glass, but from the manager who tried to defend her lack of knowledge by saying, \"It's easier when you have a bottle.\" I don't fault someone for training; after all we all had to learn a skill sometime, but you should have the staff there to support someone who is training. If the bartender couldn't dress the glass, maybe the lazy manager should have showed her, instead of cutting out letters for the \"theme party\" tomorrow. Wait, it gets even better... So after the 20 minute attempt at dressing a mug; we gave up and ordered a bottle. Well it didn't come in a bottle, it came in a pint glass that was haphazardly dressed and thrown into a glass(you know, so the head was all salt...MMMM). My wife was nice enough to scrape it off and move on. My server who was pleasant and helpful the whole time asked if I wanted something else to drink, so I ordered a malibu, pineapple, and splash of cranberry. Now I know this drink isn't going to be hard up on the rum, but I expected a hint of coconut as I passed the drink to my wife and asked her if my taste buds were off. I then thought to myself, well it did come in a tall glass, but after the years of bartending I did for Chili's I never tasted a 1.25 oz pour that weak. I of course brought this up with the manager; Shiela, and the reply will live with me forever. \"Well you should have let your server know you wanted it in a short glass or a heavier pour.\" Really? I responded, \"That is the best answer you have for me? Your bartender can't do simple things and your response is that?\" This is when I clearly poked the angry bear inside of Shiela as she then became very defensive. Citing I do not need to be condescending and speak rudely of the bartender. Have we moved past the point of simple guest satisfaction? I didn't call the bartender a complete F*** up, but wish I would have considering how upset the manager got. My point is that there was many places I could have chose to spend my money this evening with my wife and son, I ended up making a horrible decision, not based upon the food(probably the best plates to come out of the hooters kitchen in a long while), not because of the great service Jovonne gave, but because of the lack of support from the manager who should have been there to support the failing bartender and her horrible attitude."}
{"text":"This Hooters in the Palm's Casino is surprisingly a much quieter venue than the Tropicana location Hooters. Also the food is different from the Tropicana location. The traditional wings are not the whole wings, they are the party wings...... Still cooked the same and same sauce.... but, if you are looking for that Hooter's traditional wing...... just be aware, this location is different....  Even the salads are different, I have gotten the Original Chicken Salad a number of times at the Tropicana location....... this one today at the Palms location was completely different, still good, but not the traditional Hooters food?????"}
{"text":"Okay, I just wanted to say that I know another reviewer said fried pickles were good, and I thought it was a cool idea when I saw it on the menu too, but when I ordered it - I didn't like it, and neither did the other 6 people at my table. Their wings are mediocre, too small, and too battered though, but I'm sure a fun time can be had at Hooter's given the right company and enough beer."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to Hooters I don't get it? I used to really enjoy coming here the girls were social and didn't just hang around the \"big\" tables. It used to be where you could come in and have a conversation about your team and what kind of year they were having. Now it's where you are lucky to get your waitress to pad by you and get another drink I don't mean to be the guy who gives an awful review but wow! I'm here for like 30 minutes and can't even get a refill on my coke the food is crazy greasy even for wings. Seriously I'm super sad I used to really love the hooters experience it used to be a really fun day out today I just feel like some jerk off customer who they could cate less about.  I gites twin peaks would have been the better option I'm just baffled by how much this chain has gone downhill. .."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST service we've had at Hooters. Server forgot just about every thing. Not too busy, but she was losing it! Still didn't get half our order after about 40 mins... Not impressed with this place today. Been here before and had great service, but today not so much."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Hooters in AZ. Good food, cold drinks and the girls are always awesome."}
{"text":"This is only for our experience at this location.   Waited for 1.5 hours to get in (it was super bowl sunday after the game, so i understand) and when we were finally seated, 45 mins in, and no one had taken our drinks. Other people were seated and sitting, even after being seated long after us. Finally complained and was told theyd be right there. 15 more mins go by and no one. Not a hello, not a sorry, nothing. i finally got up and went to the bar and ordered our drinks for the table.  Talked to the manager on 2 different occasions. 2 hours and 15 mins since we were seated, finally start getting food. out of the 14 of us, 3 didnt receive their food, 5 were incorrect a 1 was raw. Most all of the received was cold.  So much more went wrong, but this is enough for this review."}
{"text":"Really liked this location. Has its own parking lot. I ordered the Buffalo Shrimp Wrap and it was outstanding. Probably the best food I've ever had at any Hooters, including U.S. sites. A pint of Guinness was rather pricey but oh well. Would certainly go back and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"WTTTTTHHHH Hooters.  Everytime my family is in town it is usually their 2nd stop.   We arrive Wednesday afternoon for some lunch.  Ordered 30 breaded bbq and 2 orders of fries for dad, myself and gram and Ms. Shirley ordered the buffalo shrimp. The wings came out...took about 20 minutes which is fine.  Cook my chicken completely please.  Well they came out and OMG soooo hard.  It was like they used old oil.  The waitress returned and I said these wings aren't right.  She said ok do you want us to remake them or would you like something else.  I said please remake.  Another 25 minutes go by with the excuse of they are rechanging the oil so it takes awhile to heat up.  OK...no problem.  Finally the wings come out and I admit they did look better but the first bite, clearly they were either A) the same wings or B) whoever was cooking that day did not know how to make the wings because they were hard, dry and the breading was soooo hard to bite into, even with the sauce.  Not to mention, after the wait, our fries were ice cold and no offer was made to bring us fresh fries to go with our wings. Very disappointing meal to say the least.  We have never had an issue.  I actually love this place but not sure if I will be returning."}
{"text":"walked into this new location bc the restaurant at the Hooters Casino last time I went was absolutely awful.   We were quickly seated and our lovely waitress Anastasia came over and took our order.   We ordered 20 breaded bbq wings and an order of fries to split. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and PERFECT!!!  So glad there is another option besides the one at the other end of Rainbow.   The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was because it took awhile for our waitress to come back over and check on us and although she had brought a to go box and cleaned our table, she decided to clean other tables off instead of giving us our check.  After about 10 minutes, I finally flagged her down and asked for the bill. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Why five stars you ask?  And why review a Hooters in Champaign when I live in Chicago?  Well once a very long time ago, when I attended the U of I, my roommate and I were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks Harrison Ford.  Thats right, Han Solo/Indian Jones himself walks in, by himself and treats himself to the delicious Hooters cuisine.  There must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where, so it wasn't a big todo or anything.  That is totally random (there is a airport down the road, and Hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town, so he was probably refueling or something).   So +1 star.  So that aside, as a fried chicken review, I give Hooter's Chicken 4 stars.  The very thing that makes it unique you either love or hate,  Hooter's batters its chicken wings.  Hooters also leaves the \"tips\" on its wings too.  You can ask for them naked, but as its kind of the specailty of their wings I prefer the batter.  The batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil, so it is by no means healthy.  It does keep ok, but its better reheated if you let it go cold.  Hooters sauces are notoriously non-spicey (and I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice).  \"Hot\" is about medium, \"medium\" is less than what is considered mild at most places, it has no flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color.  Please order at least \"hot\", don't be afraid, its not hot.  The fried buffalo shrimp are pretty good too (but they go too quick).  Grilled cheese was favorite too, but some of these options are not offered as many Hooters are franchised."}
{"text":"Wow!!!   Waitress was nice but never cleared the table unless i asked her to...  if you ordered a drink it took 20 minutes to get.  10 wings and fried pickles took 45 minutes...  they didnt know there was a convention in town so they staffed 1 bar tender and 4 servers ( apparently 3 of which were new...)   the manager never helped her staff get through the night... just standing around and apologizing for the service....   i mean.... i generally dont expect a lot from hooters. But... with the little expectations this was still a disappointment.  With a full restaurant they still closed at 11pm and refuses to serve us our full drink order even though we ordered before 11pm....."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I used to work in hooters, Chicago. On a road trip, we ordered a half hour prior to arriving in Madison. The order time was 20 minutes for pick up, but we added a cushion. One of our orders was ten mild wings. This was on the Hooters online website and something I've ordered for 20 years.   When we arrived, they hadn't even started our order. We waited 25 minutes for the order. With kids in the car. The mild was not mild, it was hot wing sauce. When we went back in to ask for mild, the manager seemed irritated saying she shouldn't have to fix the order because they discontinued mild sauce, changing the recipe. ? How were we supposed to know, why not tell us that when we ordered? And One, why? Two, it's still on the menu. Three, just don't add Tabasco. She made us wait another 15 minutes for plain wings, over cooked and inedible.   Something we had looked forward to instead of grabbing McDonald's, turned into a really bad experience. The female manager was out right rude, offered not even a sorry and forgot our drinks.   Back when I worked there, a mistake order jumped to top of cook list and an app was offered while you waited and wrong order usually removed off bill.   Either change the menu to reflect no more mild, being the mild back and dump the manager who worked tonight."}
{"text":"Ordered wings to go. First time here and it wasnt too busy for a Friday evening. Lots of different seatings available, outdoor, bar and regular dining tables. Atmosphere is real chill if wanting to get a drink and some wings! Wouldnt mind coming back to watch a game in the future. I waited in front for my order and appreciated a few of the other waitresses noticing and asking if i was already helped.  I noticed on the menu they have Tuesdays as AYCE boneless or classic wings for about $17-$19."}
{"text":"Nice location.  Typical Hooter's atmosphere and food.  Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Holy MSG Batman!!!! I ordered the grilled fish sandwich minus the bun. It was a small fillet of some sort of whitefish. The fish itself would have been good without all that MSG. Just icky.   I had to send back a vodka soda because they put tonic in it instead. Bar service was extremely slow even though it was not that busy. But our server was very nice and the atmosphere is great for college sports.   My man had the grilled shrimp tacos and I had a bite, they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I thought for good old times sake I would hit up the hooters casino and grab some wings and beer. Well they were awful. Hardly anyone here and I think the fries and wings were sitting in a heat steam tray for hours. I tried to tell them about it. But I guess because there is so few clients they cannot fix the problem for me. Not the hooters I remember."}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly at hooters. I am here for a free food promotion, otherwise the atmosphere really isn't my thing.  I am not a huge fan on the entire concept of a cinemax themed restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually go here with coworkers every Wednesday (Wingsday) night after work. It is endless wings on Wednesday so you really can't get a better deal. I enjoy going and eating here because they have tons of T.V.'s playing and you can usually catch whatever game you want and ask a server to change a channel for you if you don't have the specific game you want to watch on. The food is good and fairly priced and you are also paying for the experience of eating at a Hooters. If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say \"experience\" then you have clearly never been to a Hooters. The servers have always been really nice and easy on the eye's, so to speak. I have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I'm pescetarian, so wings aren't on my radar, so when my mom wanted wings Hooters is what came to mind instead of Buffalo Wild Wings, around the corner from my house.  December 6, 2013 may have been the coldest night of the year in Las Vegas.  I made the mistake of not ordering ahead, so 35 minutes later, we are driving home.  I ordered the shrimp po-boy.  Any decent cook can make this in his/her sleep, but not this guy.    The first bad sign was that my fries were greasy & cold.  The \"french roll\" was so old that it crumbled to pieces the moment I picked it up.  I though I'd be able to just pick out & eat the shrimp but it had been fried to rubber.  This place is garbage."}
{"text":"A very disappointing visit yesterday. We were seated and greeted fairly quickly, our waitress took our order and brought out our drinks. My husband's beer was served in a chilled glass and had almost a half cup of ice once the beer was poured in. My silverware was rolled in a napkin but when I unrolled it both the knife and fork was spotty and sticky. We ordered fried pickles and chipotle honey boneless wings off of the happy hour menu and I ordered a side salad. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out and came all at once. The food tasted good but we were late to our movie because of the delays. By far the longest wait for food at this location to date. We had contemplated trying one of the other places at Arizona Center instead, maybe next time we will."}
{"text":"Went here on a date wth my boyfriend unfortunately service was horrible. Hostess wasn't friendly at all, as we entered the restaurant the girl didn't even smile... service was okay but our waitress didn't even know the price of our drink... told us a pitcher for sangria was 12$ and it turned out to be 35$ lol... on top of that the waitress took forever to give us our bill and as we left the hostess didn't even acknowledge us, even gave my boyfriend a dirty look as we were leaving. Never coming back again. On top of that, bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible horrible! First, they were not even busy. Our waitress Kyy, seemed to only have 2 tables. Yes, that included ours. It took about 10-15 mins after placing our drink order to actually get our drinks. Then after my ice melted I got to drink my ice, since our waitress wasn't seen again for another 15-20 mins. We saw her again to order order our food. Which she did not even do right. When we got our food. there were no plates, I actually had to ask, for a plate and my extras which I had said in the beginning, when she took the order. The wings that I ordered were kinda dry and warm not even hot considering that she didn't  have but 2 tables. There has never been a hooters that has not gave you plate before your wings arrived. So in the end, she gave me the bill, which we had to wait another 15 Mins for her to even pick it up.By this time my daughter and I were the only table. We were looking for anyone to help at this point. She finally came over took our bill. I wanted to leave no tip since I got 1 refill in a hour, the wings were dry and the service was horrible. But I did anyway, since she called my daughter a princess. I think that was the only positive thing that happened at hooters."}
{"text":"The food was horrible here! This is not the way hooters use to be. The waitresses use to be energetic and fun. Now they are just regular waitresses is a skimpy outfit. This location in particular had a smoking area near the patio but inside you still smelled the smoke. The smoke was very bothersome and triggered my asthma. My father in law was coughing up a storm too. So sad my father in law wanted to come here and it wasn't what it use to be.  The food was not great either. My lettuce on the salad was huge like it was taken out of the bag. The chicken was not great at all. The mild sauce was on the side and it looked like left over grease.   I'm really surprised this place is still opened."}
{"text":"Everyone is only reviewing this place because the servers take a while longer than normal but judging off other positive reviews the food seems amazing.... leemme check quick lol"}
{"text":"We love Hooters!! Wednesday Wings day is awesome and the peanut butter pie is to die for! Girls are cute, but not amazing..  All in all it's a great place though I wish it had the same menu as the Hooters in California. Lemon pepper wings... Just saying!"}
{"text":"I've been to probably 10+ Hooters all over North America and this was the most disappointing. We had to wait 15 minutes for our drink order and it wasn't even busy. The margarita was just syrup with no tequila. The hot sauce was not hot. The curly fries came out as potato wedges and we didn't get any blue cheese with the wings. Overall pretty poor."}
{"text":"This place is on the ASU campus. Could use some updating.  Service was ok. Food was not that good Loaded Tatter tots didn't have much cheese or bacon on them bland and should have been cooked longer.  The wings okay nothing to write home about.  Staff was not very attentive, service was slow.  Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in for a weekday lunch on a Tuesday for BOGO wangs. Service was quick, food came out on the slow side (for it being fairly empty), but wings were good. The 3 stars is due to cleanliness and speed of food delivery.   Walked in, greeted, and seated right away. The table had some crumbs, but the waitress apologized and cleaned it promptly. The menus were a different problem though - they were sticky and gooey. Gross! But we put in our drink and food orders right away and waited. Drinks came rather fast, but the food took some time. There were maybe a total of 10 people in the restaurant (with our party being 4). I'm a patient person, but the place was empty and we did not even order a ridiculous amount of wings. Not sure what the hold up in the kitchen was, but we waited a good 30 minutes sippin' on some water.   BUT! When the food did come out, it was really good. I don't come here for the waitresses - I come for the wangs! They are a good size, well-cooked, and not over nor under sauced.  You can't really complain about a good chicken wing with a side of sports. However, you can complain about dirty menus and relatively slow food. Not impressed, but not unimpressed enough not to come back because their wings are damn good."}
{"text":"Well you know why you come to a Hooters and it's not for the food and service but this location you can't even come to have a good scenic view either.  I always order the same thing, buffalo boneless wings and they chicken tasted fake.  Service was extremely slow. Not that I have ever been impressed with their service but this time it was even worse. Took almost 30 mins for our wings and not once did anyone come to the table to update us on when our order would be out or if we wanted anything else in the meantime. Mind you the place was empty so it wasn't like they were completely busy. Our server was actually sitting in a booth eating...very strange lol."}
{"text":"Only go here if you really enjoy the food from Hooters because the service is very disappointing. Each time we go here we except poor service but we are such a fan of their fried pickles and Fat Tuesday slushies. There are girls always sitting around with customers or standing around in groups talking to each other. Seems as though they don't work to deliver great service they spend extra time with customers they think will tip them well. For instance a table full of guys flirting with the server will get excellent service, but when my dad and I go for lunch we're lucky if we get refills. Will all of that said, the food is still great and will probably return (with low expectations as usual)."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here and the place is a little dirty.... Went to grab a beer after a Cards game.... Cold beer and Hooters girls that's why people come here...."}
{"text":"For some reason, I've never been a big Hooters fan. I just never thought their wings were all that great. Yeah I know. Wings are probably not the reason people go to Hooters.  Anyway, my cousins wanted to eat at a Hooters last weekend and this one happens to be the closest to their house. It is also the newest location and by virtue, the nicest. Coincidentally, the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl was going on at the same time. I'm happy to say that Hooters fought our hunger quite well that night.  I went with their Chicken Cobb Salad ($8.95). It's a great portion and filled me up. Granted, it's not the healthiest salad in the world with all that breaded and fried chicken and all that bacon. But then again, I'm not the healthiest eater in the world either. Bottom line: it was delicious.  I guess no Hooters review would be complete without mentioning the girls. Yes they were hot and distracting. But I have to give it up to the one who greeted us upon entry (I didn't get her name). When we came in, all of the screens were showing the bowl game. My cousin wanted to watch the rest of the Laker game. She stood there for what seemed like ten minutes trying to find the channel. Little customer service things like that make a huge difference in my opinion. For that simple reason, I give them a solid four stars."}
{"text":"this place sucks.  I ordered a build your own burger,  which was good. fries suck. they weren't freshly cooked or didn't taste like it,  which I got and didn't even order. got my onion rings 10 minis later which also sucked.  FYI waitress..... panko and beer batter aren't even remotely close.  huge difference. just sayin.  waitress was in training.  that was fine but dont leave the poor girl to the wolves! check her shit so she doesn't fuck up customer orders. she was very sweet  and did forewarned us she was still training, which was nice of her.  ordered wings half boneless, got all bone in. not a huge ordeal but wasn't in mood to get incorrect food. all in all, I won't come back."}
{"text":"This Hooters was a lot better before the Hooters Casino opened up in the old San Remo on The Strip. The girls were prettier and the atmosphere was better. Now that the Hooters Casino is open that property takes all the A-grade girls and the left overs here can't wait until a spot opens up in the casino so they can boogie on over.  On the plus side, this is a convenient location and the oysters aint too bad."}
{"text":"I'd only give this place one star for the food, but the beautiful girls with great personalities saved it! I had fun talking with them and the atmosphere was fun! However, food is pretty mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"Horrible service yet again. Went Friday night and after 20 minutes with no service after being seated, we had to get up and ask for a server. Ordered drinks & wings and 25 minutes later nothing received and no one checked on us. Went to the manager who was chatting with patrons and in general doing nothing. Got drinks and 40 minutes in-still no wings but waitress assured us almost done. 15 minutes later-still nothing so we got up, walked out and went to Native New Yorker and got everything within 20 minutes. Funny thing was - all the tables around us were having the same issue. This place just plain sucks and will not be going back. You have a ton of girls wandering around with no designated zone and a manager who isn't doing anything to help the situation. Ps-it doesn't take 45 minutes to fry wings."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt a truly crappy experience. Was greeted pleasant enough, but after getting beer, well never saw the BARTENDER again as I WAS SITTING AT THE BAR! SAT for about 10 minutes waiting to order food. No one came...Meanwhile half of the staff is congregated in the corner flipping their hair trying to I would assume who is covering what. To say disorganized chaos is doing a disservice to disorganized chaos. I would say for wings....A bag of Foster Farms Hot Wings and a 6 pack of beer on couch would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality of wings. Not much sauce and very very dry. Highly doubt I will be returning!"}
{"text":"So me and the wife finally made it out to Hooters we heard they have great wings. Which they do but for us, thats about it.  We were seated quickly and the waitress was friendly but that doesn't make for a great eating experience. First the menu is very limited and EVERYTHING!! is ala'cart. Even down to celery and ranch or blue dressing for your wings really? On Wednesday is all you can eat wings $12.99 I went with that naked not breaded and the wife ordered the steamed shrimp 1/2 pound for $10.99 mind you that's all, it doesn't come  fries or salad $5 more for a side salad. Our food came out rather quick but my wings were breaded NOT naked, Hmm by design? Fill you up on the breading means less wings they have to bring out.     a third of the way through the meal my wife found a shrimp that wasn't de-vained , rather unappetizing, my wife brought it up to the waitress she said she sorry and would let the manager know. Manager never came by then my drink needed filling didn't get filled. A few minutes later she came back and asked if I would like to put another order in (unlimited wings) I said no thank just a box to go please. 5 to 7 minutes later she comes back, would like some more wings? I said no thank you just the box I asked for 5 minutes ago. I got the box and we left. Definitely not impressed and no Honey BBQ sauce for the wings come on.   Definitely wont be going back."}
{"text":"breaded or naked wings, both delicious.  service was a little off maybe because we were sitting in the back of the bar section so we had to ask the bartender for a waitress.  other than that.  HOOOOTERS ;)"}
{"text":"Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs ... So for that u get two stars bruh"}
{"text":"Five minutes at the bar. Not a glance. Not a promise and menu. Nothing. Very busy with a bday party. Good for that person. Not for anyone else. Pretending that Hooters deserves a review at all, this one sucks. Go to Putters. Go to PT's. You're welcome."}
{"text":"The hotel was abit rundown and needed cleaning. There was a lot of dust, the elevator made strange noises. The room hadn't been vaccumed, and the bath room needed some repairs. the cafe had week coffie and was very over priced. Over all not worth the price"}
{"text":"Food was average at best. The service was awful and the girls were not that pretty. I expected more from a hooters in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came late in the afternoon so it wasn't busy. The service was on the slow side but the waitress was really nice. The food was great. We had the shrimp, tots, garlic parmesan garlic and spicy garlic."}
{"text":"Bad customer service over all food was decent, very disappointed with this staff, FYI they won't even separate your sauces so don't count on the manager being courteous, you've been warned"}
{"text":"Just left this Hooter's after eating the most foulest oyster.  I have never tasted something so horrible.  I pray I don't get food poisoning from it.  Told our waitress about it and got an \"Oh\", that's it! nothing more. The overall service was fair, nothing great.  Food was fair, but the bad oyster and the total lack of concern is the reason for me giving one star. I never give one star.  If I die tonight let this be a warning to all who thinking eating oysters at Hooter's is good idea.  It's not!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some buddies for some wings and some drinks. Waitress Katie is great and very helpful.   Cheesecake is fuego too. Gotta love Hooters!!!"}
{"text":"I am seriously happy we came here!! We ordered cocktails, a beer, the shrimps and wings...we did Daytona on the shrimps and should have done it all that way but whatever, you live, you learn and you look at beautiful asses, faces and just go on with your day. The service was above par but please have the cute and pretty hostess wear Hooters get-up and not look like she is serving Yogi Bear his last supper. Otherwise the downy that served us was very nice and the wings were HUGE! Cooked all the way through and besides our bad judgement on the medium sauce (which is basically butter) damn goodness in my mouth. All the way Daytona :) shrimps rocked, downy waitress rocked and wings were huge. Great, super clean atmosphere, great staff and will return for both the food and atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"I was on the way home and decided to stop at Hooters for hamburger which would of course be a takeout order. I stood at the bar that's where you pick up your takeout orders . I was totally ignored by the  girls behind the bar, they were so concerned about taking care of all the men that are seated around at the bar area.  I finally had to shout, raised my hand to say hello can you help me.   A customer is a customer no matter what ."}
{"text":"I hate this place. It is always rude waitresses and food sucks. But it is one if the only places that has the UFC fights that are close to the house. And bugs.. Saw bugs on the back board in the booths and on the window"}
{"text":"We like to go to hooters for the All you can eat wings.  I wasn't impressed with their with all the wings this time.  Each time they came out different, one order came out with the perfect amount of sauce, and the next time they came out drenched and swimming in it.  Seems to be no consistency.    Girls were friendly as they always are, they need to work for their tips.  Lots of families in this location this time.  Most children under 12 I have seen in a Hooters.  It is family friendly!  :)"}
{"text":"This location is in desperate, desperate, desperate need of a remodel! I had heard a one point they were going to, but nothing as of yet. The exterior is worn and dated. The interior is dark, dirty, dingy, disgusting, sticky, filthy. The men's restroom is so disgusting is almost makes me want to hold my bladder! Maybe TMI but, it's a true statement.  I like some of the management, but a disgusting facility is a disguting facility. Maybe it's time for a Hooters corporate management intervention! If you don't put money in to a facility, why should patrons car about supporting your business?"}
{"text":"Closing down soon. Stations casino bought the Palms. they don't give a Hoot about keeping Hooters around  So get your memorabilia T-shirts and tanks"}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday for their All you can eat chicken wings. When we first came in, the place was pretty empty, so we took time to look around. The design of this place is nice, everything is orange and black, they have three floor, the higher you go, the more games you have, like a pool table, darts, etc. We were on the first floor near the bar, which was nice to have our drinks fast.  We made our first order, because the place was pretty empty it came pretty fast, but for the rest of the evening the service was slow because the place was packed after 6 pm. The waitress was really nice, she answered all our questions and also made some suggestions, she took the time to talk with us even if there was a lot of people.  For the chicken wings... you have to order at least three plates to make up for the price (because you have to order a drink), and not all of them are worth it. We took the Cajun (4/5, they were good sweet and spicy, with a nice taste of thyme and cumin), the Lemon and pepper rub (4/5 loved the lemony taste, they had a nice crush), Teriyaki (2/5, they were too sweet and very small, not a lot of meet on those ones, mainly sauce), Guinness BBQ (3/5, they were nice but not my favourite ones, it tasted like a regular BBQ), and to finish Garlic and honey (3.5/5, good but not enough garlic taste, and i think they would have been better fried and not naked).  I don't think I will go back without a special occasion, I think you can find better chicken wings at a better prices elsewhere in Montreal, but if you have great company, GO!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  Went to go watch the UFC fight and ate and drank 30 dollars worth.  I got there before they started charging the 20 bucks to watch the fight.  I put my chair up and went outside for no more than 1 minute and the General Manager actually refused to let me go back in to my seat without paying the entry fee."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hooters and will be my last. I ordered the shrimp tacos and curly fries, the menu stated the tacos were loaded with shrimp. If 3 baby shrimps are considered loaded then yes ther were. The tacos were loaded with cabbage to cover up the fact that they were lacking shrimp and my fries came out cold, after waiting a while. My friend also had some cold wings! My friend ordered her wings naked and got them breaded. My husband ordered the Philly cheese steak with the stuff on the side and everything was not on the side. You can tell that there is bad management at this establishment. I knew it when we walked in and saw how the staff behaved but against my better judgement we stayed to eat. At this point the manager hasnt come to our table and I suspect that there wont be a visit."}
{"text":"Great experience   Food was quick and hot.  Service was excellent. Dannion was awesome.  Had wings and buffalo chicken dip. Both were great and consistent   Off the strip so not easy to get to but a cheap and easy cab ride to the Palms."}
{"text":"Sooo after traveling and a few beverages in the hotel room, we decided to keep our dinner plans simple as I wasn't interested in getting dressed up. I joked w my travel companion about how close the hotel was to hooters and his obsession w chicken wings is no secret, so part of me wonders if it was all part of his mater plan in choosing our hotel! I had myself a cheeseburger-and it was better than I had expected! The Curley fries were good too! I was a little more adventurous with my beverage-I had the berry Long Island iced tea. I felt rather girlie as it was pinkish purple in color and I'm usually a beer girl, but it tasted great! Kelley the bartender was pleasant too. I'm probably going to regret saying this, but some of the girls working there don't make the \"uniforms\" look all that good.."}
{"text":"Not sure what I expected but it was rough. Smelled like puke near the bar where we were seated, not sure why (literally made me nauseous, not sure how the poor servers were dealing with it).  Tried to eat at the Saloon bar first but couldn't get service & it was smokey. The food (small menu) seems over-priced, naturally since it's practically on the strip. I thought ordering the fried pickles were a safe bet (arn't they known for those?!), I was wrong- they sucked.  We decided to drink down our drinks & find fresh air..  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Whoever owns this location should fire the manager. I've ordered Hooters to be delivered through UberEATS and on multiple occasions the order was canceled on the part of the restaurant not UberEATS. I've tried calling the location and nobody answers. I'm sure I'm not the only person this has happened to. How much money are you losing due to bad management?!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever received !!! Took an extremely long time to get our drinks . Then one was wrong and we still got charged for it . All the girls did was hang out by the register and talk to each other , or flirt with the cop when he came in .  It wasn't busy at all .  Extremely disappointed . The manager was nice . We had to ask him to get our drinks once because she forgot to bring them ."}
{"text":"6:30 we stopped in with a buddy who lives out of town.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait to be seated. Ok. While we were standing I counted 4 tables free to the right, and 7 tables to the left. The tables were left dirty and were not bused. So this has me very confused because 11 tables were available but they weren't bused.  I told the hostess that the 30 minute wait is bullshit because from where I'm standing, I counted off the tables available.  She acknowledged the free tables, but gave the excuse the kitchen is backed up.  That's not my problem, wouldn't it be nice to allow us to sit and have drinks for a while? The light clicked on and she agreed to sit us.  Our waitress was very nice and apologized ahead of time for delays from the kitchen. We ordered appetizers, and beer. The appetizer came out really fast. We ordered our meals shortly after going through the appetizer.  I ordered the Cobb Salad and chili. Chili came out with the rest of my tables food, but the salad did not make it. She said she was heading back to grab the salad. 1 bowl of chili later I was told that the kitchen ran out of mixed greens, but someone had ran out to grab mixed greens from somewhere. She did bring some fries to the table to hold me over, thank you I liked that.  By the time the salad arrived my party was ready to leave.  I can't remember our waitress' name but she made a bad situation better by keeping me in the loop, and hooking me up with some fries. The blame lies directly with the manager of this restaurant. He should be demoted and forced to rinse mixed greens for the next ten years.  Asinine having people wait when there are available seats to be filled.   Instead we were left to stand by the door staring at empty seats like a bunch of gibonni's.  Before we even pulled up my Girl Friend told us that she's been to this Hooters 3 times before and each time was a train wreck of an experience. She was dead on the money this place is a circus.  For me I'm walking away from Hooters for good. I'm sure a chimp could run this store better then the current manager. Noob!"}
{"text":"They get a 4 star just off the buffalo chicken dpi and they are playing the pacquio fight. I'm a woman so I can't go higher than a 4.... Even if the food is bomb... A little difficult to find compared to others. Set up is a little awkward. I nearly walked past the hostess booth"}
{"text":"OK, OK... I finally went and ate at a Hooters while I was on a business trip.  Their supposedly best hot wings aren't even close to being the best.  The food wasn't all that either...  Sure, there's pretty girls prancing around with their old school bright orange old school NBA short shorts, but it doesn't make the food taste any better. Then again, I guess you don't really go to Hooters for the food. =P  Recommendations: N/A"}
{"text":"Who manages this place, there is a line out the door and a wait and there are nothing but empty tables. Hostess said they are understaffed, not really my problem. Poor management is Hooters problem and they need to fix it. Worst hooters I have ever been to and not consistent with the brand."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm saying this but we were hungry and Hooters was solid. The location seems like it's new or recently updated. Everyone was smiling and polite at 10p on a Saturday night. Food came quickly and our order was correct. The restaurant was very clean even though it was full of people. There are tvs everywhere, if you like that sort of thing. They've got a new updated menu but the wings are still great! 2 boneless wings x10 and 2 sides of fries $30 w/tip. I rather come here than the Hooters by Pineville."}
{"text":"Biggest s^%t hole ever and 2 times worst experience of my life. Happy bday to me! one person says I'll comp your food then make you pay!!"}

Came n solo to watch dodger opener game..she got it on TV ASAP for me and also put the volume up for me..she filled me n on HH food specials rt away..I arrived rt at 3 wen HH starts...her suggestions on food wer so yum! ..thank u for the awesome service ! Ask for marketta!"}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Came in after a diamondbacks game and it was busy however the people that came in before we're seated immediately and there were open tables everywhere but the hostess disappeared and my husband and I stood there for 5 minutes literally, waiting to be seated. Once we were seated it took another few minutes for the waitress to come over and asked if we wanted to order our food. We put in our order and waited 45 minutes for some simple bar food. Someone other than our waitress finally brought our food and it was cold so apparently it was ready and sitting there for quite a while before it was brought to us. We did let the manager know and he did take off the cost of some of our food however it wasn't enough to make us want to come back again."}
{"text":"While my experience with Hooters has never been anything but mediocre, my parents love to come here and eat. Last weekend my siblings and I joined them there for dinner, I wasn't expecting the food to be any better but the service was extremely disappointing! After bringing out our food, if it wasn't for swiftly walking by with head down, I would have thought our waitress left. We had stacks of plates in front of us- gross! My dad got up to find a manager, which wasn't hard considering he was standing at the bar passing it high fives, he explained the situation at our table and returned. Minutes later our waitress arrived asked if we needed anything and brought us our check. The plates still there. Finishing our drinks, my mother flags down the manager explaining the situation that he has already been made aware of. He tried to cop an attitude after she called him out for standing around- not smart. He removed TWO plates and set them on the wall next to us, not a joke. The other plates were removed as we were leaving. Hooters lost me a long time ago but my parents, who are there at least once a week are considering not going back!"}
{"text":"I know Hooters isn't exactly fine dining but the service is always so friendly and nice that it deserves a good review. This is where we go for wings and a beer, they are good. We aways get the regular hot wings, the medium sauce is more like margarine or something. Sometimes the boneless wings are dry.  We bring our kid with us and the girls always stop to say hi to her and give her a balloon.  Love the service, always great."}
{"text":"Below avg.  and highly disappointing. .    Came in during lunch. Wasn't busy by any means but yet still waited over 45 minutes for 4 simple orders of wings.    Service was ok. Wasn't terrible considering she was training someone but could have been better, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that our order was taking longer than usual other than it'll be right out. When clearly that wasn't the case.  .   Once our order came. The wings lacked all flavor.  I ordered Medium and Honey Chipotle and medium just tasted like breaded chicken breast.  The honey chipotle, same bread in with a drizzle of syrup style sauce.    Can't say I would come back unless it was extremely convenient."}
{"text":"Gina was our waitress. Cute girl, very friendly and efficient. With our waters, napkins, food, lemonade...everything...she was on it. We were on a bit of a time crunch but didnt have to rush her so our timing worked out. Nachos are good but i wish they had half portions! wings of course are good and there are tv's everywhere"}
{"text":"First time at hooters and I wasn't impressed the food was like what ever and the service really lacked common sense .we had to ask for silverware and I can't understand why our waitress didn't even check on us .. I did like the set up but for a first time I just wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"typically enjoying the food at hooters and the service not being too terrible me and my friend decided to come here on a monday night to watch the playoff game. upon arriving the hostess who I'm going to assume is new was very confused as to what table to put us at. she handed us the menus at the front door and then we followed her, not a big deal, but I've never known a restaurant to have customers carry their things to a table. she takes us to a table but as we begin to sit down she tells us we can't sit there. why? no clue. finally we get to a table towards the back of the restaurant which is fine. once seated it took our server 12 minutes to get to our table to greet us so at this point we give her our drink and food order- 2 beers, 1 order of boneless wings, 1 order of wings,side of fries, and a water. 23 minutes later she brings the water and then tells me they are out of the beer i ordered so i told her to just bring me whatever ipa was on draft, still NO beer for my friend. 7 more minutes pass and then we both finally get our beer. at this point it has no been 30 minutes so one would expect our foo to be out soon. was it? no. an hour and 7 minutes later another waitress brings our food out, fries are mising, and our current server has not been back by at all so i wrote our next order of wings down on a napkin and gave it to the runner to just give to the server. 13 minutes later our server comes by to let us know she out our next order in, and we let her know we are still missing our fries and my friend would like another beer.  24 minutes later our second order of wings comes out but do our fries? nope. so i tell the runner yet again were missing our fries. 5 minutes later we finally have those.  server then comes back to tell us the beer is coming out as foam, after watching them trying to pour it the keg had just kicked, i would've told them but she never came back. while there was a game going on, the restaurant was only half full, & very understaffed. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years including being a corporate trainer and i have never in my life experienced something as bad at this. There was no teamwork between the staff, no communication between management and guests, no help from management to staff as well. if you're staff cannot handle the rush you are having then go on a false wait, pick up tables, help the bartender make drinks, something. not just stand at the kitchen window yelling hot food when you could be running it. while i do feel some type of sympathy for the staff because you could tell they were overwhelmed many things could have been done about it. this is not the first time I've had an issue at this store and until something changes i will not be back and i will let my friends know about what happened."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for about 36 hours, I lunched at Hooters twice. It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball.  I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat. I sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well.  It was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own."}
{"text":"The wings were as expected at a Hooters. Not better or worse than any other Hooters. The service was absolutely horrible. We saw our server exactly three times, when she took our order, when she brought the food and then when she brought the bill. That was it. No checking on our drinks (which were all empty)."}
{"text":"Well, they now charge double of what they use to charge for entrance for the fight, they give u smaller beers also. I'm not sure what's behind the whole cost cutting but not liking it. Food is average and it's been chaotic at times, so we stick to the place for the beer and UFC fights. Now with that changed, definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"***DON'T USE THE GROUPON *** We used their groupon and was still over charged, manager didn't seem to care or look into the bill. Very disappointed with manager and lack of customer service. Wont go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Hooters over the years. Been happy with the consistency of food in both Canada and U.S. Not so in South Charlotte North Carolina near Pineville NC. Ordered boneless wings with a dry rub. Previous orders in Canada and U.S. were a really good size, kinda like chicken fingers. Ordered here, I received 10 tiny nuggets, each smaller than a quarter. Disappointing. Oh but hey to be fair, they did give me 2 slices of celery; each about the size of an apple stem."}
{"text":"I've always had decent service here. The wings are awesome, service was quick each time, parking is always easy and everyone is friendly. The biggest issue we had was we were here to watch a ball game and it was raining heavily for about 30mins, all the TVs went out and we missed the last part of the game.I think it was something to do with Direct TV and heavy rain affecting the signal. I would recommend this place until your watching a ball game!"}
{"text":"Never again. We (my best friend and I) had order the buffalo shrimps, mozzarella sticks and the pretzel appetizer. The sauce for the pretzels was nasty and the buffalo shrimp you can tell where just regular cooked shrimp from a bag put in batter with buffalo sauce. Now we went at like 4 and now here it is a 2 hours later and I feel sick like throwing up stomach hurt  I had high hopes for hooters. But I give it to brandy she was a wonderful server.  only reason for the"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch.  A modernized Hooters.  With all nice new chairs, booths, TVs, the whole 9 yards.  Same menu you'd expect.  Same theme-dressed servers you'd expect to see.  Had the Daytona style wings and curly fries and ice T.  It was good and hit the spot.  Pushy waitress asking if \"everything is ok\" 1 too many times.  Otherwise what you'd might expect."}
{"text":"Where to begin.  The appetizer was brought out in a timely manner and was at a decent temperature.   My boyfriend ordered a draft beer and it was served in a not cold glass therefore it was warm. His food was brought out and the one who brought it gave us 2 plates. We had to ask about where my food was.  We were given some excuse and it was ten minutes later before my grilled chicken sandwich  (which I ordered with no bun) was brought out.  My boyfriend did not want to start eating his wings until I got my food so he had them take them back so he could have hot food. When order finally showed up, he had wings brought to him but it was not the ones he ordered.  He made mention he would just eat them however they brought him \"what he ordered\" but it was still wrong. It took forever for our empty glasses and appetizer plate to be removed. I lost track of how long my boyfriend was without a drink. Not too long after he drank the warm beer he ordered Moscow mule and I ordered the passion pink. We had to ask where our drinks were.   We needed to get on the road so we just went to the register to get our check instead of waiting for who knows how long it would take. We kept on getting excuses from the waitress. My boyfriend did talk to the manager who did give us a discount and advised to call corporate as they are having issues. We wished we would have checked the reviews before going"}
{"text":"They took almost 1 hour to get our food out. Management is very bad , workers yelling at each other just a mess in general."}
{"text":"I have to say, I feel terribly disappointed. Tonight I called and ordered 20 breaded, medium buffalo wings and an order of fried pickles from Hooters. I drove the ~3 minutes to the restaurant, got my order, and headed home excited to enjoy some Hooters wing deliciousness.   When I got home first thing my wife and I tried were the pickles, which were soggy, and tasted doughy. Next I opened our container of wings, only to find that they were unsauced, and sitting in about 1/4 inch of oil.   I drove back and told the hostess my issues with the wings. She proceeded to state that they WERE sauced, but the mild and medium sauces were more of a buttery sauce. Now mind you, I fry food on a regular basis, and am a huge fan of wings. The oil at the bottom of my container had not even a small amount of vinegar or spice. I didn't want to argue in the middle of a crowded place. So I just ate my pride and asked for my order to be replaced with hot buffalo. A few minutes later she brought back my order, which were the original grease soaked wings re tossed in a mildly spicy excuse for buffalo sauce.   Now I sit, wallowing in the misery of a disappointing, over priced meal. On a whole I still love Hooters, but on this occasion I would have been better off picking up some wings from the wing bar at Albertsons down the street. I definitely don't recommend spending your money at this particular location."}
{"text":"The waitress are not hot at all...and honestly i think they can think of better outfit than orange boyshorts and skin color stockings.  Food is just like other sports bars. Not a fan of the wings"}
{"text":"I went to Hooters in FLA when they first opened and thought they had the best chicken wings ever. Unfortunately, ever since they became really popular, I haven't been able to repeat that experience in the ensuing 15 years and 30+ states. I have to preface this review by stating that I'm wicked fussy about my chicken.  The wings aren't awful, but they are not the best either. They were moist, but the coating was somewhat hard in places and there were rubbery tendons inside (like a rubber band between your teeth). I have NEVER had wings that still had the \"tips\" attached and these did along with a few quills broken off inside them. The service was OK and the food came quickly. Chik-A-Fil, Popeyes or good ol' KFC is a bit better though."}
{"text":"We went there to get some good chicken wings and the big problem was that they were cold! I have had better chicken wings in other Hooters."}
{"text":"Working in the area I needed a fairly quick and flavorful meal. I remembered driving past the casino and knew they had restaurants inside. I called in my order and was able to walk right in and pick it up. This was a great convenience for me given I only get so much time for lunch.   The food was fresh and full of flavor. Really made having to work a double a little better. I ate half my order when I got it and the rest of the wings later in the day. I didn't even need to hear them up, they tasted great cold as well.   Definitely met my need for a wing fix!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Hooters ever. Sat down for over 20 minutes never greeted. No water. 2 tables came in after us and got their drinks. Asked for a manager an hour passed and no one came. Orders were all messed up. Food was cold. Asked for the manager a second time and he finally came. He said he will give a discount but still sent the same waitress over. Has been 7 minutes so far and she hasn't brought the water"}
{"text":"I stopped bye Hooters in Concord, NC for lunch. My order of burger sliders came out a little slow (because they are packed) but they were well worth the wait. Be sure and ask for Kristie if you want the best service and the friendliest server--she even posed for a photo. There are sports broadcasts on all of the TV's so come out and route for your team or driv"}
{"text":"On nights when there is a big game, this place gets too packed to handle.  On top of that, they make it open seating when its that busy so finding service and somewhere to fit is very difficult.    On other days, with less foot traffic, service is always efficient and available.  I always have the buffalo chicken sandwich which never fails to satisfy my bar food craving."}
{"text":"Never been to ANY Hooters, and decided to check it out one day while at a conference.  The 2012 Calendar on the bar read \"I'm a cheap date.  Only 9.99\"  Um, nice.  The way that I read it was that a dude can flip through the calendar and...you know!  Did you get that impression, too?  While some of the faces were okay, I thought that Hooters girls were supposed to give you body?  Not a one, let me tell ya.  To boot, they weren't smiley, or even remotely gave a shit.    My to-go order took twenty minutes.  And I only ended eating up half of it because I thought that overall it was gross.  I certainly wouldn't go back.  Unless it was just for drinks."}
{"text":"I visited this location for a going away party. Was I impressed so greatly that I want to eat here every day for the rest of my life? Heck no. Its a Hooters. If I wanted to be impressed, I would have gone to the Wynn. I came here for fun. I did leave with a full belly and I had a great time.   The food: Fresh. My salad was cold and my wings were hot. Those are my expectations for a Hooters :) This place isnt exactly for foodies... Keep your expectation level slightly above McDonalds and you will leave happy!  Drinks: Cold beer.  The Waitstaff: Attractive & Friendly.  TVs: Plenty of them all around.   Why only 4-stars? Bathroom was NASTY. I honestly dont think it is possible that it was cleaned within the week."}
{"text":"Hooters!     Where?  Well kids I have never been to Hooters. Then again, I have never been to Red Lobster either. I do have to say that food wise, I was not disappointed at allllll.   The only down fall was the \"Hooters.\" I had visualized huge knockers. I mean they are nice. They do have a variety. (we can't win them all can we) I rapidly moved on from my minor disappointment.  My brain works autonomously but as soon the waitress offered the special. I went for it.   The special which is 10 boneless wings and their world famous curly fries.  It wasn't that long of a wait. As soon as they arrived at the table I imagined my self like a vulture.  Savaging at those boneless moist and delicious, Chipotle honey wings. With a perfect side of Ranch, and don't forget my refreshing beverage.   I don't like to exaggerate but I probably crossed that line already, this places is really good.   Also as soon as you walk in you get greeted my an older gentleman walking around just being friendly. This place is pretty clean everything is made of wood.   Open 24/7   :)"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER and that is not an exaggeration. Were seated, asked where our waitress was after 20 minutes. Host then got us waters and said our waitress was talking with the manager and will be with us soon. Keep in mind, more than HALF THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!! 10 minutes later we put in our beer and food order. 15 minutes later we were served the beers after having to make eye contact with Ciara (because she was too distracted talking to co-workers.) The food took forever to get to us and what do ya know? THE ORDER WAS WRONG. Asked for no meat on the nachos and there was meat so we had to wait longer. She completely forgot about the salad and said no worries I'll fix it... Well no kidding, am I suppose to go and fix your error?! 2 hours into this and we have the correct food and really just want to leave. Were told the nacho were going to be taken care of because of the mess up.. No, the receipts (all 4 for whatever reason) were all messed up. At this point, we asked for a manager and then had to wait about 10 minutes because he was no where to be found. After getting he charges fixed we sat for nearly 20 more minutes waiting to pay our tab. We took the tab to the bar where they said we couldn't pay there! Literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in the 30 years I've been alive. Worst waitress. Don't waste your time unless you want to be pissed the hell off.   Checked my bank statement today, 2 days after this happened, to find out the server ADDED an $8 tip! Absolutely outraged."}
{"text":"Service is good, kids eat free on Saturdays. Be forewarned: if you see the Raiders group there, go someplace else. They're drunken animals and they are abusive to the staff and each other. Other that, great place!"}
{"text":"Driving through Concord NC, thought I would grab some lunch.   This is one of the newer interior Hooters with the new logo.   No milk available here. Settled for Mt Dew. (General manager did offer to go and get some milk if I really wanted it).  Decided on a Club Sandwich with a side of baked beans......     whooooa hold on sailor!  No beans at this Hooters. Discontinued 2 years ago.    What?  I though she was kidding!  Brittany T was the nicest Hooters Girl I encountered in a long time. Actually had a great conversation with her and the general manager.   The club sandwich was great!  I didn't order any other side because I was set on beans for some reason.    This is an above average Hooters in all respects!  Good food and great people and service.   (Only thing that I wish they still had was the sports section of the paper hanging in the bathroom.   Keep it up!  Will stop by again on all trips through Concord."}
{"text":"I and 12 other friends that are in the same type of industry, came in at 5pm, which normally would be prime time, at a sports bar. Upon entering, the first thing we noticed was how empty the entire place was. We discussed how incompetent the service probably was. We decided, against our better judgement, to give the place a second chance. We ordered drinks and it seemed like a lifetime before they were served! There were a few drinks that were served that were not what was ordered, the rest of the drinks were room temperature!!! Now, once the drinks is were finally straightened out... we ordered some appetizers... those were on point! The only reason I gave them a single star...(We should've stopped there!) We proceeded to order dinner... 13 meals... every single meals was a debacle! A medium well burger was literally RAW! The wings were ice cold as were the fries... the boneless wings were nothing but cut up chicken breasts with hot sauce over them! Our entire party was extremely dissatisfied with the service.  Here is the the kicker... I and my party belong to the VFW which were attending a convention here in Scottsdale... hundreds of veterans and their families that I am sure pumped thousands of dollars into this city. For an upscale city, Hooters is an absolute disgrace!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends with high expectations. Our server was this gorgeous girl named Brittany. She was the most beautiful red head girl I've ever layer eyes on. Anyway, I digress. The service was absolutely amazing, I've never had better service in my life. She was on top of everything! Our food was out quickly, my drinks never where empty, and our experience was just incredible. To anyone who has had bad service, you need to request Brittany to be your waitress, she's a Hoot!"}
{"text":"Food and staff were equally terrible. Went for all you can eat promotion and was unable to eat all that I could because of extreme periods of wait time between orders. Staff members stood around staring aimlessly and being unproductive. To say that Helen Keller would have been a better server than Janet would not be a stretch. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once so take it for what's it's worth. It was a Sunday afternoon during football season... They had 4 waitresses for the whole restaurant. We waited 10 mins for our waitress to get our drink orders. Then it took another 10 mins to get our pitcher of beer and she didn't pour our beers for us... She dropped off the pitcher and mugs and walked away. We finally ordered after we flagged her down and she came back twice to confirm our order of wings that she already wrote down. We waited over 30 mins for our wings and on our second pitcher of beer, she bought only 2 mugs for 3 of us. We saw 2 different groups of people sit down, wait 10-15 mins, and get up and leave after no one came to take their order. Our order did come out hot and correct so there was obviously some kind of shortage that day but our waitress never mentioned anything about it. Terrible service and subpar \"talent\" for Hooters.... And I've been to 15-20 Hooters from San Francisco to Wilmington, NC"}
{"text":"Stayed across the street for the Belk Bowl thought we would grab a few drinks & food before the game.  place was not that busy when we 1st got there,, we had ordered & received our wings we order before 1/2 of us had our beers, they forgot our order of shrimp, they were our of 5 different beers my buddy tried to order waitress while nice didn't seem to have a clue. Manager inquired how we were doing at which point he seemed to apologize but still took another 15 mins for my buddy to get his beer & for them to finally bring out the bbq shrimp... I'd skip this place for now."}
{"text":"Might be the worst Hooters ever! Came in on a Monday night and the restaurant was extremely empty we thought \"Great we can sit, eat and be out of here quickly\"... an hour later our food still had not been served. The waitress was at the bar chatting away and was not even concerned about our table, refills or getting us our food. Manager was great after we complained prior to leaving without eating anything at the restaurant. Save yourself the waisted time and go to Hooters on the strip."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was not what I've come to expect from a Hooters restaurant, at least not the night I went. It wasn't terrible, but it just wasn't up to the standard I've seen at other Hooters restaurants.   Nobody greeted me at the door, but at most Hooters restaurants I'm used to two or three cheerful ladies welcoming me in and suggesting great places to sit and see whatever game is on. After seating myself my friendly, but clearly distracted waitress came up to tell me about the special and take my drink order. I said she was friendly, and she would have been just fine in a regular \"family dining\" establishment, but she didn't make any efforts to engage me. In every other Hooters I've been to, the waitress will do things like sit down, ask me how I am, etc. It's those little extras that make Hooters a fun place for guys to go to. My order came out fairly promptly and the poutine was good. The boneless wings weren't breaded quite right. Hooters breading should be thin, light, and crispy and the chicken tender and juicy. This was, in most places, thick, hard and crunchy and the chicken was a little bit overcooked. The difference may be subtle, but it is important. They weren't bad, so I didn't send them back or anything, they just weren't quite right. I had my meal and three beers over the course of about an hour to an hour and a half. At both opportunities for refills on my beer, I sat for a long time before the waitress noticed that I was empty. Again, not a huge deal, but most Hooters waitresses I've had the pleasure of ordering from are very conscientious about refills, offering more before you've even finished what's in your glass. I can't honestly say she was a bad waitress, she got the job done, but she spent most of the time I was there either somewhere on the other side of the restaurant (as in, I couldn't find her when I stuck my head up to look for her because my beer was empty) or chatting with the guys at one table. I feel a little bad because I did not tip her well, but I really didn't feel like she earned more than a basic tip.  So all in all, it wasn't a *bad* experience, but it fell short in enough areas that I wish I had decided to spend my evening somewhere else."}
{"text":"The restaurant hosted a large group gracefully. The staff made every effort to keep our glasses full and our food coming quick."}
{"text":"Marcus is a great manager. We all deal with customer service issues at times. Marcus replaced my order no issues and made it great. Thank you, GREAT MANAGER!!!"}
{"text":"I like coming to this location for the UFC fights I generally stay a few hours eat and have a few drinks and enjoy myself. Service is generally good. Few complaints is that Hooters menu is a little limited if you aren't in the mood for burgers and wings but both are pretty good and the fish and chips are always a favorite. The drinks are always a little pricey. I ordered a double Jack Daniels to the tune of about 9 bucks when bottles of jack are around 20. But when the fights are free I don't mind spending a few extra bucks so I don't have to buy the pay per view at home."}
{"text":"Service ( bartender did not look happy and does not care about her guests) sucks at the bar, ac is loud, valet parking was rushing me when we pulled in, carpet was dirty, sink made a loud noise after you turned of the water."}
{"text":"They have new girls, bartender is cute and Elizabeth... is hotty....  To be honest I really enjoy the Wings...and every time I go, my table is available."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.  Eating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.  My only \"complaint\" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \"less important\" then maybe the dine in patrons."}
{"text":"I finally found someone who would go to Hooters with me.  Yeah, I said it.  We sat down in a low table and scoped out the TVs.  Me?  There to see the Big 10 championship of course.  I asked our nice waitress once.  Twice.  Couldn't find a manager.  Asked again.  Got a new waitress, Brie.  Asked Brie.  She went in search of the elusive remote.  Like a rock star, Brie climbed up to the HD monolith and changed it herself.  Big kudos to this little lady.  And a big tip.  Steamed Shrimp wasn't as fresh as I've had before but the loaded tots were DELISH.  Some may find it odd that I get shrimp at Hooters, but I alsways. do.  My male companion's boneless wings were yummy too.  Crispy and juicy.  I won't be back to this Hooters but I'll continue to patronage when I can convince someone to go with me."}
{"text":"If you're craving some wings, this is a good option. I didn't come here often when I lived in Vegas, but when I did, I really enjoyed the food. The Hooter's restaurant is on the ground floor of the Hooter's Casino toward the far back.  I always try to come when it wasn't rush hour so I am usually seated immediately. There are two sides of the restaurant, one for adults 21 and older and then the family side. I have been seated on both sides, but prefer the family side as it's more open and has a lot more light. I don't like eating in the dark!  Food is good here, probably the best thing about this location. I've had the wings, chicken sandwich, fried pickles and curly fries. All delicious. Food usually comes out quickly. The girls that work there are your average Hooter girls. Skinny and boobs. Most don't have a personality, they just do their job and that's all. Some will smile, some will make conversation, but it seems like the girls are nicer to the people they think will leave them a bigger tip.   Would come back again, but just for the food. Everything else is just average at best."}
{"text":"Good convenient location with great food and nice service.   The girls that work here are always pleasant and ready to serve you. I'm seated immediately as I usually come during non-busy hours and my waitress comes quickly and takes my drink and food order.   I usually get fried pickles or onion rings as an appetizer and wings or the Buffalo Chicken sandwich for my main meal. Food comes out quickly, is hot and fresh, and tastes delicious. If you want Ranch with your wings, it's an extra cost. I don't remember always having to pay for Ranch, but oh well. I just eat mine without now and they are still good.   When I come to Hooters, I usually ask to sit outside. There is plenty of seating both indoors, at the bar, and outside.   The men's restroom has been clean and stocked the times that I've been here. No complaints there.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"stopped here for a late night snack. ordered the slider burgers. the waitress asked me how i'd like them cooked, and i replied \"medium rare.\" shortly, i was brought over 4 sliders that were the size of meatballs. they were all medium well to well done and they were served dry. yes, they brought me 4 pieces of overcooked meat on buns. nothing else. when i complained about it, the manager came over and informed me that was the only way to cook sliders, since they are so small, you can't make them medium rare. perhaps he thought i'd never ordered sliders before, or maybe he thought i've never cooked sliders before, but i've eaten dozens of them medium rare.  they were nice enough to take the sliders off my bill, but i still left hungry. the waitress was very nice about everything, though."}
{"text":"I don't know, I think they read reviews...  Since my last review I gave them a chance, TWICE. They've turned their service around, food is hot, comes out fast and accurate. Thank you for changing your ways. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Used to enjoy watching games here.  Apparently the possibility exists you may die of hunger or thirst.  I watched a whole quarter before they noticed me.   Grimaldi's here I come..."}
{"text":"I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!"}
{"text":"Every time I order takeout or delivery my order is WRONG OR MISSING ITEMS! Items that I have to pay extra for EVERY F***ING TIME  COME ON  it's not that hard to put an order consisting of four items together!!  Wings, drink, extra sauce, celery ARE YOU KIDDING ME  GET IT TOGETHER"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend, only because I had a coupon. The service was descent but the food was mediocre. The wings tasted like the ones you buy in the grocery store. 24 bucks for a 20 piece. I wasn't impressed. The lemon pepper tasted better then the Asian flavor though. I'll be sticking to wingstop and Buffalo Wild Wings next time. The bill would have been almost 40 bucks for a 20 piece wing, fries and 1 drink. Thank god for the 10 dollar off coupon."}
{"text":"I have been going to hooters for years went to the hooters in the palms my friends took me there for my birthday got lousy service all the waitress was doing was hanging out with some guy in the corner when we wanted to get more stuff took waitress for ever to come out  they raised the prices very high don't think me or my friends will be going back to hooters we spend over 200.00 dollars there was not worth it"}
{"text":"Hooters is a difficult restaurant to describe without mentioning the state of the entire franchise. The concept of serving cold beer and tasty wings by young women has been successfully copied by several \"breastarant-type\" chains. Hooters was one of the first, if not THE first to use the formula. Rumor has it that the idea started by some guys sitting in a bar in Clearwater, Florida. Well anyways, you know that Hooters are marketed to guys that like sports, wings, beer and attractive women.  That being said, you would think that now more than ever, Hooters would have improved on their operation just to meet the competition. We live near West Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale. Either of these two locations used to (note: past tense) set the gold standard for service, food and real fun. Fifteen years ago, you could go to just about any Hooters in Florida and enjoy some great food and drinks while being entertained by some ridiculously attractive and engaging waitresses. You WANTED to go back! That atmosphere has sharply declined, and it's hard to say exactly why.  During my recent trip to Charlotte, we visited a Hooters location before a basketball game. At first, I thought the atmosphere problem might be just a South Florida issue because we were greeted very enthusiastically the moment we walked in by several Hooters girls. With over two hours to kill before tip-off, we sat at the bar. And that's where the \"wheels fell off the wagon.\" A gratuitous smile followed by a sharp demand for ID's. That's OK, I am over 50, and my husband is over 60. I was not insulted, but honey...use a hint of politeness when speaking to a paying customer. The next thing I noticed is that the menus could stand some wiping down. The food is greasy, I understand that, but some 409 can cure that issue. To condense the experience, our salad and wings came out within a reasonable amount of time and were good. However, my husband's fries were not hot at all. He never said a word, but one of the bartender's noticed that he was not eating them and inquired about that. He said that they were not too good....kind of cold. Service 101...when something does not meet the customer's expectation, make it right on the spot, or take it off the bill. Doing neither is just poor judgement or training.  I think that this Hooters location is ideal in the downtown area of Charlotte. I would assume that they get a load of business from nearby hotels to really worry about business falling off. I can't get upset with the managers or servers because I have seen this exact type of deterioration at other Hooters locations in Florida. Yelp does not provide \"half star\" rating increments or I would have split my rating straight down the middle to a 2 1/2-stars instead of just two."}
{"text":"5 Stars, I can't say they have the best food in town or any good food.  Some people rave about their wings....really...seriously!?  Anyways.....  However, this location does get 5 stars for one reason -- Service!  They were very gracious in accommodating my large party.  Especially, on a free UFC fight night like they have!  Yes, free UFC here!  They went above and beyond what they had to do and they my friends; that's an A+ regardless of their food -- I'll eat your wings because you're awesome!  The place wasn't packed and I was sitting alone at my table.  I told the manager my group is coming I swear, but when he told me it doesn't matter as long as I'm happy -- you damn right I'm happy; hit me with another pint!  Their staff overall was very friendly and accommodating, but maybe it's for better tips.  In the end, it didn't matter thanks for the smile and great service!  The girls here are pretty sexy, but I must say I think overall Hooters need to change up their outfit.  I dig the signature white tee, orange daisy dukes, and ankle high socks, but I didn't grow up in the 70's!  Need to revamp the outfit and menu I think, but hey with service and free UFC fights -- I'll keep coming back! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible!!!! No greeting! Skipped over! Management has no skills in restaurant business. Downtown Phoenix....good. Hooters...not good. For the past two years service has been horrible. Still hasn't gotten any better! Hooters doesn't care!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this particular location last night and me and 7 friends went for one of our friends 21st birthday. There was a guy (who I presume was a manager) that was sitting at the table behind us. All of the servers and hostesses neglected their table to sit around this guy and talk. My drink was not refilled the whole time we were there and when another guest joined our table it took close to 20 mins for him to be served. Worst service I have ever experienced and I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Crab legs are a little skimpy as far as what Ive had at other hooters through out the country. I was in three days in a row, 2 of which I ordered the same two items both days and had the same server. Crab legs and 6 piece wings. I eat out a lot because I travel constantly on business trips. I look for consistency, especially when it comes to customer service. And I don't mean simply a friendly server. I am a HUGE fan of Hooters, since '85! Three key points: with crab legs you usually get the small fork and a shell cracker with wings and crab legs you usually get wet naps. (Without having to ask for them). Tuesday I got them. Wednesday not so much. I had to ask for replacement paper towels, (ran out) and wet naps didn't bother asking for the small fork. I ordered the key lime pie and when the server (different person) brought the pie she said \"you order this?\" While looking at my table and seeing no fork asked me \"do you need a fork?\" Cmon?  And the pie was frozen. Smh.  I ate here 3 days straight. Day 1 sat at the bar and had Cameron as a server. She was great. Days 2 & 3. Not great. Sadly they will not pay any attention to this but felt the need to tell it how it was..."}
{"text":"Usually one of the better hooters, however today we didn't have the best experience. My cousin and I sat down around 2pm and placed our order immediately after the waitress brought us our drinks. He ordered wings and fries and I ordered a quesadilla. We ended up not getting our food until 45-50 minutes later and even then the fries weren't ready. I had to ask for the check as I received the food because we had somewhere to be.  It wasn't even busy so we were definitely disappointed. The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?  Also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.  I don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.  Your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you."}
{"text":"Went back again, music was just right not too loud. Great place had the cajun wings naked and grilled. Pretty damn good ! The beer is always cold here and the VIEW is awesomerrrr."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for some food and drinks on the weekend. They said they ran out of tequila but out margaritas made it out anyway? And our food took at least 20 minutes to come out. It was warm at best. My boneless wings were pathetic but at least my boyfriends quesadillas were hot. The waitresses took selfies and multiple shots while we were waiting for our food. First time at Hooters. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Porky's Revenge hot dog w chili and jalepenos, curly fries. It arrived, cold dog and cold chili. The fries were warm - not fresh/hot. Sent it back. It came back cold fries and warmed from an oven visit for a few minutes at best. Now the bread is toast, the dog is warm... Not fresh grilled and the chili which was col is now body temp.  What can I expect from \"Hooters\" anyway... Should've gone to Outback."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Hooters with my friend and both experiences were different. I was actually unpleased with my experience this time and decided to make a review about it.   My friend and I came to Hooters on Sunday and it was dead as it was Victoria Day weekend. We had a very nice server, but it seemed like she spent more time with her other tables than she did with us. I think it's because we didn't order any alcoholic drinks and not to mention, those other tables were all men.   My friend and I ordered the Lots-A-Tots, creamy garlic wings and ribs and wings. The food was fine, but my friend complained about her stomach hurting the next day, but I was fine. But I'm not here to complain about the food, but more about the service and time it took to get our food and bill.   We had to wait about 30 minutes before we got any of our food and there was a table behind us that got their food way before ours. I didn't really understand how that was possible... Also, our server barely checked up on us. When it was time to leave, I walked up to her (since we couldn't really get her attention as she was always at her other tables) and asked her for the bill. It wasn't until another 15 minutes till we actually got the bill. I understand you'll make more tips off those other tables with guys buying drinks, but make sure to check up on your other tables as well. This service was poor and was very different from our previous experience."}
{"text":"Well they don't open till after 10 on a Sunday and games not even on. Seems to be no rush around here. Then they say they are gonna get them on. How sad. Not a sports bar. Just a overpriced joke."}
{"text":"Bewbs, drinks and wings!   Best combo, yeah?  Late night grub with our last drinks usually ends up here. Gambling and losing, but that's ok, 90s music is playing and the nostalgia feeling overcomes your loss.  Never win... EVER. But, the wings are always a winner though. Add some curly fries, which for some reason is always soggy, and some fried pickles for that sour kick.   My friend threw up in the parking lot once and lost his brand new phone. I'll spare the details though, but that shows that you can have a wonderful drunken night at hooters!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Hooters for lunch!...no pun intended! Kiya greeted me at the bar and was quick to upsell me on the Big beer which was a no-brainer? for only $1.50 more. I placed my order and the wings and fries came out rather quickly?, not many other people in there at 2 on a Tuesday, though. Kiya, was a great bartender and wasn't overbearing and provided the perfect amount of attention to? me.   Overall, I would go back and probably try the boneless bites. I had one sneak onto my wing order and it was really good!"}
{"text":"BEST DOS EQUIS! The beer is served ice cold with a lime. I literally go there for that. The food is awesome. Buffalo shrimp are the tits. No pun intended. They have deals on unlimited wings and they have multiple different sauce flavors. The staff is nice, and their food is awesome. #BBB (boobs, butts, and beer)"}
{"text":"We went there to watch my COWBOYS play the Eagles for the 3rd time last season so it was a great day. Now the food was good. We knew the calorie content was high having just moved from San Diego where they are legally required to list the calorie content right on the menu. LOVE THAT! and we told the waitress we were sharing a wrap with curly fries. It was delish. I'd order it again. She came back to ck on us the appropriate amt of times. not to fussy. a few beers - close to my house, great night."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service.  We have been there 3 times thinking maybe the first one/two were flukes. Nope.  Every time we went we sat at the bar with no one even greeting us for at least 10min.  The first time I tried to sit at an empty seat to gamble and they told me they were saving it for someone coming in later.  Um, what?!  We had to stand after that and eventually left bc we couldn't get service and couldn't sit at the bar bc 3 chairs were being \"saved\" for ppl.  The second time, we ordered drinks and shots... got our drinks, no shots.  We reminded her about our shots when we finally saw her again.... still didn't bring them to us.  Finally, after the third time asking for our shots, she brought them to us. The third time, we went for the fight and again they had the bar seats \"saved\" for ppl coming in later. We ordered beers and got them about 20min later.  We closed our tab and left.  We will never be back.  Sad that this could be a nice place considering they have the fights/games and outdoor seating.  But the horrid customer service is what kills it."}
{"text":"I'm going to go with three stars instead of four for this location because nothing stands out.  The waitresses are nice enough, but sometimes they don't come around as often as they should.  I've been to a lot of Hooters over the years, and I know the difference between good and great.  They are just good.  The layout is pretty nice and the food is also good but not great.  This location is extremely family friendly, as I brought my girlfriend and her kids to eat there.  One of her kids who NEVER eats anywhere absolutely LOVES the hotdog.  So much so that she asks to go eat there everytime I am in town.  Although I only went with three stars, I'll gladly be a regular."}
{"text":"Everyone knows what to expect when they go into a Hooters.  Visiting from L.A. after being at the Cards/Rams game that day, I went in to watch the Sunday night game and have a little dinner.  I was pleasantly surprised by someone who waited on me.  But not in the way you may think.  My waitress was Chyra. A nice person and very attentive.  She had a few recommendations on the menu and always had my drink filled.  As I ate and watched the game, she continually asked if I was good, which I appreciated.  I had noticed some of, though not all, the other girls that were working were just standing around talking to each other.  Some to the same customers for long periods of time.  In fact, I did see a couple walk in, were seated in the back and after a certain amount of time of neglect, they walked out.  I was very disappointed in seeing this.  Not saying it was intentional, but bothersome just the same.  While some girls were standing around, I noticed Chyra continually working and staying busy, not just serving customers but cleaning tables, stocking, checking things and whatever it takes to justify having a job.  You could tell this young girl has a good work ethic and it was great to see.  I would hope that this review is seen by management and she is considered for advancement.  My shrimp po boy was pretty good, as was the cheesecake Chyra recommended. Keep up the good work.    Good place to catch some sports. But debatable on whether I would return."}
{"text":"(  o  ) (  o  )    Boobies = cool.   Hooters = stupid crappy place.     Food sucks. Chicks are stupid. Having some cleavage showing does not give them a free pass when it comes to poor service.   I didn't pick this place, a buddy of mine did.  That bastard, I might not talk to him anymore.  I never understood the pantyhose with the shorts, what no talent ass clown in upper management came up with that brilliant marketing ploy?"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a 0 I would. Horrible service all around. Our waitress disappeared for a while and then resurface about 15 minutes later every time. Our orders would come out inconsistently and the food was cold. She forgot one of our orders of fries. When we ordered a second round of wings for all you can eat, they brought out four orders all together. Their garlic Parmesan wings were super salty, that we were unable to read them. I would have asked for a manager but there was no staff around and I honestly just wanted to get out of there. Terrible service, won't go back."}
{"text":"The food is aweful, the service stinks and really the overall atmosphere blows. Hooters was cool 20 years ago, but they should switch it up with a complete overhaul"}
{"text":"Waitress never brought my drink. Brought me water instead. Then when I told her I didn't want to pay for a drink I didn't get she got her manager and he told me he would have to pull the video footage and then fire her if she indeed didn't. Totally ridiculous response to such a small issues. The waitress didn't deserve to loose her job, I didn't deserve to pay for the drink, and I for sure wasn't waiting for him to pull footage. Either way it was a bad experience with bad food and service in general"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great but the tables near the outdoor area were all sticky and dirty."}
{"text":"Worst Hooters I have ever been too. Terribly slow service, ordered all you can eat wings on a Monday night and it took them about 30 minutes to initially bring my food out. When I received my order I asked for a second order and it took about the same amount of time. She even told us it only takes about 6 to 10 minutes to cook the wings. The service was slow and they had maybe 7 others in the restaurant. I will never go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"The bartender is so incredibly rude. I waited an hour for takeout and instead of apologizing or giving me an eta she told me 'I literally have 20 orders so I don't know what you want'. No smile. No offer of water. No offer to validate parking. She's just too good for me. It's rare service is this poor."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if they let me.  Hooters was established as a sports bar.  The casino in Vegas is now a preppy bar that only plays music videos.  Could not even watch the nba playoffs   Stay away like it has the plague.   Horrible slot olds and not sports.  Lot of better places Togo in Vegas"}
{"text":"10 am brunch on a Wednesday?  There weren't many places open so I end d up at Hooters.  This was actually my first time in a Hooters and I was pleasantly surprised.  My server Breea was fantastic.  She took the time to explain to her favorites on the menu: fried pickles and the new smoked wings.   I loved the smoked wings - they use a real smoker machine (rather than smoke flavor) and the meat was tender and juicy.  100% delicious.  The fried pickles were a bit soggy and didn't have enough \"bite\".  The -1 star is for cleanliness.  The first TWO tables I sat at were visibly dirty and the server was embraced by it.  The menus were fairly beat up."}
{"text":"Zero ass stars.  Learn some decent respect to customers.  I walked out hungry. I do not need some yelling at me across from the bar to pay my bill when i going to the bathroom. \"bc (you) have sections and have to keep the bills separate\"  I dont need someone to tell me \"get out of the way\" while I am taking my coat off.  or even \"can u just wait over there\"  Train your staff to be decent human beings with some manners for fuck sake.  By the fucking way, my vodka soda was just flat fucking soda."}
{"text":"I'm a really big sucker for Hooters wings.  Daytona (breaded!!), 3 mile island, spicy garlic; it's all pretty damn amazing to me.  Problem is; there just seems to be something wrong with the food here.  The few times that I've been, the chicken tasted very gamey and the consistency felt almost microwaved or something.  I can't really put my finger on it, but there's just something off about the taste here.  My girlfriend feels that they're just using really low quality chicken.  I wouldn't be inclined to disagree.   Still better than the one at the Palms imo"}
{"text":"For me, the problem with this Hooters is that it doesn't feel like a Hooters.  The open set up that allows you to see the casino around you makes for a very different ambiance. While sitting in this Hooters, I had the feeling of sitting in the middle of the casino floor.  The Palms feels like a morgue as is.  Attempting a Hooters amidst the dimly lit, mostly empty Palms casino floor that's taken up almost entirely by golden aged cigarette smokers was brave; and not very well thought out.    I had no problems with the service; although I've had a recurring issue with Hooters in Vegas (this one as well as the one on Trop).  The chicken always seems very gamey. I've never had this problem at any Hooters in any part of the world; but nearly every time I've been to one of these two Hooters, the odd gamey taste of the chicken overpowers even the strongest of sauces.  My girlfriend agreed that they seem to be using the lowest quality chicken imaginable."}
{"text":"Hooter Hooter Hooters hooters hooters. Hoot hoot hoot. Lots of hooters here you know the owls. Hooters Hooters Hooters"}
{"text":"Wednesday is Wingsday!!! All you can eat $12.99 And my server was the best! Crystal was so attentive, friendly, and kept are drinks topped off. I'm good w that. See ya next week Crystal!"}
{"text":"I had never visited a Hooters until about 4 years ago. Mainly I hadn't been in one because I was turned off by the whole concept of the establishment. I have to give it props however, because this is the place where I tried my very first fried pickle.  Their fried pickles are chip cut. I like to get mine extra crispy (meaning they double fry/ batter them).  This was actually suggested to me by one of the waitresses that served me at this location.  They also get props because they serve their fried pickles with a fabulous sauce.  It's a delicious zesty ranch sauce and I hear supposedly it is just hooters hot sauce and ranch dressing.  The ultimate bonus comes in when you hit them up for Happy Hour; then it's only $2.50 for a whole order of them!  Overall, I feel as though Hooters is a-ok now. Maybe because they allowed me to discover one of my true loves.  In all honesty though, I like this location on a Sunday afternoon outside on the balcony overlooking Mill Ave. Throw back a beer, people watch and stare at the pigeons that often visit (including ones with only 2 toes)."}
{"text":"The only positive about this experience was that the wings were pretty good although we went for the all you can eat we weren't allowed due to the restaurant only being open for a week... the service was extremely slow, I also asked for water 4 times before they brought it as we were leaving. We waited for about an hour for the wings and they almost gave them to a different table. Would not recommend there are definitely better wing places in mtl."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my kids today for lunch wasn't very impressed by the cleanliness of the booths we sat in. It was pretty dead inside so you would think that the waitress Would-be more than attentive and refilling drinks are but that didn't happen. My kids had the sliders to beef and to chicken Buffalo which they were pretty small Then another one of my kids had the bacon Texas melt Burger which he said was pretty good. We had a fried pickles for an appetizer those were amazing cooked absently to perfection And the dipping sauce was awesome. Over all disappointed in the cleanliness of this location and for not being busy the waitress not coming around as much. I worked for hooters myself many years ago for over 5 years so needless to say Was very unimpressed with this location."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place always smells like the sewer is backed up...the bar counter is always dirty!  & the bartenders are not nice or friendly."}
{"text":"I believe I had this older woman who I believe is the manager of Hooters and she come up to me and told me how was my food and I did tell her that my chicken wings Had  a lot of breading on it and she said OK and just walked  away from me and never even wanted to give me some new wings and the french fries had 10 pounds of salt on it and she didn't even care and she's a manager ??? She just walked away from me , so as a senior advisor , I review this restaurant way below one star. The only one I would get five stars to is the  waitress Gabriele No way will I come back here again. Now she can go walk away from her job"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've had bad experiences here and so-so experiences here, but it's a solid place. I think Hooters in general is way overpriced, but this particular location is in a perfect spot in Uptown. The layout of the restaurant and bar has a good, open feel to it. The service is hit or miss, but that's not unusual for a lot of places in Uptown.  The one thing that really bothers me is how they have the smoking setup outside. Having smokers at the door really ruins the restaurant's curb appeal. Also, we were sitting well inside on my last visit, but the smell of smoke coming in the restaurant from just three smokers in front was overwhelming. Why can't they have smokers outside the back of the restaurant like Tilt (which is next door) does?"}
{"text":"We had not been to a Hooters since moving here from South Carolina and I just couldn't help it any longer. I love Hooters wings and so my family and I gave the Hooters in Spring Valley a try. It was definitely worth it. The food was great and the wings were even better than I remember. The service was good, but not great. But, overall it was a good experience. 4 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"They are closed now. :("}
{"text":"I'm shocked this Hooters has such low reviews, We come mostly after games and this time  we visted the Friday afternoon after that glorious Eagles win on Thursday night at the Panther's stadium.  I will agree the service could be a little more attentive from the waitresses towards couples and families, but I GET it , isn't the whole meaning of being a Hooters girl is to sit and talk a little more with the interested customers ? As long as my drinks were filled , my food hot, my wings crispy, my  order  correct, and my service pleasant I'm leaving as a content customer.   Love that they have naked wings , you can order all drums and get all drums unlike other places , and watch the games, kinda hard to mess that up ."}
{"text":"I Used to go often on Wed for their special but stopped due to product changing. Since Buffalo Wild Wings opened next door it's been goin down hill. The wings are super small now and they have increased the price of their specials twice now. The servers are great but the food has made me not wanna go back ever again."}
{"text":"The outdoor second-level deck at this Hooters is a surprisingly nice place to sit with a cold beer. There are plenty of TVs, and the girls were attentive but not intentionally overbearing as at other Hooters. The food still sucks though."}
{"text":"The patio at this Hooters is a nice, relaxed spot to throw back a few beers during the day. There is no shortage of televised sporting events or bright orange butts, so that doesn't leave a whole lot to complain about unless you happen to order food."}
{"text":"HOOTERS IS HOOTERS... SO what else could be explained??  Not really worried/care about other people and them bringing their kids to Hooters. (My sister took my lil man so much when I took em.. everybody know HIM...talk about a humbling experience.. my son is 10yrs old... lmao)  Anyway, I usually get the same thing all the time.. (see pic) Sometimes I think they get a lilttle ahead of themselves. I like my chicken wings bones to be brown... not PINK (you may need to tell them to cook it XTRA CRISPY)  other than that, and I don't' believe they free pour. iTS not much new here.   It is what it is!!!"}
{"text":"Hello friends,   (Updated review) I've been to other Hooters, but while there I always compare them to this location. While they all are suppose to be the same. Ehhhhh, well maybe. But this is my favorite.   The ladies are nice, pretty, and cheerful (considering all the guys that must come in trying to run lame game). I always sit at the bar to the right coming in. When I come with the wife we sit at the bar, booths, or tables. When not sitting at the bar I find at times they are a little tardy at taking your order.   As for the food, I've never had any complaints. LEMON PEPPER is my favorite. Naked = Not breaded. I've had their oysters, salads, wings,  fries (curly, which are my favorite), shrimp. Never trusted them with burgers. But some reviews swear by them.    They have a lot of specials, and a updated lunch menu. They run buy 10,get 10 sometimes. All the PPV fights, MMA etc., are at no cover. Can't beat that.   Go Enjoy, TTFN"}
{"text":"Came here to grab some hooter wings and watch some march madness basketball. Service wasn't the greatest. Waitress messed up my wife's order and didn't bring out everything we ordered so we had to wait for the rest of the food by the time we were almost done eating. I understand they have to keep the Toronto sports teams on the most the TVs but it was hard to even get the March madness tournament on one. Also our medium wings in the US soooooooo much different than the wings in Canada. Just a side note"}
{"text":"Wings were a little burnt, but besides that, everything tasted fairly decent. Service was a hit or miss, our waitress seem busy. There are 2 sections, one is for 21 years old and older but they obviously don't input that rule to their policy because there were lots of kids in that area. Self seating at the bar where there are electronic poker games present. 24/7 which I like, so whenever I have the random Munchies, I can just go downstairs from the hotel and grab some wings"}
{"text":"Service 5 stars: Hannah, our server is fantastic. She always check up on us and attend right away if we need drink refills. She is friendly and really hardworking; waitressing a few tables by herself during the night owl shift. Props to her for sure! By far my favorite server here and I've been here more than 5 times.   Food quality 4 stars: I came here a few times and the first time I ordered wings, it was burnt and more boney than meaty. Typical bar food/appetizers. Nothing too special, but the food here tasted way better than the other Hooters I've been to.   Night owl special: only valid Sunday thru Thursday midnight - 8am. There are 5 items that are $9.99 each and drink menu that had 3 items.   ***Check the hotel kiosk that you can swipe your membership card to possible have a chance to win free 5 chicken wings for Hooters restaurant; one spin per day ***"}
{"text":"Walked in to have some quick appetizers before a movie. We were sat immediately which was nice being it is mother's day. We sat down no waitress came to ask for our drinks or introduce herself. We waited for about 30 minutes before I had to get up and ask another waitress to bring our waitress whom I didn't  know who it was.. still after no waitress after 20 minutes and the place was not even busy. We just got up and left. Horrible customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a quick lunch with my son. The service was good and the food was excellent. A little pricey."}
{"text":"I have been delinquent in submitting this review. Visited July 29. 2015. Keep forgetting to report my experience. Two stars...because I could not select 2 1/2 stars. Not a 3-star experience. Here's why:  PROS: Clean facility, presents a visually positive image. Excellent service, by a relatively new server (according to her), Emmy. She provided truly \"Emmy Award Winning Service!\" My suggestion to her: Keep doing exactly what you are doing. Friendly, and most importantly, good communication (about the CON, which follows below). Also great: Manager Jenny. Found out she was leaving. What a loss for Hooters. Should have given her a raise or done whatever it would have taken to keep her around. She is professional, honest, friendly...and seemed to have a good relationship with the staff.  CON: To my knowledge, Hooters was founded mostly on the premise of cooking great tasting wings with beer, which are served by scantily clad, sexy women. However, on all-you-can eat Wednesdays, there is a major problem...at least at this particular facility. The traffic was light to moderate...nothing past 1/2 - 2/3 capacity...at the absolute MOST...and only for a brief time frame of less than an hour....at the busiest part of the evening. Arrived around 7-ish, if memory serves, and stayed til about 10ish. From what our party of three learned, apparently their deep-fry equipment cannot handle heavy demand. \"Heavy demand\" apparently means a restaurant about 1/2 full at most, with most guests ordering the wing special. Re-orders were delayed well past reasonable (20 - 30 minutes at the very least). A server other than Emmy brought us a partial wing order at one point (literally 3 - 4 wings each) because we had been waiting so long...and we waited even longer for the rest of our first reorder to be cooked. When they arrived, they were barely cooked...not crisp at all. We were told that they have limited deep-fry cooking pots, and the excess demand for wings on a night like that causes more cold/frozen wings to be put in the oil, which in turn cools the oil and lengthens the cook time. The problem just spirals out of control, the busier it gets.  Bottom line: You are a restaurant and sports bar. Your main job is to provide a basic food menu. If you do not have the equipment to handle a 1/2 capacity customer load, then stop advertising \"all you can eat.\"  I hate to imagine the fiasco that would result if it had been busier. I saw AT LEAST 3 parties leaving...and was told they left because of the over-taxed wing cooking process. They simply did not want to continue waiting, and I don't blame them at all. I love Hooters. I don't go there weekly, but I have been a customer who has for more then 20 years enjoyed my visits and the wings. But given my experience this time at this location, I would have to re-evaluate whether I would really visit again..on all you can eat night. My advice: At the very least, do yourself a favor and pick a different day of the week. That way, your wings will be cooked thoroughly and you will not have to wait 30 minutes for your order to arrive.  Note that Mark G posted a similar complaint about undercooked wings on Sept 27, 2015."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE IVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE!!!! on more than one occasion this exact location (75th and thomas) has always gave not just me but the party I come with terrible terrible service. This last time was without a doubt the worst! came here to watch a soccer match the place was easily only 35-40% full we were a party of 8 or 9 wanted to have a couple TVs to watch the game. they would only change 1 TV because other people were watching the game witch is understandable   but some TVs were clearly not needed for people who had 2 or 3 OTHER tvs they can watch from the spot they were sitting in. we requested to sit in a different side of the restaurant where we were treated good by Mercy. we've been there a good 5 times and each time have had a terrible experience the only person who should be allowed to work there is Andy and Mercy both provided good service and apologized for EVERY inconvenience we had there. Hooters wings are so good but just stay away from this location they need new management!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to come and enjoy a beer or two with friends! And to see the games! Good atmosphere, the girls are always nice! And they have karaoke night on Tuesdays and wingsday on Wednesdays!! Their food isn't so bad either! Sliders are  fries are always a good appetizer"}
{"text":"I have a dirty secret.  I used to work at this Hooters.  Granted, it was about 11 years ago or so, but still, it's not the classiest place to waitress at.  I also lied about my age and they never bothered to check.  I was 18, but said I was 19 so I could serve alcohol.  What a little hooligan I was.  I used to think only men went to Hooters. I figured I would be serving pervy, creepy men all night long, but this just wasn't the case.  The weirdest thing to me about this restaurant is that both men and women go, and some even bring their children.  If men, women and children all go to Hooters, this obviously means they're not going to ogle the women in orange shorts.  They must be going (gasp) for the food.  Is this right? Do people really like the food at Hooters?? It's hard for me to believe, but I've seen these customers myself and I'm still baffled.  I ask again, do people truly go to Hooters for the food?"}
{"text":"Almost every time I decide to eat here it completely ruins my day. I can't believe I keep coming back here with all the comparable Happy Hour options in the area. Maybe because I am a college student living on a budget and the idea of getting their $6 wing special while watching sports seems too good a deal to pass up when it crosses my mind like once or twice a month. Usually, I am disappointed by my experience because the waitresses don't keep my water glass full and it takes too damn long for the kitchen to get the food out. But today definitely takes the cake for my worst experience ever at this restaurant. After sitting at the bar waiting about 30-40 minutes for my food I noticed a male employee bring food out to the gentlemen who ordered 10 minutes after I did. I was mildly fuming because it looked like he had ordered the same thing I did. When the bartender came over around to him and said \"Oh sorry I thought you had ordered bone in wings.\" And she takes his plate and as she walks by reassures me that my food is coming. Girl: I am not an idiot, I can tell that your manager brought my food out to someone else and the kitchen staff would have to start over on my order. Own up to it: Get the manager over to apologize to me and offer me some kind of discount. She never even came over to explain to me the situation and offer to make up for it herself. Soon the guy who originally got my order received the food he ordered and I was sitting there at the bar with a phone that was now out of battery, pretending to watch the NFL Network. The waitress apologized again and I asked her point blank if the other guy had been given my food. She said yes but did not offer me anything to make up for the shitty experience. And how much longer it would take to get my retired order? After going to check with the kitchen she assured me it would only be 4 minutes. I waited for 8 minutes, watching as food came flying out of the kitchen. Not my order... I then got up and left feeling completely ashamed, hungry and beyond infuriated: I was done wasting my time there."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 88/100***  This review is solely for the food, MEH is right! I have always preferred Wingstop among others but last night we were at Grimaldi's to pick up a free birthday pizza and hubby wanted wings so we decided on Hooters out of convenience since it was only two doors down. I haven't had Hooters in more than 7 years and now I remember why. Although I don't ever remember it being that bad, maybe because back then I didn't know any better since I'm really not that big into wings.  We ordered 20 pieces ($22 with tax), 10 pieces original wings with garlic parmesan sauce on the side and 10 pieces lemon pepper, comes with 2 ranch dressing. That had to be the most ordinary wings I've ever had! The original wings were tasteless and just plain boring! I decided to get the sauce on the side just in case we didn't like it (which was nasty by the way), but the original breading itself was bland, no salt and pepper detected just flour. The lemon pepper wings had little taste but it was undesirable, at least in comparison with Wingstop's lemon pepper which are pretty hard to beat.  Needless to say, I won't be back. That was the worst $20 I've spent, should have gone with my instinct and gotten Wingstop instead or just made some myself because not to toot my own horn but I make some wicked wings, according to my husband anyway ;)"}
{"text":"From the beginning while waiting to be seated we had a problem, the hostess, Jenny, didn't notice we were waiting right behind the gentleman she just sat, when she came back she sat two gentlemen that stepped in front of us, up by the cash register, first. One of the servers, Shanice, noticed and sat us promptly.   Mouth salivating, anticipating the delicious food, we ordered chili, tater tots, and boneless wings. Unfortunately, the chili came out cold, but the tots and chicken were good. The server who brought the food was nice enough, but wasn't the Hooters I remember, where each person that assisted the table would introduce themselves.   We flagged down the server and informed her that temperature of the chili seemed a little cold, notably, the cheese was not melting. She informed the manager on duty, who was very service oriented and immediately replaced the chili, but stated he would first check the temp of the pot first and bring out a fresh one if able...food safety! To my stomachs' delight, I had a nice hot cup of chili.  In closing, I would expect more out of a Hooters restaurant in the Hooters Hotel than anywhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch. It was very good service from our waitress Brenda. She was very attentive and helpful. The food was also very good, and was not pricy."}
{"text":"Great experience for the NFL DRAFT on Thursday night. Food was good, service was great!!!!!! Thank you Crystal!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in the mood for some wings 3am in the morning and want to avoid the strip or crowded Hooters Hotel, this is  the place to chill and have a very late night wings wit friends.  Fortunately I live in the southwest side of Vegas, so this location isn't really far from where I live.  This late at night you just walk in and seat yourself. There are no waitresses on shift this late at night so for the drunk pervs, sorry but you might have to get your booty shorts fix somewhere else.  The bar area is the best place to if you want to be attended to right away since its the bartender basically doing everything this late.  If you decide to sit at one of the tables, you might find yourself constantly getting up just to waive him down for simple things such as refills.  Wings here we're still the same price though so don't be fooled and think its 25 cents per wings past midnight like the one in Hooters Hotel."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place zero stars, I would. Walked in with my family and we were seated... And that's all about what happened. For 20 minutes no one bothered to come to the table to ask about our drinks or even come to the table at all. Tables around us were being served and people seated after us we're getting orders taken. So we left to the Mi Amigos nearby for much better and instant service. Family restaurant my ass. First and last time at Hooters, especially this one. Thanks for making our first time experience a horrible one."}
{"text":"Here's my story & review: I went to this Hooters back on March 19th, 2015, which is almost about one year ago. My server did NOT do the best nor greatest job of customer service (emphasizing this, as this is a key factor here). This is what happened to me, as the following occured during my servers' service of ignorance (she never once wanted to acknowledge me), during her shift:  1) She took 10-15 minutes to take my order 2) She never refilled my lemonade, so I had a different server do that for me 3) She took 5-10 minutes to get me my check  In between what my server did, she sat at a table with three to four different people, and I saw her do this at least two to four separate times. I had to get up, at least three times, just to get her attention to help me out. I did use a stopwatch to time the service, because I was getting the stiffed ignored & denied treatment from my server. At this point, the customer service was getting both ridiculous & out of hand.   I didn't like nor appreciate what this Hooters location did to their former regular customer. The story gets very interesting, hence the plot thickens, & I got kicked out three weeks later by management during a pageant party. This was all because I used a stopwatch to time the service, and I complained to the Hooters in Georgia about my service of ignorance during my servers shift.   Remember, & keep in mind that my server did NOT do the best nor greatest job of customer service (emphasizing this, as this is a key factor here). Management at this location has not wanted to lift my ban, and don't want me back at all, because I used a stopwatch to time the service, & complained to the Hooters in Georgia about my customer service experience. I did try talking to management, but this problem has not been resolved, & now, this Hooters has lost my business as a former regular customer.   If I could give this location any lower than one star, it would be - 5 stars, for the service I received only for that day alone, the not-so-appreciated gratitude of respect and no friendly gesture from the management for kicking me out. I have realized for the past six months that this was a bad experience with a not-so-attentive server, that gave me an overall terrible service on a slow day she decided to ignore me.    If you have read this far into my review, please know that I have not made any of this up, as I tell the truth here. If you want better customer service, go to Tilted Kilt, Twin Peaks, or for great quality chicken wings, Buffalo Wild Wings. After what happened to me, almost one year ago, I will say this: I highly recommend NOT going to this Hooters."}
{"text":"I'll do a little Q&A with myself.  1) What's good about it? Location is right next to a good dive-ish bar.  A place for food in Uptown without having to hit Epicenter.  Lots of TVs to watch sports.  Wings for the most part have been good if you like the Hooters style wing.  2) What's not so good about it?  Customer service is attrocious.  End of story.  3) Care to elaborate?  Sure!  Overall it's just pretty clear that most of the staff there is not properly trained.  Even though my restaurant experience is limited I've been enough different places to see how well trained staff operate and most (not all) of the staff the 5 or so times I've been exhibited some behaviour that just made you want to scratch your head?  4) Can you give examples? Of course!  How unfair it would be for me not to give examples. - The waitresses at the bar have fallen under the category of either not attentive or unfriendly.  Most recent time waitress was very friendly but getting her attention was like trying to get an audience with the Pope.  I asked for a drink (just a soda), she forgot and then I had to track her down five minutes later. - Example of unfriendliness.  One time I go in to order wings.  About 12 minutes (I didn't have a stopwatch but I think I waited a reasonable amount of time) I inquired nicely about the status of my wings.  The main reason I asked was the waitress seemed rather flaky and I wanted to make sure she got my order in.  She goes on the defensive (as other waitresses have) just for asking this question and proceeds to explain how the wings take time.  If customer is politely asking Customer Service 101 suggests offering a simple \"They'll be up on a few minutes\". - The male manager when I've observed more or less stand in one place scoping out the bar rather than actually moving around and seeing if they actually help staff.  5)  If service is so bad, how come you kept going back? For the reasons mentioned in #1 and the fact that ultimately I did get my food and drink and nothing was wrong with it.  But my last experience was so bad I can't see myself going back anytime sooner.  6) I've noticed you're a guy.  How do I know you're not some angry pathetic loser who is just upset because the Hooters gals weren't given you the attention you were looking for?  Believe  that if it makes you happy but end of the day whether it's an attractive young lady or someone that looks like my grandpa I still want good service.  In fact I've never really cared for the overly phony flirty service that Hooters waitresses engage in.  I like that any waiter/waitress that strikes a nice balance between genuine nice person and \"Yes I work for tips\".  But this case there was maybe one person I encountered who could strike that balance.  7) So what would you suggest?  If you're looking to drink and watch sports you have plenty of other options in the area.  For wings if you look around Yelp you can also find a number of quality options.  And if you need to see some eye candy while you eat wings and drink beer there are plenty of internet sites you can enjoy in the comfort of your own home while eating wings and drinking much cheaper beer.  But avoid this place like you should avoid making fried pickles the lone vegetable in your diet."}
{"text":"Sorry folks the service here in my experience has been just awful.  Sounds like others have had other better experiences but from going here about 5 times I can see it's not an isolated incident.  Bottomline- if you come in with a big group they'll give you the attention you deserve but if you come in solo or just with one other person you'll be disappointed.  Latest experience was coming in on a day they were doing a big nationwide promotion.  I had to actually educate on server that the promotion was going on.  Wings took over a half hour.  Kitchen looked short staffed- which hey it happens, people call out etc.  But the waitress must have passed our table at least a dozen times but no acknowledgement that we existed, asking if we wanted more drinks, update on when our food was coming out etc.  Sure you're busy with other tables but you still have to give everyone you're serving the time of day.  I know the Hooters brand prides itself on having its waitresses provide a certain kind of experience.  I could care less about that and would settle for meeting the basic standards for hospitality. Never had any complaints about the food.  Hooters still does a good wing.  Wish all my tips could go straight to the hard working people in the kitchen.  They're the real superstars of this place. My advice if you're thinking of going here for football seasons- get your order to go!  With the money you'll save on beer and tips you can spring for the Sunday ticket on your own."}
{"text":"This was actually my first Hooter's experience.  The first time was also the best.  The  waitress did not look like a plastic barbie doll and was really laid back.  She even did some cool hula hoop tricks too.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious and the sides were pretty good.  Unfortunately, it went downhill from there.  The next few times, we got this plastic barbie waitress with dull personality.  She was very flaky and  the food would take a while to come.  I always cringed if she was our waitress, and she was until I left Arizona for good.  I'm sure the establishment has gotten worse over the  years, don't miss it one bit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional. I understand it is \"Hooters\" but it is a place of business and I have some extremely concerning issues to discuss. To begin: We waited on our wings for over an hour. The restaurant was not crowded in the slightest.   We had been there for over an hour, and had not been offered a drink refill and had two pitchers, empty, sitting on the edge of the table. I got my wings 10 minutes before the rest of our party, there were 5 of us total, and the rest of our table didn't receive their food for an additional 10-15 minutes.   I have worked in the food service industry on and off for many years and I know wings take 9 minutes tops. Sure there were people in the restaurant but it was not busy and not that difficult to fry wings and make a chicken finger sandwich. One of the patrons ordered boneless, unlimited wings and not only did the waitress get the order wrong (he got bone in) he ordered the second order as soon as the first one was dropped off and didn't receive them because it took so long and we left.   I asked to speak to a manager and they did the absolute bare minimum to remedy the situation. 50% off the incorrect order, no drinks comped, I am fully disappointed in the service.    I am going to further address the staff and inform the restaurant, and those reading the review that the waitress proceeded to come up to the table after I spoke to the manager and tried to not only argue with me but accused me of attacking her. I truly did not speak to her besides telling her that we needed to see a manager because our service was unacceptable.   This was completely inappropriate behavior, and if I remembered her name I would email the restaurant directly as I was truly offended. As many can see I am extremely reasonable when it comes to service and my reviews are unbiased.   All in all: our order was incorrect and it took over an hour. I had no issue with the waitress until I asked to speak to the manager and she then became confrontational.   My advice, unless you are willing to spend an hour waiting on food, run out of drinks and have the staff get in your face I would highly suggest finding a different place to eat uptown. (There is a Buffalo Wild Wings less than a mile away.)"}
{"text":"I've been to this Hooters at least 5x and I don't like the wings, but I don't like wings so what do I know.   I always come with a large group and they all enjoy the heck out of it. They're very accommodating if you plan in advance or one the spot as well. They also take great lengths to make gluten free wings and non seasoned fries. Which the curly fries are rather nice.   I tried my luck with a Tom Collins and although it tastes quite sour, maybe too much lemon or the club soda, it has the proper alcohol ratio and garnish. No one everrr gets the garnish right, most people think it's a lime but it's orange and cherry, so well done.   Tried the key lime pie, my fav, and it tasted a little staticy like a refrigerator if that makes sense so I won't order again but I ate it...well half of it   Finally after yrs they did the birthday song I've longed to hear and the women were great. Very funny. Normally I get a better than you, vapid vibe from the competitors waitresses but they were fun to talk to and didn't seem \"down\" on me.   Only problem I have with them in general is my several rejected applications despite sales, marketing, hosting and bar tending experience and my friends telling me I have great hooters, it was implied to me I should apply without curly hair... Do you ever see particularly dark or curly ladies? Wish I did."}
{"text":"Went for the all you can eat wings on Monday and by the time we were done, well all were full and hated ourselves, which means it was good.   It was a quiet Monday afternoon so the staff was attentive and friendly. Place was clean and classic. Food was greasy and plentiful. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a hooters in a while because I had a bad experience with a manager in Burbank which I was a local customer for 10 years and I didn't feel he treated his employees correctly and I won't go back till he's gone. But I will tell you he could use a lesson from the hooters in Phoenix. The manager nick was very caring and so was Jen. The food came out fast and everybody was awesome to us. Thank you"}
{"text":"Went there last night (6-17) Stood at the front for 5 minutes until we were acknowledged and sat. Sat at a dirty table that had silverware there. Luckily the person that sat us cleaned it off. Then it took 12 minutes to be greeted due to no one knowing who our server was. After that everything was good. Our service was excellent from there on. One thing that I noticed is that the manager was no where to be found. We were there for an hour and didn't see him/her once. The manager needs to pay attention to the floor and do something about the front entrance when guests come in. Not having a hostess is understandable due to how slow it is but they need to make sure that they are more attentive. This falls on the manager who was no where to be seen."}
{"text":"So expensive !!  Rude waitstaff and a skinny manager drooling over skinny waitresses. Ick"}

Sure were a lot of boobs around the building, but sorry girls, your sets do not compare one of the girls in my party of 3. :)  All boobs aside, since I was a first timer, my girlfriends gave me a brief crash course of the menu and some recommendations. We started off with fried pickles for appetizers and 20 piece boneless chicken. Not knowing what kind of seasoning we want for our chicken, our Hooters girl was chill enough to allow us to do half and half on certain flavors to explore around. She recommended the Honey Thai seasoning and we chose the Cajun to seal the deal.  Our fried pickles came out, fresh out of the fryer, and we dove right in. Too bad they only gave out one dinky cup of dipping sauce, which completely ran out halfway into our appetizer. They charge extra for extra sauce (oh come on, really?), but we still went ahead and requested some more. Our boneless chicken finally came and I like how each flavors were served in separate plates. The Cajun was spicy, yet tolerable, and indeed SALTY! I suppose that's how Cajun seasoning is supposed to be, but it was alright. The Honey Thai, recommended by our Hooters girl, was probably my favorite. It's sweet, with a hint of spiciness. I would like it if the spiciness was kicked up another notch, but our Cajun wings already covered that department, so it was all good. They were also a bit salty.  Overall, it was a nice and SALTY experience. I think I chugged down 3 cups of water throughout the meal. Our Hooters girl was also nice enough to split our check three ways. She definitely got a nice tip from all of us.  I want to give it 3.5, but had to round up because of the accommodating staff and clean atmosphere.  Warning for those at risk for high blood pressure, this is where sodium dwells."}
{"text":"I understand the game was on as well as the fight, but I waited for 3 hours before I was even seated or offered anything to drink. My server must have had a long night."}
{"text":"On May 28, 2016  we went to eat after the Chris Tucker Comedy Show and the wait time  over 45 minutes.  I can  understand if the place was packed but it wasn't. This was my first time there and I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Super rude service from Bartender/server responsible for take out. Rolled her eyes the entire time heand didn't bother to hand me my change.   Never again, I'll drive to the one by Metro - Thanks."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving three stars is because of the initial service my family was given.  This was our first time coming to a Hooters. Stood in the doorway, looking around like idiots for 5 minutes before the bartender just told us to sit wherever. Okay? There are servers just wandering the floor, and no one can greet us properly?   So the staff could use a really improvement.   That was all made up for when our food came out, tasted fresh and it was hot. Which was an A+ our book. Yummy, yummy food.   Hopefully if we just visit another Hooters, the service will be better."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just went in there and shared 20 chicken wings. We ordered them naked style; he had the lemon pepper dry rub and I had the hot Buffalo sauce.  They were great.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned, and nice and hot.  And, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went to hooters on the Las Vegas strip with my family and we were enjoying our meal until I felt something weird in my mouth. I slowly pulled one long HAIR out and come to see I was chewing on a few more! After discovering this digusting and unpleasant thing in my mouth I look over at the kitchen and noticed that none of the cooks had their beards covered   and the cooks who had long hair did not have a hair net on. I brought this to the attention of management but he did not care. I told the manger I will pay for the rest of my meals but I refuse to pay for the wings, due to the fact that there was human HAIR in them. When I refused to pay for the wings, Security was called on me and my family. Me and my family was trespassed from the property. I then spoke with a gentleman who is above management by the name of Robert Trybridge and I quote he said, \"It is what it is\". Hooters on the Las Vegas strip has no respect for their customers nor care about heath code regulations."}
{"text":"I've been to Hooters a few times and never was a huge fan.  My wife and I decided to try out the new Hooters inside the Palms casino.  We were pleased with the service, food and the prices.  I got the hottest wings they offer (kinda hot) and my wife got the Twisted Texas melt (awesome).  The bartenders and servers were very attentive and took care of us well.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Just left this location. Literally walked in and walked right out.   My husband and I walked in at 9:00pm & asked for a table for 2 & a baby. Mind you, my 7 month old daughter was asleep in her car seat. The Brunette that met us at the door grabbed two menus and proceeded to try to sit us in the outdoor/indoor patio. There's a cold breeze & she can clearly see that we have our child with us.  My husband asked if there was any where else that we could be seated. She said she could only sit us there. Really?   May I just say.... There were only people at the bar. There may have been one person that was watching TV in the main eating area, who could have possibly been a worker.   Where's the customer service? Where's the accommodation?"}
{"text":"Two and a half stars is too much for this place. I came here while waiting on something else in the area and happen to remember the Golden Knights are playing. I had just sat down at the main bar and the lady bartender (short mid-aged blonde) asked me if I'm playing the bar video machines. I say no and she quickly with an attitude tells me I need to move because these seats are for people playing while watching the game. I look at her and look around at the 16 people sitting around the bar with plenty of available seats and there is ONE person playing. I say umm excuse me, no one is playing, why do I need to move? She says people just getting off work will be arriving soon (I just got off work) and will need the seats for the bar video games. We kinda start arguing about it and I tell her I'm not moving. Another guy comes over and threatens to kick me out if I don't move to the other area. I tell him to look around and see how many people are playing. He does and still says i need ti move. I ask the lady to my immediate right if she is playing and she say no loud enough for them to hear. I slide over to kinda be between the bar video games machines and say there I'm not in-front of the machine now. After this the bartender lady was giving me attitude and took forever to even provide service to me. I eventually have to stop her and ask for water and a menu. I will definitely not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I am not a big hooters fan when it comes to their food, I have been to several in my area. But this one in the hotel was spectacular! !!  The service was great, quick, and friendly. The deep fried pickles were very crispy and warm. And lots of them... wings were juicy and were very sauced... not a huge dry spot or dry chicken on inside like I normally get at other hooters.  French fries were warm, crispy, fluffy centers, and lofts of those too! ! Would defenitely recommend. ..  4 out of 5 because you have to go in to eat... no menus or waiters poolside at all... that was hugely dissapointing...."}
{"text":"This Hooters is fine but lacks atmosphere IMO. The staff seem to do what they need to and then talk to each other more than providing the service I've previously encountered in the Hooters around the world we've been too.   My hula hoop pins colada was on mark, the beer HUGE, the 3 island wings crispy and hot(ish)and the curly fries as they should be. The teriyaki wings though were sweetness to an extreme and I didn't enjoy them.   The plates the food was served on, the ones we had and the pressed tin cutlery just added to the disappointment.   The atmosphere and staff made me want to leave straight after our lunch and not even have dessert."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! The bread of one of the burgers had mold, the waitress also forgot another friends order; they ran out of fries (yes! incredible!) and changed the order of another one. A complete mess, bad service and terrible food. The burgers had no flavor whatsoever, just a complete disaster. Too sad because we were there for a bday. Oh by the way the cake was supposed to be secret and the waitress came to confirm \"if we had indeed ordered a bday cake\", so that was it for the element of surprise. NEVER going back there."}
{"text":"This Hooters has the sorriest service known to man, especially considering it's never busy during the day. I went to pick up a takeout order. There were literally 5 people at the bar. I waited 7 minutes before the waitress, Brittany, acknowledged my existence. The actual food was fine this go around. It's hit and miss. Just never come here in a rush. You will leave frustrated."}
{"text":"I went here to watch the NCAA march madness and the bar was able to accommodate even during a Habs game. The bartenders were very friendly and offered great service throughout the games."}
{"text":"I honestly don't care what anyone thinks about me when i post that i love Hooters by the Airport. The place rocks for a couple reasons (and no its not the large boobs)   1) the Patio is large, right on the runway so if your into plane spotting its awesome. I saw the A380 fly over once while enjoying a cold one.  2) The place is amazing for sports! All the screens for UFC are tuned to the fight (there are a massive amount of TV's There) and the place gets a great crowd for UFC. They also have a great NFL line up with $2.00 bud and bud light on sale during Sunday game times for. I don't like bud i will stomach it for the price. The food is ok for a night out for UFC and beer."}
{"text":"This place is brand new.   Service was quick and friendly.  Much much better than the service at Hooters Hotel and Casino.  If your in Vegas and craving some good wings this is the spot"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try a hooters restaurant you hear all the hype about the wings and drinks so why not! We walked in not one person greeted us we kind of just stood there for about 2 minutes then finally one of the girls comes up asks if we want a booth or table we say booth and she said okay wait while we clean it. Then when it's done she tells us go ahead and walk over there so we did she brought our menus about a minute later. Then our waitress came she was very friendly if it wasn't for her I'd give the place no stars. She took our drink orders came back with the drinks which were awful I got a strawberry margarita and wow was it sweet almost not drinkable. After that drink I just ordered water cause it was so bad. Our food came out in a timely matter we didn't wait to long we got some boneless wings to share and I ordered there burger melt. The food wasn't bad it also wasn't amazing its just like normal diner food I'd say.. really nothing special. Our bill came out to $130 do I think it was worth it absolutely not way to over priced. And just the rudeness of the staff alone would make me never go back."}
{"text":"As far as Hooter's restaurants go (blech) this one is probably the best. I give it four stars as a reference to it's sister locations, not in reference to how good it is overall. The food is terrible quality, and the drinks extremely \"well measured\" meaning they are not strong. Hence why I can drink 12 margaritas in a 6 hour period and still be coherent. They sure charge for them like they are doubles though. There are a few girls working here who are very attractive and friendly (not to sound like a dirty old man, just that usually Hooter's has the worst service) and that definitely helps."}
{"text":"I've never had better customer service! We frequent here over anywhere else in Vegas because the staff is so personal and amazing.   Donald is such a great bartender and will make you feel like family. We also met a great waitress Lory who rocks as well. They make you feel welcome and will make you wanna come back everytime."}
{"text":"The food was great, as usual. The service however, oofa, it really was as bad as the other reviews. Zero on Hooters philosophy on customer service. I do come here to check a little leg too, but ugh, don't come here looking for a college hottie to serve you and chit chat a little. As I leave I think I'll let the GM know, this is my worst Hooters experience in 25 years. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocre everything with an expensive price tag.  The food was extremely average at best.  Fries were almost limp.  Boneless wings were annoyingly smile for their price tag.  And if you go here for the girls to schmooze you...best of luck.  I don't even care about the last bit but I imagine that's why many come back.  I won't be."}
{"text":"This place was about as bad as can be!!!  Came for Sangria.  But it's only from a bottle (some places doesn't make their own) but ok.  Secondly, the tray & table tent was gross!  Never cleaned. Felt horrible about touching it!!  Third, the windows (see pic) had a weeks worth of kids finger prints and snots on it.  The icing on the cake was when the food come me out and wings were barely half tossed and barely sauced.  Called the 'manager' \"Chris\" over from sitting and talking with his friends that were there, and asked him how they looked to him... he said 'could be better'  so ok.  We agreed.   He said I can go toss them again...   ummm. NO!  We asked to clarify, tossed or remake.  He asked 'oh would you like them remade?' To that....   no thanks.  Jus remove them.  We're leaving.  (With an attitude) Never once did he try and remedy the situation like a manage should!   HOWEVER MACY OUR SERVER WAS FANTASTIC.  She couldn't have apologized more and tried her hardest to fix the situation her boss couldn't."}
{"text":"After having a half decent experience in November I decided to give it another chance. Happily meeting the new management named Louis and being served by the extraordinary Veronique my thoughts are completely different. Due to their beyond capabilities of GREAT customer service and willingness to realize the needs and wants of the customer our experience was phenomenal. Not only did I leave happy I will most definitely be going back very soon. I suggest to anyone reading this go on down and enjoy your evening."}
{"text":"Waited over 40 minutes for a half-pound of dry ground beef; nothing \"BBQ\" about the BBQ Western burger. If the rest of the menu is the same quality, no wonder they need girls in shorts and tank tops to get customers!"}
{"text":"I'm an awesome wife damnit and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! My husband has a thing for the food at Hooters (yeah right, lol!) so I oblige and go with him to eat at Hooters about every year or 2 (yup that's all I can stand!).   This was our first visit at this location, we're used to the TX locations where the girls are MUCH hotter (my husband called the girls at  this location \"the Tuesday daytime shift girls from a strip club\"), and the food apparently in TX is better. Who knew.   Beer was $3.50 for 22.5 oz. Not too shabby there.   My husband got \"medium\" wings. While he claims they are tasty and perfect, they were definitely off on the spice level. My husband can't handle spice at all and these had 0 flavor. So I guess medium = mild = flavorless at hooters .   Lots of Tots sounded yummy on the menu (tots with cheese, bacon, and sour cream) but were pretty weak.   And now on to the real low-rating clencher... I don't really like chicken wings so at hooters I get snow crab legs. I know, some could call me stupid, but honestly I'm not THAT picky about snow crab legs. I can eat some pretty bad ones and be happy. I get them in TX at Hooters and they are fine.. acceptable.. These were brownish/grey.. literally.. and really disgusting. I called them the nastiest crab legs ever but then had to retract that statement. That honor belongs to the Rio seafood buffet!  Bottom line: Come here for the beer (if you're so inclined), but don't eat anything ! As Rufus mentioned the cocktail servers at nearly ANY casino are much better looking."}
{"text":"I echo everything Richard Z. says about the food. It sucks. It sucks enough that I had a violent reaction to seeing the smarmy-dick CEO on TV the other night. I just got a reminder of how lame their food is two nights before at the Tempe location, and I still mourned the loss of my $20.  How can Hooters get away with basically selling stuff that wouldn't be accepted at a school cafeteria?  Well, they have girls in tight outfits. That's how they get away with it. Not that they are attractive. In fact, locally it's only the Tempe location that seems to have a reliable supply of waitresses who don't pad their mustaches down with foundation make-up and don't in some way remind me of my mom.   So I applaud Richard on his generosity in giving 4-stars to this gaping wound on the soul of America. But I can't join him in his open-mindedness.   And here's why:  Hooters is nothing less than a titty-bar for henpecked husbands. Guys who can't go to see actual bare breasts at a gentleman's club for fear of landing in divorce court can indulge their fantasies of what life would have been like for them had the rubber not broken on that date ten years before just by going to Hooters. I can't remember the times I've been dragged to Hooters for lunch by groups of nice, married guys at work who will only refer to it as \"that WINGS place\" with a smutty grin. This is their little fun indulgence--their minor sin.  So I can't agree that Hooters \"is what it is\" and therefore deserves anything more than one star. It is a pallid imitation of something that we are still too repressed to acknowledge, and the insipid, revolting food makes it a total rip-off."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I've been going to Hooters for over 20 years and it never disappoints!! This new location is top notch, is always clean, and there's what seems like a rotation of new girls working every time I come! Add to that a newly vamped menu, pool tables, plenty of big screens, new wing flavors, and a good selection of Big Daddy sized beers on tap and you've got yourself a perfect getaway oasis in the desert!!!"}
{"text":"Hooters all ways has the best wing no matter where yo go no matter where I go I know I can always count on hooter to have the best wings"}
{"text":"My server and the host who greeted us were so polite and helpful, unfortunately everything else was a pain. We came in on Saturday night for food and to watch a UFC fight. The cover was $10. It was busy, but not slammed in my opinion. We were sat at our table and waited 20 minutes to get our drink order and only because the host noticed we hadn't. The lighting was super bright and the stools at the table were very uncomfortable, plus the TV I was facing did not work properly. So we decided to sit somewhere else, the tv in that area worked, the lighting was much better but then it was too cold, the fans were blasting and since my server was no where to be found I couldn't tell her about it. We didn't wait too long for the food but the server who delivered our food (not the assigned server)  just took off, we didn't have any utensils and I wanted to ask for an extra item. We had to flag down the host to help us out.   The chicken taco salad I got was ok, we were surprised to find out that pitchers of modelo were $25 (holy moly) and shots were $10.50! Might as well have gone to the strip for those prices.   I watched the fight uncomfortably and was glad it was over so I could finally warm up."}
{"text":"The food is like all other hooters.  I love the wings and fried pickles.  We go with a bunch of guys from work for lunch 8-12 a month.  In the past one of our guy orders a tea with flavor in it they have never charge him more and they always give him refills.  Yesterday the charged .50 more for his tea and no refill.  Crazy how we are always there and now they are nickel and dime us to death.  To top off I gamble there and always drop over 500.00.  After talking to the clueless manger who is worried about .50.  We decide we won't be back.  Our new place is Another wing place.  It's a shame our bill was a was over 90.00"}
{"text":"Wish I could select zero stars!  We were seated at the FURTHEST hightop away from rest of the  patrons. The waitress was friendly, but when a bug was found in a friend's drink, no apology given and no arguement from said waitress when all 5 of us got up and left (despite having a fresh bottle of beer delivered to the table). Ding! Ding! Ding! Probably means that this is not a singular occurrence... Do not go! :(  #gross"}
{"text":"Worst service ever ... You have to be a single man to be treated right ... Sad :( Never coming to this location again ... or maybe Hooters in general"}
{"text":"I was there with my buddies last night, we ordered bunch of chicken wings and a mini burger platter. It's all new, they recently opened.   The food is okay, it's finger foods right, it goes really well with beer :)   Ambiance is nice, even though it was Monday night, it has a good vibe.   Service wise... Well it's hooters, the waitress are smiley and they are pretty nice.. If you know what I mean lol.  But it's kind of weird that we waited a bit longer than usual for our foods as well as our beers.   It's still new, they need some times to tuned up a little. I'm sure they will get better. The location is gold! Straight in downtown on crescent!   Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"Much cleaner and more open feeling than most Hooters. The pub-style food is consistently good and the service always includes a big smile. The signature hooters wings are fantastic so are the buffalo shrimp IF you can get them butterflied. I also tried the shrimp po-boy sandwich for the first time and was really impressed."}
{"text":"Hooters is Hooters... so I didn't expect much coming in here. However, our server was very friendly and she pointed out several food specials which saved us a few bucks. Anyway, I come here about once a year just for the buffalo shrimp - which they still butterfly at the downtown Tempe location (much tastier). We also tried the shrimp po boy which was more than enough to feed two."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with this place really. I went for the hot waitresses with huge knockers and there weren't any! WTF?   I didn't try much of the food but the celery sticks were quite good. Wings looked decent.   It was uncomfortably hot inside. The interior is quite spacious but the particular place we were seated at (a large table for 12) was cramped in really tight between two other long tables.   It's really a shame we couldn't access the patio (it was raining) because I have quite fond memories of that patio. Great for people watching.  Our waitress had a bit of a crusty attitude. She was probably used to getting more attention, but our table was clearly unimpressed with her B cups. I saw her roll her eyes a few times when she couldn't get our attention.  Overall, great time due solely to awesome company (11-12 yelpers). Would go back but only for the patio (if the sun ever decides to shine in 2011)."}
{"text":"Not so much. Fried pickles are what got me there and they were good, although the dipping sauce was weird. Good news is that they have improved on the size of the chicken wings and gotten rid of that creepy fin part. Bad news, they suck. Still taste like flour (if you get the breaded ones). Ordered with medium sauce - no flavor. Asked for extra sauce - she brings me a container (for a $1) of this hardened butter/lard stuff. I don't understand - I wanted extra hot sauce on my wings. These girls are clueless. Fries - as always undercooked and anemic.  I seriously try to give this place some credit because they make the best fried pickles, but I cant recommend anything else about this joint. Sadly enough I think the entire chain is really going down hill. I am concerned for these scantly clad girls.... where does one go from there?"}
{"text":"Smaller restaurant. The hooter wings are smaller compared to the others. The Hooter girls were friendly."}
{"text":"Decent service and food. I ordered 6 Daytona Naked Wings and 6 bacon wrapped wings. The bacon wrapped wings tasted like regular wings with no bacon although real bacon was wrapped around the wing. The Daytona sauce is pretty good. The ranch and blue cheese is too watered down."}
{"text":"Worst service. The kitchen couldn't keep up with the number of people cause of the formula 1, so we had to wait 10 minutes before we order.  Quality of food was mediocre : cold- blend. I didn't even finish my plate and my fiancée returned her back..  DISASTER!!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this location many times, but had kids with us, so never went inside. We decided Saturday it was time to check it out. Wow, the food was over priced and horrible. We complained about it all! Our waitress was very understanding, and tried to accommodate us. But we just kept getting irritated a little more after each item. First was our table. We walked up to the hostess desk, and she told us to seat ourselves. After walking to three different tables, we tried cleaning the less messy one, to get irritated and walked back to the hostess. When we told her all three tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned, she coped an attitude and gently touched one for us. It was still sticky that we had to ask for a towel and wipe it down again. At this point I was ready to leave, but the people with me calmed me down a bit. We started our order with pretzels and beer cheese. The \"bread\" was not a pretzel and hard/burnt/over cooked, and the beer cheese was so loaded with green onions, all you tasted was onions. When we called the waitress over, she apologized and said they have been getting a lot of complaints tonight. Really? So fix it! Then one of us ordered 6 wings in a hot sauce of some kind. The \"wings\" came out like little bites, not wings, and with the wrong sauce. This friend didn't complain, so I did. The waitress apologized and said, those were their wings. How can you been known for wings, and don't serve proper wings with the sauce ordered? I personally ordered a plain grilled chicken sandwich. When I bit into it, there was so much hot seasoning, I couldn't eat it. When I called the waitress over and told her it wasn't a plain sandwich, she said, \"oh yea, we season all our chicken breasts.\" Well, why didn't you say that when I ordered? Someone ordered a raspberry tea, and when we got the bill, there was a charge for a tea, and another charge for raspberry syrup. Really? The cost of that horrible meal was way too expensive for what we actually ate versus ordered. Needless to say, we left incredibly disappointed, and had to get dinner elsewhere. What a waste of two checks!! There are so many other awesome places to eat in this town, stay away from Hooters!"}
{"text":"Not impressed the restroom was filthy and they shorted me on the shrimp.... I see why Del Taco has a better rating"}
{"text":"Honestly folks, its a Hooters bar...  I mean what original commentary can I possibly offer?  The location is fantastic given its proximity to local hotels/motels.  On top of that, I thoroughly enjoyed their St. Paddy's Day specials.  However, their bar fare is average, as is their bar staff.    A \"must\" if visiting from out of town and staying at a nearby hotel."}
{"text":"If I could give them a negative star I definitely would. Server Brianne was very unprofessional kept us waiting 15 minutes before she came to take our order. She assisted all the tables on each side of us and passed us several times. I asked for her manager, Bill Rovnack, who instead of apologizing and doing what he could to make the situation better, he gave reasons as to why she would have done such a thing. We asked for a different server of which he could not accommodate basically forcing us to be comfortable with the negligent server or leaving. Terrible experience, never coming to this location again!!!!"}
{"text":"Food ok. Girls look nice."}
{"text":"So it's been years since I've been to hooters now I remember why. The food is seriously sub par. My friend I and both ordered their chicken sandwhichs. The food came out in a decent amount of time. My bottom bun was soggy and the chicken tasted like it was boiled totally bland, along with the curly fries. My friend said his tasted the same too. I gave them a extra star cause the bartender Karen was very polite and attentive but the rest of the staff could care less about the customers. I asked the other bartender if they were busy today she said no and that hey're never busy. I wonder why?"}
{"text":"Not the greatest place in the world, there food is boring and greasy and the girls dont really have a personality. There are better hooters to go to that will give you more for your money. The wings have no flavor really-you ask for hot and it seems like you get mild or wimp. The staff is friendly enough but not friendly enough to frequent this location. The girls dont have \"hooters\" and they have like on cook in the kitchen. Not the worst place, but not the best."}
{"text":"The wings are really good.  I've been 3 times for wings and a beer.  The best part was the drunk guy in the corner doing air-karate and talking to himself.  What a show!  The place was dead though, don't let me make it seem like the place is frequented by weirdos.  There's nothing wrong with the place, it just isn't 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great for the games and a draft beer. But other than their wings and onion rings, nothing else is worth spending your $$ on. Besides, their prices are a bit on the high end for dry and tasteless food.   As I said before, I go for the games and draft beer. Rarely do I order anything aside from wings... If you go, don't expect good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Hooters for lunch dates as often as we can.  I love the wings and he loves the grilled cheese!  We always have a blast when we visit!!  All of the waitresses we have had have been wonderful.  Our waitress last time was especially wonderful!!  Britt is a  mom and full time student as well as a hard working waitress!  She smiled and engaged us all the way through our meal.  We really appreciated her.  Five stars all of the way for Hooters Champaign.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Tables were a bit uncomfortable and the music was way too loud (from the pool). Wish they had healthier options too."}
{"text":"I can truly say this is the worst Hooters ever Customer service was terrible and the chef should really be fired they brought out chicken wings with no sauce fill with a whole bunch of grease it was so nasty that it made us sick and we had to send the drinks back because they were disgusting also you will definitely be waiting a long time to get your food like 45 mins to an hour on a Monday when there is no one In there BEWARE DON'T GO TO THIS HOOTERS you will be very disappointed !!!!"}
{"text":"we order togo from this hooters once every few months...we stopped dining in at the location because the service was always mediocre at best...tonight i called in a togo order for 20 wings, 24 buffalo shrimp, and fried pickles at 8:47pm...i was told it would be ready in 15 minutes or less...we are just right down the street from hooters so i waited a few minutes then left...i got to the location right at 9pm...i went in and no one was at the hostess stand so i went to the bar to advise the bartender that i was there to pick up my togo order that i had called in...well this was a wait in and of itself...the bartender was too busy having drinks with (what i assume) are regulars and/or friends of hers and they were the only ones that she tended to...even the older gentleman sitting a few seats from me was complaining outloud that it was tough to get a beer...she finally came to me and said it would be just a minute...she came back 5 or so minutes later and i told her i was there to pickup my callin order, she said you need to do that at the hostess stand, i told her no one is there and i have always gotten my order from the bartender in the pass, she seemed surprised and said oh let me check...we are now rounding 25 minutes pass and the bartender has come back to join her friends (SMH)...finally at 35 past (im now ready to leave as i expected to be back home by now) a girl comes out with a togo order and told me sorry it took so long and that she wanted to open everything and check it with me so there \"were no suprises\"...the first box she opens has like 6 wings in it and she goes these are the cajun wings...uhm...NOPE, didnt order those, she says oh, ooops, i got 2 togo orders at the same time and it got so hectic...uhm, really, perhaps its time to find a new field of work...sorry sweetie...she then tells me to hold on and she would be right back...so im waiting, waiting, waiting again and i now see her, and 3 other waitresses over with a table of 2 guys on the restaurant side...i look at my watch and it is now 945...she looks to have no intentions on checking on my order, so i have no intention on sitting around waiting to get food to feed my boyfriend and i any longer...goodbye."}
{"text":"We don't come often but when we do it's on a Tuesday because they have a BOGO special on wings   Restaurant is somewhat clean. It is however very inconsistent and staff seems to be disorganized. Wings never come out the same. Sometimes it good, sometimes it's burnt and sometimes it's too saucy. Head chef, what's going on? Because of the inconsistency, flavors are never the same.   Staff is friendly but majority is not as \"kid friendly\". Takes a long time to get the check and whatnot."}
{"text":"I worked at hooters for 8 months and let me tell you! There is this manager who is an absolute pig named Julius. He tells the cooks that all the girls are \"lazy hoes\". He told a hispanic girl to \"go home and get your green card\", he said to another girl \"are you retarded? literally, do you have a mental illness?\". He is a bad person and should be fired! Multiple girls have quit/walked out during a shift, including myself. I will be calling HR about him! He makes a fun place to work turn into the worst place to work so quickly. Hooters should change their ways if they want to keep a good staff going."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Hooters Restaurant inside the Hooters Casino/Hotel. They are open 24 hours - which is great for many reasons. I happened to be staying at the hotel here, so I ended up at the restaurant on several occasions at different times during the 24 hours.   On our first visit, we stopped in around midnight on a Wednesday night. There was a wait to be seated, so we went to the bar side and sat there to eat. No one minded this, however, it was quite clear that the restaurant was not staffed adequately. Who ever was in charge of the schedule really dropped the ball. The bartender was OK, and the food was good. It was the first time I have ever eaten at a Hooters, and I was surprised at how awesome the fried pickles were.   I returned at 5am that morning, mainly for caffeine and so as not to disturb my roommates as I had a few hours of work to complete by 9 CST. I sat in the restaurant area, which was pretty quite at that time. Again there seemed to be a scheduling goof: there was one hostess and one server on, and about 20 people in the kitchen. It seems like it would make more sense to have two waitresses on and cut the kitchen staff down. That being said the waitress and hostess, Brittany and Crystal, were fantastic. They were super friendly and bright-eyed - you would have never guessed it was the end of their graveyard shift. They checked on me often and made me feel like a Cheers-style regular. The waitress that took over for Crystal (I failed to get her name) was also really nice. The breakfast was OK: eggs and toast with extra potatoes as I don't do breakfast meat.  On my third visit, we got the food To-Go and dined by the pool. I had the club sandwich and more fried pickles. Both were delicious. I could seriously eat those fried pickles every day.   Overall I would have to say: Brittany and Crystal are real assets to the restaurant. The food ranges from OK to amazing. Find someone to make a schedule that actually understands restaurant staffing, or at least has some common sense. Also, it seems like the Hooters brand is really build on the girls that work there. That being so, they should be treated better than a piece of chicken wing. Give them cute low-cut hoodies to wear when it is cold at work, reward them for good service and work ethic, and show them some appreciation. It seems like a bunch of fat-cat dudes are at the top of that food chain who really take advantage of girls looking to make a buck."}
{"text":"Went to watch the UFC fight Saturday night.  Ordered 5 or 6 drinks with our group and gave bartender my CC.  The girls played on the machines so bartender comped our drinks and we gave him a $20 tip.  He gives me back my credit card and we split.   The next morning, Sunday, I realize he gave me back the wrong credit card.  Called twice and was told \"Oh Shit\" and so sorry.  Someone will call me back.  Today is Wednesday and I am still missing my credit card AND have someone else's.   No call from anyone.  Really sad and unprofessional.  Can I have my $20 tip back?  Bartender was the guy with black hair and ponytail.   Huge annoyance and problem they caused me.   Surprise Surprise...no one wants to deal with the problem they created for TWO of their customers by giving their credit cards away to the wrong person..."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fry, very loud environment"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night with a party to watch the UFC Fight.  We literally had to seat our selves since no one bothered. Drinks were brought out quickly and order was taken quickly. We ordered a order of boneless strips in the Buffalo sauce and they were good. My husband ordered 10 wings in the teriyaki sauce and he said that the sauce was gross flavored but this is not the biggest issue here. The first wing he tried to eat he stated that it tasted funny and he couldn't barely pull the meat off the bone so he moved on to the next wing and ate half of it before realizing that it tasted horrible as well and after further inspection realized that it was Completely RAW! He checked all of his wings and they were all RAW! That is Horrific needless to say!  We quickly told the waitress who said oh ok sorry and took them and walked away. SHOCKING!  After about 15 minutes the manager came over and offered to have some more made. Ummmnnn NO THANK YOU!  My husband actually started feeling sick and went to the restroom and proceeded to throw up. Upon coming back the ticket was given to us and included his wings on it. WTH?? So I called the manager over who took care of just his raw meal. Before we left a groupd of our friends were leaving as well because both of their chicken came out raw also and one of them was getting sick! I will be contacting the health department in the morning immediately!  This can kill someone with salmonella!  What is this was served to a kid and they didn't know it was raw? SHAME ON YOU HOOTERS of GASTONIA!  Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Paul the bar manager is awesome!!! Lemon Pepper wings are amazing and the Hooter girls on a Friday night are blonde and really cute. My girl friend & I will definitely be back again & again :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing Hooters.  I convinced a couple of my American friends to join me at this Hooters and I was embarrassed.  The wings here were a lot smaller and worse than the ones at the Hooters in the States.  We ordered: 20 Piece Wings ($18) Tater Tots ($6.50) - they were the frozen kind Poutine $8 - not good"}
{"text":"Ugh, my second review on this restaurant. Last night approximately 6:30pm on a non-busy \"all you can eat wings Wednesday\", we waited for over 40 mins for someone to finally helped us. She finally approached us asking if we been helped yet and we said, \"no, we been waiting here for about 40mins.\" She apologized and asked, what we would like to drink and if we were ready to order.  After we placed our orders, it took almost about 20-30 mins for water to finally come to our table, 30 mins for our first round of wings, 20 mins for our second round of wings, 20 mins for the next round of wings, which was cold...and they forgot about our fries, which later to be \"on the house\", which took over an hour after we placed our orders to finally come out.  We were dying with thirst because it took them over 30mins to come back and check on us. I'm disappointed on the mild sauce they had, it looked milky/creamy and there was no spice to it. At the end of the night after we paid, she offered us some free wings to take home if we stayed for a bit longer...bit longer was known to be over another 30mins and the wings were also cold. But I do appreciate her kindness and offering that to us. From the time being there, we had two tables that came before us and left before us. We left the restaurant approximately 9:15pm and arrived at approximately 6:30pm..."}
{"text":"Ate there Thursday afternoon.   Hot wings sauce was mild, the last 2 oysters were bad.  When mentioned to the waitress she just said \"oh\".  Clueless.   Won't be back ever."}
{"text":"My husband works near here so I met him for lunch today.  It was either this or Grimaldi's.  For the price, should have chosen Grimaldi's.  Anyway, I've been to Hooters before and used to love it for the cheap grilled cheese on the menu and inexpensive beer.  Hadn't been for a while and they took the grilled cheese with tomato off the menu.  Sad times.  I asked for it and the woman said that grilled cheese was only on the kids menu now and not available for adults.  I asked her if I could just have a plain grilled cheese for the \"adult\" price.  When I got it, it was a normal grilled cheese with a children's portion of fries.  The receipt showed a \"ham and cheese sandwich\" meal, which was the same price as my husband's burger.  Seriously?  This is their solution to grilled cheese not being on the menu anymore?  I should not have been charged the same price as a burger meal for a grilled cheese and children's portion of french fries.  I would have brought this up but my husband had to get back to work, so I let it go.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Called to place an order for pick up when they open @ 11am..  Asked if I could place my order now for when they open.  Was told \"NO to call back after 11am, The kitchen would not be ready to cook until then\".   Welp, guess you just lost an order to the competition across the street.   They took my order!!!   You are dead to me hooters."}
{"text":"Our server was Brandi was nice, but must have been new...  Every time we asked her a question on the menu, she would display the deer in the head lights look and say \"I don't know.\"  We went there for happy hour on this Friday late afternoon in February..The restaurant was not busy. Service was very slow, but the food though was good."}
{"text":"Tonight wasn't our best experience here. We got seated, the woman then asked us 5-10 mins later what to drink. We order an appetizer. When she comes back we ask for the check because we just came for the fried pickles. She asked if she had forgotten our entrees. Then we explained that's all we wanted. The order was 6 dollars and some change so my boyfriend gave her a 20. She apparently just gave us the change back for the whole 20. He hadn't counted the money back yet so we were confused as to why when we came out of the bathroom she was like \"you didn't pay for your food?\" We put 4 dollars down for her tip. She seemed so rude about it when it wasn't our fault. Also, should probably tell the waitresses to stop counting all their tips in the front, it's rude and extra."}
{"text":"Used my birthday email coupon for a free order of boneless wings on 10-30-15 friday around 10pm.  Was greeted at the door.  I sat at the bar.  Bartender was nice and friendly.   Service was fast and efficient.  No reverse happy hour so I only ordered 1 draft.  My wings were very good and I had the Daytona sauce.  No ranch cuz they charge but that's always been like that at any Hooters.  I watched the Suns game.  I took some fried pickles to go for my wife.  Both bartender and hostess said goodbye.  Ambiance was great.  Wasn't crowded.  I parked at a meter next to Hooters.  If u can wait till 10pm, the parking is free.  It was a very good experience.   This is the first Hooters to open in AZ and I've been going here for years.  Always a good time."}
{"text":"My husband and I waited 30 minutes and no one even came to say hi or take our drink order, we walked out. There were about 5 girls working all sitting at the bar or high top tables visiting one on one with guys, they seriously acted like strippers hanging all over these guys. This was our first visit to the Alma School location, we always went to the Superstition Springs location all the time as it was close to our house and we never had service or atmosphere like this visit was. Horrible! Won't be back nor do I recommend it to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch a bit of hockey and get some wings.  Dave the manager was awesome and the bartender kept my beer full and cold.  Go Caps!"}
{"text":"Server was friendly and got us everything we requested. Food came out great; however they did run out of certain menu items we wanted to order. It's okay, things happen. Told the server I wanted to pay for our family's check and to make it a secret. She came out with the bill and receipt while I was in the restroom. Overall not a bad experience. Would come here again and try other menu items."}
{"text":"I can see why they have such a low star rating. The customers who come here to still support this obviously failing business are treated poorly. The manager is pregnant and rude as hell. She opens the whole restaurant garage door thing on a 40 degree day saying \"sorry it has to be open\" has to be open? I highly doubt that but ok and that's why you have 2 stars because your customer service sucks! You would think she would be nice and trying to get better reviews but she'd rather just be a b*tch for no reason. Your employees are half naked and freezing cause she's pregnant, miserable, hormonal and clearly having hot flashes."}
{"text":"Round 2... So a bunch of guys dragged me to Hooters after watching a night of UFC. I really didn't plan on eating anything, so a drink would be safe. I ended up eating a few bites. It was a mistake, gave me a bellyache. 2 of the other guys had stomach issues also. Well we got mild (are very mild) boneless wings, they were okay, a little greasy. And deep fried pickles, also okay, need to be crispier but tasty...their pickles, how bad can they be. The extra charge for blue cheese and ranch is lame. I should've ran across the street to Albertsons and bought a bottle for about the same price. Our waitress did a good job but the guys agreed the eyecandy in this location is wasn't worth the heartburn, and 2 of them went outside to hit on girls that weren't Hooters waitresses. The drinks were good so I'd probably just go back for that, eh who am I kidding, I'll  give it one more chance? or will I??"}
{"text":"Omg. How can I hit to terrible places in one night. I had to wait 5 minutes to be seat.  10 to get an order in. 10 to get drinks. Now I'm waiting 30 minutes to get our order. Just horrible. Waitress didn't know if They had a hard apple cider. Ugh. Help Yelp."}
{"text":"I am usually not a Hooters (wink, wink) guy. Hooters Palms could turn me into a Hooters Guy!  Seriously, my two recent visits here showed this place to be on par with any Sportsbar I've been to in Vegas. My first visit was to watch The NCAA March Madness games because The Palms Sports Book was full. To my surprise, Their bar had several wheelchair accessible spots. I was able to sit at the bar and easily watch the games because they have a ton of big screen TV's. I ordered a Mushroom Swiss Burger and Curly Fries with a Mango Iced Tea. The Burger was Big and Juicy with tons of Sautéed Mushrooms and Cheese. The Fries were perfect. Crispy yet fluffy on the inside. The Tea was light and refreshing on a hot Vegas day.  Later the next day I stopped in for more Basketball, a snack and a drink! I ordered the naked wings with the Chesapeake Style Rub and a Margarita. The Margarita was well made and packed quite a punch. The wings were Huge, Crispy and Juicy! The rub gave them a nice Old Bay like flavor.  The bartenders and wait staff were friendly and efficient. I am not a big chain restaurant fan, but I will definitely make an exception for The Hooters at The Palms."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food.  That should end it, but a couple of details.  About 10 people in the whole enormous place for lunch.  Took us 10 minutes to order drinks and get the table wiped down (with 10 people, how are there even dirty tables?), then 15 more after that to order.  The \"Medium\" wings were plain.  When I inquired about it, was told medium means cooked in a butter sauce.  They were absolutely greasy and tasteless, but no way was I waiting another 20 minutes for something else.   And the price? -- $20 for 10 wings and a soda.  Management was non-existent.  Never going back to Hooters and maybe never to the Palms, it was that bad."}
{"text":"I can confirm this is closed.  I was, uh, just passing by.  Right, that's it!  Just passing by."}
{"text":"This is supposedly the largest hooters in the world or something. It's inside the Palms hotel. It's clean and easy to get to. BUT, being a Hooters you can be assured that...  1. The service sucks. 2. The food sucks.  We waited at the host stand for 10 mins before anyone even came out to greet us. The food order came wrong (always happens at ANY Hooters). And the food was borderline uneatable.   The entire point of a Hooters is for overweight middle aged men with a 500lb wife at home who would rather go play with the teenage hooters girls. No one really goes here for the food mind you."}
{"text":"Our out of town group headed to this Hooters to watch some football & relax after a day of meetings.  Our Hooters Girl was fresh out of training and served us all well.  The manager was very accommodating to us and made sure the football game was on the tv's nearest us so we all had a great view.  We had a new Hooters newbies with us, and I think they left impressed.  This Hooters is impressively large for a downtown location.  Plenty of seating including an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"It's been just over a year since my last review of this Hooters.  Today I dropped by for lunch en route to work in the area.  I had an incredibly bubbly Hooters Girl that was doing a superb job of interacting with her customers as well as serving all quickly. The buffalo chicken sandwich was meaty and spiced to my liking.   A pleasant Hooters Girl and delicious food = a very pleasant lunch experience."}
{"text":"Great service from Maria! Wings were bigger than I remember.  Tasty local alcoholic beverage and slidders."}
{"text":"When you think of Hooters... you think of big boobs. Well good luck in finding them here at this Hooters (located off the strip) lol jk  My rating of 1 star isn't become of the disappointment of presentation of women but because of the horrible service we received over dinner.   My friends and I have eaten at this location a couple of times and for some reason every time we come here, service is always poorly.   The vibe in here isn't like the vibe of the Hooters at Santa Monica, Hollywood or even like the Hooters on strip. The girls are not very friendly and the food was not so yummy either.   I ordered the Philly Cheesecake and the bread was so hard and the meat was so dry. The fries that came with the meal tasted gross and old.   I also ordered some wings with the Parmesan flavor and omg wayyyyy too much flavor. I had to wipe some off with my napkin and drench it in my ranch so I can eat it.  This Hooters location doesn't meet the expectations of the Hooters brand. I don't not recommend it."}
{"text":"No one at front desk to sit us. A waitress finally passes by and just tells us to sit any where. We pick a table in patio... no menús yet. We wait and wait. Finally try to get a waitress. Waitress comes over and says we can't sit in this area because it's closed off. We saw the sign but our table was not in that section, just next to it. We just left."}
{"text":"Chandra:  When you are asked, \"Do you have a full bar?\", handing me your specialty cocktails menu is NOT an answer.   And when a drink is ordered Ketel One and Tonic then that means Ketel One is the vodka requested.  Cheap whatever is not preferred and thank you for the headache and allergy reaction I was trying to avoid by not having Smirnoff, of which always gives me that reaction.  I realize this is not a place to go for fantastic food or awesome service.  That isn't the draw and this location does a fine job hiring cute girls.  My husband appreciates the view."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  Horrible service!  Was sitting at the bar and two bar tendetails made eye contact.  Ten minutes and still no acknowledgement I guess I can take my business else where."}
{"text":"Stopped by for.lunch with my son. Ordered some wings. Half were fresh the other half were old. The waitress disappeared to much.  HOOTERS quality has gone down a bit and the $3 for a 12oz class of soda seems expensive."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes and never got waited on. The place was dead. No excuse. No drinks, no food. I could understand if they were busy, but again, they were completely dead."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates. Raw chicken delivered straight to my door. They canceled my friends orders because they said the merchant was too busy. So I guess during busy times, they just half cook the chicken and send it out quickly. Super bloody inside. It was even cold to the touch. Didn't directly bring this up to Hooters because I am leaving soon (plus postmates refunded me) but just a heads up for anyone ordering during rush hour."}
{"text":"Great wings, cold beer, pretty girls enough said !!!"}
{"text":"I would leave zero starts but can't do here is my review. Worst experience of my life. It took 20 min to be seated and there was plenty of open tables. Just no hostess in sight three different people told us they would seat us then disappeared. Finally got a table ordered 4 drinks and 2 apps. Got the apps before our drinks and only got 2 drinks then 5 min later got one more drink then told me they were out of my beer so I ordered a different one out of that too. Should I have been told that from the begging and to get our apps before drinks. So I ordered a Bloody Mary then 20 min went buy 3 empty drinks one empty water cup. We decided it was time to leave. We asked for the check there was drinks on there we never got. When we got that fixed and ready to go the waitress then offered us our wings after an hour of wait time no thanks something should be done."}
{"text":"Wings are wings nothing special, but sports, attractive woman, and cold beer makes this a spot I gladly would return to."}
{"text":"Hostesses tonight are rude. Unhelpful - \"you can check\" if there's indoor seating. What? Isn't that your job as the hostess?  Decide to sit outside - there are 3 of us and don't need to take up a huge seating area for 8 so we asked if we could separate tables. Literally blank stares. This is not challenging! We've been here for 15 minutes and have had no service. What is happening??  Update: Moved inside. Waitress is super nice. However, tiniest nugget of chicken on a slider. How do you put out a ketchup bottle that's not ready to use?!"}
{"text":"Servers and bartenders are friendly and attentive. I have been to this location a few times and it is a bit inconsistent. Tonight we ordered to go. The wings were wrong and our other items got cold as we waited for the wings to be redone. We were there a total of an hour for a takeout order. Manager was great and made it all right but it was far too long. I'll be back but this is not the best location."}
{"text":"Went to Hooters to watch the Celtics win! :) Our waitress was pretty good but nothing great in terms of service and overall attitude. The beer was cold but they don't serve beer in bottles?!?! They only serve bottled beer in the aluminum \"bottles\" which definitely keeps me from going back."}
{"text":"I wanted to order a salad to go one afternoon, I was close to this location, and I thought, \"why not, I've enjoyed the salad at hooters before.\"   I felt like ordering the Fried Chicken salad, but I wanted a little kick to it, so I was going to ask to make my chicken spicy. Other locations have done this for me before so I didn't think it was going to be an issue. When I called to place my order, I asked for the Fried chicken salad, and stated that I wanted my chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. The girl on the phone told me that I couldn't do that, but that they have a buffalo chicken salad. I specified that I didn't want the ingredients in the buffalo salad, and preferred the fried chicken salad but with my chicken spicy. Again I was told that I couldn't do that. So I resolved to order the fried chicken salad but with the chicken normal. Ok whatever.  Note to hooters: when your guest asks for something that can be done, do it. Its a way to get repeat business. Not to mention when I tried to call again to place a to go order, no one answered the phone. Twice. I mean really?  My vote: Skip it. Or at least try another location where they pretend to actually care for the needs of the customer."}
{"text":"Visited this place one time last year, since it was right next to my previous job. Being new to the hooters community as this was my first time, and last, trying this franchise, I can understand the whole hype behind it. However, if we rate this place based on food and service quality, it probably scores anywhere between 0-1 out of 5!!  It's located very close to the airport, with billboard signs and heavy advertising. The restaurant is fairly big, but the one time I went it was almost empty with a couple of tables only. Service is below average, no experience what-so-ever, at least for the two servers that were taking over our table. Management was around, but not checking on tables or anything... Food quality and taste are something you'd find at a regular pub, with no flavours or identity! Unfortunately, a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Wouldn't know how the food tasted like because no one came to serve us. Completely intolerable, we saw three waitresses talk to the manager who didn't do anything about it. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Wish they had better service I had a appetizer along with wings I was at the bar though it was not consuming alcohol and this seemed to be a big factor I told my waitress that my beverage was flat tasting and she would get me another one. that was all I saw two cokes touring wings and appetizer $35 by a store later how come they couldn't get me another beverage that was named flat tasting she said it was because I was not consuming alcohol or gaming I might not be back here for a while"}
{"text":"Service was pretty attentive. The food wasn't as good as the typical Hooters experience. Wings were huge, too big in a steroid kind of way.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here. Honestly it might be the worst experience I've ever had dining out. First we waited a hour and a half for food and we had a party of 8. She forgot 2 peoples orders. Waitress kalie. She didn't even apologize or show any type of urgency to correct her mistakes. As soon as we were sat we ordered drinks and shots which we didn't receive for almost 25 minutes. Again she only brought half of what we ordered. I will never go back to this location again. She's showed no care in the world for the mistakes and the time she wasted. Not to mentions before e were sat we waited outside for 1 hour. So we spent a total of 3 hours here and I didn't receive my food till 2 hours in since she forgot to put. Will s can you please message me"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Hooters on the night in question. I hadn't been to a Hooters Restaurant in probably 12 years or so. The wings were pretty good and judging by the looks of the food that everyone else had ordered the menu seems to be alright.   This probably would have been a 4-star experience but unfortunately two things stood in the way. The first was that Hooters generally only has crap beer on tap; not really the fault of this particular restaurant since they don't have control over the beer selection. The second was that our waitress needed an attitude adjustment. She made a few snarky remarks when we were ordering when half of our group wasn't really paying attention.  Meh. I'll probably come back here some time, but it's not on my priority list."}
{"text":"I would have love to give a better rating, but I just can't! I order food around 5 in the morning. Sadly my bad I should have check it before heading to my room. Get to my room an i open up the box. Well it wasn't what I order! So I figure get some sleep an just return it in the morning. Well when I go to return it I'm told no they can't do it an that it wasn't open for debate... I had the full box of food as well the receipt! So in some senses you guys stole from me! It's not like I came down with a sandwich with one bite in it! Lol! Full box full of everything! So unless I get my 13.52 back I can't give you a different review! Fyi folks tired or not walk back down an handle it then an either wait another 10-15 minutes for a remake or however long for a refund"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here, and I waited 20 minutes and not one waitress came to our table. One of my friends had to go ask the hostess where our waitress was before she came by. I didn't order anything because I didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes for a beer. This was the first and last time I come here."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  I had to wait a long time just to get a server and the good came out even slower with hardly anybody in the restaurant."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience at the restaurant. Not sure if it's my skin color but this is becoming more and more common! Jen the waitress who was in at around 530pm is the absolute worse! Complained about getting sat back to back but isn't that how you make your money?! I will never ever be back to this place and advise you not to even waste your time if your non white. Not trying to make everything a race issue but not sure what else it could be as the white couple who came in 15 mins after us had superb service and food in less than 10 mins. Jen need to be retrained asap! You missed out on a great customer..."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST EXPERIENCE. I do love Hooters Wings, but won't EVERRR GO BACK HERE. Extremely EXHAUSTED I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE HOOTERS RESTAURANT. Unbeknownst to me it takes over 45 mins to get a 10 pc wings to go. So I thought. After waiting over 40 mins while sitting at the bar, I asked the hostess \"does it normally take this long?\". She replied \"what did you have?\" I stated a 10 pc Hot. She turned grab a bag and said \"well we didn't know where you went\"........ ummmmmm at the same bar you brought my water and receipt to. ON THE SAME CHAIR!!!!!!   I asked for the Manager and Mikey comes up and immediately starts to explain how long the wings take.......I'm looking really puzzled now. I'm focused on the customer service aspect of being notified that my order was ready then handed a bag with cold wings. I verrrrrryyyyyyy calmly stated Mikey I'm simply providing feedback on my experience and food takes time to cook I understand that, HOWEVER BETTER POLICIES SHOULD BE IN PLACE IN REGARDS TO YOUR TO-GO CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.... Here for 2 hours...AYCE WINGS MY ARSE.. BEEN HERE had 10 wings in two hours... Sad service...complained to management.. And still waiting... Not even busy...they don't care... Worst service ever....."}
{"text":"I live next door now and I go often...there's this younger looking guy who usually always waits on me...for some reason I never get served by the babes....so so weird.....anyway I'm in love with the breaded wings, picked and I don't think the buffalo chicken dip is on the menu but I'm in love with it...... I wish I knew the young guys name who always waits on me cause he's great!   He looks 17 he's got olive skin, dark hair, dark eyes...gentle voice.... He does a great job waiting on the patrons when the girls are busy smoozing with men and gamers...I work in the industry so I understand the game .... But I'll def be a repeat patron... I'm gonna get so fat eating here a few times a week!!!!"}
{"text":"Ill give it three stars because the food was delicious! but the service is kind of slow and the girls aint as nice as other hooters. with nice i mean gentle and customer serviceable. they seem like they are fatigued or tired or even lazy.  plus not all of them our hooters material if u know what i mean. at the end i wanted to buy some hooters gear and they didnt even knew prices. i also found a hot chick. the only one and took a picture. thats the reason ill give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place!! open patio seating with shade good looking girls, Gaming ,great bar service & food.. And a stage for live music... I just wish I had a hooters on my side of town.."}
{"text":"Dropped by Hooters today (9/3/15) for some breaded wings and was totally disappointed for the first time at Hooters. We have always rated their breaded wings as being rather good. Maybe the cook/cooks was having a tough day. The wings was either fried twice or they was left to cook for an extra 20 minutes,dry as hell no moisture at all. they were rock hard almost inedible. the doggy bag was truly for the doggies. we also ordered onion rings another mistake. we haven't eaten at Hooters in awhile and it just might be a long while before we try it again. Next time we want wings it will be The Chicken Shack in Henderson, which was my wife's first choice. Looking back at the situation we should have sent them back to the cook they were that bad."}
{"text":"Extremely convenient if staying across the street at the Marriott.    However the personality of the staff is probably the worst I've ever witnessed. Sat at the bar to watch the bowl games also sat with an empty glass for a good twelve minutes before it was refilled. Ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which I haven't had in years. Took 23 minutes for the food to arrive, it looks like only the manager was in the kitchen, didn't see a single cook other than him. Still if that's the case make it aware to the guest who haven't eaten all day. After the food eventually came out my chicken had not been cooked all the way and extremely raw in the middle. I asked to see the manager( who cooked it) he looked as if he had no sorrow and could have cared less. Been to many hooters and used to work for one and never had been so displeased with my visit I know this is not how they typically run something needs to be addressed because this place is a train wreck!!!!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located by tye pool area. And is Way cheaper than the pool bar. Plus Autumn really did a good job serving us. She's really cool too."}
{"text":"Very personable staff, but slow. Their cellphones are very important to them.  The food wasn't anything to write home about, overly greasy and not at all fresh.   I have never had a problem with their fries, but today they were not crispy, but super soggy. NOT good. I had a sandwich, and my meal-mate had wings. Neither of us were happy and will not be back."}
{"text":"Wings are too small for a meat lover! Not even the regular chicken wing size. I got 10 wings for 11.99, and packed them home. The creamy garlic galore was good but be careful about the size!!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place -stars. I'm so glad I finally have the time to review this place. Lemme tell you why I will never come here again....Caitlyn H*y*s.   Dear Caitlyn, You are a rude ass C***. You were too lazy to get yourself off your stool to seat us, and when you did you walked over to the table without even acknowledging us, so that is why we did not follow you. A nice \"follow me this way\" would have been appreciated. We both know you use your mouth from the looks of it.. instead of using it for God knows what, use your words. But no she used her head and pointed it toward us then the table. So, we walked over to the table to meet you, and you greeted us with our menu's and a nice rolling of your eyes. Great touch, hooters had taught you well.   Dear Hooters, Caitlyn, needs to be fired, or retrained. I was really looking forward to the wings and the beer and I got neither. Instead I got a rude awakening of what your restaurant has to offer. I will never be coming back.  Side note, I was with my friend, her family which included her dad, her husband and her two kids under 10. We would have ordered a lot and tipped well. Your loss. If you guys see Caitlyn, I hope you get a better experience than we did!"}
{"text":"Seriously. Standing here waiting on 20 wings to go for 30 minutes. Place is dead and servers seem totally disinterested in interacting with customers.  Ill never come back to a hooters again."}
{"text":"We absolutely love their wings and onion ring tower! Always consistently good. The service has always been good too and I like how the manager is interactive with your table always checking to see how everything is. I like how the servers write their names on the napkins! Nice and clean restaurant and bathrooms! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Hooter's!!!! No, no, not the restaurant...it's really not the best dining experience, from a \"good food\" perspective.  Mr. Hooter founded his establishment (Hooter's) on the premise that a few chickens losing their wings so that we can happily dine on them and wash them down with beer is a good thing:) It probably is a good thing (chickens don't really need their wings...even the free range clucker's can't fly:), things are just not particularly well executed at Hooters.  Maybe it's the boobs who bought the place from Mr. Hooter that aren't living up to expectations. Still, the patrons were at Hooter's in force yesterday afternoon. What keeps them coming in droves? There must be something that keeps the clients (erstwhile diners?) coming in...could it be the charitable causes (I surmised that it's something about saving owls) that Mr. Hooter supported? I understand that Hooter's is all about support! Maybe it's the extraordinarily loud, yet incomprehensible music coming from the mis-synchronized speakers dotting the ceiling of Hooter's. I did notice that servers (all of whom seem to be young ladies in the full bloom of young lady-hood) all seem to kind of \"groove\" to the music, so they must like it:) Maybe it's the comforting bosom of Hooter's \"sports bar\" décor (funny signs, racks and racks of sports memorabilia, posters, etc., on the walls) that the Hooters client base yearns for. Nice artwork! Hard to say. I did notice that most of the diners were male, mid 30's to 60's and just sort of stared, glassy eyed (at the servers, not the food). That may help explain things. The Beautiful Carin called, out of the blue, and asked me out for lunch today:) What a nice surprise for me:) It was a perfect day for lunch, because I was ready to get out of the office for a while and see my girl. She suggested Hooter's (yeah, that's right...it wasn't me! :) We hadn't been to one for years, so we gave it a try.  She had a Cobb Salad with Chicken Breasts and I had a Chicken Breast Sandwich with a side of fried pickles (I have a Norwegian heritage...we never saw a vegetable or fruit that we didn't want to fry, boil, bake or distill:) It's funny that we both ordered something with Breasts...must have been \"in the air\". It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good...mediocre, pedestrian, ordinary are words that come to mind.  Even the pickles, which I had been wanting for a while. However, inexpensive is not a word that comes to mind...$36 for salad, sandwich, pickles and iced tea! I think we must be paying for ambiance.  I Love Hooter's!!!!! No, not the restaurant:)"}
{"text":"I always wanted to come eat here people made it seem it was a really good place until tonight I came with my friends who never came to this place either. Our food was apart 15mins. Our waitress Kelly was so rude to us rolling her eyes at us. She would take so long (20mins) for us to get refill. She wouldn't pass by our table to check if we needed something our food was already cold by the time she would come. I saw her in the kitchen counter  sitting down where they put food on ??? I don't think that's sanitary at all I was disgusted. Her reaction when she saw me looking at her felt like she didn't even care about her job. She just smeared.  I never experienced service like that in my life neither did my friends. Plus the food there was horrible. Never in my life going to a place like this who have people like that waitressing."}
{"text":"The girls who work here are not nice. And their serving/ bartending skills are bad. They need to start hiring girl with more experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and all was fine. Went with the onion tower, spicy shrimp and fried pickles. The spicy shrimp were delicious and so were the wings we ordered.  Our server was trying her best to be attentive but with a large table next to us they kept her busy. The wings took longer then expected and with a not so busy place I just wonder how long must someone wait to have their wings.  Anyways, we were across the street at the Sheraton so this place was ideal for us."}
{"text":"This was not a pleasant experience, Firstly, I had fried pickles, which were soggy and greasy, nowhere near as good as I have come to expect from Hooters. The bartender (Jennifer), while not unpleasant to look at, was extremely slow. She walked past my empty beer glass all night; the only way I was able to get a beer was to get her attention, which was difficult, since she was busy fooling around with her phone and doing God knows what else, and ask her point blank for a beer. When I was able to finally order an entree, she recommended at \"Daytona\" sauce, which was goopy, sickly sweet, and horrible.  The worst, and unforgiveable part, was that there was a mix-up with the tabs, and the manager came over and informed me that I could order no more alcohol, since I had already has TEN beers. I had NOT had ten beers; believe me, if I had wanted to have ten beers, it would have been impossible in the short time I was there, with the inattentive bartender. Rather than argue with these socially-inept , inefficient people, I cashed out and left. have reasonable expectations, and not only did they not meet my expectations, they were egg\regiously insulting. I come to town often, for business, and could potentially bring a lot of business, as my customers do like Hooters, but I will NOT be back here, Steer clear of this place. Go to the Texas Steak House or one of the other numerous nearby options."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's a Hooters - how can you not have fun with it?  Granted, my expectations weren't super high, I've been to other locations and they've always been consistent.  And sure enough - the Arizona Center location did not disappoint.  We were in a group of about twelve, and we all ordered beers and food before going to a movie.  Service was great - (reading other reviews - we may have just been lucky) but seriously everyone was friendly and prompt.  We had multiple servers helping us since our party was large.  My fiance and I ordered a couple of beers (domestics of course, but we made do) and their famous wings.  I ordered two that were the hottest level of spice they came in.  Honestly - they weren't hot at all to me but my fiance must constantly remind me of my lack of taste buds (I recently took on the infamous ghost chili and won - but that is a story for another time).  Everyone at the table thought they were spicy, so order with caution.  We ordered them Daytona style - which means they were grilled - and they were yummy.   The girls were of course pretty!  ;)  They even sang happy bday to our two buddies - who had the biggest smiles on their faces EVER!  The negative to this particular Hooters is the location itself.  The Arizona Center becomes a ghost town at night - and parking in the lot is tricky.  Even with validation you still have to pay after a certain amount of time passes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled - but when I go out to dinner or a bar I don't like having to pay for parking.  It's not like we're in New York or San Francisco!    Regardless - parking issues aside - a really fun time with a good group of friends.  A good spot to hit before a movie or another bar!"}
{"text":"Hooters wings are practically the same everywhere and I have to say that no one can do 'breaded' like they do. I want meh some crispiness and boy, do they cater. Other than that though, this hooters has nothing special about it other than the fact that it is on Mill and convenient when you're balls to the wall drunk.  I went on a Wednesday night with a group of friends and the food came out in a reasonable time.   When I say reasonable, only if they were waiting in the kitchen for the actual egg to hatch, then wait for the baby chick to grow until it's an adult, de-feather it, and fry it fresh. This is how it felt waiting for our food and by the time the food actually came to the table, all the server AND the manager could keep repeating was 'we're on last call and about to close, do you want anything else?\"   Well damn son, I just got my food and it's not our fault we had to wait until closing for our food to be ready.   A lot of the people I went with had to get up and go to the bar just to ask for water to be refilled because the server was so boggled and non-existent. Plates, drinks, utensils, nothing was ever given when asked even though we asked our server. I asked her for a box 3 times and she acknowledged but never came back once with it. This 'Styrofoam contraption'  was too hard for her to comprehend so I finally had to go searching for one on my own.   Two stars for the usual good wings, but nothing else for the non-existent service."}
{"text":"So the other night a group of friends and I were downtown and wanted to grab a bite and have a few beers.  Hooters was nearby so we all agreed to go.  I had never been to Hooters prior to this and being a 22 year old male I thought this was unacceptable.  I needed to see what all the hype I was hearing the last 10 years was all about.  So I don't know if it was just a bad night to go on (Saturday night???) but the waitresses were NOT hot.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I love to see some ass sticking out but do the shorts really have to go all the way to their shoulder blades?  Yeah sure, maybe its like a retro 70's style but if I wanted to go to a disco I would go across the street to the Ballroom for some Disco Bowling.  Anyways, the girl serving us was decent but was not friendly whatsoever, not exactly helping my Hooter's experience.  We got our food and started eating.  The food was decent, but really nothing special.  I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which was ok but the chicken was like 2 inches thick and unlike the girls who work there, I am not used to opening my mouth that wide.  There was a Leaf's game on at the time and I was watching it on the wall behind the table in front of me.  Unfortunately, I was constantly distracted by the waitress at the table in front of me.  If you think she was super hot, then you haven't been paying attention to my writing.  This waitress had the BIGGEST ASS I have ever seen.  Honestly, it was the size of Jupiter.  Have you ever seen something so shocking that you can't stop staring?  Yeah, that was it.  And the booty shorts and ass flopping out didn't help.  I would like to digress for a second.  I have nothing against big girls, I really don't.  But when you go to a bar that is supposed to be filled with hot girls, then you have some sort of expectation.  One thing you don't expect is a big girl with a Queen Latifah booty, wearing retro-cut booty shorts.  Anyways, it was a distraction and uncalled for.  Suffice to say, Hooter's is not the place for me.  If you wan't to go to a bar with really hot waitresses, I strongly suggest Moxy's.  And while they won't be wearing retro booty shorts that go up to their nose, at least I can guarantee you that they will be super hot and for the most part friendly.  Oh yeah, and while I was there I saw two guys, about 15 years old, just chilling and sipping on their cokes.  Their wide eyes and smiles as they looked around said it all."}
{"text":"It's your typical Hooters, just a slightly bit more expensive. Since it is in a casino, you should come go expect that. The foods is as good as any other Hooters I had been to and the service was fine. Jerica behind the bar was friendly"}
{"text":"This location has been here for more than 20 years. Yes..that long. I now work around this location and have come here for lunch a few times. The wings are not that bad. We usually order breaded, hot, and get a side of curly fries. I wish the fries where curlier. It is definitely a chain type restaurant and not bad for a quick lunch. I have also ordered their buffalo chicken salad. They got the buffalo chicken done right, but the salad looked sad and brown. I'll still come back since this is the only wing place close to the office."}
{"text":"Food was good. Got a surprisingly fast service, from ordering to getting the food to the table. Waitress was attentive. 2 comments:  first, server moved too fast .. before finishing the order she was gone and I had to call her back. ( twice ) 2nd, the floor and place isn't that clean. When you sit to eat and the table next to you been cleaned by wiping whatever on top to the floor it's not that pleasant, especially since its stayed like that after I was done and leaving"}
{"text":"This is my spot! I love it even though there aren't any chicks on the graveyard shift when I finish at work. In all honesty Hooters Girls are just annoying unless you're a horny old man looking for female companionship but too cheap to pay for a hooker.   This is a kick ass gaming bar and the bar staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the grand opening tonight. It was nice, but nothing particularly stand out special about it. Not bad, just not wow. Lot's of tv's for sport's bar viewing. A half indoor/outdoor room where smoking is allowed since it is on an Indian reservation. I really like the roll up windows so we can enjoy our great weather. I hope to come back for happy hour soon and re-review."}
{"text":"This review should focus strictly on bartender/server Vanessa! She is awesome and a fantastic person to be serving/bartending. In the course of an hour she's checked on me multiple times and with a smile. Big difference from my previous visits! Happy hour works and I like to catch up on sports here. I waited 10 mins for a drink order so they gave nearly a double. My favorite is still in DTLA across from staples center but for Vegas this bar is better than the casino. Check it out, especially if you're a local too!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place recently and thought I was entering an Exotice Bird Rescue. I wasn't  planning on buying an Owl that day, but when I saw a sign that read: Hooters, I decide to atleast check these animals out. To my suprise, it was not a wildlife rescue.  It's actually a sports bar with claddly dressed women.  Service was awesome, the beer was cold, and the food was hot. (No Owl is on the menu, which makes me happy)  Fun place to hang out, all the girls are super nice and outgoing. Great wrap around bar with plenty of seats.  If Bryanna or Rachael are behind the bar, you'll be in good hands."}
{"text":"Since apparently it's the only place uptown that has the Saturday night fights, we checked into Hooters for a few drinks and little UFC...   This was not my first trip to a Hooters, but my first time to this location, though really - what's the difference? Girls in unflattering outfits (yes, some pull it off, but a lot do not), sub par food, odd amounts of parents with their children, and enough liquor to quench your thirst.   We were seated near plenty of TVs, ordered our drinks and everything seemed fine. We were checked on just enough (every time our drinks hit 2/3 empty) and from what I could tell, it was going to be a decent few hours even though out of every corner of my eye I could see a child squirming around in their chair. Then, there was the shift change... new waitress, new division of tables, and adios decent service! I could catch glimpses of her bleached hair, but could never make eye contact so our drinks sat empty, and then we had to wait forever for the check, and then even longer for her to come back with my card... I would have been a little more understanding if they were slammed, but for a bar uptown on a Saturday night, they weren't even close.  If I ever find myself in this Hooters again, I'm going to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service by the manager. We came here to celebrate my 19 year old nephews birthday. There were folks on the patio smoking so much that it came into the restaurant. We asked if they could shut the door to the outside patio and he said no they have customers. I said then what are we?? We have to suffer through smelling smoke while trying to eat? We ended up leaving and eating outside in the truck away from the smoke. Horrible service where they would only accommodate one set of customers! Never again will I eat at this trashy place. If I could give a zero or negative score I absolutely would. Pieces of shit!!....then my nephew goes back in to use the restroom and the trashy waitress wants to talk shit about is complaining about the smoke and not tripping her stupid ass."}
{"text":"Hands down worst service ever. Close this location. Still waiting on food. Where are my wings?? I'll never know.  Update 5 days later. Still waiting on my wings. Update 10 days later. Got a call, oops sorrey, wrong number. Still waiting... Update 1 year later. You'll never guess, they ran out of wings. #sorrey"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and enjoy the....the....the....the... chicken wings. Great atmosphere and good wings.. not to mention the assume service by some great servers."}
{"text":"Horrible!!  I took my bf here last night for his birthday and this place was bad!  I proceeded to tell our bar tender it was his birthday as she cards him and verifies.  We ordered wings Daytona style which were a hard rubbery mess with some crunchy balls mixed in of chicken and the fried pickles were the bottom of the barrel such tiny pieces.  But our bartender made sure she came to close out our tab to get her tip before she went home during our time there.  Never again.  Thought they would at least sing my bf happy birthday....NOPE.  not even a desert or a B-Day drink.  And a bill for 67.00!  Do yourself a favor don't go here.  Do buffalo wild wings.  Service is much better and is the food.  Hooters is really going down hill from how it was years ago.  It's ashame,  it used to take pride in its restaurants and customer service. I was in here a few months ago as well and was ignored at the bar while all the servers sat and socialized in the corner.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible service, untrained staff, fake personalities, oh my! You'd think one lives in Vegas or something.. oh wait.   Went here on a Sat afternoon (Aug 22nd) and I hadn't been to a Hooters in a very long time ever since the one near me in Sunset Station closed (terrible leadership decision there). Anyways, you used to goto Hooters for the atmosphere and wings. Now, I'm not really sure why anyone with more than two brain cells would eat, let alone work here.  Service was just, bad. Bad, bad, bad. I sat at the bar which was DEAD, customers wise. Nobody around to talk to at all would make anyone observant enough to notice and think, \"Hmm, I work here and I'm supposed to be friendly and cute to customers, maybe I should engage with this person for small talk!\" Nope. Not one girl came over to ask how I am while alone at the bar munching on my wings. That's just really weird for a place like this.   I ordered the original 10-piece and curly fries. When my food was brought out it was basically slapped down and the waitress walked off never to return. No, I didn't need ketchup, extra napkins or anything else hun.. why bother asking like any professional waitress would? I had to get up from my chair and walk over to grab some condiments and paper towels down the bar. And, what the hell happened to the wet naps they used to give out? Those don't exist anymore?   The wings were, meh. Some were overcooked, while a few of the drumsticks were undercooked with that nasty slimy taste. The curly fries were way too salted for my taste.  While looking around the bar I couldn't help but notice how dirty it was too. I never saw one girl wipe anything down. No pride in their work areas, but they sure do have some HUGE bedazzled purses stuffed under the bar area in plain view.  I had my debit card out and was ready to leave before anyone even came to pick up the plates. Guess I'm too old or expect too much from a place like this nowadays. Yes, it might be in a nicer area of Vegas, but God it's ran so ghetto."}
{"text":"I've always been mystified by the concept of this restaurant. Is it flat-out kitsch or an earnest attempt to add a smidge of sex appeal to an otherwise underwhelming casual-dining restaurant? Is this some Protestant alternative to a peeler bar or is this just a soft-softcore non-stripclub with a better spread and free refills on pop?  Now, tackling the above points is beyond the scope of this essay (THE key line in about every paper I wrote in university) but I'll try anyway. It seems to me that Hooters exists in a completely different plane of existence. Let's call it \"1983.\" The PE uniforms that the servers wear here consist of a tight white tank top and highwaisted shorts. On weekends they go \"formal\" and dress in black. I'm sure with the appropriate eye makeup and Aquanet, this aesthteic melted the chinos off some Devo loving yuppie -- thirty years ago. I can't believe in all this time they have not updated their look.  Fine, you don't need convincing to visit a place where ogling the wait-staff is de rigueur. Is the food any good? Kind of. The oft-touted wings are tasty, but very greasy. I can't properly recommend anything else on the menu.  For both wings and scantily clad femmes you can do better in Toronto (heck, just visit Jack's up the street). But if you are hankering for a timewarp with wholly-disinterested girls, mediocre food and the aura of Reagan's USA.... what's wrong with you?  Obligatory Title Pun: Give a HOOT, don't come here.  Menu Readability: Could a company have a worse logo? It's not just MS clip art, it's ACTUAL clip art.  Need to mention: Devo is pretty dope actually. Oh, and the rooftop patio is too. I'll give it an extra star for that.  What this place teaches me about myself: My feminist days are numbered if I keep showing up at this place."}
{"text":"Loved the view on the rooftop patio! The best spot to eat at this restaurant, especially if the weather is nice.   The chicken strip cheese sandwich is a must try at this place. It tasted amazing!! However, the wings.. Not so much. Hardly any meat on them, so I don't recommend it!   However, 3 stars, because the service was super slow. There were only 3 tables filled with either two or three people and there were four waitresses on the patio.. Didn't understand why the service was so slow.   Other than that, the view/location and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I always have a great time and great experience at Hooters, BUT tonight the Manager while I was outside on the phone talking to work, came and cleared my table, and I was in middle of eating when I stepped out to take phone call from work. What's insane is when I walked back in to sit back down the Hostess was about to sit someone there and I hadn't even paid. Horrible Management Move, but other then that the staff was awesome well everyone but the manager and she is reason for one star! ( here's some advice to that manager make sure your tables for sure left and aren't on phone outside or in restroom before you kick them out or make them fill like crap as you have me)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Arrived on a Tuesday night. My friend arrived before me and she waited to be helped when she walked in as she wasn't sure if she should seat herself or wait to be seated. The guy who appeared to be a manager (shorts and a baseball cap) walked by and ignored her twice before finally asking if she needed help. (The rest of our visit he did a whole lot of nothing standing on the patio. Wait, I take that back. I saw him pour one beer.) I arrive about 10 minutes later and join my friend who is sitting outside. She has a beer she ordered, and I wait for a waitress to come and take my order. She shows up about five minutes later,  I order a beer, and we place a food order. I sit waiting for my beer, and nothing. I look over to see our waitress talking to her fellow workers at the front of the restaurant. There are about four of them with a couple of them sitting on the counter by the front door. Thank goodness they don't serve food on that counter!  I wait a few more minutes, cutting her some slack, when I finally get up and walk inside. I ask her from the door if I can get my beer. They all look at me like I am a freakin alien or something. My waitress finally comes forward and I ask again if I can get my beer. She has a confused look on her face until it dawns on her that I ordered a beer. She repeats what I ordered and says she'll go get it. A couple of minutes later a different girl brings my beer. The food arrives and is fine. You can't really screw up a chicken sandwich and fried pickles. We were there a little over an hour and she checked on us once. (they weren't busy) So much for a second beer for me. We asked for the check, and it took 10 minutes for her to come back and collect  it. On top of her being a bad waitress, she had the personality of a door. Didn't smile once, and looked like she hated her job. Seriously doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am impressed with this Hooters. I stopped by for a late lunch about a week ago. The waitress promptly greeted me and escorted me to a table. I ordered a beer and a Big Hootie platter.  She came back with the beer, which was frosty cold and good. The food came back about 12 minutes later. The burger and fries were delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday night football and Thursday night football.  Both times were excellent.  1st off the food was actually amazing.  If you've ate at hooters before you should know the food here but everything tasted freshly made the wings and fries.  Also the beer was fresh and our area was clean.  Looking at some of the reviews I think guys have a set perception the girls here are suppose to flirt with them and kiss their ass...Thats not the case here.  All the ladies I felt with were professional and as long as you are courteous an nice they will be too.  I don't expect them to call me sweetie or any B.S. like that.  Most of the girls are super young like 18-22...  Most are beautiful of course and the bartenders are the same!  There are two really big screens to view with other televisions around the eating area.  This is the biggest hooters restaurant from what they say.  I had a great experience here so five stars from me!  ;)"}
{"text":"Service is awful.  Took a half hour before someone finally served me then it took another 20 minutes to get one drink.  Yikes."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of my buddies. We sat down outside and it was very dusty and dirty. No one served us so we moved inside. Still, no service so we finally left. There is a reason Hooters is getting beat out by places like Twin Peaks and Tilted Kilt.  Also, with so much competition nearby- Buffalo Wild Wings, Native New Yorker, Texas Roadhouse, etc, Hooters need to learn basic restaurant procedures like \"serving customers.\"  Prediction: this place will be gone in 6 months."}
{"text":"I must be in an odd mode nowadays going to places like this but...I did it, so lets listen to my experience, yea?  Well, I came to eat obviously. I got food. And the food was good, fried pickles, celery sticks, and but of course wings! Yay! Waitress was nice and drew a heart and wrote XOXO on our bill...I will scan this to show proof, it was cute and funny, if you looked at it that way...   I must say, I could see myself revisiting Hooter's, maybe not this location in particular, but in Vegas or elsewhere, def. And I would probably go in the evening with a bunch of guys, because during the day it was kinda drab. Plenty of screens to watch the game or games on. Spacious patio and a bar. Kinda reminded me of a confused T.G.I.Friday's.   Oh and I don't know if it was something special today, but all the girls were wearing black, instead of the infamous orange and white...I was very confused by this, but dared not to ask..."}
{"text":"Just awful service, sat outside the patio and waitress acknowledged us by giving us menus. Waited for at least 15 minutes and than another couple sat at the patio and got served within 2 minutes. Walked out, not bothering with that type of service."}
{"text":"Host and servers are friendly but not the best looking that I've seen.   Food needs work. Buffalo shrimp - batter falling off means they did it wrong Hooters inconsistent menu and names of flavors are poor. 911 are Bentley in Texas, but something else in Canada and Florida. And the heat index is a joke. I had to add hot sauce onto their 911 wings. Bunch of babies in Canada."}
{"text":"I LOVE Hooters wings.  I love the buttery hot original sauce, the light coating of flour and the large size of wings.  We had been eating healthy for awhile and since we were at Great Wolf Lodge decided we needed adult beverage and food.  So we ordered 20 wings and curly fries to go.  When my husband arrived the wings were THICKly coated in hard flour.  They tasted like old oil.  The sauce was pooled at the bottom and not on the wings.  The sauce was really dark not that golden orange sauce I remembered.  Even the curly fries were not right.  They were dry and tasteless.  I had to peel all the coating off the wings before I could even eat them.  I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm extremely critical when it comes to hooters. I've had good and bad experiences   Mostly bad. But today was great Lauren was our server and she was phenomenal  I would recommend this hooters to everyone in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"We stopped in after Bon Jovi concert this past Saturday. What a huge mistake!  We were seated quickly and then completely ignored for 15 minutes-a server came asking what we'd like to drink. We said we need menu to see what had on tap-never saw them again. We waited an additional 10 minutes and left. Several people in hooters attire appeared to be walking around looking so busy, but I saw no food or drinks being served to anyone. The bartender was working her ass off serving those at the bar-that's it. We headed for the door and we're asked on our way out \"did your server not come?\"   Place is a real joke! NEVER again."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here before a show for a drink. That was a big mistake. The bartender was extremely slow, couldn't remember our beer orders after telling her three times (and they were the same beer for both my wife and I), and the restaurant / bar itself was one of the most boring Hooters I've ever seen. It also didn't help that our bill was over $17 for two poorly poured pints of domestic beer. There are plenty of others places in the Palms to get a decent beer, at a decent price, with good service. We certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for awesome wings and ice cold beer, check out Hooters of Concord.  This restaurant chain is not as popular as it once was, but the bartender (Marissa) made the trip a pure pleasure!  Marissa is the epitome of the \"girl next door\", a great personality, witty, smart, and pretty.  She should be the new poster girl for Hooters Corporation!  I will definitely stop in again to visit."}
{"text":"These guys are the reason I joined Yelp . I'm visiting Las Vegas and on my first day I misplaced my phone here . 4 hours later it was still there and their staff was awesome and friendly , especially management . Special thanks to Cortney for saving me . Food was great and the Margaritas were great . These guys brought a little home to a vacation . Thanks Hooters @ the Palms"}
{"text":"Stopped in here 30 minutes before closing (I HATE being 'that girl' but we were traveling and staying the night nearby) every employee greeted us with a smile! We ordered a beer and food Togo ... And the bartender Sammi Joe was great!  After being on the road all day and just needing to take a break, I'm very glad this was the place we chose!"}
{"text":"Hooooooterrs, Hooo Hooo Hooters. I love hooters! Reminds me of a motor boating accident had in college! This place is conveniently located right off of 215 and Rainbow. I could consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of hooters and have been to many locations across the country.  Pros: The wait staff is always great. Premises are clean.  Cons: The food here has been a hit and miss at various times I visited this establishment. I will be coming back in hopes of more consistent food."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I asked them to change the tv and the sever came back and said, \"I'm sorry my manager said he can't right now. He's too busy?\" Like what? Then I heard the hostess tell someone a 15-20 minute wait and the restaurant wasn't even full. There are so many empty tables. The staff is really overwhelmed for no reason. The wings are really small. I asked my server if Parmesan garlic wings were wet and she didn't know... Plus the food took forever! My game is over."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about the beer at Hooters.  It is always SO freaking cold!  I like that this location is in a casino, I doubt I would ever go to Hooters otherwise.  We were here during NFL playoffs, so it was pretty packed, although we found a booth right away.  Our server was very nice, however she was a bit difficult to understand.  The thing I hate most is that they don't offer french fries with their sandwiches/burgers.  Come on! Nobody wants potato or macaroni salad, or whatever!  At least give the option to upgrade to fries.  Anyhow, my Mom ordered the bleu cheese burger, which was really good.  I had the flappitizer, which is a small order of 5 wings.  They were really good as well.  I think that the sauce is not hot at all, I have even ordered the 911 and barely noticed any heat.  Oh, and we got fried pickles, which were a daily special and they were really good.  They are pickle slices instead of spears, which made them seem much lighter.  I've been to this Hooters a few times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The chicken wing salad with blue cheese hit the spot. They had continual issues with delivering some sliders. The onion rings were tasty. They ended up removing it from the bill."}
{"text":"I love that it's 24 hours. Great that the bar open mail to the outside patio. Food is well Hooters. Only drawback is the girls are not there 24 hours. But regardless the late night bars gaff is always good service."}
{"text":"I went to order to-go food at the pool side bar after leaving the day party. I received very poor service from Savannah.  The bar had two guests and it took a long time before Savannah came to service us.  I was only ordering food and Savannah asked for ID or she was going to send me to another counter. When I handed her cash for the bill, she did not give me a receipt. After standing for 15 minutes, I asked did she know how much longer it would be. She said a long time. I wanted to wait it out, but after 15 more minutes and no check in with the kitchen, I asked how much longer and she said she did not know. I asked a bar back for a manager to get a refund. The manager came out and said he would check the kitchen for the food and talk to the bartender about the refund. As soon as this happened the food came out. Savannah then went into the drawer, placed the money on the counter, then turned back around to the kiosk.   I did not receive an apology for the inconvenience and went to my room without food I work in the service industry. I have never been in a position where I did not receive a receipt for a to-go order to verify my order, nor have I not received an estimated window of time to receive my food. I, also, have not had a situation where I did not receive an apology for poor service from a manager. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Love Hooters.  HATE this Hooters.  I was all geared up to watch the World Cup finals here with my girl.  We both miss our Hooters in Chicago.  We were really up for it.  The problem is, this Hooters wasn't up for it. The service was HORRIBLE.  The wings were HORRIBLE and so un-Hooters-like.  Whoever was shucking the oysters needs to GO BACK TO OYSTER-SHUCKING-SCHOOL...or leave the restaurant industry all together and work on the BP oil spill clean up.  Lastly, I've been to Hooters all across the country.  And, it's pathetic when Vegas has the worst looking girls of all.  Step it up."}
{"text":"Such bad service here. Stopped by for a beer after work. It was around 6 pm on a Wednesday. Sat at the bar. Bar had 8-10 customers. I sat there for 5 min before anyone acknowledged my existence. Once they did I ordered a beer. Even though I am 50 the girl had to check my ID. Seriously Hooters, can you just train your employees to use common since when asking fo an ID. A blanket policy that you check all ID's is you being lazy in your training program. Well the girl that took my order proceeded to the place she enters orders, tapped a few times on the screen than decided to have a conversation with another girl standing there. After the 3-4 minute conversation she came over to the guy next to me and took his dinner order. Again she went over to the screen to do her tapping. By this point I had been sitting at the bar around 15 min and still did not have a beer. I got up and left. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 6 times. It is hit and miss on the service. As a former manager for hooters, I find the standards are sometimes met and sometimes not. Just because you are a hooter girl, does not mean you automatically deliver great service. You need more than you looks to deliver good service."}
{"text":"The food was good. The only problem I have with coming here is some of the girls think their boobs are a replacement for customer service. If they gave great service along with a nice body, their tips would be amazing."}
{"text":"First time coming here in a few years.  Came with my son and a friend so there was only three of us.  The special on a Tuesday is buy ten traditional wings get ten free and the other special is ayce wings for 19.00. The service was amazingly slow and she only had two tables and we had to wait 25 min until we had to get her attention that we needed refills the problem with the waitress is she was spending too much coins conversing with the other waitress.  The wings also weren't anything like we had before they actually aren't good anymore. Very disappointing won't be coming here anymore just going to stick with b-dubs."}
{"text":"I thought the food was mediocre ..first time eating here was a let down. I was excited to try it but their chicken they used for the boneless wings was dry.. And my quesadilla was something i could have made 10x better at home. Not worth 40$..  The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"It's Hooters as any other. We had an appetizer and some beers before ordering to go. My only beef would have been being charged for ranch when I ordered two sets of wings to go. Struggle with that but wings were good. Enjoyed trying the bacon wrapped wings  it's a good spot for games of course."}
{"text":"A good COLD beer on a HOT day. The wings were good too. The staff was \"talented \"..... and attentive."}
{"text":"I ordered from ubereats fried pickles and curly fries. I gave an instructions to replace the orange sauce for ranch. They sent me NOTHING! I asked them why didnt they send me anything this stupid girl who answered the phone told me I should have ordered it or add it in my order when there is no option that they are selling ranch on the side. She said they just cant replace it so why then they just send me the original sauce they can call the customer support if they cant. I asked if the fries too doesnt come with ranch or even ketchup she said no! What restaurant sells fries that you cant have ketchup?! Too much excuses. You fail customer service from onlie ordering wtf. She  was even the one mad for her excuses. If you hate your job then quit!"}
{"text":"I love Hooters for drinks. They are all kind of the same on food. The wings are good. The waitresses are the real reason to go. This one has really good looking ones for the most part. There are a few fat ones, but that's how it goes. They seem to keep them on the day shift and let the talent work at nights.  Check them out on Wednesdays for 32oz Coors Lights for only 3 bucks. The Smothered Chicken sandwich is delicious. As Hooters restaurants go this one is slightly above average."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, crab legs were great and the managers were very helpful with everything"}
{"text":"Food was OK... But our server Keena made the night. They have so many tvs I could barely look down. I also like how the kitchen is visible to the public."}
{"text":"Not worth the money, all our food was cold and tasted weird. If I could give it no stars, I would. The service sucked for how slow it was and our meal took a while to come out.   Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hello! Hooters! I'm in your restaurant and you'll probably read this before I get asked what I'd like to drink."}
{"text":"There is a Hooters girl by the name of Tracy that works there. Her customer service skills SUCK & she is very rude. I had to ask another Hooters gal to get me a re feel on my drink. Also had to ask another Hooters gal for my check. If you want a great Hooters girl ask for Sarah or Bryanna Both of them have great customer service skill."}
{"text":"Walked in after having pizza at the place next door and was wanting to throw some money away in the machines. REALLY upset to see two bars... one with machines and one with out. Machine bar was full and not more than two people were playing. BYE! Not trying to be the person to force people to move at the bar, the bartenders should address guests NOT gambling and direct them to the other bar and guest NOT gambling should KNOW BETTER than to sit at the gambling side. Will not return."}
{"text":"Lousy service  Preface:  It was a Saturday night, but not even packed. I could understand if it was a huge night and the place is shoulder to shoulder crowded.  But it was not that tonight.   Here we go:   No greetings. No small talk. No personality. The service came only when my beer was low or my check was delivered.   Ordered RANCH with my ten wings & celery - it came with one little side of it. When it went out, I placed the empty container on the bar edge so they could see I would like more - if a server walked near, I'd ask but no one in sight!  Beer is great. Blue Moon with an orange slice. Yum. Maybe I'll have another.   Breaded lemon pepper wings. Yum yum.   TV's are playing UFC fight night. No title on the line, damn this is a good figh-- \"Is it alright we close out your check?\"  \"Sorry, I hate talking with my mouth full. I've run out of ranch, can I have more?\"  \"Sure, we're just switching shifts so we'll bring your check out.\"  There goes that second beer while servers all huddle around counting cash tips.   Conclusion:  Hooters used to have friendly service and a personable staff. The only reason now to go there is for wings and TV's. (+1 star for the massive jumbotron above the bar)"}
{"text":"We love Hooters Wings! Came here for lunch recently and ordered their special buffalo ranch queso dip and chips, barbecue wings,  and my favorite original wings with blue cheese and ranch. We were going to order fries, but my husband had the dip at another location and told me how great it was. We are so glad we stopped by. Everything was so good and our server was very down to earth and attentive. I would've taken a pic of our appetizing wings, but as soon as they arrived we devoured them. Thank you Hooters for a fun and enjoyable atmosphere with delicious eats!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during a conference while I had some time off with a friend.  It was his first trip to Hooters and he loved it.    I had a good time as well.     Good service and good food"}
{"text":"I debated giving it a 4 though.  I just had an epidural and my husband wanted to go there for dinner. I wasn't in the best of moods but our darling and very nice waitress Brittany made it as nice as possible, given how I felt.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich and split some fried pickles with my husband who ate a LOT of wings.  He liked them all and Brittany was great about seeing that he kept getting a fresh hot basket every time (he took the all you can eat).  I honestly think it was a lot better than I had imagined or felt-which wasn't their fault at all"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Turn around! Run!!!  This is the worst Hooters that I have ever been to in my life. I would give a -1 rating if I could. My friends and I went here to grab a bite to eat before going out. I kid you not......it took the waitress 30 minutes to get us water and drinks. We asked for the manager to come over after not receiving our food after about an hour. He implied that he would take care of it. It was not busy, only 4-5 tables were occupied. The manager, Bryan, needs some management skills. He comes back after 1 hour and 15 minutes (still no food) and says that he will take $20 off our bill. $20/4 people= $5 off per person!!! Unacceptable!!!!!   We walk out of restaurant and headed back to the room. Night totally ruined!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is the only Hooters in town. I have never been to Hooters before the other day. We went around 10pm and it wasn't crowded.  We were seated immediately and got to order pretty quickly. I got the Mango Lemonade. It was really good but extremely sweet.  We ordered the fried pickles to share. You can never go wrong with fried pickles. I got 6 wings, in Chipotle Honey and Parmesan Garlic. I loved the Chipotle Honey."}
{"text":"I simply love this Hooters. Leaving my home nest of Montreal for Toronto 3 years ago, I was looking for a place with maternal figures that I could call home - well Hooters is home. Great home style food with even greater service. I love being served by Georgia, Wisconsin, and the rest of the 50 States. Hooters has the best grilled cheese in the World."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. No doubt the food is amazing, but if you it Hooters to find the love of your life, try the one near the Pearson Airport. In my opinion the chicks are hotter there, plus there a stripclub right next door, so you can get even bigger blue balls.  In case you missed my Hooters Airport review, try the grilled cheese, hands down the best in the world."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this chain, but my experience at this particular restaurant was awful. We walked in to an almost empty restaurant, yet still had a very long wait for our waitress. I ordered the classing wings and when the order arrived, there was no sauce on them!?  When I pointed out the error, the waitress said she \"asked the kitchen twice if there was sauce on them...meaning she couldn't tell the difference between plain fried chicken and her restaurant's signature item??  They were courteous in trying to correct the error, but whatever sauce they put on them the second time had neither flavor nor heat. I really do love Hooters' wings, which made this visit particularly disappointing. I will say that management apologized for the disappointing meal, so my issue isn't with management, beyond needing to provide at least one waitress some remedial training."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!  Plan to sit at your table for a WHILE!!  If all Hooters are like this, no wonder they had been closing up.    Came in on Monday Night Football tonight.  They had tables open.  We sat down and waited and waited.  My husband flagged down a waitress who stopped for a second and then walked away.  Flagged down a second waitress who was nice enough to stop and let us know she was going to get someone for us.  Such douchy waitresses.    We have been here before waited and waited.  I hoped that their service would have gotten better.  Guess not.    On a positive note, their wings are always solid."}
{"text":"Service was so slow. Took 30 mins to get an appetizer and drinks. 1.5 hours to get food and when it came it had hair in it. Never again will I be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service & expensive. $13 for 10 wings and no fries????  You can go to Ramsey burgers & get a GREAT burger for $14. Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Food was great, but service was HORRIBLE!  We were immediately seated and our drink order was taken. About 10 mins later our food order was taken. 20 mins goes by, 40 mins goes by and we still don't have our food. People that got here after us were almost done eating before we got our food. Waitress came by and said, \" your food is coming right out\" and I asked why it took so long and she said the TICKET GOT LOST! Now mind you, there was only about 10 tables at the time so she maybe has 2-3 tables as there was five waitresses that I counted. She never came over the tell us there was a delay. I asked to speak with the manager and he did come out and apologize and bought our meal. That's really not what I wanted, but my goodness, that's the least they can do. Will not come back to this location as we have many others options."}
{"text":"It's a chain.  Don't expect more than that. I only come here when I want some sports and have some wings.  Usually by myself and I sit at the bar where I know I can get decent service. When I traveled for worked I had logged in over 35 different locations.  Yes, I have the Certificate showing 25 different locations in 1 year(25th Anniversary Promo). Service was good, but the food was very slow to come out. The wings are a decent size, some of the franchisees use smaller wings. They got my order right, this is a big plus for a Hooters, that's why my wife will not go anymore. This Hooters is pretty good compared to a number I have been to."}
{"text":"Blah! Crappy food, small wings, over priced! Rip off. Complained to corporate and never heard back. Waste of money. Only good thing was our server was nice... Except for tricking us into buying like 5 ranches that ended up costing .99 a piece."}
{"text":"Typical shooters. Music was way too loud. Wait staff sucked too busy huddling in groups applying their lip gloss. Didn't really check in on us too much. Food is over priced for what it was. Ok food but you can get better else where for same value. Your paying for the orange atmosphere there basically. Might go back of in ever bored and can't find anything else to eat in the area spur of the moment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided to stop in for wings, we waited 15 minuets for a waitress  and she never came. I asked her at the hostess stand if someone was serving the section, she said she would be right there. I watched her text on her phone and talk to her co workers and still didn't come by our table. Being a server myself I understand not seeing a customer right away or being busy, but really?  We ended up sitting at the bar and receiving  okay service. The waitress with the short black hair seriously needs to learn some steps of service, for her own good and the restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my last Hooters review. The only reason I'm writing about this one too is the service or shall I say the friendlyness here was left outside the door. With 5 other guys after a Cubs vs. Diamondbacks game and we were respectful but just didn't understand the cold shoulders form these girls. It was awhile ago and I'm sure it's not the same wait staff. I'll give this one another try if I go back and see another Cubs & Diamondbacks game."}
{"text":"The female bartenders today acted like they were new. .they didn't know the flavor wings we requested, they weren't sure if they had Mt Dew. We told them we had a Groupon and immediately she said no we don't have any groupon specials at this location when we just used one last week. .. the worst of it all was she didn't know the Chesapeake dry rub. ..it was disappointing...this was the close to us so we stopped. .next time we will drive further fire Buffalo Wild wings or twin peaks!"}
{"text":"Where do I start.. I have been coming to this Hooters for years now. There hasn't been a time where I have had a bad experience here. The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.  It's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return. I open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about? I read the negative reviews thinking this is not true. I now believe the \"hype\" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.  Honestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.  To simply put it, it is very unlikely that I will return anytime soon. The negative reviews didn't lie."}
{"text":"We decided on Hooters for my Hubby's 33rd birthday. We had a large group and they were able to accommodate us on the patio. It was a beautiful night last night and it was great having so many of our friends there to enjoy food and drinks to celebrate my Husband.   The wings were good & our waitress Lexi was amazing! She was on top of everything and we never had to wait for anything. We had about 6 people at our table. So nothing to complain there, we tipped her nicely too, she had to help out the other table we had in our group who had another 8 people + our table.  That's where the low rating comes in, there was another girl who waited on the table of 8 that was apart of our group. Unfortunately they were left waiting, constantly, all night! We were there from 8:30- close. We felt terrible and while we had great service at our table, our friends who were at the table right next to us waited no less than 45 min for food. We were done eating before they got anything and they ordered right after us. We were actually passing plates of wings over to them because they were all just staring watching us eat... :( They all kept asking to have our waitress and were disappointed & often waiting for new drinks while their's sat empty. It became a topic of conversation because the service was so terrible for them, which was a bummer because they were apart of our group and we just wanted everyone to have a great time and enjoy their food.  We haven't been back since May."}
{"text":"Okay so it's been many year since I came to this hooters location now I know why me and my boyfriend walking in we we're greeted by a very sweet enthusiastic host but once we sat down it was downhill from there the young lady looked like we interrupted her day than brought our drinks I had unsweetened iced tea I asked her for Splenda and she didn't bother to bring it I had to ask someone else than she bring sweet n low umm no than she checks in with us after 3 bites into the meal than no sign of her for the rest of the time I guess running out side to be lifted on hooters event staff guy and snapping pics was more important so ya food was mediocre and I'm being nice so never again"}
{"text":"Great view, but service is too slow even when it has hardly as any customers. I sat down order a drink by the pool and it took over 20 mins before a Hooters Girl asked if was ready to order. I had even get my own menu. At lease the sever could have gave me a menu or something. I'm not coming back here again. I would have gotten expected at lest the same level of service at any other Hooters, or better."}
{"text":"Love this spot. It's never really too busy, but always people here. The drinks are good and it's conveniently located near the epic center/ rail station!"}
{"text":"First I had to ask (felt like pulling teeth from the MALE bartender) if there were any specials.... I'm not sure if its because I was a \"Hooters Girl\" in the buuuut there should NOT be a dude behind the bar........ He was not happy we were here. Didn't want to tell us anything. Told us there were no specials! There forever used to be happy hour from 3-6, this no longer exists not sure if it's just this location!????  Upon getting up and walking out I over heard the hooter girl coming onto shift tell a new customer about there specials... We brought this to her attention but at this point are just upset. We left. Horrible service by Andreas......"}
{"text":"I just went there to have a good time and I was treated badly. The server which I do not recall her name spoke to me like I didn't belong there and did not come to the table for long periods of time. I waited for about half an hour with no service and the place was not busy at all. I complained to the manager which was a nice guy and he offered me $15 off of my next visit. Really! I don't need your money, just fix your attitude and treat your customers well."}
{"text":"So I see that Hooters has went up on the pricing on their wings. what I find interesting is that how can they go up on the price of their chicken wings but the quality of their service has drastically drop down.  Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop any day before I go to a Hooters and pay $15 for 10 wings  3.50 for fries lol that's a rip. And 7.99 boneless Wednesday is now 10.99 boneless Wednesday.  I'm done.  Buffalo Wild Wings and Wing Stop here I come"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience i have ever had! My wife and I love the Buffalo Shrimp, but after today it will be a very long tome before we go back if ever. Customer service was horrible. After waiting for 15minutes in a non busy restuarant it starts to feel like they are ignoring you. My waitress sat at the bar with her friend the whole time we were there. Other waitress's had to come over and bring us our food and once the original girl saw us about to leave she wants to ask \"How was everything?\" and went back over to the bar and sat with her friend. Thats not customer service. I waited almost an Hour for Hot wings and Buffalo Shriimp.  Never again"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to review Hooters but I changed my mind. Our experience here was just too weird.  It was one of those nights where the waitress always pops up at the worst time. We just weren't syncing together, y'know? My girlfriends and I would be emersed in conversation and all of a sudden, \"Sorry but...\" It was one interruption after another. Girl, the tea is good! Leave us alone!  We ordered a wide array of standard Hooters food. The fried pickles were good, the oysters were overpriced and blah in quality, the wings were standard, et cetera. My Moscow Mule was terrible though. Who serves Mules with lemon?!  I didn't tell the waitress I wasn't happy with my Moscow Mule. When she took away my full mug of Mule, she hesitated for a second before walking off. I didn't expect her to take it off the bill because I certainly didn't speak up to her about it but she didn't even ask why it wasn't enjoyed. Bleh!   There are just too many places in town where you can get a much better experience and tastier food. Not today or ever again, Hooters."}
{"text":"Waitress couldn't get anything right. I love the second floor outdoor seating, everything else was terrible."}
{"text":"Shannon's review below cracks me up because sometimes, I'm one of those girls at Hooters who really isn't there for the view.  The food is never more than your standard sports bar \"ok\".  Some better moments than others.  You know how that goes.  But with us, we aren't going so much for the food - as for the sports.    Living in the downtown/South Mountain area, there aren't many sports bars as it is.  Then you narrow down which ones are showing the events you want, and we often end up here.  Especially for boxing!  One of the things I like about Hooters, and this one in particular, is that if you want to see - you have full view access.  But the TVs are high enough that if you could care less, you don't have to be staring at a television.  The problem is, it's Hooters.  If you aren't looking at the TV you have to be careful what it looks like you're looking at.  Is there such a thing as viewer's guilt?  Maybe there should be.    Sounds bad, but totally honestly - I just feel really bad for the girls who have to walk outside on a chilly night.  The comments that they have to deal with can be really awful.  There should be some kind of a \"Bad comment\" jar, like the old-school \"Bad word\" jars when you cussed.  The waitresses should be able to just walk over and hold out the \"Bad comment\" jar and make them pay up.  Guaranteed \"he got caught\" standing ovation from everyone in surrounding tables.  It's a thought..."}
{"text":"We come here whenever were in the mood for some Hooters chicken wings.    This place can get pretty busy when a game of some sort is on, so when it is real busy we don't bother.  We really like the breaded chicken wings with medium sauce with a side of the curly fries. I have tried the fried pickles too and they are really good as well as some other foods over the years but mostly always crave the wings.  We usually always get just the legs you always pay a little more for your order but we think it is well worth it.   Service is usually always friendly and fast.  I still have people tell me they have never been to a hooters thinking it is just a bar atmosphere. I do not find it inappropriate to bring a family if your over on the side where your away from the bar area. It feels like anyplace else to go in and eat at, never had any issues eating here.  Check this location out, it is not far off the 215 on Rainbow.  Definitely our favorite place for wings compared to other places that have real small ones these are always a good size."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Food was really bad quality. They took forever for bringing food. Never gonna come back to hooter"}
{"text":"Ok seriously, my friends & I came for lunch yesterday. A girl named Sarah was our server. (Airhead) we all ordered water, & 2 of my friends got beers. I asked her about the food when it came time to order, this girl didn't know a damn thing about either of the burgers i asked about. It was very apparent she didn't know much... Anyway, our appetizers came out before the drinks, & the beer had been sitting on the bar for 10 minutes. It came completely flat by the time we received them. My friend ordered crab legs & I ordered the buff chicken, a different girl dropped our food off at the table, my friend asked for crackers for his crab legs and the girl brought him back crackers, but not the kind you need for crab legs (lmao) individually wrapped saltine crackers!! The bottom of my bun was completely soggy, so gross! I just at the chicken piece and that was it! Nothing impressive, that's for sure. Then we were routinely bugged by Sarah, the last 30 minutes we were there. We had told her we were just hanging out for a little while... Ugh needless to say, we felt like we were dealing with a bunch of underage air heads with no waiting experience! Next time we wanna go to a restaurant to check out boobs n butt, we will drive to twin peaks :) Hooters is a mess! & I mean the staff! Lol"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and service!   Especially from Danielle she was awesome!  Will definitely be coming back for more games at this location. :)"}
{"text":"I called ahead and ordered a dozen wings and the girl on the other end said...do you mean 10? I said , no, i mean a dozen, which is 12. She said, 10 or 20? I was not getting why she didn't understand. So, back and forth again until she said...we have them in 10 or 20. Ohhh....well, you could've saved some time by saying that in the beginning. Anyways, i picked up my wings and they had no sauce and so i asked for sauce and she gave me a side of what looked like vomit. It looked as if the sauce broke or something. It was curdled almost. I dunno, but with another wing place right across the street, I'd tighten that situation up. Ew...just grosses me out to even think they would serve someone that.....crap."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Our waitress Brandi didn't know how to do her job. The management was arguing with our waitress right in front of our table. We left and then they overcharged half of our group by at least $10 per person.  DON'T GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Came by real quick, I don't go to Hooters to often. I like the environment lots of big screen TVs to watch the game and have a beer. Jamie was my waitress she was super polite and has a great personality. I had the oysters on the menu which were really good I would go with the sushi on because 1/2lbs just isn't enough. I also got some of thier boneless wings kind of reminded me of Buffalo Wild Wings but I think I like these ones better."}
{"text":"Great service from Melissa.  Cold tasty beer.  Flavor on the wings were good....but they COULD NOT have been smaller. This is the reason for 3 stars.  My service was excellent."}
{"text":"Good service and attentive girls. Came here bc I'm staying at the hotel and love the fried pickles. Pretty empty for the \"worlds largest\". Legit casino sports bar."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating lunch right now with friends and our baby, server is friendly, but it took 35 minutes to get an appetizer, she didn't take our order for 30 minutes, a drink menu went out with a special that they all said didn't go into effect till tomorrow. No prices for drinks listed on the menu, we will never eat here again. All workers seem clueless. Oh and also, very dirty. We sat down to a dirty table and food all over the floor. I advise to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just visited again about  1 month later from my last visit. The service was  even better than the last time !! The manager Phil was outstanding !!!! My server Selana was truly a treat to have taking care of me on this visit. Selana made sure that my order was complete and was just one of the most friendly  people I have had serve me.!! Thank you to all the Hooters staff  who are always competent, friendly ,and such a joy to see when I come through their doors. Thank you again ,From your customer Christine"}
{"text":"Great food. Service could be better. Terrible managment. Hostess let friends and other go ahead in line when packed. Managment does not strive for good customer service. Had a manager who really didnt seem to care that we had been waiting and got terrible customer service. She sided with employees and made us feel like we were doing something wrong. Terrible..."}
{"text":"My husband always told me that when he went to Vegas with the guys, they all went to Hooters, because they had some good wings. Finally this trip, we had time to go there, and I tried the wings. Parmesan, and lemon pepper. Yes, I agree they are very good! Great snack, for drinking, and eating late at night at 3:15AM. LOL   Also, it wasn't a long line of a wait, (because of the fact being so early in the morning.) Our waitress was very nice, and came around to check on us periodically. She definitely knew what she was doing.   I'm 50/50 about the fries. One good thing is that it was a whole bunch of fries in a basket. I just felt like  the fries was too skinny, then again, who cares, it was around 3AM, and I was hungry/tipsy. LOL!!   Ya, definitely the spot to go to for some fries and wings late at night or whenever, and to top it off, really late at night/early morning when drinking."}
{"text":"Once again total bs I went to the left side of the restaurant directly to the bar and I ask one of the hostess about table sitting even that he's a sign by the door to say welcome coming in must be 21 she told us where the main entrance and the line was like it was a stupid of something I guess that's how she be bent told since day one...lol OK we sat at the bar finally the bartender approaches not too much wait but you should be quicker the bar wasn't even half full we do have the Grupon again 2 10 orders of wings we going to start with 10 hot almost 20 minutes later 20 hot wings come out okay no big deal I'm hungry I gonna eat it event she make a big deal about see my Gruponn on my phone before even giving my beers okay I was super hungry super thirsty then a guy came up to check my Groupon funny thing she forgot to mention that I thought everything was taken care of  Never got a meal check. ...  I was with 90 seconds to go home then a gentleman come out Groupon Groupon Groupon......Wtf   Are you a manager or something.....?  , no manners whatsoever  NO wonder why so many negative feedback.  I may go back ... to see how more the can fuck up... Of course I love the chicken wings that's the only reason"}
{"text":"Once once again good service in this location even though its way slow amber our server so what kind of good she was good my wings was really hot in temperature nice and crispy the way order my appetizer came out pretty fast but we hungry but once again the people are the door should be facing the customers no leaning on the podium with her ass up I guess that's Hooters policy lol. Good team work by the way"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 at this Spring Valley location which is not far from my house! Woo Hoo!  Everything was good for this first visit at approximately 3am.  What we ordered:  fried pickles-yummy!  bacon cheeseburger w/onion rings, burger was big and moist -yummy!  club sandwich- yummy!  grilled chicken sandwich-yummy!  curly fries- will skip those next time, dry and flavorless.  The service was good as well.  I have to say I was a bit surprised, the food was better than I had imagined it would be. Hats off to the cook, just past 3am the food was cooked really well!"}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere. Wait staff is very friendly  especially to families. Order the unbreaded Daytona wings and the loaded tots. Yum!"}
{"text":"I really liked the boneless chicken wings.  Was disappointed in that a number of the beers advertised they didn't actually sell and found the waitress was too pushy to expedite my order and get another beer even before I was close to finishing the one I had.  That being said, it is a tacky novelty value, and with plenty of tv screens good for a beer, bite to eat and watch one of many games."}
{"text":"Service was not the best, the food was cold not even hot. The wings literally were plain with sauce just tossed on them. The server was being overly sexual with our child present. Not impressed. She was rude about the fact that we ordered our sons food from the kids menu after we had ordered our wings."}
{"text":"Hooters ist eine Bar welche vor allem durch die Bedienungen hervorsticht, was allerdings bekannt ist. Service war sehr gut, schnell und freundlich!   Das Essen war okay, preislich in Ordnung aber eben nichts besonderes, deswegen Punkt Abzug...   Um für einen Abend einen draufzumachen ist es gut!"}
{"text":"It's Hooters.  It's Tempe.  It's Wing Wednesday...all you can eat for $10.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Finally, a Hooters with actually good looking women to cater to my needs.  Great place to catch play off basketball.  The wings were plentiful and the beers kept flowing.  My waitress flaked on me because a group at another table kept drawing her attention while i waited anxiously for my food as it sat at the window for quite a bit.  Other than that, I got what I paid for. and I left full"}
{"text":"Our service isn't bad this evening but I'm writing a complaint about the service observed around us. Poor. So very poor. Waitresses aren't paying attention to tables, drinks are going empty, it's sad. And I'm a server so that bothers me. But the worst by far is seeing a server more concerned with pulling up a chair with buddies in the patio to smoke and haulk loogies over the fence. With customers out here! So gross and unprofessional. I'm thankful she wasn't my server."}
{"text":"Chantel was awesome with making sure that she was friendly and attentive.  When she brought my daughter her drink she had drawn a cute little owl. This is why I gave three four starts instead of just three.  Anyway we got 10 hot wings and 10 garlic parm.  The garlic parm for me where just ok but hubby liked them."}
{"text":"Can you really go wrong with hooters wings? I love the chipotle honey sauce. View well with breaded bone in and boneless."}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ and this was my first Saturday night coming to Hooters.  I came right after getting off of work to grab some wings and a beer before heading home for the evening.  I just wanted to say the staff was extremely friendly and fun.  I definitely enjoyed my visit and will be coming back.  Brandi, tending bar, was great to talk to; quick witted and funny.  Food was great, on time and delicious, even though when I walked in, there was a UFC fight going on and the place was packed.  Their ability to get food and drinks out with a full house was refreshing.  I was skeptical at first but they nailed it.  I would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"What do you do with your coworkers after work? Well apparently, I go to Hooters.  OK. I don't normally go to hooters, but it was pouring rain and this place was nearby and we wanted some chicken wings. I also tried their poutine and their deep fried pickles. I'd never seen pickles not fried as spears, and I enjoyed the hooters tactic. Slices really maximize the breading ratio, which I like. The poutine was horrible. The wings were great.   Listen, I'd be lying if I didn't say the overall eating-after-drinking...errr... I mean working thing wasn't done pretty well here, but I can't in good conscience give hooters a good rating. I feel icky for having gone, and I hope these beautiful ladies move onto other serving jobs where they are able to wear more clothing soon.   PEPPER TAKES PAUSE: Do you think they really make that much more in tips dressed like that? Discuss."}
{"text":"Friends and I went to Hooters after having dinner at Town Crier. It was pouring rain outside, and we wanted to head somewhere close - so we made the impulsive decision to check out Hooters.  I'd never been to one before, but it was pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Scantily clad and generally indifferent waitresses, no drink menu (you have to ask!), and gag-worthy kitsch posted all over the walls. The soccer game was playing in the background, but the hordes of creepy, middle-aged men were otherwise distracted.  A pitcher of Keith's Red, after tax and tip came to a mind-blowing $30. Three glasses of extremely watery, no-longer carbonated beer for thirty bucks. Quite honestly one of the most expensive beers I've had in my life, and also one of the worst.  Avoid this place like the waitresses avoid the creepers hitting on them."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if that was an option. It seems not many people are happy about the quality of food and others are upset about how long it took to get the food. I wish I was so lucky. The hostesses were busy talking and playing on their phones to acknowledge us the moment we walked up. We were seated and AFTER we put our menus down to indicate we were ready to order we waited an additional 10 mins for our waitress. We watched as waitresses went and chatted up tables, cleaned tables around us, and chit chatted with eachother before we gave up and went to the food court! I have literally given up on Hooters as a dining establishment!"}
{"text":"I'm a super hot wing fan, I love them hot, I love them big as well as flavorful.   Not a big fan of vinegar based sauces and these do fall into that category. That being said I do like eating here as the wings are top notch for a franchise trying to satisfy the masses.  I've eaten here a few times and today the wait staff finally hit all the things you would expect from a Hooters girl. Hot, Hot and Damn Hot.   Only disappointment was when I asked for a TV to be changed to the Cubs game I was told sure right away. 20mins later as I was paying our bill the TV was still on the motocross event that not a soul was watching. (We were one of three tables in our section and that TV wasn't visible to anyone outside of our table so it could have been changed to WGN to satisfy a Cubs fan).  Our food was delicious, the fried pickles seemed weak on their own but the sauce that came with them turned them into a OMG appetizer.  We will be back the next time I want/need something hot & spicy to eat."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister last night before a screening of a movie to get some drinks. It was pretty slammed because NBA finals were on but we found 2 seats at the bar no problem. I got my ole faithful COORS LIGHT!!! She got Patron Margarita! The bartenders were slammed but were great at checking up on us and making sure we were ok. On our refills another bartender made my sisters drink and when my sister tasted it right away she knew it was not patron. The Original bartender quickly fixed the problem and made her a fresh one. It was great customer service, except for the wrong drink being made... All she had to do is read the ticket... It was my sisters birthday and they were more then happy to help me embarrass her! They had her dance on a bar stood and flap her wings. It was fantastic. Overall good night. Definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Hooters Las Vegas.... In most other towns, this place is a novelty where girls with large tata's run around in signature white tank tops and short orange gym shorts with huge 80's style socks. In Vegas though, half of the casinos and everyone on the strip dresses like this. :_  Well.... minus the atmosphere, the food is basic, fried and soaked in various levels of hot sauce. Personally, I do not know of anyone (other then my friend or grandfather) who come here for the food. Maybe it's the atmosphere or their awesome service? Ok.... maybe not the service. Must be the warm and inviting atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"When your friends turn out to be males and want to eat some wings, we usually end up at Hooters.   While the wings and drinks were great, the service was not. I wouldn't mind if it was a busy night and there were 249283094328 people, but when I can see the waitresses sit directly at a table across from us and have a full conversation with her friend, then I wouldn't come back to that experience. Beware!"}
{"text":"Sorry Hooter. The Wings were pretty bad. I have not been to a Hooters in many years. The food has changed. Not good."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful waitress Astrid! But the host had a face like she had just smelled something nasty the whole time she was very unwelcoming and rude to other customers. But again our waitress was wonderful"}
{"text":"Nice location adjacent to the pool and with a patio!  Before meeting some friends for food & libations to celebrate their opening, I played some video poker at the bar. Winner! Great selection of poker games that aren't common at bars, including 5 cent games.  Good to know!  Great service at the bar, and it's a nice circular bar layout. This is billed as \"The World's Largest Hooter's\"  and the double meaning wasn't lost on me! You'll have to see for yourself if they live up to it. We ate on the upstairs patio and it was a nice, rainy night. We had the standard Hooter's fare of wings, boneless wings and dessert. The wings were tasty especially when I added hot sauce and I really loved the peanut butter pie!  Perhaps this outlet will last longer than the previous one or two or three."}
{"text":"Why would a Hooters survive in Vegas? If you want to ogle women, the servers at better casinos are just as good looking and wear skimpier outfits. When I visited, the servers wore heavy makeup and looked pretty hard core. I never did go for the short shorts and pantyhose look. These are industrial strength pantyhose, more like a leotard. It's hard to appreciate nice legs when they're sheathed in sausage casing.  I just had a hamburger. It was good. The beer selection wasn't much. There were some kids scampering about. I never thought of Hooters as a family venue.  I have a hunch why Hooters hangs on in Vegas: Mormons!  Vegas has a sizable Mormon population. As you may know, these guys are as straight as they come. They never have lust in their hearts (outside the home). But when the wife's out of town, they probably like to get a little naughty.  Walk on the wild side.  While some guys go for a wild night in a strip club, Mormons probably get their kicks at Hooters.  If I sound sarcastic toward Mormons, don't get me wrong. I've had Mormon co-workers and even a Mormon boss. I would jump at a chance to work with them again. Fine people as a rule."}
{"text":"I just wanted a beer and the service was HORRIBLE .  I waited at my table for a waitress but that didn't happen so I sat at the bar  and wasn't much better.  I got one beer and couldn't get the bartender to come back.  I don't think they realize that they work on tips for good service not because they have a skimpy costume.  BTW-for a college town, the girls weren't good looking at all.  Maybe because it was Monday night and the C team was working."}
{"text":"Seriously had a blast here! I came in on a Thursday by myself (I know creeper status, but I was staying at the Palms, so back off). Immediately, I was greeted by bartender Autumn and Miska. They were amazing! The service was great and the conversations were even better. The staff (Amanda, Autumn, Adrienne, Kylee and Miska) not only were very hot and nice... I know, I know, I'm in Hooters, that's what they do. But they really made me feel like I was one of their friends. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow so I order some wings with ranch, and celery and a side of fries. Also with a beer and water. I got my beer wings and ranch. I asked for my fries celery and water. Got my fries. I then ask for another beer. 15 minutes past I find feathers all over one of my wings. Informed watresssm nothing and she asked if needed anything else I said my beer would be nice. Got my beer that was sitting at bar for 15 minutes. Terrible service and no concern on customers happiness."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The wings suck and the service too! Luckily for us our waitress was the hottest one there. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Hooters offers some pretty good wing specials.  It's the only thing I've had in the menu.  Unfortunately the beer options are weak for such a famous chain,  but the wings are worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Went for the endless wings Wednesday.  Nothing too special, lots of sauce (Actually made us sick to our stomach).  Place looked pretty clean, waitress was VERY nice and on top of her stuff!"}
{"text":"Seated at a dirty table. Taco salad was inedible. Rotting cabbage floating in vinegar. Yuck. The small scoop of chilli  plopped into the center was quite good. Crappy WiFi. Server disappeared. Had to ask 3 ppl for our bill. (Including the manager) Smell inside was horrendous.  Thank goodness there was outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Omg omg dont eat here...the food is cold and gross.and the waitress keep saying it was due to changing of cooks but I was here for 2 hrs....beer was cold but its nothing new for the beer.... just on the other thought my pickle was warmer then my fries they served..."}
{"text":"I hate it when I have to compare US chains to their Canadian counterparts, but sometimes it has to be done (I'm looking at you Chili's). I've only been to Hooters a few times in the States, but even with my limited exposure, the Toronto location was just not up to snuff. The fried pickles were a little less crispy and the wings seemed a little more skimpy than what I've experienced back home. Does anywhere in a Toronto have pickle chips (NOT spears!) besides Hooters??? I've been here three years and have yet to find them.   One other minor beef - we called ahead to see if they were playing the UFC fight and were told that they were. Great! When we got there, yes, they were playing the fight, but without sound :/ so be forewarned, if you're going for a sporting event, you might be stuck listening to their in-house radio, which actually wasn't so bad - there was some U2, Fuel, White Stripes... Basically what you'd expect at a bro-bar.  Our waitress was very sweet and totally cool with us camping to watch the fight, so there was that!   I'll probably be back next time I have a fried pickle craving, unless I can find a better Chip option. Seriously, Toronto, help a sister out!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel and that was a huge mistake. The restaurant was the best part of our stay. Service was excellent. Thank you Emma"}
{"text":"This is the best Hooters location I've been to in AZ!  Server: Desiree Time & Date: Thursday Nov. 27th at around 6pm   Environment:  Very clean, and the outside patio has the comfiest seats too!   Service:  I've been to several Hooters before, and being a woman it can be a little awkward at times. I have either encountered the stuck up servers who can't remember or get an order right to save their life and I've also had the servers who try to invade my personal space while calling me \"sweetie\" or \"hun\" for a better tip.  Finally I have arrived at a place where they treat you like normal human beings!   My waitress was so kind, she opened conversation not by \"what do you want to drink\" and rushing away but by approaching me with a smile and a \"how was your day\". And I can tell you that after a long day at work that was really refreshing to see and that kind of customer service goes a long way.  She was also very attentive, checking several times to make sure our food was hot and to our liking and that our drinks were always filled.  The manager even stopped by to see how everything was.  Great service and I will definitely be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"For a hooters, there weren't too many hooters (if you know what I mean).  Went here twice while I was in town. Waitresses didn't tell us about any specials when we arrived, had to ask. Food was mediocre and so was the lemonade. Stick to the wings and beer and you'll be fine. Service was very slow on our second trip but they were busy. She made up for it later. Would I go back? Yeah. But just because it's Hooters."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Hooters, but I came here with my husband who swears that the food  here is awesome, LOL. It's been a while, but I have been to one other location when I lived in California. They are all the same to me: average food and slow service. But I get it, this is a place to watch sports, hang out with friends and have a good time. (Hey, it's different for those of us who don't drink alcohol :P)  Our server was polite and friendly. She got us our drinks quickly after we sat down and took our food order not too long after that. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Our food took like 35-40 minutes to come out. Really?? It wasn't a full house at all. There were 2 other tables that were occupied and a bunch of people sitting at the bar. During that time, our waitress disappeared as well. We had to flag her down just to get us our drink refills. Ugh, why is service always so damn slow at Hooters?? It also sucks when you are super hungry!  I have always enjoyed their Lots-A-Tots (without the chives). Tater tots with cheese, sour cream and bacon, how can you go wrong? Other than that, I have never really found anything I liked on the menu. From what I remember, the wings made me feel sick, and the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was bland and soggy (although that was years ago in California). I kept it simple and ordered the burger sliders. They were pretty tasty, but the meat patties were much smaller than the buns that they used. My husband on the other hand, likes just about anything on the menu.   Other than the awesome Lots-A-Tots, there were a few other positive things about this place. The restaurant was very clean, they leave wet naps for you on the table (hey, most places you have to ask), and the manager was walking around asking everyone how they were doing. Seriously, he stopped by our table 3 times to check up on us. He also processed our payment at the end since our waitress never came back.   Not a place I would visit again, but if I do, let's just hope I'm not starving again!"}
{"text":"JENNA I don't usually write bad reviews because it could just be an \"off night\" and I don't want to damage the reputation based on one event. With that said, I been to this Hooters 3 times in a month and the service was consistently horrible.   I sat at the bar twice, both times being served by Jenna. Sorry to name drop you but you were the worst. I don't think you can run drinks and take food orders at the same time. This appeared to be too much to handle.  Jenna started off rude, which at first we were thinking was a \"playful\" rude, but it continued for the whole time. After taking our food order, she would refuse to make eye contact with any of us for the entire 40 minutes that we waited for our food. She was filling drink orders and completely ignoring us. No drink refills for us. No status updates on our food.   I finally asked someone else to check on our food, and they brought out our appetizers and our main dish at the same time. They both tasted like crap. As though they were sitting out for 30 minutes. The appetizer (pretzel) was room temperature and dried up. The wings tasted like they were under a heat lamp for 20 minutes.     The experience would have been completely different if Jenna was more attentive to her costumers. Instead, our glasses were empty, our food was cold and the service was terrible.   We will not return to restaurant."}
{"text":"The chicken wings were not as great as what I expected, I've had way better wings at the local pub, and boneless wings are more like chicken nuggets, the buffalo sauce did not have any kick to it at all, it was mostly butter. If you are craving good wings, go somewhere else, but if your looking for eye candy, you've come to the right place. Overall experience, my tummy was fed, service ok, a bit pricy, am I coming back? Probably not."}
{"text":"The hostess Audriana shouldn't be allowed to be a hostess, stick her in the back for prep work so no one else has to encounter her attitude. As a previous restaurant manager, your hostesses are the face of the company. The first people your customers encounter. My boyfriend dropped me off at the door to get a table, so I put my name in and proceeded to wait. Well I wanted to double check to make sure there wasn't anything inside at the bar, when I was about to walk back outside my boyfriend walked in with a nose bleed and needed to go to the bathroom. She had the audacity to stop us and tell us we can't be inside \"you must wait outside,\" extremely rude as he had blood dripping down his face. We haven't even eaten yet. Hope our server is better."}
{"text":"I don't have super high expectations when I walk into a Hooters but this location has definitely killed whatever hope I had of getting a decent bar experience. I give two starts instead of one because there are some great waitresses there. I'm not sure if it's the cooks or the manager, but something is horribly wrong. Myself and 4 friends went here after a hornets game(probably getting in at 9:30pm). Expecting the place to be packed, only the right side of the restaurant seemed to be occupied with the left being empty. We ordered our food: two all you can eat wings with fries, buffalo shrimp, six piece wings and a turkey burger. After waiting 30 min for our food, our waitress tells us they are out of turkey patties. My friend and his girlfriend decided they had enough and left. It took another 5 min for our food to come out and the two all you can eat wings were slightly cold and did not have fries. It took another 5 min for one set of fries to come out and the second set never came. We ended up complaining to the manager who blamed \"everyone from the Hornets game coming here\" but we put our food order in waaaay before it got busy. It was Monday night football and a Laker/Hornets game. It should've been staffed better."}
{"text":"The quality of the food/drinks is average; nothing to complain about. But the service is horrible, not only did it take too long to take my order, our waiter was hardly available. Wait time for food/drinks way too long. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"First and last time here.  It took over 30 minutes to get service. We were a party of four and got seated NO ONE came over to greet us for at least 10 minutes. So three of us got up went to the bar and got our own drinks. When we came back the waitress still hadn't come by, so we moved to a more populated seating area. I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and sent it back twice because of little to none alcohol in it. I understand the point of the drink is to not taste alcohol, however why did I taste only pineapple juice? The second time I had a rude guy come out and say \"you know you're not suppose to taste the alcohol right? I filled it almost all the way up no extra charge\" uhm okay?  Then the food came, it sucked. My medium boneless were definitely the mild butter ones. Gross.  $70 later and I was still hungry...  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We ( husband / I ) have come to Hooters twice in the last month. The first time was nice. So we thought to book here with the boys ( 21 yrs old / 13 yrs old) and  so disappointed. Swimming pool has been closed the entire time our stay. The only entertainment at the hotel for the boys is the swimming pool. * Not trying to let the 21 yrs old get loose in Vegas* just not the place. Trust me!!!!!! Oh forgot to mention. The reason for the pool being closed is *NO LIFEGAURD"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home, and worst Hooters I have been to yet! After ordering 20 wings and a fry, it took over 25 min to get our food! Which also came out separate and not even hot. Then to get the check and get it processed another 10 min! We were about to go to the host to get a check to pay. When you are this close to the interstate you would think they would have somewhat descent speed. Not once saw a Manger to say something to."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere. Brittany is an amazing waitress we had her last night she's the sweetest!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, coming here for oysters and shrimp.  We were waited on by Marketta, and a red headed bartender.  I have not had worse service anywhere in Las Vegas.  Our server never gave us a refill, tho we were eating spicy wings, had apps etc. When I went to the bar to get our refills, the bartender was rude too.  Save your time and money, apparently this location only wants male customers."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats. Ordered fish and chips and it was horrible. Fish and Chips were the worst I've ever had. Burger tasted like water. Fries were frozen and tasted like nothing. Plus... They didn't give cutlery. Had to eat the terrible coleslaw with my fingers. Never will I order from them again."}
{"text":"The food looked delightfully tacky, but in taste was unrefined.  It was sub par, and did not meet my expectations.  The aroma was unsatisfying, and the flavor left much to be desired.  The photos on the menu were low quality.  The grilled cheese was greasy and flavorless.  The nachos were not vegetarian friendly, the menu did not specify that they did have meat.  The fish and chips was basically an entire fish atop a bed of fries.  Although the waitresses were very nice, I was not offered a refill of my coke, which tasted suspiciously like pepsi.  At one point my personal space was invaded by an excessively social bee. The highlight of my visit to Hooters was the gift shop.  If I was straight I would rate it five stars."}
{"text":"Wings were amazing.. as always Girls beautiful.. as always Atmosphere was great.. as always  Thanks"}
{"text":"Wow these wings must be the freshest wings ever for them to take over an hour to make .  The order was put in an hour ago and I get here and one person has actually talked to me. She even said she was going to get it and it's been another 15 minutes of me sitting here. No one else has asked why I'm here not doing anything except waiting . Horrible service at the bar and all the people walking around just look at you with this clearly fake smile. This isn't even my order. They have lost a customer they never even had."}
