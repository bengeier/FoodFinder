{"text":"Great new deli in downtown Cleveland!   The menu has plenty of options for everyone and everything I have tried has been great. Especially the French fries.   Also they offer weekly dinner specials starting at 4 pm. They have offered a different salmon every week and they all have been amazing.   Want a good deli meal, or a good entree then stop at Als!"}
{"text":"Rude cashier, depressing fluorescent lighting, uninspired decor, soggy and reheated fries (sigh).  Sad, it has such potential!  At least the falafel wrap was good!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! The grilled ham and cheese was great and the fries were great! It was the middle of the afternoon, so it was fairly quiet here. A little pricey, but not unexpected in a downtown eatery. Easily recommendable."}
{"text":"This place looks great and the employees are nice the food is a little expensive just as a heads up if you substitute your side for anything it will cost a dollar fifty more."}
{"text":"They have a very friendly staff, fast service and a good selection/quality of food. I only knocked them one star because they are on the pricer side for the amount of food you get. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I work in the general downtown area and I have been here for lunch a handful of times and everything has been great!  I have a hard time deciding between there amazing deli sandwiches (Pastrami and Corned Beef are both LEGIT) and their middle eastern options. (Shawarma and Shish tawook) Sometimes I get both! The daily specials always look great too. I have not tried breakfast but I hear it is also good."}
{"text":"A pretty good place to go for lunch. The prices are pretty standard for downtown and the food is delicious. It gets a bit hectic around lunchtime but that's to be expected of a good place. I highly recommend the Asian style noodle entr√©e dish."}
{"text":"Yum! I was taking a class above this deli and it definitely rose above all the other restaurants in the area. All of the fried, greasy, overpriced food in the Galleria next door doesn't even come close to my craving for this place.   My class was three weeks long and I had breakfast here about four or five times, and it didn't break the bank. They have a breakfast special for $4.95 and includes eggs, hash browns, meat, and toast. I opted for the breakfast crossaint and it was huge and delicious with a cup of coffee and my loyalty card ($.50 off every day) it came to about 5 bucks.   Lunch is well priced too. I had a turkey sandwich which was freshly sliced from their deli with chips and a pickle for about 6 dollars. The portions are filling and like I said, it is a much healthier and less expensive option than the food court across the street.   The ladies at the counter are always smiling and put you in a great mood! I needed it when waking up super early to sit through an 8 hour snooze class. This place is awesome! If I'm ever in the area again I know where I'm eating!"}
{"text":"We try to go once a week just to have their Ruben sandwich. There is no fat on the meat and the taste worth coming back for! Al's is family owned and you can tell they care about cleanliness and service. Every employee up front greets you like family and they actually smile! So far this is our #1 place to eat in downtown Cleveland! Thanks Al's!"}
{"text":"We just got back from spending two days in downtown Cleveland--the area is mostly hotels with a lot of bars and high-end restaurants, but except for an Au Bon Pain, not many options for breakfast.  We asked a local if there was anyplace that has a good and reasonable breakfast, and she pointed to Al's, just across the way, and we got a good feel about the place, which turned out to be spot on. I had omelets both days--a huge Western omelet the first day, a special Southwestern omelet the second day.  Both were huge and excellent--they were as good as what I would expect in the best diners in New Jersey, or coffee shops in New York City.  The fries were well seasoned, with a nice crunch, but very tender on the inside.  Also, excellent coffee.  Super friendly.  I'll go  back to Al's in a heartbeat if we ever stay in downtown Cleveland again."}
{"text":"YASSSSSS AL'S YASSSSSS!!!  This place is a gem and isn't a hit or miss kind of spot. Everything i've had has been really good. There's a lot of choices on the menu to make anyone happy and the food is consistently excellent. I love the breakfast croissant sandwiches, I always get mine with turkey bacon or sausage and with scrambled eggs and cheese."}
{"text":"I got the breakfast quesadilla and I am looking forward to It. I am so hungry. I am ready to eat. I hope It is as good as I want It to be."}
{"text":"This is in route to the Rock Hall of Fame  The staff is very friendly, that's the most important thing right.  The food (breakfast) is great, that's the second most important thing right.  We came here to grab some grub before seeing the Hall of Fame. The outside looks like a quaint little mom and pops. It's right next to Dublin Donuts, but the outside charm led us here.   When we walked in l, we were pretty impressed. It's a really decent sized place. Don't let the outside fool you. The atmosphere is very welcoming, it makes you want to stay and dine in. The huge windows bring plenty of outside light- the upbeat music makes even the most grumpy morning person want to dance.   The service is quick, there's plenty of specials, I recommend the TWO/TWO/TWO for the breakfast lovers out there."}
{"text":"Finally a good local breakfast spot downtown that's open on Saturday. And the food is good enough to make Saturday mornings in the office enjoyable."}
{"text":"I just started a new job downtown and was recommended to try Al's for lunch. It was also very cold out today, and Al's was the closest option, so it seemed like the best choices overall.  The decor and design is simple and clean. The tables appear to be real wood instead of plastic or aluminum, and the chairs were very comfortable, and it all added a slight rustic touch to what was otherwise a very contemporary layout, which worked very well. We arrived around 11:30, just shortly before the lunch rush.  The deli case had several large hunks of fresh meats and cheeses, and the menu had quite a few non-deli options. My two (also new) coworkers got pastrami sandwiches, and I got a chicken shawarma. We were, as a whole, fairly underwhelmed. It was decent, but not ~$10 each decent. It was quick, but not really quick.  Overall, if it weren't for the proximity I don't know that I would be back. It's not bad, but a little expensive for the quantity/quality of food."}
{"text":"Very fair prices, daily specials, and a range of standard deli fare to a few Mediterranean options.  Pretty quick lunch service.  Grilled chicken sandwich and Californianclub samdwiches were very good.  Order and wait for your number to be called.  Way less expensive than Slyman's and more choices than Danny ' s Deli.  Lots of windows so you don't feel as if you are locked in someone's basement while eating like you do at the above-mentioned places."}
{"text":"I went today during my lunch break for the St. Paddy's day special. Ghada was super friendly. The location was really clean and inviting. My corned beef was AMAZING. Even though the place was absolutely packed, my order was ready within 5-10 minutes. The coffee I got was also delicious. The price is so reasonable for the quality of the food. All around amazing deli place and I'll be adding it to my rotation of lunch places!"}
{"text":"Als continues to have the best food downtown! No one can offer up faster higher quality food during your lunch break. They have an amazing staff and the food to match. Fan of Gyros?  Als Gyros are world Class!!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh tasting and the staff was really friendly. I wish there were pictures of some of the the dishes because I would have tried something different if it looked good. I'll definitely be back next time I stay at the Hampton Inn across the street."}
{"text":"So good!  GREAT value. My mom and I split the falafel and the pastrami and corn beef Andre's Masterpiece!  It's kind a bare-bones inside and my first impression was a little bit unsure of how the food would be. But we were both pleasantly surprised! Food was fantastic!  And the service was very very friendly.   Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I wish I had been introduced to Al's a long time ago.  Usually when I travel to CL for work I'm taken to a food court or a mile hike to find something to eat.   So Al's was a nice surprise.  My roast beef sandwhich was terrific and the french fries were delicious! Good, quick place to eat in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in downtown Cleveland. Walking into Al's Deli reminds me of walking into the Cheers bar ... it feels like everyone knows your name in this wonderful little family run business. Try the fattoush, the lebanese salad (with chicken added) is better here than anywhere else I have ever had it. Also great burgers, chicken sandwiches, steak fries ... pretty much everything here is delicious."}
{"text":"Best corn beef sandwich in town!!! People are friendly and Al is always working in the kitchen. This gem is about to become a Cleveland Tradition right across the street from St Johns's Cathedral and in the heart of it all. Al has been All In before All In was All In !!!!"}
{"text":"A bunch of great options. Went with the Philly Chicken and fries and it was solid. Staff there was SUPER friendly and pleasant. There breakfast options look awesome, I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Reasons I love Al's Deli:   1) They are conveniently located in the 1717 building  2) The people working here are the kindest, most pleasant people, ever!  3) It is very clean and you can see that 4) Their breakfast is to die for  I was waiting for Al's Deli to make its debut since August, so when they finally opened, I had to try! I was greeted by smiling faces and felt so welcomed. I ordered breakfast that morning, and the rest is history. I have Al's breakfast about once or twice a week, I just love their home fries and everything is made fresh to order, so your food is actually hot, even 10 minutes later.  I have tried other dishes, but my favorite thing to order from here is the breakfast menu and if I had to give a recommendation for lunch, it would be the Philly chicken sub, ah so delicious! Wonderful people work here and the owners are around often, and remember me when I come in, which is really nice.   I wish they were open a little later. They are only open until 7pm weekdays, 2pm Saturday, and closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"Best pastrami (Vienna Beef) this side of the Hudson River. Prices are low and portions are generous. Liked lunch so much I went back for breakfast the next day. Hard to find since the door is in an alley but right around the corner from the Doubletree. And Al really works there."}
{"text":"I love this place. Vibe is so good. The staff is friendly and efficient. The food is delicious and it's just a great environment. Huge bay windows so you can still look outside and enjoy your food. Reasonably priced too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Al's deli. I am from out of town and working near the deli so I decided to try it out. I liked it so much I went back four times! I got the Rueben, chicken shawarma, turkey club and turkey wrap. All of them were good but my least favorite was the shawarma. The staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in Cleveland. Fast service. Nice downtown location."}
{"text":"My first visit since the move to the corner of 9th & Superior.  I had visited the old location a few times in the past and never had a bad meal.   I visited here for lunch during the Holiday break, so there was a steady stream of customers, but not overly crowded.  I ordered the tabouli salad which was priced at $6.99, I had printed a coupon from the website which granted $1.00 off.  I ordered my salad, to go.  I arrived back at work with a decent portion (not sure it was worth the $6.99 menu price, but not a bad deal with $1.00 off.   The tabouli was definitely freshly made because the bulgur was still a bit hard, and the flavors hadn't quite meshed together yet.  Lots of tomatoes and too many onions for my taste.  Also tasted like bottled lemon juice had been used instead of fresh squeezed lemons. The salad was accompanied by large piece of pita that had been cut into 4 triangles.  All in all my salad was decent.  I will return, but will probably choose a different menu item."}
{"text":"This is a tough one guys...  Breakdown.  I was #34 and folks #62 were getting served.  They got a \"1\" for food service.  I ordered a Shish Tawook Rolled chicken, tabouleh NO fries. GOT well seasoned fries, but I didn't want them and they put my Tabouleh IN my Shish Tawook. ..wrong!  The \"sandwich\" was flavorful, but rather dry...not nearly enough garlic sauce. They got a \"3\" for that dish.  The Stuffed Grape leaves sat for the 15 min I had to wait and I had to ask for hot ones... hmmm, yeah, so you guys get another \"1\" on that one. The taste earned a \"5\" , however!!!!! Served with Pita and yogurt sauce, yes a \"5\"  It's clean and staff is pleasant.. hence , my score of 3. I'LL  give them another try... I truly believe they could earn a 5 once I provide feedback to the Manager. Stay tuned,  because you know I keep it real!  BTW,  by time I left, they were on #96 in 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't it be great if we could give half star ratings? This place definitely would benefit from a half star to get it up to a 3.5 star rating.  Like most places the vegetarian options were slim pickings. I settled for a quesadilla sans chicken and was told I could substitute the chicken for extra veggies such as spinach and/or mushrooms. We went as a large group for lunch and because the deli was so crowded, we weren't able to sit together. However the wait time for food was pretty reasonable. I thoroughly enjoyed my veggie quesadilla which had great cheese pull. From what I gathered from the group, the pastrami sandwich as well as the steak and cheese were nothing special."}
{"text":"A great deli with awesome employees!  I was in Cleveland for business for the first time, and I was looking for a quick place to grab dinner within quick walking distance of my hotel. I found this place right across the street. It was a quick and chilly walk over. The Assistant Manager greeted me upon entering and gave me recommendations. I chose the corned beef reuben. The sandwich was amazing along with my dark roast coffee. The chef even came out to inquire if I was pleased with my food. Overall, I love this place, and I will be returning if I'm ever back in the city."}
{"text":"I'd say the breakfast Omelet is about a 3 star but the home fries were delicious. The service was friendly and quick so I bumped the overall to a 4.   I needed quick breakfast and was in the area and didn't feel like paying the $20 that was being charged at the hotel. I stopped by Al's and ordered an Omelet combo. The Omelet was ok, did the job but not as good as places like ihop, maybe it's just me that prefers the inside out type of omelet. I also tried to cut a few calories so I didn't get cheese, maybe which would have helped the omelet a little. I just thought it was a little bland and the water from the vegetables leaked into the egg. I did love the home fries; it wasn't too salty but had great seasoning and a crispy outside with a warm soft inside. It came with toast and condiments like butter, jelly, and ketchup.   A pretty good place for breakfast if you are in the area, but I think I might stick to a b'fast sandwich next time."}
{"text":"IMHO, Al's offers the freshest and most delicious lunch downtown. I've ordered many different items here (breakfast and lunch) and I've never been disappointed. I especially love their Cranberry Salad with roasted pecans, apples, and blue cheese crumbs.  The restaurant is super clean and full of natural light. I love sitting at the barstools that line the window to soak in some excellent people watching. The staff is consistently friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the greatest spots for lunch in downtown Cleveland. The portions and prices are perfect for a mid day meal.  Try their corned beef sandwich and top it off with one of their massive cupcakes, you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while visiting downtown Cleveland for USBC  Junior Gold  youth bowling tournament.  Clean and nice view.  Food was real good.  Joe's special real good.  Had a bowl of clam chowder- large portion and was delicious.  Had a slice of lemon meringue pie - also large portion and very tasty.   Awesome experience"}
{"text":"I literally always eat at al's deli when i stay in cleveland.  It is hands down the best place within walking distance of the hilton double tree.m being vegetarian it's often hard to find nourishing food when I'm stuck in a hotel.  Especially nourishing food that is as good and as affordable as Al's.  They offer fine tasting and well prepared Mediterranean food as well as American favorites like omelets and hash browns.    They do close early, mid afternoon, but that doesn't bother me because I only ever am awake for early breakfast anyway.  The only reason Al does get five stars is their food is served on a tray with plastic silverware.  What ya gonna do though?  It is Cleveland."}
{"text":"Damn I want a burger.  Just a burger. Damn I want a burger...   That was me this afternoon.  So many places in downtown Cleveland are pooty-toot or to say it with a better vocabulary, upscale.  Because I was pressed for time, I was a faster but better than McDonald's burger and fries.  As I was running in the rain, I saw Al's small but distinguishable neon sign. I entered and overheard a few regulars describing a situation with a lot of F-bombs (Ha!). The woman behind the counter was really sweet; I damn near demanded a burger because it was nowhere on the menu and it's a absurb that a deli not have...  She smiled and pointed to the 3rd menu page.  \"There it is...The 2nd item.  Don't worry, everyone who wants a burger does the same thing.\"  I ordered a burger medium and fries. By the time I looked on Facebook to delete friend requests of people I don't know, my food was ready.  I bit into the burger and....do you all remember the \"hot and juicy\" ads from Wendy's?  If not, YouTube it.  That's how Al's burgers are.  I mean, the juice ran down my arm after each bite.  The fries were a bit on the greasy side, but were pretty good.  Wanna hear something funny?  The cook actually looked at my plate to see if I ate all of my food.  They also let me stay as long as I wanted until the rain stopped. Thanks, Al's!"}
{"text":"Better than anything in the galleria.  Al's offers several excellent, consistent dishes with grilled chicken.  Coordinate your visit with chicken bacon flatbread day.  Or pair a chicken quesadilla with the tortilla soup for an amazing lunch.  I've gone at least once a week for over two years, sometimes with orders for over 10 people, and they haven't messed up ONCE. The staff and kitchen are on point."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.    Great breakfasts!! Fast, affordable and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered the chicken wrap. I went in about 30 minutes before closing, and was the last one allowed to order to \"eat in\". Apparently they want to close up shop right at 3. The chicken wrap I had was pretty good, with chicken off the grill served with all the fix-ins and ranch. It was served with a side of chips, which consisted of the small bag you can buy in bulk at the grocery. I was a little disappointed in the amount of food you got for the price, but I understand it is a breakfast/lunch place, so no need to produce significantly large portions."}
{"text":"I freakin love Al's Deli! I often order from them for company lunches/breakfasts and events because their food is always fresh, pleasing to the eye, delicious and budget friendly.  Plus, they deliver (they are just down the street from me)!!  Not only is their food and delivery top notch, but the employees, especially Ghada are so helpful and friendly.  I never feel like I am a burden and I feel like they actually care about their customers.  For that, Al's Deli will always have my business."}
{"text":"Amazing! I have been going to Al's for years. I have tried most items off the lunch and breakfast menus. This place never disappoints! Friendly service with accurate orders. Reasonably priced for good downtown food.  The new fries are incredible!"}
{"text":"great spot in downtown Cleveland. We were told to come here by the hotel staff at the Wyndham as well as some friends.  They were super nice inside and the place got really busy towards lunchtime.    They have a lot of options, I will say the burger looked delicious.  We got the falafel rollup and the chicken shwarma rollup.  Both were good, good size for the price too, we are used to more expensive lunches at home so this was great."}
{"text":"I'm a lunch regular at Al's, primarily for their Middle Eastern specialties. I've had a couple of other things off of the standard menu, like a tasty pasta du jour, but their Lebanese fare really shines. Check out the smooth and flavor-packed hummus or the bright tabbouli. Great options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Clean and fast service. Spacious and good food options. I tried  Philly chicken. It was tasty. Overall decent place."}
{"text":"This building sat empty for soooo long and am so glad it's finally occupied! Bonus that it's has amazing Mediterranean options.   My office is right down the block and this is turning out to be my go to when I don't care about eating healthy for the day:) The falafel wrap is my fav downtown, and their French fries are the bomb.   Even when the line is long they get the food out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Great service and sandwiches! Reasonably priced. Only suggestions would be extending hours, serving halal meat, and improving the coffee quality and variety."}
{"text":"Went to Al's for breakfast, it was right across the street from the Hampton inn I was staying at so it was convenient.  The food was good and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last week and the food was great.  I ordered a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup, a fountain drink, and the Chicken Shawarma Rolled.  The chicken shawarma was really fresh and delicious.  I loved it and I would order it again and again.  The soup was also hot and delicious.  Great food and good service.  Loved it and I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved Al's Deli! We came here during the weekend of the Cleveland marathon and, being as with many Midwestern cities, the downtown was totally DEAD on that Saturday, we found comfort at Al's Deli which was open and ready to serve its customers.  Al was very friendly and accommodating. I had ordered the Mediterranean dish with hummus, tabbouleh, falafel and pita. He informed me they were out of that dish so I just decided to skip lunch since I wasn't that hungry anyway. But, he must have seen the disappointment in my face and he later let me know that they had found enough parsley to make the tabbouleh and they could in fact serve me this dish!  And it was excellent. They also had a good selection of sandwiches and breakfast items to choose from. They are conveniently located downtown and the service was fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend Al's."}
{"text":"So many places downtown to have lunch. One day I'll have tried them all, but for today I tried Al's.   I went in thinking Al's Deli was just that, a deli, but having seen the menu board there is so much more. Many of my favorite Middle Eastern options were listed such as Fattoush,  Shawarma, and Shish Tawook. I'll definitely be back to try one of those.   But since I was in deli mindset I had to get a sandwich. The Pastrami Sandwich was an excellent choice. It was surprisingly spicy, but just the right amount and came with a choice of cheese; Pepper Jack went well. The Pastrami, apparently house smoked, was served on rye with a pickle and a bag of original potato chips.   Through June there are coupons posted online."}
