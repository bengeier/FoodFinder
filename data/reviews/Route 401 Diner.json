{"text":"Found this diner  on yelp and decided to check it out. I love the atmosphere... just the kind of  no frills hole in the wall I was looking for. Simple menu, warm friendly and timely  service at great prices and decent coffee. I was satisfied with the food as I was not expecting to be wowed by the cuisine or the presentation.  Like I said...it's no frills.  If you are a food snob you will not appreciate this  place. Me?  I'll be back for sure if for nothing else,  the wonderful owner and the easy simplicity of the menu and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast; the place had a kind-of 50's theme with a few pictures on the wall.  Ordered the pancakes; they came quickly and they were quite good.  I would go again if I'm in the area. It's got a very homey feel and the food is good."}
{"text":"A true old fashioned diner that serves up great food at a great price. 
Sometimes small is better."}
{"text":"Absolutely great experience!! Very unobtrusive, little place. Went there with my boyfriend for lunch on Saturday.Everything from the original retro interior, great home made food( had a burger and 401 breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausages and huge pancakes) to customer service was awesome.
 What really stroke me was a home-like atmosphere among the guests who were dining there.I had a feeling everyone knew each other and had a great time.
One of those guest was the legend of Canadian box, George Chuvalo.
It was kinda neat!! George was just a part of a \"401 Family\", he enjoyed a simple yet delicious food in a crowd of every-day people.
Definitely going back there again!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall diner.  There's not a lot of parking but it didn't seem to be too busy during a weekday stop-in.  Bathrooms are downstairs FYI.  Food is regular diner fare and prices are reasonable.  Staff was very friendly.  If you are in the area for breakfast or lunch definitely check it out.  Forgot to mention the d√©cor, which is very retro!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch ... hopefully dinner soon!-)

They will be open on Sundays in June (2018)1, I guess I won't need fast on that day ...

Food is excellent and a very friendly place. Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out today. I went with my other half and he liked it. Good coffee and food. We both ordered the Italian breakfast.  My eggs weren't cooked - actually almost raw to the point I couldn't even eat them, though I ordered them as over medium. I didn't feel comfortable enough to complain or ask the owner to correct it, so I just avoided the eggs on my plate and ate everything else. 

The service was mediocre at best. Today is Easter Monday and the owner/server kept saying to customers that they were lucky that she even opened on Easter Monday because usually she doesn't; not a very welcoming statement. Anyways, I likely won't be back but it wasn't the worst place I've ever been."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a meeting and somehow ended up down this road. I spotted Route 401 Diner, and I was instantly curious. It sounds like an American, trucker diner... and I had a suit on. I contemplated on going in, but since it was 11:30 and I hadn't eaten yet.... It was a simple choice. 

Disclaimer, I love diners. So I am always excited to spot them!
Walking in... it wasn't really a trucker style diner...more like a neighbourly joint. Elements of a New York theme? Very cozy. Couple of retired guys hanging out having coffee. They had a sign for the specials (smoked salmon & spinach omelette) and overall, very classic! 

Thursday 11:30 - it was empty. I picked a booth by the window and got some coffee. I ordered a traditional breakfast (I asked for 2 eggs instead of three) with turkey sausages. The coffee was very good! And the meal hit the spot. The potion of home fries was much smaller than what you would expect, but I didn't mind it at all. I finished it all, and didn't feel like going to sleep right after. Thank you for not overflowing my plate with fries. 

The bill came out to about $8 with taxes. Not a bad deal at all! Considering a breakfast sandwich combo at Tims is close to $7. 
If you stumble down/up here... drop in for a bite. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A quiet, hidden-away local diner with adequate food and old-time atmosphere.

When visiting Toronto recently, I wanted to ensure that our busiest day started out right with a good breakfast, so that meant searching the local area for good eats: Yelp recommended this place.

Parking wasn't so great, but we managed to squeeze into the small lot with some twisting and a jump over a big, deep pothole filled with water. The place isn't much to look at from the outside, but that's not why I try out new diners: it's what's inside that counts.

Inside is a throwback to the 50's, which is in surprisingly good shape and kept quite clean if a little worn from time. We sat in a corner booth and enjoyed the fact that the morning sun didn't fry us through the windows, giving us a chance to take in the diner in all its retro glory.

The food was all right. If I had to describe it in a single word, it'd be 'servicable' - neither good nor bad. The portion size was decent, enough so that the waitress gave me a 'You can't finish that?' look with her best mom-face on, which I appreciated. It's unfortunate that the bacon, sausages, pancake and eggs weren't inspired in any way - I've eaten at hundreds of different breakfast places over the years and in my experience, these were moved out of the kitchen without any TLC apart from making sure they were cooked to modern standards.

Overall, I'd probably go back again, as there wasn't much else in the area, but I'm sure that if a new, modern place opens up locally that has a halfway-inspired kitchen staff, then the 401 is going to be in a run for its money. That upsets me, as I'd hoped for better for my first( and likely last )visit, because from the look of the place, the food should practically stand up and shout that there's a history of diner food here waiting to be discovered."}
{"text":"We always had a problem finding breakfast when we lived here. That was before google though. This time google results on Nov system brought up this place. Hidden away in an industrial park beside the 401 just off Kipling.

Very much a 1950s Diner complete with counter and chrome stools. The window ledge gad zero dust. And the ceramic pots and figurines sitting in the ledge also had zero dust.

3 eggs ham toast and home fries was less that 6 bucks. The eggs are cookedmore or less the way you want them. Served by a friendly and efficient wait staff. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover... The look of this place on the outside doesn't do it justice. I stopped by for lunch to go while at work and got the 401 clu which comes with fries and a small coleslaw. Food was entirely fresh, wasn't a huge fan of the rye they used but overall good lunch!"}
{"text":"Close to work. Checked em out, liked it. Went back several times with different friends all with positive experiences."}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast after seeing it from the highway. Was expecting a trucker type place, in a good way. It's actually a Euro style joint. Very clean, a little overpriced, server (manager ?) had a $60 haircut. Food is not greasy.
To be honest, the name is deceiving. I wanted to hear blue collar dudes talking sports and chicks, big slabs of back bacon and Toronto Sun to read. Probably will return but I wanted more character from a place called 401 Diner."}
{"text":"A very neighbourhood feel with some good basic breakfast fare and decently priced. It has a very nostalgic diner feel (more authentic vs corporate) and seemed a popular spot with folks from the area and family's finishing at the rink. It let us escape the rather busy and somewhat overpriced hotel option and got us off to a good start for the day. Not fancy but good solid comfort and homestyle breakfast on offer here and decent diner coffee as well."}
{"text":"Awesome diner! Great food, fast friendly service, and great prices. Anytime I have been there there have been, minimum, 10 pick ups from phone in orders, which shows that the place is doing something right!"}
