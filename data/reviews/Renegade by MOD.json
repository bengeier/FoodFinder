{"text":"Having had memorable meals at Kai, we were thrilled to learn of its former chef joining partnership here at Mod.   Signature touches and flair were apparent in the presentation, the food was innovative and some of it was excellent, such as the \"shroom\" dish.  The venison lollipops were too rare for me, but my husband said they were tasty.  He also had the pescado loco tar tare, and found it to his liking. I ordered the duck large plate and was disappointed-duck was good, but dish featuring beans, rice, okra, etc. was no better than say one would get at Milagro Grill or The Mission. The okra was unusually salty.  A server came to our table with a covered dish and asked if it were ours.  We inquired as to to what it was. He didn't know. He had come from the kitchen; not a regular waiter, but totally clueless. I do understand it was Labor Day Weekend and staff may have been not the usual crew. Our waitress was very pleasant, the hostess welcoming, and the others we encountered were attentive. Loud music for a younger crowd was intrusive. I could see going again for appetizers and a cocktail, but would not go back for dinner, considering the myriad of choices available here in the Valley."}
{"text":"My wife, my parents and I came here for my wife's birthday and had a pretty good time. The drinks were good, they had one my favorite bourbons which was nice (although I'd like to see more) and my wife loved the Rosemary Margarita.  The appetizers were excellent as well. The Venison was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was phenomenal.   For entrees my wife ordered the Duck breast which was tender and juicy, with flavors that paired very well together. My mother order the Filet which was cooked a very good medium rare. My father ordered the Diver Scallops which were cooked perfectly and the flavor was immense.   I ordered the Bone-In New York strip and requested it in between rare and medium rare, what I received was more raw in the middle and blackened on the outside. The center was  bright pink, almost like what you would see with seared tuna,and was cold. I'm used to seeing a dark red center on New York so this was surprising and a little concerning. I have never seen a steak with inside color like that before in all my years of steak eating. Perhaps I just needed to order it medium rare?  That aside, the glazing on the outside of the steak and the side items on the plate were very good. I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and the live music was very good. I would definitely comeback for the appetizers and drinks but I will try some other items on the menu before ordering the steak again. The burger looked awesome, and the ramen sounds interesting."}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis: a menu with interesting, delicious food worthy of a trendy restaurant, but bright lighting, decor, and a beer menu like a southwestern sports bar. Throw in a loud blues band on Sat night and we had no idea what to think!  Bottom line: it was empty at 8pm on a Sat night. But the food was great! Will be interesting to see if they can unravel who they want to be..."}
{"text":"Had a $25 gift card that I went to redeem for lunch today AND...they are closed.  Cleaning team was there, and they said they are closed forever."}
{"text":"What a disaster. Let me first start by saying, our favorite restaurant had been Kai, when MOD was the Exec. Chef. We went several times to Renegade based on our past experience.  Each time, the food was innovative and tasty.  Yesterday, we invited two friends to join us for a 7:00 p.m. dinner. We arrived at 6:55 and it was evident that the hostess was a bit frazzled. The bar area seemed full but there were lots of tables in the restaurant area and only two patio tables full. After waiting about five minutes or more, we were seated. No menus - apologies because they were out of menus. Then the next clue came - the table next to us - got up and left after we had been sitting for about 10 minutes and finally received menus. Two glasses of wine took another 10 minutes. Water came right before that. The wait person said the kitchen was understaffed. Not a good sign.  Two larger parties had been waiting with children. Their food finally came. Wait staff came to tables with food and then left because they were at the wrong table. Our order went in about 30 minutes after being seated. at 8:15, someone came by after my husband pointed out we had been sitting since 7:00 p.m. He said that they were \"slammed\" and our food would be out in 10 minutes. 8:30 no - food - only two glasses of wine and iced tea (had asked for hot tea) - we left.  Food had been good the previous times, but the disorganization with the wait staff and kitchen isn't a good sign. When we left, there were very few tables full in the bar. The patio had maybe 5 tables full. This is a sorry state for what was a pretty innovative restaurant. We won't likely be back."}
{"text":"As a general rule, I don't rate restaurants during Restaurant Week (which, in this case, is September 21-29, 2013) because I don't believe it is fair to judge when the kitchen and wait staff are under the pressure of a deluge of new customers ALL ordering the same 3 dishes, at the same time, and expecting 5-star service even when the place is at capacity.  However, I had such an exceptional experience (TWICE) at Renegade by MOD this week, that I must make an exception...  And, before I get to why I am rating the restaurant so highly, I invite future readers to note the date of any of the negative reviews, and if it was during Restaurant Week (or if it says it was) then consider taking the review with a grain of salt (or a whole margarita!)  As I said above, we went twice in the same week, because all four of the entree choices sounded so delicious, we had a terrifically difficult time choosing just two.  Then, after we had devoured the jerk chicken with burnt marshmallow fluff (yes, you read that right, and it is incredible - the sweet/spicy balance is wonderful) and the pan seared salmon, and found them so fabulous, we just had to try the other two!  So we went back again the next night and did just that.  Now that we have had every dish served on the special RW menu (some of which, or variations thereof, are on the regular menu - thank goodness) we still cannot decide which one was better.  The filet mignon was cooked perfectly throughout, the rutabaga mash was just slightly sweet in counterpoint to the savory beef, and the pork belly with peach cobbler elicited orgasmic sounds with every bite.  The duck pastrami appetizer was so good, my husband got it both nights, and is now talking about going for a trifecta.   For us, going twice in a row to one place, in itself, is a huge compliment to the chef, because to give TWO of the precious nine days of RW to the same restaurant, could have been a sacrifice, but it so, so, so, so wasn't.  ....I just had to write in praise, because they earned it!"}
{"text":"Poker Guys' Review.  Six of us visit restaurants new to us every Tuesday night.  This week was Renegade by Mod.  Overall it was a very poor experience.  The physical appearance of the restaurant and the drafting of the menu were the only positives.  It is too bad they did not spend nearly as much time on the taste of the food or the service (though they took their sweet time delivering each course).  The food was ok at best and the service was poor.  Our waiter did not seemed thrilled to be there.  The table remained uncleared for much of our meal (dirty dishes piled around).  The appetizers were the best things we ate there.  Venison lollipops were solid.  Pork bellies were tasty but a bit dry.  90 minutes after we arrived, the main courses were finally served (the waiter admitted there were only two people in the kitchen).  None of our main courses were great.  The highest compliments go to the Big Azz Burger (the name is obviously ripped off from the Roaring Fork).  It was surprisingly juicy considering that they refused to cook it medium rare.  The other dishes were anywhere from ok to poor.  For example, the crab mac and cheese tasted like something out of a box.  No interesting flavors whatsoever.  The desserts were also mediocre.  Our table tried all but one of them on their menu.  Renegade is all form and no substance.  The place looks nice and the menu looks amazing.  But the dining experience was poor and the food incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"I am not one to normally write a review of any kind unless the experience is exceptional or totally unacceptable. Our experience at renegade's was simply the worst food experience ever. My wife and I were looking for a nice evening out and decided to try out Renegade. On the waiter's recommendation I tried the Pork Belly appetizer and the Duck for dinner. I ask for the duck to be done medium. My wife ask for the Scallops which the waiter said were simply fantastic. The pork was good and we looked forward to dinner. When the meal came the Scallops were ice cold. Any amateur could tell they were not cooked at all. I cut into my Duck and the blood gushed out of it. Needless to say the blood taste lingered for the rest of the evening and simply ruined everything for me. Just as bad as the preparation of the food we were seated on the patio and it took for ever to get a server or anyone from the restaurant to acknowledge our issue and return the food to the kitchen. Once the kitchen redid the meal the duck was still not acceptable to me at all while the Scallops were then done to perfection. All in all we will not be going back to Renegades ever again."}
{"text":"We had some delicious dishes.  We had some really bad dishes!  And, we had service from beginning to end that was simply terrible.  Chef O'Dowd needs to fix the front end of his house before he looks on expanding!   Seems to me Chef O'Dowd needs to find himself a small, intimate spot and showcase his highly touted talents.  This simply did not do it.    I felt like we were in a slightly higher end Chili's.  We waited for service.  Every course was served to the wrong person.  We never received bread. We had to ask for our wine flights and were served Char when we should have received a red which we just gave up and drank. Big miss!  One guest never received his desert.    The salmon was special as was the pork belly.    If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd try it again.  But to drive there?  No thanks..."}
{"text":"I love going to Renegade for a drink in the bar. It has got great atmosphere and is not as noisy as many other bars! The 5 stars is definitely for the atmosphere even though I also love their bar menu."}
{"text":"Was eager to eat here because of the executive chef. The duck prosciutto was absolutely amazing! Vanilla and apple creme brulee was to die for"}
{"text":"Being there's no option for zero stars, they get 1.   Came here for lunch on a Saturday with my husband as he had heard about this place in the New Times as one of Scottsdale's top 5 new restaurants.  When we first walked in we were impressed by the decore and murals on the walls but noticed that the whole place was empty except for one other table in the bar area, and it was all downhill from there.   Our waiter had just finished smoking so he was rather fragrant when he greeted us and suggested the quesadilla or the nachos. He didn't give us much time to decide our selections, though whatever we decided would not make an appearance for another 40 minutes or more. My husband opted for the quesadilla and I had the Lobster with pasta ribbons and we split the calamari.   The calamari was decent but arrived 40 min later, and our food was another 50 minutes. The quesadilla was at least edible but the pasta was not. The lobster was old and rubbery and the pasta lacked any flavor other than  a fishy aftertaste. The waiter did bring us a random dish of sliced pinapple which I opted for over my food. I left annoyed, hungry and dissappointed and will go back around the same time as I hire Casey Anthony as my babysitter.  NOTE TO CHEF: I find it hilarious that every bad post for this restaurant is matched by a low blow to the Yelper for \"other negative\" reviews. Be a man and own up to your opportunities instead of making superficial caddy excuses to justify the terrible experiences at Renegade. If you really \"appreciated\" the feedback from customers you wouldn't react by insulting them for providing their honest opinion."}
{"text":"I am tempted to give one star and an \"I don't get it\" comment, just to get that snarky remark from the Chef, but...  Truth be told, great food, and outstanding service!!!.  Went for happy hour just to see.  Had OUTSTANDING apps, green chile, olives, and street tacos, and all were terrific!  Had a look at the dinner menu, and will have a hard time deciding what to order when I return for dinner.  I am a beer snob, and the bar has a great selection of local and regional craft beers.  Love the decor and the vibe, and no, the music wasn't cranked, was at the right volume.    A shout out to our server, Charlie.  And a note to the owners, Charlie is great!  She has a great enthusiasm and passion for the place.  When we do come back, we will make sure to ask for her.  Overall, love the place, the vibe and the concept.  I even think \"I get it\"..."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I had lunch on Saturday.   We were seated promptly.  The lunch menu is limited but we found food that worked.  What surprised me was the place was empty yet our service was slow.  Waitress was talking with other workers in the restaurant while we waited. Did not check in with us regularly, I went and found her to ask to add to our order.  Just seemed to be lax about attending to customers.  Food was ok but nothing to go back for, and the service was underwhelming."}
{"text":"My review is late but my sentiments about my visit aren't.  Easily one of my top 5 restaurants in Phoenix now.  I had the pork belly and I can't say that I have had a dish as good as this in Phoenix before.  Who mixes pork belly with Peach Cobbler unless you know what you are doing???  The service was over the top with our server taking time out to explain the restaurant's concept, the beautiful art posted all over the restaurant and even provided us with a normal menu to take home so we would know what the regular menu offered (went during restaurant week).    This is a restaurant only limited by location.  If Renegade was located in Old Town on the Scottsdale Rd North Scottsdale corridor, they would be one of the most packed places in town on weekends.  That being said, I like the fact that I now have a restaurant that is off the beaten path but better than most of what is on it!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time by myself. I had the Filet, it was pretty incredible! Prices were fine and my waitress Malia was really great...I will definately go back again and next time bring a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I must first preface my review by saying that the BEST burger I ever had was at Renegade before they changed over to MOD.  It was juicy and amazingly delicious!    I ordered the burger and it was dry. I would categorize it as a \"meatloaf\" because it has pork in it and they can't cook it medium. Bummer. The fries were great...but the pickles way too vinegary.  The only reason I am giving the 3 stars is because our server, Loren, was great. He made the dining experience special.  He gets it. Service with a smile even when I was dissing the dry burger. LOL  I WILL be back to try some of the other unique items on the menu. I like the vibe,"}
{"text":"Great urban decor and atmosphere. The menu is amazing. The scallops and the fish in a bag are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chef Michael O'Dowd of Kai fame has revitalized this place, it's amazing again!  The food is innovative but most importantly delicious and the drinks are great.  Now we are looking forward to going back again!!!  The restaurant menu items are great, but the real gems at the best prices may be on the bar menu."}
{"text":"WISH I COULD GIVE 10 STARS!!!!  I have tried this place several times in the past and after a couple menu changes they have nailed it!!  We had the steak frites (flat iron & house cut fries), Pork Belly, Renegade Mussels and Crispy Buttermilk Chicken ( their version of chicken and waffles omg!!)   We all wished we could eat more, the Big Azz burger looked amazing but we were stuffed after the great cocktails from Adam at the bar and the wine pairings Hawley hooked us up with for each of our courses.   If you come be prepared for an elevated experience and a good time. Call ahead for their live music schedule because it sounds like it is always changing."}
{"text":"After some of the reviews, we were expecting the food here to be bizarre or off-the-wall, but nothing is further from the truth... the food is contemporary and -- dare I say it -- whimsical, but it's accessible for everyone.  No need to fear for eensy portions that will make you wanna stop at In-N-Out on your way home or unrecognizable food sculpture... we went away stuffed and satisfied -- no room for dessert.  As noted by many, the decor is fresh and fun and modern. The art was cool, and the artfully displayed bikes are a unique touch -- basically, this is pretty forward-thinking for Arizona, but not for most major cities.  It could easily be dropped into New York (where we moved from). We went at 9pm on a Saturday, so we were able to enjoy a nice bluesy combo playing by the bar -- it would be worth it to stop by just for a drink and to listen.  The service a tad slow, but thoughtful and attentive -- our waiter brought a glass of hot water with lemon and mint -- unprompted -- when he noticed my wife had a cough. (It hit the spot.)  We enjoyed the food -- for apps, we had the venison lollipops and the mushroom dish, which were both tasty (and filling), with a variety of ingredients contributing to the whole.  For entrees, the scallops were a hearty plate, cooked just right, with a fun and tasty churro and yummy sauce -- one of the more unique combos we've had in a while, definitely worth a try.  The fish sticks were very tasty on their own, but I didn't love either of the provided sauces, though the slaw and mac-n-cheese were both very good.  And yes, you get an actual sealed tube of \"toothpaste\" - very clever.  We didn't leave feeling like we'd had a bargain, but we did like the food.  NOTE: a prior reviewers commented on a steak salad -- there isn't one on the menu.  The dish he refers is called \"Reimagined Panzenella Combination\" and the first ingredient is \"black and blue\" steak -- ie. RARE.  Sounds like it was delivered as advertised... at least on the menu. Our waiter still had not tried a lot of the dishes, so it might be a case of the waitstaff needing some more education.  We're gonna be back, if for no other reason than, as noted in the press lately, Scottsdale has a tendency to let anything other than prosaic food wither and die.  We'd hate to lose another one.  Note to the Guys - This could be your date-night spot if you want to look like a renaissance kind of guy. Good food, good tunes, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"The old Renegade was pretty good. Not a whole lot on the Menu, but tasty stuff. Renegade by Mod, really, overpriced, trying way to hard for the cool factor and just plain stupid. It started off by trying a new beer, it was warm. Then, we were served some type of potato soup, compliments of the chef, in a tiny cup, not a single sole at our table could stomach it down. My son ordered a Dr. Pepper, warm. We talked to the waiter about the prices, food selection and what not. He gave a sly smile and said, \"yeah, we've been getting that a lot.\" At least he was honest, We tried to at least find an appetizer before getting up and leaving, but I couldn't find one. My son wanted steak, but saw it was $45, laughed and we all decided it was time to make a run for it. The waiter said, \"yeah, we've been getting that a lot.\" At least he was honest! I guess if your a middle aged biker dude who wants to look cool in a cool looking place, this is the place for you. Maybe, they'll let you wear your du-rag on your nifty head while eating. What a joke, good luck, maybe you'll tap into the Scottsdale wanna be cool crowd, with their big meaty wallets. Sorry Mod, bad food, ridiculous prices and really warm beer..yum.  Geez, get over yourself with the response. It seems that honesty these days is taboo. Very ironic your lecturing me about humility. Seems your ego is getting in the way of your best interests, your customers. Glad you have a loyal fan base, I'm just not one of them. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Loved the original Renegade, but guess I will write this new version off.    Seafood in a bag was average, at best.    Our guest was offended by our edgy waiter (gauges in the ears, tats)."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I *desperately* wanted to love Renegade.  Chef Michael O'Dowd, while at Kai, gave the Valley the most exciting restaurant experience we'd ever had.  The food was inspired, and breathtaking in its perfect execution...  every time.  So it was with great anticipation that we visited his new venture.  Husband and I gave it a few months to work the bugs out, then headed there recently with two of our biggest foodie friends.  7:30 PM on a Saturday night and, although there wasn't a parking space to be found for miles, the restaurant was filled only to about 20% capacity.  That's never a good sign.  The wine selection was pretty limited and uninspired (seriously...  meh.), so I ordered the Dragon's Breath cocktail.  The presentation was awesome, with the drink coming in a little flacon, separately from the smoke-filled snifter.  The first couple of sips were pretty good but, after the smoke cleared, it tasted like a syrupy, generic version of Grand Marnier.  Couldn't drink it.  Our table ordered the pork belly app, the venison lollipops, and the trio of fish tartare.  The pork belly and the venison were both pretty good. Not the kind of good that makes you wake up at midnight craving the dish, but definitely good.  The tartare, which I was so excited about, was a miss x3.  The salmon was bland beyond the telling.  The ahi, finished with chipotle, was so heavy-handed that it killed my taste buds instantly.  The corvina, not normally a fish I like too much, was the best of the three, with a nice balance of salty and smoky.  Entrees were the biggest bust I could imagine.  One of us tried to order the scallop dish but they were out.    So, we had the filet dish, the flank steak, the New York, and the ramen.  Among these, only the flank steak was decent.  The New York strip (my entree) was bland, uninspired, and literally not even worth eating.  The ramen was a disaster all the way around, with overcooked, rubbery lobster, foie gras MIA, and the  broth flavor totally at odds with the rest of the dish.  All but one of us left most of our entrees uneaten on the plate.  I've seen and heard many comments about the service at Renegade.  Our server was friendly and competent but completely uninterested (or unaware) of what a large percentage of food and drink was going back unconsumed.  No, we didn't complain about the lack of quality or palatability, but any decent server in a high-end restaurant pays attention to such things and at least inquires.  I would best describe the service as sterile, and that description translates to the surroundings as well.  I had heard that Renegade was edgy, with an urban vibe permeating both service and decor.  Maybe, if some generic mega-chain tried to \"do\" urban and hip, could you get that feeling.  There was nothing urban, hip, or edgy anywhere to be found.  Maybe the Shea corridor didn't like the vibe and they toned it down already, I don't know.  But we could have been in any of the other 300 boring restaurants in the Valley.  Where was the spark that MOD brought to Kai?  Not in the decor.  Or the service.  Certainly not in the food.  Oh, and about that band in the bar...  They were playing classic rock.  That's certainly urban and hip and edgy.  Of course, they were so loud that we, in the very farthest corner of the dining room from the bar, couldn't hear ourselves talk. (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind loud music at all, but the classic rock thing just seemed desperate and out of place.)  I'm so sad about this experience.  Maybe we hit on a bad night.  Maybe the utter lack of patronage was due to other things going on in the Valley.  Or maybe Renegade just isn't all that,  and the other people dining there last night were -- like our group -- on their first and last visit to Renegade.   Sigh."}
{"text":"The two of us tried Renegade by MOD-Michael O'Dowd for the first time during the fall Arizona Restaurant Week. $30 for 3 courses and 1 of us added wine for $15. to go with all 3 courses. I read  in the local newspaper that they will be doing the $30.00,3 course meals until the end of the year . The menu will change monthly. We had the Shaken Wedge and the Duck Pastrami Bruschetta for our first course. Our second course was pan seared salmon on fingerling potato hash and mesquite grilled filet mignon with lobster knuckles. Our 3rd courses were White chocolate & apple creme brulee & the other dessert we consumed was a bread pudding with cherries,rosemary & bacon bread with an irish whiskey sauce. We loved all the courses and the wine pairing. The decor is a local street artist Lalo Cota. There are bicycle and iron decorations. The patio looked very inviting, but it was still too hot out when we dined there in September. The servers use skateboard trays and other unusual implements. We enjoyed our time at Renegade and will go back at some point,however it is quite a drive from the far south east valley."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, and that's about all I really have to say in a positive fashion.  There is a new chef Mod, the restaurant has been remodeled and honestly it's just too strange for me for me now.  The food is strange, the artwork is strange, and servers using orange skate boards as serving trays is certainly strange! We ordered hummus and expected it to be served with pita bread, naturally.  It was served with a paper thin brown cracker that tasted terrible.  We asked for some bread to go with it instead and about ten minutes later they brought us some wheat rolls.  Rolls???  Also dyed carrot slices on this appetizer - are they intended to be edible? The short rib appetizer is good.  But it is served with a lot of dry crunchy noodles, that you think you should eat because there are so many of them, but soon realize that was a mistake.  Wanted to have some water to wash it down but my glass was empty.  With dark, dark blue water glasses, how can a server tell you are low in the first place?  I mistakenly ordered what I thought was a \"steak salad\", and that's what I said when I ordered it.  I received what the chef calls the streak dismantled, or dismembered, or something to that effect.  It was pretty much that.  Rare steak.  Six croutons on the side and some other \"stuff\".  Sent that back.  Got street tacos and those were fine, but by this time we really just wanted to go.   We were clearly not pleased.  The staff almost apologized to us and said \"yeah, this is a little different menu now, sorry.\" I can't recommend this restaurant, unless you really want to have something different for difference sake.  I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.  At least, it was..."}
{"text":"Went to try the \"new\" Renegade for my wife's birthday.  We were big fans of the old place (the pork stew and the bread pudding were amazing) and a friend told me this new one was better.  I need to find better friends.   The wine list is still evolving they were out of our favorite Pinot but the one they suggested another that was reasonably priced and we enjoyed it,    Asked the waitress for an appetizer to split and she suggested the \"goblet of greens\" which is a large goblet filled with greens and drenched in a green dressing.  The waitress told us most people have a hard time eating it out of the goblet so she gave us a plate.  We dumped the salad into the plate and then picked out the greens from under a half inch thick gob of dressing.  It was OK but way too much dressing.  If it is hard to eat our of the goblet and it is easier to eat on a plate why don't they just serve it on the plate to begin with?  I guess they are big fans of alliteration.   My wife ordered the filet and it was outstanding.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned on a tasty bed of roasted potatoes with blue cheese and other stuff.   I ordered the short ribs and I'm thinking it was the worst meal I have had in over 10 years of living in the area.  The short ribs consist of a few lunch meat thick slices of short ribs over a way too salty combination of bok choy and other stuff covered in a 6 inch high stack of rice noodles. The same guy that puts the dressing on the salad must put the rice noodles on the short ribs.  The waitress gave me a plate to move the rice noodles on to because she told us that customers have a hard time dealing with the rice noodles on top of the ribs (see a pattern?).  The meat was so thin it was tasteless, Trying to cut razor thin meat away from the razor thin bone was way too much work,  The meal was so salty I need to down several glasses of water.  I'll admit it probably makes a nice picture for the website but this meal was awful and way too complicated to eat.  My wife took a bite, almost spit it out because of the salt,  and then put herself between me and her filet so I could not steal any (she did cut me a piece fortunately!).   If I was giving \"artistic impression\" points it would get 5 stars but I am rating it on the quality of the food. I'm giving it 3 stars because the great wine suggestion and the fact that the filet was outstanding.  If I had to rate it on the \"goblet of greens\" and the short ribs alone I don't think I could come up with one star."}
{"text":"This was simply the most bizarre experience I've had in a restaurant in years.  From the minute I  walked in to find no one at the reception desk, always a good sign, to the fact that Renegade BY Mod has no idea what it wants to be.  We were there on a Saturday night.  The bar was full. a party was going on,with biker bar music and a crowd to match.  This was seriously loud honky tonk music.  We were there, however, to eat, thinking this was a restaurant known for  food,not a bar crowd.  The menu has descriptions that require descriptions-shrooms, soil{when\"s the last time you saw soil on a menu?}and sand.   The cutlery is in a container in the middle of the table-another attempt to be different.  Now the food.   The mushroom starter-shrooms - were actually the best thing we had. I had scallops which were far too salty.  My friend had the very thin and incredibly tough short ribs-looking and tasting like no short ribs in memory.  When we told the server he said many people had complained about them-perhaps a good time to re-think them or take them of the menu, yes?  We ordered a chicken dish as  a replacement  for the short ribs.  We waited twenty five minutes.  During this period our  server totally ignored us.  I live in the neighborhood which could certainly benefit from an upscale quality restaurant but this isn't it.  I can't imagine this restaurant surviving nor does it deserve to  with management like this."}
{"text":"Wish I could have reviewed the food but last Thursday we stood at the hostess table around 5:45pm and nobody was around. We stood there for at least 5 minutes and even saw what appeared to be the manager and someone else who works there at a large table nearby just talking. The place was empty as well, there's no excuse for poor service let alone \"no\" service. So we walked out and went to stone and vine.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Venison Lollipops were sooo good.  Perfectly seasoned and tender.  My husband had the ribs and they were also delicious. There was also great live music. Fun time and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I live close to Renegade by MOD and being a foodie I decided to take a couple business colleagues there for dinner.  I had eaten at The Kai and had an outstanding experience more than once, so when I found out it was the same chef I was very excited.  I'm not one to bash anything and am only writing this review to provide some constructive feedback, as if the kinks were worked out it would be exciting to have another great restaurant in town.   When I first walked in I noticed the lighting was very bright.  Bright enough that it detracted from the overall ambience  of the restaurant.  I even asked the hostess if the lights could be dimmed... she just blew off my request.  I struggled to find the right table for our business dinner due to the lighting.  My 2 colleagues and I sat on the back patio and didn't get noticed or served for about 15 minutes.  When the server finally arrived, it was obvious she had just returned from her smoke break.    We all ordered the filet.  The flavor was quite good but the portion (steak, potato, and vegetable) all were very small, especially given the price.    When I have dinner with 2 other people and spend $250 I expect the ambience, the service, and the food all to be excellent.  For a mid-level example, I could go to a chain like Houston's in the Hilton Village and the ambience and atmosphere is spot on, the service and team approach by the servers is always on point and the food is fantastic.    Considering Renegade has a top notch chef, with some hard work they could provide that same high-level experience for their guests.    I'd like to be optimistic and give them another try in a few months, assuming improvements are made."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to try Renegade by Mod having had a lovely dining experience at Kai.  In summary, the food was divine, but the service could be improved.  We arrived to a nearly-empty restaurant.  The musician playing acoustic guitar was very talented and made for a nice ambience.  When we initially sat down we were not greeted by anyone for at least 10-15 minutes.  We started with the venison lollipops and duck bruschetta, both of which were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  My only critique of the venison lollipops is that the venison portions were rather large and I felt a bit \"cro-magnon\" taking multiple bites off the \"stick.\"  For our entrees, I had the Scallops and my husband had the Filet.  The Scallops were impeccable and the accompanying sauce was delicious.  I think I have a thing for squash blossoms - they complemented the scallops nicely.  My husband's Filet was a perfect medium rare, melting in your mouth.  The accompaniments for the steak couldn't be better.  For dessert we had a citrus-ginger creme brûlée which was very tasty and was a nice ending to a great meal.  Obviously, the food is Renegade by Mod's strongpoint.  The service did leave a bit to be desired.  Our server was very pleasant and cheerful, but overall, I expect more from a restaurant at this price-point.  When we left, no one was present at the front of the house to wish us a good evening.  Also, the fact that the cutlery was in a caddy on the table bothered me; a little too \"Bubba's Barbecue.\"  I understand that Renegade is trying to offer superb food in a relaxed atmosphere, but better service and a little more spit and polish would really make for a much improved dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and really enjoyed the food. Ordered the chicken with marshmallow fluff and sweet potato. The chicken and the marshmallow were a brilliant combination. The sweet potato was scalloped and then \"reconstructed\" - while it looked cool I didn't think it was mind-blowing.  I like the creativity of the menu but I think some of their dishes are a little lacking in flavor (my friend's plates were not as notable). We met some of the staff at a Charity event a few weeks later where they had a booth and everyone seemed to be very passionate about the restaurant and what they are trying to achieve. Hopefully that will translate into some great things from this place. Will definitely be going back for more :)"}
{"text":"The food was a total surprise. Excellent. Finally I can say I had a great meal in Scottsdale that didn't taste like it was pre made. The fish tacos actually contained fish. The food was so delicious and fresh. The flat bread pizza tasted like pizza not cardboard. Hope they stay in business and keep the same quality of food. Check it out. Only thing that slightly bothered me was the loud music in the bar. That could be toned down at happy hour. Or maybe different music."}
{"text":"Renegade is a wonderful place to eat.  I went a few days ago and couldn't be more impressed with the food and friendly staff.  The Kobe beef sliders were incredible!  Great place to take family and friends.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience start to finish. We chose Renegade over stone and vine next door because we could enjoy the nice weather on the patio. It took a while to get service. We then ordered tomatoes and sliced avocado for our 2 year old. The manager came out 15 minutes later to tell us they don't have avocado. We then received our meal which had enough sodium to reach my salt intake for the month. After being there almost two hours we finally received the bill. I was pleasantly surprised so gave the waitress my card. It came back and the actual bill was twice the original. This was due to a mix up on the tables. It turns out my 2 year old's chicken tenders and tomatoes was $12. I told the manager about this and he took $2.16 off the bill. We live close by and will not be back. Stone and Vine for us from now on."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...extremely slow service.  Food below average. Sea food in a bag...very poor. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Terrible Happy Hour! The fish, street tacos were horrible and the peach cobbler martini made me want to vomit!!!"}
{"text":"The original Renegade wasn't really much of that, with Robert McGrath trotting out the same old recipes he built his reputation on at the RoaringFork. Don't get me wrong, I loved to stop by for the burger or the green chili stew, and I always loved the ambiance of the place. But if a chef was going to live up to the sign over the door, I think Michael O'Dowd is truly the guy that is up to the task. I dropped by when I heard about the grand reopening last week, and O'Dowd's new menu definitely marches to a different beat.   The eclectic selection starts with the bar. What a fun place to relax, listen to live music and have a drink.  Mixologist John Woo has whipped up some tasty drinks with a different spin. My wife tried the raspberry margarita that has rose petals frozen into an icecube, and her sister had Renegade Punch in a Bag, a fruity but not too sweet mixture that can sneak up on you. The bar food is the first place O'Dowd shows he's not afraid to mix things up. I thought the black bean hummus made a great contrast with the drinks: a course texture of the beans and chick peas that packs a nice kick. The ladies ordered the MOD Sliders (made with Kobe beef and a sweet chili sauce) 'to share\" but after one bite my wife was saying \"Back off sister, these are mine!\". The Chili Verde was tasty and the Venison \"Lolipops\" with Mole were excellent. And the Big AZZ Burger continues the Renegade tradition of the best burger in town. Needless to say, we had our fill at the bar before getting near the dinner menu, but with all the intriguing tastes we experienced, we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and we really appreciate the localism that the restaurant is trying to incorporate.  Local farms for the food, local artists throughout the place, local music,  etc.... This is what restaurants should be doing. We lived in Austin for a few years and loved that aspect of the city so it's nice to see the trend developing here.  I appreciate the effort and the food is hands down amazing.  We started w/ venison lollipops and I had pork belly all by myself w/ blis syrup (considered one of the best craft syrups that u can buy) n peach cobbler.  Wife had the filet and I went duck.  All of it was unique and exactly what we hoped from MOD.  The pork belly dish immediately transported my senses to up-state New York/ Vermont farm communities.  It was awesome.  Loren our server was very knowledgable and explained the concept and gave us a rundown of some events the restaurant is hosting.   We had a great experience and I think that it's vibe n craft is what this area needed badly."}
{"text":"5/23/13  I bookmarked Renegade a few months ago, but didn't have the inclination to go until I decided to try takeout from Stone & Vine and spotted Renegade next door.  I already planned to try Renegade after Restaurant Week ended, so imagine my surprise to find an invitation via text last night to attend today's Grand Opening VIP Tasting!  (I'd just arrived from a terrific RW dinner at Sassi when I received the text.)  I received the confirmation email this morning asking guests to arrive in casual attire.  Arrived before the place started to get crowded.  Spied a couple of old acquaintances, and we decided to sit together.  (Had a great time catching up with you, Chris and Heather!)  Glad we moved to a table close to the musicians playing at the front- Jared Blackstone sang and played guitar, while another would join in on keyboards from time to time.  He did covers ranging from Rob Thomas and Johnny Cash to Pearl Jam and The Beatles.  So good was the music tonight that Heather and I went and bought CDs.  I hope he's on regular rotation at Renegade...  Before moving to the table, we sat at the bar, where Heather and I immediately were given ribbon-tied plastic bags filled with fruit-infused rum cocktails finished with Kool-Aid.  I couldn't have any, so I gave mine to Chris.  At the table, Heather ordered a glass of Earthquake Zin, and I a Rosemary Margarita, which had an ice cube made up of a rosebud and rosemary sprigs!  So delicate and very pretty, yet packed quite a punch! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=_fcCyNNVYAMPDoCmi9NkHw#_fcCyNNVYAMPDoCmi9NkHw  Here's what we sampled...

The first serving I had, I concentrated on the different flavors and textures of the sweet dish-- smoky fennel mixing with the creamy goat cheese, and the nutty fennel pollen amidst the silky goat cheese cream- oh la la!  We were practically begging for more!  When we finally got seconds of it, a server actually brought out a covered smoking tray, stopped in front of our table, waited till it dawned on us what we were about to receive, and then lifted the cover, and out drifted smoke!  This time, the fennel pollen tasted even smokier than the first batch, and then I finally had to stop and shake my head, because darn it, I'm eating out of an ashtray!  I'm sure it painted quite a picture to see me, a non-smoker who abhors the habit (I work in a smoke-infested environment), eating out of an ashtray with glee!  We each took a parting gift of Mole Gold 24K gold-infused EVOO and a set of headphones in a paint can on our way out, and I asked the artist I'd passed a couple of times on my way to the restroom, he had an unfinished canvas next to him, if he was responsible for some of the artwork adorning the walls; he said yes.  He is Lalo Cota, and he's painted some of the murals here, as well as the ceiling of one of the dining rooms, and has done artwork at PHX's District American Kitchen and Wine Bar.   I shall return!  p.s.  Also tried a tough pork belly and two Big Azz burger lollipops (one good, the second not so)."}
{"text":"I went prior to the change then after and I don't see much difference. If you're going for dinner, expect to be disappointed.  Nothing is worth whatever money you spend. The only thing I'll give them credit for is they have a decent beer selection. I would be shocked if this place is open in 4-5 months...."}
{"text":"Looks like the old Renegades is gone and a new one taking over. The bar area is basically the same...although I think they changed the T.V. screen positions, for the better. I ordered the ChiliVerde dish. I thought the presentation was not good.  Eating the dish out of some small tin bucket wasn't appealing to me. The Chili Verde was just okay, certainly no WOW factor here. The corn tortillas were good.  But the combination of the two just doesn't work. My beer was served in a strange water type glass - a Blue Moon.   The music was a bit edgy, but that could be because they're trying to attack a different younger market...c'mon guys, this is north Scottsdale!  The crowd is older and there isn't enough of them to make a market for you.   I'll give you until November..."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because of great service by our waiter Loren.  I had pretty high expectations going into the dinner because of chef Michael O'Dowd and what he has accomplished at Kai.  My friend and I ordered the celebration of mushrooms dish and local produce similar to the one at Kai.  It was good and a good starter to begin our meal.  We also ordered the tartar trio which the Ahi and Salmon were good but the Corvina had a weird taste to it.  I'm not sure if it was because of the olives they used or that combination didn't work well.  For our entrees, we ordered the scallops and ramen.  The scallops were a little small for Diver scallops but the dish itself had good flavor it was a good dish overall but the size of the scallops made it disappointing.  The ramen came and was something we were really looking forward to because it had two of my favorite things foie and truffles.  The foie was a good size and was good but the dish was missing the truffles altogether and I mentioned it to my server and he told the chef and all the chef said was he was sure he put a couple shavings and even some truffle oil in the dish.  If I'm paying $30 for a bowl of ramen it better be special and have everything that I want in the dish.  How can my friend and I completely miss the truffles altogether?  Come on???  I've eaten at so many restaurants and even bought my own truffles so there is no mistaking them in my book.  Bottom line they were missing from the dish completely.  For dessert, our server brought us the bread pudding with Irish Whiskey sauce.  The bread pudding itself had good flavor and texture and was well done but the sauce was so strong it was like drinking shots of Irish whiskey it completely ruined the dish because of how strong it was.  If I wanted to have an Irish car bomb I would have ordered one not have it poured on our dish.  I'm not sure I would recommend the restaurant to anybody because they have a lot of kinks to work out.  I think they need some work on the cocktail list and execution of their dishes before I would go back."}
{"text":"I can't even count how many times my fiancée and I said the word, \"Wow\" throughout our experience at Renegade by MOD. I wish I could say we were more verbose, but I just can't think of a better word. From the decor, the music, the service, and of course the FOOD, everything was just spectacular.   To the people writing the negative reviews: I'm positively thrilled you hated the place. Clearly, you're not the target clientele and I fervently hope you'll stay far, far away. As for myself, I plan on becoming a regular patron and spreading the word to everyone I know will appreciate something a little unexpected.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool and the talented team live up to   the hype. I went in for dinner and was pleasantly suprised by the open mic night which was happening. The restaurant is really interesting and has a lot more to offer than the facade of the restaurant suggests. They have a beautiful central wine room and a cozy patio area in the back. I sat at the bar with adam the bartender who made me feel very welcome. Ryan the manager suggested a pri fixed menu to me, it sounded fantastic and for the price was an excellent choice. The first cuurse was a frisse and compressed apple salad with bacon lardons and was really tasty, the richness of the lardons and the crunch of the apple was a good combination and was just the right portion size to keep you wanting more. Second course was a foie gras and asain spicy slaw sandwich and again super tasty. Foie gras is one of my favorites and this is by far one of the best I have had in a long time. I have never had it before with spice and it was a really delicious and interesting twist. For the entree was a spicy remen noodle with poached eggs and scallops. The scallops were cooked to perfection and it was served in a cute binto box too. If that wasn't enough ryan suggested I try the nutella creme brulee and I'm so glad I did. I would definitely share this but it was prepared perfectly with hazelnuts to garnish and that satisfying crisp top every brulee should have. I would definitely recommend this place for a function or if you want to break the mold and for any foodie that wants to try some of the inventive and out of the box creations that chef Jeremy delivers."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday.  The food was okay but a little too salty for my taste.  The musician they had on Friday night was great. However the service was the worst I've seen.  When we got there the host was confused.  Then someone came and started arguing with him as we waited.  The serving staff seemed drunk and did not know anything about the menu.  We later learned that the staff (about 8 including chefs) had quit on that day.  This place is a mess. The new management needs to get a handle on things or get Restaurant Impossible to come help them!"}
{"text":"Having been to Renegade many times, though the many management changes, I must say they hit it right.   One the downside, the happy-hour menu was quite lacking, we used to bring the kids and share a bunch of small plates.  I suspect they will add more to the happy hour menu.   The main dinner menu is a serious foodie menu. We started with a deconstructed panzanella salad which was incredible. My wife loved her filet rolled in peppercorn (not overly peppered), with home made gnocchi.  I had the seafood in a bag, which is a strange name for an excellent dish.  Finished with the creme brulee with a peach chutney.  The flavors were extremely complex and complementary, everything just worked.   This had fallen off our rotation but we decided to give them a change and were incredibly pleased."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Renegade by MOD four times. I ordered the Twisted Ramen Noodles scented with Lobster Miso the first time. It was delivered with a raw quail egg. The waiter poured hot broth over everything and it cooked the egg to perfection. It was so tasty that I had to force myself to try something else on my next trip. I was glad I did as the Diver Scallops from the Sea of Cortez were perfectly prepared.  My husband's Filet Mignon Rolled in House Made Peppercorn Sand was outstanding.  On the third visit I couldn't resist my urge to order the Ramen Noodles again. What a disappointment. It was delivered with the egg already cooked and after the hot broth was poured over it the egg turned into a rubbery inedible mess. The lobster meat was overdone and rubbery as well.  My fourth trip may be my last. I'm having trouble staying excited about this restaurant. It's a shame because I was so looking forward to having Michael O'Dowd near my house instead of a day trip away. I ordered the two for $20 special which was a salad and pasta. The sauce was so thick it just glommed onto the pasta. My husband's Grouper \"Fish Stix\" tasted remarkably like halibut. Halibut is a fine fish but is not grouper. The dish was nothing to write home about even if it had been grouper. I have the feeling that the chef is not watching the pot and that the kitchen staff is getting by with murder. I hope he wakes up soon and gets them under control because they are making a mess of his creative food. It has the potential to be a great restaurant in an area that could use one."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for their grand opening and was shocked by how not impressive the food was. I hate to give a negative review as a first review and also hate to give a negative review to a place that allowed me to come to their grand opening, but it just wasn't very good. The food they were serving definitely should have been good, for example, they had a kobe beef slider....sounds good, right? No....it was not good. It was ground kobe, not sure why you would grind such expensive meat, and it was covered in a weird sauce and then topped with velveeta. Yes....velveeta. It was such a waste of a good meat, you couldn't taste the meat at all...it could have been ground anything for all you could tell. Additionally, the BF found a bone in his....not so appetizing. They also had mini burger bites, that were decent, but the way they were served made it so you couldn't taste any of the toppings because they all fell off before it got to your mouth (they were little balls with bacon and whatnot on top skewered with a toothpick, so the bacon and things fell off when the burger was picked up). The crab mac and cheese was mediocre and I believe had velveeta in it as well....how weird. The pork sweet and spicy wings were an odd texture and tasted like frozen food. Not good. The only thing that was decent was the spicy mango cone....a mango pudding of sorts with cayenne in it served in an ice cream cone. We ended up leaving after only a short period of time because we didn't want to continue tasting/wasting their food....that's pretty bad when the food is free. Maybe this place just needs to work out some kinks, but it was surprising that they hadn't done so before this event."}
{"text":"Went to the 'new' R by MOD on 7/3 for Happy Hour. We have been coming here since the VERY beginning, and have seen the Ups, Downs, and everything in between. I have to say that the negative reviews are unwarranted----We had a great time, with good food and drinks. Had a Flatbread, the Mussels, the Black Bean Hummus, and probably other stuff that was really pretty awesome. I can see that this place won't appeal to everyone, but hey, that's why there are chain restaurants. To sum up: Good food, decent wine list, creative cocktails, decent happy hour, good music, good service. We'll be back a lot."}
