{"text":"If you love Mexican style seafood, this is your place. The menu is in English, but I've not had a waiter that spoke it.  I don't speak Spanish, but I can point to what I like, so it's always worked.  As with most non-American restaurants, they are mucho kid friendly. They have booths and tables.  The location is unappealing, as is the exterior, but if you live in Phoenix, you're used to it, so take a trip to Mesa for this treat."}
{"text":"Terrible service, disgusting food. Over priced . Waited for food for an hour , got my shrimp tostada and was disgusting , my buddy did not receive his food at all after waiting an hour . And in the process they brought food out for them selves and started eating . Found. If black hair in salsa . Looked pubescent .... Do not waste your time with this place , I won't be able to look at food again for awhile now I'm completely disgusted"}
{"text":"Come on Thursdays. 50 percent off the wholr menu. The shrimp Diablo is amazing and there soup was insane. Everything very fresh. The menu is in Spanish but they were very helpful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible service .not friendly. ..dark and very dirty place warm beer! Really!...definitely  not recommended! Absolutely"}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of food and cheap beer. The dining room is good size, but it fills up quickly. In the evenings they have live music on the stage, and it is even more crowded. Chips and Salsa are good. The fish filet is lightly breaded and very good. They also have the kind that is the whole creature deep fried, but that's not for me! I highly recommend coming on Thursday because it is 50% off all dishes. My wife usually goes every Thursday! Sometimes the service is a little slow, especially when busy. Parking is usually a challenge, particularly in the evening and weekends. Bathrooms are a little scary. But the food is great and worth coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican seafood here!!! Good pricing and half off the menu on Thursdays!!! Never had anything less than great food and great service, will be back often!"}
{"text":"I was really hungry today and I decided to stop in cause I was craving some seafood.  For starters the place is not nice inside or out.  I almost considered just not going but since there was a good review I decided to stay.    I ordered the crab and shrimp ceviche tostadas.  I was totally not impressed.  The crab had pieces of shell in it and the shrimp had no flavor.  The only good thing was the coke in a bottle but I can get that at the grocery store so unfortunately I was very disappointed."}
