The is food masterpiece, if you don't understand good food go to McDonnalds.
Best ingredients of the season expertly cooked, great flavours, great wine, get your butt in one of these seats and get schooled in great food."}
{"text":"Excellent food.
Perfect size for a resto.
Friendly service.
Good music playing.
Spectacular wine list.

...the fact that the place rumbles a bit when the subway runs underneath makes this place even more awesome."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this and was expecting to be wowed.  Unfortunately I set my expectations too high.  The theme seems to be shareable plates, thoughtfully and simply prepared.  A worthy goal, but to me there's a subtle line between \"simply prepared\" and \"I could have easily made this at home myself\".  Things started off well with carpaccio and radicchio, followed by a truly delicious tomato salad, and then started going downhill with slightly overdone quail, and then fairly pedestrian lamb and bland cornish hen (would have preferred to order the sea bass, but they were out). Everything was capably done, but unmemorable.
I can say the service was excellent. Our waiter was pleasant, and professional without being too formal, and provided us with excellent wine pairings for each course.
Because it's such a tight space, other diners can really impact your evening.  We were seated next to four insipid young male \"professionals\" who droned on endlessly and loudly about their $500 t-shirts and 100k credit limits, sprinkling their inane conversation liberally with f-bombs.  Very distracting and unpleasant, and there was no escaping them.  Bizarrely, they were self-aware enough to remark that they were sure the rest of the diners couldn't wait for them to leave.  I think I would recommend trying to be seated at the counter - it looked like people were having a good time there.
Overall, it wasn't inspiring enough for me to return, or to recommend."}
{"text":"A hipster eatery found its way into Yorkville. Expect indoor toque-wearing, and a staff that see themselves as holier than thou. 

Drinks are on the pricey side, even by Yorkville standards. Food is pretty good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. 

Service leaves a lot to be desired as the staff and owners are there more for themselves than any patron. The bartender even left an ounce or two of wine in the bottle after pouring our glasses and drank it himself. Yuck. 

If you're looking for a quaint and independent coffee joint in Yorkville with a good vibe and tasty food, this isn't it. 

High hopes and a huge miss. 

Really wish our experience was better."}
{"text":"After recently eating dinner at Brothers, I left shocked. I will start with the positive..... The food is incredible. Large portions and incredibly flavourful.... It ends there.

 Brothers is the type of dining establishment where if you are friends with the manger/bar tender/server, you are treated like a god. If you don't, be prepared to be treated like an afterthought. I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant. From the cold reception, to the ignoring of us throughout our meal, it was not an enjoyable experience. 

What really topped it off was when the manger/bar tender was mixing vodka cocktails. I inquired as to what he was making and if I could have one. His response....\"DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT CAUSE YOU ARE'NT GETTING ONE. You can only drink wine\". 
Then followed it up with \"Do you want a Negroni? Well you can only have one at the end of your meal. Little kids drink Negroni during their meal\". Has this guy never learned customer service?? 

After this incident I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible. I have never felt so unwelcomed in a restaurant in my life. I have worked in the service industry for many years and this is not how you treat customers. By all means wow your friends and loyal customers, but don't sweep the others under the rug. If you aren't a regular, be prepared to be shunned."}
{"text":"It's a very small space but the food is stunningly good. I had cod with tomatoes and beans, which doesn't sound fancy at all. But words cannot describe the flavors on that plate. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Brothers as it was the #1 restaurant for 2017 in Toronto Life. The service was spot on. We were greeted as soon as we walked in & given our choice of tables. Couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. This continued throughout the whole evening. 
The food was very good. Mains better than starters but not amazing. Not representative of the number 1 in Toronto. 
Not that I wouldn't come back but with lower expectations."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and WOW - we could not have been more impressed! 

We were seated at the bar where the co-owner, Chris, provided great service from beginning to end. Although the space is small - it has an awesome \"NYC\" vibe, almost more of a hidden gem than a restaurant right in the heart of busy Yorkville. We got there just after 5pm and the bar was fully seated with the tables also filling up as we ate. We split the salad, cornish hen, and lamb dishes as we were heading off to see a show. Everything was excellent but the lamb was exceptional! Probably the best I have ever had. We would likely have tried one more dish if we had a bit more time.

If you are looking for a restaurant with amazing food, good but chill vibes, excellent service, recommendations, and pairings...try Brothers! It's perfect for date night, special celebrations, or just because."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8.5/10
Food: 9.5/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 9/10

Definitely was swayed by the Toronto Life article, boasting this as the #1 new restaurant for 2017. I will say that this place has a lot of things going for it and given that they update the menu constantly, why it would make sense to keep coming back!

The food is fantastic, let's get that straight. You can tell there is a lot of thought that goes into each dish and the preparation is technical and precise. Between two people, we split 2 apps and 2 entrees which was perfect. 

The environment leaves me wanting a bit more. Because it is small, most of the seating is along the bar (perfectly fine) but sometimes would want to be seated. 

The service is wonderful and warm. The servers are definitely there to make your experience enjoyable and they are helpful with the wine selection, explaining the food, all that jazz. You get that family sense and that this is by no means a \"corporate\" chain (one example is we ordered 1/2 a litre of wine and they don't measure it out completely - if it's about, even more than the amount, that will suffice).

THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, warm service in a small nook that is a definite one to put on the list (and to go soon!)"}
{"text":"I wanted so much to like Brothers.  The small space feel reminds me of NYC, and how restaurants spurred up in the most tiniest, unusual spaces.  

We came on a Saturday night, called ahead to get a table for 8:30pm.  When we came we were seated at the Bar (which we expected and preferred). I thought the bar would be a cool place to sit and watch the bartender make drinks, however, cocktails does not seem to be something people order often from the restaurant.  The gentleman at the bar seemed overwhelmed, he was serving, pouring wines, taking orders, doing it all.  The bar was covered in dirty wine glasses.  There wasn't any flare to his service, though he was nice, it wasn't the relaxed vibe we were hoping for.  

We ordered the beef Carpaccio, Clams, and Pork Belly.  We also sampled a few full bodied reds as well and settled on one from Spain.

The Carpaccio, was a dissapointment.  The carpaccio was topped with a generous helping of olive oil, fleur de sel, pine nuts, lemon juice and grilled redina.  I thought the Redina was a bit too strong and bitter to pair with the thinly sliced raw beef.  I also thought the lemon juice was too acidic.  

The clams were my favorite of the night, they were cooked in a very light broth, with little nibbles of fresh pasta. It was refreshing and light, the clams were very fresh.  The only down side is that it only came with 10 or so clams, which was kind of expensive ($17) I would've liked to have more clams, once you de-shell them there is not a lot to enjoy.

Pork Belly was also okay, it was served up in a creamy sauce, I think for a main the dish was lacking.  There were a few pieces of pork belly, some small potatoes as well.  Visually the dish was unappealing.  The creamy sauce could have had more interest.  It was just okay. 

Service:  The service is lack luster.  The dishes and components aren't explained to you once the dish comes, it's kind of disappointing that they don't do this because on the menu the descriptions are vague. They don't change the cutlery and plates for each portion of the meal which was kind of annoying granted we had clam juice all over our plates for the night. The server doesn't make an effort to interact with you at all.  What I find insulting also was that when we told him the carpaccio was a bit heavy on the lemon juice he asked us if it was the first time we've had a carpaccio. He also said they need lemon juice to cure the beef which is untrue.  you don't need to \"cure\" beef for beef carpaccio, maybe if you were making a seafood ceviche you would but not with beef.  Sorry I found his comment to be inappropriate and snobby.  I don't need to explain I've had dozens of carpaccio dishes to make my criticism valid that's just silly."}
{"text":"This is a much hyped spot that didn't live up to expectations. Reservations were strongly recommended so called ahead and confirmed (text to reconfirm is a neat touch though am sure it would be cumbersome if one uses a landline yes some people still have those)
The place is cozy so I understand the approach towards a quick turn over (more on that later)
The menu is limited and wine list was OK. Though I feel they need more wine by the glass if one wants to try multiple wine or wine that pairs well with a certain dish.
After a bit of deliberation we settled on a rose' and a blended red wine.
Here is a play by play on the food:
bread and better: yes you read that right this comes recommended. Hmm guess what either it was I got the wrong edge but the butter on the salt packed a wallop to the extent that I had to gulp down water and wine to for a lack of better word rinse it out.
Olives: Served warm a nice variety. Decent app to go with the wines
Carpaccio: Oh boy the salt saga continued as the piece I tried was overwhelming with salt. Pine nuts were good, radicchio was OK. It needed more seasoning as well. The olive oil was quite good. Mediocre dish
Beet, yogurt and bread: Decent with a nice crunchy fried bread.
Mackerel: I didn't try this dish but wasn't liked by the fellow diners. 
Sweet breads: I enjoy sweet breads so order them once in a while. Hmm didn't enjoy this version. A very heavy dish and should pair well with a more robust wine but I think the button mushrooms overpowered the main attraction.
Now for the service hmm I didn't enjoy it as found it pushy to say the least. I think they are geared towards table turnover so this approach makes sense. I however feel a wine bar should be to enjoy food, drink and talk and linger around. 
2.5 stars and that's pushing it at this price point."}
{"text":"Not so impressed by their service, like many yelpers have commented. They do show very friendly service to people they know, but wouldn't more smiles for other guests be nice?

Wide range of wine choices, but I just don't have the mood for drinks with that kind of service.
The rabbit saddle with creamed spinach was flavorful. But the rabbit tastes like chicken to be honest.
The gateau basque was delicious. 
Probably wouldn't return in the future."}
{"text":"Smug hipster vibe from both the clientele and service with delicious food.  Very cramped if sitting at the counter.  The server did not know that    some items were sold out when taking our order and fortunately the customer  eavesdropping sitting beside us updated the server.  I would eat there again only if I was in the area, not really worth the trek from north of the 401."}
{"text":"I feel that ever since I've come back from Paris, I always compare the quality of a restaurant to the best ones I've been to in France. Few come close with the exception of a handful I've gone to so far. Brothers has a small, simple and ever changing menu that really sets the standard very high.

Being the biggest bread lover you know, let me tell you that the bread they start you off with at Brothers is DIVINE. The crust was perfectly crunchy while the inside was moist and fluffy. I can't truly describe to you how joyful it makes me to have GOOD freshly baked bread. They serve it with a side of salted butter for an extra bonus!

I've tried 3 main dishes.

There was a braised rabbit gnocchi special that day which I could not have been HAPPIER about. I LOVE pasta and have a crazy gnocchi obsession so it was just my lucky day.  I'm not a fan of eating rabbit, but honestly I couldn't say no to gnocchi. These were the SOFTEST, little flavourful pillows!!

I also tried the quail with honey and olives. Such a simple dish where the ingredients came together in perfect harmony. Of course I made sure to soak up all the honey sauce at the bottom. Lastly I had the steelhead trout with Jerusalem artichoke, watercress and beurre blanc. The fish was cooked to perfection with a nice cripsy skin, which everyone knows is the best part!

A small, SIMPLE menu where the dishes will exceed your expectations. Trust me when I tell you that this is a MUST do restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this spot.  But I am not sure why the service is so severe.  No one smiles.  There is no warmth in the service.  Is this a thing?  Anyway they were prompt with orders and drinks.  We had the apple endive salad, pork belly and risotto.  The apple endive salad was quite good but I am pretty sure It would have been just as good if I have assembled it myself (apples, endive, walnut, blue cheese and light lemon dressing).  So thank you for reminding me of a salad combo I should revisit at home.  The pork belly was good but again not really anything I could not have made at home except the potatoes that came with it. It was magic.  Creamy and dense.  Yum! It should be a dish on its own.  And the risotto was again good but nothing to sing home about.  I think they focus on fresh and local ingredients so that is amazing but personally maybe a bit more experimentation of those local flavours?  The subway does rumble angrily under your feet occasionally but the decor is very modern and sleek so you don't mind so much.  Will give this and thee try in the summer...maybe."}
{"text":"Brothers was recently named one of Canada's best new restaurants by enRoute magazine so I had to check the restaurant out. 

The restaurant is located above the Bay station. The space is small but intimate. It has a chic and casual feel to the atmosphere. The decor has a New York feel.  

The service was attentive and friendly.  The food was innovative and creative. The dishes never came out the way you would expect it to. Our table shared the following dishes:

(1) Sea Bream Crudo;
(2) Quail;
(3) Beets; 
(4) Sweet Bread;
(5) Trout; and
(6) Pork Loin.

All of these dishes were delicious. My favourites were the crudo, trout and pork loin. The ingredients were fresh. The dishes were simple but elegant.  The dishes also paired well with the wine that was recommended to us by our server which only enhanced our experience. 

I would recommend Brothers if you are look for a restaurant with a little character and serves great food."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try Brothers for dinner before heading to see a movie at the Manulife Centre. It's a small place, tucked right beside Bay subway station. At a first glance, it reminded me of the Gabardine meets Richmond Station (both of which I have enjoyed).

Stepping inside, the restaurant is quite narrow. The bar seats about 16 guests and there is an (ugly) pink banquette along the back, which seats 4 more tables. Because the restaurant is narrow, the tables at the back receive little to no light, as the only window is a narrow one located at the front. The back of the restaurant is lit with unflattering yellow incandescent bulbs in frosted white globes. No candles, no accent lights, no outside natural light, nothing... which created a very poor ambience. The blinds at the back were completely drawn.

The menu changes regularly - my friend had called a day or two ahead to inquire, but was told that the kitchen did not know the menu ahead of time.

We split the lamb kofta appetizer. It came with 3 koftas, which were juicy and tender. It was served with mushrooms (well cooked) and artichokes (overcooked) and topped with yogurt. The yogurt curdled and there was some separation, which looked like vomit and was unappetizing. That being said, the dish itself tasted okay.

For mains, we ordered the rabbit and the braised lamb. The rabbit was the better of the two dishes. It was cooked with a brown butter type sauce which had a good flavour. However, the meat was a bit dry and almost chicken-like in texture. The dish was served with parsley dumplings, which were really more like Tim-Bit sized pillows of slimy, gummy dough (think like gnocchi gone wrong).

The lamb was braised nicely - the meat was quite tender. However, it was gamey and very fatty. It was served with thick slices of quince and some whole pickled onions. I felt that the quince and onions did not complement the dish at all. The quince was overcooked and mushy, and the acidity of the pickled onions felt out of place. 

All of the dishes were severely lacking in colour. Everything was a drab brown, with drab brown sauce. Not visually appealing.

Service was nothing special. It was a bit slow. The server wiped the table of crumbs/spills after each course and provided a change of plates and cutlery, which was much appreciated. However, he also asked if we would like a refill of bread, which we said yes to, but the refill never arrived. Water fills were also infrequent and the water was tepid, not cold.

We didn't even bother to stay for dessert; we were so disappointed.

Definitely spend your money somewhere else. I will not be returning and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday night for dinner with a friend. We loved the food. Our server was knowledgeable about the wines. Dishes were explained in more detail when they arrived. 
We were open, and let the staff choose our entrees for us. Service was great, we felt well-attended to. The space is small but they use it well and we did not feel cramped at all. We could hear each other from across the table, which was a welcome change to some other dining experiences I've had in the city. Looking forward to my next time at Brothers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Brothers to celebrate my birthday. I'd give it a 2, but because my husband liked the food better than I did, bumped the rating up to a 3. 

Their reservation system needs to improve. My husband played phone-tag with the restaurant for two days, which was annoying. You have to leave a voicemail (no online reservations) and wait for them to call you back. Slightly inconvenient, especially if you have a job where you can't answer your phone all of the time. 

I also don't like that they do not have a menu online. I understand that it changes (and I like places that do the same), but if someone has allergies or food preferences it would be nice to see the \"menu of the week\" on their site. Many other restaurants (eg Union) post their menu daily. 

We arrived on time and were seated right away. Service was quick- we didn't wait long to have our order taken, and the wait for our food was reasonable (not super quick, but not too long). 

Beef carpaccio- beef was tender and delicious and roasted veggie that came with it was good- BUT the dish was drowned in oil to the point I didn't want to eat it. If I had known, would have asked them to go light on the oil. As presented- it was way too oily to enjoy. If they used 1/5 the amount of oil (or less) it would have been much better. 

Mackerel and eggplant with mint- the mint made it interesting. But the cost/portion ratio was too much for that type of fish. And the mackerel was dry, despite it being an oily fish. 

Sweetbreads- tender, my husband loved them. He thought they were prepared well. I thought they were okay. 

Halibut with olives- again I felt the fish was a bit dry. The potatoes \"scales\" were semi-attractive but didn't add any points for taste. I guess I just found the fish uninspired and I could make something better myself at home for a quarter of the cost. 

Wish they had cocktails and a bigger wine selection. 

My husband said he'd go back, but I wouldn't. I just feel like there are so many better restaurants in the city. 

Think our bill (with four glasses of wine) came to $180 plus tax/tip, which wasn't bad. But we were both hungry later that night."}
{"text":"Ate at Brothers last night without the benefit of reading any reviews beforehand. A friend suggested it, so off we went.

I read reviews this morning and noticed that my experience was entirely different than many of the posted reviews. Here are a few highlights:

1. The space is intimate and indeed right over the subway. It has a subtle elegance, yet is not fancy or elaborate. If you have less than 4 guests in your party, you will be seated at the bar. The noise-level is not so high that you can't have a full, relaxed conversation.
2. I encountered no toque-wearing hipsters. Most people were dressed in business or business casual attire. The crowd was a mix of all ages. I suspect that you would be welcome here even if you had on casual clothes.
3. Service was very good. It was not gushing or over-the-top, yet it was efficient and professional. Plates came out reasonably fast, and I never had to ask for more of anything. While they did place the receipt on the bar in front of me, I did not feel rushed.
4. The food is excellent. I had a Spanish mackerel crudo and a red peepers appetizer. Both were tasty and perfect for an appetizer- not too heavy. For the main I had a perfectly-cooked sable fish and a dish of pasta with mushrooms and artichokes. I would go back and have the same thing again without hesitation.
5. Super wine list too. If you like a light red try the Gunther Steinmetz Pinot Noir from the Mosel Valley.

Brothers is a great option for a nicer, casually-elegant meal."}
{"text":"We had very high hopes for this place but it is +++ overhyped.  

The good:
-Cozy and interesting atmosphere
-Friendly sommelier who made a good recommendation 
-The steelhead trout we had was delicious with crispy skin, delicious sauce and cooked perfectly!
-sour dough bread very nice
The olive oil used to dress the carpaccio was fabulous

The meh:
-service was very spotty and inconsistent
-had to really try hard to get the servers' attention
-no one came to take us through the menu.  It would have been nice to hear more about the dishes and menu specials which we later sadly overheard them tell another table after already ordering our food 
-carpaccio came as one large piece making it difficult to share
-the mains with the exception of the trout were fairly lacklustre
-the rabbit cavatelli pasta:  cavatelli was undercooked and overly chewy, rabbit was overcooked and leathery
-food temp was lukewarm and not sufficiently hot 

If every dish was like the trout this review would be very different.  We were disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"If someone else is paying for your meal GO TO BROTHERS. I don't even like wine and they convinced me. Seriously, if your partner is paying or your uncle or something, suggest this place. It's worth all their money!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. I've been twice and have yet to get something that I don't absolutely love. 

The halibut salad, sweetbreads (my favourite), rainbow trout, and head cheese frisée anchovies are all amazing. The beer and wine menu is carefully curated and there desserts are also great.

I live around the corner and this has become a place that I go to squeeze in a meal at the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner here the other night! We had resos for a Friday at 6.30PM and sat at the bar. Friendly service, and really appreciated the wine recommendations as well as being able to sample the wine before buying a whole glass. Lots of wine by the glass listed on the menu, plus additional bottles were open so the server offered some off-menu selections, too. Food was fantastic - we had the halibut with potatoes and greens, a beet salad, and tortelli pasta stuffed with spinach and ricotta - really nice, really fresh-tasting. (Make sure to ask your server for details on the dishes as the description on the menu are very brief - definitely ask if you have allergies.) I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went because it was hyped up by blogto as the top up and coming restaurants in Toronto. Frankly I don't see why. The food was mediocre. My girlfriend and I ordered all 4 of the main courses (pork belly, halibut, Cornish hen and pasta). The halibut was the best but uninspired. The Cornish hen had a chance of being good but was ruined by an overpowering butter sauce. The porkbelly was not crispy and the pasta was pedestrian. Everything was way too salty. 

Also the server either didn't seem to know the menu when we asked questions or didn't care to answer in detail. He didn't seem to care. \"It's good\" is not helpful or an adequate answer when the description consists of just ingredients."}
{"text":"overrated. service was sub par.
beet salad tasted like it came out of a tin can, with some yogurt on the side, afterthought.
My main, the sausage, was very tasty, but stood on it's own, with a very bland base (sorry, but the risotto failed).
The wine list, given the Yorkville location, appeased to many palates, but missed the mark on Ontario wines.
Overall, I enjoyed the presumed thoughtfulness but was very dissatisfied with the prices vs. quality.
The service lacks majorly; one of the owners/Chef, I assume, greeted me, but from there, the service went downhill,
as is so typical in Toronto.
So many steps of service were missed, or perhaps, not a focus, given the recent accolades.
Overall, a disappointment.
There are far better restaurants, serving far better quality dishes, providing far better service, in just as accessible neighborhoods in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very nice and unique restaurant situated in yorkville. Our server who was also working behind the bar was very friendly and professional. Must have: the rotollo!"}
{"text":"I'm bummed to see the first two reviews of Brothers are negative ones, because I love this place!! It's become my new favourite spot. This is my first Yelp review, ever. I hate how often times the only reviews that get written are the negative ones. So I felt the need to even it out. This place deserves 5 stars.

First off, I've tried many dishes and all of them have been wonderful. It's so fun being able to order many small dishes and try a variety of things. The mackerel, pork belly, and gnocchi were highlights. I've been 4 times now, and it has been consistently so good!

Courtney, the Som is superb and has so much knowledge about the wine. They are constantly changing their wine by the glass offerings which is nice. 

The atmosphere is small and cozy. The seating in the front window is lovely for people watching. 

I really can't say enough good things. Go, check it out. You won't be disappointed. Disregard the other reviews."}
{"text":"Really great food. Felt like a secret restaurant. The dusty rose touches in the decor were kind of right AND ridiculous at the same time. Will go again."}
{"text":"I was rather nervous going in here after reading all the reviews about the staff being nasty - I didn't find that at all. I found the staff attentive and knowledgeable. The lady on the bar recommended some great wines for us. The food was beautifully prepared and presented. I had mackerel and olives with bread, then steelhead, all of which was excellent. They have a really well curated wine list, and the staff know these wines well. The room is lovely and fresh. Great spot. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"Don't believe in the other reviews here. I came here Saturday night before reading the Yelp reviews and I can't believe what I'm reading about the customer service.

- firstly, we walked in 40 minutes late and the waiter laughed and sat us at our table and gave us sparkling wine to help us settle in. 
- the waiter was knowledgable, explained the food and was super nice and actually really funny.
- the chef came over as well and shot the shit for a bit and wasn't pretentious.
- they know the menu well and for someone who is picky with customer service, these guys nailed it
- i trusted them so much we let them order half the meal for us- enough said!

most importantly the food:
- fucking delicious. i think i had the best halibut i've ever had. 
- the menu is different everyday depending what they can get in from local markets. 
- gotta love a restaurant that creates the menu the day of service. 
- food was fresh and flavourful. 

check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I so wanted to go here and have a nice lunch, but they're a bit too full of themselves. 
Menu looks great and the food is probably fantastic, but we didn't get to stay.
we entered an EMPTY restaurant and were asked if we had a reservation, which we did because we know, we get it. 
We were sat at the worst seat in the house. The end of the bar by the service door. I asked about the empty tables and were told they were all booked.  Cool, I get that in theory, but it would be nice to have been told when we reserved by phone to a human that the tables were booked.
We looked at the menus and I thought about ordering the gnocchi. We were served some water but when he came back to see if we wanted drinks, we said we needed a minute because we weren't sure yet if we would stay.  We actually needed a minute to decide if this suited us today (young parents and so rare is the occasion to go out to eat I wasn't sure I wanted to be an extra at the hipster cheers with overpriced wine)
Anyways right after we said we were still deciding the bartender grabbed the menu from us and turned away.
Cheers and GFY, you're not special brothers."}
{"text":"It's literally been less than 10 minutes since I got home from Brothers; my second meal here over the past couple months.

I was super impressed the first time we came -- so impressed, in fact, that I wanted to withhold a review until I'd had a chance to try it a second time, just to make sure it truly was as good as I thought. I rarely do that, and am happy to give a 5-star review for a one-time visit. In this case, the experience was so exceptional that I needed to make sure I hadn't dreamt the whole thing.

There's no point going over the dishes we ate in excruciating detail, since it's unlikely anything will repeat as the menu is small and they change things up so often.

The food here reminds me of an upscale British \"gastropub\" -- the kind you'd actually find in London. It's simple at its core, and very hearty, but with a bit of a twist. (I've read one of the chefs worked at St. John, which my wife and I visited -- which after having the food at Brothers, is not surprising.)

The staff are fantastic. The first time my wife and I ate here, we sat at the bar, where one of the owners, Chris, served us. He was super helpful in terms of wine and food recommendations (FYI they have one of the most interesting wine lists in the city [Gut Oggau and Meinklang!] and an awesome policy of pouring glasses from anything on it), and was also hilarious in his own way. It turns out, from our experience tonight, that service at the tables is no different. I especially appreciate our server steering me away from a glass of Arbois Poulsard (which I really wanted to try) with my steak (which I, in the back of my head, realized would overwhelm it) and selling me on a much pricier, but fabulous, Brunello.

Anyways, I'm gushing now but I think Brothers really can make a case for being the best restaurant in Toronto. It's not fancy, it's not avant-garde, but it's just really, really, really, really, really, really good."}
{"text":"Was at Brothers today for a Visa Infinite lunch.  Spectacular food - some things off the menu like their superb Sea Bream Crudo.  Special dishes like ham they cure themselves from suckling pigs from the Gaspar farm in St Jerome (and a Suckling Belly - you cant go wrong with Pork Belly) and an excellent Butter Poached Cod.  This isn't their usual menu but the menu was a testament to the skills of this kitchen.  Awesome.  Great wine pairings thanks to Halpern Wine Enterprises."}
{"text":"I found the staff amazing and very knowledge and attentive. I don't know what the other reviews were talking about. Those reviews seemed unnecessarily mean spirited. The food was next level and the place was packed! I had dreams about everything I ate."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to leave this because I almost didn't come in based on the Yelp reviews... and I'm glad I didn't listen! Got here late on a Friday-- other kitchens in the area had closed and they agreed to still seat us. Everything was delicious. Highly recommend whatever crudo is on the menu. Tomato salad zomg. Our small plates were perfect. Mains of lamb and cavatelli-- flavors of sauce for cavatelli were special but the way that the pasta was cooked and integrated into the sauce could have been better. Lamb and its sides were really flavorful. Oh, and the bread and butter? Yes, please. 

Sour cherry tart to finish was perfect. They're more of a wine bar but have some great beers available-- was super happy to discover the kumbquat saison from Burdock. 

Would come back if ever in the area again. 

(PS both of our servers were A+)"}
