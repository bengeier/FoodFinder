{"text":"We got the dumplings, spring rolls, pad thai, orange chicken, and onion pepper chicken. Everything was very good. Take out order was easy through yelp and they had everything ready when I showed up. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on my lunch break one day.. and it is awesome. Their service is quick and friendly. I've had the yellow and green curry lunch specials and both were great! Love the black rice and soup they serve it with, too."}
{"text":"Place was very clean and the food was great.  Didn't plan on going here but have passed it before. Glad I stopped in and will be returning. The summer rolls were awesome!"}
{"text":"We're so happy we discovered Vegan House! We had Thai iced coffee, yellow curry, and chicken with spinach, all vegan style, of course, and were very pleased with the portions, spices, and overall quality of food. We ordered the yellow curry with medium spiciness and it was pleasantly warm without being overwhelming. The chicken with spinach had a flavorful peanut sauce that went well with rice.

Speaking of rice, all of the curries are accompanied by Vegan House's custom red rice mix. Similar in texture to wild rice, we thought the red rice had a nice substantial texture and pleasing nutty flavor.

The folks working there were very friendly and the place was spotless. Before the check arrived, we found ourselves discussing which dishes we'd order on our next visit. If you like Thai food, Vegan House is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I came in a group with 6 meat eaters, and we all left happy!!! Everyone loved their dishes. They were nice enough to let us substitute steamed tofu instead of fried tofu. 

The Thai coffee was delicious! I also loved my green curry-- it was spicy enough (I said medium), and I enjoyed the red rice that it came with."}
{"text":"Not only is it excellent Thai food, it's vegan! Excited this is nearby me so I can try more plates. The lunch special is reasonably priced and I left really full. The yellow curry was nicely balanced with potato, carrot and tofu. It's a peaceful place to sit and relax over lunch."}
{"text":"I went recently with friends to celebrate my birthday and we had a very nice time.

I really appreciate the very clean, modern and creative decor - offers an upscale café feel.

For apps we ordered the summer rolls to share - OUTSTANDING!  Honestly the best I have ever had - the texture of the nonmeat protein was so awesome, great fresh flavors and the two sauces they serve it with or over-the-top good!

For entrées my non-vegan friend ordered the jungle noodles and loved them.  My other friend and I both ordered the pumpkin peanut butter bowl - she loved hers - me not so much :(. I found the dish to be way too saucy and thick for me and my vegetables were overcooked.  I hate to send anything back but when I explained to our server she was very nice and apologized that she thought the chef had gotten a bit in the weeds in the kitchen - she quickly ordered up a lighter dish, spicy ginger stirfry I think - The vegetables were cooked crunchy it was light and super delicious - a perfect second try!  The purple rice is one of the best offerings, and it's the standard rice they serve - love it... The portions are big, right on point for what you pay... Nice to have the owner stop by with her baby to see how we were doing and chat with us at our table for several minutes.

I will absolutely be back for some more summer rolls and to try some other dishes - even my carnivore friend said she might give it another try... Thank you Vegan House!"}
{"text":"So excited to learn about another vegan restaurant in Phoenix, so we thought we'd try it out and see how it was. 

Vegan House has been open less than a week so we expected some bumps.  However, everything was pretty amazing:  the food, the customer service and the ambiance.  

We started with an appetizer of vegetable dumplings.  A good appetizer for one, but too small a serving to share.  It was so good!

My husband ordered the \"shrimp\" clay pot and it was delicious!  I ordered the Praluck - grilled mock chicken over a bed of spinach and brown rice with peanut sauce.  YUMMY!  All the ingredients were fresh and homemade in-house.

Speaking of homemade in-house, we had the fried bananas with coconut ice-cream for dessert and it was absolutely delicious!!  It was so good.  They make the ice-cream there and it was perfect alongside the warm fried bananas.  Definitely coming back for this!

Our server was friendly and went out of her way to help when our toddler was having a tough time sitting in the booth.  They didn't yet have high chairs in the restaurant but saw our difficulty in keeping a toddler in one place.  So she went to a nearby restaurant and borrowed one of their highchairs!  Amazing!  The highchairs are coming soon.  

Our family will definitely be back!  Welcome to Phoenix, Vegan House!"}
{"text":"Went here based on reviews. We waited an hour for our food and it just wasn't that great. Patrons were looking at each other hungrily as we all waited for something to appear-for anyone. I don't know what was going on to be honest but I am telling you. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the roti with vegetables. The vegetables were tasteless and the roti was deep fried and dripping with fat. To make the whole thing worse it was covered in syrup. Not remotely healthy or tasty."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time with my younger sister. We were both excited to try a new vegan place and were not disappointed. We ordered the fried rice and the orange soy chicken, both were so yummy! The lady who works there was also pretty great. She was very friendly and patient with us. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Thank you vegan house for being awesome. 

The lady who helped me was very nice and helpful. The food was delicious.

If you are in town I recommend you stop and try this spot out. 

I had a hot green tea, the seaweed tofu soup and the Orange tofu with the brown rice. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it even though I was way past my limit. I didn't even feel guilty afterwards. 

Yum."}
{"text":"this is the worst place ever!!!!! its been a long time since i received bad customer service!!!! would not recommend this hole in the wall to no one!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The green curry, spicy fried rice and fried sweet potato and taro were amazing! Would highly recommend for vegan/non-vegan/vegetarians. However, they get very busy and took an hour to make our takeout. It's better to call ahead at peak time"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great service as well! My husband and I agree this is the best vegan fish we ever had. The vegan chicken was good as well. By default, they provide healthy Thai red rice instead of white, which is an extra bonus. We will definitely be coming back even though it's quite a far drive for us."}
{"text":"I did the online order to pick up. I get to the restaurant about 50 mins after I placed my order online only to have the girl tell me my order was still going to take another 10 mins. She told me she had been busy all day and hadn't seen the order. Maybe they should have more than one person on the floor or do away with online ordering if they can't handle it. Very disappointed. I would have left but I had already paid on advanced."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the food was rich and amazing! Perfect if you love the texture of meat but want a plant based diet. We all had leftovers! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Had the Thai iced tea with soy milk and pad Thai with vegan chicken it was so flavorful and absolutely delicious! Definitely will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is delicious! Came here three times during my visit to Phoenix, food is fresh and very flavorful!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pineapple fried rice with mildly spiced tofu & veggies, and a side order of veggie rolls.  The dipping sauce for the rolls was amazing!  I almost swallowed my tongue.  An all around delicious meal indeed."}
{"text":"My word what a fantastic meal!! Jungle noodle is amazing! You'd never know it was vegan unless you were told it was. Well that or look at the name of the restaurant. Hehe. Highly recommend this this for any one, vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, very filling! Friendly staff and great decor! Very good vegan fish wrap and tea! Also the seaweed and mushroom and tofu soup is very good!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great vegan coconut ice cream with fried bananas. Welcoming soothing music. Expansive menu. Delicious healthy. We will return."}
{"text":"We landed just after lunch time in Phoenix on a Sunday. My first choice in vegan restaurants was closed, so we ended up at Vegan House which was near our hotel. We started with the summer rolls, which were a little disappointing for the price and size of the appetizer. I think that $8 for two small summer rolls is quite overpriced. I couldn't really taste all the ingredients listed. They were decent though. I ordered the orange soy chicken, medium spicy. Vegan orange chicken is kind of \"my thing\" and it's hard for me to not order it when I see it on a menu. It was very good, not over-fried, and the spice level was exact to my preference. I also liked the mixed grain rice it came with. My companion ordered the soy chicken wrap. It didn't look that great but she said it was pretty good. The fries were less than thrilling. When I tasted them, they were very bland and perhaps not quite cooked enough. I would pass on the fries there. I would've gone back and tried something else if I'd been in Phoenix longer and if my non-vegan companion had seemed more thrilled with her meal. The service was very pleasant, attentive, and friendly."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the food is fresh and delicious and the service is good. You don't have to be vegan to eat here. It's my favorite place in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food. The pumpkin curry with tofu and veggies was divine, and the fresh spring rolls were delicious. The portions are easily big enough to share. Thank you! Will be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and the food is always so yummy! Even better when you don't feel sick after eating. I often even play a game with the waitress where she picks something and doesn't tell me what is. Nice surprise. Everything is good here."}
{"text":"The service is always great! I like going during my lunch break and during that time it is not busy at all. Their pumpkin peanut yellow curry is amazing! I love it and I feel so happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. When you order it spicy, they make it spicy. The food and the service were great."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food because the driver cussed my voicemail/text message out so bad I was too shaken up to eat. Awful delivery experience from EAT24."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out after the reviews on Yelp. Overall it was nice, but a bit salty. I loved the tofu veggie wrap, but I would try something other than the shrimp clay pot next time. My other non-vegan friends have also enjoyed this place and there seemed to be quite a few regulars"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. This is a good place to go with friends."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit. Although I've only been here a few times, what I have had was absolutely enjoyable. The mock meats are good for new vegans, non-vegans, or anyone really. They have great variety and choices for the whole group. Service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of very tasty dishes!!  Fantastic service.  We tried several dishes and each was wonderful. Amazing soy \"chicken\" product in the drunken noodles!!"}
{"text":"So awesome! Very friendly staff, awesome food and so filling too! Price is very reasonable considering it's vegan food that needs certain ingredients that can be expensive, especially the mock stuff. I'm very impressed. I was just trying to find a place that I can eat and I have found it! Definitely coming here when I visit. Oh and make sure to try the homemade coconut ice cream with fried banana (kinda like banana lumpia)"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food! Had the green curry and the pumpkin curry. Both outstanding and I consider myself a snob when it comes to vegan food being that I've tried dozens of vegan spots. The summer roles are delicious too as were the sweet potato taro. 

Great for vegans and non vegans looking avoid the meat sweats. 

A little pricey but worth the few extra bucks for this amazing food. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place & boy am I very pleased! The atmosphere in here is so relaxing. Very clean & modern space. 

The service was very good & they accommodated both wheelchairs.

I had the fried rice with salad & soup. The soup was amazingly delicious. Full of flavor! The rice was a little spicy but was very tasty. 

I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and Sedona and found Vegan House right here on Yelp.  What a gem!   Seriously delicious food. 

I had the Pumpkin Peanut Curry which was SO amazing.  Rich and flavorful, I couldn't even finish half of it.  If those flavors are your thing, you've got to give it a try.  My husband had the green curry, which was also quite tasty.  We also loved the brown/black rice combination served with each entree.  

Our server was the sweetest girl who was very knowledgeable about the menu as well as attentive.  If you're looking for a wonderful little place to enjoy flavorful vegan food, this is it!"}
{"text":"Omg! Best Asian Vegan food I've had! I highly suggest the veggie pot stickers and the orange tofu. Out of this world delicious. Plus the servings are nicely portion so you can get a few dishes and share with friends. I suggest getting there before the dimmer rush, the place is small and can fill up fast."}
{"text":"I tried the Orange Soy Chicken and Jungle Noodle with mock chicken and they were both delicious!! The breading on the chicken had the perfect crunch. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Very happy this place exists and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Vegan house really enjoyed my meal here came down at lunch time decided to start off with appetizer the vegetable spring rolls were absolutely delicious for my lunch meal I had the hot spicy tofu  vegetable stirfry rice that was absolutely delicious very clean establishment friendly atmosphere nice and cool dining area. If you're thinking of going vegan or just simply like vegan food come here it will Not disappoint."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Vegan House that it was my first stop in Phoenix. I came on a day that was extra slammed because of a juice convention happening nearby and more than a normal amount of plant based people in the area, so the service was a bit messy and slow. 

The food didn't impress me the way I'd hoped either. I ordered Jungle Noodles with vegan shrimp, and the flavor was just meh. The vegan shrimp looked like real shrimp, but tasted more or less like nothing. I dined with someone who ordered avocado rolls that were essentially summer rolls with a little avocado added. There wasn't much avocado, so it was mostly greens wrapped in rice paper. She also had the orange chicken, which I tried and that was pretty good.

Despite an average lunch, I decided to order for dinner because I couldn't find a lot of vegan delivery options near my hotel. 20 minutes after I ordered, I got a notice saying they had canceled. They apparently decided not to use the delivery service anymore and never told anyone. I was disappointed and wasted a lot of time since I had to order something else.

When everything is added together, I am just meh about this place, but I do like that there is an all vegan option in downtown Phoenix, so 3 Stars it is."}
{"text":"Order the pumpkin curry with tofu and veggies. AMAZING!!! 10/10 recommend. The rice isn't a tradition white rice, but it's still good. The veggies are well rounded and the tofu was fresh. The flavor was very full and I can confidently say one of the best curries I've ever had. Compares to Panang Curry. Delish!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Went here because a friend is vegan but as the other reviews say, it's good regardless of dietary restrictions/preferences."}
{"text":"Love it!! Great place.. great location close to convention center.. great food... loved the veggie pot stickers!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't find this place until 2 months before our move! For my first time, I ordered the Jungle Noodles with soy chicken from the lunch menu on Friday. The dish had great flavor and I loved the quality of the soy chicken.  I enjoyed it so much that I went back today and had the regular order of the Jungle Noodles. I'll be back as much as possible in the next few weeks!"}
{"text":"This was the only place open on Christmas Day and we were starving. We were in town for a health convention (Pathways to Health offering free healthcare to Phoenix) and needed to eat quickly before going back to volunteer. I had the praluck dish and my husband ordered the pad Thai and rice noodle soup. My friends ordered the orange tofu and the chicken supreme. The food was all delicious and the staff worked extremely hard to get our food out to us on time, even though they were packed. Delicious vegan food with decent portion size! We would totally recommend this place. They also have brown rice!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is fabulous Thai food and don't let the fact that it's vegan scare you. The shrimp looks and tastes like shrimp and hey no cholesterol! Spicy and tasty and not as oily as some Thai places. Super nice people work there as well. Great prices and portions!!! As Arnold says...\"I'll be back\" ... And he's even promoting veganism!!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Came here for lunch and there was a wide selection of Thai-esque food. I ordered Buddha's Delight with Soy Chicken. It was delicious. I added a ton of chili oil that was well flavored and not overly spicy. The rice was purple but very tasty and cooked properly."}
{"text":"Well well well! I am pleasantly surprised! I am always on the hunt for vegan restaurants and am glad to have finally tried this place out. I ordered the thai tea boba and drank it so fast it was gone before my food even came out! For entrees I ordered the dumpling curry and my husband got the pad thai. I was so excited that I had left overs so that I could experience my food again for lunch the next day. I think this will be a good location for us when we're in Phoenix and want a quick, cheap vegan lunch. Although the indoor decor is nothing fancy and a tad on the 'hippie' side, I hope people will give this place a chance! Parking can probably be limited although we got the meter spot right in front mid-day Sunday. Also, make sure you close the front door all the way! The poor guy had to keep running to the front to pull it shut to conserve AC. Thanks for being an all-vegan restaurant! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"A fantastic Asian-style Vegan restaurant!
This is a reasonably sized place that seats roughly 50 with about 5 booths and 10-15 tables. The decor is great. Parking outside is city parking at $1.50 an hour. I went on a Sunday night and was seated immediately.

I started with unsweetened iced chrysanthemum tea which was very refreshing. For dinner I had the Buddha's Delight with soy chicken. It's a mix of veggies, soy chicken, and their house sauce. It was satisfying and not too overfilling. House sauce flavor was fantastic. 

Overall service was very fast and the waitress was very pleasant."}
{"text":"My goodness, I can't believe I didn't discover this place sooner. I do think the name \"Vegan House\" might be deceiving for some as it doesn't really have any implications that it is soley Thai. Three words: pumpkin peanut curry. I'm salivating just thinking about theirs. It's so good! Also their spring rolls are a great appetizer to try- huge and bursting with flavor including mock chicken (I'm usually not a fan of mock meats but I was really impressed with how this tastes) on lovely rice paper.
It would be nice if they served alcohol but luckily they are in a location that's close to bars to hit up after. Adorable little restaurant and extremely friendly staff. If you are vegan or appreciate vegan options and like Thai food, I think you'll appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not from Arizona, and so nice to find a vegan restaurant while on vacay. The orange soy chicken is a must!"}
{"text":"We love finding yummy vegan food!! The Pad Thai with soy chicken, and the Pumpkin Peanut Curry w/tofu and veggies (the tofu was a bit soft for my taste..,next time I'd get the soy chicken). Still, everything was delish, including the fried bananas with coconut ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Tried the seafood spaghetti

Very bland - part of the fun with vegan is making healthy food taste good 

At 13 bucks I can do this at home! Good option though but needs stronger execution.."}
{"text":"I called to place a pick up order for Yellow Curry with Soy Chicken and Veggies. Medium spicy. The woman on the phone did not ask for my name, but when I arrived she knew it was me! Very impressed with this. 
The curry was very flavorful and had nice color and veggie quality was great. The medium spicy wasn't very spicy, but it did have a slight kick. The entree came with rice. This was definitely enough for 2 meals. I will visit Vegan House again and I am looking forward to trying more of the menu. Parking can be tricky."}
{"text":"First I'd like to state that I am not vegan. Had my mother and sister not wanted to go here I would have never given this place a chance because I love meat too much. However, after the first bite of their orange chicken tofu (mild spice optionally added) I was hooked. Their house fried rice with broccoli was just as good. They tasted better than any real orange chicken and chicken fried rice I have ever had. I will be going again although, since I'm no talented cook who can remake such masterpieces, I will only be eating vegan when I come here."}
{"text":"Service here is painfully slow. Took over 10 minutes just to get some water to drink. We ordered lunch specials and the soup and salad took forever to get to our table... we asked 3 times about it and the Asian waitress would just smile and nod, and walk away. No help. I ordered the fried rice and it was not very good. They used (for some crazy reason) short grained rice. That is NOT the type of rice you use for fried rice. It was chewy and the veggies were undercooked as well, so they were extra crunchy. I was not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"The food is fresher than the fare you'll get at Green, but more expensive. They're fast, friendly and clean. I've had the green curry dish and the fish filet. Both are solid meals, but as I said - expensive. Parking is a challenge since it's downtown and you'll have to pay even on weekends."}
{"text":"This was close to my hotel. The prices are great, and the food was wonderful. It is vegan with an Asian flair. The mango and black rice dessert was excellent."}
{"text":"Great staff with good service that serves up wonderful curries, tasty sandwiches, and wraps. I hope to return here and try more dishes. Many look exciting. We had a to go order and the server brought us glasses of water with ice and lemon slices while we waited. Very kind. Give this little place a chance. This includes non-vegans and non-vegetarians too. Omnivores-hell, all nomnomivores, will be sure to enjoy the Asian dishes, such as the yellow curry, as much as the vegans and vegetarians because Vegan House does them so well."}
{"text":"Good solid vegan food.  We ordered the potstickers, I had the peanut noodle with tofu and veggies, and others in our party ordered the soy orange chicken and the tofu soup with vermicelli noodles.  The potstickers and dipping sauce were a great start to the meal, with a complexity of flavor and a nice crunchy texture.  The peanut noodle dish was really heavy with a lot of sauce, but still tasty...if you order it, just be sure you're in the mood for peanut!  I was able to split it up into three meals since the portion size is so large.  The orange chicken was really delicious, with crispy \"chicken\" and very sweet sauce that complemented the savory flavor nicely.  I tasted a little of the soup and it was a standard soup, but the vermicelli noodles were neat."}
{"text":"Service here is SO slow... What's odd is that on the day we went, there were at least 4 people in the kitchen. The dining room was not crowded at all, but we still had to wait over half an hour for our food and it was incredibly unclear exactly what everybody's job was supposed to be (servers stepping in to work the deep fryers, a lot of casual conversation and standing around, etc). When we asked for our order to go because we couldn't wait any longer, it took another 15 minutes for the order to come out. 
When we finally sat down to eat, the meal was disappointing overall. My salad was swimming in dressing, and my fiancé's sandwich had way too much vegan mayo spread on it and was very bland. 
I am normally pretty forgiving about kitchen delays, but I felt like the situation was not handled well at all. The server we had barely spoke to us at all and took a long time to respond to any requests made of the guests. Additionally, I felt like they kept staring at us and they seemed to be acting weirdly. 

In short, I would say this restaurant is not worth the wait. We were very disappointed by our experience."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! I ordered the summer rolls and the orange soy chicken. Wow. The summer rolls were wonderful and really could have been a meal by themselves. The veggies were crisp and fresh. The orange soy chicken was delicious. The orange sauce was yummy and just a little spicy (just the way I like it). The serving size was perfect.  I am in town for a conference a couple of nights and am already planning how to get back to Vegan House!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not a vegan by any means but I love all foods! So this review is based on my non-vegan's experience...

I had: L8 GREEN CURRY (Green curry with coconut milk, onion, bamboo, bell pepper, eggplant and sweet basil with tofu or chicken and rice) and for dessert: BANANA IN COCONUT CREAM

The Green Curry dish was very hearty and big enough to share. It wasn't so much green, more like yellow curry, but not really an important detail, right? I liked that the tofu wasn't soggy, only done by baking the tofu prior to adding to main dish, very important when using in a soup or broth based dish. Wasn't spicy at all. Soup was't full of the listed veggies, I could've had a bit more.

The Banana in Coconut Cream was very basic but good. The banana was ripe enough to sweeten the dish. Not a pleasant color, in fact if you judge food by how it looks this might turn you off, it's just very colorless, reminded me of cement before it hardens and is very soupy. It has a light taste but only if you share.

Restaurant is open on the weekends and into the evening which is a big plus for those downtown type of nights and weekends. Be prepared to pay for parking since there isn't any free nearby parking."}
{"text":"Oo-we! Vegan House was exceptionally good and they had a lot of excellent choices. I tried the \"Chicken Supream\" (sic) and it was REALLY good. Our server was super polite and spoke in broken English. But that didn't stop her from making this a superior dining option. The prices are a little above average but the food certainly is worth it. I loved the complimentary soup. Tasty! I will definitely return here"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and was searching for vegetarian Chinese food. This place had a lot of mock meat options. Everything I ordered was good. The sesame chicken, potstickers, and the peanut noodle. Would definitely return if I find myself in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great vegan asian fusion food and generous portions. I have loved everything I have tried. We found this place 3 weeks ago and have been back every weekend since. Even my non-vegan spouse couldn't say enough about how much he loved the Orange chicken. It is even super easy to get to with a light rail stop super close!"}
{"text":"Me and my partner are new in the vegan world and we're pretty excited that we found this place. It was 45 minutes until closing time (which we thought we can just order and go if need be) and we walked in and they immediately walked to the front door as people are eating and said \"SORRYY we're closed\" a bit rudely. I'm sorry but what kind of service is this?... not to mention their OPEN sign was on and it closed at 9pm who closes a whole 45 min before hand. I have never been turned away from a business before, especially when you are trying to give them your money. So it's great that everyone else thinks they're friendly wish I could've found out. I may try again in the future, not sure as of yet. Will find another vegan place to dine at. Feel free to share some other vegan eats if possible in the Phoenix area :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Local Vegan Food, in Downtown Phoenix. Quick service, big salad. Cold Ac - yummy deserts and great place to meet friends before heading out for a night on the town."}
{"text":"Loved the environment and the food. Definitely love that Arizona is opening more vegan friendly restaurants. This is a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix! Only complaint is that there was only one waiter and it took forever for us to get our food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and even if you're not a vegan you will enjoy the food here.  I had the green curry dish with chicken tofu for $9.00 and quite honestly I couldn't tell the chicken tofu wasn't real meat.  The food was well prepared and service very fast.  I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"So delicious!  The kids and I went out for a quick dinner...the taro and sweet potato tempura and edamame starters were great.  I don't remember what the sauce was but it had peanuts and tasted a bit like tamarind (my kid says tangy peanut sauce).   My daughter had peanut noodles with soy chicken (which she liked), but what we really, really, really liked was the yellow curry.  It was fabulous.  I ordered it with the tofu - it came with carrots, potato, onion, and brown rice.  Yum!! We'll be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I miss thai food so it was great to find a place with vegan green curry. I asked for extra hot and it was more heat than flavor but still really good. The tempura appetizer is big enough to share and the vegan shrimp is so realistic that it made me uneasy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything me and friends have tried has been amazing. Super nice and friendly staff. I actually have to talk myself out of eating here every day! haha! I am vegetarian, but my friends are not and they still love it. I've done the delivery for busy days at work and they arrived at exactly the time the email said they would, food still good and hot."}
{"text":"Our food was quick, fresh, and hot. The Green Curry with \"chicken\" was sweeter than I expected, but delicious. My friend also enjoyed their sandwich. The place and the food has a fresh and clean feeling that made for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I can die happy knowing I've reached the summit of faux meats. It's Vegan house. Also delightful employees."}
{"text":"delicious food! I got bbq pineapple fried rice to be safe since it was my first time trying it out and I was NOT disappointed. Taste was on point and everything was fresh made. My only complaint would be kinda oily, but you can expect that when eating out. I will definitely come back another time when in the area!"}
{"text":"I love meat.  Beef, pork, seafood, I love it all.  That said, my appreciation for the valley's vegan and vegetarian community over the last few years in particular has grown by leaps and bounds.  The lengths to which many of these restaurants have gone to make carnivores like myself feel right at home is pretty awe-inspiring.  I'm not sure if they're all hoping to transform me into a meat-free man (not gonna happen), but if their goal is gaining acceptance as a viable and desirable option for dining out, count me as an advocate.  Such is the case with Vegan House.  An Asian restaurant serving a mostly Thai menu, but not a single animal was harmed in the making of your meal.  I was in the neighborhood for a late lunch on Friday so I decided to stop by.

Vegan House is located on Adams Street halfway between Central and 1st Avenues right in Downtown.  The interior has a pleasant mixture of wooden furniture and wooden accents inside with both table and booth seating available.  The place can seat upwards of 50, but as it was a late lunch, I was one of only a handful of customers so plenty of seating to choose from this time around.  I was greeted very warmly by the owners upon my arrival and they were over the top friendly all the way to the end.  

I first received a small cup of warm vegetable soup in a miso broth.  A nice gesture and it was a nice clean soup, though honestly the broth was a little flat to me.  For my main course, I went with one of the chef specials on the menu.  The Fish Of Three Flavor had me curious from the first reading.  Tempura vegan fish and steamed veggies topped with a sweet chili sauce and served with rice.  The presentation of this dish was colorful, albeit slightly weird looking.  Came with two rather large pieces of this faux fish, and the way they were formed almost looked like someone stacked two giant pancakes on top of each other and then sliced them in half.  Fortunately, the taste wasn't nearly as peculiar as the appearance.  The tempura batter was excellent and this faux fish really did have the texture of a light flaky white fish.  I asked my chili sauce to be low on the spice scale (I'm a wimp with spice, sorry), and I really liked the mix of sweet and heat.  I poured on some of that rice a little at a time to soak up every last bit of that sauce.  For dessert, I turned to the FBI.  \"Say what?\" you ask?  That's the moniker they use for what the owner described as their most popular dessert item.  Fried banana with a side of coconut ice cream.  Four battered and fried banana slices, a big scoop of the ice cream and a few dollops of mixed berry sauce.  It wasn't too sweet, but a delicious combo and probably one of the healthier desserts I've had in awhile.

Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to about $27.  The price point was pretty fair given the portions I was served.  Not everything I had was a home run, but everything was certainly served to me with utmost earnestness.  And every dish was a good honest effort to make every meat-free item as flavorful as possible.  Nice people, nice restaurant, good food, fair prices.  That's something carnivores and vegetarians alike all want out of their dining experience.  Props to Vegan House for continuing to expand my horizons on meat-free pleasures."}
{"text":"If there was one thing that I appreciated this place for more than any, it was the two words \"Thai spicy.\"  Whereas most places with potentially spicy food stop at \"spicy\" this one admits there is a whole other level which should be on all menus.  I got medium in peace knowing that it was the second tier of a four tier spectrum and it delivered the promised spice for once in my Thai food tasting life!

I also enjoyed the free soup that I was told came with \"pretty much\" every meal on their lunch menu during their lunch special.  While I found it a bit thin, it hit the spot while myself and my new co-worker (and replacement) who I was in Phoenix to train waited for our main course.

And what a main course it was!  Getting the orange fake chicken at a Thai place was a risky choice.  But they made it with such care that the orange flavoring was on every single morsel of fake chicken.  And it was a delicious sauce that, while it overpowered the protein, did not make me mind on bit.  In fact, the very large bowl of rice they give you on the side ended up being an orangey mess of rice goodness.

Even one that I could not finish.  Since my hotel had no refrigerator (but it did have a microwave weirdly enough), I could not take it \"home\" for a snack but I certainly would have had I been spending my own money and not my company's, .  While the prices here are decent, it does lean slightly towards the pricey side.  Not for downtown, necessarily, but overall.  Still, worth it."}
{"text":"Went two days in a row and hand two completely different experiences. Both times, the food was very good. However, the first day, I was in, seated, ordered, and served food within 10 minutes of walking in the door. I was given great customer attention and served the check without having to ask. They were close a full house but not quite. I went the same time the next day because I needed to grab food and get back to a conference quickly. Took 50 minutes to get food. (The person with me was never served their meal). People around me were meatless. One gentleman at the next table actually left mid meal, I suppose he didn't like the food? I'll chalk it up to a fluke but. E warned."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good for downtown phoenix
Like Buddha delight
Very zen
And they stay open into the evening"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a vegan restaurant near my work. I've got take out and dined in and have never been disappointed. It's awesome to be able to eat orange \"chicken\"again! When I get the take out, the sauce is in a separate container so the food doesn't get soggy. The chicken has a nice light tempura fry to it. The spring rolls are great and have a homemade feel."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Was able to find parking right in front. Not very busy at 3pm on a Sunday. Lovely service. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is great! I went here during a lunch break from jury duty for a quick bite to eat and ordered the yellow curry lunch special which comes with soup and salad. I ate every last bite! Service was excellent as well. I definitely recommend this place and can't wait to try some other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Kudos to the courageous who open a vegan based restaurant. I've been waiting for this to open. Weary business traveler trying to maintain healthy eating. Highly recommend. Delicious and super nice folks. Had the green curry which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"It was probably not good that I had tried the superior Veggie Village the evening before (review: http://bit.ly/2uJzEZT), but this place was only a block away from my hotel. Just so you know, convenience is important when temperatures are hovering around the century mark for this climatically fragile Californian. I was pretty amazed at how desolate downtown Phoenix became after 5PM, but I wanted something relatively light for dinner before exploring the First Friday activities up on Roosevelt Row. It was pretty empty, and the server scurried over to me to make sure I didn't get away. She said to me, \"I hope you know this a vegan restaurant.\"

Considering the name, I told her that yes, I was aware and looking forward to trying their food. They certainly offered plenty of dishes on their menu like Spaghetti, Green Curry and Pad Thai. I started with the $12 Shrimp Salad with vegan shrimp tossed with onion, tomato, avocado, cucumber, and lemongrass, all of it mixed in a spicy lime juice dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/2uJwuFt). It was a good, fresh salad, just nothing extraordinary when it came to flavor. I decided to complement it with the $5 Steam Mix Vegetables, which was your typical variety of steamed vegetables - zucchini, carrot, broccoli, green beans, and a lot of cabbage (photo: http://bit.ly/2uMXbHF). It was what I needed.

FOOD - 3 stars...the ingredients are fine but the execution leaves something to be desired even for this flexitarian
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...clean, just nothing special
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...they seem to try
TOTAL - 3 stars...flavors can be elusive in a vegan place"}
{"text":"The Clay Pot Shrimp was amazing, I would definitely recommend this place for relaxed date or meeting of friends. The atmosphere is definitely cozy and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"Needed to eat meatless for lent, so this was a great option and alternative to the usual seafood and pasta options.  I saw many reviews mentioning that the soy chicken is good; I agree.  Two of us had the Pad Thai with the soy chicken and one had the jungle noodles.  I thought it was pretty good, but the jungle noodles was lacking somewhat in flavor.  Vegan House is a good vegan restaurant, but if you're not vegan or don't have a reason to not eat meat, you may not care for the meat substitutions.  My mother is a super picky eater and she liked the soy chicken pad thai, but if it hadn't been lent, she probably would not have eaten here."}
{"text":"I liked what I ordered and the place is very clean. They have a lot to choose from and there was nothing off limits for me as they do not serve meat. I would return!"}
{"text":"The chicken club sandwich was a bit dry, a bit tasteless  I was disappointed, perhaps next time I'll try some of the other Thai dishes. Gave it 3 stars because I have high hopes"}
{"text":"We have been vegan for 2 1/2 yrs & always looking for new restaurants that have vegan options. This was unbelievably fresh & the most delicious Thai food we have ever had the pleasure to enjoy! Great lunch sized portion & even the salad was tasty! We will be back, just wish it wasn't so far from where we live. Kudos to Vegan House, impressive!!!"}
{"text":"The hardest thing you will have to do is picking out what to eat as their menu has so many good options.

The vegan shrimp is a real experience, the texture is quite unique and it worked with the pumpkin peanut curry, another unique dish. 

The Seafood clay pot was a ginger shotgun blast to the face, full of veggies glass noodles and mock seafood.

Other dishes like the green curry were great as was the fried tarro. Another nice thing is that this place is nice, clean and modern and a bit more formal than most veg places in town. If you have a vegitairian or vegan date this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Maybe I went at a bad time, but waited 45 min for my to-go lunch. Had to refill the meter several times. The lady at the counter was very nice, but when I checked my bag, 2 things were missing. The rolls and pot stickers were delicious, skip the roti w/vegetables."}
{"text":"I'm here for a conference and wanted some place to eat for dinner. I chose Vegan House based on the reviews, and I have to say that it deserves all the praise. I ordered the orange soy chicken, and I thought it was delicious. I'm not vegan, and I have to say it was pretty convincing mock meat. Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian, I think this dish would satisfy you. 5/5 Would come again."}
{"text":"I had no idea Phoenix was hope to such an amazing vegan Asian restaurant (thought Loving Hut was as good as it got, which is decently healthy food that doesn't always provide the hearty unhealthy goodness we sometimes crave). 

This place had incredible tempura selections - the grand tempura dish is neat with all the variety you could want. The tempura soy chicken was my favorite, followed by the onion and shrimp. The tempura pepper was a little weird, but still an overall solid dish. It's hearty and not the healthiest fried option, but doesn't make you feel totally gross like other fried food. The sweet potato and taro dish is also great for a fatty starchy craving.

The pad Thai was okay, but the portion was smaller compared to the tempura. Same with the summer rolls; decent but nothing to write home about.

The fried banana and coconut dessert was super tasty, but would have probably appreciated it more if we hadn't eaten two other tempura fried dishes.

Will definitely be back for all my unhealthy savory Asian food cravings!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday. Definitely more different than any other Thai food I have ever eaten. Fried rice was colorful and okay. Spring wraps were bland. Vegetable dumplings okay. Edamame bland and I had to add my own flavoring/salt. Compared to other Thai restaurants downtown Phoenix I give it the two stars. Also, expensive for the quality of food product."}
{"text":"I am not at all surprise with such amazing reviews for this place! I came to Phoenix  for work and ended up eating at this place multiple times! Believe me you won't miss anything in taste and flavors if you are vegetarian! I tried green curry, red curry, noodles, pad Thai - and loved all! Must recommend this place for vegan, vegetarian and meat lovers too! 

I enjoyed lunch more than dinner since it's better value for money but you can have any meal and taste is same!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find! We loved every dish we tried! We shared the potstickers, the grand tempura, the shrimp salad, shrimp in the claypot. All so good and flavorful! We can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after a health expo. The business was selling food at the expo but took cash only. I noticed the business was located down the block from the convention center so we headed over.  The services was amazing. Our waitress, Tak, was so friendly and welcoming. The food was stellar! They serve a pan-Asian style of vegan food.  I can't say enough about the experience and we will definitely be back. Make sure to try the Summer Rolls."}
{"text":"I was just visiting Phoenix and walking from city scape back to my hotel when I came across this place unexpectedly. I stopped in and ordered some taro & sweet potato fried appetizer to go and when I got back to the hotel I ate it boy was it delicious!!!! I would absolutely go back there if I'm in the area again. So good!"}
{"text":"I've had the veggie rolls, grand tempura, orange soy chicken, praluck, and ppc. All of it was amazing."}
{"text":"The service was great, friendly staff, however the food was pretty disappointing. We had the fish and rice with steamed veggies, as well as the spring rolls which lacked flavor and presentation. The food was pretty blah, and I eat out regularly at Vegan restaurants. The fried bananas tasted great but they were so heavily breaded and oily that I didn't really enjoy it. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"It is hard to find healthy food when you are traveling. Vegan House was a wonderful find in Phoenix. I loved the pot stickers and Orange tofu - very tasty. I got my food to go and was very happy with the service."}
{"text":"The food was great, husband didn't even know it was a vegetarian restaurant. Great flavors."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on my review. The food was amazing and so was the service. My only problem was that I'm allergic to peppers and I absolutely asked for my food to come with no peppers in anything (sauces or big chunks), and she repeated it back to me, so I thought all was good. After getting my delicious smelling (and tasting) meal, I ate some and noticed little red pepper bits throughout the sauce, so I couldn't continue. It was super uncomfortable all night from the allergic reaction from the food. I'd absolutely go again, but I'd have to be even more clear (I guess?) about my allergies?"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food. Unfortunately lots of fried options, however I found healthier selections. And you can make some custom additions/changes such as adding more potatoes.
Nice dine in atmosphere. Really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the find. The menu was expansive. I'm gluten free so I had to have my meal without sauce but the veggies were steamed perfectly and so fresh."}
{"text":"food is ok, but it is too noisy inside. Also you need to wait a long time to get your food."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh!  Very cute place in downtown Phoenix.  We tried the vegan chicken yellow curry and noodle lunch special.  Next time I'll try the Thai tea as well."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Animals - House Of The Rising Sun)

There is a house in Phoenix
They call the Vegan House
And it's been the place of many vegetarians
And boy I know I'm one


I like to first start off by saying I'm not a vegetarian.  I came with a friend to try it out since he's in transition with his diet.  

It was chilly Friday evening has we fought for parking in downtown Phoenix.  Vegan House is definitely Thai inspired but they also offer up some spaghetti and salad dishes.  I was debating whether to order the Clay Pot Chef's special or the Pumpkin Peanut Butter Curry.  In the end the waitress convinced me to go with the curry.  Needless to say, I love peanut butter and pondered how the pumpkin part would fit in.  However, it worked in it's own weird way.  Peanut Butter fans here's your kind of meal; creamy and sweet with a hint of pumpkin aroma and taste.  I could totally eat just the curry without the potatoes, onions, and tofu that was mixed in.  

In the end, Vegan House deliveries good vegetarian food for the downtown crowd.  I'm not a fan of Veganism simply because I feel limited sometimes when it comes to selection of meals.  However, if it's your thing then Vegan House will definitely fancy you! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Coming from out of the area, having a gem like this is a rare find! Everything was fresh and service was great. 

I haven't tried vegan fish before and I don't believe I will again, but the variety and flavor was superb!

Needs a bit sharper decor to match the caliber of food!!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan. I eat anything and everything. I just love to eat. 

I was in downtown on business and was looking for a place to eat lunch. This place came up on search and since my colleague also cares about health, I thought this Asian vegan food might be good.

They do get busy for lunch but not too long.

Green curry was served with tofu. Curry had a very nice flavor to it, I became a fan of green curry. 

Lunch is served with soup and salad. Soup was a bit salty for my liking. Service and food was good except the soup.  Next time, I would order dinner menu."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, a wide variety of options, all vegan, friendly staff and cheerful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Completely awesome if you're downtown very good selection of dishes very friendly staff would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I had the green curry with tofu. It tasted like normal green curry anywhere else. They did not screw it up. If you are vegan, then this is the place for you! Food doesn't taste terrible. 

Of course, going back to flavor, it wasn't extraordinary. More like... you did it as it should be. Nothing special. But yeah! Win for vegan food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a recommendation from a staff member at the restaurant I really wanted to eat at for lunch but that had just closed. 

I won't lie my mind was on chicken, so coming to this vegan restaurant wasn't on my radar AT ALL, but I was starving and trying to be open minded. 

There were only two other patrons in the restaurant when I arrived so I was quickly seated , given a menu and ordered. 

I decided on some dish that reminded me of drunken noodles with tofu. 

My food arrived hot and steaming much to my delight. I eagerly dug in and was surprised at how flavorful the food was. 

The tofu was cooked perfectly and the vegetables were yummy. I asked for just under Thai hot for spiciness level and it was perfect! 

All in all I really enjoyed my vegan lunch and will keep this place in mind whenever I come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! You will not miss meat or dairy. I was shocked that the vegan chicken tasted really good in the green curry. I would eat here again and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Amazing food... Amazing service... Homemade coconut ice cream to top it all... Vegan and gluten free food which is very difficult to come by just one at a time we found both in one restaurant... We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"It's really good vegan restaurant. Thai foods are really good. I had chicken wrap and Buddha smth was really good"}
{"text":"Vegan house has completely changed my view of vegan food. I didn't think a completely vegan meal could be so delicious and filling. My favorite item on the menu is the orange soy chicken. It's possibly the best orange chicken I've ever had. I look forward to trying the rest of the menu. Next up is Pad Thai with vegan shrimp."}
{"text":"We just tried this place today for the very first time, and we loved the food. It was delicious, and it even looked beautiful. My husband, 10-year-old son, and I all found something great on the menu. It was a bit on the pricey side, but it was high-quality, healthy, and yummy. Try it!"}
{"text":"Okay the Thai team and soy milk is wonderful and refreshing! The veggie pot stickers are a must! The veggie pot stickers are probably my favorite thing on the menu. I got the fried rice as a main with the soy chicken It was soggy and soft. Not the way I like it. I would recommend asking for extra vegetables and steering clear of the meat substitutes next time. If you like things spicy you are going to have to ask for hot or thai hot. I ask for medium and got mild. The Green curry is also a great dish. Cant wait to come back for the veggie pot stickers."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Loved every bit of their savory food. Staff was very friendly. Pot stickers are to die for and the atmosphere is quite relaxing. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Yeah, let's give a hooray to the Vegan house and that damn fried rice with orange tofu., which mimics Chinese orange chicken. 

You can drive pasted this place if you blink. It's in the middle of the block on Adam street in downtown, Phoenix. 

The food is very well thought out and put together.  But you better bring some $$ this place isn't cheap, but it's not super experience but its vegan food which is always worth more because the products cost more.  

I would do it again. This place was definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect- I was in town for work and wanted something clean and light and it hit the spot. I wish ALL miso soups were like their tofu and seaweed soup. And the fresh roll was delish for dinner and breakfast  and not heavy on the vermicelli like many. Thanks Vegan I'll be back when I return to Phoenix.  I would like to try the eggplant next time but might have to stick with these two healthy items."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it was just goodish, nothing special. I was not expecting that it just a vegan Thai place.  I ordered the green curry with faux chicken ($9) and summer rolls. The Summer rolls (2 for $8) also had faux chicken and come with peanut and housin sauce, but not really enough sauce in my opinion. The lunch came with a soup which was extremely hot temperature wise and uneatable for 10 minutes. Once I did have it, was very bland. Just broth with a very small amount of veggies. The salad had a soy sauce sesame type dressing that was too sweet and salty for my taste. The green curry was best part of my meal, with lots of flavor and cooked just right. I was excited to see the brown rice thingy that comes with the meal but no flavor again, guess like any other rice. I had no drink and my total came out to $18.50."}
{"text":"Amazing curry! Tried the green and pumpkin peanut curries and both were amazingly delicious! I would come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"The reason this place is getting 4 stars is because the food was quite good. The service is horrid! I went in at lunch time and the place was really full, luckily i just needed a table for 1 and I sat down without anybody greeting me or giving me a menu. After 5 minutes of no service I walked to the front and asked for a menu and once again waited. After 15 minutes somebody finally took my order and I waited patiently for some water. No joke 35 minutes later (the restaurant was practically empty by then) me food AND water arrived. This place is great but if you don't have at least an hour to wait for food go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Many people think of vegan food as bland and boring. This place delivers tasty food without the meat. Loved the jungle noodles and yellow curry.  The spring rolls are also very good. We overwhelmed them on a convention day, and the one lady working there did an awesome job of keeping up. Super nice too. We ate her twice while in town. Def a must go for all vegans looking for some Thai food."}
{"text":"The soup here is AMAZING if you are doing a detox and looking for a great flavorful healthy meal! The owner is always very kind and nice. This is one of my favorite places to go. If you are not vegan such as myself you will love the variety and flavor of the food here. The customer service here is also great. The three stars are for the quality of the food that seems to have diminished. I am disappointed as this is a gem downtown but I will talk a break from here due to the food quality. My food was barely eaten this time around and I wish i would have went somewhere else for a salad."}
{"text":"Pretty ok. Like to go here to pretend I'm a cool in style vegan. I tell everyone in my vicinity that I am a vegan. Good food tho."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a vegan bite!  The food is great and they have a variety of dishes to choose from.  My wife (who's not vegan) easily found a dish for herself and she really enjoyed it.  To boot, the service is great and the prices are very reasonable.  All around great place!"}
{"text":"All the food is awesome, and the service is the best!! Coconut ice cream is amazing also, so don't leave without trying it!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant the food is so delicious and the restaurant is so clean. The staff is so wonderful. I am so glad I found a vegan Chinese food. It's my favorite restaurant in the downtown area"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have the best yellow curry I get it almost every time along with the Jungle noodles !! Lots of flavor ! Service is always great !!"}
{"text":"Food is great, the waiter was nice, and the vibe inside the restaurant is relaxing and vibrant. I had the Thai Iced tea and Pad Thai and was far from disappointed with my choice. My boyfriend had the curry. Both dishes were really good and filling."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. We go regularly because it is that amazing. Servers are super friendly. I don't think we've ever encountered an employee there that is rude. Great atmosphere and phenomenal vegan food!"}
{"text":"Love love love their food. Very peaceful atmosphere, great server, and great decor. 
-parking  gotta be paid. Just take the light rail and be adventurous."}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting, but I'll definitely be interested in returning! The Pumpkin Peanut Curry had amazing flavor. The restaurant was clean and pleasant, and the wait staff helpful."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy vegan dishes. Prompt and attentive staff. In the heart of downtown Phoenix. Walking distance from arena and Chase Field. Restaurant is clean and bright. Prices are good in relation to portions. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Have been excited to try this place ever since it was being constructed downtown. It was nice to see many different vegan choices on the menu. However, I would say the food choices were similar to that of Loving Hut but far less good. The part that ruined my experience were the many gnats flying all around us and our food. When the server asked why I didn't eat much I explained the bugs ruined my meal, and I didn't even get comped. If the situation would've been handled in the restaurant it could've prevented this review."}
{"text":"First time I haven't had to look at the food and see if i can modify it or charge or substitute anything since everything is vegan. For sure I'll return. Orange chicken was amazing as well as the thai coffee. My gfs meal was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Delicious......sooooo delicious. Love the peanut pumpkin curry and the pepper stir fry and the spaghetti (good for picky kids who don't want thai...but also for adults!). Really good peanut sauce.....peanut sauce goes on everything.... They have bananas in coconut milk which is one of our favorite desserts.

Everything is good here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and reasonable prices! 
So absolutely delicious and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Vegan House is the only 100% vegan restaurant within walking distance of most downtown events. The menu offers diverse options for those following a plant-based diet and people who just want to eat healthy food. I've been dining here since they opened, and am slowly making my way through the expansive menu. They are open for lunch and dinner every day, and lunch specials on weekdays. 

My favorite dish is the fresh ginger stir fry. I've had it with mock chicken and tofu, but want to try the mock beef next time I visit. Other items I've tried and liked: dumpling curry (which is listed on their online menu as \"dumping\" curry - fix that!), green curry, house fried rice, veggie rolls, pot stickers, praluck, onion and black pepper stir fry, jungle noodle and soy chicken wrap. All are great! I'm surprised that they don't have a red curry, given they are a Thai restaurant. Their online menu lists one of my Thai favorites - Tom Kha Kai (Thai coconut soup) but it's not on their printed menu so I haven't tried it yet but want to if it's available. The one item that everyone loves - orange soy chicken - is great, but it doesn't come with veggies so I get a bit bored just eating chicken chunks. They offer different levels of spice for stir fries and curries, but don't tend to over spice. Ordering \"medium\" gives you a hint of flavor, but is not overpoweringly spicy. The veggies are fresh and crispy. 

The main downside of Vegan House is that they don't staff appropriately. We were there on a Saturday night when there were several events happening downtown, a big vegetarian festival in Scottsdale that attracted vegan tourists, and a convention. They only had one waiter, who was literally running from table to table. We saw some people wait for awhile and leave without having been acknowledged, and I think I may have seen someone dodge their check because they were tired of waiting. We were served promptly and pleasantly (in part because we knew what we wanted and didn't ask questions like most tables around us did), but it was stressful watching him stress out! I'm glad to see so many people interested in dining there, but they can't sustain the business if they can't serve all their eager customers promptly!"}
{"text":"All around great place for lunch.  I had the fried rice lunch special with tofu.  Everything about it was great.  Rice, tofu, and small salad were all well-prepared.  The portion size was modest but filling.  The atmosphere is casual, comfortable, and clean.  The service was quick and the staff were friendly and kind.  A nice contrast to to all the hamburger/sports bars in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out during my lunch break.  It's a fairly small restaurant, maybe about 15 table tops.  I ordered the summer rolls (veggies & tofu) that came with a pretty tasty peanut sauce & hoisin and I tried their Jungle noodles with tofu & veggies, medium spicy.  For medium, it was pretty good spicy level.  But it was like Chinese Chow Fun...  I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu, if back in this area.  The servers were attentive & nice."}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout, and it was my first time trying this place. I ordered through Yelp, and got there at the specified time that my order would be ready. When I got there they hadn't seen my order but quickly made it and I was out the door in less than 10 minutes, so no issues there! 
I ordered the pad Thai with tofu, definitely tasty but I realized there was nowhere to specify the amount of heat I wanted on the order form. So there was little to no spice on mine, so make sure to add that in your comments section. 
Also tried the fried taro/ sweet potatoes and they were cooked perfectly and were all the delicious unhealthy fried goodness that I needed. The peanut sauce they came with was also very good and had a unique spice to it that I can't quit say what it was for sure. 
Can't wait to try more off the menu!"}
{"text":"We were going the symphony and were looking for a new place to try. The downtown ambassador gave us a list of restaurants and told us that she liked this place. Wow! The food is fantastic! The vegan shrimp is excellent. Their curries are to die for. We've been back several times and have tried a number of dishes and have yet to be disappointed.

As non-vegetarians, we often eat vegetarian, but rarely vegan. This place is as good as any we've been to in San Jose or Santa Cruz."}
{"text":"Tried the green curry lunch special that comes with rice, a salad, & soup for $9.00. The soup was basically chicken broth with a couple carrots and onion. The salad was fresh. The green curry was Outstanding! Nice portion & chunky!"}
{"text":"This is the only place that I've eaten at that is unique to Phoenix only, and I have to say it was outstanding. It isn't the typical healthy vegan food, it's definitely a vegan cheat meal. However the food didn't have me feeling super full and greasy. I got the pad Thai with soy chicken (a little weird, but very tasty soy chicken) and my wife got the orange chicken. The orange chicken was very good, I took a lot of that from my wife's plate. We got the fried banana and Cicinho ice cream for dessert which was incredible. They actually take whole pieces of banana and deep fry them (not the healthiest l, but really good). Again, overall it was really good, I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I should not blame the business for the delivery service they out source to another business. The food is really good and the service within is good as well, I'll order pick up & get it myself."}
{"text":"Late afternoon on a Saturday this place was pretty quiet. We were able to park right out front and were the only diners until the dinner crowd started to trickle in. Parking meter was $1.50/hr, limit two hours on weekends.

We ordered the Summer Rolls, which were fresh and tasty and came with two sauces, a sweet and tangy sauce and a frothy peanut sauce - both sauces were good. 

We also tried the FLT, a sandwich with fries. The fish reminded me of tofurkey if it were wrapped in seaweed and sliced. The sandwich was fresh and okay, but needed something like a tarter sauce. The Soy Chicken Wrap was also fresh and okay, but dry and could have used some vegan ranch dressing. Both sandwich and wrap had only a tiny bit of veganaise and were otherwise too dry. Extra sauce next time.

The Dumping [sic] Curry and Peanut Pumpkin Curry were both really good. I could have eaten a plate of the dumplings alone. Both came with what looked like black (forbidden) rice."}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn there was a vegan restaurant across the street from my work. 
I stopped in for a late lunch. They have a great lunch special that includes your choice of entree with soup and salad. The soup was very simple but tasty and comforting. The side salad also very simple but good. I had a yellow curry with veggie chicken and veggies, medium heat. It was soooo good. I planned on eating half and taking the rest with me for leftovers but I couldn't stop eating it. I had no self control. 
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Orange soy chicken! WOW the best vegan plate I've ever had, truly, honestly. Comes with rice, carrots and broccoli on the side. Sooooooo good. I always get their iced chai with boba mmmm! 

When it's super busy like late night or weekends the service can be very slow because it seems like every time I go they only have one guy running around as cashier and server. But besides that the service is friendly and food is always amazing.

I wish they had a location in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Awsome meal, tofu chicken is delicious,  with the ginger sauce.
As per their soup.and the red rice. 
And their FBI, fried bananas is awsome 

Very nice waitress,
And peaceful room, relaxing"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food and ambiance here! I ordered the Grand Tempura and Jungle Noodle with tofu and didn't regret it! The tempura was delicious, especially the mock chicken that melts in your mouth. My girlfriend and I sincerely look forward to trying out the entire menu over the coming months.

If you love great vegan food, this is your haven."}
{"text":"This is a veggie delight. They have many different veggie proteins. I got the jungle noodles with soy chicken. 

Medium spice. 

Perfect. This is a must for a vegetarian. Pleasant casual surroundings and wonderful food. 

The serving size was also perfect. 

The cook made it exactly medium heat the different tastes were amazing.  

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So, my flight into Phoenix tonight involved an emergency abandonment of the landing by our capable pilot. A little shaken, I got to my hotel and decided to grab a kiltlifter beer and order vegan takeout. Yeah, I am a little messed up right now. 

Surprisingly, I am enjoying dinner. The vegetable gyoza were crispy and delicious, coming with a spicy dipping sauce. The edamame were fine, slightly over cooked for my liking but well salted. Yellow curry was my main course. Solid dish with some complexity of flavor I enjoyed. Fried rice seemed small for the price. It was the least favorite component of the meal. Dessert was the classic Thai dish of fresh mango on purple rice with a cream to bring the two together. Awesome. 

Overall, not sure I would order this for my last meal but I certainly enjoyed it as my next meal!"}
{"text":"Yummy yum! Get the... everything! This place is incredible:)
Also, my daughter loves it, she's been coming here since she discovered spring rolls at 10 months old!
Wish they had a larger delivery area!"}
{"text":"If you're vegan and desperately looking for a decent vegan experience in downtown Phoenix, Vegan House will scratch that itch!  I stopped here last week for a quick vegan lunch, and wish I lived nearer so I could go more often. I ordered the vegan seafood curry which came with a cup of soup. It was tasty. 
Very reasonable priced, near the light rail and the staff was friendly too. 

NEAREST LIGHT RAIL STOP:  Central Ave & Washington"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan place... ordered pot stickers dumplings, pad Thai noodles n green curry.All of the dishes were delicious n yummy. Very quick service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meals during my recent trip to a conference in downtown Phoenix.   The food was flavorful yet did not over load it with excessive oil, sugar or salt.   Had the Buddha Plate one time and a large salad another time.  Many dishes have tofu or other soy based protein options.    You can select the spice level when ordering.  Very calm ambiance with lots of light from the south facing windows.   Very relaxing environment.   I see some complain of 'slow' service or bland food - if you want a fast food grease pit don't come here but if you are looking for vegan food meal in a harmonious environment this is your destination."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite vegan spots. The staff is so friendly and so polite. I normally order the Jungle Noodle lunch special as I work right around the corner! They are absolutely to die for! I can't wait to explore the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"eh,  Not too great.

The service is was really good!  the food just wasn't there.  It was very meh.
I mean it looked good, but it tasted sad :(

It's in downtown phoenix, so walking is the best way to reach this place."}
{"text":"I ordered green curry with tofu and veggies to go. Spicy level hot. It was spicy but not too much. I was a bit worried about ordering hot but it was good for me. The rice texture seemed a bit off but mixed w the curry i soon wasnt bothered by it too much. This meal was pretty good. 
I would definitely come back. Nice to see a vegan focused restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!! Being a vegan, there are limits to where I can go eat, I walked into this wonderful little place and was so happy that I could EAT EVERYTHING on the menu. So tasty, service was on point! Love this place, will be back tomorrow to try more.."}
{"text":"We've found another great restaurant by forgetting that Green is closed on Sundays. 

While passing through Phoenix on a Sunday evening, we were struggling to find a vegan restaurant moderately close to the freeway that was open. I'm really glad that we landed on this place.

Vegan House is relatively new and I hope it does well as the food was flavorful, the service was friendly and attentive, and, as vegans, it's always a joy to be able to eat anything on the menu.

I would say that maybe there are a few too many choices on that menu, as it contains, in addition to Thai standards, a number of other disparate cuisines. Not many restaurants can pull off both curry and spaghetti. 

I got the Pumpkin Peanut Curry (PPC) with tofu. It was everything I love in one bowl. The tofu had a nice crispiness to it and contrasted nicely with the soft pumpkin. The sauce was rich and had the perfect level of spiciness (I got medium. I could probably have even gone a little higher.) My companion, looking for something less rich, went with the soy chicken wrap, which, though simple, was refreshing. The fries weren't perfect--a bit soft and salty--but as I mentioned earlier, we didn't expect that to be entirely within their wheelhouse. 

Overall though, a positive experience. Vegan House, we are so glad to have found you and wish you all the best."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such rave reviews.  It's pretty mediocre in my book.  I love having another vegan place in Phoenix, but this is definitely not close to one of my top vegan restaurants in Phoenix.  The food is edible, but nothing noteworthy and feels overpriced for what you receive.  The service is not the best and my order was messed up the last time that I dined in.  I eat here when I'm nearby and other places aren't open, but it's a bit overpriced and not as amazing as everyone seems to say.  I would much rather frequent Loving Hut or another similar vegan place."}
{"text":"Pretty good all-vegan Thai food. Tasty, inexpensive, and friendly staff. The summer rolls were really tasty, as was the soy chicken Pad Thai."}
{"text":"If there is any business that I would have wanted to replace My Mom's Thai Kitchen, it's this restaurant - Vegan House.

The decor is brand new and looks great.  Earthly colors all over.  These ain't yo mama's fast food gotta-eat-meat colors.  You can free your mind (and your ass will follow) while you sit and wait for food. You may just break out the aromatherapy and start a meditation chant while your Qi comes in equilibrium with the cosmos.

Currently the hours are everyday from 11 AM to 9 PM so I hope the downtown crowd makes use of their hospitality.  Lunch Specials are M-F 11PM-3PM.  They have togo menus too and deliver within a mile radius.

The extensive menu includes appetizers, soup, salads, tempura,  noodles, rice, sandwiches, wraps, and desserts.  And although most of the meals are typical, they are delicious vegan and vegetarian Thai / american.   

Cooked up and served by a staff that cares about their clients' allergies.  \"Was I allergic to soy or peanuts\" they asked me.  When was the last time that happened at a restaurant?

And now for the food:

1. MC salad.  What a surprise!  Flavor exploded in my mouth.  It's mostly mango and carrot with sauteed onion and peanuts on top of romaine lettuce.  I think they used some carrot dressing too.  Sweet and tangy to taste.  Worth it!

2. Green Curry.  Creamy coconut milk with veggies.  Love it!  I could probably drink the coconut milk by itself.

3. Eggplant.  Delicious, but a little on the oily side.  

All were flavorful.  Not salty

Thumbs up to Vegan House.  Vegan in da house!  Woop woop woop!"}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the lunch portion of Buddha's Delight. It was admittedly tasty. I love that this place is vegan but I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to fill up on greasy noodles, rice and vegetables. The service was good and the people who worked there were very nice and polite. I'll have to go back and try something different. I was not happy with what I ordered."}
{"text":"The orange tofu chicken was super good. Surprisingly filling. When we walked in we were greeted and seated by a super cute little kid, who I assume is the owners son. His catering alone made the experience great"}
{"text":"Vegan House was a pleasant surprise during my stay in downtown Phoenix. It was thankfully located very close to my hotel and is pretty much right in the heart of the city. Once I walked in I was greeted warmly and quickly shown to my table, offered a menu and some water and time to review my choices. 

I'm a sucker for Orange \"Chicken\" as it's probably the only thing I've ever missed since becoming vegetarian. So when I see it on the menu I have to try it, and I did here as well. You can choose your spice level and I ordered mine hot. I like spice. Bring on the spice, make me sweat a bit if you have to, but for all means I want to taste the spice. Sadly this is where the one star was removed as it was not nearly as spicy as I wanted. It was more like the PG-13 of spice levels, it gives you a hint of what's going on without the full blown impact. 

The side salad I ordered was tasty and artistically presented. It was a bit larger than I would have expected. Then came out the orange \"chicken\". The consistency was good, not too dense but not too soft. A notion of crunch on the outside and a decent amount of sauce. Accompanying the dish was some brown rice and some steamed broccoli and a few carrot stars. These were delicious and complemented the dish quite well. Again my only complaint was the lack of spice. However I'll know better next time to order it blazing hot.

The menu is quite extensive with very creative sounding faux meat dishes. I'm looking forward to trying more when I return if I'm in town again. The prices are reasonable, the service is prompt and efficient. I'm pleased to have dined here and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I feel bad. I don't think I've ever written a bad review for a restaurant, especially for a vegan place, but our experience was just... terrible. My partner and I love visiting Phoenix for the excellent vegan food, but this left A LOT to be desired. Maybe we just got unlucky, but our meal was gross. We shared the tempura, which was, as expected, totally fine (because it was DEEP FRIED!). My partner ordered the pad thai with \"shrimp\" and I had the sea food soup. Both were not right. I will eat almost anything, and I couldn't stomach more than a few bites of my soup. It was gross. My partner's pad thai was not great, either; although, the noodles made it more tolerable. Service was fine, but we weren't brought drinks until we were almost done with our appetizer (and had to remind the service more than once that we were thirsty.) It wasn't busy.  There were two or three other tables at the time. I think we either got incredibly unlucky and both ordered the worst two things on the menu, or this place just isn't that good. I'm not willing to give it a second chance--there are many other wonderful places in Phoenix to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great Pad Thai with soy chicken. If you're into vegan/vegetarian, you must eat here!"}
{"text":"I made my brother take me here for my birthday. He's not a vegan or vegetarian, but he described the food as \"amazing.\" We got the veggie rolls with plum sauce as an appetizer, which we both liked. My brother got the yellow curry, and I got the orange chicken--well, mock chicken. We ate every bite of everything we ordered, and though I had planned to try dessert for my birthday, we were too full to eat anything more. The orange mock chicken could easily fool someone who was expecting actual chicken. And my brother says he will return here on his own, even though he's not vegan.  I would highly recommend the food here to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch! Always looking for an opportunity to check out a different lunch spot. Food was good. Service was sub par. The waitress didn't take the time to even discuss or go over menu I was under the impression that some of the food was not vegan she rushed off and said I'll be back. We were one of the two tables in the place, I just felt like I had annoyed her more than anything. Ended up getting a dish with soy chicken and I thought it was good, just as spicey as I had asked for! The soap was a few pieces of carrots and watered down broth, no my favorite! I may or may not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered the Pad Thai and Orange chicken it was excellent. I'm so glad we found this little gem in downtown."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Spring rolls, salsa, noodles! My mom and I loved it! Our server was excellent. The atmosphere is clean, contemporary and friendly. We are getting food to go for another meal. Lots of options!! We are so lucky to have this place here in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant I've been to.  The yellow curry with chicken was the best yellow curry I've ever had.  The fried rice with chicken was flavorful and hearty.  I also tasted the Buddha Delight with shrimp which was amazing!   You've gotta come here whether you are vegan or not because this food is delicious!"}
{"text":"No matter what you get here, I can't imagine you not being satisfied. (Double negatives in a sentence = a positive.) 

This was truly a positive experience. It can be difficult and sometimes near impossible finding vegan options (aside from the consiliatory veggie patty) in many conventional restaurants. Not here at the VEGAN HOUSE. Everyone in our party loved their entree and the vegan options were plentiful. 

But whatever you do, SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT and get the coconut ice-cream! No really, get the coconut ice-cream. And you'll want more than just one scoop. Just saying."}
{"text":"It's always so nice to have a vegan place to default to! I've been to Vegan House a handful of times and I absolutely love it! This time around we had the yellow curry and the peanut sauce noodle. Both were so gooooood! The curry is always gives me a \"homey\" feeling that I can't quite explain. Just like a good comfort food whenever you might be having a shitty day...or a happy day...The peanut noodle was also really yummy. I find that peanut sauce noodles often clump together, therefore taking away from the experience. Their noodles didn't stick together all that much, thank goodness!

There's a huge list of things that I really want to try on their menu. A lot of alternative/faux meats to choose from if you enjoy that kind of veganism...a lot of vegetable/tofu dishes as well.

Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan eater,  but this place has fresh ingredients and the taste omg. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I think you can tell by the pictures they did not disappoint. They even used what looked and tasted like black rice. Good flavor and portions by my standards. As I walked out I ask some folks about being regulars and they mention it was their second time. My reply was that it must have been good the first time to bring them back for seconds. They concurred. 

I'm thinking there may be days when I drive 20 min and pay for parking downtown to enjoy more of what's served up at The Vegan House."}
{"text":"Oh man, you know what I loved about Vegan house? The fact that it's been about 2 weeks since I was there and I smile just thinking about how insanely delicious the food was. Can't wait to go back! Yes, love starting a review like this. First off, I had their \"chicken yellow curry\" and man it was one of THE BEST curries I've ever had. It had the perfect amount of veggies, vegan chicken strips and rice that came with it. I went for lunch so it came with a small salad and soup which was delicious as well. My gf had their pad thai which is not at all like a traditional pad thai (with peanut sauce)  she said it was more of a tamarind base. We also started with an appetizer of fried sweet potato and Taro (absolutely dee-lish). Service was perfect, visited during the week for lunch. Can't wait to go back. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean the music is wonderful ambience great. We had mock chicken wraps ried bananas and coconut ice cream eggplant soup and vegan fish it was really good I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good food here! But I have to say that I saw employee leave the restroom without washing her hands. Say disappointed by this."}
{"text":"First time here.  Place is very convenient to my work.  Pad thai is amazing!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great vegan options and super service. The staff is friendly and attentive. Have had several different dishes there and all were fantastic. I love that only brown rice is served with their dishes; no white rice here! Highly recommended for vegans and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"Food was excellent enjoyed the lunch special buddah delight. Staff were super friendly and the atmosphere was peaceful."}
{"text":"Green curry dumplings and spring rolls were exceptional. I'm not vegan, but this was still a hearty meal. 

I was told that all the meat substitutes are wheat-free, too. (Four hours later, my stomach still concurs.)"}
{"text":"Real food you can trust.  I recommend the Budda's Feast:  a ton of delicious veggies in sauce (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, onion, etc) with red/brown rice, and a salad."}
{"text":"The soup with veggies and tofu didn't have broth: it was just hot water. The jungle noodles were not bad, heavy on the protein and light on vegetables. The spring rolls were pretty good, with a slightly spicy sweet sauce. Good atmosphere, clean, nice restrooms, and good service. We might be back, but maybe not because the food was just so-so."}
{"text":"I was in town from Las Vegas and decided to try this place since it was close to my hotel. I had fish of three flavors, pad Thai and the summer rolls. Everything was absolutely excellent. I wish there was something that high quality back in Vegas. I can't wait to get back to Phoenix to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Incredible flavor! Clean restaurant, extremely polite waitress, neat eating experience!! I had pumpkin, rice, and vegan fish (made from soy and seaweed)-- most excellent!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good vegan restaurant in phoenix. I was glad I found this restaurant! The staff are very nice and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great employees! Very friendly environment. I ate with my family there and we enjoyed it. It's fun to be in downtown for lunch or dinner. The Green Curry is amazing!! Be aware that meter is $1.50 per hour. Support your local vegan and vegetarian restaurants!"}
{"text":"The Jungle Noodle dish was excellent! Great portion size and the flavors were good. I almost didn't have enough left to take the photo! I had my dish with the tofu. The restaurant is a nice restaurant and clean as well. There was only one waitress so there was an extended wait period. Other than that, food was great!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!  Flavors are on point.  Friendly staff.  Your Non vegan friends will love this place."}
{"text":"This place is only vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurant. We certainly were glad to find it near the Phoenix airport. The menu offers a very diverse options for non-meat eaters. 
We ordered house fried rice and Buddha's delight. Personally, I've had better vegan food since I live in Chicago. But I guess for Phoenix, it was as good as it gets.
I'd recommend 1 visit at least per visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awful service!!! I didn't like a dish and the lady refused to take it off of the bill. She said it cost them money so if you order something it doesn't matter whether you like it or not. You have to pay for it regardless. What a load of BS! We were at first very impressed. But the guest service is so bad, we want to make sure nobody goes here and gives your business to them!!! I would like to give them 0 stars but not possible"}
{"text":"I was excited to find somewhere to get a good vegan lunch while I was in Phoenix for a day. 
The service was great and the food was good. It wasn't a \"knock your socks off\" vegan meal, as I was expecting for a place that specializes in vegan food. Nothing wrong with it, but I would probably look around for other vegan options before returning."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food.  A real find.  Try the Goodish Feast and fried bananas and home made ice cream."}
{"text":"Can I just say MMMMMMAZING? Well I just did, you couldn't stop me. Getting to the point, this place is amazing! Great vegan food and they give you large servings! I always take home leftovers. The service has been awesome every time I have come in, the staff being kind and loving to joke around with me and my family. They also do a good job on spice (and I LOVE spicy food.) 

Now some of you might not be so into vegan cuisine, which is perfectly fine, but I will tell you that I have taken plenty of meat eaters here and they have loved it. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting some yummy Thai! 

Also.... THERE IS SOUP YOU CAN EAT HERE AS A VEGAN! Whew... It's just so rare that it deserved all caps."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch during the work week and have ordered carry-out both times.  

The Yellow Curry with Soy Chicken, which came with rice, was very flavorful and had exactly the right amount of spice for a curry dish.  The portion was good and they were not skimpy with the vegan chicken. It was a very filling dish and I had enough for 2 days. 

On the second visit, I ordered the Grand Tempura.  This dish is an appetizer, but was large enough to be a meal for me. It came with tempura battered vegan chicken, vegan shrimp, and assorted vegetables. I spotted broccoli, red bell peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes amongst my veggie variety.   The tempura dish came with a delicious sweet chili dipping sauce.  The problem is that they only give you one sauce, all of which you'll sop up 1/2 way through this dish.  An extra sauce is $2. TWO dollars for a 0.25-0.50 cent cup of sauce.  Outrageous. The dish should come with 2 sauces already, based on its size.  

I don't like feeling that I've been over-charged, so this issue has kept me away for almost a year.  Being that the food was good, I plan to give them another try, one day. 4 1/2-star food, 2 1/2 stars for petty larceny."}
{"text":"I was observing Fast of Nineveh. First time here and I called in my order for pick up, no issues. Food was delicious, best vegan food I've had yet. Clean restaurant and friendly staff.

Will be coming back and I recommend everyone to try it."}
{"text":"Had the spicy spaghetti seafood plate. It was delicious and flavorful. I will definitely return here. Much recommended if you like vegan food."}
{"text":"Great Asian vegan food! I'm from California and am a vegetarian and can say the flavors were definitely there for me. My partner and I ordered the veggie spring rolls, Vermicelli veggie soup, and the veggie dumpling curry. One of the best curries I've ever had! Great service also. Even if you're not into vegan food it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Good service. V good food. We ordered green curry and fresh ginger vegan seafood. Food smelt and tasted  v good.  The servers can smile a bit though."}
{"text":"This place was quite the surprise. I was so impressed   I can't wait to go back. I had the Yellow Curry and was amazed. It was wonderful, just the perfect amount of heat and sweet. Would not have known it was all vegetarian had I not been in a vegetarian restaurant. The dish was super amazing. Let's not forget the homemade ice cream, accompanied with fried bananas finished with a strawberry sauce."}
{"text":"2nd time here but 1st time on a weekend day. I ordered the Spaghetti Basil entree and it was yummy! Lots of good flavors and was cooked fresh. I'm not even Vegan and was impressed by the food.

The only caveat was the restaurant only had one server for the entire restaurant which was packed. He took both to go & sit down orders, brought waters & drinks, bussed the tables, and brought our checks. He was literally running around the entire time. I felt so bad for him. Because of this, the wait was long to order, at least 15 mins before he had an opportunity to come take our order. Food came out in a decent amount of time. Probably won't return for the weekend or when I'm really hungry. They need to get the guy some help. He was really nice."}
{"text":"Clean quiet and inviting. Vegan options galour! I'm getting the dumpling curry medium. Will let you know what it's like. I got it to go."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Many vegan choices on the menu. The noodle bowls are all good. Open 'til 9pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant EVER!  Great prices, and amazing tasting food.  The tofu green curry is my favorite.  Hefty portions, great lunch specials, and quick service.  Last time I order online and it was ready and waiting right when I got there.  The soy chicken is also killer.  I drive across town just to eat here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good and filling, but nothing that made say ooh I really loved that and I want to come here again!  The taro appetizer was nice, but I've had better fried taro  at other restaurants.  The dipping sauces were a little lacking in flavor for me.  From what I can remember, the dipping sauces were sweet and I would have preferred a savory/salty dipping sauce.

The curry with dumplings was an interesting concept.  I ended up not really liking the dumplings that much.  They were filled with some kind of mixture that I can only describe as reminiscent of tabouleh (I don't like tabouleh).  But if you are a fan, definitely go for that dish!  Again, the curry sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes.  It did have a nice spicy kick which I enjoyed.  The black/purple rice is a nice touch that makes this dish stand out from other curries you might have tried before!

I was worried about slow service, because I was heading to the opera afterwards and other reviewers said it took forever to get their food.  However, our food came out pretty quickly and we were able to eat appetizer and dinner and pay our check in less than 45 min!  I will probably eat here again, because it's healthy food that's conveniently located in downtown.  However, I'm not running back there for seconds just yet."}
{"text":"YES! I finally found really good curry!! I've been looking relentlessly all over Phoenix, and now I have found a gem. The restaurant was clean, customer service excellent, and it only took @ 6 minutes to get my order to go. I got home and everything was packed perfectly. I ordered the curry special, and it really was special. If you order your curry \"hot\"  have no doubt it will be. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu. I would highly recommend this restaurant to both vegan and non vegan friends. Winner winner vegan chicken dinner!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken wrap (which was slightly misleading, as it was listed as a sandwich.)
It was very good - I'm craving some now!
The restaurant was cute and clean; however, it was incredibly hot as well.
The restaurant was full while we ate, and was only served by one person. If you're looking for quick service (due to a time crunch from a conference) this certainly isn't your best best, but the food IS amazing!"}
{"text":"Has gluten free options too. The rice that they serve with curries is a mix of brown and purple. Not white rice."}
{"text":"Tak was a lovely server and the whole vegan menu looked delicious. The food was great but \"Thai spicy\" is no joke. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I couldn't love this place more!!!!! I just stumbled upon it. Healthy, DELICIOUS, and fast food. Outstanding service and a very relaxing atmosphere. I even loved the music they were playing, it felt like a spa deep within the jungle. 

My water came with lemon exactly how I like it. 

I went during lunch and ordered the yellow curry lunch special with fake chicken and I added broccoli. YUM!!!! Truly outstanding!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am impressed. I was going vegan for awhile so I stopped in to grab lunch. I was amazed at how good the cheese was on my vegan chicken sandwich. OMG. Maybe it's because I was starving or because it was my first time eating vegan cheese but, it blew my taste buds away! The lady was super nice and there were so many options on the menu. Place was a little busy but that was ok because the pricing is great! I love this spot- even though I did not make as a full-fledged vegan! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered vegetable green curry and the potato and taro appetizer.  It was awesome and enough for two meals.  Staff were great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the yellow curry and it was great, I'm not a big fan of soy meats but that is just my preference. The order and delivery was super quick and every thing was prepared right. A great place for vegans, vegetarians or even someone like me who eats meat!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! My fiancé and i are here from out of town for a health convention and this place is walking distance from our hotel. We loved it so much the first time that we came back for a second round the next day! Their menu is extensive with all sorts of delicious meat alternatives! I wish this restaurant was closer to home, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"It's true that I'm not a vegan. Can't even call myself a vegetarian. But I love food. And because of that, I can appreciate the new kid on the block (girl you know it's true...oh wait, that's Milli Vanilli) which is why I was excited Vegan House is finally opened. 

It's not often that I take lunch outside the office. So, today was a treat. And that treat started with a lovely cup of soup. It should be said, I'm not really a soup lover. The idea of occupying so much stomach space to what's nothing more than flavored water seems like a dining mistake. But this soup was good! The veggie roll appetizers were terrific. Crispy and flavorful, they really were a great pre-entrée option. My Jungle Noodles were a great blend of fresh veggies and dense tofu. It was all the right stuff, baby. On that note, I asked if the tofu had been smoked because the texture was more meaty, with a firm exterior with just the right amount of bite. Turns out, they quickly fry it; amazing! I'd ordered mild and it was far too mild for my tastes. Next time, I'll be certain to get it hotter. Or maybe next time I'll try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"Good food but the presentation was mediocre ... both in terms of the food and the restaurant. The pot stickers weren't anything special - \"pretty good\" said my daughter but we were looking for exceptional."}
{"text":"Real tasty dish. Would have been nice to sit and eat. Server said I could order to go only after sizng me up.   Green curry was memorable. Lots of fresh veggies and heat level just right."}
