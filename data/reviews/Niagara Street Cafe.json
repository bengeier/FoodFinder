{"text":"Wow, had a completely amazing meal here. They keep things simple, and the ingredients really shine here. It's not a big joint, and it's tucked away from the bustle of the city. Even though it's a bit out of the way, you can get here on public transportation, and it's well worth it. I would probably call it American bistro, at the risk of offending the Canadians. Otherwise I wouldn't say it's really a particular cuisine, just damn good food. 

It's a small enough place that you'd have tough time with a large group. The ideal size is 4-top, 6 in a pinch."}
{"text":"This really is A1 all round. Beyond fantastic wines, menu, ingredients, ambiance and service.   When we want to eat well, eat right and eat memorably we eat here.  We also were engaged in this restaurant so yes, it's romantic in a warm neighborly way. Urban class all the way and hip too."}
{"text":"It's my birthday... I'm pregnant and really craving a good French meal.  We live right round' the corner from Niagara Street Cafe, read some good reviews and went...

To begin, I KNOW French food. I'm not talking out of my dimply arse here. I lived in Montreal for 7 years where you can get great French food at a reasonable price (and bring your own wine) and I've spent a lot of time in France indulging for months at a time so I actually know what I'm talking about. I know what GOOD French food tastes like and I have yet to have it in Toronto. Yet, I have had far better pretender French food than this in Toronto for half the price.

It was really bad! I have to say... just bad! I don't know what's up with the reviews of this place but for the price point it's just a rip off!

I'd rather spend half the money at La Palette which is also not great but at least it's not charging you double for the same pretender French food. 

In brief, if you want to go to a very quaint, small, cozy space and eat bad French food for an exorbitant amount of money this place is for you. If you actually want really good French food - go to Montreal or Quebec city for the weekend."}
{"text":"L.O.V.E. this place.

The service, the ambiance, the food, the chef, the candles, the wine...there is absolutely nothing negative that I have to say about this restaurant. Whether I've been here with a few girlfriends or with my husband, it's been a beautiful experience.

The prices are totally reasonable, ESPECIALLY considering the quality of food you're getting. The menu changes fairly regularly which keeps things interesting. A very welcome change from the pub-fare that's so prevalent in the King West/Liberty Village area.

If you really want to be adventurous - have the server suggest your meal and a wine pairing to go with it - they are extremely knowledgeable and share this with their clients."}
{"text":"Now.. I wrote a review that was an honest reflection of our experience at Niagara Street Cafe and it was removed. So I am re posting it and have asked the rest of the dinner party , who all agree with the poor food, to comment or write their own review. If Yelp is to do a service to the Community and help restaurants lean then they cant be biased and all reviews need to be posted.  My original review is below. 
John N.

I would rate this lower than 1 Star if i could. It had to be the worst meal we  have ever had in Toronto. Perhaps it was the night?  We were a party of 7 and arrived at 630 for dinner. 

Atmosphere... Fine.. small noisy rooms but candles made it alive. Music came on when we were almost done.

Appetizer... I had Smelt served with 2 dipping sauces. The smelt was battered and deep fried. Sauces were bland. Thai dipping sauce tasted like M&M bottled stuff.  Tasteless, greasy did not finish it. Presentation. A pile of deep fried onion ring looking things with 2 little dipping bowls on the plate. No eye candy here.

Mains... Lamb. Now this was the worst Lamb ever. A bowl of stuff. Lamb Shoulder , much fat and tough bits on a bed of something swimming in some kind of tasteless cream and lamb juice swamp. Presentation..very unappealing to the eye. White bowl, a spooned out concoction with no colour and as bland to the optics as it was on the palate. Ate half of it. Hated the rest of it. Served lukewarm at best with one of us sending it back because it was cold.

Deep fried Duck Leg was breaded and the waitress said the breading was to die for. Well it almost killed us. Again a tasteless bit of meat with unappealing visuals.

Pastrami was smoked far to much and was like eating an old shoe left in the smoker long after Grandpa passed on. Hey look what we found!! Pastrami... It was bloody awful.

Side.... Mac and cheese that was supposed to be a bit spicy. Flavourless dish with pasta topped by bacon bits and caramelized onions in it. No cheese flavour at all. Others tasted it and said YUK.

Now this was the first restaurant that we have been to as a group that NO ONE commented how good the food was and everyone said it was a no repeat ever. we dine individually and as a group often and frequent good restaurants.  Sad to say the Niagara Street Cafe is an awful spot where only the service and the nice wines cant make up for bland tasteless food that seems to go through the deep fryer and arrive awash in greasy tasteless portions. If you want fried food order KFC. It is better.

By the way... I forgot to mention they had Toronto Life in that night for a photo shoot. A few model looking types may have been hired to drink tinis and look good in photos. Pictures were taken at their tables where the food was 3 dimensionally presented and looked decent... Steak and fish though.   So a staged event?  You decide.

Cheers..

{"text":"Great restaurant with excellent ambiance. Charming service and food focused on local, seasonal produce."}
{"text":"Niagara Street Cafe is a great little place. Super friendly and delicious food. The brunch is awesome, and it's a neat little quiet spot for dinner. Very cozy. The staff are really nice and seem to be into the food too. Not pretentious which suits me fine! Yum."}
{"text":"Small, intimate and creative American Bistro.

Took my daughter for a night out to enjoy a good meal and conversation.  Staff complements the warm entry with genuine smiles and consideration. Lack of pretension and attitude was appreciated!

Seating was immediate, welcome friendly and menu uncluttered.

Sufficient variety and complexity to each dish.  Interesting mix of tastes, textures and styles. 

I started with asparagus soup with pickled radish.  Interesting broth, not  cream-based which highlighted the subtle asparagus flavor. Had to ask the chef for more detail.

My daughter enjoyed the lamb shoulder while I had the special suckling pig. Pork was tender, proportions were good but a little bland. Small portion of crackling helped but didn't put it over the top. Safe.

Great recommendation on a Pinot Noir to complement both the lamb and pig. 

Dessert was an interesting mix of sweet and contrasting heat. I had a coconut tapioca with Thai chile. Loved it!

Satisfying evening, interesting creations, flavors perhaps a bit too subtle. Has tremendous potential and could be amazing... But left me a little short.  Enough there to give it another chance in the near future though."}
{"text":"So my partner in crime in eating Vancouver last year moved back to Toronto and swears by the 45 day dry aged striploin at Niagara Street Cafe and after what seems like eternity, I landed in Toronto and headed straight to Niagara Street Cafe!

What a cute place, tucked away on a small street.  I could see it being a great date place - felt very comfortable there with our amazingly nice, charismatic, attentive (did I mention HANDSOME) waiter.  

While waiting for our dry aged steak, we were given mini portions of a bouillabaisse soup - which was a nice touch to the cold weather outside.  And not too long afterwards, a long plate of thin cut striploin arrived in front of us!  It's $30/person for these slices of heaven.  Literally, that was the most memorable slices of steak I've ever had.  I'd say its almost like a beef carpaccio - a little thicker and packs so much more flavour.  I now swear by this 45 day dry aged striploin :)

The dessert we tried was their own marshmellow made with bacon on a graham cracker.  None of us were impressed by this but maybe we just picked the wrong dessert.  They always have 3 desserts made in house that changes all the time.

Anyway the menu I've been told changes really often and sometimes they run out of the steak.  I'd definitely come back again for the steak...and actually their entire menu looks really good too!

This might possibly be my new favourite restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Beginning to end great evening, attentive smart service and intimate setting. Great for couples and food lovers. Try the confit of Ox tongue. Never had something like this!"}
{"text":"I was here recently for a friend's birthday party and I can't stop raving about it.

Anton and all of our hosts were remarkably friendly and especially knowledgable about all that they served. A rare trait indeed.

I started with some simply amazing Caraquet oysters, a mini taco with chorizo and pecorino followed by the 60 day dry aged striploin with an arugula salad and a variety of sides provided by the host including a homemade kimchi and the most incredible Mac 'N Cheese I have ever had in my life. It is a must-order item here folks.

Chef Nick Liu is one talented cat. There was nothing but all-around compliments from my entire table. Some highlights were (as stated by my dinnermates) the incredibly crispy Muscovy Duck Confit, the panko-crusted Oxtail, and of course, the striploin and Mac 'N Cheese.

I can't wait to go back. Good thing I have reservations for this Thursday!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I wanted to like Niagara Street Cafe, I really did! I brought my dad here who was in town from down south. I choose NSC since I had read such nice reviews of it. 

We were seated without a reservation on a Wednesday night. That was nice. We had a window seat, which did not afford an attractive view, but more concerning was how COLD it was. Even with candles and food and wine I spent much of the meal feeling chilly despite my cardigan.

We started off with the calamari taco. It was delicious, but it was a really small portion. Two small tacos, and each one was only 2 small bites. Delicious bites though!

We ordered the 60 day age steak for three people. At $37 each it was the most pricey thing on the menu, but not overwhelmingly so. I have to admit, I was disappointed in it. It was salty, and cold when it arrived at the table. It was very tender, on the plus side, but it sort of felt like a steak salad. A handful of arugula with some sliced steak, with a sprinkle of Parmesan on top. No sides. I surely expected more.

Their dessert was really nice. I ordered the brownie with caramel sauce and bacon brittle. It was deep and rich and delicious.

It's wasn't a horrible meal by any account, but I did find it lacking, which was disappointing. The service was adequate, but I wasn't blown away.

$230 for 3 glasses of wine, one appetizer, the shared main courses, and 3 desserts."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday last week, and it was one of the best meals I'd ever had.

We'd ordered an appetizer, some kind of crab-lobster-mushroom thing, and it was absolutely horrible.    It was cold and uninteresting, very similar to my last girlfriend.

\"Well, that's a star off for sure...\" she said.  I agreed.

Overall, I liked the ambiance, the service and even the $45 Rioja (one of the cheaper wines on the menu).

So what could possibly turn a 4 star experience into a 5?

If your answer was \"The 45-day aged ribeye steak.\", then you'd be correct.  Seriously, you MUST order this freaking thing before you die.  While it MIGHT kill you, it's certainly worth the risk.  This is one of the best pieces of beef I've ever had."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a romantic, non-pretentious, fine dining restaurant, this is the place. The food was good, but portions could have been better - but I would definitely come here for the ambiance. 

I love places with great service, and has a little bit of character. This small house, and it seems like it used to be, on Niagara street, just exudes coziness when you walk in. The ceilings are low, the place is small, but it doesn't feel crowded. They left enough space in the 'waiting' area to make sure of that. 

The place is dim, and lit by candles and dimmed potlights above.  We were seated by the window, and it was really romantic. 

The staff was really friendly, and offered suggestions as we were deciding. I like waiters that I can talk to at the same level as me. 

The wine list is extensive, but only a few were available by the glass ($12). We got the Malbec - sweet, with dryness near the end. 

The menu changes seasonally, so don't be surprised if the menu online doesn't match.  The menu seems to be a fusion of Asian flavours with Canadian flavours, but not so much that you would call it a Fusion place - nor trying too hard to incorporate 'exotic' ingredients. 

Warm bread to start with olive oil and caramelized onions to dip. 

Was a little disappointed with how long it took to get our food out (30 mins) but once it got started, the flow was better. 

We got the Oysters Rockafeller ($12) to start, which I thought would be baked.  She did say there would be only 3 or 4 pieces, but when we got them, there were only 2 and they were not in the shell. It was covered in an amazing cream sauce, but I was still reminded that each bite was $2 each. I hate that feeling. 

For mains, I got the Lamb shoulder with Gnocchi (only 5 large peices, and some sprinkle of Kale - I don' t know where the goat cheese is). Tender, but expected more flavour.
The Beef Brisket was also very good, that was served on top of a potato mustard puree - if you like mustard you would love it. 

For dessert, there were 3 choices, repeated over and over by the waiter to other tables.  Soma Dark Chocolate samosa, blood orange tart deconstructed (oranges, tart and custard on the side), and one more that I have now forgotten, which means that it probably wasn't interesting enough to be on my radar. 

We got the Samosa - it was good, but I'm not a fan of Cardamom, and it was covered in it. 

Overall, the meal was about $65 a person, including wine. 

There is free parking along the street north of Niagara. 

I would come here again, but not in a long while. It's on my list, and would recommend to people for sure. 

Came here on a Saturday at 7pm, and it was packed. Make reservations ahead of time for sure."}
{"text":"If you looking for Fresh Organically made food then this is the place to go! 
It is situated on Niagara St, half a block south of the bustling King west st area. 
The great thing about the cafe, is that it is owned an operated by a former sommelier of some big name restaurants in the city! 
For the most part their menu is Mediterranean / french bistro. 
I personally love the Roasted Sunchoke Salad, followed by the Grilled Lamb Saddle. Absolutely amazing, and paired with the proper wine selection (talk to the owner, selections vary) this place is a perfect spot for a wonderful culinary experience. 
The fine dining experience wouldn't be possible without the incredible service staff. 
Be sure to bookmark this restaurant, and make a reservation prior to going. The quaint, yet elegant dining room makes this a perfect spot if your looking to impress that special someone!"}
{"text":"When you're planning a romantic candlelit dinner with your partner to celebrate his birthday, you want everything to go perfectly. Especially if last year's birthday dinner was decidedly very meh and so you want this year's to be absolutely perfect. Needless to say, I had high hopes for our dinner at Niagara Street Cafe.

First, the ambiance: warm and casual, yet romantic. Softly lit candles, dim lights, amazing service. Absolutely A+. 

For our first course, we ordered the Lobster Mushroom Thermidor, a puff pastry filled with sauteed lobster mushrooms. When it arrived, however, the puff pastry was tough and rubbery (as if it had been microwaved too much and then left to get cold) and the mushroom filling was cold. Very disappointing. At this point I started to panic, as it didn't set a very good precedent for the rest of the meal.

AND THEN the aged striploin came out. Holy moly, it was amazing. So amazing that I forgot how bad the appetizer was. It's served medium rare and sliced super thin. It's like meat butter, that's how tender an succulent it is. The mac and cheese we ordered as one of our sides was awesome, too -- creamy and accented with bacon jam. Bacon jam! 

Even though my diet-conscious husband didn't order a birthday dessert, they brought him out a candle anyway, stuck onto a little tea plate. So cute. I, on the other hand, ordered a citrus pot de creme, which was plated really nicely and accented with a green tea chantilly. It was a nice, delicate end to the meal. 

I'd definitely come back to Niagara Street Cafe. I'm hoping that bad appetizer was just a one-off. I can't wait to check out this restaurant again to make sure. :)"}
{"text":"Looking in to this little cafe, it looks small, inviting and romantic. Well, all 3 of these are very descriptive of what's actually going on inside. I loved the feel of this restaurant when I stepped in. The only thing that was a little off putting is the empty patio that makes it look like the restaurant has been abandoned. 

The menu was a one page, size 30 font, which made for a snappy decision making, which is so not me. Even with the few selections that I had to choose from, it took me longer than necessary to choose an option. I went with the daily soup of clam chowder and the duck confit with brown butter gnocchi. My date had the mushroom thing and the catch of the day. I loved my clam chowder but it was a little too watery for my liking but nevertheless, the best clam chowder I've had to date. The mushroom thingy that my date had was...mushroomy, it was just too much fungus for one plate, it was overpowering.

The tuna that my SO had was cooked perfectly but there wasn't anything special about it. The sauce was bland, the marinade was bland and the side dishes were bland. Meh. My duck confit was good, the outside was a little too crispy for my liking but the inside meat was tender and flavourful, I could have done with the gnocchi as it has never been a favourite of mine but it did taste good. 

The most disappointing thing about the whole evening was the dessert menu. There were 3 in total: apple raisin cake, homemade scone and churros...which one of these sounds appetizing? Well let me tell you, it was NOT the churros! They tasted like...an old fashion donut with a cubed sugar coating, it was not good at all. 

The night was wonderful, it was romantic and the ambiance was great as was the server, he was friendly and available but not intrusive or creepy. It was the ambiance, decor and company that gave the 3-star rating, the food was decent at best and the dessert seriously made me give one less star. It's a great idea that everything served is local and organic but realistically, if I were a vegetarian (and not a pescatarian), what would I eat because there was not one non-meat dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Delectable! Small, romantic little joint, casual dining. Had the venison, and a chocolate moussey-cake for dessert. I'm going back, I need that venison again. The service was also excellent. Even the bread was awesome. Add this place to your list for intimate, delicious, reasonably priced dining."}
{"text":"With more and more people moving into Liberty Village and King Street West, and as the area becomes more up-scale and less Parkdale, there's going to be a call for non-franchised independent restaurants that lead towards the finer side of dining.  With this in mind, the Niagara Street Café has placed itself in the neighbourhood so quietly, you'd never realize that it was there.  Which is a shame, as the food here is magnificent.

A very small restaurant and intimate setting, the Niagara Street Café has a dark candle-lit interior that makes for a very nice intimate and romantic setting.  You wouldn't go as far as \"quaint\", but when you see the size of the place and the number of tables, you can see why it's imperative that you reserve.  The wine list is ample and is broad enough in range to accommodate the ever-changing menu.  Boasting as it does on its website (http://www.niagarastreetcafe.com), its use of \"naturally raised meats, organic dairy, and local artisan products\", the menu is never static, changing to use what is fresh and in-season making this restaurant one of the most dynamic in the area.  Don't let the \"café\" moniker fool you."}
{"text":"I came into this charming cafe with my cousin who lives in the neighborhood. This is her go-to place for dinner and eats here almost every week. I can see why. 

a) The menu changes frequently. Not sure exaclty how frequently, but I went twice in a span of about 3 weeks and the menu had already changed. Very important if you are planning on eating there often.

b) everything is delicious!! 

c) it's romantic, but homely. not intimidating at all. 

d) the service is great

4 STARS! It's just a tad more expensive than  cooking at home :)"}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant was the venue for my early Valentine's Day celebration. I've read all the glowing reviews about how great the food is and the romantic ambiance. Stepping inside the dimly lit restaurant scattered with tables for 2 and 4. There are dark brown leather banquettes that sit really high, white table cloth strewn tables, black chairs, a divider separating the two parts of the restaurant down the middle, mirrors on both sides of the restaurant, and small tea lights on every table that left for a small and romantic feel.

Service here is refreshingly charming. Upon arrival, the hostess takes your coat and leads you to your table. The server seems to always pop up at the right time without intruding. You never feel like you're being pushed by the server but welcomed. Food came quicker than expected. As soon as the bread was finished, food was out. Great timing.

So far this restaurant is looking top-notch. The limited menu aides in picking something quickly. I started with the mushroom terrine and chose the daily wild fish which was albacore tuna with rapini and garlic mashed potatoes. My SO started with the clam chowder and had the duck leg confit with brown butter gnocchi. 

I found the mushroom terrine to be a little bland. I know they are mushrooms but truffle oil and a bit of salt go a long way.

The clam chowder was flavorful but slightly thin for my tastes.

My albacore tuna was cooked rare and was delicious. The rapini was perfectly cooked and the garlic mashed potatoes had a light pillowy texture. Each of the items were delicious on their own but I felt something was missing to tie them all together. I was hoping for a little more finesse, being the daily special. 

The Duck leg confit was tender and flavorful. The serving size was enormous and the brown butter gnocchi was of perfect consistency but I felt the combination of the duck with gnocchi sat very heavily in your stomach and made for an extremely dense meal.

Overall, this little romantic restaurant is charming with amazing service. The food here is good and I had a hard time gauging whether the prices were right. I know it's all organic and local but execution should be done with finesse and polish. I would say if you are looking for a romantic restaurant this is it and is worth your money for service and atmosphere alone."}
