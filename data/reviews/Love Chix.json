{"text":"I ordered a whole chicken and 3 sides through foodora,  It was just okay.  The brussel sprouts with parmesan were burnt and inedible.  The coleslaw and potatoes and beets were forgettable.  The chicken came with a big portion of sauce that tasted like club house packaged gravy.  The chicken was fine but not any better than a roasted chicken from the grocery store.  I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"My spouse and I came here one day after work on a Wednesday. Sat on their patio and ordered a round of their $5 pint special. Can't remember name of beer but it was craft beer - but pretty good!   We ordered the half chicken with fried brussel sprouts and fries. It came out and while it looked delicious , it didn't seem like it was enough food for both of us. I was wrong.   The chicken was cooked perfectly; crispy on the outside, moist inside. Brussel sprouts were so good!! Great taste and not greasy at all from being fried. Fries were also delicious - along with the house made ketchup. Everything was very well thought out and put together and by the end of it, we were so stuffed we couldn't finish!   All and all it was a great meal, with great service. Only thing I can suggest - make menu a little clearer. It was a bit confusing but after asking our server, she explained it to us."}
{"text":"We live around the corner and go there frequently. Best chicken I've ever had! The service is awesome, great atmosphere, adorable patio :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.. Awesome relaxed place. Great food and Ontario beer. Great addition to neighbourhood.. Best fried chicken in Toronto.."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazed by this place!  Have been to Love Chix for several different occasions and they have impressed me and my partner every time.  The food is so fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. The staff  is so friendly and helpful. I could go on and on and on. I'd recommend trying the brussel sprouts, fried chicken and what ever beer the bartender thinks will best suite your pallet  Go in and give them a try!   Thank you for coming to the neighbourhood Love Chix Team"}
{"text":"I will give this place a solid meh. The food was pretty good, especially if you like chicken which I do. It's very small though, so not too accommodating for large groups. Service was friendly and atmosphere was okay. My main issue with the place is the price. Main portions (i.e. the chicken sandwich, burger) are made so large that you don't need a side, but I think it would be better if they were a bit smaller and came with a side for more variety. You can add a side on your own but it's another $7 to the $14 you're already paying, which seems pricey for a restaurant advertising itself as casual. I ordered an $8 craft beer and was upsold by the server to another craft beer that wasn't on the menu, which turned out to be $13. That was a bit of a turn-off for me. I live nearby so it's possible I'll give it another shot for brunch, we'll see..."}
{"text":"When I first saw Love Chix open up in my neighbourhood my first thought was, \"how can this chicken place compete with all the Portuguese churrasquiera places found at every corner of this area?\"  Well, after ordering their Whole Bird a few of times now, I know the answer - really good chicken.  Not only is the amount of seasoning perfect, the flavour and the juiciness of their chicken is, dare I say, better than any of the churrasquerias around.  The white meat is so tender and juicy.  I'm not normally a gravy person, but their gravy is delicious.  I also enjoy their fried brussel sprouts with Parmesan as a side.  It also helps that they have super friendly service and a speedy takeout.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer , great service, and great food! Can't wait for the upcoming plans with the patio and upstairs!"}
{"text":"Would love to give a proper review but since the online menu from their delivery service doesn't give a fried chicken option (?????!!!!) and they are unaware of what's on their menus online I can't really review (yes, that's what they told me \"I dont know what the menu on foodora looks like\"). um it's your restaurant, your menu, maybe check it out?   Not a fair review but ffs don't offer a delivery service without knowing what the hell you offer? She told me to check out uber eats. Lol, how about i just find somewhere else that's familiar with their own menu."}
{"text":"Love Chix is a place I find myself returning to time and again. Their patio is lovely, the bar is always a good spot to eat a meal, the staff are friendly, and the food is amazing. There is always a rotating menu of local craft beers. I'm not usually one to order something that I can easily make at home but their roast chicken and gravy is crack-like. The honey hot sauce on the fried chicken is delicious. All the veggie side dishes are GENEROUSLY portioned and tasty. There is something for everybody on the menu - my parents always want to go to Love Chix when they are in this part of town."}
{"text":"Tried this place at Assembly Hall and wasn't too impressed with the chicken.  It was cooked nicely but the sauce was way too sweet for me and everyone else in my party.  The one thing that I did love was their brussel sprouts.  They were bursting with flavor and surprisingly we crushed those quicker than the chicken.  Chicken: 6/10 Brussel sprouts: 9/10"}
{"text":"I was really close to giving 4 stars but I couldn't do it.   The food is really quite good as is the service, however,  there were more than several times where I felt my order was not worth the price.   The breaded chicken with buttermilk ranch is excellent as is the Brussel sprouts with parmesan. Chicken poutine was also really great.   However, my friends and I have ordered several other things on the menu and the meal was often much smaller than expected for the price.    On another occasion I ordered the roast potato salad as take out and what I got..  Well I was almost offended. Wilted greens and 5 small slices of soggy \"roast\" potatoes.   So yeah,  some really fantastic menu items offset by a few of terrible experiences."}
{"text":"I'd order from these folks again.  What I really liked about them were the sauces they gave to accompany the chicken.  The sides were nice too.  I think their menu no longer shows fried chicken, which is a shame because that was our favourite.  I think we'd just get take out from there, but the place is nice too.  It's a place that wasn't loud or anything, making for a very welcoming and enjoyable space.  I suppose if I weren't saddled down with child, I'd actually sit down in a restaurant and eat more often."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best fried chicken ever! 5pc meal was smaller than expeced: 2 wings, 2 boneless thighs or partial breast, 1 drumstick. Brussel sprouts to die for. Very messy, wetnaps not provided but much needed. Get a homemade ginger ale from the ramen shop."}
{"text":"Upon moving to the Junction Triangle, I was determined to have a go-to restaurant where I could become a regular. It only took a few days to get a recommendation that I should pay a visit Love Chix.   Their side-patio is situated so that you not only get the morning sun (perfect for bunch) but also the afternoon sun (perfect for an after work beverage). I first went for Brunch and just so happened to meet the Head Chef who happen to be serving us. I ordered the Brussell Sprout Eggs Benedict, which was unbelievably different and so good that both my friend and I went back for Dinner that same day. For dinner I ordered the Mussels with a side order of the Parmesan Fries. After speaking with the Head Chef he knew about my addition to hot sauce and made a special broth for the Mussel which I am still dreaming about and continue to go back for. It is a MUST to try the honey hot sauce. I've bought jars of it and finished in a day eating it with a spoon. Although, yes, they do specialize in chicken they have great vegetarian options that are packed with flavor and they make the best Caesars in the city! Also, try Nomads and Prophets beer by Collective Arts for a refreshing beer! Sometimes they carry a merlot cider! GO!"}
{"text":"Had the 3pc fried chicken with a side of arugula/beet/goat cheese salad at the new Assembly Chef's Hall. Total was about 20$ taxes in. The portion size was equivalent to a McDonalds happy meal. The three pieces constituted a small drumstick, a wing (yes, a WING!) and what appeared to be a back piece with nearly all bone and no meat. Flavour of hot/sweet was a gooey mess. This place makes KFC look like a Michelin star restaurant (and I don't like KFC). For what you get it's a complete price gouge. Do it right people-- one leg, one thigh, half a breast."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but very pricey for what it is. It's got a pretty relaxed patio and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a beautiful Saturday, and they had a small but nice patio open that felt a lot more like a picnic in the neighborhood than a restaurant. Made for pretty cool atmosphere.  They had a nice 14 oz steam whistle special for $5, and pairing that with a dish of their Fried Chicken slathered in hot honey sauce and ranch dip, it made for one of the best springtime chicken experiences I've had in a long time. I had to order a second round to share with the friends I was with. Only wish that the portions were bigger, and maybe came with a side for the cost of the fried chicken.  Would definitely come back for fried chicken, but if they were able to increase the value of their fried chicken (more with it than just chicken), it definitely would attract a lot more regulars."}
{"text":"We've eaten here for dinner several times and it was great. So, we thought we'd take some out of town friends there for brunch. Not so great.  Brunch options: almost half the menu items include avocado and the waitress/hostess, upon opening told us that they were all out of avocado, for Sunday brunch. Really, queen? While we get it's not necessarily on her- felt like a huge fail when you offer Sunday brunch, and again approx half of your menu incorporates avocado.  We ordered coffee and were asked if we like cream and sugar (FYI-they do not have alternative milk options) the majority asked for milk, one for sugar. We were surprised (I was horrified) when the waitress returned with all of our coffees prepped by her. ?!?!  Generally milk & cream are served on the side for the customer to add, as well as sugar, right? Two had the butter chicken & naan dish:  the sauce tasted overwhelmingly of tomato and a place that builds its rep on its chicken, the chicken was bland and rubbery. One had the pancake platter, and felt they were OK but had experienced better in the TO for less or the same price.  I had the Cassoulet of chickpeas, leather hard chorizo, a solid poached egg (menu says eggS), avocado (they subbed with tomato slices- which don't make up for avocado) and toasted ciabatta.  Food was lacklustre, there was no LOVE in this equation, coffee was brown water. Not going back for brunch."}
{"text":"I must have a different criteria for fried chicken sandwiches than the rest of these reviews, because I was not impressed.  I ordered the sandwich with fries, which came close to $20. Not a cheap lunch.   The chicken batter was amazingly crunchy and the chicken inside was tender. Unfortunately I found that sauce completely ruined it. The sauce was sour and salty. In combination with the over-vinegary coleslaw on my sandwich, it was too much sour in one dish. I ended up taking off all of the slaw and half my bun, which didn't taste very fresh. On the upside, the fries were good.  This must be karma for branching out and trying something new ... Back to my usual order of Ramen at Chef's Assembly Hall."}
{"text":"Came across Love Chix by accident and it was probably the best blessing of my week.   I got the hot chicken sandwich with Brussels sprouts as a side. The sandwich was soooo good, it's sweet and sour with a slight kick to it and the chicken was fried to perfection. This is something I highly recommend to everyone trying this joint out! I got the Brussels sprouts because I've heard good things about it and honestly it wasn't my thing, just a personal preference.   Overall I loved this place, the owners are very welcoming and nice and the decor is so cute."}
{"text":"This is a favourite haunt of those who live int he neighbourhood. As their name suggests, they specialize in chicken. It's a pleasure to have a nice sit-down location in a neighbourhood full of Portuguese churrasqueiras (bbq and rotisserie, often take-out only).  Atmosphere: It's a pleasant casual spot, clean and charmingly decorated. A great place for conversation as it's never loud. They have the option of a larger table that sits about 6, some high top tables and seats at the bar.  There are some good wine and beer choices but we usually focus on the cocktails. They used to sell some of their fresh produce, but we're not entirely sure if that's still a thing. In the summer they have a nice little patio off to the side with picnic tables.  The Food: They make all the best chicken dishes - roti, caesar salad, chicken burgers, chili, hot and cold sandwiches, butter chicken, and whole roasted chicken! We particularly like that dishes can include both dark and white meat.  Brunches include omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, steak and eggs, cassoulet amongst other things.  We come here mostly for the amazing crunchy fried chicken with honey and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Very good hot chicken sandwich, next time I'd ask for less sauce (dripping).. Nice clean interior.  Great addition to area."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for almost killing me.  You would expect a sandwich to have no bones? Take a look at my photos.  Nearly choked to death. Hey owner! Want to take accountability and actually respond? Your sandwich is tasty but I'll pass from now on after almost dying."}
{"text":"I've had their chicken sandwich at least 8 times.  Loved it every single time until I nearly died chocking on a bone in their sandwich."}
{"text":"Set up in the junction area, Love Chix really is all about chicken.  First off, the highlight of this place is that patio. Massive and there always seems to be room. Known for sourcing fresh and local ingredients.  For me the highlight of this place is their roasted chicken and the choice of sides to select from. In fact, the sides were pretty damn delicious. We had ordered the mushrooms and potatoes. Both cream and flavourful. Real bummer I had to share. I mean sharing is a good thing and probably good for my waistline to share.  Drinks, beer and cocktails are plentiful - definitely for the patio,  The main disappointment for me was the chilli chicken. Basically drowning in sauce. I definitely think this would be better tossed in the sauce or perhaps incorporated those more on the exterior then as a side sauce.  It's a great little spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The sandwiches and sides are unbelievable and there's a great patio for enjoying your meal in nice weather."}
{"text":"Was ok, the chicken is a bit over burned. The side was ok.   The spice source on the chicken is a bit over dressed. The chicken isn't juicy enough or tender.  But I really like the decoration of the restaurant. The service is great."}
{"text":"Finally got to the Assembly Hall Food Hall today and decided to try Love Chix.  Had the chicken sandwich with a side of roasted brussel sprouts.   Was incredibly yummy!  Nice soft bun, and the fried chicken was tossed with a great sauce.  The roasted sprouts were tossed with grated parmesan and were a fab accompaniment.  If that is not your fancy, they have a beet and goat cheese salad or fries.  You can also get a 3 piece dinner instead of the sandwich.  The Peach iced tea was a great way to wash it all down.   Was very busy but the wait was not too bad.  The bigger challenge was finding a seat -- but we managed.    Tip!  12 noon to 1 pm seems to be the busiest time.  We noticed that the place thinned out after 1 pm.  There are also great options to get an alcoholic beverage with your meal if you like and some great looking cupcakes at a stand across from Love Chix (if you are looking for something sweet to finish off your meal)!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends while looking for a place to eat, and it was a great experience overall. Friendly service, delicious chicken, and the sides were great too.  A bit pricey per dish however, but the whole chicken deals are very reasonable (and honestly not pricey) when split between a group of 3-4. The other group deals also seem very worth trying out."}
{"text":"I tried the food at the assembly hall and I had an unpleasant experience. I attend the assembly chefs hall on opening day, I looked around and the Love Chix attracted me. Loved the art work and logo. I was hungry and as I was looking at the menu a server asked me if he can help me.i ask him for spicy chicken sandwich with out coleslaw. the food was ready fairly quick.  Presentation was good.... but I was not entirely happy with the meal. The chicken was cold ( room temp) not spicy, dry, and no flavour at all. Bun was stale.  It was as if they were closing and they gave me what's left in the warmer.   I was not happy at all... so after just two bites I lost my appetite and left disappointed.  Fast forward to two weeks later... I was driving on DuPont st and noticed a Love Chix restaurant... so I thought to myself let's try again. I ordered exact same item and I found it 100 times better than the one I had at assembly hall. Chicken was hot, juicey and tender. Spicy and fully of flavour and the bread was fresh. I liked it and I enjoyed the sandwich. I just wished I dined at that location 1st before assembly hall.  You guys are doing good. Assembly hall should be a prime spot to promote love Chix. I hope you have elevated the service and food quality."}
{"text":"I ordered the three piece with fried brussels sprouts at the Assembly Chef's Hall. I am a huge lover of fried chicken and chicken wings in general. This chicken was juicy and tender, with satisfyingly crispy skin. The sauce is acceptable. The fried brussels sprouts was okay, but I wish it were more crispy. At this price, I was hoping for something more. As a reference, I could get much more satisfaction out of an order of Korean fried chicken with way more options in flavour as well as more crave-worthy sides. Love Chix's doesn't strike me as an extraordinary piece of fried chicken. It's just not clear to me what more Love Chix has to offer and why they're so hyped and overpriced. I somewhat regret buying it as I could've saved stomach space for all the other things I wanted to try at the Assembly Chef's Hall."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Friday! Paul & Michelle (the owners) are super warm and friendly, and the food and drinks were top notch. Be prepared for a very hearty meal! Very cool and friendly vibe inside as well. The fried chicken was tender and the hot sauce had a nice bit of kick to it! We also had the rotisserie chicken which came with gravy, great flavors all round. On the side we had  fries as well as two specials, a sauteed mushroom mix and a broccoli+cheese dish. Everything was delicious. My wife and I are looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tastes and service here. We got a big social platter to share amongst the four adults and two kids.   The platter was abundant and tasty. We added extra veg on the sides plus steak as well. There was enough food to stuff each one of us, and the flavours were very yummy. Also enjoyed the view into the kitchen where the team shared with me their epic oven for roasting chickens, which helps keep them moist and delicious.   Service was authentic, kind and helpful. No pressure just informative and supportive of our experience.   I'll come back given the chance."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best fried chicken in the city. The Brussels sprouts are second to none. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually am not a fan of fried chicken because it's greasy af and not good for me, but Love Chix is like a higher class KFC. The food was really good but I personally just don't like fried chicken that much which is why I gave it a 3 stars.  We ordered a whole chicken and was given the option of having half of it roasted and the other deep fried to crispy. On the sides we had a butter chicken (which was my favourite part of the meal), roasted brussel sprouts and a salad on the side.   I don't think I would come with just one person the next time if I was to return but this place is great for groups and for those who love a good chicken."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken, curry of the day and 2 sides. Highly recommend their chicken and brussel sprouts, the best I've had in the city.  The owner was a pleasure to talk to as well! Wish it was closer to downtown Toronto, but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Casual dining experience with obvious focus on chicken. The meat was moist, sauce had a nice flavour and paired with chicken nicely. Fresh ingredients, locally sourced and organic. Service was nice too.  The three stars can improve just needs something but hard to put a finger on it. Worth a shot, especially if you love chicken!"}
