{"text":"Pricey, but this place is probably my favourite in Toronto. The food is meticulous, artful and delicious. I also like that they have local/organic ingredients. The service is also excellent. Once they were a mere 5 minutes late in getting us a table for my reservation, yet they still gave us a glass of wine on the house."}
{"text":"Even with a groupon (making my meal significantly discounted) this restaurant was a terrible experience. This may be jumping to conclusions, but I'm pretty sure our waitress forgot to put in our orders. We ordered bread (yes you have to pay for this) and It didn't come for an hour. How long does it take to cut up a loaf of bread? Even the table next to us (who sat down after us) got their bread right away!  So obviously after 40 minutes we were annoyed and we told the waitress we haven't been served anything we ordered yet. Not only did she not apologize or show sympathy, she was actually rude about it. Seriously the worst service I've ever had. I'd also like to add I don't think I saw her smile ONCE for the entire dinner service. Was not remotely enjoyable to be served by her in any way, shape, or form.  Now on the to the food. Let me tell you, it's not much better than the service. Dishes were either completely bland, or overly salty. The homemade pasta that we ordered came with a total of 2 clams, and tasted like it was made with the sea water that the seafood came in. The BC Cod was overcooked and had absolutely no seasoning. The only palatable thing of the night was the Albacore Tuna Crudo which was surprisingly fresh.   It's really a shame that this restaurant didn't dazzle me. Because the venue is absolutely beautiful. Loved the chandeliers and the romantic candle lit atmosphere. I would possibly consider coming back for a drink or something, but never again for any food."}
{"text":"I've been to Lucien twice. The first time I tried the 5 course tasting menu and it was a great experience when paired with fitting wines. The second time was a date and we went a la carte but the experience was a bit more bland.  The space is very well fashioned and sophisticated with an ambiance that suggests you can get lost in loquaciousness as the wine keeps flowing or dive deep and have an intimate conversation with your partner.  The dishes has never blown me away but have been pleasant to try. I had deer the last time I was there and asked for it medium rather than medium rare, but found it to be mediocre and chewy. Still, the juicy asparagus appetizer which came before was excellent.  The menu has lots of choice but it doesn't overwhelm you and the service is friendly and sufficient. Of course, the prices are high given the location and intended clientele.  All said, it's never been an inspiring place for me, but I may visit again in a few months to a year."}
{"text":"Went there with my fiancé for a sat evening dinner, to sum it up, the food was very good, but our server was terrible, the moment I rejected his insane suggestion to buy a 100$ bottle of wine and went with a $56 one, he ignored us the entire time, I don't even know why I left him any tip at all. But again, their chef is amazing, but they seriously need to fire half their waiters and hire ones that actually provide good service as that is a critical part of upscale restaurant experience.  So if the owner of lucien is reading this, your chefs are great, the gnocchi's were amazing, your service staff are beyond terrible thus two stars review instead of 4 I would of otherwise given."}
{"text":"Small portions and mediocre food, which I found insulting for the price. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting way more. I wish I'd gone back to Noce (queen west). Definitely won't go again."}
{"text":"What a difference a year makes! Last spring, with Groupon in hand, we treated out-of-town friends to a stellar dinner at this intimate yet pricey downtown spot. Each course combined the spot-on execution, creative flair and depth of flavour we expect from a high-end restaurant that prides itself on sourcing the finest local ingredients.  Two days ago another Groupon offer brought us back to Lucien. Oh, dear. Lucien's riff on the now-ubiquitous beet salad was bland and forgettable, with none of the zing horseradish should have imparted. My serving of roast chicken pieces filled the plate, but the skin was soggy and the Moroccan flavours--harissa and preserved lemon--sounded more delicious than they tasted. A handful of roasted brussels sprouts--unadorned--were dead ringers for the ones I toss in the oven when I'm pressed for time. And I'd have done better with the chicken! For these prices Lucien serves middle-of-the-road home cooking? My husband's fettucine tossed with fresh herbs and finely minced tuna was pleasant enough, but nothing special. As for the cheese plate, no one bothered to explain what was on it. We won't return until Lucien gets its groove back."}
{"text":"3.5/5. Recommend the duck and pork. The crudo was too thick & cumin over-powered the pot of creme. Great wine selection"}
{"text":"I WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE EVEN IF IT SOMEONE ELSE OFFERED TO PAY.......................................  Watch out, don't eat here, overrated, overpriced, CRAP!  From the beginning this was not good. We made reservations and when we got there we asked for another table, they said \"sure let us set it up\" and then proceeded to give it to someone else like it was normal.  I ordered the pasta (which had maybe 3 tiny pancetta pieces, a few mushrooms and a stale sauce).  Toronto has nice pasta and for $28 @ Lucien, it was about the size of the very nice pastas that they serve as appetizers in ''the Nose'' for $8.    I ordered the house wine by the glass as the others looked like cheap wines and were $12 a glass, the wine also was pretty crappy (worth about $5 a glass).  So in total for 2 pastas (small portions with no meat and little veggies), two not very good glasses of wine-the bill was $86 (without tip) and we left hungry.  I don't mind paying that much when it is well served, decent food in a nice environment with kind servers.  This was none of the above.  If you want to eat well and pay a fair price.  I'd recommend The Nose on Queen East, Black Hoof or Black Skirt   AND NOT THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving ...   Don't judge a book by its cover ...   These are the phrases that come to mind when I recall my summerlicious event at Lucien. This was the most expensive (45$) and yet pleased the least.  I will admit that the ambiance is ok (cool dark lounge vibe) and the service passable (though no one cared to explain the dishes to us - unlike Canoe and Auberge ... AND we felt that everything was rushed - prob due to the lineup at the door).  The real failure was the food. The appetizer was delicious and all the different tastes came together in my mouth. I was sooo hopeful for the next 2 dishes. However, my cod came and I was completely disgusted at it - it was far too salty (masking anything???) and small (about half the size of a cat-food can) and undercooked (it was seared but the inside was still oozing out salty water). I felt like I should return it but didn't want to make a fuss. At this point, I was pissy and irritated. How dare they serve me this? The cheesecake failed to impress - I tasted no cheese and it was dry. My friend had the chocolate mousse and she did not like its texture.  All in all, I would not return for a *licious event. Perhaps one will fare better if you ordered off the regular menu.   I still have nightmares and pangs of regret for dropping 72$ at this joint."}
{"text":"Groupon deal. Good for the discounted price, however would not pay full price for this restaurant. Good service and nice people."}
{"text":"Great food, helpful and friendly service. I had the glazed Tamshire pork and Ontario Red Deer - very tasty and well presented. Probably not much here if you're a vegetarian."}
{"text":"The space is best described as modern Art Nouveau, with an open kitchen so you can spy on the cooks. Dark walls, wood and tiles, wrought iron and pretty chandeliers add charm without being overbearing. Most importantly there were sumptuous dark velvet curtains. I bet on a busy night you can actually have a conversation without shouting because of those curtains. This pleases my inner granny. Yay for noise reducing curtains!  Now on to the important stuff, food:  The dishes are a subtle ode to molecular gastronomy, nothing crazy, no steak ice cream here but there might be a smear of parsnip foam on your plate. (Isn't funny how sometimes not knowing/figuring out what you're eating makes it better)*.  Portions sizes weren't huge by any means. Big enough to leave you satisfied without feeling stuffed so you can enjoy restaurant bread without worrying if you'll be labouring through dessert. I think you're supposed to eat a 3 course meal, here so don't count on dinning on just a main. The 3 of us shared 2 appetizers, the tuna and the pork belly. The tuna appetizer consisted of 4 small slices fresh raw tuna with some veggies. The fish was so delectable that I didn't want the taste to leave my month and was almost sad to start my main. The whitefish that followed was tasty and the other 2 dishes looked equally good. For dessert I had cherry ice cream. It was bang on. It was accompanied with rye streusel, yummy white foamy stuff and a few pieces of celery. The celery definitely worked as it added a crunch and mitigated some of the sweetness, but it wasn't necessary. The fruit cake dessert was even better. It had goat cheese ice cream. Oh, Service was pleasant, unassuming and unobtrusive.  And now for something completely different, a verdict: This strikes me as a great place to have a special/celebratory meal.  Also, if you want to impress clients, friends, and frenemies, Lucien won't disappoint. Was it worth it? Yes. Did I pay? No (thankfully)**. Did I have a great meal? Yes. Was I wowed? No.   Just an FYI the menu online isn't entirely up to date, some of the dishes were pricier and 1 or 2 menu options differed.   * Certain conditions apply. No horses, cats, dogs, rodents, insects, arachnids, worms, slugs, pathogens, endangered species or rotting food allowed. **Even if I did pay, it would still be worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for visiting the smaller gems in Toronto and this place did not disappoint in the food or the service.  I went during the Summerlicious promotion and the place was not as full as I would expect it to be during this season which I found a bit surprising. The server that was with us that day knew the menu very well and had very well-informed suggestions which is rare to find especially during Summerlicious.  I had the dinner menu for $35 which for me consisted of the following:  Albacore Tuna Crudo  Perth County Pork and Seasonal vegetables  Cherries Jubilee  All-in-all, great food and a great environment to be in.

{"text":"Du faux français, du faux canadien-français ? Pas certain. Enfin personne n'y parle un mot de français, c'est évident malgré le nom. Nous y sommes passé pendant un 'summerlicious' ou un 'winterlicious', ces événements où l'on peut découvrir de nouveau restaurants avec des prix fixe. C'était l'occasion de nous impressionner, mais le résultat était fade et sans originalité. Les portions étaient aussi particulièrement décevantes."}
{"text":"I will not be coming back.  The service was very nice, albeit a bit snobby. We had a reservation and (whom I am assuming to be the owner) welcomed us in immediately and showed us to our table. Our server knew a lot about each dish and the little details about it, which is what earned the two stars.  The food, though. Oh goodness gracious, so dry and tasteless! If I am paying $28 for an entree, I kind of expect a few bells and whistles. I got the Berkshire pork. Do not get the Berkshire pork. Get the BC cod, like all three of my friends that I went with. It is just as tasteless, but not as dry. The pork was sad, rubbery and tasteless. And the beans and cabbage just did not set it off like I was so desperately hoping. We also got chicken liver pate as a starter. I've had really delicious pate before and wanted my friends to experience the same. I was so utterly disappointed because they are now turned off of it forever. I mean, I know we did not fit in with the typical Lucien demographic, being a good twenty years younger than the patrons of that night... But we know good food when we see it! And we did not see it.  You can tell a lot about a restaurant by its bread. I am a firm believer in this, as it has been proven true again and again. Lucien's bread was not free and not warm. It was served with a nice oil, which added a small touch but not enough. It was slightly dry and I used the rest of my pate on it, since the portioning of the appetizer left us all with too much pate and nothing else for it to thrive upon. I've had better bread.   We used a groupon deal for it, which significantly reduced our bill ($143-something without tip). That was a relief too, because I would cry if I paid full price of a meal I did not end up liking or finishing."}
{"text":"Minus 1 star b/c their dessert wasn't as awesome as the rest of their food and you can't get 5 stars from me unless your dessert is way yummy!  and minus an invisible star b/c it didn't have a child menu or child option (e.g. rice or pasta) and wouldn't try to offer anything there.  As an Asian-Am and touchy feely parent, I don't go anywhere without my little one (3.5 y/o now) and she has been to the best (french laundry, le bernardin, picasso, chez panisse, etc)  1st course: I got the pork belly. how can you go wrong with that? it was lovely! I tried to cut off the fat, but it was too hard and I HAD to eat the whole thing.  Yum!!  my husband got the sunchoke flan - he devoured it! my friend go french onion soup - not your typical tons of cheese and way to salty onion, very elegant and he liked it.  main course: salmon for the daughter - skin was crispy (crunch!) and meat was so soft and perfectly delicious.  chicken for the husband - again, devoured I got the beef bourginon (my friend who usually hates beef bourginon LOVED it!) came with beef prepared 3 ways! one with bacon, who doesn't love bacon. and 2 short rib. again, you can never go wrong with short rib  my friend had the cod - divine.  dessert - the chocolate sampler - was like 5 pieces of solid dark chocolate. so only for the true dark chocolate lover. with 5 things to dip in - rosewater something, olive oil and balsamic, sea salt, something else. we didn't dip. we just ate the chocolate, but it seemed disappointing. I need a little more something with my chocolate  the \"cheesecake\" came topped with 5 different things e.g. lemon sorbet, chocolate ice cream and something else. That was cool but you wouldn't have expected it nor ordered it based on the description on the menu which did not tell about all the cool stuff on it.  The service was great!! the bread was delicious but a little stingy. 2 small loaves (more like buns) for 4 adults?  we had to fight over them and ask them many times for more b/c they were so delicious  although they didn't have kiddie carbs, they were able to give us great service in helping to make the bottle.  very cool. up to NY and SF standards. would come here again but hope they get better dessert."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Total bullshit on a plate. Completely try hard with zero pay off. It's one thing to serve tiny portions on huge plates with smears and foams. Pretentious? Yes, but done right, the end result can be remarkable, if the food tastes fantastic. This is not the case at Lucien. Parts of our meal were nearly inedible.  I've never spent so much money to be so disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant meals I've ever eaten!  I had the black cod with escargot, salsify, savoy cabbage, bacon and cocoa jus.  I loved the way the chef included multiple preparations of each ingredient. For example, salsify puree and chips.  Pork belly cubes and fried pork rinds.  Yum!  The cod was cooked perfectly, the flavor was so complex, perfectly balanced, divine.  I scraped my plate clean and would've licked it if I was gutsy enough.    The desserts were also incredible.  Sticking with the theme of multiple preparations, the lemon dessert included lemon creme, custard, meringue, and who knows what else.  And then the chocolate and cheese compositions, which allowed us to combine simple ingredients in a variety of combinations... a fun and delightful experience!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, my wife and I stayed in Toronto in June of 2009 and our concierge at the Le Royal Meridien King Edward recommended Lucien. And we truly OWE him now, because it took just one amazing meal for us to fall in love with this restaurant.   Highlights from that evening included: Berkshire Pork, Grilled Octopus, Venison....  We returned to Toronto this past summer to visit family in Guelph, and despite landing at 9pm, our only concern was hoping that Lucien served dinner past 10. Fortunately, they did and we had another simply terrific meal.   Highlights from that evening included: Beet Salad, Salmon, Tenderloin....  Both times, our waiter was Lorne - who was great! Knew the menu inside and out, great wine recommendations and nice as can be!  AWESOME Website, FANTASTIC service, and DELICIOUS food!!!"}
{"text":"We had a list of recommendations for restaurants a mile long during our trip to Toronto and ended up eating very well at Oyster Boy, Foxley, a Jamie Kennedy farmer and winemaker dinner, Starfish, and some excellent casual places like Standard Fish and Chips. The overall quality was very high, but this dinner was better than anything I have ever had outside of Chez Panisse. One particular chef recommended that we go to Lucien since he eats all over the world and had his most memorable meal in ten years there. With a recommendation like that, we had to go and we were glad we did.   The amuse in the beginning was delightful, a mini reuben sandwich with truffled mustard. The chef didn't like that we hadn't ordered the grilled octopus and chorizo dish so he sent it out for us, and it was one of the best appetizers I have had. The octopus sausage seemed a bit creepy to me,  but when I tasted it I quickly changed my mind. The salty, savory flavor of the octopus and chorizo were outstanding.   We had the sunchoke flan, which had a perfect texture and interesting taste, the salad with fried shallots (it was the only miss of the evening, there was no dressing at all on the greens and that really didn't appeal to any of us), and the pork belly, which was fantastic. For mains we shared the lamb and the \"chowder\". The lamb was good, a very solid dish with three preparations, but the chowder was on a whole different level. It was a deconstructed chowder with various seafood and sauces arranged beautifully on a big square plate, my friend observed that it looked like some kind of underwater Tim Burton world.  So much of the time great restaurants fall down on the desserts, but the dessert we had with malt was amazing. Service was good and attentive, wine was tasty, basically all of us loved it!"}
{"text":"A recent Groupon deal brought me to Lucien last week for dinner.   I'll cut right to the chase: The food here is amazing; the prices are quite steep and the portions are small.  Reading the other reviews I thought the place was going to be a chaotic mess in terms of decor. It's really not that 'eclectic' in my opinion. Maybe they were referring to the melted wine bottle chandelier, which I thought was really cool. Apart from that it's quite normal. They did a good job renovating it, as this used to be Pravda.  The service was friendly and fairly quick, although it did fill up rather quickly once we got seated.  For an app, I tried the Red Deer tartare. It was, without better words to describe it, exquisite. I LOVE tartare and this was some of the best I've had. Spiced just right and the bright red of the venison added to the presentation. If it's on the menu, TRY IT.  After perusing the menu and changing my mind a few times, I decided on the pork shoulder. A little fatty but with a fantastic taste. The dish had two good size pieces of pork shoulder and was served with a side of chicharrón. Very delicious.  I also had a little bite of the pasta of the day, which was ok but $25 for a small plate of pasta never sits quite right with me (remember the portions are tiny).  Finally, I had a quick look at the desert menu as we were both still a bit hungry but nothing really appealed to me.  Their menu changes often and the chef seems to know what he's doing so it would be interesting to come back in a few months to check out what's new."}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised at the good reviews of this joint as It was such a disappointment for me and my girlfriends.  Having hopped back on the trying new restaurant train, I was looking forward to trying Lucien. We benefited from the Group on opportunity and headed to the restaurant. The atmosphere is beautiful. Endless bottles on wine surround a massive mirror behind the bar which was really pretty. I can also say the bread that was served at the beginning was delicious.   Unfortunately, I have to stop with the compliments there. The wine list was okay.. We had the Flan which was a bit bland and the Beef Tenderloin and the Black Cod was nothing that wow'd us. We weren't overly impressed with any of the food we were served. Luckily we had the groupon coupon so the meal didn't cost us too much as I would have been even more disappointed.  As least I was in brilliant company. Lucien left me with a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I tried the summerlicious promo around Toronto.  I saw this menu and it looked quite appealing.  We tried every dish on the menu (minus the soup appetizer).  Everything was well plated and portions were very good for lunch.  Service was excellent.  Friendly and attentive.  Water was always topped up.  I would try this place again on a regular night for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Interior is wonderful, elegant and quirky,the ingredients are all local, fresh and seasonal.  I had the split pea soup that was silky and flavorful.   The bread basket was made in house, with butter that was actaully one of my favorite parts of the meal.  Salmon over wheatberries was interesting.  Service was not rushed which gave us time to enjoy each course."}
{"text":"Our family dined at Lucien for the very first time and besides a ridiculous bill, we really didn't have much to show for it.  Portions are among the most modest I've seen in all the fancy restaurants I've been to.  Taste-wise, it was alright...palatable but not noteworthy.  We all agreed on two major pet peeves. Served by the owner, we felt we were repeatedly \"pressured\" into ordering extra because he kept asking if we wanted any appetizers/dessert/alcohol.  Of course we understand it's part of his job to upsell but his demeanour could've been a bit more relaxed.  Most aggravating was that we were charged for water!  There may have been a mix-up in him serving us Evian water over tap water but seriously, shouldn't tap water be provided and refilled automatically without asking?  Our table had to request water refills at least five times!  But then again, the slow refill service may have stemmed from him thinking we only wanted Evian water.  If it indeed was Evian water, we sure couldn't tell!  It tasted exactly like tap water and we were served in what appeared to be refillable glass bottles that had no cap...hardly Evian...  Overall, nice for a one-time experience, severely gouges your pockets and will leave you swearing that you'd never ever return."}
{"text":"Made reservations for Winterlicious and it was a big disappointment. Maybe my expectations for the food were high because of the high price entrees on the regular menu.  The service was okay and at times were a little annoying like Swiss Chalet waiters - friendly but fake. They came out strong but dwindle in the end and were hard to flag down. The decor seems a little confusing. It tries to be classy but the feel was more bar-like, especially with a tv by the bar playing the game. The music playing in the background sounded like old classic rock, which I didn't mind, but seemed out of place for the restaurant.  Food was barely okay. We came for the Winterlicious so it was a set menu with a few choices for each entree. I had the french onion soup, which had raw onions and the cheese curdled in the broth. I chose the duck for my main, which seemed over cooked because it was hard to chew and swallow. They also hid all this shredded duck meat under the sliced pieces of duck which made it seem like they were trying to hide all the messy parts. I just didn't enjoy it. The desert was terrible. I had this banana peanut butter cookie parfait. Bleh, it did not work and the cookie tasted stale and store bought.  I left the restaurant hungry and had to eat at home."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago with a Group coupon that brought it into a more reasonable price range.  The space itself is beautiful, and the service was friendly and efficient.  At this point, the menu has changed and I don't remember off the top of my head what we ordered - but I remember it was good.  Just good.  Not great.  I also remember that the portions were very small.  At that price point, hopefully the food would be great and in good portions, but you at least need one or the other.  Frankly, I was barely satiated with my meal.    All in all, I'm glad I had the coupon because otherwise I would have been upset by how much I'd spent on how little.  The coupon made it a little more acceptable, but I won't return nor would I buy another coupon.  It's just not worth it to me when there's so many excellent restaurants in the same price range or lower."}
{"text":"Good not great.  Almost everything coming out of the kitchen was lacking that extra je ne sais quoi to make it special.  The grilled octopus app was my favourite of the evening by far with deliciously tender fingerling potatoes and tasty chorizo.   Despite ordering a medium rare veal, the piece came out looking overcooked and grey in colour.  Both the waiter and the host insisted it was medium rare and it was the outside light coming through the windows that washed out the vibrant pink one would expect from a properly cooked piece of meat.  They were nice about it and cooked us another one that came out looking exactly the same.. soo uhhh whatever.. it tasted good, just wasn't as juicy and tender as we would've liked it.  The halibut was decent, a little over cooked as well in my opinion, and was drier than I would've liked but it came with an excellent butter sauce with chunks of crab leg and a wasabi green bean puree.  The presentation of all the dishes were outstanding. They looked delicious, just a shame that didn't taste as good as they looked.  The meal came to $550'sh for 7 people and 2 bottles of wine, which is really reasonable considering all the food we ordered, plus desserts, plus wine.  What I appreciated the most was the service, very friendly staff despite the small hiccup, they even bought our table complimentary ice wine to go with dessert.  Overall, I'm glad I can finally strike this off my list of \"must try\" places around the city, but I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Lucien is tucked away at the corner of Leader Lane and Wellington in neighbourhood of the St. Lawrence Market.  I have passed by the dimmed restaurant during lunch hour many times.  However, starting March 5th the restaurant will be open for lunch in hopes of catering to the Financial District's lunch crowd.While I couldn't scribble down enough notes about how to describe the food, the décor had me at a loss of words.  In the end, I settled on one word to describe both the ambiance and food - eclectic. The menu has everything from ramen to pasta to choucroute.   The décor was a mishmash of chandeliers, candles, antique wood, luxurious drapes and textured ceiling.  It was cozy without being claustrophobic, and relaxing.  I would recommend the table for 2 in the nook space by the window for a little more privacy.  Its also great for people watching.  Our server Patrick was every restauraunteur's dream.  Having been 4 years with Lucien, he was engaging without being disruptive and was always within reach.  If Wency Leung's blurb in the Globe and Mail about the drought of qualified restaurant staff being the hindrance to bringing Toronto's restaurant industry on par with the likes of Chicago, Montréal, and New York - then Lucien must be paying top dollars for quality manpower.  Their wine list is not extensive, but by no means limiting.  I was able to find a glass of my beloved Riesling from Tawse Winery, and my dining companion found comfort in a Negroni.   The Thuet bread basket comes at a small price, but its worth it.  The oil was spicy, sweet and tart all at the same time.  I'm all for threesomes now!  I even got to experience a new type of fish - Sablefish.  With a texture very similar to bass, but less flaky and more tender, the soy sauce infused broth entrenched the fish with flavour.   If there's one thing that stands out in my mind about my meal at Lucien, its the textural contrasts that were apparent in every dish.  Be it the crostini and turnip to the red deer tartare, or the honeyed parsnip crisps and malt meringue to the spongey yet crusted financier - every bite was interesting.  Verdict:  Lucien is definitely worth the splurge.  The food is yummy, the restaurant is cozy, and the staff definitely play more than just a supporting role."}
{"text":"An amazing food experience at prices justified by your taste buds, who will go \"WEEE!!!! WEEEE!!! WEEE!!!!!\"   Lucien was such a great find. We walked by in our wanderings as tourists, yelped it later and saw a sort of mixed bag of reviews.   Many of the poorer reviews for Lucien had to do with two things: price and size.   \"The portions were small and it was expensive!\"   You know where portions are plenty and prices are nominal? Burger King. You can get a triple stack for $3! Amazing!   Lucien is not Burger King. Reviews judging the restaurant based food all came out quite positive, and I have another one to add to the list.   The server was very nice, helpful, explained to me what \"fiddleheads\" are. He helped steer me towards the Bison entree and it was amazing. We also got the octopus starter and the pork belly. They were both really good. The veal ribeye was the other entree at the table, which was also good, but owner of said ribeye was a wee bit jealous of my bison.   The brownie for dessert was not my favorite after the whole meal was done, but luckily they brought out the cheesecake by accident and let us keep both. The cheesecake was much better than the brownie but a delight to be able to try them both!   2 apps + 2 entrees + 1 bottle wine ($58) + 1 dessert + 2 cappuccino = $195  So put that in your bison pipe and smoke it. We loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed is the word I would use to describe my experience at Lucien. I loved the design and atmosphere of the restaurant, and from that, I guess I expected something more. I found it interesting that there was really only one waiter, with the other three staff being bussers/bartenders. When any table wanted to place an order, the busser would inform the older gentleman, who I later found out was the owner of the restaurant, and you would then have to wait for him to arrive to take our order. Unfortunately for us, it was a busy night and this meant having to wait for a while.  I went to the restaurant with my girlfriend and we ordered the Octopus for the appetizer, BC Salmon and Alberta Bison for the entrees and the apple and brownie for dessert.   I have to agree with Sara K.P. in regards to the octopus. Neither I or the gf were impressed with it, although it seemed to be more mashed potato than octopus, to be honest. The gf loved her salmon though, while I was disappointed with the bison. I ordered it medium rare, and it lacked any real flavour. The dessert was okay, but the selection available left much to be desired.  At the end of the night, I'm glad I got to try a new restaurant out, but I really have no plans on returning."}
{"text":"I went there on a date recently with a groupon. Nevertheless, I thought the menu was a little pricey for what we ordered. I actually liked the fact that the portions were small, I usually never have any space left for dessert! I had the Arctic char and it was good but it didn't blow my mind. I was also left wondering what was French about the menu... Except for the desserts. I had the delicious poire Helene and it was the best part! Light and refined. The service was polite and personable, my date and I spoke French the whole time and the waiter made a little effort to speak French to us which is always appreciated, though not necessary :). I quite like the decor and the atmosphere was cozy and romantic for a busy Thursday night. If it was a little cheaper I would have probably rated it higher, I just didn't feel it was totally  worth he 160$ bill..."}
{"text":"I know waiters hate when Summer and Winterlicious are on but let's get something clear, if a restaurant participates it should see this as an opportunity to win fans. Yes some of the people that will come because of the Licious events, will never return but then there are the others, the financial district is filled with good restaurants and most participate in this promotion and there is no reason why you wouldn't come back ... oh wait of course there is ... when your Licious event wasn't all that jazz.  Went with co-workers and felt like stuffed sardines at a very crammed and small table, our dishes barely fit the table because the host sat us at a table for 2 when we were 3 people.   Upon arrival we were greeted with \"Can you push in, the AC is on\" - listen I know this is starting to feel like Egypt with these hot temperatures in the city but is there a need for this parent like \"I gotta save money on AC and you're letting the cold air out\" commentary?  Upon being seated and I mean literally after 30 seconds the host was back to take our order, my ass barely made the seat, will you give me a minute?!?  Someone already commented but yes they charge for the bread ... are we in Europe? To top it off what is being passed as Thuet Bakery bread tastes more like the sandwich bread from the Metro down the street.   The food is okay, the dishes were far too salty and I would say the only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the dessert was good.   Thank god this was only $20 pre tax/tip/drinks and while the spot is cute, I'd never return, maybe if they change the host ?!?"}
{"text":"This is a solid addition to the restaurant scene. A very unique setting. The food is well prepared but can be hit and miss. Milk fed lamb was just cooked right and the tenderloin was juicy. Not a bad start and hopefully they will round out their service a bit. Our waitress was clueless."}
{"text":"I just stopped here for a couple drinks, but have never had or seen service this good!  The bar tender was amazing.  Treated us with respect, knew drinks inside and out, and quite frankly made it difficult to move on to our dinner reservations.  I would've just stayed there had we not made plans with a group.  As an example of the service, I was drinking martini's, and each time I ate an olive, I put the pit on a napkin.  He would come clear my napkin and pit away and put a new napkin for my next pit!  A little over kill, but shows you how attentive they are.  As I said, I didn't eat the food this time, (looked great though off others table).  I will be back here for dinner on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"It was a rainy Sunday night on Wellington Street last night and after a day of pounding the floors walking around the One of A Kind Show we decided to indulge (as if my wallet hadn't been pounded on enough) for dinner at Lucien. Lucien has gotten much attention for listings in such places as the Zagat rating and I think has some sort of kudos bestowed upon it for being one of Toronto's top dining spots. It is an upper end Wallet smasher, without question but it was my friend's birthday so we figured WTF, let's go for it.   It was early in the evening as my friend had to catch a 7:20 p.m. train back to London so it goes without saying that the restaurant was very quiet which means the service would be more than sufficient. It's a lovely dining, with an illuminated ceiling of opaque red panels and wrought iron suspended underneath it. There is a quiet elegance about the restaurant and I like that.   Instead of starting with one of the appetizers we opt to order up the cheese plate off the dessert menu to share. Nothing warms one up better than a glass of McManis Cabernet Sauvignon with some Niagara Gold cheese. The cheese plate ($15) I felt was a little light not so much on the cheese (there were 5 small portions from Blue to Niagara Gold) but rather on the condiments that adorn cheese. There was a small smattering of fresh pomegranate seeds, a teeny tiny piece of poached apple, a teaspoon size dribble of a pear jam and three tiny small oat biscuits. The cheese was delicious and all room temperature .   For the mains I opted for my usual Beef tenderloin. It was beautifully plated, sitting atop a bed of seared but not slaughtered spinach. around the plate were little piles of aerated adornments such as squash and even small little blobs of fois gras that you could dip chunks of your meat in to. Very delicious. My only quibble with this plate was that the menu said gnocchi was served with it but it wasn't really gnocchi but rather three small bits of ricotta shaped like gnocchi and topped with finely minced chives. It was OK but for the most part I find ricotta bland and not a cheese I rush to eat. Lucien's kitchen would do better to blend the ricotta with actual potato and make a ricotta stuffed gnocchi instead.   My friend chose the Pork tenderloin atop some pureed potatoes garnished with onions. Again, presentation was impeccable, beautifully laid out with little splotches of this sauce and that glaze on the plate. The guys who plate this food love those little condiment squeeze bottles. My concern with this dish was I felt that the tenderloin was just a bit too rare and I asked my friend twice if the meat was ok. Ultimately he relented and said that it could have been cooked just slightly more. It is one thing for beef to be rare but when it comes to meats like pork and chicken that is an absolute no no.   Our waiter was very friendly and checked in several times to make sure we had what we needed. They kept the water glasses topped up and once I dropped my napkin on the floor he quickly jetted over with a replacement. We did need to ask for a steak knife when they put the food down but other than that the service was good.   The menu at Lucien isn't large. It's a one sheeter, with a starter column, a main column and a finishing column. Under the mains they had listed three fish dishes so if you aren't in to fish you might feel slighted. After that it's one beef, one chicken and one pork dish. As I recall I don't think there was one vegetarian main listed. Prices for first (salads, calamari etc.) run anywhere from $14-$20. That's for a starter. Mains start at $29 and go to $40. Cheapest glass of wine on the menu was $11. Dinner for two without dessert hit $200.   I noted on a previous review that they were served an Amuse Bouche to get their taste buds on the go. There was no Amuse Bouche in sight on Sunday night. Shame. It's the small things that can really make a difference. Dollar for dollar I'd take my beloved Silver Spoon over Lucien any day of the week. Not sure I'd go back to Lucien but I am glad that I did finally get to experience the restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank you Andrea & Dave for bringing us to this new gem! What an amazing find!  Very cool interior, modern, somewhat upscale.   Service - impeccable! The server was so attentive.   Food: I started with the beet and carrot salad. Interesting presentation. Very flavorful. Not a large portion so don't feel like you'll be stuffed if you order a starter.   The french onion soup - like no other I've had. See picture I've uploaded. Again - it's all about the presentation. The aged gouda foam was a nice surprise. The broth is poured at the table.   The Ontario Red Deer was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection. The celeriac was amazing and the cranberries were an excellent addition to sweeten the overall taste.   Black Cod is your dish should you want something on the lighter side. It literally melts in your mouth.   We ordered a few desserts:   Chocolate beetroot brownie - i've never heard of such a thing. If you're a chocolate lover - order it.. delicious!  Lemon Meringue - I'm not a huge fan of lemon anything in my dessert however this one offered a very refreshing option. The hubby loves lemon dessert so this was his favorite.   Ontario Apple Confit - Amazing! The goat cheese ice cream was my favorite.   What a lovely experience. We'll come back again when we're in town."}
{"text":"In town for the Toronto International Film Festival, I feared I would only have time to eat trash between screenings. Instead a friendly oyster shucker at the nearby Starfish pointed me upwards Lucien. Woefully underdressed compared to the other patrons, we were still welcomed and appreciated. More importantly, their salmon was perhaps the best I've ever eaten. The gazpacho was quite nice. And we were treated to a complimentary glass of port from the manager. An excellent meal all round."}
{"text":"great restaurant. super friendly service, nice atmosphere, good food. we went there got winterlicious and had a great evening."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place!  Everything was excellent from the food to the vino!!! And it is open Sunday nights. Great interiors also."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this upscale restaurant from a couple of my friends.  The layout was nice and intimate with a wee bit of a rustic meets elegant jive.  Although my first impression of Lucien was on the up in up, it was pretty much a slide down hill from there I am afraid.    Maybe it's the location, but I found this place a bit stuffy in a middle aged businessmen kinda way.  Perhaps my gf and I should just stay in Parkdale, Junction or Queen west? lol.. There was another young couple sitting right next to us and I caught various patrons starring in our direction like we were some sort of science experiment, it was uncomfortable to say the least.   Service was tight and friendly without being fake.... very genuine.   The food was pretty good for normal standards, however, I would compare this in the same caliber as, say Black Hoof.   Having said that, it was sub par in comparison.   My gf boasted about their online menu having foie gras ice cream, which they did not have... in fact the online menu was completely different from the menu that was presented that evening.  Granted I expect some changes to the menus, however, consistency is a must in an establishment like this... just look at Ruby Watch Co., they literally change the menu everyday and it's completely consistent with the website.   I had the Pork Tongue and my gf got the Bibb Salad both at $12, I totally got the better end of the deal.  For the main, I had the Fresh water Trout with Celery Root Puree which was really nice; the trout was cooked exactly the way I like it, the highlight of my experience at Lucien.   We had 2 apps, bread, wine and 2 mains... the bill came out to $170 excluding the tip.    For what we paid for at Lucien, we should have had a stellar experience like at Black Hoof as mentioned.     I like this place but it missed the mark in some ways."}
{"text":"I was lured to this place with a groupon but left a bit disappointed.   Nice, clean, upscale decor and the type of place that is perfect for date night.   We ordered only mains and a dessert because even with the groupon this place is pricy (and overpriced for what we had, in my opinion).   I had the steak which was okay. Was overcooked and bland. Came with mushrooms and a sauce that didn't really taste like anything? Mushrooms have a mild taste so that with the sauce didn't really add anything to the dish.   My sister had the whitefish stuffed with pork jowl, which she liked, but she mentioned that the taste of the pork jowl was so overpowering that she couldn't taste anything else. To me, that defeats the point of serving both of the proteins if you're cant taste anything but the one.   For dessert we shared the pear tart with white chocolate ganache, white chocolate sponge toffee, and chocolate ice cream. Was not a fan of the crust or ganache. Did not taste fresh or recently made. Tart was a bit hard to get through so my sister scooped out the ganache and ate it. The sponge toffee was awesome, but the ice cream was WOW. Maybe Lucien needs to open up an ice cream joint cuz that ish was INCREDIBLE. seriously, I was about ready to lick that plate clean!  Okay experience, but I don't think I'll be heading back here anytime soon, even with the delicious ice cream as a lure."}
{"text":"Went here last night.  I hadn't been to Lucien in probably two years (despite the many Groupons/vouchers I've seen offered online).  First off, this is no longer Lucien Restaurant!  It's now Olde Towne Oyster Bar.  Despite the website still being up for Lucien, the owner (?) stated it should be taken down soon, and the menu has changed (I have posted a photo of the new menu).  No renovations were done, so it's basically the same decor/atmosphere with new menus and name.  Also, the restaurant was completely dead except for us and another table of two, for the entire 1.5 hours we were there.  Instead of the tasty dishes I remember from my previous visits, we were greeted with a much smaller menu.  They are jumping on the bandwagon of offering 'sharing' dishes, and even stated that their 'mains' were pretty small (a strange admission).  Food: We started with the Thuet bread.  Tasty enough, but only 4 small pieces and some olive oil/balsamic/pepper mix. Then we had: Warm Mediterranean Olives - Plenty given, tasted like grocery store ones Smoked Salmon - 3 fair sized pieces with bread and capers.  Tasty Trio of Seared Jumbo Scallops (uploaded picture) - Very tasty, but not so jumbo Albacore Tuna Crudo - Not bad, but we weren't impressed.  Not very fresh. We finished with one of each dessert.  Best part of the meal.  The Chocolate cake was warm and melty in your mouth.  The Creme Brulee was most excellent (and I'm not a big fan of them).  Drinks: I had a Steam Whistle.  No complaints. My friend the house white wine.  She thought it was pretty weak (house wine after all).  Service: No complaints.  Frequent refills and dishes cleared.  Overall Impression?  Meh.  I preferred the old Lucien.  Maybe they'll get better and offer a few more shard plates that actually jump out at you.  I won't be going back unless I see some changes.  There are too many other places I would rather try."}
{"text":"After all the raving I had heard about this place, my fiancée and I finally used a Groupon as a motivation to try it out.  Unfortunately, our experience was anything but memorable and we will never be returning here again. Too bad because it is right at our doorstep and we really wanted to enjoy it here.  The staff was nice and very accommodating, my fiancée had some flowers delivered and they had them nicely set up on the table but the food is what ruined it for both of us.  I ordered the pork shoulder which I assumed would taste more like a fall of the bone kind of pork and my fiancée ordered the fish. His fish was average, nothing to write home about and better than my pork, which was horrible.  I don't think I have ever been so put off by a meal in a restaurant before. The pork looked more like pork loin which was cut into medallions and the meat was very rubbery and stringy, it looked and tasted undercooked. It also had a very strong flavour which I have never tasted in pork before, it tasted stale, definitely not fresh. The pork came in a sauce which helped mask the horrible flavour of the meat, when I ran out of the sauce, I could no longer take another bite and was swallowing more than chewing just to get it over with.  I would have complained but my fiancé insisted we just pay our bill and leave. I really regret this but when we started sharing our bad experience we heard the same from other people about the oysters not being fresh."}
{"text":"Over the years I've grown very cynical of Winterlicious. It seems that a lot of restaurants don't really treat this event well, and sub the regular menu with much cheaper and more generic food that is easier to produce en masse. However, this year, I decided to give a few a try, with Lucient on the top of my list of restaurants that I had heard about but did not try yet. It looked promising for Winterlicious since it looked like their Winterlicious menu  actually had items from their regular menu.  We started off our early Friday night dinner with Braised Berkshire Pork and Cauliflower Soup as appetizers. The pork was deliciously fatty and the soup was light as air. Delicious! Next came the Top Meadow Farms Beef Bourguignon - nicely braised and tasty, but nothing special. For dessert I had the Ontario Apple Cobbler while my boyfriend got the Lemon Meringue. Both were inventive and good. I was impressed with my Winterlicious experience here and would return here again for the regular menu - which is what Winterlicious is all about - attracting new customers.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Lucien. The service was good, the decor was intimate and cozy, and the food was tasty and original."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this place. Fortunately there was a Wagjag during the time. Went here for a date. Loved everything we order. We had the pate appetizer, pasta and steak. The staff was friendly but like the other review said.. they forget about you at the end. FYI its a pricy rest"}
{"text":"I went here with a business colleague to try their summerlicious menu. The service was quick and friendly - just what you would expect when you are on a time crunch and courses were served on time without us feeling rushed. The food on the other hand was nothing to write home about.   Appetizer -Albacore tuna crudo with leeks, ponzu sauce and tapioca pearls The tuna was not marinated properly and it was just sitting on a bed of ponzu sauce which was way too overpowering.   Main - Hand rolled spinach fettucine with jumbo tiger shrimp, chili, fennel, white wine butter sauce and balsamic drizzle The jumbo shrimp did not have any flavor or seasoning. The dish had a one dimensional note to it and got boring very quickly. The pasta was well cooked though.  Dessert - House made almond milk tofu with fresh berries, lemon sorbet and mint  Worst dessert I've had in a long time. The almond milk tofu was weird tasting almost gritty to some extent. The only saving grace was the lemon sorbet which was refreshing on a hot summer day  Somehow, I don't feel like this is worth a second try. The ingredients look appealing but the execution seems lacking and the end product is not harmonious. Avoid this place if you can and give your taste buds something else to be excited about !!!"}
{"text":"Chef Scot Woods has left. The tasting menu is gone. The wine prices have gone up significantly. They charge just to have bread on your table. And unless you enjoy uncooked ground meat and boiled, unpeeled tongue, I suggest you steer as far clear of this place as possible from now on. What a shame."}
{"text":"This is a disturbingly wonderful restaurant. We walked into a full house on a Tuesday night and were seated in the one vacant 2-top within a minute or two. Winterlicious, so there is a prix fixe menu, and within a minute or two, indecisive me had picked out my first (cauliflower soup with caviar, tobiko, edamame, wasabe), main (boeuf bourguignon with beef 'bacon' (smoked brisket) and various root vegetable mash) and dessert (artfully deconstructed lemon meringue pie). The first wine-by-the-glass was good, the second was awesome. The whiskey suggestion from our server was absurdly good. Asked the server about the coffee and he knew the answers (which never happens). Okay, the beverages cost almost 2x the dinner, but still! How often do you get a perfect meal?"}
{"text":"With the generally positive reviews I was expecting a good experience, but this was a great experience.  A new favourite for me in the city.  Room: has a great urban sophisticated feel without any pretense, and when full is still quiet enough to enjoy conversation.    Service: Friendly, efficient, with only minor affectation  Menu: Just about the perfect length, several interesting options, focus on Canadian themed ingredients, with intriguing accompaniments, like paneer with the lamb   Presentation: Elegant and inventive, yet not fussy  Taste:  The style is 'New American', so flavors are combined from different cuisines, and in this case quite skilfully, the overall effect being complementary, intense, and clean.    Healthiness: Pretty good, oils kept in check, focus on quality fresh ingredients   Value: It's a wallet-thumper alright, but Lucien delivers on the price."}
{"text":"I suggested to one of my best friends that she join me for lunch at Lucien. I had heard many great things about this restaurant and in particular, I heard that they had a great Summerlicious menu.   I got there before my friend so I was seated first. We were given a table in the back, so that was nice and cozy.   The beginning of our meal started well enough. The waiter who took our order was very enthusiastic and very nice.   Our order: Starters Bread (extra $2)  Smoked chicken salad with organic greens, heirloom radish and buttermilk ranch dressing (local)---tasted like tuna not chicken. It was okay. Nothing special. I was warned that it would be spicy, but I did not think it was. But I like my food spicy.   Albacore tuna crudo with leeks, ponzu sauce and tapioca pearls--tasted like sashimi. I guess that is the point. I like sashimi, and so does my friend, so we both liked it.   Overall the appetizers were ok. Not great, but not bad. Meh.   Mains:  It took over 30 minutes for us to get our mains. Everyone around us was being served except for us. The waiter did keep apologizing, but it was not him that was actually serving us the food. Eventually he went and got our plates.   Hand rolled spinach fettucine with jumbo tiger shrimp, chili, fennel, white wine butter sauce and balsamic drizzle---loved the past and shrimps. There were a lot of little pieces of other vegetables throughout the pasta. Some fennel and something else. It did not need it. I also did not taste any chili, but again, I like my food spicy.   Pan roasted Perth County pork with confit of heirloom tomatoes and cilantro dressing (local)--it did not look that great to me, but my friend liked it. She specially liked how the vegetables were cooked.   Desserts:  Cherries jubilee, vanilla ice cream, cream soda (local)--bread was dry. Nothing special about it.  A friend had told me that they had great vanilla ice cream, hence the reason I ordered this dessert. But I did not find anything special about the ice cream either.   House made almond milk tofu with fresh berries, lemon sorbet and mint (local)---my friend likes tofu so she enjoyed it. I thought it tasted too much like tofu. Mmm I guess that was the point?  Verdict: I went for lunch to Canoe the day before and I guess that experience really had a great influence on this one. The lunch at Canoe was $25 and the food was amazing, the service impeccable, and the ambiance relaxing. Here at Lucien, the lunch was $20 and even though it was a great deal, it did not feel like it to me. Definitely have no plans of returning."}
{"text":"Hubby and myself had reservations here for a romantic Valentine's meal this past February.  The venue was fitting as Lucien's interior is stunningly outftted with Art Nouveau flourishes abound.  Lots of wrought iron scrolling and stained glass with sprinklings of Toulouse-Lautrec prints for good measure.  Our server was neither callous nor too obliging just neutrally efficient and informative. Maybe it was the dining choices hubby and myself sampled at Lucien, however I was pretty underwhelmed with my meal.   We started with the Bincho Grilled octopus and hubby had the Berkshire pork belly.  Our mains were the roast Fenwood farms chicken and Ontario veal Ribeye. To finish we sampled the \"Chocolate Complex\" and hubby chased his meal with a single malt Oban.  Overall flavour and texture wise, I wasn't feeling it at all. Hubby expressed his dinner was good but what man is ever unsatisfied when ribs are involved?  I felt like the meals were more like minimalist works of interpretive masticative art than satisfying gourmand dining.  Call me a purist but I prefer that foodstuffs like octopus are served up looking like octopus and not as some odd terrine-like concotion, not to mention the \"dessert\" of some scant chocolate pieces with salt and spices made me feel I was surrendering to some culinary experiment just to make Lucien laugh at my expense for both my idiocy for ordering it  and for charging me $16.   I've had the honour and pleasure for the past 20 years to dine on some wonderful, flavourful, and utterly orgasmic meals at both lowbrow and highbrow establishments in Toronto. Lucien to me felt like an insolent exercise in posturing and bravado. Instead of provoking gastronomic inspiration in me, Lucien left a bad taste in my mouth and less $225 from my husband's well intentioned pocket.  Lucien, I will give you credit for trying to assert your own brand of avant garde cuisine but quite frankly, I'd leave the molecular freestyling to Ferran Adria and his rogue El Bulli disciples."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Attentive service and delicious food, but I'm not sure I experienced the same \"WOW\" or \"MEH\" factor that others have.  Listen, this place is good, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to others, but it's also not amazing or paradigm-shifting by any means. Judging by the the \"bimodal\" distribution of Yelp ratings, however, it seems like you're either a fanboy or a hater.   To the FANBOYS: The service and food were good, but not amaze-balls. My favourite was their unique take on the classic french onion soup - excellent presentation, loved the duck , though would've preferred a bit more cheese. Their heirloom tomato salad could've, again, had more than just a thin slice of barrata. Cod was done well and the deer was cooked to medium-rare perfection (though I prefer a gamier taste, that's just me). And as for the apple confit, the highlight was actually the goat cheese ice cream that accompanied it.  To the HATERS: To those expecting Lucien to be a molecular gastronomic affair comparable to El Bulli, I say, \"WTF?! Seriously?\" This place is far from it, but last I checked, they weren't advertising themselves as such. A lot of detractors also complain about the price/serving size ratio. On the one hand, I tend to agree if only because I've eaten at other comparably good restaurants for less but it's not like Lucien's prices are outrageously expensive (although I wasn't exactly rushing to order their chef's tasting menu!). On the other hand, given how everything else in the neighbourhood is in the same price range and there's this thing called the Internets, I'm not sure how the cost was beyond people's expectations.  All in all, I like Lucien and that's why it deserves 3 stars. Apparently, I'm only the second or third out of 30 people to think so."}
{"text":"Lucien is a tasty upscale restaurant located in the old Pravda building and although I thought the space was nice and intimate, in many ways I felt they missed the mark.   THE AMBIANCE/SERVICE:  Despite the space's romantic and intimate feel, the ambiance felt quite stuffy and I got the impression I did not belong. I found it funny that despite other open seats we were sat next to the only visible minority couple in the middle of the restaurant. Patrons would often stare in our direction and quickly turn away when we caught their eye... I felt like I was in a zoo and sort of uncomfortable.Our waitress on the other hand was generally nice and attentive during our meal.  THE FOOD:  First there is the menu. I had previously brought my bf to Black Hoof for what I would credit as one of the most interesting gastronomic experience we've ever had. When a Groupon for this place came up a few weeks ago I quickly snatched one up when I saw their online menu. With mentions of foie gras ice cream I had high expectation for creative and tasty food.   When we looked at the menu, it seemed completely different from the one online (this has since been updated online). A little bummed out that I wouldn't be eating crazy ice cream I ordered the red leaf and bib salad and my bf got the slow cooked pork tongue. Both were quite good but I'd say the tongue was a better value as both aps cost $12 each.  For the main, I got the Black Angus ribeye and bone marrow. The steak was great but the bone marrow arrived on its own with no accompaniments. For those of you unfamiliar with bone marrow it's extremely rich... almost like eating butter or lard and is best served with  bread or salt in order to balance the texture.  We ordered a bottle of wine for $40 and a basket of bread. The total came to $170 including tax but excluding tip. The food was good but nothing wowed me except the price tag."}
{"text":"From:  - Friend -  Subject:  we got served by Lucien owner Simon Bower!!  Date:  May 1, 2011 3:27:27 AM EDT  To:  - Me -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKq4C-G6Nqw  no wonder service was impeccable, lol!  ---  Service was exceptional! Probably because of above.  I would recommend the flan and cheese cake. Had the black cod for entree, which was nice, friend thought it was outstanding. And overall very pleasant experience.  Note to self: Next time I must try the octopus appetizer."}
{"text":"Lucien is as perfect a small, intimate wine bar restaurant as can be found ANYWHERE. Located really conveniently close to work, culture, sports and the King St subway. The decor is lovely, especially the enormous  mirror behind the bar. Very classy. Food is creative yet accessible for everyone's tastes. The proprietor, Simon Bower, expertly guided our decisions on what we would like best. Service is polite yet, friendly and casual. Delivery of drinks and dishes moves at the perfect pace. What more can I say! Put Lucien on your \"go-to\" list for after work, before theatre, sports or just a dinner out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What started off as what could have been a bad dining experience was quickly turned around. Simon, the owner, did recognize that we were waiting a long time for our table...and then when seated, we were asked to move to the back of the restaurant. It wasn't a great start to our experience...  To make up for it, we received complimentary glasses of champagne for our hassle (usually $20/glass). The hassle wasn't anything a little alcohol couldn't fix - and bubbly at that!  Our first course was cauliflower soup with caviar, smoked salmon and edamame (sp?). Simply amazing - I have never taken so long to saviour a soup in my life. We also let our server choose the appropriate wine pairings, which were def. on point.  Another minor hiccup - barely before I could finish the soup the main was out on the table. I politely requested to the server to make sure there is a little more time between the main and dessert. He recognized what I was getting at - and gave us our main course wine pairings on the house. They may not have got it right, but they did their best to rectify the situation. The main was an organic salmon with a variety of root veg puree (mostly varieties of beets). It was amazing. The salmon was perfectly cooked. I am guessing they seared it on the skin side, and then put the cast iron skillet in the over (not sure though).   Dessert was a wonder lemon meringue pie with graham crackers and ice cream. I'm not typically a sweet tooth person - but this was an excellent balance of not being too sweet.  Final verdict - I had been here once before and was even more impressed (I did winterlicious this time, so you gotta account for that). This is the BEST restaurant I have been to in our fine city. Love it, and will definitely being going there again for special dinner occassions."}
{"text":"On a quiet, cold Sunday night, I stopped in to Lucien, which is in a gorgeous restored building. The room was mostly empty, and the reception was cordial and immediate. But let's cut to the chase.  While the appetizer of heirloom beets and carrots was fresh and presented as a true work of art, it wasn't overly exciting. The venison was cooked perfectly, but who really needs the foam that swamped a good portion of the plate? So why go back to this high-end restaurant? Because in fact it has the best lemon meringue \"pie\" anywhere in North America. The consistency, the pungent lemon tang, along with the homemade ice cream and cocoa covered meringue are in a league of their own.  So while you might find the appetizers and food elsewhere, you won't find the lemon meringue anywhere else. And that's worth the trip!"}
