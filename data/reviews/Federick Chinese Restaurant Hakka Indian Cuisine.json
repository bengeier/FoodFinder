{"text":"not in the greatest area but pretty decent hakka food.. halal meat is served, they do not serve pork. hard to find halal sweet and sour chicken balls... I liked it...I like it better than Eddies..."}
{"text":"Try the chicken pakora. The portions are good and if you pay cash you get 10% off. Food tastes the same as the Scarborough and Markham locations but I think they are not officially related. The lady at the front is nice. Food is oily but I mainly order fried food so can't really complain."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent food. We went on saturday the 7th for lunch , mostly enjoyed the food, Hakka  noodles was delicious with sufficent shrimp chicken and much appreciated bean sprout.  The black bean beaf was very good, the garlic chicken and chicken pakora average. Overall enjoyed our meal and went back on saturday the 14th for dinner, and I do not think will go back again.  The hakka noodles was terrible. The noodles was under cooked hardly any chicken shrimp or bean sprout. It was inedible.  Black bean beaf was good. But crispy beaf was a disaster. 
Had to send it back since meat and sauce was served separately. The sauce had a bad aftertaste. 
I have never been to a place with worse service. The gentleman who took our order was very nice, but the two waitresses had  major attitude, they refused to make eye contact, in case we ask them for something. And not a smile on there faces . Overall a below average experience."}
{"text":"I felt the food WAS GREAT, but had lots of salt or MSG. I couldn't stop drinking water for the rest of the night. The other hakka chinese places don't leave me feeling like this. The prices are portions are amazing, compared to other Mississauga hakka places.

The servers are very friendly and ambiance, lovely! Despite the extra salt/MSG, I would go back."}
{"text":"This place certainly deserves a better rating. The chicken pakora is delicious ! So is the hakka fried noodle and the chilli fish! 
The food is better than the average Chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Chicken Pakoras and fried rice! Have also tried the Cashew chicken and that is also yummy! For the longest time we used to drive all the way to Scarborough which is the first location and we're extremely happy when they opened the branch in Mississauga! The people working there are amazing especially Agnes and William, those two are great, and almost always there! Lillian ive only met once but she is awesome! all three are very good friendly and helpful people, and if William is the one cooking your food, you know it's going to be great ;)

Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"The most rude and abusive service I've ever received in my life. Me and my dad went there to order some chili chicken, and the owner of the store was showing a nonstop attitude the whole time. I asked for an extra plate so me and my dad can split the meal, but they charged me EXTRA for an empty plate. Yes, you read that correctly. On top of that, I asked for some hot sauce and they told me to go get it myself from another table. I later politely asked them why they were treating me rudely, but they refused to give me a reason and they told me that they don't want my business anymore. I am never eating at such a place which does not know how to treat customers with basic human decency, and I highly advise others to ditch them as well."}
{"text":"I had the General Tao Chicken lunch special for around $6 bucks and it was awesome. Fast and friendly take out service."}
{"text":"Pros: decent wait time, portions and customer service for takeout 
Cons: food is not worth spending money on. Ordered chilli paneer (dry) and chilli chicken (dry) and hands down, this is the worse Hakka food I've ever had! Chilli paneer was hard, fried pieces of paneer with no gravy coating it as per the norm. This place should be embarrassed to be serving food as bad as this."}
{"text":"I went there food was delicious. ... stuff was friendly and this is also good like the markham and scarborough location same taste same food :) it's a family owned business and their food quality is always on point. So if you have cravings for Hakka Chinese food this is the spot. They have a very good lunch menu too ."}
{"text":"Again, carrying and continuing the tradition of terrible, stale, old, left over hakka food, Federick's opens up another at MIssissauga.

People, don't waste your time at any  Federick's.  Terrible terrible stale old, left over hakka - even if you go at dinner and order the full orders (no the specials or lunch specials, but the full price orders), THE FOODS STILL TASTED LIKE CRAP!
The service is aweful and the prices shold be cut in half for the over all quality of Federick's.

Hey, if you're in the MIssissauga area and feel like spicy chicken, then you should go to any Wendy's before considering Federick's. I think Cosco would be a better place to eat.

The dumbest thing is, the owners of Federick's DO NOT take ANY accountability for their service and food.

BE WARNED."}
{"text":"This was an impromptu visit to this location. Having heard rave reviews about their locations once we saw this spot we decided to eat here instead of the regular BBQ take out place nearby. 
For the three of us we ordered these
Chicken chowmein. Greasy as expected. Not much above court level IMO. 
Sweet and sour chicken. Ok I guess as am not a big fan of this dish anyway. Lots of batter and little chicken in the center. Sauce is ok. 
Chicken Manchurian. This is considered a yardstick for Hakka style Chinese in the sub continent. Hmm a very average offering. Didn't have the ketchup taste one associates nor the sweet spicy taste profiles. 
They are priced at food court levels so I guess that level of food can be justified. I don't think I will revisit."}
{"text":"Overall as very disappointing experience. I used to love fredricks in Scarborough back in the day. 
Service:ok
Food: extremely disappointing. 
Chilli chicken: no taste
Garlic prawn: soaked in oil and sauce that has everything but garlic
Green beans: it was stale

Overall I wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"I am a whole fan of hakka Indian Cuisine, however this had to be the worse hakka restaurant i been too. Upon arriving at this restaurant we placed our order and had to wait over 1hr for our food to arrive. The funny thing was we only ordered a total of 3 dishes. Once we got our food, it tasted like it had been reheat. my General Tao Chicken was extremely chewy and under cooked. Honestly i have nothing enough to say about this restaurant the pricing was cheap, which is shown through the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I am surprised that so far I haven't reviewed this restaurant as of yet. We have eaten inside at least twice, have taken a few takeaways and even did a partial party catering. So, even before I start one can guess, we like this place. 

The owner (guy) is friendly, warm and provides excellent service. He will make sure you are satisfied with your order. The food competitively priced and is of fairly good quality and the perhaps the best part, the portions are on the higher side compared to others. 

Today for lunch, between the three of us we ordered a Paneer Chili, a Ma Po Tofu and Manchurian Vegetable Chow Mein and we got two plain Steamed Rice with the order. All this for just over $25 including taxes (tips not including). 

The Paneer Chili was enjoyed by the rest of the family and kept on going for seconds. The Noodles, were spiced alright and had a few vegetables and perhaps the colour seemed to red/orange for me. The taste was good. The Tofu is perfect for someone who can't handle spices. Delicately spiced and had lots of peas and carrots. The peas for some reason had a crunch to it. In my previous visit we have noticed the same in Fried Rice and Vegetarian Manchurian as well. The steamed rice was just too much for us to finish. In fact we had left over for all the other dishes as well."}
{"text":"Brand new Hakka restaurant that opened up just south of Dundas on Hurontario.  Based on the rave reviews of Federick in Markham and Scarborough, I figured I had to visit this place considering it's only 5 minutes south of where I live.  

I'm gonna get straight to the main point here.

FOOD: I'm not the biggest fan of Hakka so I ordered something slightly different which was the veggie ma po tofu and Singapore fried rice.  The ma po tofu was good and the tofu was fresh and nice and silky, which is my fave type.  I quite enjoyed this dish.  As for the Singapore fried rice, it was basically like Singapore vermicelli but with rice.  It wasn't amazing, but it was adequate.  So I would say the food taste is around 3/5, however the prices are insanely cheap. The ma po tofu was only $6.50 and was huge, BUT included a huge bowl of rice too!  Also, the Singapore fried rice was only $7.00.  See pic - huge portion again. So I'm gonna add 0.5 stars for portion size. 3.5/5

Atmosphere: While I didn't eat in, it's very nicely decorated and while the outside is a bit run down (by no fault of theirs - just the area), you don't even feel like you are in a run down area.  Very calming.  4/5

Service: can't comment on as  I did not eat in. N/A.  

Verdict: Pretty decent Hakka place. 
--------------------
Note 1: This is the same as the Markham/Scarborough location, but the brother (who used to be the head chef) runs this location and the sisters run the other locations.

Note 2: They have super cheap lunch specials for around $5-$6

Note 3: Only accept debit over $10 and VISA/MC over $25."}
{"text":"Went back, as I needed a Hakka fix...  Was desperate!  Called Federicks.

Even though they are a part of the Federicks chain - the food doesnt taste anything like the other locations.

Portions were pretty good (like everywhere else) but the food is still mediocre.  Maybe Send the chefs to Markham and Scarborough for some training and the food will be bang on!"}
{"text":"The food deserves no stars to be honest. We only ordered vegetarian food - veggie manchurian and veggie chilli paneer with noodles and rice. it was so bad - goopy - full of corn starch and no resemblance of an actual sauce. The sodium in the food will give you high blood pressure after one serving. Don't go here. Save your money and go somewhere else where you can get better food and not have a bad culinary experience. I did not experience sit down service since we picked up the food. The lady on the phone was her usual rude self which I always expect when calling these places. Good luck (not eating here)."}
{"text":"Thoroughly satisfied with my visit. Food was good, portions were large and the service was quick and friendly. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband really likes Lin Garden so I suggested that he try Federick because I used to go to the Scarborough location back in the late-90s and I really enjoyed the food; it was pretty popular back then and I think it still sees a lot of business to this day.  I also knew that one of the chefs from the Scarborough location opened Lin Garden. 

Anyway, we went on the website and chose four dishes: crispy beef, chili chicken, salt and pepper squid and Manchurian mixed noodles.  When I called to place the order, the woman that answered immediately asked for a \"number\", so I started to provide my telephone number but, after asking her a few times to clarify, she had wanted the menu item number, which wasn't on the website.  She seemed a bit annoyed but told me just to go ahead and order and she'll \"figure it out\".   I went ahead and gave her the order and asked if I could make a small substitution - the answer: \"NO YOU CANNOT.\"  I asked if one of the dishes could be spicy, \"NO IT CANNOT!\"  She was just so discourteous that I just said I'd call back.  I sincerely apologize to all Mississauga residents but I'm beginning to question if being on the impolite side to customers is just the culture out there.  Like you're a new restaurant, make an effort to provide some decent customer service.

I told my husband about the bad attitude but he said, since he had to go out that way anyway, he'd just pop in and check it out and, if she was still rude, he'd just go to another restaurant.  Personally, I didn't want to give them the business and I was getting a bad feeling that the food wouldn't be good either.  

Well he went in and she was pretty short with him and the other customers but he said the place was kind of busy so he'd decided to give it a try.  During his 30-minute wait, a loud argument ensued between the chef and another worker - so loud that it was heard by all the patrons and they made no effort to calm it down.  Nice ...

Anyway, here's the verdict on the food:

Crispy beef: the beef was coated with a fish and chip type batter with sauce on the side; looked and tasted gross.

Chili chicken: huge, sloppy chunks of chicken lacking sauce, heat and flavor - looked like it was just cut-up fast and cooked in five minutes.

Salt and pepper squid: very good - squid was cooked just right and good size portion.

Manchurian mixed noodles: cooked al dente, not greasy but, honestly, not a ton of flavor. 

Very little hot sauce and green chilies were provided; also, no napkins or cutlery.

Bottom line: not a great experience and the food looked like it was prepared from a fast food joint with no pride put into it - just kind of \"thrown\" into the containers.  I would have given it two stars but, because of the poor customer service, I have to deduct a star.  Final verdict: 1/5.

If you like Hakka food and you're sort of around that Etobicoke/ Mississauga border, just go to Everest on Lake Shore - the food is excellent and the owners are soooo incredibly nice and really appreciate the business (see my review)."}
{"text":"When I tried this branch soon after it opened, the food did not taste like their Scarborough branches tried a couple of times, but always ended up with feeling unfulfilled. So we ended up ditching this branch and heading to Scarborough (45 minutes away). However, over the last few months the food quality seems to have gotten better. It seems much on par with the Scarborough branch."}
{"text":"This is the best Hakka Chinese available in GTA
Tried chilli beef, mix veg noodles and hot and sour soup 
The soup was good noodles okay could do with more greens added
The beef chilli was excellent The best I ever had
With the right flavours and cooked to perfection 
The service was the worst
The lady at the counter was irritated and on the edge 
I liked the food so much and wanted to get it catered for an event but she was shouting and speaking to almost everyone there
Asked her for the catering menu 3 to 4 times she just didn't listen or pay attention 
Yes will go there for the food and try out more 
A must must try for the food"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place unless you are starving with $8 in your pocket and no other place is open within 20km radius.  

What they call mapo tofu is MSG-drenched motor oil with sour-tasting bean curd.  You can't tell if chicken dish was assembled with leftover pork parts. And just don't try anything that has word Szechuan in it.  For a self-respecting Asian foodie, this place is a disgrace."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of four. Ordered the boneless chilli chicken, Manchurian eggplant and chop suey vegetarian. There was plenty of seating, the service was great and food came out fairly quickly. The portion sizes as expected were very generous and saucy. We had asked for the dishes to be spicy but we still found it fairly mild as far as Hakka food goes. With respect to the meal, it was pretty filling and decent but nothing mind blowing. It was very very saucy which is nice if you are into that kind of dish. I've been told the shrimp wantons are very good but didn't get a chance to try it myself this time - so if I come back I would try that."}
{"text":"Love this place!

I've been to going to Federicks in both Scarborough and their newer location in Markham and I'm pretty ecstatic they've opened up a new location in Mississauga!

My staple order:

1.  Chilli Chicken
2.  Chicken Pakora
3.  Yu Sheun Eggplant

Service:  
The staff was a bit slow to start off but I think they found their way and service has been a lot faster for me  especially for take out orders.

The lady at the front can be a bit stressed when things get busy but she is super friendly.

The food:
Fantastic food that is consistent every time.  

Halal friendly.

Portions are great and the white rice is included with each dish :)

If I keep adding more compliments you'll think I work here so I'll just keep end this now.

Awesome restaurant and best Hakka in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Huge portions !! The bag was quite heavy for manchurian chowmein and schezwan chicken , was confused as if order was misplaced ! 
But finally when we reached Home n found it was the correct order with such huge portions ! And being indian I prefer spicy food.. I asked the food to be more spicy and yes it was indeed! Yummmmy spicy n tasty food"}
{"text":"I wish there were zero starts available. The food was terrible and the service is just as bad. Took us 45 minutes to get our food for a group of 7 people, only couple of others in the restaurant. Chilly chicken i got was so salty i still feel sick from it as i am writing this hours later. Girlfriend got shrimp with tomatoes... there was no tomato in sight on her plate. One of the worst hakka places i have ever been to. They forgot some of our drinks and had to review the order 5 different times. Just a nightmare, never again.
I would sooner watch sharknado while getting my genitals stomped then eat at that place again."}
{"text":"We ordered food an hour ago for takeout amd we r still waiting...its been an hour. Yes they advised that there would be a wait but AN HOUR??? I think Stephen Harper is comin through. Food is goood!"}
{"text":"Tonight we tried crispy beef but the food so bland , no taste what so ever. 
We had to put spice sauce but still no good. We'll maybe we should give try the other menu...think positive"}
