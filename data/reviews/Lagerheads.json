{"text":"We went with a large group of 11 people at 3:30 pm on a Saturday.  I was very, very impressed with the food, beer, and the great service.  I would highly recommend Lagerheads and look forward to a return trip."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a fresh beer!  This place always has something different that I like to try.  Today I had the High Five American IPA.  Not too hoppy, nice citrus notes and smooth finish.    Great with BBQ!  For dinner I always get their 1/2 and 1/2 combo with chicken and switch between the brisket and ribs but today it's the pulled pork.  If you like smoked meats and a lot of it, this place is for you!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Lagerheads this afternoon with a group of 7. We ordered both food and drink, and I walked away fairly disappointed after having this place talked up

They had the following Lagerhead-brewed beers on tap (I don't remember all of the names, but will include what I do remember): 

  * Barnburner lager: listed as a golden lager, but clearly an amber lager. This beer was well out of style for something labeled \"golden\", but it was drinkable. I just think they should list this as what it is, pretty much a Vienna lager. And if this was labeled Vienna lager, I think it would be better served with some melanoidin malt because it comes off as lacking complexity.
  * Oktoberfest: probably the most to-style beer they had, very drinkable, low bitterness, and a nice, mild floral hop character.
  * Bed head red ale: no one had this, so I can't comment.
  * A tripel that I don't remember the name of, but no one had it, so again, I can't comment.
  * A barleywine: this barleywine was big, but not too alcoholic. However, it was fairly heavy-handed with the crystal malt. Barleywine as a style should really let the base malt come through (which is why for English styles you often see the use of Golden Promise or Maris Otter). One may certainly add character with some crystal malt, but in this case the SRM was in the mid- to high-20s, making this beer very cloying.
  * High five IPA: again, not too bad of a beer, but way overdone with the crystal malt. Very American character, with citrusy hops (probably Columbus and Centennial, maybe some Chinook, doubt there was Simcoe or Amarillo), but I thought the hop aroma and flavor could have been higher by using more late hop additions. The bitterness was nice for the rather high alcohol level for the style, 7.5%. This beer to me just had too much caramel character for an IPA, which should be drier to let the hop bitterness have more of a role.

Given the beer only, I would have given this joint three stars, but the food that was ordered on my tab was pathetic. I ordered the ahi tuna dinner, but the tuna came out way overcooked, my salad was pretty pedestrian due primarily to the choice of iceberg lettuce which sucks compared to romaine, and a small side of baked beans, which was reasonably tasty. My girlfriend's chicken sandwich was undercooked, and the cheese on it seemed to be fairly low-quality.

And I forgot to mention the service was fairly mediocre.

All the way around, I think this place could use an overhaul. They seem to be trying to do things on the cheap; maybe that will work for a while, but eventually it catches up with you."}
{"text":"Great lunch.
Served quickly and a simple menue.
Fantastic brisket melt. Slightly more melted cheese sauce than if they used slices. Salad was just iceberg with cukes and tomatoes. 
Place needs more than one handicapped parking spot.
Like the meat! A lot!
Will be back"}
{"text":"Found out about this place a few years ago and wish I found it sooner.  Best BBQ around!  A few unique items on the menu also to compliment standard BBQ fare.  Wings are a must try for anyone. Service is good as I would expect for a smaller establishment.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The beer is fantastic especially the Bed Head Red. Some of the best barbecue I've found in NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"Simply said great food great people great beer what else is there.
If you're going for the first time I would recommend starting out with the sampler platter can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Service could be a little faster, but the food is worth the small wait.  Sauce is sweet and compliments the pulled pork amazingly well.  The whole family cleaned their plates."}
{"text":"Got some beers and dinner after golf. High five ipa, good stuff, Cuban sandwich, fantastic stuff. Sandwich was awesome. Pork was great, pickles were great, bread was great. Nice crunch. I think I got the remnants on the chips, but were good too. 

Great place for beer and BBQ. Will always go back."}
{"text":"This time when we were here the server forgot my beer and then served up some average fair.  I should point out that I was in here once a few weeks earlier when they goofed up two entries in a row (they weren't even edible) so I was mildly biased since I was looking for a repeat of that first time we went when this place knocked it out of the park.  If I had to guess, success has made them complacent.

However the pork rinds? Yum, almost worth five stars by themselves, but certainly worth at least three."}
{"text":"Good food....good atmosphere. We ride to this destination in the summer and hang out. Staff is always friendly and nice. Recomended."}
{"text":"My apologies to all of the fans of this place, but my experience was really bad.  We visited with our family a few weeks ago and the food was definitely the low-point.  The ribs were on special, so I went for a full-rack of baby backs.  My wife went for the pulled pork sandwich.  My ribs arrived with a thick layer of sauce burned onto the outside of the ribs, giving them a thick armor of burnt sauce.  Is it normal in this area to burn the sauce onto the meat?  It is a shame because what meat there was under the \"sauce armor\" was well-smoked.  The other problem with the ribs was that they were really fatty.  I understand that a certain level of fat makes the ribs juicy, but the amount of fat on this slab was unlike anything I have ever seen.  It just seemed like they were using really low-quality ingredients.  I thought they may have received a bad shipment of product, then I tried my wife's pulled pork.  Same issue...big chunks of fat mixed into the meat.  It made it really hard to eat and enjoy.  the pork was also unseasoned and had no taste at all.  I guess they plan on everyone adding a ton of sauce.  On the good side, they get a 2nd star from me for service.  Our waitress was attentive and took good care of our group of nine people.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great NC BBQ that I enjoy at home, but I can't recommend Lagerheads."}
{"text":"If you are a true fan of BBQ then this is the place for you.  I eat here quite often and I think the wings and spectacular,  unlike any around here due to the fact they are smoked in there own on location smoker.   When trying to eat healthy my wife always gets the \"Flying Hawaiian\" chicken sandwich.  She raves about the sauce on it.  The Briskett is tender and very flavorful definitely the best I have had.  The staff is the best part. Every waitress is friendly and very attentive.  I always feel I get my money's worth and recommend Lagerheads to anybody. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food and the perfect atmosphere for a bar. The bartenders and servers are all the best! This is my favorite place in the world to have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Visited with the family and really enjoyed our meals. We started with the Nachos that we all agreed were the best we ever had. The southern style brisket was excellent. Very good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here I have been disappointed. I don't know if it is just the style of food or if I'm not alone. I go, I order chicken wings because everyone tells me how great they are and they just taste like burnt chicken with no seasoning or flavor, just plain burnt chicken.  So if you're not into what people keep telling me is \"great BBQ\" I would not go here. I am not and was not impressed."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night.  The waitress was very prompt and attentive. We had good barbecue with chicken wings, pulled pork, and the ribs being our favorites. The winter warmer on tap was good as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great micro brews! 
Love the bourbon barrel stout.  CO2 based instead of nitrogen. 
Loaded fries are awesome. 
Also had a great southwestern burger.   Cooled to perfection and BBQ sauce is homemade and fantastic. 
Cute waitresses too!"}
{"text":"We eat here regularly. Great food, great beer and the staff is always friendly. Our favorites are the chicken wings and the ribs and the side dishes are amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place many times and really just thought it was a biker bar, probably because I would only pass by there in the summertime when I would travel out to my camper and there were always motorcycles out front.  Anyway, I met the owners not too long ago at another event and tried some of their beer. By far the tripel was the best one that I had out of the 6 that they do have. I was very impressed by their beer and had heard rumors about the place and assigned myself the task of making sure I went there. As I walked in it felt exactly like a BBQ joint should feel like. Warm colors and decor, tv's, beer memorabilia, etc. It was not very busy, in fact it was close to closing time but I managed to get in my food order before the kitchen closed. I ordered the Rib appetizer, Spicy Garlic wings and Pork Skins. I also ordered the Tripel because I couldn't wait to try it again. Again it did not disappoint. My food arrived timely and the presentation was good. I enjoyed the ribs first as they looked delicious and they were in fact very good in taste and probably are as good as you are going to get anywhere. After the ribs I went into the Wings and at this time I ordered their American Pale Ale of which I was surprised was served in a chilled pint glass. Pale ales typically compliment spicy foods and I was looking forward to the pairing but I had to work for this one because pale ales are best when not served in chilled glasses as it takes away from the taste of the beer. So I asked for a warm glass to pour my APA in and commenced eating. The wings were whole wings instead of drums and flats separated which was fine with me and well worth the effort to eat. Overall the wings were very good and I look forward to trying their other sauces. Finally the pork rinds served with a side of hot sauce, still crackling when they hit the counter were amazing. A great touch to a bar menu. I do plan on going back and probably more often now that I have broken the ice. One fear I do have though is having to sit in the bar because the high ceiling causes the room to be very loud. There were a group of regulars there, around 8 of them and just me and it was annoyingly loud. I would hate to see how it is with more people seated at the tables and business booming. Overall a completely enjoyable visit but maybe throw up some cloth flags or banners in the middle of the bar to deflect sound and serve beers in the correct temperature of glassware."}
{"text":"Lagerheads has the best BBQ around.  Get the smokehouse sampler.  Great value.  Brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and wings.  Comes with two sides.  For $17.99 it was more than enough for two.  Lagerheads is also a microbrewery and offers 5 microbrews.  Tried 2 and they were great as well.  Service was outstanding.  I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Me and the girlfriend checked this place out last night. OMG... SO GOOD!! I had a Pepsi , it was tasty ;) but the RIBS are freakin AWESOME! Rubbed,smoked, and charred . With it we had onion rings and a salad. Both were good. We will be back soon to try all of the other meat choices... :) :) Oh, we sat at the bar, sevicebwas great. Very friendly people."}
{"text":"Knocking off a couple stars. Tonight we went in and my wife ordered a \"bowl\" of beer cheese soup. What was delivered was 4oz - maybe 6oz - of soup in a bowl that probably could have held 16oz. She dipped the spoon straight in and only got maybe a half inch of depth. It was comical. When we asked our server, she said \"one ladle is standard.\" It really was comical compared to the sandwiches ordered by other people at the table. It used to be a full bowl when we last ordered it a year ago. Lame."}
{"text":"Some of the best smoked BBQ in the north.  Great craft beers as well.  Moderately priced but smoking takes time and money so I get it.  My family of 6 can eat and drink for under $80 which is about standard at the chains.  The service is strong and the atmosphere is down home country."}
{"text":"Service was great although they were busy. Apps were really good. I had bbq wings, hubby had burger. Both were really good. Didn't try the beer but heard it was also really good and brewed on site."}
{"text":"I just came back from a short trip to Ohio and was pleasantly suprised when we were introduced to this restaurant for lunch.  The menu was typical barbeque and bar food...but that is exactly what I wanted.  We stared off with a couple appetizers, including their Rib Teaser and Beer Battered Onion Rings.  Both were delicious.  The Ribs had a nice Char on them and the Barbeque sauce was very tasty.

We ordered their Big Butt Sandwich (pulled pork), Rib dinners and Black and Blue Burger. ALL were exceptional.  We enjoyed some of their home brews. They had quite a selection so we ordered a Flight of beers to sample 6 of them. Quite a variety of flavors and over all great products.

Service and Quality of food was excellent.  So good that we ended up eating there for dinner the next night.  Enjoyed their Fish Fry dinner and Pork Rinds for an appetizer. (those were excellent...not something you can find in every restaurant.

Great to see a local business thriving in literally the middle of two corn fields.  I would highly recommend it for all.  Don't let the \"Barn style\" building keep you away.  Give it a try...I am confident you will be pleasantly suprised as well."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites to visit,  but last night, I did have a meal that was not up to par. I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich. I didn't realize the one I ordered had cole slaw on it (my fault totally), but I like cole slaw so it wasn't a big problem. I don't like sloppy sandwiches so I decided to eat it with a fork. The problem was with the lack of actual meat. Most of it was fat.  so I ended up only eating maybe 1/4 of my meal. Love beef & pork...hate fat! I have had several different meals here and this definitely won't stop me from coming back because they do BBQ right. But to the person prepping those sandwiches, come on man. Who wants a sandwich of fat? Really?!! You owe your employer to do your job and ensure what you are sending out to serve someone is up to par. That's why restaurants get bad reviews and lose business. Mgmt, don't lower your standards. I want to continue to patronize your restaurant,  but I expect better in a meal. I'll be back again...I hope the problem gets corrected so we don't have to find another place to go."}
{"text":"I'd like to write a review, but...
I'm in Medina for business on Monday, get in on Sunday, want a beer and some hockey. Evidently the Puritans of Local Government need to foist their morality on everyone since the blue laws of the 1700's are still in place in NW Ohio
NO BEER SALES ON SUNDAY

Hmm, maybe we should burn some witches later...."}
{"text":"Unreal BBQ ribs fall off the bone. Beer is micro brew and great. Can't say enough good things about here. I eat here at least 2 times a month"}
{"text":"Lagerheads is my local bbq / bar food \" go to \" if I don't want to venture out of Medina.  I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and let me tell you the wings at Lagerheads are amazing!  I could also eat their beer cheese soup for every meal.  Beer has awesome taste, but if we are being picky here it could use slightly more carbonation.

Staff has always been more than accommodating.  The atmostphere is a bit better in their bar area than it is in the smaller dining area.  Great place, check it out."}
{"text":"Great beer and BBQ!  

Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30.  The house has 6 beers that they make.  I had their IPA and loved it.  

We were just coming from a big lunch, so eating again wasn't a priority, but damn the place smelled good!  And we had it on good advice their pulled pork and brisket was excellent.  So we tried the sampler platter.

Enough pulled pork for a meal, and it was fantastic.  Long strings of pork nicely seasoned without any type of sauce.  I need to figure out how to make the same in my smoker.  Although mine is pretty good, this was excellent!  And the beef brisket was good, too.  Nice smoke ring around the edge, great flavor.  There were 3 rib bones.  I don't think these were babybacks, but the meat was good and fell off the bone.  Wasn't impressed, however, with the BBQ sauce.  Too much like Open Pit to me.  Lastly, there were 2 chicken wings.  These were full wings, including both the wing and drumette.  We got the spicy garlic BBQ sauce.  They were excellent.  You could really taste the chargrilled flavor in the wing.  Only disappointment was the wing sauce was ladled on the wings, they weren't tossed in it so some of the wing was left uncoated.  Got mixed feelings on that, as I'm a big fan of sloppy wings, but you wouldn't have tasted the chicken as well.

We also tried the pig tails...beef brisket and cheese in a deep fried tortilla.  Almost tasted like a flauta.  It was good, but served with the same Open Pit style BBQ sauce.  Although, I liked the sauce on the pig tail better than the ribs.

Lastly, as we were leaving, a guy sitting down next to us at the bar got the Saturday prime rib special.  OMG, this thing was HUGE!  Look at the picture, had to be 2+\" thick!  Apparently, this is a Saturday after 5:00 special...and a lot of people know about it.  When we arrived around 3:30, there were only a few people there.  By 5:30, there were people waiting."}
{"text":"I really thought the address must have been wrong because this place is in a residential-type area.  Glad we found it, though.  They brew their own beer here and from what I tasted they were pretty solid.  I had the Smoke House Sampler which came with ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and wings.  Everything on the sampler was good except for the pulled pork.  But the wings, which I was least excited about when ordering, were awesome.  They were very large, meaty, and the spicy curry sauce was great.  We'll be returning for certain."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area! Everything is absolutely delicious. I was nervous when I first went with my family because from the outside it looked like a biker bar, but oh wow was I blown away by the pulled pork and BBQ ribs. And the wings are to die for too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lazy afternoon lunch recently, sat at the bar to watch the Ryder Cup as well.

I ordered a \"Refresher\" IPA and settle in on a pork sandwich.  When the meal arrived, the pulled pork was served on a large hoagie style roll (dry) and came with fries and a pickle spear.  The available bottled sauce is both slightly sweet and spiced but also had a somewhat coffee / clove taste to it (I just could not put my finger on the unusual flavor).  The fries were a bit overdone, but adding malt vinegar helped cure that.

My beer choice was a nice accompaniment, and the meal was neither rushed nor slow...just right."}
{"text":"Very plain interior but the bbq ribs were delightful as was the onion ring appetizer! The beer was so-so and really wasn't anything to get excited about"}
{"text":"Went to Lagerheads last night, and was pleased with the place.  I tried the Winter Mischief beer, which was very good, and also got the sampler of all 6 beers on tap.  All were great!  I loved the coleslaw, tons of dill it was delicious!    I ordered the porkloin dinner, which I was not a fan of.. about half fat.  The fries were OK, but they weren't fresh cut.  Hush puppies were good, and the Sloppy BBQ sandwich was good.  We'll be back!  Very cool atmosphere, only downside is how far it is for us, and how far off the freeway, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I had multiple people recommended this place to me and rightfully so! It's kinda in the middle of nowhere in Medina. My fiancé and I loved it! My fella got a pulled chicken bbq sandwich with the smokie robbins lager. He loved both. I ordered the flip flop chicken with sweet potato tots, so good. The Abbeyville Trippel was a delicious ale choice as well! Our waiter was Nicholas, super nice and efficient. Great service and food. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love Lagerheads.  Pulled pork nachos are amazing!  Have had several items on their menu but the Butt sandwiches are amazing.  Servers are always friendly.  Great gem outside of Medina."}
{"text":"I go and and think this will be awesome, but it is just pretty good.  It is a solid choice."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Lagerheads (a Saturday night) and the parking lot was packed - had to wait for a spot to open but we figured that was a good sign. They did not disappoint, food was delicious. I had the prime rib (served Saturdays only) and my husband tried the barbecued chicken. Both meals were delicious including the creamy coleslaw and sweet potato tots. Great service too. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ restaurant in the area. If you want the Best BBQ in town go to this place you will be amazed what you find the food is out of this world. Every year my church Medina community church caters from Lagerheads and we enjoy it for a fundraiser. I hope everyone consideres catering. If I want BBQ I will go to Lagerheads not Dicky's BBQ....."}
{"text":"oh good lord. fantastic food outstanding service. and the deserts. HOMEMADE. how many restaurants can boast that ?!
just try it. it's closer than you think. wow. and great micro beer too!

wow 4 years ago? dang. oh well  ok. now it's 04/18. not once have i had a complaint about this place, but i have hit the chink in the armor. 
salmon is usually very good. get it blackened, as does my daughter but this time, hers was raw in the center. yuk! they made good by taking it off the bill, but knowing my kid. this place is off the list!
but i must say. a great place. everyone deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Danielle and I have been to Lagerheads a few times and the food is always really good as are the beers. we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome pork rinds. The food was good and the workers were very friendly. Nice place to have a beer and some munchies."}
{"text":"Was in there on a Sunday afternoon.  Bartender could not handle herself behind the bar.  I asked for a menu and she did not come back to ask if I would like to order.  It was about 45 mins. later when I held up the menu like a protest rally sign that she finally came over and asked what I would like to order.  The Black and Bleu Burger was good, portion size was good the price however was a bit high for a barbeque joint.  The large group of locals that I was with all commented that the establishment was a little pricey.  I was paying for beers as I drank them and had a couple of more that were purchased by other patrons.  When I asked for the check for the burger I was also charged for two additional beers.  When I consulted thee obviously undertrained and overwhelmed server, she stated \"yeah that was two more that you drank.\"  This was clearly incorrect but I was not going to split hairs over an additional 2 beers that I was incorrectly charged for.  My dissatisfaction was reflected in her tip.  I would suggest paying as you go and not opening a tab!
The group of a dozen or so that I was with took care of our business in a surrounding town and then finished the evening in a similar establishment not far from \"Lagerheads\".  The owner of that pub was very happy to have our business and all of the money that came with us.  All in all, I would stop at Lagerheads to use the restroom (it was very clean) but not for much else!"}
{"text":"Beer was very good service was excellent . Ordered the large order of wings and the beef brisket smothered in cheese, mushrooms and onions. Awesome wings and the brisket was excellent just disappointed to see all the time and work go into the proteins only to be served on a weak bun. That is my only complain im sure you can find a much better product than that. All in all very good and will be returning again in the future"}
{"text":"Get there early- very popular place. Best beer and bbq in the county."}
{"text":"Very good! The service was quick, friendly and effecient. The food is very good! I had a Pulled Pork sandwich. Well smoked and the BBQ sauce on the table was good. I sort of wish they had more options when it comes to sauce. I'm a mustard based sauce fan. No joy there.  :( My sister got the Brisket and loved it. My bother in law got a sandwich...and I cannot recall what it was! Overall, it was a delish experience and I look forward to going again.  And maybe indulging in a beer."}
{"text":"Lager heads is the best! I wish i could give it even more stars! Everything I've ate and drank here has been amazing. We return every chance we get. Abbey cakes are the best thing ever created and i could really eat them as my meal but why stop there? Lol .... both lagers & the red head taste the best and the high five doesn't taste the best but it smells good so it's easier to drink.. enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love ribs.   I'm a rib freak - a rib aficionado.  

The ribs here are awesome.

It's the sauce, the smokiness, and the char.  Put these attributes together on tender, loose on the bone meat and it makes me close my eyes and savor.  I'm salivating right now just writing this.

Aside from the ribs, the chicken is very good.  My daughter and I had the wings, and while they came with dipping sauces, I enjoyed them sans sauce.  The smoke and char on them was just right, and they were crisp and tender.

While the brisket was tasty, it was a bit dry.  And while my daughter really enjoyed the pulled pork, I thought it too was a little too dry."}
{"text":"Took mother and father in law for father's day excellent service tory was great food was the best bbq I've had in ohio beers were fantastic also great job we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 Star food reviews very often but their Barbecue is wonderful!  All their meats are great!  This is one special place!  Get a seat in their bar so you can enjoy their funky decor!  A local hangout... did I say it was popular?  Get there early because the parking lot fills up quickly!  My favorite go to is the half rack of ribs and the  collard greens which are the best I've had ... ever!
Add a pint of their IPA and its a perfect meal! 
Totally out of the way ... but worth the drive!!! Lol. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Something must have gone wrong with this business. My meal was Cold. My sides were cold. The cornbread muffin the size of a golf ball hopefully was purchased and wasn't made in their kitchen, awful. It just was a complete mess. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday. Place was busy. Got the highfive ipa which  was decent for an ipa 

Got the monster sandwich which was more hoagie than filling so it was disappointing. Should have got two more beers Instead. Cheese was not even melted. 

Over all I would go again but maybe expecting less before I come."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my sister and her fiancé. My husband had gotten a gift card and t-shirt from them for Christmas. I had the Brisket dinner and my husband had a special sandwich with pulled Brisket and prime rib with BBQ sauce. My Brisket was a bit dry but delicious and the coleslaw was really good. My husbands sandwich was amazing. He had one of their beer selections which he enjoyed. Overall we enjoyed our dinners and there was plenty on the menu for us to go back again and again! Definitely worth a few tries!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for sure. Love this place. A red neck setting in side and some of the best beer you will ever have. I am not much for lager but I drink it here. And their smoke food is the best around for sure. When we came here the first time we ordered their Abby cakes and were so mind blowing they could've been the meal them selves. A mixture of pulled pork, bell peppers, and other stuff lol and fried. Make sure you get these as your appetizer. You won't regret it, I promise!"}
{"text":"This place is dope. Great atmostphere. First time I ate here I salivated. Has become my favorite place to visit. Have been taking out of town friends here even though it is very far away. Totally worth it. WING,RIBS,NACHOS, BREWS---- ALL KICK ASS!!!!!

Seeds&Things"}
{"text":"Maria was awesome. Came in at the end of the night. Great suggestions on the food and beer, and all her top picks were great. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great Food! I had ribs and brisket very tender sauce was very good. I really liked the Scottish Ale. The High Five was my least favorite. Server was very polite, funny and attentive. Can't wait to try the Big Butt Sandwich. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Their CHICKEN WINGS ARE TO DIE FOR. Fresh brewed draft beer made right there on site. Their Bed Head beer tastes just like the Sam Adams beer. They also have sampler glasses that you can try all 6 of them if you would like. They have specials on Mondays where you can get a full order of wings for almost half of the price that you pay regularly. I have tried their steaks which are alright but the chicken wings are the best & they have very good barbecue food. You won't be sorry if you go there & try their wings. Gets real crowded on weekends. We went there late on Saturday, & hostess told us 45 minutes & we were seated in about a half an hour. They also have televisions where you can watch football or the weather whatever your preference is. In October ONLY- they have a PUMPKIN CHEESCAKE that is out of this world. I wish they had this all year long. It tastes like the original New York Cheesecake made in New York City."}
{"text":"Good smoked chicken dinners and craft beers"}
{"text":"We try to get here at least once a month to satisfy our BBQ cravings, even though it's a half hour ride. It's a friendly atmosphere with a choice of noisy bar or quiet dining room. Come during the week and it won't be too crowded. 
I'm not a beer geek, just a person who likes good beer. The choices here are very tasty. Order the beer sampler the first time if you're not sure what you want. 
As for the food, I'm addicted to the freshly made pork rinds. They're crispy, not greasy, light as a feather and go great with the hot sauce. I just wish they would salt them so I don't have to. The ribs are some of the best in northern Ohio and so is the smoked chicken, whether wings or whole. Their beer cheese soup is delicious, too. Skip the fries and corn bread and dig into the collards and baked beans. Sides are a little skimpy here, but the meat portions are big and tasty. If you stick to the things they do well here, BBQ and beer, you'll have a great family-friendly experience. If you're looking for gourmet brew-pub, you're in the wrong place and those of us who love Lagerheads just as it is, won't miss you."}
{"text":"The place was so hospitable for a group from soccer. We had a group on 13 adults and 7 kids come in for lunch. Outstanding BBQ and service! So much so we went back that night and had dinner! We told the other team parents this is a spot from now on- we need to come back to again and again. Wings are to die for! Many flavors to choose from and the beer is quite tasty too! My husband and I both had the brisket sandwich and a bowl of yummy onion soup. My dinner choice was homemade mac n cheese, coleslaw and cornbread that I could have eaten a dozen muffins. Another parent had the BBQ mixed platter and could barley finish it! Everyone raved about the onion rings as well. Too many good things to choose from on the menu. We will eat here every time we're in town with our soccer team. Not a single complaint from either meal in our group!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight after a couple of years. Well they changed the menu two years ago. Not for the better, food was inedible. Beer cheese soup tasted like a bowl of velveeta. Smoked chicken salad was way way too sweet, couldnt eat it. We will not be back. They shouldnt have messed with a good thing."}
{"text":"Just moved into the Medina area and we were looking for a place to grab lunch.  We hit the place during the off-lunch hours.  The place was pretty empty except for some folks sitting at the bar.  I would highly recommend the pork rinds!  Crackling right to the table and they were delicious.  We ordered three different sandwiches and all were outstanding, although enough to feed two or more!  I might suggest smaller portion options, or maybe share your lunch with another.  Service was good, atmosphere is ok.  Would stop back in again."}
{"text":"Wow everything we had was great! The smoked wings were an awesome start to our meal. Get a Cuban, you won't be disappointed. The smoked pulled pork and crispy crust made for a tasty sandwich. And if you're a sweet potato fan I highly recommend getting the tots."}
{"text":"We rode motorcycle there like many do.  It's a beautiful ride and the food - good, authentic BBQ made for a great evening."}
{"text":"The day before Fathers Day, I took my husband here for lunch to celebrate. We ordered the Pork Belly Tacos to share for our appetizer. Those were quite good. We then ordered the Rib Teaser with 2 sides each. We both had Cole Slaw as one of the sides. It was described in the menu as having 4 bones. We each received 3. They were room temperature, yet still tasty. I took a bite of the Cole Slaw, and it tasted very sour/spoiled. I did Not finish. My husband thought it tasted sour, but DID finish it. One hour after leaving, my husband began feeling ill. He became violently sick some time later and throughout the night. The next morning (Fathers Day) I called the Manager to inform him of what had happened. He apologized and offered to send us a gift card. I have waited for 2 weeks to write this review, and to give the Manager time to make good. I suppose this establishment doesn't care about customer service, or repeat customers."}
{"text":"Perfect date night for two.  I love this place!  From appetizers to salads and ribs and dessert.  This is one of my favorites, hands down."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite BBQ place I've been to in Ohio. Second to Pig Iron. Lagerheads is a bit of a 'country' drive, but onceyou're there it is really a nice place. It's got a huge on-site smoker, cute patio (not for dining), large bar area and plenty of seating. It's got great atmosphere and great food to match.

The service is friendly and on the slower side, but not sooo slow you'd complain. It looks like sitting at the bar would be fun and fast. 

Lagerheads is my parent's absolute favorite BBQ as far as ribs and briskett go. For pulled pork, it's still Pig Iron. I had the pulled pork sammie (my BBQ test meal) with fresh cut fries. The pulled pork was good, just a tad dry, but great smoky flavor. Their sauce was pretty good too. Not too thick and not too runny. The fries were fries. Overall, my meal here was better than average for BBQ and blew Hoggy's out of the water. 

Lagerheads is definitely a place that deserves repeat visits!"}
{"text":"Beef Brisket is excellent. Barnburner is great on draft. The interior tables could use a little updating - two of the chairs at the table wobbled. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Everything here is good to eat.  Try the big butt or their pulled pork!  They have a great selection of beer as well as their own microbrews which are great!  They can get busy and have a long wait with little space to wait unless it's warm and you are a smoker."}
{"text":"O Lager Heads! 

This place belongs in a downtown. It has great beer, awesome food, and a cool atmosphere. But it is actually located in the middle of no where. My home town! 

It is literally sandwiched between two corn fields and a farm. It has recently updated decor and the structure is much improved over the place that existed before it. A true makeover compared to the dump that was there before it. It is great, think woodsy sports bar. 

Anyway the chicken wings are literally wings. Not the mini wings at BW3s, literally chicken wings. Charred on a grill and everything. How can you beat that?! Add the microbrews to the mix and this place is an all star joint. 

I highly recommend the white ale, and the german style beers. They nail it. HARD. And who knew in the middle of Medina/Valley City. An awesome find, if you can find it."}
{"text":"Celebrated my brothers birthday on 9/30.  Yes there was a wait but you would expect that on a Saturday. Our group consisted of 6 hungry people.  We were hungry by time we were seated.   The service was excellent.   The food was OUTSTANDING!!!  Started with Pork Rinds.  Main course was ribs sweet potato tots and coleslaw.  Best ribs around.  You actually tasted the smoke.  Coleslaw was best around as well.  To wash it down had a Barn Burner.  Wonderful craft beer.

I highly recommend if you love bar b que."}
{"text":"I found Lagerheads through yelp, including it as a stop during my latest Ohio turnpike business trip.  If you're using your Garmin, don't be concerned if your drive is 'country' and two-lane residential... you're on the right path.  I arrived a bit before 5pm, so the place was relatively empty.  Friendly, prompt service from the bartender/hostess.

I tried the Smokehouse Sampler (3 ribs, a couple slices of brisket, a heap of pulled pork and two wings).  I don't love wings, and my waitress let me sub another bone plus more pork, after checking with the kitchen.  My entree came with two sides (I chose cornbread and hushpuppies, because I couldn't decide between the two), for $17.   I loved the ribs, which were individual bones, with a decent smoke ring, tender, fall off the bone meat, very little fat (but still juicy), with BBQ sauce grilled on.  The hush puppies and brisket were good - tender, pull apart, smoke ring, but a tad dry.  I didn't care for the pulled pork (not enough flavor or juiciness) or the cornbread.

I'd return for the ribs.  Seriously good ribs!"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and ate here twice. The food is average and my opinion nothing really to rave about. If you live locally and looking to go out to eat this is your place. But if your not from the area don't make a special trip out here. The only thing I thought was good, was the beer. Been here in a busy Saturday evening and also on a Tuesday evening, both times the service was nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"It was a 1.40 min wait however Jasmin on the door arrange every one perfectly she was fun and kept every one up dated thank you!! 
The food was awesome as ever you need to go"}
{"text":"Just giving 5stars there ipa is one of the best I ever had I will come back it's a small place so come early"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!   The staff was outstanding the food was great!!   Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stopped here last night to watch a little basketball. I had heard this place had great microbewed beer and barbeque food - and I heard right! For beer I had the \"Kilt 'Em All\" which had a nice malty flavor, that was smooth and not too overpowering (so I stuck with it for a couple more). For food I ordered \"The Combo\" appetizer because it allowed me to sample the wings, ribs, onion rings, and the cream cheese jalapeno wraps. The ribs had fantastic flavor; the wings (with Carribean jerk rub) were big and had great flavor as well; the beer battered onion rings were about as good as it gets; and the jalapeno wraps (like little won tons) were loaded with cream cheese and served with a side of plumb sauce. I will definitely be heading back to this place - however, deciding what to order may be a problem."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! Absolutely delighted with the food and service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is amazing. Not your average restaurant in a shopping plaza. Sits by itself in the country in Medina. The décor is also cool with the feeling that your at a local neighborhood tavern in a gravel parking lot.

Don't be fooled by getting a small order of 3 wings and a large order of 6. Each wing is twice the size of your average wing and are very filling. I got the Sloppy \"Big Butt\" sandwich. For around $9, I struggled to finish this and I got an appetite. They also give you a generous portion of fries. I also heard the ribs here are amazing. Finally, they have a great list their famous Lager Heads brew that is excellent. I really liked the Red Bead Ale as it goes down easy with any sandwich. If you aren't into microbrews, they also have a list of domestic beers.

If you like microbrews and hidden finds in the country setting of Medina County, Lager Heads is the place for you."}
{"text":"Update: I hate to drop a business from 4 to 1 stars but the last 3 times I have been there (and brought friends that I have bragged to about the quality of the food) I have been so dissatisfied that I won't return. I gave it 3 tries and wanted it to be good again but the food has consistently been dry, overcooked and/or burnt to the point that it is black and like charcoal. I'm not talking about a good grilled and crispy outer crunch. My daughter ordered the Mac n Cheese. How do you ruin Mac n Cheese? It was dry, very little cheese or cream or something to make them more than cooked noodles. We asked if they would add some cheese or something it came back no better than it left. The wait staff is still great, the beer tasty but the cooks need to be replaced before I will return :(


I love this place. Would never have known they were there except for a friend who took me there. Fun atmosphere, especially on the weekend it does a great business. The food is excellent, although expect to clog an artery. Mostly very fatty foods. They make their own beer and it is good. The BEST WINGS I have ever eaten are here. Do yourself a favor and order the regular hot wings. I have tried a few of the other \"more interesting flavors\" but was always disappointed that I didn't get the regular hot ones. And the wings are the full sized ones, so a half order is always enough for me. Service is always good but expect to wait a little bit to get a table on the weekends b/c as I said, they get busy."}
{"text":"We love Lagerheads! But, not on Monday! We walked in, gave our name, and were told there would be a 30 minute wait. Really, there were 7 empty tables! My husband inquired about 10 minutes into the wait and he was told that they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen! I get that to a certain degree, but 7 tables? Maybe hire some more cooks. The pork rinds and beer choices are to die for! I usually get the pork, but decided to get the brisket this time. It was very very dry and burnt to a crisp. I barely took two bites. I will return, but I will not order the brisket! It would be nice if they would open a patio!"}
{"text":"Very good wings and BBQ. The menu does not change though, not in 6 years now! I would like to see more creativity in the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and good beer. I highly recommend the sampler platter. Also be warned the wings are not traditional wings so don't order qty based on BW3."}
{"text":"Great food! Great local beer! Great
Overall experience. The local BBQ sauce is sweet and a little tangy. Was able to get two tall (32 oz) beers a short (16 oz) beer and a couple appetizers. (Good portions). For less than $39.00 for two. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First off the food is great.  Three stars represents the whole experience.  The layout of the place is bad.  Front entrance cramped the searing process is k but no where to wait.   Once seated girls were great helpful and knowledgeable.  Food came out quick.  Ribs were the star.  Wings were very good smoked and grilled.  Collards underdone  mac n cheese not the best.  Onion rings were very good.  Overall food was a 8 and place is a 4.  Noise level in main room is ridiculously loud."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ restaurant in the area. Don't go to Dickey's...drive a little further and have real BBQ!  Great service, great beer, great food and amazing corn bread."}
{"text":"We had the lager fries for an appetizer. They were decent. Nacho cheese type sauce on fries with bacon and onions. The fries were good

We both got the sampler for dinner. My sides were Mac and Cheese and a salad. Hubs had baked beans and cornbread. The salad was crazy leaves and the ranch dressing was just ok. My pork was dry. The brisket was yummy as were the ribs. 

It was all decent but not great."}
{"text":"Damnnnn...those wings. The key is to not be intimidated or shy when they arrive in front of you massive and lathered in bbq sauce. I could almost hear the wings heckling me 'Bawk Bawk!'. This is no time for pageantry or formality. I attacked the wings with reckless abandon.

Smoky, juicy, crispy, tender. The smoke adds another dimension and you can taste it in each bite. I got a full order  - 6 monstrous pieces for $12. Great value, great taste and to top it off, a great selection of lager heads beer."}
{"text":"Great barbeque sauce and really good beer. It's an old roadhouse and the smell of smoked meat gets you salivating going before you step in the door. The motorcycle parking out front was being used every time I've been there. It's a little bit out of town, but the drive makes it all the more enjoyable an experience."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The food was fine, I had the half chicken and my husband had the pork loin. The service was really lacking this night though. The place was busy, but not so busy that no one could check on us or refill a drink! The parking lot was jam packed but there were still tables, so service should have been alright. We will probably go back because we live close by, but I'm not in a rush to get there soon."}
{"text":"Great beer and ribs!  This the first place I bring friends from out of town!  It's the first place they ask to go back to on there next visit.  Medina' best kept secret.  Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Took my wife and 3 year old daughter last night and was very pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a much larger place, and when we pulled up and saw what is basically a red barn, my expectations dropped. The staff and other patrons were VERY friendly and showed quick service. The BBQ Porkloin was amazing, the chicken fingers were greatly above average, great cole slaw... the works!  
Being a beer snob, I'm generally pretty critical about beer. I had their IPA, and it was decent. Just an average IPA, a little dark in color, but worth trying if you're into the style. My wife had their Belgian Wit, and that was very refreshing and tasty. I had a sample of their stout, and wasn't blown away, but I still enjoyed it. Nothing too special about it, just a solid all-around stout.
Very pleasant experience. I'll definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nailed the brisket! Platter was amazing with friend green tomatoes and a baked potato. Pretzels were super yum as an app!"}
{"text":"Great meats, home brews, and good BBQ!  Definitely a locals hangout and worth the drive."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place! I have yet to order something I did not like. The beer selection is vast and the food compliments it well. Friendly staff will just add to the great experience. Definitely a unique place that any explorer needs to try."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Lagerheads for close to 6 years! It used to be our favorite local, little secret. The pulled pork and brisket were always smoked to perfection! The hand cut fries were awesome! It was real BBQ and stood out above any and all other chains that claimed to be BBQ. 

Lagerheads was real BBQ...

Unfortunately, over the past two years or so the quality of the BBQ has decreased. Instead of pulled pork with a beautiful smoke ring, it now looks like the pork is cooked in a slow cooker and soaked in a sauce. In my opinion, to cover up the fact that the pulled pork no longer sits in a smoker for hours and hours. It tasted like it had a heavy dousing of liquid smoke, instead of hickory chips. And tonight, we were served pre-packaged French fries, instead of the fresh hand cut version they've served for the previous 6 years. 

When we asked our waitress when the fries changed she said about two months ago (approx. July 2013) and told us they aren't changing them back even after all the complaints. This tells me ownership isn't concerned with their loyal customers who have been with them since the beginning. The same loyal customers who are a big part of the reason they are experiencing the success they do today. 

Those of you who go to Lagerheads for the first time after reading this review, may think it's fine BBQ...and I'm sure it is, but it's not real BBQ. Now it's just like the rest of the chain restaurants. You missed out on the good ol' days!"}
{"text":"I often stop in here after playing golf as Shale Creek and love filling up on their wings. I swear they have some magic sauce or secret preparation, because I can not get enough. Pretty much every thing I've ever had has been amazing as well. The portions are very generous and the flavors are balanced. The atmosphere is also a plus, with high top seats in the bar area and plenty of seating in the dining. Whatever a Lagerhead is, I want to become one! Keep doing what you're doing and expect me back often."}
{"text":"We met two of our friends here on Saturday. None of us had been here previously and didn't know what to expect. We were coming here because of the beer. Let me tell you this place was great!

The beers were excellent. I tried the stout, the pale ale and the red. All were excellent. The stout was my favorite.  

We sat at the bar because there was an hour wait. We had a blast. Even though the bartenders were really busy, they were attentive and friendly. The other patrons were also friendly. 

After we were seated, we had the Cajun wings as an appetizer. These are full, smoked and seasoned wings and they were outstanding. These rank as some of the best wings I have ever had. I had the smoked brisket for my entree. It was outstanding. The vegetable of the day was fried green tomatoes   Everything was excellent. 

We will go back again. This is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This out of the way BBQ is well worth the trip. Our group enjoyed the pork crisps and onion rings before ribs, chicken and pulled pork, all good. My one request is to chop the pulled pork--the long strands make shoveling it in difficult. Got to get back for the brisket and tenderloins on the menu. Service is right there for you to add to the experience. Don't forget the bourbon barrel, it is the best!"}
{"text":"The beer is getting better,  Looking forward to the Tripel!  The food needs work.  they really need to change the menu.  All fried  and bbq.  If you have been here in the last five years you know the menu.  Go for the beer don't eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq, their chicken wings are the best and their Bed Head Red beer is a must have."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went out on A Monday night.  Not really knowing what to expect, she got a pulled chicken sandwich with fries and I ordered pork medallioms with sweet potato tots and mac n cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok..... but everything else was outstanding including the beer.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. I'm not a BBQ joint type of gal, but I dutifully went with my BBQ-loving boyfriend. Somehow, I ended up enjoying it more than he did. I got the seasonal spinich salad. I don't even remember all of the scrumptious things they covered it in, all I remember was that it was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. FRESH spinach, FRESH veggies, FRESH, vibrant fruit and an amazing House Dressing. I seriously used restraint in not licking the plate. 
The only reason I didn't give a higher review is because of my boyfriend's \"Meh\" attitude towards his porkloin. I mean, if they're known for BBQ and his was \"Meh,\" I can't rightly give a higher star rating than \"A-OK,\" now can I? Either way, I'll be back for that salad."}
{"text":"Sloppy BBQ is the way to go! Huge pulled pork sandwich, covered in coleslaw and bbq sauce on a hoagie. The only thing I have tried there, but why stray from SUCH a great thing?? The fries are sometimes a little undercooked (mushy), or they've been sitting too long. But when they're done right, they're good. I'm honestly not a huge fan of their beers, I wish they had a bigger selection."}
{"text":"I enjoy Lagerheads, with as long as its been there we have been until last summer.

The pork rhinds are out of control good, the barbecue sauce is really fantastic (can drink it with a straw). Some people like this style of chicken wing where they are attached together, I don't particularly care for that style (too much work) but they are flavorful!!

The burgers are great, the drinks are mixed well and the venue is enjoyable for a social night out.

Lagerheads is a diamond in the rough, a little off the beaten path but very well worth it."}
{"text":"1st time visiting the area and wanted to find something local.  The atmosphere is great and service is friendly.  It is off the beaten path so was full of locals.  There is a separate dining section which is likely where families would be seated.  I was seated in the bar section which has more then enough seating.

I was not so impressed with the food. The cornbread was less than desirable (a bit too floury) and my ribs were burnt.  It's a shame because the BBQ sauce was quite tasty. Unfortunately, I believe they may have added extra sauce to my ribs to cover their mistake in overcooking the ribs.

As for beers, I only tasted one. It's too bad they don't have a small sampler on the menu - I would have gladly ordered it to taste all of the different types they had on tap (approx 6 of their own).   I also asked the service attendant what she would recommend as far as their local beers go and she did not seem to be very knowledgeable on which would be a local favorite. I ended up ordering their Stout which tasted like a Guinness clone."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the service.   Service was awesome now just need a new cook.  My girlfriend and I were highly disappointed with the quality of the food.  We started with the 3 wing garlic Parmesan as a appetizer.   These are full chicken wings and are huge.  These lacked any real garlic Parmesan taste and left much to be desired.   We still had high hopes for this bbq place.  I ordered the half rack of ribs and beef brisket and side of fries.  The ribs game out very dry and burnt with little meat.  The beef brisket was very overlooked and tasted like roast beef.  The fries were average and only decent item with my meal. I expect more out of a true bbq restaurant.  My beautiful girlfriend ordered the ny strip steak with asparagus.  The menu described the steak as melt in your mouth.  They must be thinking there customers are sharks because the steak was so tuff and dry and was a big disappointment to my girlfriend who had a tuff time just chewing this meat. Now we drove Out of the way to visit this highly yelp reviewed BBQ place.  Now I have to take my gf to coach outlet to makeup for this huge mistake."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after church and it was pretty good. We both had pulled pork sandwiches with fries. The pork was very flavorful and the fries were fantastic. However, it should be noted that they cook their barbecue in a variety of spices that I found to be too spicy for me to be able to finish my sandwich. I could see the red pepper flakes very easily and since I don't eat spicy foods at all, I wasn't able to finish my sandwich. Prices also seemed a bit high. We may try it again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I haven't visited Lagerheads since last year so I was excited when we had the opportunity to go back. We ordered the smokehouse sampler because we loved this when we visited before. Much to our surprise it was not nearly as good as we remembered. The pork was bland, brisket was terribly dry, and wings just okay (Fatheads spoiled me). Honestly the only good thing about the sampler was the amazing ribs. So I would suggest ditching the sampler and just going for the rib dinner! The pork rind appetizer was really good if that's your sort of thing while the side salad I got with my entree was really sad. 

Service was also really slow and inconsistent. Sad that this place has gone down hill a little!"}
{"text":"Heading up to a playoff football game and found this gem on the way up! I had the house soup and a sampler platter and was all great. Soup was so good when I return I will get some pig tails to accompany it. Brisket and pulled pork were excellent with the house bbq sauce and the wings with hot bbq sauce had the right heat with a touch of sweet, but the star imo was the ribs! The ribs were so tender and had a great Smokey and sweet flavor! The service was fast and friendly on a packed Saturday night we got in at the bar and were in and out. After placing our order appetizer was there in minutes followed by the main dish almost as soon as we finish our appetizer. A great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Very nice wait staff, really made me want to like them

The smokehouse sampler platter consisted of three ribs, at least a half pound of brisket, half again as much pork and two wings, which were full chicken wings.  Throw in the two sides and this is a heck of a lot of food for 18.99. Two people could share it with no one going without

Ribs - overcooked, dry and a complete waste of time

Chicken wings - undercooked and pink/bloody at the bone.  I wish I could say that it was just smoked meat, but the pink and blood was near the bone and the joints, so they plainly weren't fully cooked.  A shame, because the spicy bbq sauce was one of the best things I tasted. 

Brisket - cooked perfectly, but lacked seasoning.  It was a sad, because it was very moist and tender.  Some salt and pepper and this would have been a home run, as it was, it was a \"meh\".  

Pork - watery, mushy and just plain bad.  Not even their pretty good sauce could salvage it

The service was good and it's a nice looking place.  Plenty of cars in the parking lot, so I doubt they care much about anything I have to say,  but this place wouldn't last 6 months anywhere in the South

PS putting gravy on brisket does not make it southern"}
{"text":"Best ribs I have had in Ohio. Definitely worth the trip, or traveling to Medina. Glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ, IPA ain't bad either! Got the full rack of ribs, excellent!! Appetizers were good too. Got the pretzels and beer battered onion rings. Would definitely return, great spot in the country. Only complaint would be BBQ sauce choices. While you're brewing the beer, maybe you oughtta brew up another sauce or two!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Went on a Saturday and almost didn't find parking so I'm not the only one to think this. The brisket I had melted in my mouth, best I've ever had.  Place was a little loud due to the open style seating, and it looked like a long wait but well worth it. I sat at the bar and got service right away."}
{"text":"My friend and I took a long country drive out to Medina last weekend and appropriately wanted some good country BBQ - and Lagerheads definitely satisfied.
     The place looks perfect right when you pull in - a Roadhouse nestled quite literally in the middle of nowhere in rural medina - next to a cornfield and a mile drive from the local high school down gorgeous winding roads.
      There's a nice porch filled with rocking chairs up front if there's a wait while inside the joint is spacious but cozily packed as well.  
     Our waitress was quick, incredibly nice, and very helpful when deciding on our meals for dinner - which can be hard to pick from as everything sounds amazing. They smoke their meats right there and you can definitely tell, as I could in my perfectly smoky, moist, bbq-y, and flavorful ribs/brisket combo.  it was seriously so good that I considered getting another to-go order.  The sides were equally as amazing, especially the baked beans.  My buddy got the Cajun pasta dish which he loved and I also tried which I will attest was just as delicious.  Each was wonderfully complimented by (many) of they well crafted local brews as well.
      This joint is worth the drive for an authentic, out in the backwoods, country, roadhouse BBQ experience and will definitely satisfy your cravings for some 'que and brews."}
{"text":"Great place with some good BBQ. I had the sloppy BBQ samwhich, which was pretty good. The pulled pork was delicious, unfortunately the coleslaw tasted like the bottom of a pickle jar, a lot of dill. And the hoagie roll wasn't too fresh. Fries were all right. The service was very good however and my party of 8 had a great time and was well taken care of."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the ribs but when they came they were so tough and undercooked we couldn't even cut them off the bone with a knife. Pink inside too. The waitress was very nice about it and didn't charge us. Ended up leaving and going to another place for ribs.... Moosehead's in Olmstead Falls is the best for ribs!!!"}
{"text":"We were pretty happy with our dinner and would likely return.

We started with the chicken wings which were not your typical wings! They were actual wings, not just drums and teeny tiny wings. They had a dry rub on them and the flavor was fabulous. I get a little queasy over chicken on the bone, so my sweetie pulled the meat off the bones for me because it was that tasty. Ill grow up some day.

My sandwich was awesome and a huge, huge portion. Crispy fries, creamy coleslaw and of course, a delicious BBQ sauce. I feel like all BBQ joints are hinged on the flavor of their sauce. Lagerheads remains in the competition.

We didn't have beer, but the Long Island and my unsweet iced tea were great. Prices were about average and so was the service.
That rocky parking lot is a real ankle breaker, though!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, was out in the area to go to Castle Noel. I went with 2 other friends, we ordered the wings, Lager Melt, pork rinds, and pickled eggs appetizer. Everything was amazing! We also tried the Lager head beer which was also good, if you don't want the Lager head beer they also have other brewery's on tap. The service was also good for the size group we had. Only thing that sucks about the place is it's a 35min drive from my house or I would go all the time."}
{"text":"I love finding out of the way places. This place is in the middle of a cornfield. Really can't get too much more out of the way. Then you walk into a cool brewpub with incredible BBQ. The craft beer, brewed on site, rivals Great Lakes and the food blows GLB away. I don't give 5s unless it's a local institution, but this one is close."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night and service was great very fast seating with no wait for us. 
We have been here quite a few times and food was always good. But I had the RIBS and was not to impressed very dry and tough and were just tasteless but this will not stop me from going back."}
{"text":"We got the smokehouse platter: pulled pork, brisket, ribs & wings w/cornbread. Every single thing on the plate ROCKED. 

If you come here, you MUST get wings. WHOLE wings seasoned, smoked, and then grilled in one of many tasty sauces. Their BBQ sauce is awesome also. 

Had the Savage Stout... Outstanding. Tasted the Smokie Robbins... Even better. 

Sat at the bar, had perfect service. An all-around great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the best wings, sauce, craft beer and relaxing environment in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the area, Lagerheads is probably the restaurant my family and I have visited most frequently. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, but it's worth the trip for the smoky barbecue! Be careful about your timing...it gets really busy on Friday and Saturday nights and the wait is sometimes up to an hour.

If it's your first trip to Lagerheads, I'd say you can't go wrong with the fresh pork rinds, the smoked chicken wings, or the White Water Witte. These pork rinds aren't like the dusty curls you find at the store for a buck a bag...the huge plate of them arrives at your table piping hot and still crackling. The wings are full-sized, smoky, and tender. I just think the citrusy Begian Witte is a great complement to barbecue in general.

Some of the entrees I've tried include one of the pulled pork sandwiches (huge), the IPA chicken (only slightly on the dry side but with great flavor), and the ribs. The ribs are tasty, but I think I actually liked them better the second day as leftovers! They also have a variety of sides, ranging from collard greens to hush puppies with all the standard options in between. The menu is pretty extensive, so I still haven't tried all of the things that have caught my eye.

Oh, and they usually have a cornbread sundae for dessert. I was so curious about it for my first few visits but had never saved enough room! I finally tried it the last time I went...it's crumbled cornbread drizzled with honey and raspberry sauce and topped with pecans and ice cream. If those flavors sound like they're up your alley, give it a try!

Service here has been hit or miss for me, but it seems like it gets better every time I go. At first the servers were inattentive or really unaware of the items they had run out of, like the time my server came back to the table three times to tell me that they didn't have the beer or cocktail I had ordered. That said, on our last visit we had Emma as our server and she was delightful!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time the other day and I must say I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The staff was pleasant with fast service. My favorite was the crackling skins, the ribs were good too. The mac & cheese could've been better but I won't hold that against them. I diffently will visit this restaurant again."}
