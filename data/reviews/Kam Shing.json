{"text":"They serve food family style, so don't order individually. We ended up with way too much food, and spending more than we should have for a party of 8."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese restaurant with a very polite staff. The food was very delicious, but the wait was long. Bottom Line- This is your basic Chinese restaurant with some semi authentic and a great staff. The prices are quite competitive...if your in the area, why not give this place a try. I neither recommend or disapprove of this place as there are many similar Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Its a must for roast duck and chow mein.
Treasure bean curd soup is also a good entree."}
{"text":"The best hot and sour soup in town. The portions for anything are huge and the prices are very decent. You can easily share for two a plate and a soup and be full. Everything is delicious"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves extremely good cashew chicken and soup but I would now recommend everyone to AVOIT IT. I was polite and cheerful but waiter in charge was aggressive and insulting, as if I was some lame intern he could boss around.

I complied but told him was attitude was disrespectful. He said yes and told me to do just what he said, raising his voice.

I walked away. A shame, I considered it at one point as the best Chinese restaurant around the 'hood. Always keep your head up people !"}
{"text":"Whenever I want real tasty and fresh Chinese food, we always come here to eat. It's always fresh and delicious! We always order the same dishes, chicken with noodles and vegetables, beef and Chinese broccoli, general Tao, Singapore style noodles and the wonton soup. We try to avoid going there between 6:30pm and 7:30 pm, the place is always full."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe....c'est mon restaurant Chinois préféré
Je suis toujours satisfaite à chaque fois, l'essayer c'est l'adopter"}
{"text":"This is the staple Chinese restaurant for my family over the past 20+ years since the original location before they moved to larger digs in the Plaza across the street. The portions are consistently large, and you get a lot of bang for the buck. However, the quality has regressed since the 90s, and I have been fortunate enough to experience Chinese food across the world since then, even Hong Kong the home of this type of cuisine. Besides, I don't eat meat and Cantonese food is not the ideal cuisine if you're not a fan of seafood. The vegetarian dishes share the same formula as many of the meat dishes, just substract the meat and sometimes substitute tofu.

Service has always been stoic even for regulars over the years and that itself hasn't changed. This sort of restaurant is best with large groups because the portions would be overkill for a single eater. Being able to order multiple dishes in a group demonstrates the dexterity the kitchen has given the expansive menu."}
{"text":"Les crevettes Salt&Pepper.... miam miam"}
{"text":"I'm a Chinese food lover!!! Kam Shing is my first and only love. She first first embraced me with her love when I had the delicious chicken fried rice, general tao chicken (spicy and regular), beef with vegy chow meing, shrimp toast, peanut butter dumplings, shrimp wong tong soup and much more. Over the past 15 years I've been loyal to her and she has been loyal to me. I have the perfect Chinese gastronomical relationship with her and i feel the obligation to share this love with all my fellow yelpers. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the second time and it was pretty bad. Everything was bland and one friend got sick and had to rush for the bathroom lol."}
{"text":"My family are life time clients of the restaurants I have spent 30 of my 32 birthdays at that restaurant their food is amazing fresh there staff are always kind and polite shout out to Billy and Mr.MA I highly recommend both restaurants to anyone that is looking for quality food a celebration feel at home restaurant as dishes the Sweet and sour soup is heaven the duck the chow mein and beef and Chinese broccoli."}
{"text":"I find the price-quantity ratio EXCELLENT in this restaurant!! And for my taste, most of the food is 4/5 star tasty!! I personally recommend the beef and vegetable noodle plate (the small one almost is enough for 2 good eaters!!) And the big plate which is around 9$ is definitely enough for 2 big eaters making a good good meal come out to around 4.50$ each! The salt and pepper shrimps is also a must for fried shrimp amateurs out there and finally i thing their won ton soup is amongst the tastyest won ton soups i have had! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the only things that I miss about my hometown is the Peking hot soup at Kam Shing (aka hot and sour soup). I haven't found any place in either Montreal or NY that matches the taste. I've been eating here since it was at the original location across the street when I was a kid, and every order included that soup! It comes in huge containers for take-out but I graduated to my own one as an adult and eat it as a meal. Seriously, this soup has a unique sourness and consistency that makes it addictive. I miss it so much, I wish my family could fed-ex it to me.

Other items I love: spring rolls, general tao chicken (doesn't taste like any other tao either), sweet n sour fish filet, and 2 kinds of mushrooms with snow-peas. 

I miss you Kam Shing!"}
{"text":"1st time for me going to this restaurant. The food was very good, portions are huge. The staff was very fast for service and the prices are reasonable. I would recommend this restaurant, epically the egg rolls; they are huge. The won ton soup  ( I thought would be for only 1 person) was more than enough for 2 people.

Bottom line, will be going back."}
{"text":"Le Kam Shing, c'est un menu vraiment étourdissant de 300 items, un espèce d'immense demi sous-sol dans la particulière Plaza Côte-des-Neiges, des nappes en plastique, beaucoup de sourires et quelques ballonnements.

La bouffe est très bonne et on s'en sort à bon prix quand on partage les assiettes entre amis. On finit toujours par ramener les restes parce qu'on a commandé en quantité industrielle et personne ne s'en plaint. :D

Par contre, le service est très moyen; hier, le serveur a attendu la fin du repas pour nous ramener de l'eau (et il a fallu lui en demander). Personne ne s'est assuré que tout était à notre goût et les assiettes sont arrivées à plusieurs minutes d'intervalle. Les ribs étaient brûlants alors que les nouilles et le duck étaient devenus froids. 

Je me demandais à quel point le resto était propre et je suis encore perplexe. Les toilettes étaient assez repoussantes et ça sentait la vieille moppe. J'ai préféré attendre d'être à la maison. Plate hein. 

En somme, allez-y pour vous bourrer la panse sans trop porter attention aux autres éléments et vous serez satisfaits, parce que MIAM!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this restaurant for over 10 years.  My entire family loves this place but after today none of us are going back.  As always we ordered the samething and usually we are in and out in about one hour but today it took 20 mins for them to bring us water and take our order. Then another 30 mins for soup.  We waited until 30 mins after that but no one came with our food.  People that came after us ate and left.  I got upset and went to the manager and he said food takes long to prepare.  Are u kidding me?? Entire staff was rude and didnt understand why we were upset.  We cancelled our order and left.  We paid for soup and shrimp toast which we didnt even eat but the manager charged us for it bc it was ready.  Who does that?? This was the WORST experience ever.  If u want shitty service then go to this restaurant otherwise find another one."}
{"text":"Kam shing have been there for as far as i can remember. The menu evolved over the years. Its one of those restaurants that you enjoy more as a group,  because you can order a variety of meals . You must start with a shrimp won ton soup,  then 1 egg roll (fried the old fashioned way and very greasy.). They added on the menu the hunan dumplings with peanut butter sauce(its good but i ate better ones). For the main course, it gets difficult  as there is too many good choices. .. the fried noodles, pineapple chicken, garlic apare ribs, beef with ginger and scalions, the duck (take the boneless) and my favorite the general tao.the decor is very basic,  it looks like a big cafeteria but its clean."}
{"text":"To me this is the best Chinese restaurant in the city.....it's not fancy, it's not healthy and it's not renovated, but damn is it tasty! The General Tao is drenched in an amazing sauce that begs you to have more of it then you should. The shrimp wonton soup is a great portion size for just me but normally it's for 2 people. Follow it up with the peanut butter dumplings and salt&pepper shrimps. The place is nice and big so there's never really a wait and the staff are very nice even though they usually have no clue what you're saying. It should probably scare me that the bill is always so cheap for such an enormous amount of food but sometimes you just need to eat, enjoy and not ask too many questions :)"}
{"text":"This is a mega restaurant.  There are different branches.  This review is about the one on Cote-des-neiges.  Unfortunately, service is brusque and impersonal. Our server, an old man, would not recommend any dishes. \"Different people like different things.\"  Really ... no signature dishes?

Food is not bad, certainly above average. And there are many choices.  We especially enjoyed the Peking Duck (heavenly crispy duck skin wrapped in rice flour crepe with hoisin sauce and some garnishing). However, unlike many Chinese restaurants which cook up the duck meat in a separate dish, Kum Shing does not do so.  Rather, the duck meat is served as is, piled next to the crispy skin, but is tasty nevertheless.

If one comes here, he/she should pretty much have an idea what to order. The food will not disappoint. Just don't expect much service. Thus overall I've given 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place it's the best place for hot and sour soup in town , the other plates are from good to very good but my problem is that i ordered to take out and every time they gave me something else or forgot an item . That's not cool Kam Shing its actually very frustrating after the 3rd time , if it weren't for your good food i would have never came back so i am sorry but that's a 2 stars to wake you up and maybe pay more attention to your customers."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian now and have been going to kam Shing since before I went veggie.

I found the quality of their meat poor quality back then. My friends that still go there attest to the average quality of the meat even today. The general Tao chicken for example is still just fatty chicken in batter spiced up - not great at all.

But they have a KILLER fab hot and sour soup. Best in the city in my opinion.
They also have really fresh vegetables that I often get mixed with noodles in a black bean sauce. So yes, it's worth it to come here for the fab soup and veggie dishes that they can make."}
{"text":"They have the best shrimp toast ever!!!
The food here is always fresh and delicious! Every time I order, I'm always excited to indulge in their food. They are known for their authentic traditional Chinese food. It's not just a chinese resto, it's one of the better Chinese restaurants. Their service however needs improvement ! It takes 25-30 minutes for the food to be prepared so it's not fast but I think theyre always super busy and they want to make sure the food they serve is fresh and Delicious!

Overall, if you want awesome Chinese food this place is your best bet! I definitely recommend them!! Oh and get that shrimp toast... they are to die for !!!! Do not pass it up they are a must."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with good Chinese food so one night while really craving some I decided to come here for take out.

I agree with the other posters that they make a good hot and sour soup.  It isn't really on the spicy side but they have the sour part nailed down which a lot of places don't seem to get.  They also don't skimp on ingredients which is another plus.  Also the peanut butter dumplings were another personal favourite.  You could really taste the shrimp in the dumplings and the peanut sauce was delicious!  I wasn't a fan of the noodles stir fried with vegetables.  I found the texture of the noodles a little off.  They were too chewy  in my opinion and the vegetables were kind of bland.  Some salt to liven things up would have been good.  The beef and snow peas though was pretty good.

You should definitely check this place out if you're in the area.  They don't deliver so you have to pick up.  The restaurant itself was busy but not so busy that if you didn't have a reservation you wouldn't get a seat."}
{"text":"Shing This

     The Hunan Chicken is pretty feckin' delicious as well as the General Tao, but overall, i'd walk across the street and eat at Ku-Mon...but that is just me.

{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.

We tried ordering the classic salted fish eggplant dish and they told us it was not available, then we tried ordering the lamb stew hot pot, which is another classic Cantonese dish and they told us it will take 40min-1h.
We finally placed out order of Cantonese fried noodles, shrimp in lobster sauce and fish and tofu hot pot. The food arrived pretty fast but the service was terrible. Instead of placing the dish in the centre of a table for 2, they place it half on the corner and I had to make sure that the dish didn't fall on the floor as soon as it arrived.
The shrimps with lobster sauce was under seasoned, flavourless and under cooked. The tofu in the hot pot was good but the fish was way over salted. I don't even know where to begin with the Cantonese fried noodles... Way over sauced, noodles were mushy, and who puts celery in Cantonese fried noodles?!
Only good thing was that portions were ok...

Looking around me, the one table behind me left without eating half their food... Looked like Cantonese fried noodles and salt and pepper shrimps... The other table on the other side waited for their menu for 10mins and the finally went to get menus themselves (great service...)

I would definitely not recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Oh my! What happened?? Service was terrible and food even worse. Maybe the crew was tired. Maybe they don't care anymore. I had the feeling that if you're not a regular, you're not worth the service. I got to the restaurant early with my mom before the rest of the family. We had no service until they saw my uncle come in. Then it all changed. I must say that my cousin is married to the daughter of the original owner of Kam Shing, the sweet Mr. Kwong. So these people know who he is. But that doesn't make it right. Not because they don't know me nor my mother that we deserved that kind of shitty service. Anyways...

The food is nothing like it used to be. Salty, very overly oily. It lacked flavour all together. It looks like it should but nah... I have nothing good to say about this place at the moment. What a shame. Really."}
