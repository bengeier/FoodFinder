{"text":"Busy Sunday night but still got a table quickly and had great service. A++ to the staff. Plates were generous. A little pricy but specials are available.
Have been for business lunches and have always been very happy."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food, great staff and owners that care! 
Never been disappointed. Always a personal touch.  Great ambiance in the Barbie dining room."}
{"text":"Wonderful resto. Kind and couteous staff and the food is delicious. You can see the love in the preparation of the food. The rib steak I had was perfectly cooked the way I wanted it, juicy tender and moist."}
{"text":"I started to visit this place after moving to west island....

Place is classy, upscale and nice decor compared to other Madison's in Montreal. And there is no price difference.

So far after trying majority of their burger menu, my favorite is still Madison burger and their skinny fries are different compared to other resto. Also i recommend to steak instead of the salmon.

A good place to visit with friends and family for lunch and dinner. 

Once in my experience the entire table i was in had dry food and let the manager knw while paying and he apologized 

Friendly staff and great service.."}
{"text":"I ate here many times,  but lately the food and the service went down a lot. May be the $11 special menu is too cheap that the waiters were not happy to serve the customers.  All of them looked very serious.  It took him more than 10 minutes for our waiter to take our order. He didn't ask us if we wanted to order any drink.  In fact,  my husband ordered coke and he forgot. My 9 years old son tried to call him politely many times to order a drink and he was ignored until I called him. The clam Chowder tasted nothing but flour. The coleslaw was tasteless and dry. The grilled chicken was the only one that good (very good in fact). The french fries needs to be improved (looked like fast food).  The spinach dip was tasteless too and I could taste dirty oil when eating the tortilla. 
I might give it another try in the future and hope it will improve."}
{"text":"The wait staff was extremely friendly. We enjoyed the baby back ribs, skirt steak, and the Madison burger and everyone in my party was pleased with their choice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the staff are friendly and kind. I didn't find the food to be that great. It is a little pricy too. I had the filet mignon which was over cooked and not that great. I got mashed potatoes as a side which were alright. Pretty average food. Nothing Special."}
{"text":"Je crois que j'ai pas de critique mes des compliments à dire car le services surtout la serveuse très poli et professionnel avec son vocabulaire et ses connaissante on mis de la couleur pour se souper elle a servi Paul pour 6 hrs"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with some work colleagues tonight and food was excellent (steaks and rib combos)
Very friendly staff. Would go back"}
{"text":"It was a tough call on what to give Madison's as a rating. The food is okay, pretty good even, but the service and atmosphere are so-so.

I have been several times, once just my partner and myself, and several other times with groups. When I went with my partner and we sat in a booth, the atmosphere was quite nice, not too loud. But whenever I have been in groups, I find that the back area is just too loud and crowded, which really takes away from the dining experience.

When I was with a group, they brought water right away, but when I was with one other person, they didn't and instead asked if we would like drinks. Once I asked for water, I was asked about ordering drinks AGAIN, before I had my glass of water. This kind of annoys me, I can't be the only one! 

Bread, do they give bread? That is a burning question on my mind. Sometimes they bring it, sometimes they don't. I would love some consistency here.

The food itself is pretty good. For appetizers, we got spinach dip and garlic bread. Their spinach and cheese dip is so delicious! Well worth ordering. I would go back for the cheese dip again for sure.

Their garlic bread, however, gets 2 thumbs down. It was mostly cheese on bread, with very little garlic or butter. In fact, they could have marketed it as cheese-bread or grilled cheese, but it wasn't \"garlic bread.\" This was super disappointing to me, I love garlic bread.

The ribs they serve are great! I am picky when it comes to ribs but I really like theirs. The sauce isn't too sweet, it is just right, and they are always cooked to perfection. When we went, there was a 2-for-1 deal for ribs (with the purchase of an appetizer), which makes the ribs even better!

I have also had their chicken, which I find very moist and flavorful. Their sides (like fries and mashed potatoes) taste great and come in good sized portions.

Overall, I don't think I would go out of my way to go back, but I would definitely happily order their ribs if there is another group function for me to go to."}
{"text":"Je peux difficilement donner une meilleure évaluation. Ayant visité à plusieurs reprises ce restaurant pour bénéficier des midis 2 pour 22 $. (Une bonne aubaine des repas complets de ribs à 11 $ par personne.) Malheureusement, à chaque visite le service fut très lent pour des midis en semaine. Il y a peu de choses aussi frustrantes que de saliver pendent une longue période de temps, pour se faire servir ses ribs tièdes tirant sur température pièce. 

S'il pouvait servir à une température convenable et donner l'addition en une heure, je donnerais quatre étoiles. La nourriture est toute de même succulente. (À noter, nous étions un groupe de quatre à chaque visite.)"}
{"text":"I was invited to both Maddison resto in Laval & Desources on the same day
I didn't find the same service nor the taste in both restaurants. I have to admit I prefered the one in Desources. Their service was excellent & friendly. 
I had the salmon salad it was good & the salmon not too cooked. My friend had the ribs  & she liked the taste very much."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Bar maids are inexperienced. Didn't know what a porter was. Bar service was slow although not the bar maids fault. They have to cover everything in the bar area. I come here when I'm in town because it is a reasonably priced restaurant with decent food."}
{"text":"I'm a meatlover, like a hardcore meatlover, but for a reason I ignore, these days, I don't really like the concept of Steakhouse. I went there for my Birthday and one of the issue I have is the service. Yet cordial, waiter mistakend my meal with my mom's plate. Instead of doing place on the table, he just put the plate on the plate and ustensile which didn't really felt professional. I kind of get aggravated when I go to a restaurant and that a waiter just come for no reason online and say: Is everything alright. I want somebody that observe what I'm doing. Am I playing with my food, am I looking with discuss at my plate, is my glass empty? No to all those answers? then Leave me alone, I'm eating! In my opinion, this place is a wannabe The Keg, with a kind of fake-chic ambiance. Anyway I didn't really enjoy my experience at the Keg. The food was ok but nothing exceptional. I had the Tuna Filet, the cooking was ok but still, I asked for Blue and i reaceived a cold tuna inside. A well cook blue is tender, exterior is well cooked, and inside is lukewarm. So when you go to a steakhouse, you kind of except to have a good service on that. The salad was good, service soso, food Ok but no «wow» and it was pretty much the price of any other expensive steakhouse in town. 

The Keg is better, same price or almost. go there instead."}
{"text":"Went for first time with my family and everyone loved their meals except me! I ordered \"chicken parmigiana\" but I got cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan cheese.  I don't like to send food back to the kitchen after hearing stories from  people who work in restaurants so I ate some of the chicken but was not impressed!  I didn't order \"chicken cheddar\", the Parmesan cheese is in the name, why change the recipe and not the name? 
As I said before, everyone with me liked their food, so I will be going back, but will try something else."}
{"text":"I've been to Madison's several times, and I've always been satisfied with the food and service. 

The decor is very simple yet tasteful. The staff is accommodating and very efficient and present. They made sure we always had something to drink and wait times for our meal were very reasonable. I ordered the Madison's burger with house fries and a house salad with Italian dressing to start. They're Italian dressing is one like I have never tasted; I can't explain it but it's so much more flavourful than regular Italian dressing, so no complaints here. Normally I order the Oriental chicken salad (which is uber delish), but I was in the mood for a burger, so I switched things up to avoid being boring and predictable. The burger was juicy and pretty good by my standards, but to be frank, nothing to write home about. For the price and being a chain though it works. Overall, I would recommend this place, especially for the service. I would suggest the spinach dip and Oriental chicken salad to those who are interested."}
