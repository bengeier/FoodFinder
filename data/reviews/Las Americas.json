{"text":"Authentic.   The word I would use first to describe this restaurant. Its food is so very close to the flavors found in Peru. This is not to say that Inka or Lima Limon are bad restuarants but the flavors I find are not as authentic as Las Americas. They have food for just about everyone there. Whenever I go the smell of the food brings me back to peru when I am on the beach with my late Grandfather.  Friendly  The word I would use to describe the staff. They are always so friendly and they are always around to ask you how everything is going. Other restaurants have that kind of service but I personally have found it hard to find service like that in that location.  The only con I would give it is its location. Because its location is on Sahara and Eastern it makes it hard for me to drive down there all the time because I live in the opposite direction from it."}
{"text":"The Aji Di Gallina is fabulous.  We had another dish that was beef in a red sauce but it was not as good as the Aji Di Gallina.  Creamy, spicy, comforting and tasty!  The server was very friendly and very attentive.  Big portions, lots of starch if you are hungry and nice atmosphere.  Will definitely return and try some of their grilled meats and yes, the Aji Di Gallina again..  It is that good."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food that is now my favorite dive spot. It's a little sketch when you walk in but the food is killer. The cook is friendly and even served us because we choose to sit and eat. Awesome place! Cheap food and the portions are huge. Warning the salsa is so good but packs some late heat so beware."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! They do not have a child's menu, but they cook whatever you tell them for the kids! I had the chicken nuggets, and I LOVED it! I definitely loved this place because my family was happy, and I was happy. The service is amazing, our server got us whatever we needed. I love it, and definitely recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Best place to eat great staff and awesome food we always enjoy being there great place thanks for the jalea grande yumm"}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST peruvian restuarant I've been to.  Our family came from out of town and after visiting the strip, we were tired and really hungry.  Peruvian food was all on our minds, and I'm so glad it was! My husband can't stop talking about their ceviche.  Keep doing what you're doing over there! It's fabulous! A diamond in the rough :)"}
{"text":"I had the ceviche mixto and it was off the hook.  It brought me right back to my travels in Peru.  Las Americas is off the beaten Vegas path but definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I Had the Lomo Saltado  and it was very good!! My companion AKA my daughter had the Fish Ceviche and she loved it.. She is hard to please when it comes to ceviche because she knows good ceviche.. Warniing: It is lime base like a real ceviche. The place is clean and not pretentious with pics of Peru on the walls. Service was fast and food came out within 15mins. Good off strip restaurant. Decently priced and good portions."}
{"text":"Service was good, food terrible, they need to change the frying oil, food taste like old oil and everything it's over fry."}
{"text":"Thr restaurant delivered the food with a complete dish missing that was paid for. The food was on the lower grade side of every Peruvian restaurant I've ever had food at. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious Peruvian food specially the \"pollo alas brazas\" not over priced."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some epic Peruvian food, look no further!  Stuck in a stripmall, you wouldn't imagine the delightful cuisine that awaits you inside.   The dishes are perfect for sharing, and the colors of eat dish are amazing, there's nothing chromatic about the food!   We recommend jaleo de mariscos, pescado a lo macho, ceviche mixto, lomo saltado. Do not forget to try Chicha morada and try icecream of Lucuma."}
{"text":"Everything I had have in this restaurant is delicious.  From sopas to bread... pandebono buñuelos arepas and desserts... I really recommend this restaurant if you would like to try some real good Colombian food"}
{"text":"Awesome smashed plantain beef avocado and sauce.  Cheap delicious lunch.   Loved this place.  Super friendly and relatable."}
{"text":"Great quick meal! I mostly think this place is amazing because they have REAL natural juices \"an agua o en leche\" made to order! I had the maracuya, which was great, but they had a good list going even guanabana. Also tried the chicken/cheese empanada, tasty. The older lady, who I'm guessing is owner Dña Amparo, was SUPER nice."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian ceviche I found in USA. I am Peruvian myself and I have been in USA for 15 years and in every city I have been I have tried the different Peruvian restaurants. The food at Las America's is one of the most authentic and well prepared Peruvian foods I have tried in USA. But they are u doubly best at ceviche. Other things are good- better than most restaurants, but not excellent as their ceviche. Ceviche is their specialty.  Vanessa"}
{"text":"My first time trying Colombian food, and it was amazing!  I went today, 02/18/15 during lunch, and had the arepa pollo (~$8), which was really good by itself...but when our waitress brought out their jalapeno sauce, and I added that...it was to die for!  My friend ordered something that looked like an open taco, which he loved too.  We did have to wait a bit (~25-30 mins) for our food, but our waitress told us that up front, since they make everything fresh, so we were ok with it....and for us, it was worth the wait.  Note that this is definitely a hole-in-the-wall, diner-esque place, not a fancy restaurant.  So if you're looking for atmosphere and ambiance...this is not the place.  But if you're looking for really good, fresh food at reasonable prices...definitely give it a try.  I will definitely be back!  PROS: Really great food, good prices CONS: Moderate wait time, no atmosphere"}
{"text":"It's the closest place to me for buñuelos y pandebonos so if I'm ever craving Colombian antojos I can get my fix from them but I have had a lot better. I wanted to get Colombian coffee and it was nothing like el pintado I'm used to getting at Colombian restaurants. It actually gave me the WORST stomachache the one time I ordered it. I bought the tamales for Christmas and it also didn't settle well. I will not be getting those anymore. I don't know what they do to their food but most of what I have bought there has not settled well with my stomach, and I realized it's not just me when I took a couple of people with me to eat and gave them the same effect. I wouldn't recommend las Americas. I gave them 2 stars because the service isn't too bad."}
{"text":"OK, I finally went over to Las Americas, and it's everything the other posters have said.  I had the shrimp tacos, and they were muy sabrosa.  A wonderful change from other local \"Mexican\" chain restaurants.  I'm amazed to find this hidden gem so close to home."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. I've had the vegetarian arepa and number 4 on the lunch menu. Both are phenomenal. The flan is the best i've ever had. Great service as well."}
{"text":"vivi en california mucho tiempo, soy mexicano y me encanta la comida peruana, pero creo q me acostumbre al sason de el restaurant peruano al que iva en los angeles, por eso pongo 3 estrellas"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place plenty of times with my family, Very good food and service. the lomo saltado is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. The bad: the service is very slow but very sincere and polite. A few tips to set your expectations and appreciate the good food. If you're in a hurry, don't come here. Ask for \"la cuenta\", while enjoying your meal, don't wait till the end. The good: the fruit drinks are fantastic and the variety of flavors make this a \"go to\" place. The empanadas are good, but not spectacular. The arepas are my weakness and the reason I return to this place. Lastly, the lunch specials are very good and well priced, offering homemade soups, well seasoned protein offerings, and the beans (lentils or frijoles) are always fresh and seasoned well. As a Colombian, I recognize the long wait for a menu, or your check, as a cultural issue for these small business owner. Just relax, enjoy the food, and if you're in a hurry .......don't be afraid to go to the counter and ask to pay for your meal. The smile, gratitude, and great food  you receive is worth your effort."}
{"text":"not many places that make me feel at home. All my comfort foods in one spot! family owned location with all your favorite treats inside. my favorite place to be on Saturday mornings!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the customer service left much to be desired; we walked in and we were greeted after 5-7mnts of been in there, then she took half our order and walked away for about 15mnts, came back with the few things we had order, we then paid and left with no desire to go back there. I was left confused as to why she did that... I told her we had many things to order, but she just left; I speak both Spanish and English so it was not a language problem, and up to this day I don't know why the customer service was so bad there."}
{"text":"I'm half peruvian half irish. I grew up with mom making the traditional peruvian dishes. I have to say most of the reviews are spot on. I ordered the papa la huaicana and Lomo saltado. Delicious . The sauce was perfectly spiced and the potion was nice. The Lomo saltado was very tender and nicely prepared with two diff types of onions and fresh tonatoes. Of all the peruvian restaurants I have eaten this one ranks in the top 3. A must try. You won't be sorry. Don't let the strip center it is in fool you."}
{"text":"The ckn was very tasty and fresh. Great value for $17 whole ckn with 2 large sides. Large space with friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo freaking goooooood!!!! I've  been to this plaza sooo many times and I've never even paid attention to this place. Like if you don't know it's there you would not know what it is nor pay attention to it either. I actually discovered it on yelp yesterday....and I'm so happy I did. But nevertheless this food was outstanding! I got chicken, steak, and shrimp tacos....my boyfriend got a chicken quesadilla with rice and a steak taco. All of that came up to 13 dollars. I was sooo impressed with the quality, quantity and the price. He said that was the best quesadilla he's ever had and I'd have to agree with him. Their food is amazing and I will be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great authentic mexican food this is the place. If you want atmosphere go elsewhere. The place looks like a dump but has absolutely the best Mexican food around. Worth going out of your way. I'm definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with our kids a few times . It is super low key as it is basically a Mexican grocery store with a small cafe in the back. Lots of fun things to purchase if you are into authentic Mexican and Latin American food. As for the cafe, it was good,but not the greatest ever. The service was good as were the prices . Maybe I did not order the right dish- had the beef fajita once and also some taco another time. They most tasted bland and not super savory. One of my kids ordered shrimp tacos and they were great. Also, the sides were very good as well- standard beans and rice. Like I said, good food, but maybe mine was not for me ."}
{"text":"My husband was raving about this place \"you gotta try their chicken!\" But honestly I thought it was mediocre. We ordered the beef heart to start but they never brought it out, the fries weren't even fresh, they use  frozen potatoes. I really wanted to like this place but it was just a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance or location fool you. I've gone to this restaurant several times. The food is pretty amazing. I always order lomo saltado for myself (steak stir fry with fries) because I love it! I've also tried other dishes though, the seafood appetizers, papa a la huancaina, the fried rice, the roasted chicken, I could go on and on, but I'd suggest trying it yourself. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Columbian food! This place was a hit with the entire family, down to our four year old. Great people that served us like we were apart of their family.  We had Bandeja Montañera, una arepa de pollo, una arepa vegetariana, tostones and el flan de coco. Everything had incredible flavors and was perfectly filling for our post-hike meal. We will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"So my husband is Peruvian. When his grandparents are out of town and they obviously can't cook for us, we like to stop by Las Americas to get in our fix.  I've traveled to Peru twice and have been eating the food for years, so I'm familiar with how it should taste. Las Americas does a great job with their recipes. The food really tastes authentic and makes you forget that you're still in the States. My favorite dishes here are aji de gallina and pollo a la brasa. I also drink about half my weight in chicha, which is a drink made of purple corn. It tastes like this weird iced tea, but it's sweet and delicious. My family has never complained about the food and this is a regular spot for all of us.  The ambiance of the restaurant is casual, yet a bit relaxing. The windows are blacked out, so the temperature always stays cool and the sun won't ever glare in your eyes. The restaurant also has large pictures of various regions of Peru, which is a beautiful sight and perfect for photo op's with your family.   Las Americas sometimes has live music on the weekends and they also serve picarones on Saturdays. They sell some Peruvian goodies like alfajores (my fave!), turron, Inka Kola, and they even sell custom cakes. The servers are always friendly. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Check out Dirty Dining before you come here. They were shut down because it was unsanitary and disgusting. I don't know why some people can't be clean, but I guess that's just the way it goes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Every person in my party tried different plates and they were all delicious. Every time we come to Vegas we will definitely be coming here to eat, and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for el pan de bono, the arepa was hard the filling had a good flavor but the arepa shell was like no good, hard as if the shell was made yesterday and left out it wasn't fresh, I order a guava and cheese pastry that it was ok, the guava had a low smoked flavor as if they almost burnt it and the cheese wasn't cream cheese it was one piece of cheese, I would lie if I said I didn't enjoy it, I did because is something you can't have every day,  I probably will comeback and try again, maybe today was a bad day to stop by!  But if you want my recommendation  stop by pan de bono ( the round one , no the ring) !!!"}
{"text":"Flan to die for.  Regular and the coco flan will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  The server is very attentive and professional!  They served us in less than 10 minutes the appetizers and our steak 5 minutes later! This is a must try and repeat!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place while visiting the city. Living in CA, I can find lots of Peruvian restaurants However, most of them tend to have the same dishes in their menu (lomo saltado, seco de cabrito, aji de gallina, tallarines verdes, causa, ceviche, etc). The first thing that caught my attention was the variety in the menu: Mondongo (tripe), patita con mani (beef feet), carapulcra, among others. I really recommend their tamales (Peruvian tamales are different to Mexican tamales). I ended up going twice during that trip just to try more dishes. I'm Peruvian, if it matters."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food in Las Vegas!!! We had to order 2 plates of lomo saltado, that was after we ordered 4 other dishes. The chicken is second to none. Pretty sure ill be coming back over and over"}
{"text":"Great Place!!! they have real Street Mexican food!! The chef can also make anything you ask for. Best thing about it is that on Saturdays they serve Peruvian food!!!! it's the only place in the Cleveland area that has to offer very good home Peruvian Cooking!! must try the Chicken on Saturdays among other  Peruvian Dishes they offer like Ceviche and Beef Seco!! I wish they served that on Sunday too. Hopefully they will. The market has a huge selection of latin products and also a brand new deli with a good selection of different meats. If you are Peruvian and live in Cleveland go see them at las Americas and ask for my causa Pancita Jr. he will take care of you!"}
{"text":"Great food, always consistent. We are regulars there. The only reason I don't give five stars is because the waitress never speaks directly to me when the family orders (in spanish). But, when it's time to pay the bill  is always placed next to me. Lol...the funny part is all of my inlaws know the owners. Anyway the food is great & we vist 2 - 4 times a month."}
{"text":"Food was good not doubt. But what concern me what the huge RAT I saw coming down from the chain in the corner of the restaurant next to the tv. I told the waitress they looked surprised but not much did. Sad to find a relatively good place to eat but infest of rats. The chief came out to check for the rat without?luck they just said the next door are renewing the infrastructure. But now I see failed the health hazard inspection make more sense to me. I think they might shut down too. Owner need to learn how important is handle food and their conditions of sanitizing.  Disappointed to see how a place with good prices and good flavor in TERRIBLES !!! conditions. Don't think I will stop ever in there since I saw the RAT."}
{"text":"The pollo a la brasa was juicy, good flavor and had crispy skin. All the elements that make the perfect Peruvian style chicken you can't duplicate at home. I think this and pho are the only things I won't even bother trying to make coz it's just not with the effort (time and money wise). The only thing I didn't like was the tub-o-fries that came with it. They were just the same old boring frozen shoestring variety, and having a ton of them didn't make them taste any better or make me feel like I got a great value. There was a shady street kid who walked in and took over one of the tables. He laid out a bunch of merchandise to sell to whoever was interested. Nikes, shampoo, lotion, and other beauty products. The fact that the staff didn't boot him out made me believe he must be a regular. So if you ever need chicken and hair products in one go, this is your spot."}
{"text":"First time here , Is very spacious, clean, services was great!!! The Food was delicious I will be back for sure to try more... I will definitely  recommend to check it out..."}
{"text":"This is a Colombian restaurant that serves great lunch specials $5.95.  My food was  a fish fillet, came with a side salad, green plantain soup (my husband had the lentil soup I thought that was better)  and tostones that were done perfectly.  They also have a small panaderia or bakery.  We got some coconut roll guava thing, an amazing guava mousse that looked like a custard (amazing) and pan de bono which is a Columbia bread made with cheese.  This was the best pan de bono I have had, however I have only tried three others.  3 stars because the food was cheap and good, décor is blah, but the owners were super nice. Bakery stuff was good :)"}
{"text":"My first time here, very impressed.  The grilled chicken is a must try for sure.  If you get there at around noon, they are coming off the grill and very full of flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent little bare bones establishment for a Latin American fix, with a Peruvian bent on Saturdays. Make sure to use the grocery store entrance on the opposite side of the strip mall, otherwise you'll be looking in sadly on a bunch of diners beyond a locked door. And to grab enough cash in advance.   If ambience, fine silverware, and style are your thing, Las Americas will not be your destination. But this trade-off is made in favor of authenticity, pride in cooking, and price, you'll be heartily rewarded.   I get the feeling that there's no \"method\" to ordering here. It's more of an aunty's house vibe where you grab a menu and sit wherever. But you do have to flag someone's attention to pick the menu items you want and of course, pay at the end. On Saturdays as previously mentioned, they have tilapia for Peruvian style ceviche, which is marinated in a sour bath of lemon-lime juice for maximum sour-packed punch. If you ask nicely (or bring a charming Peruvian lady with you), you can get other unlisted menu items like a Peruvian pesto pasta.   But like any good Latina aunty's house, they do NOT skimp on portions. The kitchen is just feet away from the dining area, so everything came out super fresh. And in contrast to the bland walls, the food came out full of color, clean of presentation. Our Ceviche Peruana was a heaping platter of fish and potatoes with Huancaina sauce. We also got three tacos (shrimp, al pastor, and carnitas), and an entree dish of shrimp and beef. Each taco came double wrapped in soft corn shells, onions, and cilantro, and a little bowl of hot sauce. The shrimp was my favorite of the tacos as the others could have used a little more seasoning. The other meats were juicy and tender, but I have to say we couldn't get over the Ceviche. And because we loved the Ceviche so much, we ended up just spooning the soup onto literally EVERYTHING. No shame.   For how full we got from just three dishes, it's amazing how little we paid. Less than Taylor Swift's new album paid. With those savings, you can go get yourself something nice from the store on your way out."}
{"text":"Yes, I loved it here!! Came here because this place was on review journal of last Friday. The pictures of the food made me want to come here so bad. I waited for the weekend to pass. I figured this place would be packed on the weekend because of the paper.  When I came here at 12:30 pm (Tue), there was just two groups of people. I was welcomed by the waitress, Maria. She was so pleasant and nice!! I asked what she recommends and she told me I should try their Lomo saltado. Yes, I knew!! The one that was on the paper!! I never tried Lomo saltado before but it was so delicious. The beef was lean and tender, the onion slices were crisp and the fries were so flavorful. The green spicy sauce she gave me was very good, too. I'm not sure what was in it, but it wasn't just green chili pepper sauce. It was spicy but mild. Maybe avocado was in it?? Review journal said the service was slow, but when I was here the service was super fast and also attentive!! Oh, snap. I forgot to try their flan (My favorite)!! Good for large groups."}
{"text":"I was happy when I discovered Las Americas! Some of the tastiest Colombian food I've ever had and excellent service. It's nothing fancy, and you see a lot of regulars and locals coming in and out to grab their items from the bakery, too. I ordered the bandeja paisa and it was perfect. The portions are rather large (like most Latin American restaurants) so the prices are great. You can easily split one plate for two meals."}
{"text":"It took me several months to return to this little family run restaurant/bakery tucked away behind K&W Cafeteria located at Tower Place Shopping Center in Pineville. Although it occupies a space in which several other restaurants have failed, I believe that, based on the bustling crowd the morning that my wife and I had a late breakfast there, it is going to be a long term success.  Until this meal, I had no real experience with Colombian food and the fact that we were the only non-Hispanic customers in the packed little dining area only added to our experience. We had the thin steak with onions and peppers and a ham and cheese omelette. Both were prepared perfectly, were savory and very affordable. The accompanying bread however was lackluster which was a little surprising  considering their excellent bakery items. Speaking of which, we also tried their homemade cheese buns at $1.25 each and had the Tres Leches Flan (yes, for breakfast dessert) for $3.50, all of which were tasty.   The coffee, Colombian of course, was good however it was quite disappointing not having real cream. In fact it was the small things that were the most disappointing, such as serving margarine instead of butter with the bread and regular milk instead of cream with the coffee. We also did not know whether to be seated  or stand in line upon arrival however none of that will prevent us from returning.  The service was very friendly but a wee bit slow. The sanitary rating was a 95.5 and the entire restaurant was very clean but a little worn and appeared to be somewhat under construction. It's simpleness added to the experience in a way. We definitely plan to return for lunch and for more bakery items!"}
{"text":"I need to repeat that the new location is very nice on the inside and the outside. The experience changed a lot for the better for most people I'm sure. I kind of miss the mystery of the old restaurant, but the progress is impressive! Please stop in for lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed. They were cash only for a while, not sure if that changed. Might want to call before you go."}
{"text":"The ambience was ok, the food mediocre. The table cloths were dirty but the service was good.  Don't bother find another restaurant."}
{"text":"Im the kind who is always open to trying something new so when our friend suggested to try this place we were totally up for it.  I have never had Peruvian food and didn't know what I was looking at on the menu.  However they do have a description written in english so you can decipher it without a problem but then how do you know what is good?  Well, we each made two or three choices then ask the waitress and she had a definite favorite of them and went with what she said.  The nice thing about being a Yelper is having your friends hand you food off their plates to try.  The bad thing is I need to start working off some of this food!  So here is what we went with.  Tamal with sliced marinated onions and lime juice, the Masa was nice.  The boyfriend had Parihuela Peruvian Bouillabaisse a Seafood soup with fish, clams, shrimp,mussels and squid in a delicious beer broth.  He was happy and full.  Our friend had Saltado de Pollo Chicken sautéed with tomatoes and onions and french fries.  It had a rich hardy flavor extremely filling.  Sadly mine is not on the to go menu so I can only describe it without a name.  I had a Spaghetti made with a Basil and Cilantro sauce with a lean beef and fried plantains.  I really enjoyed it, similar to a pesto sauce only in Peruvian.  The experience all in all was good the food was good.  It is not a gourmet restaurant nor did I expect one, the food is huge in portions and the flavor is good.  The prices are a bit high but for the amount of food you get I guess it is fine.  The service was good I think she was not used to seeing many White and Asian people come in to try the food maybe a bit intimidated at first.  I really enjoyed my choice for my meal and glad to have tried it I may be back but unsure at this time.  I'm going to go eat my lunch now, guess what I'm having ;)..."}
{"text":"I must say I've been coming to this place since back when it was called \"el tumi\" (i was about 11 years old)! Me and my family have always missed getting pollo a la brasa ever since we left peru. so we got recommended to this place, their chicken here is as good as it gets. Ive been to other peruvian restaurants and none have a chicken like this one. The chicken is just delicious, and well seasoned and reminds me of back home. their ceviche is good also, as well as the arroz chaufa. The one thing that disappointed me was the anticuchos. but then again i have yet to go to a peruvian restaurant that serves a GOOD anticucho. I give this place 5 stars because of their chicken, and because the place itself is very authentic. I've seen the bussiness grow throughout all this time and i must say that this has to be one of the best peruvian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Ok.  So I have worked less than a mile from this place for almost two years and didn't know it was there.  It's cheap, with huge portions, and best of all, it taste great!  $5.50 for the biggest quesadilla Al Pastor I have ever seen, with a side of rice, hot sauce and sour cream.  I was hoping for a quick bite and what I found was a meal fit for Mexican royalty.  It's a dive...  It's cash only...  And I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I try to hesitate on 5 stars but I look at this, there is nothing they could have done better and the service was fast and very friendly and helpful. It's my fault I didn't get the name of the dish but you know what??? There's PICTURES of every single dish!! That helped me decide on 5 stars also because if you use Yelp like me, I have to order from pictures!! So check mine out.. the steak with eggs on it, rice, perfect plantains and DONT treat those carrots like they're decoration, that was my favorite!! Like dessert! It has slices of mango in here and with a passion fruit vinaigrette it was beautifully sweet. I can't wait to try everything!"}
{"text":"I love peruvian food, and I have to say this place is awesome. It used to be better, but ownership changed but it's still good. Delicious food. I recommend, Lomo saltado."}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty. Like another person said, don't judge a book by its cover. It's not huge or fancy. It's simply a local joint that is not trashy, or dirty, and serves really good food. I say all this because some people have to have exotic this and that...oh and some refuse to eat in strip malls. Maaaaan please, don't ....more food for me. Moving forward, the wait staff was great...my family and I were greeted when we came in and we did not have to wait a century to be waited on. You are going to pay $10-$13 bucks for food but listen, don't freak out. You aren't purchasing the ingredients or preparing the food which is freaking TASTY. Sheesh!That's how I think about it (((shrugged shoulders))). I'll be back..."}
{"text":"The food and baked goods are just delicious. The fruit juices remind me of the Caribbean. But the best thing is the people: so friendly, welcoming, and inviting. They'll approach you speaking Spanish, but don't be intimidated if you only speak English. Try something different: everything on the menu is there for a reason."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely nice people here. They were very helpful and answered all my questions. I got the beef empanadas (not amazing, but pretty good), the arepas con chicharones y queso (now this was freaking delicious), and the Bandeja Montanera. This entree was very good, and could easily feed 2-3 people. I also ordered an arepas con chorizo and arepas con montanera to go. I did not realize how big all the dishes were. We have food for a couple days at least. Also a piece of tres leches cake. All this was only $42 with tax! Literally could've fed a table of 5 people.."}
{"text":"I do not write reviews because I am super picky, but this place is amazing!!! It is simple, no non sense delicious food. The shrimp fajitas came out piping hot, sautéed with onions and peppers, and additional plate with beans and rice and a salad. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had outside of the SF Bay area!!   Went to the wrong entrance initially, you have to enter through the side of the building and walk through the market to the food counter in the back through the double doors. I ordered the chicken and steak Burrito the 1st one on the menu (the nice girl who took my order recommended it). I felt the weight in the bag but when I got home and opened the box I couldn't have been more surprised or pleased, the burrito was over a pound  in weight it was huge!! I've only gotten burritos like this in the Bay and am ecstatic that I now have a place to go to that' competes with the best, is local and not 3000 miles awayl!!!  Only thing I wish they had was a salsa bar. Man I'm gonna get fat real quick now gotta get another one by the end of the week!!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant's food will never be as good as my mother-in-law's Peruvian food, I must say it is the most authentic in Vegas. It is not an upscale location, but the food is the star. The service is always good. If you're looking for authenticity, then this is the place to visit and try. You might make it a regular place to visit like my hubby and I have!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pollo a la Brasa.  Prices are good.  service is also great!"}
{"text":"Great Latino food.  One of my new favorite places. The tacos are awesome and you can't beat  the chicken quesadilla and rice for $5.50.  The food is so good that I eat it before I realize I have not even taken a picture."}
{"text":"My favorite Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas. Friendly service, good prices and the food taste is very consistent. As a Peruvian this is as close as you can get to authentic Peruvian cuisine in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great grocery, deli and takeout. Never had a bad experience. Just note that this is a cash only place."}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had! Very reasonably priced. This is a hidden gem and more people should know about it! Highly recommend A++++"}
{"text":"Shady area but the best Peruvian food I've ever had. My favorite dish to get is Lomo Saltado and add a bunch of aji. There hasn't been anything on the menu that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"Las Americas, Colombian restaurant. Great atmosphere and amazing food, you need to try their empanadas, bunuelos, and of course their bandeja paisa. Even though my personal favorite has to be the \"Arepa Montanera con Pollo\". Great homemade taste with a Latin-American ambiance."}
{"text":"We had a catered lunch at work the other day. Everything was delicious! The empanada crispy outside,soft and flavorful inside. The beans were creamy,great seasoning.  Roasted chicken,plantains,yuca,roasted pork. Fantastic! I cant wait to visit the restaurant with my husband."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and had the pollo a la brasa. The chicken was pretty great but the fries needed a little salt. other than that great food. visiting from Cali and never had Peruvian food so we came here to try. if we get the chance again, I'd definitely come back and try more. Our waiter was super attentive as well. so A+ for service!"}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall place.  Its a glorious mess with the order counter and kitchen up front amid the coolers and then the back room is divided between a dining area and shelves of food.  Doesn't look like much of anything, but it the food is authentic and inexpensive.  I had two shrimp tacos, nicely griddled shrimp on soft corn tortillas with some cheese and onions; simple but very tasty.  The salsa they provide is really good, but very hot, so be careful.  I will be back to try more of the menu.  If you are in the area and feel like a bit of an adventure, give them a try."}
{"text":"Another poor excuse for a \"Colombian Bakery\" or Restaurant. One of the fundamental and key components of a bakery is \"CAFÉ CON LECHE\" (Café con leche is a Spanish coffee beverage consisting of strong and bold coffee mixed with scalded milk in approximately a 1:1 ratio.) Without the basics you cannot consider yourself a \"Colombian Bakery\" or even a latin bakery!   I can only assume they rely on inexperienced customers who wouldn't know authentic from inauthentic. As soon as I walked in I began scanning the area for a traditional expresso machine always found in Latin Bakeries! Once again the infamous American coffee pot was their version of \"café con leche\" , needless to say I left disappointed and confused.   How is it possible in ALL of Charlotte that no one makes authentic CAFÉ CON LECHE?"}
{"text":"Finally made to new larger location. Grocery area is HUGE with fresh meats. Food is just as good as before with the added great addition of always having guacamole available that wasn't the case at original location. The WOW item IMO is the RICE !! Sooo tender light & flavorful"}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had in my life.  Very affordable - service is great and fast also.  My boyfriend grew up in Bedford Heights and took me there - omg.  We live nearby and whenever we visit his parents I MUST STOP!  I order so much they know what I want when I enter.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Very satisfied, went here summer 2013. Food was nice well seasoned and spicy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The prices aren't bad compared to the other Peruvian places in Vegas. Waitress was very nice and attentive. Definitely coming back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Ricardo was an amazing help and super friendly guy. We ate Ceviche de Pescado,Lomo Saltado with some Yucca a la Huancaina. Absolutely fantastic and finished off lunch with Helado de Lucuma. Highly recommend and it is easy to find. I look forward to coming back in the near future:)"}
{"text":"La comida es deliciosa, y la atención excelente, recomendadisimo el tostón con chicharron, las almojabanas y el cafecito colombiano."}
{"text":"Love their food, but annoyed that it's 10:30AM and still not opened when the sign clearly says 10AM."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that I've had Colombian before but that's what is for lunch today. In a large strip plaza, Las Americas is over to the west side and has an easily identifiable store front. Big letters with their name.  I was offered a table and a few minutes later, brought a menu. The young lady pointed to the specials and I immediately chose one of those. Not long, a big bowl of black beans followed by a platter of food was placed before me.  Interesting combination of spiced ground beef, fried plantains, white rice and a cold side which I enjoyed thoroughly. I quite literally cleared the plate. Absolutely delicious and while not \"hot\" it was spicy with tasty flavor.  Big plate of food, less than $8. Another few bucks for a tip and I was on my way."}
{"text":"My favorite Colombian restaurant in Charlotte! Staff makes you feel at home and food is great. I always get a chicken empanada and bandeja paisa (no beans, they always make fun of me for taking the beans out lol) YUM! Always make sure to ask if they have churros, they are to die for. Omg my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I read someone's review complaining about the coffee...I understand their point of view but omg this place has so many different plates and desserts and they just complained about the coffee not being \"authentic\" I understand giving 1 star for bad coffee if this was a coffee shop but it's not! I mean, did they even try the food?! That's the entire point of going to a restaurant, eating food! Seriously this place is great, a definite must try for anyone looking for great Colombian food."}
{"text":"The place to come to in South Charlotte for authentic Colombian cuisine. Very reasonably priced, great selection of menu items, friendly service and the menu is bilingual so don't worry - you don't have to speak Spanish to enjoy a great Colombian meal.   I have had several different dishes from the menu and all have been exceptional.   Ask about the arepa montañera. Very good."}
{"text":"I had the meat and rice/beans.  It was the tacu tacu de lomo.  Very well prepared.  It was very delicious.   A lot of red onions but they were not overwhelming and gave the meat a great taste.   To be honest, it was a bit bland even with the onions.   There's also a red onion salad with tons of lemon flavor.  Luckily I love lemons.  Some may find it sour.  I will return and try other dishes.  The chicken looked good and I saw numerous people order it."}
{"text":"Wonderful. I love Peruvian food and there is no place to get it where I live.  I came here for lunch and was not disappointed. I ordered ceviche and lomo Saltado. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Authentic, Authentic, Authentic....and cheap.  Get over it...this place isn't fancy, doesn't look nice inside and you might have a hard time communicating with the workers...but if you want some authentic mexican then this is the place to go!  Order your food at the counter then check out the Mexican groceries that you can buy.  Once your food comes out get ready to enjoy some of the best tasting mexican in a while.  This place isn't about the experience its about the food.  Can't go wrong with anything here...tacos, burritos and fajitas.  Whatever your favorite dish is...get it here and you will be impressed!"}
{"text":"As one of a handful of Peruvian(-ish) restaurants in Las Vegas, this place was a semi-favorite of mine when I worked in the area. Now that I work and live further away, I come out here sparingly.  You see, I'm Peruvian. I mean, I was born there, but  was raised here. So my concept of Peruvian food has always been stuff that my mom cooked growing up. But one of the things my parents never cooked and we only had in restaurants was \"pollo a la brasa\" (rotisserie chicken) made the Peruvian way. So whenever my parents had a craving for this, they loaded us kiddos in the car and off we went to get pollo. I haven't been a kid for quite some time, but you'd be a fool if you thought I didn't get in my parents' car when I found out they were on their way to the Peruvian restaurant. They go for the chicken, which they think is the bees knees, I go for the Peruvian ceviche. You should also know that Peruvian ceviche is different than the Mexican variety. And I might be biased but I'm pretty sure the Peruvian version is better.   Anyway. The food here is ok. It's not at all something to scream about, though it is better than other Peruvian restaurants I've been to. The portions always seemed smallish to me, too. The service is ok, though I swear the guy who works there is ALWAYS there. I've gone on in different days/times and he's ALWAYS there!  The prices are fair for Peruvian cuisine, specially if you're just in to get chicken and fries and salad. If you upgrade to ceviche or lomo saltado (which is almost Peru's national dish) you'll be more in the Tony Roma's price range than the Applebee's range.   Will I return here? Yes. There are just too few Peruvian options to consider not coming here."}
{"text":"Our meals were delicious! The staff were super helpful, and very kind. We had the pan de Bono's, which were huge and fluffy, as well as the toston con pollo. Everything was delightfully flavorful. This is definitely my new go-to for Colombian fare in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Food is very bland. No refills on drinks. They grab pop from a cooler on the store side and you pay for each drink. Not a real restaurant per say. Ok for a quick bite. Taco bell tastes better!"}
{"text":"Had a quesadilla for my first visit-- completely packed with meat and came with Mexican rice. Filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here, in the beginning we didn't think much of his place, like someone already mentioned in a previous review, don't judge the book by the cover. The place is clean and simple, service is good and quick. The food was really good and tasty, I suggest you try their coconut flan  is out of this world delicious!! Yeah we will be back!! Oh the down side of this place, they don't have a liquor license."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover, por favor. This place is delicious! Tucked away in a South Charlotte shopping center, these ladies know how to pack a punch in your lunch! A small quaint restaurant that offers tres specials per day at a shockingly low price. The friendly employees offer their suggestion if you're struggling to pick a numero.  After going with the chicken breast special, they first brought out a mouth watering bowl of soup followed up quickly by the main dish. Sooo much food it's crazy! I managed to clear my plate and boy was it tasty, especially with their choices of spicy sauces. They are also a bakery with homemade baked specialties ... can't wait to try that delectables as well.  We will definitely be back to check the other daily especiales!"}
{"text":"Great food! Real authentic. This restaurant has great ambience. Prices seem pretty reasonable, there are a bunch of dishes I wanna try but for now it'll be my weekly lunch spot."}
{"text":"I was advised to check this place out from a local restaurant owner. Needless to say this is the spot for authentic Mexican food on the east side. Tacos and fajitas are on point, but make sure to bring cash since it's cash only. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Named after the bowl it is served in, the molcajete is becoming one of my favorite Latin dishes to eat.   The version served at Las Americas was a little different than I have had at other places. And it was only just ok. The biggest difference was the inclusion of a cheese quesadilla within the bowl and an above average amount of peppers. All of the meat was over cooked and chewy.   In a continuation of the theme, the meat and tortillas on their recommended carnitas taco was also pretty dry and bland.  The flavor profile of their molcajete worked well and it had the right mixture of cheese melted in with everything. Their serrano, jalapeño and bell peppers were all grilled very well and added a positive element to the meal. On the side, it came with lettuce, tomato, a whole sliced up avocado, rice and pinto beans.  Overall, nothing was amazing but I would potentially visit again in the future.   Also beware: even though they have credit card signs on their door, they only accept cash."}
{"text":"so I went to this place with a Peruvian friend of mine.    As a Summerlin resident, going to E. Sahara and Eastern is quite a trek, not to mention having to drive through sketchy part of town.    I am no expert of Peruvian food, but I must say that I DID like the food.  I had typical Peruvian cusine such as Ceviche Mixto, papa a la huancaina, choros a la chaleca, arroz chaufa, and aji de gallena.    I guess Peruvian food is sort of like Hawaiian food.  Melting pot of many cultures from the Spaniards, the indiginous people, and Asian immigrants.   It's quite out my way, so I can't imagine myself going there frequently, and I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the food as I have only had Pervucian food a couple of times, but I did like it.  It's certainly something slightly different from what I'm used to, and I'd have no hesitation returning should I happen to be in that par to town."}
{"text":"Recommended by a native Peruvian and I'm happy she did.  Great Peruvian food!  - The ceviche de pescado was perfect.  Tangy, spicy, smooth.  Just really nice - The whole chicken had so much flavor.  I'm not sure how you get that much flavor into the chicken (not just the skin), but they did and I loved it - The fried rice with everything (i.e., beef, chicken, seafood) was pretty good.  Lots of flavor and the seafood tasted very fresh - The fried steak had so much flavor for such a thin little steak and the juices that covered the fries made them irresistible  - Very friendly service"}
{"text":"Just had Peruvian breakfast, I had to wait 10 minutes before I could get a cup of coffee. Once I ordered, bread was provided and I had to wait 5 more minutes for butter to arrive. Chicharron was really fatty but did had good flavor, tamales were good. Just one waitress trying to please several customers."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was searching for a Pan De Bono that tastes authentic, and after trying a Pan De Bono with a Columbian friend, we were able to identify that Las Americas has the most authentic Pan De Bonos. I did a review on another place stating it was good, but this place definitely is MUCH BETTER!!! Try it, its good with sweet coffee."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall...but a good hole in the wall. The staff is generally very friendly and the food is generally great. It's always worth more than the money you paid for it and the price is excellent and affordable.  Their only downside is no food on Sundays. I'll gladly change the stars when this changes.   The quesadilla is the best."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Colombian restaurants in North Carolina and there's is really not that many, however the staff is so nice and attentive, the food tastes very authentic their empanadas where really good as well! To top it off their desserts are delicious ! I've attached a photo of my plate which was the bistec a caballo."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful the lomo saltado took me back to the flavors I  previously found in Peru . The service and price was top notch I recommend this place 100%  if you are in the mood for some good peruvian food"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. Beyond the food, the staff are so kind. It's a family run business, where everyone is happy to be there and the food is all made in house. I had the seafood (Pacifica?) Rice, and the tres leches flan, both were delicious. I usually don't order flan, because I find it so eggy. But this was ordered accidentally when I thought I was ordering tres leche. Boy, am I glad they brought this out... It's was the perfect dessert.   The empanadas here are delicious,... To the point that I'm not really sure what I have been eating (when I have ordered empanadas previously) before coming here. They also have this cheese bread (made in house, which is really good.)  My husband got the steak, which looks good, but I think my dish was much more authentic. The guanabana drink is a nice treat as well.   I will be back"}
{"text":"Came to visit family and was recommended to eat here.  Our family is Peruvian and the food was absolutely amazing!  I wish we had something this good in the SF Bay Area.  The service and prices were more than reasonable and the Lomo Saltado, Anticuchos, Papa a la Huancaina, and Inca Cola were great.  Two thumbs up!  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was here during June 2012. I came to Vegas and was really craving Peruvian Cebiche. Not being frrom Vegas I called to make sure that they would be open and for the location. Since they were really close to closing I decided to call for 2 Cebiche Mixtos'. The only thing I was disappointed as far as Cebiche was that they did not offer spice. I am not an expert in Peruvian food but I do know my Peruvian food.   Well, the waitress was really nice and allowed my group of 4 people to dine-in while she finish cleaning up, which I really appreciated! =]  What I order:  -Cebiche Misto: Really good (8/10) -Jalea: Eh (5/10- I do hate Jalea, I order it in accident, was drunk) - Chicha Morada: GREAT! It was really, really good, and the price for the pitcher was unbelievable (10/10)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm Peruvian, and I live in Chicago but was in Vegas so I was staying at the MGM grand with my husband and we wanted to eat ceviche and jalea (Peruvian dishes) we google Peruvian restaurants and came across this place, although it was a bit far from where we were staying at THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS AND THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT..we took the bus to get to the restaurant we got there and fast and it was pretty worth it. I would so go back to this Peruvian restaurant again!!! Food, service and everything was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Colombian family home cooked authentic breakfast! Empanadas run chicken, steak, cheese plain. Pan de bono are bread rolls made out of cheese. OMG. Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"The food was very flavorful and very authentic and oh so yummy!! It took them a little while to bring the food out. But you could tell it was because it was a truly Columbian home cooked meal. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been delicious. I especially recommend the ceviche and lomo saltado (seasoned beef loin with onions and tomatoes). The whole baked chicken is also great. Don't miss out on the lovely Peruvian wines they have behind the counter!"}
{"text":"New location just opened at Pineville. My husband and I visited because we always went to the location in south blvd and food was good. We ordered the daily special: soup was salty, we also ordered a separate order of \"chicarron\" and was pretty bad. They admitted the food they gave us was bad but still charged us for it. They told us that they just opened and not really prepared for it. If they are not prepared for good service or food, they shouldn't been opened. I'm giving a one star because of food and service was pretty bad. I wouldn't come back. If you like Colombian food I recommend los Paisas or Gil's kitchen"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is good, but the service is absolutely horrible. Went there with my Husband and son, after waiting a while for the server to take our order came the worst part. My plate came out first, my sons 10 minutes later and then my husbands 15 minutes after that. By that time I was done! They did the same to other tables so it wasn't just us. So if you want to eat in segments this is your place. And the waitress was unapologetic so they probably think this is acceptable."}
{"text":"This place is unreal.   Went in with a friend for a quick bite at lunch and it over delivered. I had never heard of Las Americas before and had never had Colombian food before. Apparently I had been missing out on a real gem. Great meal with a ton of flavor. Service was great too. Everything is fresh, homemade. This isn't a pace with stupid gimmicks. Las Americas just wanted to bring  authentic Colombian food to Charlotte.  Oh, I also ordered a juice to go and it was easily top 10 most refreshing things I have had in Charlotte. Would recommend 100% to someone who wants to have an awesome meal."}
{"text":"As good as Amelia's. Must try. You won't regret it. Welcoming and helpful. Delicious pastries. Lots of breakfast choices."}
{"text":"Note: CASH ONLY! Super delicious tacos-- authentic and with homemade salsa. The interior of the restaurant/store is very bare bones, but that's not why you're visiting. You're there for the awesome food at rock bottom prices. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The lunch menu is very good. I had one with  Chicken . Also the homemade flan and pudim is great . I came here because my work busy all tell me good thing about this place . I am happy I tried"}
{"text":"I love my country and its food. Peruvian food is hands down my favorite and Im very happy to see that its getting more and more popular throughout the world. And now, in Las Vegas.  There are a couple of options in town and Las Americas is one of the top ones that have its pros and cons.  Pros are simple: The food. It tastes awesome and portions are good. Im getting punched by Incas right and left when I take a bite of anything that I order. And I ordered everything  already..dont judge me. They have this hang over secret called \"Leche de tigre\" (means tiger milk but its not real tiger milk) it is very sour but its liquid cocaine for me.   The aji de gallina and carapulcra taste like heaven. See, Las Americas has some plates that other Peruvian restaurants don't dare to have .Very authentic dishes like Patita con Mani or chicharron breakfast. Every dish taste good and the presentation is good as well.  Price is also in the Pros department. Comparing between the other spots in town, this place is really affordable. With a very big menu you can chose to be budget conscious or just go all out on a gallore of Peruvian food indulgence.  Cons are a couple : Location. It is not located in the best side of town. Ive seen (and filmed) a couple of homeless people fights at the parking lot , had some people selling random things walking into the restaurant (and they let them) or just some ghetto /dangerous situations. If you took the bus , good for you, but I drive there and it is a little scary to leave your car outside. At least you can see your car through the windows.  Another thing I don't like is the decoration. It looks cheesy/ghetto.It makes me sad sometimes because it scares people out. Just doesn't look good. For example I was eating my delicious carapulcra on a MonteCarlo casino plate and im sure they are not part of the chain.I cant bring a group here because it just doesn't look good and even though the food is good , presence and location will murder the experience for a Peruvian food noob.  The chef is awesome. He cooks and checks on you while you are dining. For a small stablishment I think that was a pretty cool touch. The servers are nice. Always smiling and greeting; However they tend to forget things . Today they forgot two things on my order and refills were taking a while. I give them a B for effort and warmth but they could do better  Ride your LLama but leave your Drama when you get there!"}
{"text":"Me and my son were on our way to the DMV on Sahara ave. And wanted to find something quick to eat before the long DMV wait. All we saw was fast food and accidentally found Las Americas. At first we thought it was Mexican food. When we asked for tacos the woman smiled politely and said, no this is Peruvian food. Awesome!  So she recommended some things and it was EXCELLENT.  I am so glad we stopped there.  It was like almost as good as a mini vacation.  Decor was cute. Food was authentic and so delicious. The waitress was very very nice and even brought us sample drinks. Yum! I highly recommend a visit over there even if you don't live near.  Totally worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"ITS OPEN! After reading on Cleveland.com how to enter the restaurant, I was able make a successful entry. The entry is around the corner where the address is above the door.   The food was absolutely delightful. The tacos reminded me of the tacos that I had when I visited Mexico. Simple ingredients are allowed to be showcased in the dishes. They are not overladen with sauces & cheese.   My favorite item was the chicken quesadilla. The chicken was tender, plentiful. I wasn't going to eat the rice. I'm glad I change my mind. The rice was pleasantly seasoned.   I look forward to trying other items on the me"}
{"text":"I've never tried Colombian food before, but this turn out to be the best introduction ever. Based on how many \"local\" (Spanish-speaking people, I couldn't tell if all of them were Colombians, but you know what I mean) peoole were there, this place seemed very authentic. Arepa's prices seemed quite reasonable, but their entries were not on the cheapesr side - $13-15. But they were humongous.  I had a fish entry, and my hubbie had a steak entry with egg on top. The fish was insanely delicious, so was rice.  We've also tried Colombian \"pao de queso\"(cheese bread) - oh wow, so good. I'm so glad we've found this place."}
{"text":"Food is ok but ridiculously overpriced. I paid $11 for a \"sancocho de gallina\" during lunch hour - that is simply outrageous!! And I must agree the service is absolutely terrible. They take way too long to bring your food - they even take a very long time to bring you a menu. When my co-workers and I walked in today we basically waited a full 10 minutes to even be acknowledged (and there were only 2 other tables taken). Someone in my group had to actually get up grab some napkins and wipe our table as the 2 waitresses were simply ignoring us. Not sure what that was all about. I had not been to this restaurant in many, many months and now I remember why. NEVER going back there again. The food is simply ok (definitely NOT good enough to overlook everything else that is wrong with this place). If you want better Colombian food and GREAT service try Los Paisas (and no I have no affiliation to that restaurant - it's simply the truth)"}
