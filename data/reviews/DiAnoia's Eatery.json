{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about DiAnoias. My personal favorite time to go is lunch. You won't get a better sandwich and their bloody Mary's might be my favorite. I recommend getting a cold cut sub your first time and also their cauliflower and broccoli are incredible. Honestly you can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Visited last night for my birthday and it did not disappoint. We had a group of seven and tried practically everything! We tried several appetizers: the Escarole, Beans and Sausage and Cauliflower, ricotta, pine nuts and pesto being two of my favorites. For dinner I had the Tripoline pasta. Incredible. Buttery, with Parmesan cheese and roasted vegetables. I highly recommend. The night ended with Tiramisu and Zeppoles. Service was fantastic - attentive and knowledgeable. Ask for Nicole! 

Other items we ordered: 
Appetizers: Bread and oil, house marinaded olives, Mellon and Prosciutto
Entrees: Cacio e Pepe, Chanterelle Mushroom Carbonara, Squid ink spaghetti, Steak Florentine"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town for the night and drove around Strip District until we spotted this little gem. We sat outside and split a half carafe of Pinot Nero that was wonderful. (I'll leave the wine reviews to someone who knows what they're talking about). He got the gnocchi and I got the Cacio e Pepe (cooked to al dente perfection) both were amazing. 

A romantic little spot, sophisticated but not stuffy and not at all hokey like so many Italian restaurants. I can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh just so I can go again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on Friday night. Our third such visit. The decor is a bit weak, but the overall vibe is nice. Started with the Manhattan - just OK, too much bitters.

The beans and greens is phenomenal. Rich with layers of flavor. My fianc√© had the burrata, which was also very good. Both starters arrived quickly and the beans were nice and hot. 

Got the Steak Florentine next. The meat is probably not authentic to what they use in Italy, but still a nice cut. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Very delicious. The Roasted Potatoes are also great... crispy and rich. 

Our server Sam was great. Portions are fair for the price. Overall, this is a promising new spot. Plenty of good beers by the bottle as well."}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to the Strip. We went on a bustling Friday night. Reservations are recommended unless you sit at the bar. The food and cocktails were terrific. Very reasonably priced wines. We had cauliflower and brussel sprout appetizers. The cauliflower was wonderful, the brussels were ok (shredded like a cole slaw). Our entrees were cacia e pepe and the bronzino. Both we're delicious. Can't wait to return for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been there twice already since they opened. 

One night we had the Meat and Cheese platter (awesome, love the hard Italian cheeses) Ravioli, Gnocchi, and Steak Florentine. All were excellent. Ravioli is different than anything I have had in this city, and the steak was cooked perfectly. 

Highly recommend the AIA Vecchia 'Lagone', Tuscany 2013 wine. It's amazing and was a great recommendation from our waitress. 

Desserts were also good, a couple of cookies, cannoli, nice selection. 

The next time we went back we had the Steak Florentine again, and the Cacio E Pepe. Both were excellent again. 

Love this place - great addition to the Strip District."}
{"text":"Had been dying to go here and was slightly disappointed by the service. My husband and I sat at the bar and were looking directly into the kitchen. We ordered an appetizer with our drinks and ordered our entrees shortly after. 45
Minutes went by with no appetizer. My husband finally asked about it and the bartender shrugged then asked the chef to make it for us. Came out immediately. Another 35 minutes went by and we watched as everybody else's entrees walked past us from the kitchen. Finally ours arrived, as the stoves were turned off and they were cleaning the kitchen. I don't quite understand why we were deemed with the lowest priority and received our entrees last but it made us uncomfortable to watch them all clean while we scarfed down our food. We even wanted to order dessert but felt like the kitchen was now closed and we weren't allowed to. The food was absolutely outstanding. Their pasta is made in house and you can absolutely tell. But, for the price and service, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"A group tried this place out for early dinner and we had a great time. The service was superb from the welcome to the farewell. Loved the proseco on draft!!! The menu was varied enough to satisfy all of us, each with a different palette. Even the deserts were fun. Nice addition to the area-- I would visit again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and very authentic Italian.  Particular favorites are the cauliflower side dish, the bread (like a giant pizza dough), and Branzino.  Also, dont miss the Sunday brunch... very good!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for DiAnoia's to open and was excited to be a part of its first dinner service. The food was amazing. It is hard to decide what the highlight of the meal was, but I probably have to give the prize to the steak Florentine. Chef Dave is cutting the steak to order and cooking it simply with olive oil. The branzino crudo and cauliflower with ricotta, pine nuts and pesto were also delicious. I can't wait to go back for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food thoughtfully prepared in a light and fresh casual environment. The tripoline is excellent, and the escarole and beans appetizer was great. The stone fruit salad and house salad also earned rave reviews from our table. The only downside -- given the modern look and many hard surfaces, it can become quite loud in the restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great dinner we had! I highly recommend ordering the bread and cauliflower dish to start! My husband said the squid pasta is one of the best he has ever had. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We visited DiAnoias last weekend. Friendly and knowledgeable server. The bread service is ridiculously delicious and addictive. The squid ink and calamari pasta and the gnocchi and meatballs were delightful. I agree with a recent review that it is too bright and noisy for evening, but the food will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Our party ordered pasta and thought it was very good and lived up to being homemade. Highly recommend the prosciutto and melon salad. Dessert was excellent-the biscotti were rich-tasting. Definitely an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Been 3 times. Different times of day and days of the week. Each time coffee ran out. If they want to be called a \"caffee\", they should make sure they have some! Each time we had to tell staff coffee was needed....they should be monitoring. There are 2 containers....when one is empty, refill it! You pay in advance but if there is no coffee, too bad. Staff was unconcerned. Even after we had finished our meal....still no coffee made. Kinda wanted it with my meal.  We left without our prepaid coffee and no one offered a refund.  Just took my cup and never returned!
We live close by and had hoped this could be our new neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the area! I read an article about how the owners wanted to bring a New York/Long Island style deli to the burgh so I was very excited being that I am from Long Island. We went here today for breakfast bc I saw they have  breakfast sandwiches on kaiser rolls!! However I was disappointed that it wasn't the same type of soft kaiser roll I am used to seeing in NY- but it was still tasty. I got the pastry affagato which was delicious. Next time I'll come for dinner. Only suggestion is that the coffee is self serve for sugar and creamer, and it was only in one section by the bar/door. We ate in,so our drinks came served to our table but then we had to go back to the back to the bar area to add cream or sugar which was a little inconvenient carrying a hot heavy cup. Maybe add a self serve coffee table in the dining room area?"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous and I can't wait to come back!  We started with the crudo and then had the squid ink pasta and the gnocchi. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was melt in your mouth.  Looking forward to trying the brunch!"}
{"text":"Dianoia's is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The Florentine steak gets better each time I order it! The gnocchi dish is cooked to perfection and literally melts in your mouth. Finally got the chance to try their lunch pizza (topped with fresh Tomatoes and arugula)  this week and it did not disappoint. Absolutely delicious as always ! I appreciate this restaurant's commitment to fresh, homemade, and quality ingredients. You can tell this food is cooked with passion and love. I tell everyone I know to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic pasta and an all-around DELICIOUS meal.  Don't let the menu scare you... yes, many of the dishes' names are written in Italian - but, yes, you are eating at an Italian restaurant. ;)  It's makes it a nice experience in my opinion.  Plus, the description is in English and the staff was really helpful with making recommendations.  Cacio e Pepe translates to cheese and pepper - way less sexy in English.  It's a simple, traditional pasta dish and it's heavenly.  The only minor thing we didn't love was the noise - it was a little loud in the dining room, but that could have been an off night with loud patrons.  It didn't kill our conversation, but it wasn't soft and romantic.  

Bottom line: attentive service, bright atmosphere, and great food - we'll be back.  :)"}
{"text":"Was there for dinner and it was fantastic. Pasta is amazing. Service excellent.
Went for lunch and it was just okay. Serve yourself and very limited menu. 
Will definitely go back for dinner but not lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and could probably go every day. My favorite thing has been the veal Parmesan sandwich and it really might be the best hoagie in Pittsburgh. The pizza is absolutely top notch. Crispy, thin crust and the fresh basil finish just makes an all around great bite. The bar has a great drink menu, I am a fan of the negroni and the house wine on tap.  After we absolutely stuffed ourselves with pizza and hoagies, we were offered to try their home made cookies, of course they were also amazing!  The food here is so good that you're stuffed but you really don't want to stop eating. When you take the time to do things from scratch, the right way it really does show!"}
{"text":"My first yelp review because I've never left an  Italian restaurant hungry before.   I was surprised at the limited menu.   Admittedly I have simple tastes, but nothing appealed to me in the salads.   I was thinking a Caesar side salad but they don't have it.   I looked for an entree and was hoping for chicken parm or baked ziti, but they don't have it.   I settled on the gnocchi and meatballs.   It was good but the gnocchi wasn't nearly as hearty as I'd hoped for and there was no option for a side of pasta.   How is this possible in an Italian restaurant?  So I sat awhile and even looked at the menu again and was hoping for a slice or maybe even a small pizza because they were cooking them right in front of me and they smelled and looked really good,  but they're only available for carryout!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Creative menu with great atmosphere. Everything was super delicious. I got the gnocchi and they were melt in your mouth fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been excited to try Di Anoias since I heard it was opening, and it did not disappoint! I have tried their dinner and breakfast, and both meals were delicious. 

For breakfast, I had the egg sandwich and added sausage to it. You can add pretty much any meat you want to it if you would want something else. The sandwich was much larger than the average breakfast sandwich and was topped with a very runny egg and lots of cheese. 
My boyfriend ordered the breakfast pizza, which was loaded with egg, vegetables, and meats on a thin pizza crust. He also got the Italian donuts, which tasted like funnel cake, but very soft on the inside. Our favorite was probably the breakfast sandwich, but everything was good! 

My boyfriend also ordered the Calabrian mocha, which I do NOT recommend. It was so spicy that we couldn't even drink it. Cool concept, but just didn't work. They have a lot of coffee options that I am hoping will be better. 

For dinner, I had the half chicken and the house salad. The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I would highly recommend getting the half chicken and not the full, since it ended up lasting for 2 extra meals because there was so much to it. The house salad was the MVP of the night- the olives and oregano dressing made it the best salad I have ever had. 
My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi. The sauce was incredible. The meatball was a little over seasoned but still very good. This meal does not give you much though for the price. 

The atmosphere in Di Anoias is also wonderful. It's very open and bright and has very unique decor. 

Definitely recommend! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very upbeat and welcoming space in the Strip.  Comfortable and lively dining area and bar.
Every item we ordered was cooked to perfection.  The bread was fresh baked pizza dough with EVOO and parmesan  and was hot, chewy and amazing.
Gnocchi was pillow light with a fabulous red gravy paired with three fabulous meatballs.  My bride had the pasta with mussels and even though I am not a big fan of mussels, they were plump and perfectly cooked with a light flavorful sauce.  Escarole was the best I've ever had but could have had more greens with the sausage, beans and fennel.  I felt the portions were very ample and a great value.  Congratulations to Amy and her husband for creating a place we look forward to enjoying again and again!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday at 6 with gf. I made a reservation (although it had plenty of space, I was advised that it can easily fill up). Ambiance of the restaurant was cool and staff was super nice and gave great recommendations (Sonya). 

The reason I will be a repeat costumer was the food! My gf and I have both traveled to Italy and we both agree that this was the best gnocchi we have ever had! They are huge, fluffy pillows that melt in your mouth. The meatballs and sauce in the dish were also incredible! I know the menu may change, but if this is on the menu GET IT!

For dessert we split a brownie with nutella frosting. It was more like fudge. if you like dense brownies (like myself) this is also a great choice, and can easily be split."}
{"text":"Tasty food, excellent service. So glad to have a good, casual Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We had a family brunch, and we found the food and drinks very good, and the service excellant...

We will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Dianoia's, what happened?? Everyone raves about you and then...got a 1/2 Banzino and ended up with 1/4 of a Banzino with a tail piece--all skin and bone and breading. Swapped a side and ended up losing the other side. Other long time DiAnoia's diners at the table were dismayed at my plate. Off day? Hope so...."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful new addition to the Strip District. I came here with my brunch bunch and the staff were so accommodating and extremely nice and friendly. A lot of people in my party ordered bloody Mary's and you can tell the mix is homemade! I ordered a Garibaldi, which is OJ and Campari-wow-so refreshing!  I like how they set bottles of water on the tables so that staff is not constantly going around refilling water for everyone. I ordered the lemon and ricotta pancakes and these were delicious-I just wish there was a small amount of fruit on these as is the case with the panettone French toast. The savory bread pudding was really good too! Don't forget to order the zeppole as a starter! I will be back to try dinner as this menu looks just as great as the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Since my wife and I moved to Pittsburgh in 2016, this restaurant has been our favorite spot to relax and eat together. We move frequently for work and have lived in Hawaii, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Georgia. I have not found a place that compares to DiAnoia's. The food is beyond compare and the subtle changes to the menu throughout the year make coming back again and again too easy. My wife and I have eaten here pretty much once a month since we discovered the place and have never been disappointed. The chef/owner Dave and I met when he was first setting the place up, he was giving away the old furniture that the previous owners left behind, he and his friends helped load some heavy furniture in the back of my truck and told me to come back and eat some delicious, made from scratch food. They were not kidding, the food is phenomenal and deserves to be talked about. Also, the serving staff is always on it, especially our regular server Nicki! Also, this is my first and probably only yelp review, so that should say something. Enjoy and bring a friend!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome! The decor is simple but unique. It feels like you wondered into a cute restaurant in Italy. I don't remember our waitresses name, but she was lovely and happy to answer all of our menu questions. We ordered \"family style\" at her recommendation and it worked out perfect. Everything we tried was delicious. The \"house\" vino was a nice compliment to all of our dishes. And the cooked plate and dinner cocktails were also awesome. If you live in Pittsburgh or you're just visions, like wee were, I would highly recommend this restaurant. Big shout out to Aimee and Dave the owners. There are there and very involved in everything that is going on...making sure your experience is perfect!"}
{"text":"The food was great. You have to try their bread - which is less bread than a big pillow-y pizza dough looking disk covered in olive oil and parmesan cheese. You think you won't finish it - but you will - it's that light and airy and addictive.  

It was crazy busy while we were there and there (Saturday night 7pm) and there were a few large groups so the noise level was quite loud. And while our server was very nice and apologetic, the bartender was by herself behind the bar on a busy Saturday night and our waiter kept getting pulled back there to help - so our service was rather slow.  With as much exposure as this place has been getting - they simply need more than one bartender on a weekend night.  

BUT that being said, prices were good, food was good, portion sizes were spot-on and we liked the atmosphere... we'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was absolutely delicious....and the person who took my order was very nice!! I have been raving about my lunch since I came back to work. I will definitely be back!! I wish many many years or success...as long as you keep on taking pride in your food people will continue to come....it was that good."}
{"text":"Our sever was a nice young man but that's were it ended. Sat at table for 15 minutes before he came by, dropped off menus, he apologized for the delay and asked if we wanted drinks, I told him to give me few minutes to look at wine list to order a bottle. After another 15 minutes he returned took wine order and was gone for another 15 minutes or more only to tell me the wine I ordered was not in stock  and another apology. Selected another wine only to have server take the order then wait on 2 other tables as we sat for 20 more minutes without anything but water on our table, when finally bringing the second bottle ordered it was different vintage than on wine list and another apology. All awhile 4 other tables, some including our server, had sat after us, received drinks, appetizers and dinner. I don't understand how such a new restaurant would be out of the wine on the list, then serve a different vintage than what is on the list. I will say the food was very good but not at all worth the poor service."}
{"text":"I'm in the strip a few times per week for coffee and something quick for breakfast. Decided to try a new place. This was  several weeks ago when DiAnoia's had just opened.  Asked for a coffee that was 1/2 decaff, half regular but they 'don't do decaff' so the coffee option was out.  Ordered a breakfast sammich, while waiting a number of staff walked by me, no one even made eye contact, not very friendly for just opening.  Took my sammich to go, had to head to the suburbs for work.  Took a bit while still parked and an uncooked yolk exploded inside my SUV.  Never had a breakfast sammich to go like that.  Promptly cleaned up  and ditched the food, headed to my usual spot down the street.  May try them again, but I'm  in no hurry."}
{"text":"This place was really great! The area is cute and very simple. We went in a Sunday for brunch and it did not disappoint. We got the zeppoli and Nutella doughnut to start. The zeppoli reminded me of my childhood. My mom used to make the fried Italian doughnuts every summer for us when we were kids. They were soft, sweet and very VERY delicious. For breakfast my husband got the pizza of the day and I got the eggs benny. Neither disappointed. Our friends got the breakfast sandwich and the frittata. Great place and cannot wait to try dinner there!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say something bad so it wouldn't be so crowded. But luckily for the Pittsburgh dining community it was and continues to be spectacular. I can't recommend it highly enough!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!! We stopped here in a whim for lunch and with three children in tow. It is a bit casual and you can order at the counter and choose a seat after. The atmosphere is definitely Mediterranean and there is great artwork for sale on every wall. We ordered cappuccino for us adults, which were delicious. For lunch we order a Turkey sandwich with avocado and Italian bacon. It was fresh and delightful. We also ordered a meatball sandwich and pasta with meatballs for the kids. They cleaned their plates. I'm picky about meatballs and so are our kids and these were excellent homemade meatballs. We also ordered zeppoles for dessert, which are a classic Italian style doughnut and they were so good! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"What a great use of space. Nice coffee bar with deli in front of the house and spacious dining room with lots of natural light. Now on the food. Along with some friends. we went with great excitement to the first night they had dinner service, a soft opening of sorts. Re: we have know Chef Dave for years through his wizardry at Spoon. Super talented chef and equally nice man. Of course, the meal did not disappoint! We started with polpo (charred octopus), escarole/beans/sausage and tortellini for the table. Honestly, the only problem with this is the four of us all wanted to raise the serving bowls to drink in the broths from the escarole and tortellini dishes. Delicious!!! We then shared Branzino, spaghetti with bolognese sauce (special request) and Cinghiale. All were fantastic and this on their first night. The wine selection was more than adequate and it's especially nice you can get a half liter. The service was a little confused, as expected,
but very attentive."}
{"text":"DiAnoia's is consistently top notch. Have had a great brunch (3x) and now a great first dinner here. For brunch I highly suggest the breakfast sandwich add sausage or the lemon ricotta pancakes. Btw, great coffee.   

For dinner I loved the Bolognese - the amount of flavor packed in to this dish is incredible.  Also has the bread and cauliflower app. Both delicious. 

Great atmosphere and so cool it's a husband and wife team.  Really love what they are doing with this place.  See you again soon."}
{"text":"We went here last week after needing a change of pace from our usual dinner spots and what a lovely change of pace it was!  I loved the atmosphere and our pasta dishes were simple and delicious!  Our waitress was fabulous and friendly.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back to try more menu items.  I definitely recommend DiAnoias because they are doing it right!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with coworkers today.  Found it using the AroundMe app (Sorry Yelp...my buddy had his phone open before mine :( )  We all had sandwiches and everyone was pleased.  My Italiano was quite possibly the best italian sandwich i've ever had.  The quality of the meats on board the freshly baked in house roll may have had something to do with this [/sarcasm].  I will be back [/arnold]."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had the burrata crostini which was amazing, the greens & beans, also delish. I had the sausage pasta bake which was yummy and my friend had the gnocchi which she also said were delicious.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my husband. I wanted to love this place because I love Italian food, but we ran into a few problems. 

I ordered the eggs in purgatory (eggs in arrabbiata sauce with bread to soak up the sauce), and my husband ordered the veal parmesan. We also ordered some zeppole to share. 

Unfortunately, after ordering, it took over an hour to get our food! The waiter was apologetic and, after quite a while, brought us a cornetto (Italian croissant) to share while we waited. The cornetto, as it turns out, was delicious - no complaints about that. 

When we got our food, it was good, but nothing really wowed me. The veal in the veal parmesan was tasty, but the sauce and pasta served alongside it weren't anything special. The arrabbiata sauce with my eggs definitely had a lot of flavor, but the bread served with it seemed a bit stale. We finally got our zeppole after our main dishes. Some of them were perfect - sweet with a lemony kick, but a couple of them were definitely raw in the middle."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  The service was a little slow.  The atmosphere  was nice but VERY LOUD.  We were a party of 4 and we could not hear each other at our table.   Again the food was great."}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to this part of the Strip, which is somewhat of a food wasteland with the exception of Edgar's Tacos. We went for lunch today and the paninis we ordered were all excellent. The menu is extensive so I look for forward to going back and trying more things. 

The coffee bar is a nice addition to what is already a great menu selection, plus there is a beer case and other \"to go\" type things."}
{"text":"I reserved a table at DiAnoia's looking forward to trying the cacio e pepe considering I have not found any other restaurants in Pittsburgh that serve this dish. When I arrived, I enjoyed the decor and found the atmosphere pleasant. 
However, I was extremely disappointed when it came time to try the food. The cacio e pepe was essentially spaghetti (which came from a box) with a heaping of pecorino on top and a teaspoon of pepper-- extremely unauthentic and flavorless; even the pecorino was tasteless which speaks to the quality of the ingredients. 
Additionally, the other dishes I tried were just as disappointing. The texture of the gnocchi was fine, however the sauce tasted like pureed tomatoes from a can. I hoped that maybe the tiramisu would somewhat rectify the tragedies that were the main courses but, alas, it did not. The ladyfingers were not properly soaked and there was barely enough mascarpone to taste and, therefore, the tiramisu tasted more like desert than a dessert. The only dish that I somewhat enjoyed were the crispy brussels sprouts. 
Overall, I am very sad to say that I was extremely disappointed in DiAnoia's food, and that the quality v price of the restaurant is awful. If you would like authentic Italian food, you are better off following a recipe at home."}
{"text":"A charming new addition to the Strip. It has a small, but very unique, Italian menu. The dishes focus on home made pasta with regional specialities that are all winners. The use of lesser known ingredients like the Wild Boar Ragu are outstanding. We had dinner on their opening weekend and were thrilled. We plan to make many return visits for brunch and lunches."}
{"text":"My husband and I split two pasta dishes and they were both phenomenal. The gnocchi was so soft and perfectly cooked and the asparagus pasta was completely unexpected. We also split a bread appetizer which was also great. No complaints besides the high top table we sat at didn't line up right with the chairs, but I'd probably stand at the bar if that was the only option to have the food there again."}
{"text":"We finally tried DiAnoia's, and glad that we did.  The menu is well conceived, and the quality of ingredients proved to be exceptional. We appreciated that there weren't obnoxious portions, and especially appreciated the homemade pasta and bread.  Red sauce is very good, and I nearly never say that. Lots of love in the food.  The burrata antipasto was exceptional, even if the bread was a little too thick.  Our service was very good and friendly, and we appreciated how clean the restaurant was. The marble tables are not inviting, and I'd say the ambiance is on the cold side. The choice of wine glass is odd, and almost childlike.  It is an extremely small pour-definitely the smallest I've ever had at a restaurant.  At any rate, we wish them luck, and will be back to try many of the inviting menu choices.  Perhaps we'll go for brunch!"}
{"text":"DiAnoia's is hands down the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. The feeling I get when eating the gnocchi in the bread bowl is the same feeling I get when the Steelers win the Super Bowl. This place is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends.  Nice fresh vibe with a friendly wait staff. We ordered the famous gnocchi bread bowl as an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised. Lots of good flavors and perfect to share. For the rest of our meal we got a bunch of shareables. The items came out at a good pace. Waiter was attentive but not obtrusive."}
{"text":"Feasted on DiAnoia's for a week, post company party catering. Cheesy cauliflower goodness with pesto was insane. Perfect combo of garlic, spice, and cheese. Paired with the chicken parm to send you into cheesy Italian food coma. 

Aside from the carbs, an arugula, apples, pecan, and goat cheese salad was present. Lemon vinaigrette dressing rained down from the food heavens to seal the deal. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I was disappointed by the gnocchi bowl. However the service was by far more disappointing. Our waitress didn't explain anything. She was not accommodating, and basically the whole experience was a let down"}
{"text":"Very nice and fresh Italian restaurant. The squid ink pasta is delicious and the meat and cheese platter had so many great options on it. Honestly the prices are on the higher side for the portion sizes, but the service makes up for it."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening with my friendly 10 year old Pitbull, as their restaurant on yelp said it's pet friendly. 

I was greeted by a waiter that was rude when I asked him if outside seating was the only availability with a dog, and he said, \"I don't think so, but go inside before you take a table to make sure, since there's many more people ahead of you.\" 

So naturally, I can't go inside because I have my dog, and the restaurant was busy, but everyone was trying to eat inside, not out. But thankfully after a few minutes, another server told me to just go ahead and take the outside seating and they'd bring me a menu.

So just from that encounter, that's the reason for my rating. Now, the food was phenomenal and the rest of the staff was super friendly. Nikki my waitress was attentive and very excited to have a table that had a dog. Because of her and the service she provided, I may return.  The food I ordered was the cow cheek ravioli and the roasted Brussels sprouts. Both combinations were scrumptious!  Thank you Nikki for making my experience here better than it started off."}
{"text":"Amazing welcoming place with great real food  and lovely owners! On my top list 
Pasta / meatballs / porcheta/ cake and amazing cocktails"}
{"text":"Update: After a couple more visits and finally a visit for lunch, I'm bumping this up to 5 stars. Their paninis and pizza are both to die for."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS and adorable Italian restaurant! So authentic. The wine was so good as well as the dessert. Super recommend for date night!"}
{"text":"Everyone rants and raves about DiAnoias, so I could not wait to finally eat here. We had a table of 9 for my friends birthday. Unfortunately, I was not impressed and I am so disappointed that I didn't love it. I can not figure out why they serve warm water? All of the water containers on our table were room temp. It was 84 outside & the restaurant garage doors were open. Someone please give me a glass of ice water! The restaurant was SO loud we could not even hear one another speak, let alone hear what our server was saying. I was looking forward to hearing the weekend specials, but 8:00 Friday night, they were completely out of specials?  
To start, I got a house salad & it was really good but not worth the $9 price. For dinner, everyone at the table who got the gnocchi bread bowl loved it and I wish I would have gotten it. My husband had some kind of seafood pasta and enjoyed his meal, but it had hardly any meat. He was glad he added shrimp because without doing so, it would not have had much protein.  I got pappardelle pasta with homemade Italian sausage. I really wanted pasta with some kind of sausage, but there wasn't any on the menu. I asked the server and she they had sausage & that would be really good, so I got it. I should have known not to get something that wasn't on the menu. The noodles themselves were really good, but it came out with absolutely no sauce? Just a bowl of noodles and meat. I asked for red sauce and she brought me some but I didn't think the sauce was very good for being an Italian restaurant, it didn't have much flavor. I also didn't like that there wasn't any salt & pepper on the table. Then I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could find a server to ask for some Parmesan cheese since my pasta has absolutely none & I wasn't ordered any, which was disappointing. 
To finish, we had some cookies and coffee, espresso & cappuccinos. My cappuccino was excellent but the lemon cookie I had was so dry and tasteless. Really needed a glass of milk to wash the dryness of the cookie down. After 1 bite, I was done. 
Will I go back to DiAnoia's? Probably... I think I'll give it another try since others seemed to enjoy it but I don't think I'll be back with a large group due to the noise in the restaurant. I'd like to try it for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited DiAnoias this week for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. I had been wanting to try this place for the longest time. The weather Tuesday night was horrible but we were not letting that stop us. There was a good size crowd there at 630 when we arrived and the place completely filled up while we were there. It was a great atmosphere. We both ordered the perfect martini and it was really unique and tasty. 

Everything on the menu looked delicious so we both decide to order off the regular menu instead of the restaurant week special. We ordered the whipped ricotta appetizer which came with a couple slices of delicious bread. We ate the slices quick so the waiter brought us a plate with more which was great. For entrees I ordered the Cacio e Pepe and my sister got a pasta dish with red sauce and anchovies can't remember the name. We also got the side of cauliflower to share. Everything was really good and satisfying. We kept eating but still had so much left to take home which I always appreciate. Our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions. 

Overall our experience was excellent and I can't wait to go back. I especially want to try their brunch and pizza. I would definitely recommend DiAnoias to anyone looking for great Italian food down in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"One of those places where everything is good no matter what you order. The ambiance is what takes this place form 4 stars to 5"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The food was excellent and the waitress and hostess were both very kind and helpful with discussing potential vegan options on the menu. They actually have a homemade vegan pasta and it's delicious! They also make changes to the menu regularly, so there are frequently new options. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This weekend I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to go to this adorable Italian restaurant, located at the tail-end of the Strip District. Seeing that it was a beautiful Saturday night, my group and I were told that we had to wait for about an hour and a half to eat. We were far too excited to eat here, so we accepted the challenge. Tip: get a reservation, if you can. 

First, the atmosphere in this joint is impeccable. If you couldn't tell by the font on the sign, it has this vintage-yet-modern freshness that feels both fancy and dressed down. In the entrance, there is a beautiful coffee bar/delicatessen that functions primarily during the daylight hours, and to the side is a fancier dining room with eccentric pieces--like the glass-bottle chandeliers-- to offset the clean natural vibe given off by the natural wood tables and wicker chairs. 

Second, the food is EVEN MORE impeccable than the atmosphere. To start, we ordered the fresh bread with oil and cheese. It arrives at your table looking like a heaping bubble of hot dough, and when you pop the air bubble, it settles down to a warm pizza crust without the toppings. One word: life-changing. My friends and I were about to cry when we finished it, we just wanted more. 

When our entrees arrived, my friends ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the primavera. I can't speak for my friends, but their plates were clean within minutes, which made it seem like the gnocchi was to die for.  The primavera was delicious as well. I tend to like things spicier, so I added hot pepper flakes, but I would recommend more salt and pepper in this dish as well. The vegetable pairings in the dish were delicious. There were fava beans, some sort of larger root vegetable that I couldn't identify, and peas, among others. I especially enjoyed the peas, and the walnuts were an interesting flavor to add to the dish. I would eat this again for sure. In fact, I'm craving it as we speak. 

After dinner, my friend ordered the tiramisu while I went for the tri-color cookies-- an Italian staple to end the night. The rainbow cookies were not as soft as I remembered them to be, but nonetheless I gobbled it right up. My friend enjoyed her tiramisu, and her Snapchat friends were quite jealous when she added a picture of it to her story. 

Upon leaving this restaurant, I told every friend and family member I came in contact with to try this place immediately. I am here to tell you that you MUST as well. It was life changing."}
{"text":"We have been at DiAnoia's for breakfast when they were first opened and our experience were good ... but not great. Since then, we have heard raving review about their food so we decided to go have dinner. Got there on a Tuesday night 8:00 PM and the restaurant was 2/3 full and bustling. Numerous staff passed us but were too busy to acknowledge our presence. We finally got to the booth when the receptionist was.. She informed us that there is a 15 minute wait. With so many empty *clean* tables. At least 5-6 that we could see. We had to wait at the back of the deli area. After 15 or so minutes with ... we left."}
{"text":"This was an excellent dining experience. Fantastic waitress and every bit of food was super tasty. The burrata ravioli was amazing and so were the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"This is strictly a rating for how the kitchen mishandled my dish. The rest of the appetizers and other main dishes were amazing. 

Three guests of my party, including me, ordered the tripoline. The only difference between our dishes was that I had added chicken to mine. When the plates came out, immediately you could tell they were completely different pastas. The color of the sauce in mine was red and thick compared to the light pink and runny sauce in theirs. Additionally, there was no basil in my dish when the description of the pasta specifically has basil in it. Everyone at the table tasted the two to compare and we all agreed they were different. I informed the waiter who proceeded to give me an excuse about the seasoning of the chicken being responsible for the different flavor profile -_- anyhow, she took it back to the kitchen and 10 min later, I received the same thing I had returned, with half of it thrown out with the chicken, and basil tossed in.

I was hungry and didn't see the point in correcting them again since it was moot the first time so I ate whatever was on my plate, but I was disappointed in the level of service to correct their mistake. The actual tripoline was delicious and I'm jealous I didn't get the real deal. If you order it, DONT ADD CHICKEN."}
{"text":"I enjoyed an excellent meal and excellent service. The bread with olive oil and parm was a really great suprise ! I expected a basket of bread, but the pleasant suprise was a large piece of flatbread soaked in olive oil and with parm on it. It was light as air and delicious. The steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. One of the best steaks I've ever had! The cookies after diner were very good too!. Best of all our server Sam was excellent!!!!. He made the experience even better than the excellent food. I will be back, and highly recommend this place to everybody"}
{"text":"Very good food and good service. 
Wish they had a few more side dishes for the a la carte entrees. 
A bit brightly lit for dinner.
Will recommend to friends and will be back!"}
{"text":"Reservations a must! Disappointed too many times! The food is worth it tho! Service is hit or miss depending on the waiter... sometimes feel you need to be a hipster;)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh can always use more restaurants that serve truly authentic Italian cuisine and Di'Anoia's is here to do just that. My husband and I went for dinner during restaurant week so we were able to take advantage of both the fixed menu and the a la carte one. But first - the ambiance! I've been to Italy a number of times and Di'Anoia's would fit in perfectly with the any side-street restaurants in Rome. It's amazing that the space was an old bridal salon, because it feels as though it was meant to be a restaurant - not at all forced. There are chandeliers made of bottles and wine glasses, and the tables are perfectly boutique styles. I also have to mention our waiter (maybe Eric - I'm so bad with names!). He was perfectly attentive and nice. You could tell that he loved working there (you can always tell a lot about a restaurant by their staff). 
We first ordered the house wine (which is on tap) in a 3/4 bottle. You can definitely taste that it's from a tap, the first pour has that carbonated taste to it. Not a bad thing, just a bit strange. Served in an unlabeled bottle and with regular glasses, we felt transported into an Italian bistro right away. 
The meal came with delicious thinly sliced focaccia drizzled with olive oil and balsamic. We both ordered appetizers: I had the greens and beans, my husband had the brussel sprouts. The greens and beans were delicious, I definitely recommend! The brussel sprouts were very different than what we expected. I will admit that we didn't notice if there was a description to them, and we didn't ask when we ordered. They are served with an almond cream-like sauce - I would even go as far as comparing the sauce as a soup versus a sauce. It was good, not what we expected but still pretty tasty. 
Our main courses were really heavenly: my husband ordered the gnocchi and I had the tagliatelle. I like j gobbled up my tagliatelle in roughly 15 seconds (maybe a little longer). It was really authentic. The noodles were perfectly handmade. The gnocchi and meatballs (and that sauce!) were also incredible. 
For dessert, we shared the tiramisu. It was perfectly soaked and the espresso was delicious. I would definitely get it again. 
All in all, I can't wait to go again and try more on the menu. Reading other reviews, it sounds like breakfast is a must too! Looking forward to making our way back!"}
{"text":"Super delicious.  The staff is fun and the food is crazy good.  I am Italian and love legit Italian cuisine.  You will not be disappointed here.  Atmosphere is great, location is fun as well."}
{"text":"I wasn't even going to write a review about the terrible service we had Friday evening because the food was so delicious until we opened our left overs today and it wasn't our food.  I will first say, our server was extremely slow with everything, took about 30 minutes to receive our cocktail order once he arrived to the table. We ordered the meat and cheese plate to start, very good and a lot for two people to indulge. Our food came out shortly after, gnocchi, extra order of meatballs, and the squid ink pasta.  Everything was very delicious.  Our server never came to see how our food tasted, my husband and I sat with empty cocktail glasses our entire dinner (would have ordered 3+ more drinks if the server would have been around) we sat with our appetizer and plates of food for over 40 minutes until he came back to see if we wanted anything else.  The restaurant was not that busy for a Friday evening, I am not sure why we were forgotten about. Food I will give an A. Server doesn't deserve anything more than a D, at best.  Disappointed and was hoping for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"The P in Lauren P stands for Panetti: so very Italian and this place reminds me of my Grandma's and Great Aunt's cooking.  This is a bold statement but I have to say it is one of the most authentic Italian places in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is amazing and made with fresh ingredients.  I believe they have take-out pizza specials Monday through Thursday and even have breakfast pizzas on their Sunday brunch menu.  Speaking of brunch, I have been twice for Sunday brunch and it is fantastic. The menu has a nice mix of sweet and savory.  I started off with a mimosa which was delicious and served in a fun fancy glass. By the way the d√©cor is awesome and I love the color scheme (bright blue and green) with such cool glasses and plates.  I then tried one of their chocolate filled pastries which was to die for.  We also tried their pound cake filled with lemon goodness which tasted like it was straight from a little old Italian ladies kitchen. I had food envy of our friend who ordered the French toast and will be getting that next time.  If you don't save room for dessert, this is never a problem for me, you can buy their cookies and cakes and the deli counter in the front. The prices are reasonable, service is great and I can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Just might be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant after one trip! The ambiance of the restaurant alone is enough to make me go back- I definitely felt as if I stepped into a cafe in Italy. The coffee drinks and pastries are intriguing so I can't wait to try to those but I was there for a dinner. We didn't have reservations so we were lucky to snag one of the cafe tables by the door (would recommend making reservations to be in the dining room for future reference). We started with wine and the fresh bread with Parmesan. It's a pizza dough slathered in grated Parmesan and olive oil, it was good but I would rather fill up more on pasta next time. I ordered the Cacio de pepe as it was my favorite dish in Italy. It did not disappoint- I felt like I was back in Rome enjoying homemade pasta with a subtle but flavorful sauce. I would probably get this dish over and over and count on my dining partners to allow me to try a few bites of whichever pasta they ordered. I definitely don't think you can wrong and I would highly recommend bringing any Italian food loving friends here."}
{"text":"I've been to Dianoia's for brunch...first time for dinner. Same results: EXCELLENT food and services. 

I highly recommend the bread bowl gnocchi. I legit went in a trance when I took my first bite. 

Nicole was our server and she was very accommodating. 10 / 10!"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have had in Pgh. The risotto was crunchy and watery, a bad combo. Skip this place at all cost.

Reply: I should have stated I was there about a year ago and indeed risotto was on the menu and awful. I'm glad to see that you no longer serve it. I have not been back since that meal but hopefully things have improved."}
{"text":"Saw how good the brunch here looked on Instagram before the Facebook video about the gnocchi bread bowl went viral... so I was more compelled to try the brunch first and made a reservation for Sunday at 12PM. There seemed to be a lot of people so I was happy that I made a reservation beforehand. Come on a nice day because the natural lighting inside is on point! Their large windows really lighten up the place and their marble tables are great for insta pics.

I'm a big fan of Zeppole (and donuts in general) so of course we had to order. They were sooo good (just as I expected). And to my surprise they had a more lemony taste and a tad bit of salt, which was a good balance! It wasn't just a sweet donut but the pinch of saltiness made it enjoyable. 

I ordered the Prosciutto Eggs Benedict. I was recently introduced to prosciutto and was drawn to try this eggs benedict. It was delicious but the side potatoes were way too salty. It was a shame that I couldn't finish them all. The dishes my friends ordered all looked appealing and appetizing, except for one - the Lemon & Ricotta Pancakes. There were 3 that came out with maple syrup on the side and powdered sugar sprinkled on top. The pancakes are pretty much like pamela's hotcakes. Nothing too special about this one, but I expected a little more considering how the other dishes seemed to look more special to DiAnoias. 

Next time, I'd like to come back to see if the gnocchi bread bowl really lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I would never come here again. We visited with a large group of friends and they only allowed our group to purchase a tiered meal plan. This included an undisclosed 20% gratuity. Coming from a large Italian family the food was atrocious. The options that were given for the tiers may have been some of the worst food choices on the menu. No one was able to order any of the options they would have liked on the menu due to the only options of a family style dinner. Horrible prices. Horrible service. Horrible food. Go to a reputable Italian restaurant if you visit Pittsburgh. This is a poor attempt at food from a culture with a rich history in the area. Terrible."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this very simple.  EAT HERE.  Just do it.  Food, drinks, service all excellent."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but we had an extremely rude server who made off-putting comments about dietary restrictions that a member of our party had. I would certainly try the restaurant again, but if I were given the same server I would ask to be reseated. Enjoying a meal at this restaurant should not include being lectured by your server about your diet limitations. The experience left me feeling uncomfortable and annoyed; and ruined a dining experience which would have otherwise been lovely."}
{"text":"The Gnocchi in the bread bowl and the bread appetizer are great. The vibe with the all white is super cool. This is my first time but one of my favorite Italian places ever. The parking is great too right behind and on the street in front."}
{"text":"Live this place.   The beans and greens are one of my favorite things to eat in Pittsburgh.   I've had so many good things from diAnoia's.   What I can say, everything that I've had is top notch...food, drinks, service."}
{"text":"I do not have words to express how utterly thrilled I am with all of my experiences at D'Anoia's. The bread, pasta, homemade wine, service... everything is fantastic. The experience is on par with some of my favorite restaurants in Italy!"}
{"text":"10/10. Took a while for the food to come but at a place like this it's a good thing, the food is very filling so the time in between an appetizer like the bread with olive oil and a meal like the gnocchi was perfectly timed. I ate the gnocchi in literally 2 minutes though it was good and I was super hungry haha. The cauliflower and pine nuts was great, also had a glass of the house red blend wine which was very reasonably priced at 7.50 I think. It's available in multiple quantities made by the owners just down the street and brought over in huge barrels to be kept on draft. I enjoyed it. Save room for the \"doughnuts,\" I forget what the Italian name for them is but you get four fresh hot deep fried doughy little things covered in powdered sugar. While you're at it have a chai tea latte with your dessert, it's one of the most genuine chai lattes I've had. So good. Can't wait to try something new next time. Also I recommend making a reservation the place can get busy."}
{"text":"Gnocchi and meatballs to die for! Delicate pillows of gnocchi with super tender meatballs in a delicate tomato sauce. Delicious! Also sampled the grilled Charred Octopus with potatoes. To die for! Round that out with the Martini Perfecto and you have an amazing meal! 

Go there asap if you are in the area! Friendly service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place for lunch yesterday since we hadn't been there and it has gotten a lot of press.  Nice vibe and interesting space.  But I was underwhelmed by the \"House Wine\" that was served in a small kids cup like glass.  And the Porchetta sandwich was good but was heavy on the rapini but lacking in Pork.  Didn't really taste the Cherry Pepper Relish.   The meatball was good, but everyone has a favorite and this wasn't mine but was tasty.  The Cauliflower side was highly recommended but was really heavy and hard to finish since it was so thick. 

Overall we liked it but didn't love it."}
{"text":"I love DiAnoia's eatery and i have only tried three sandwiches. The prosciutto sandwich is AMAZING. It is the best sandwich i have had in my life. It has to be the bread that makes it but i could literally eat one every day. The inside is cute and everytime i go, there is good seating. I also love their lattes! I highly suggest giving this place a try, you wont regret!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place in Pgh. The menu looked great. Overall, it is a good place to try and I will return to try the deli and the pizza take-out. Dinner in the dining room was only okay. The pasta was well cooked in all dishes-- perfectly al dente. The broth of the tortellini en brodo was delicious. But, the lasagna was only so-so. The bechamel was not fully creamy and the ragu was not as rich or deep in flavor as I would expect (no comparison to the lasagna at piccolo forno). The cacio de pepe was so exciting to see on a menu and it is good. not amazing, but good. there could have been much more pepper and more pasta broth because the cheese/butter congealed quickly into no longer a sauce and no longer something enticing to eat (it was like the pepper pasta I could make at home). The most disappointing thing about the experience was the wine and the wine pour. Very skimpy pours of wine. My friend and I had 2 glasses each and both times the pours were not even. One time hers was much less than mine and the other time mine was much less than hers. But the pours were way less than a pour at most restaurants in Pgh and the price was too high for just an average wine. Also, although the service was friendly and prompt, there was no indication that the server actually wanted feedback except feedback that was positive. The one time we attempted to say one small critique about the lasagna, this seemed to create a situation where no more feedback was wanted. This restaurant has lots of potential, but I would encourage them to have comment cards and ask for feedback as much as possible and listen to the feedback. And, the wine pours alone would make me not return to this restaurant except for take-out."}
{"text":"What can I say? Where can I begin? How do I express how utterly amazing this food is?! Words fail. 
The food is great! The food is insane! The food is dreamy. We ordered an array of pasta and italian-y dishes that were devoured by my table. The staff was polite and helpful. Yes the waits were long. Yes they were crowded. Yes it was a little loud. I have only been once and have been JONESING for it every since, like some wild pasta junkie. Do yourself and your stomach a favor and at least try it out because you pass it by. It's definitely living up to the hype and their instagram is the bees knees. 
When I get more time I would like to go with just my SO and see how we feel in a smaller group. Things were clustered with so many of us there and it was hard to give it a fair shake."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Pittsburgh needed a genuine and authentic Italian place and this is it. This is the flavors of Italy but in a casual dining atmosphere with a reasonable price tag. It's something that you should be able to find in Bloomfield but can't. I've tried two pasta dishes (attached) and looking forward to returning for brunch soon! The gnocchi were amazing, the tomato sauce was fresh and delicious, and the pasta was made in house.

I would recommend checking their hours ahead of time because they're not opened all day everyday and closed for holidays. They're run like a smaller restaurant. 

Additionally, the desserts looked AMAZING but I didn't get to try them. The pasta filled me right up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it down on a beautiful, sunny Saturday morning. We got there for the tail end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch- perfect timing if you ask me! Began with zeppole,  an Aperol Spritz for me and an Americano for the husband. The Spritz was good would have liked some more bubbles in it though. The Zeppole were hot and delicious though. Perfection!
For lunch I had the roasted cauliflower and meatballs. Both were fantastic but the cauli was OUTSTANDING. Do not pass it up- that topping is everything. 
Husband had a prosciutto panini- it was huge and very good. After the zeppole he could only eat half, so the rest came home with us. Would love to come back for the evening atmosphere. 
First time was wonderful and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Brunch review after church on a Sunday! We had a 12:00PM reservation of four. Was actually quite busy during this time but cleared up after about an hour. There's really good natural lighting in here and their marble tables are sure to make for great food photos.

RICOTTA & LEMON PANCAKES ($10): Besides from it looking awfully dull compared to my peers' brunch picks, I should've asked for some sort of fruit topping like strawberries for a pop of color but I didn't think they'd serve me something that looked so sad :(. If you've had hot cakes from Pamela's, DiAnoia's pancakes are similar in thickness. They aren't super fluffy, but quite thin. Comes with a side of maple syrup of course. Meh.
ZEPPOLE ($6): Zeh-pole-ay? Zuh-pole? Anyway, this was yummy! Similar taste to the pancakes actually. Lemon-y and a slight salty taste? (in a good way!!) Try it for yourself!

SERVICE: Good good. However, our server didn't ask if we wanted to split our check and delayed us quite a bit trying to get his attention again. Nothing that would sway my next visit.

I felt as though my expectations were a bit high after seeing a hype video on Facebook of DiAnoia's gnocchi. If I'm to visit again, I'll be sure to order the gnocchi or their breakfast pizza."}
{"text":"So I'm conflicted about DiAnoia's. I want to like it. It's an interesting concept. First off, make reservations. We arrived at 6:45 for our 7pm reservation and was seated fairly promptly. Our table was right in the middle of the restaurant. For a Thursday evening, they were very full already. It is very, very noisy. Be prepared to speak a little louder than usual. Also be prepared to be patient. It took our waitress about 10-15 minutes to make her way to our table. 

She explained the menu and basics of how to order and a few of her favorite dishes. She did ask us if I was familiar with the internet because their gnocchi is well-known. Just an oddly phrased statement from the waitress. 

I took her suggestion with the tagliatelle and my husband came for the meatballs and gnocchi. We also ordered the bread and olive oil with Romano as an appetizer. Save yourself the $8 on the bread. It's pizza dough. There's not much too it including flavor. We didn't order any alcohol because the prices were quite steep. 

Close to 45 minutes later, the food arrived. It's all hand-made and anticipate the wait for the food. The lamb tagliatelle is something that you want to have a big bowl of on a cold winter's night. It has deep rich spices blended in with the lamb and the sauce. There's lots of rosemary, cinnamon, and all-spice that really develops the flavor of the dish. The gnocchi are very soft and pillowy in a delicious garlicky marinara. But....the meatballs had a lot of fennel in them. They needed more basic seasoning and a lot less fennel. 

The meal portions are fairly appropriate to the style and cost. We also ordered some cookies and coffee for desert. Coffee was delicious. The cookies resembled the consistency of a wooden shim or a doorstop. They were burnt on the bottom, dry, and hard. Truly a let down. 

Bottom line....it was okay. I wasn't over the moon. Nothing stood out or caused me to have a life-changing dinner moment. The waitress mostly left us alone. Parts of the meal were hit and miss. It's a welcome addition to the Strip District. Did I enjoy it? I guess. Do I need/want to go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at DiAnoia's Eatery!  We started with the burrata and figs as well as the fresh bread with Parmesan and olive oil.  The bread is TO DIE FOR and not to be missed.  I ordered the Cacio e Pepe and my husband had the Squid Ink Spaghetti and everything was delicious.  The dining area is absolutely lovely and we enjoyed our romantic dinner and the impeccable service.  Two foodies in from Texas thank you for a memorable meal!  

Go Pens! Go Steelers! Go Pirates!"}
{"text":"I'm into this place more and more. The prices are fair and the drinks are solid and also very fairly priced. 

There's nothing bad here. 

Great lighting, great atmosphere...just solid spot all the way round."}
{"text":"I am always so happy when I stop in here. Today I visited to lunch with a friend. It was busy, but the service is always great. They have garage doors that bring in lots of natural light. Such a beautiful place. 

Wen you walk in go straight up to the hostess table. It's near the cafe and bakery section. Read over the menu and then place your order. You can sit anywhere in the restaurant and they will bring it out to you. I had the sausage and peppers sandwich with provolone. It did not disappoint. The sandwich is so large I have left overs for dinner and I'm so happy about that! They have areas with boxes and water where you can help your self. 

Tip - they have a few parking spaces behind the restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian food right at home in Pittsburgh, this is your place! As someone who has been to Italy, I can honestly say that DiAnoia's makes the BEST gnocchi I have ever had -- they're perfect potato pillows of deliciousness, complemented by house-made meatballs, sauce, and the perfect amount of cheese.

Not only that, but the service here is always incredible. The staff is kind, and you can really tell that they enjoy providing such joy to people through food. I've been here for both brunch and dinners, and I've never found myself wanting for anything more. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cannot recommend DiAnoia's highly enough. The food is excellent and their homemade wine is wonderful. That should tell you enough right there. The atmosphere is thoughtful and comfortable (all be it, a little loud). It is a great place to bring guests/visitors too, being in the strip district!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! My husband and I are pretty critical and we both had awesome food and service. He got the infamous gnocchi bread bowl and it lived up to its reputation. We started with try bread plate. The kale salad was so light and flavorful! I will go back there for that salad alone. Husband had the beans and greens. Could of use it with out the sausage but great non the less. I had the asparagus tagliatelle. The light lemon citrus cream sauce with asparagus was amazing. You can tell the noodles are homemade and not out of a box. We finished with the tiramisu that this Italian girl was in heaven with. Our server Ashley was very knowledgeable with the food and wine recommendations. Atmosphere and music was perfect. I can not wait  to take guests back here and show them how great this place is. A real 5 star gem !"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is always super kind and efficient, and the place itself is bright and has a feel good vibe. The glassware, tableware etc are attractive, and well thought out. One of Pittsburgh's best restaurants."}
{"text":"I only went here for breakfast, so don't know anything about the lunch or dinner service yet. You order at the counter and go sit down and someone brings out your food. It wasn't really obvious to me at first how things worked though. It's a really small menu, only a few things. I went with a breakfast sandwich and a cappuccino. 

I thought that it seemed a little pricy just for what I ordered, but once the food came, I changed my mind. My sandwich was huge. It had prosciutto, egg and cheese and came on a hot buttery bun. It was so tasty. I never think about using prosciutto for breakfast sandwiches, but it tastes so much better than just bacon. I loved the coffee too.Definitely want to grab some more of that."}
{"text":"The food is definitely above average.  I would say very good for Italian food in America.  But I've been to Italy twice and this isn't quite as good.  So I'm going to be super critical of this place.  I went with my friend whose mother is from Italy and owns a house in Abruzzo.  She got the Gnocchi with meatballs.  First thing she said after tasting it was that the sauce was too sweet.  I tasted it too, didn't think it was too sweet, but her Italian trained tastebuds weren't impressed.  The gnocchi were the size, shape and consistency of marshmallows.  Spongy and light and different than any I have every had.  I did like them.  I got the pasta dish with sausage, pine nuts and raisins in chicken stock. Unfortunately, the pasta was under done.  It was hard and almost crunchy.  Needed another minute to cook.  The flavors were ok together, but it wasn't something I would get again. My Italian friend didn't seem to like it that much either. 

Then there is the whole pizza controversy.  I saw on their website that they had pizzas available for dinner on Tuesdays through Thursday to go.  I thought this was odd and asked about getting one for dinner.  The waiter said we could not order them to eat at our table, only to go.  I would have to come back for lunch if I wanted to eat one at my table or take one home and eat it cold.  It's eye-rolling policies like these that make you not want to come back at all.  However, we were able to order the $8 bread appetizer which was same pizza dough, olive oil and grated Parmesan. Which was we did and was pretty good.  My only complaint was that the middle of the bread was too thin and burnt while the outside was think and chewy. 

Overall it was a nice enough, but I asked my Italian friend what she would rate it and she said B minus, 3 stars.  I'm giving it 4 because you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into the food and it's 1000 time better than anything at Olive Garden.  The atmosphere is also great. We went on a warm May night with the garage doors open and our waiter was originally from Italy and his accent was charming.  It doesn't get much better than that for atmosphere.  I may come back during lunch or brunch, but won't make a huge effort."}
{"text":"Very good gnocchi!!!!! I got the regular gnocchi and my friend got the sorrentino style gnocchi without the bread bowl. Hers was more cheesy. The gnocchi itself is this light, fluffy, and large gnocchi. Definitely worth the price. The service was not very punctual but our waiter was very friendly. We were told we would get complimentary bread but we never got it. My other 2 friends got the Tripolino di Funghi and the duck tagliatelle which were also good but i likes the gnocchi the most. Other than that, it was great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Brunch in Pittsburgh. Convenient location and bright atmosphere in the Strip District. Reservations recommended on busy nights and Sunday mornings. I am a big fan of the lemon ricotta pizza but always kick myself for not ordering the breakfast pizza when it predictably arrives at a nearby table."}
{"text":"My sister and I went for brunch this past weekend! 

The Zepplo's = life changing!"}
{"text":"Let's get it out there right up front.  The service was really slow and not very good for our four top Saturday night dinner.  The food, however, was fantastic!  If they upped their service game, they would be hard to beat.  Our reservation was for 6:15 and we rolled out of there at 10:15.  Yep, four hours.  

Granted, we had a drink first, then some appetizers, dinner, and dessert with an after dinner drink so that's a few courses but we should have been out of there in three hours, tops.  The delays were around our waiter and the bar.  I'm not sure if he just wasn't picking up the bar order or the bar was backed up but, ugh.  Painfully long waits between \"waiter appears and takes order and pushes a wine bottle purchase\" and actually receiving said order - either food or drink.

We started with the crispy brussel sprouts that were OUTSTANDING.  I mean, best ever, we all agreed. The Caputo Brothers Whipped Ricotta with toasted hazelnuts and lemon was sort of bland to me but others really enjoyed it.  We would recommend that they provide at least four slices of the delicious dense bread they served it with.  It only comes with two slices and a huge bowl of the ricotta. The waiter brought more bread but then doused it in olive oil and balsamic so it wasn't good with the ricotta whip. The Escarole, Beans and Sausage could have used a ton more greens but the sausage was very tasty.  We ordered the cauliflower side but he forgot to bring it so we didn't try that. 

For entrees, two of us had the Lamb Bolognese over Tagliatelle which was tremendously flavored but arrived very lukewarm which was a shame because it was downright chilled by the time our partners gnocci dishes were served.  They really need to hold the order until it is all ready and keep the pasta under a warmer or something.  We all loved the gnocci - the one served in the bread bowl was richer with the added cheese and basil while the gnocci with the meatballs and red sauce was lighter and cleaner in taste.  Really excellent flavor and unusual density. 

We tried some of their cocktails and the big hit of the night was the absolutely fantastic Amaro New Fashioned which comes with two different Amaro's - Nonino and Nardini - raw cane sugar and burnt orange with cherry.  Oh. My. Gosh.  It was so good.  I was not familiar with Amaro's and was really intrigued with them.  Amaro is Italian for \"bitter\" and while these are bitter, they are also highly concentrated herbal liquors ranging in alcohol from 16-40%.  I highly recommend the New Fashioned and a sampling of the other Amaros they have to offer as an after dinner drink.

The dessert Zeppoles were warm and soft and simply delicious with out Amaro drinks.  We really enjoyed them to top off our meals.  

I was intrigued with the food so I looked up the chef and he was the chef at Spoon before he opened this place.  This restaurant opened in 2016 and is a truly welcome addition to the Strip District dining scene. We'll give it another go but with lower expectations on the service."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a wonderful atmosphere. Friendly staff, and pasta cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The atmosphere is adorable and the staff is friendly. Sunday brunch was delicious. There were a lot of coffee drink options. Overall, food and service were great!"}
{"text":"Bread and beans and greens were awesome. I had squid ink spaghetti and it was very good, a little spicy too!  Their list of Amarones was long (an after dinner drink/wine) and the one they suggested for me was full of flavor. My wife had gnocchi with meatballs, also very good. Great atmosphere, a little loud.  In a fun area of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. Very open and bright. Fun vibe. The Italian donuts are a can't miss way to start brunch."}
{"text":"This newly hidden gem is fantastic. I've had the pleasure of having lunch and a light breakfast. Both were nothing short of incredible. For lunch I had the porchetta panini... needless to say, it left me speechless. The bread had a great crunch, flavor and fluff to it. The olive oil pepper blend was phenomenal and had a great balance of spice and sweetness. As for breakfast, the zappole were airy, sweet and the finish with a hint of lemon were tremendous. If you haven't made it here yet, do yourself a favor and carve out some time to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I've now had the opportunity to sample both the lunch and dinner menus. For lunch I had the veal parm panini which was amazing. The panini had both veal and prosciutto as well as fresh mozzarella. The person I went with ordered the pizza with soppressata and they really enjoyed it. 

I went for dinner tonight and had the opportunity to try the gnocchi, which definitely lived up to the hype. They were soft and practically melted in my mouth. The marinara was also really good and the meatballs were a nice compliment to the meal. 

Overall, I have had two great experiences at this restaurant and the staff is super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Wow. Came here for dinner. Atmosphere is casual, well kept, not trying to be kewl. Service is excellent. Our table had the apple salad, crispy Brussels sprouts, and fresh bread to start. We then shared the Brazino, gnocchi, and Tr√≠polini di fung√≠. Each dish was absolutely delicious.

If you are looking for superb Italian cuisine, this is the place. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come for quite a while and DiAnoia's did not disappoint! 

First thing that makes the experience good is the free parking! It was nice not to have to stress about finding a spot. I had a reservation, so we were seated right away, but it was crowded without being packed so I think we would have been okay even without a reservation (this was 11:30 on a Sunday). 

We had a cute table right by the large windows. It was a good seat, and would have been even better if it was summer and the garage-type doors would be open. I will definitely come back in the warmer weather just for this. 

We shared the zeppoli as a starter and it was awesome! The donuts were really dense, but had a lemon zest that kept them from being too heavy. I definitely could have ordered like three of that for my meal. 

For breakfast I had the americano which was like the traditional breakfast. The eggs were good -- a tad undercooked but many people like them that way so I won't hold that against anyone. The potatoes were crispy and well seasoned. The pancetta was basically just thin bacon in a swirl -- good but nothing to blow my mind. What DID blow my mind was the bagel-bun. WOW -- sooo good. Like a dense bagel without the hole in the middle. Crispy but not crumby on the outside and super soft in the middle. Amazing. 

Service was a bit slow but our waiter was clearly running all over the place so no big deal! I'll definitely come back for brunch and to try dinner as well."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the strip. Everything is homemade. I've been here a few times and the last time, i had a homemade Italian sausage sandwich that was served on a nice fresh roll. They have an awesome selection of craft beers and they have wine on tap - very cool!  Can't wait for warmer weather to get the garage doors opened up!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere.  Dropped in between lunch and dinner serving times and the staff was very accommodating. I found an ingredient on the menu I have seen in no other restaurant: Lebanon balogna. I had it on an egg panini. The chef is from that town in PA. It was delicious, better than my Grandma's."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at this Italian flavored, hip, casual eatery was good.  By 11:30a tables were getting filled-up.  The brunch items all have Italian aspects to it, so if you like Italian, you will like DiAnoia's.  Its a pretty restaurant on the inside with art all over.  An Italian bakery to take something home too."}
{"text":"DiAnoia's remains one of my favorites! Since my first brunch post, I have returned 2 times for dinner and didn't know I could fall in love with it even more! Similar to my brunch visit, both times I came for dinner, I had amazing service from our waitresses. Their service has been the best that I have received in Pittsburgh in a long time!
Both dinner visits I split the escarole, beans, and sausage. This is a must!! It is unlike any beans and greens dish that I have ever had, super creamy and delicious. I will continue to get this dish each time I visit! Last night, I also tried the fresh bread and the cauliflower. Amazing! 
For entrees... no surprise.. I HAD to try the Gnocchi Sorrentina style. Best. Gnocchi. Ever. and the bread bowl doesn't hurt either! Chris and I shared this meal and there was still enough for us to bring home and have leftovers.  Last night, I had a new pasta dish that was recently added (I'm assuming for the summer menu). I don't remember the name but it was rigatoni with squash, lemon, pesto, and stracciantella (apparently some kind of amazing and delicious Italian cheese similar to burata) You guessed it.... simple, flavorful, and AMAZING! Looking forward to coming back again and again! Mangia!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, but we were little disappointed about the food. We are big Italian food fans, so comparing with some of other Italian restaurants that we have tried, this one is maybe average.  The Gnocchi is their favorite dish, flavor was good, but too much potato, it was too mushy, we ordered the sorrentina style, the bread taste really good with nice texture, but the gnocchi was just not.  I had the Spaghetti Del Mare, spaghetti was a little too hard for me (but some people may prefer), and not enough Lobster/crab meat to make it amazing. 
But the chilled asparagus soup, meat balls, and butter garlic scampi were great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place before spending an afternoon shopping in the Strip. We arrived around 1:00 and the place was still busy for lunch. We enjoyed our lunch. We both had a panini. Mine was their homemade sausage .. So good. My husband had the meatball which he said was very tasty. The bread reminded me of my grandmother's homemade bread. The food others order around us also looked delicious. We enjoyed our lunch and will definitely come again. We want to come back for dinner soon. Their dinner menu had a nice variety and their desserts looked awesome. This place is really cute. We needed a bistro like this in the Strip. You must give them a try ..."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience was wonderful. The decor was trendy and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. We made friends at the bar. The food was delicious. We started with the bread and oil. Wow! The house salad was beautifully done with a perfect vinaigrette dressing. All pasta is made in-house. I had the spaghetti vacuous, in a cheesy buttery sauce. It was perfect. My husband ordered the gnocchi. Twelve large pillows of potato dough, light and fluffy, served with three large meatballs that were delicious. In a savory marinara sauce. Heavenly! Dessert and coffee topped off this wonderful meal. We are already thinking about what to order on our next visit."}
{"text":"DiAnoias has the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life. I don't even typically like gnocchi that much, but their gnocchi is delicious. Little fluffy pillows of deliciousness. The *most* fluffy and light gnocchi I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The gnocchi I order is in a red and cream sauce and comes in a bread bowl. I have not asked about this in the past, but I wish I could order that type of gnocchi in a regular bowl and not pay an additional $10 for bread bowl. The bread bowl is good, but not always worth the calories. 

Anyway, besides the gnocchi *Sorrentina style, everything else I've ordered or tried has also been delightful. I've been to DiAnoia's for brunch and for dinner about four times total and I have never been disappointed with any of the food they serve. Eggs in purgatory with a side of perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes made my day last month. Every dinner I've had at DiAnoia's has ended with tiramisu AND this pine nut cake thing that is perfectly sweet. I recommend ordering both if you can.

The only two complaints I've had with DiAnoia's is that twice I've made a reservation and then waited a bit longer than anticipated in an awkward waiting area where there wasn't room to sit and everywhere I stood I felt I was in someone's way. Although, they have been super flexible and easy going with moving tables when possible and were very sweet when we ran very late last night in the snow storm.

Second complaint relates to the only male server that I have seen working. He was slower and less responsive than the other female servers I've interacted with. He was my server for brunch and we had multiple awkward moments where my friend and I had to flag him down for whatever reason and then waited a long time for whatever we asked for. That day the espresso machine had broken down after I ordered the Dirty Maple Chai. They asked if I would be okay with it being made with coffee and I agreed, but was a little disappointed at the $7 charge on the bill for the dirty soy chai made with coffee. 

DiAnoia's can also be loud because of the acoustics  in the dining room, but this has only bothered me on one occasion. I think the set up and vibe of the dining room makes this a great place for groups and celebratory dinners. 

Even with the amount of time I focused on the negatives in my review, DiAnoia's is wonderful and probably on my top ten of places I enjoy eating in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing. The cocktails were awesome. I had the Amaro Old Fashioned. High recommend. Extensive Amaro menu and a very educated bartender who was excellent at making recommendations and education. I believe his name was Sam. 

The food was awesome. Watching the open kitchen from the bar showed that every employee was engaged and working hard. They all seemed happy. Speaks volumes about this place. Nice work creating a great culture!

Food was excellent of course."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I liked the atmosphere, the food selections, the staff.  I did not have the gnocchi bowl but an entire table of women were having it!  Delicious food."}
{"text":"Best italian food in Pittsburgh outside of my grandmother's house..."}
{"text":"I just got back from a vacation to Italy and was seriously craving some delicious Italian food. I found this place online and decided to try it out for lunch. It was perfect! The atmosphere is great. The food is even better. It was a nice day so the garage doors were open giving it inside seating with an outside feel. A friend and I split the Brussels sprouts dish, asparagus salad and the meatball sandwich. It was all delicious and we could tell the ingredients were authentic Italian. I can't say it was better than the food in Italy but it was very close if not as good as the food on our trip! Will be coming back very soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I tried out DiAnoia's during the recent Restaurant Week and was pleasantly surprised.  We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we arrived.

In my personal opinion, it was pretty pricey/upscale.  I wasn't overwhelmed and don't feel the need to go back, but I definitely suggest trying it.  I had the Gnocchi and Meatballs and it tasted homemade.  There were eight members in my party and everyone enjoyed their meal.  It was difficult to pay at the end of the meal, however, because they wouldn't accept more than one credit card with a certain amount of people there.  I hope this changes at some point.

The restaurant was full, but the acoustics didn't make it feel overcrowded or loud. 

I think the only thing to keep in mind is that they close at 9PM during the week, so planning a late dinner isn't the best idea or you'll be the only ones left in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love DiAnoia's! I got the Cacio E Pepe and it was incredible - probably the best Italian in town, in my opinion. We also got the fresh bread as an appetizer, as well as a side of meatballs with out meal, and both were amazing as well. I highly suggest making a reservation because it is always busy. The staff is very friendly and just overall a great place for a great Italian meal."}
{"text":"Really I'd give this place 2.5 stars - I felt guilty just giving 2.

I REALLY wanted to love this place - it was good enough - just not a love connection for me.  It's a little too bright and a little too loud so I couldn't have a conversation with my hubby at our 2 top table without yelling it to him.  Also, we heard every boring word of the conversation (complete with f bombs) at the table next to us.

Crudo was excellent but I probably wouldn't get the octopus app again - I didn't expect it to be all chopped up and served cold but it was tasty enough.  I have to say the bread they served was awesome.  I got some lemon slices, squeezed it over the crudo and put it on the bead - deliciouso!  We ordered 2 glasses of the super Tuscan - one of the smallest pours I've ever seen for a glass that was not cheap so kinda bummed about that.  Hubby's half order of Branzino was good too.  I had super high hopes for  the gnocchi and meatballs-gnocchis I loved - were super fluffy - the meatballs just didn't do it for me - I was looking for the salt which was nowhere to be found on the table. 

Our server was nice but was also super busy so kind of a wait for our to go boxes and finally he just brought our check.  Oh well, I guess I didn't want dessert after all so we paid and left. 

Overall, I might try to give it another shot but it probably won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I adore this place! I've been here twice now and loved it both times. The service was warm and friendly and the food was delicious. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and actually made recommendations based on my likes (I hate when they just say everything is good, even if it is). All of our food was clearly made to order from fresh ingredients. I recommend reservations if you don't feel like waiting, especially on a weekend. Must try!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've had on this side of the Atlantic. Loved the homemade pasta - and the BREAD is the stuff of dreams..."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but great atmosphere, wonderful friendly wait staff and good food. The bread was amazing and the cauliflower side dish was wonderful. It got a little loud once the place started filling up but all around a great choice for Italian food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed...service poor had to ask 4 Bread  several times failed to deliver one of the guest salad & never offered desserts. We were a Party of 6 & all were equally let down with our experience. However the house salad was excellent."}
{"text":"The annual New Year's brunch took us to DiAnoia's.   I  really liked the decor that would be explained as European minimalism Old world italian.  With the open kitchen, coffee and small \"bakery\" area opposite the dining room, I did the layout.  Service was prompt and polite.  I ordered a bloody mary which had a very fresh tomato flavor.  I can't describe it as spicy or different or unique, it was real tomato-y.  I didn't love it or hate it.  it was a very interesting flavor or not flavor, i couldn't decide.  The coffee was amazing.  I ordered the Americana simple egg plate, nothing too fancy, but very well delivered.  We also ordered the Breakfast pizza which was covered in crab. This is a changing item so make sure that you get the info from your server.  I will go back and be more adventurous, but you can't go wrong with the basics there at DiAnoia's."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We went for dinner- closest thing I have tasted to Italy. So happy this is 5 minutes from our house- it will definitely be our spot to bring family & friends. The fact that we can support a local Pgh chef is another benefactor! Love the story behind the restaurant. Can't wait to try breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in the city!!  Food is amazing.  Service was spot on.  You have to try the Brussel Sprouts, gnocchi, beans and greens.  Heck, just try it all."}
{"text":"Food was really solidly delicious....had the octopus appetizer and done salad.   For entrees had the steak florentine (which did taste pretty authentic based on my single experience of steak florentine in Florence) but was quite tasty and cooked perfectly, as well as ravioli.   I honestly scoff at pasta places...until i realized what good pasta was...last night.  Service left a lot to be desired, from being encouraged to pick out a beer from a 'beer wall' which was a cooler of beer to telling us the dessert menu is on the other side of wall if we wanted to see it.  Little things like that grated on what was otherwise a great experience.  It's a young place, still working out its kinks.  The setup was simple and adorned with unassuming art (that one can purchase...for $$$$).   As for price, it's on par with other well-crafted Pittsburgh eateries, maybe slightly on high side for some entrees.  Maybe we'll be back!

{"text":"Seriously, this was one of the best dinners I've had in a long time. 5 stars for food and service and ambiance!  We had a myriad of dishes from the brussel sprouts to the pasta primavera. I loved the fact that the limoncello was homemade, and the biscotti was the almost the size of our water (wine bottle) I would run to this restaurant if you haven't been yet!  Food was orgasmic!"}
{"text":"Stumped for the perfect words to describe my stellar experience, I just now realized that this months-old review was never posted! No matter - I can still remember the smell of the zeppoles like it was yesterday. I don't have a drop of Italian blood and, to be completely honest, Italian food is not my first choice - BUT, DiAnoia's has me shouting \"mangia, mangia!\" I could eat there all day, every day, it's that good. My brunch bunch chose DiAnoia's for our monthly get together and we've been talking about it ever since. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which fed me all day long. Add in the zeppoles (donuts) and we were one happy bunch. In addition to the wonderful food, the staff at DiAnoia's make you feel right at home. If there isn't an Italian Nonna in the kitchen, color me surprised. Drop what you're doing, and go to DiAnoia's before you can't get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Pasta - Amazing! Desserts - Wow! This is a must try. 5 Star Italian Food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's good, and I'll try it again.

Given the hype this place received when it opened, I expected to be impressed, but we know what sometimes happens when we have high expectations...

I ordered a house salad and spaghetti and meatballs.  The salad is different - a good variety of leafy greens, some garbanzo beans, some little olives, grape tomatoes, cucumbers - all drizzled with a unique, house dressing.  It's a small salad, but it's very good.

Now the pasta dish...  The spaghetti noodles were chewy and quite good.  The sauce, however, was orange, a little sweet, and just not what I expected.

The meatballs (two per serving) were very good and larger than a golf-ball.  Combined with the rest of the dish, it was decent, but not great, not amazing.

I say some pizzas they were boxing up and they looked really good.  Next time, I'll go with the pizza.

Service was very nice, helpful, and friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch this past Sunday with a group of friends.  Let me start by saying how great the space is....bright, roomy...the perfect place for brunch.  The service is also excellent.  Our waitress was to the point but very good at her job and clearly was concerned about making sure that everything was perfect.   In terms of food, we started by sharing the Italian doughnuts and ricotta pancakes.  The doughnuts were fresh and tasty but nothing spectacular however the pancakes were excellent.  For my meal I ordered the frittata with stew meat, however, since they were out of beef they substituted crab.  It was tasty but a little too crabby/fishy in flavor than I would have liked.  My wife had the eggs with arbiatta sauce which I tried and thought were excellent.  I would love to come back here for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Lots of tasty looking things to try here! Coffee bar, beer, wine, even kombucha... Cold deli salads, cheeses, fresh pastas and gnocchi. Breakfast options include a breakfast pizza, and many others. Breakfast is served until 11 AM.

I tried the fried polenta panino which was a little spicy, but delicious. The bread was on the chewy side, but overall a satisfying sandwich. Next time, I'll probably split one with someone as they're on a bit large. They also have soups, salads, and pizzas.

Ample seating inside in a pleasant cafe style."}
{"text":"I was wavering between four and five stars, but the authenticity of the place and the hospitality of our server and management was what really did it for me! I have so much to say!

I went with for dinner with my boyfriend and another couple. As soon as we walked in, I was floored by the charming decor. Chandeliers made of glasses and bottles, a long, beautiful wooden table, a darling bar cart stocked with supplies. It felt welcoming and \"lived in\" but not messy or cramped. We started with the bread and oil - YUM! It tasted fresh but kind of smoky, in a good way. The house wine is served just like they do in Italy. It comes in a carafe and you enjoy it in small glasses. I love this - it filled me with nostalgia for my recent trip to Italy and I think it's a nice authentic touch.

For main dishes we had two orders of gnocchi with meatballs, the mussels and linguine, and the ravioli. The gnocchi and meatballs were absolutely delicious and the red sauce was SO fresh. I could pretty much drink the red sauce by the gallon. Luckily we saved a bit of bread to soak up the last bit when the gnocchi were gone!

The mussel and linguine dish was good, but not great. The mussels were cooked wonderfully, but the linguine just left a little to be desired. It was missing something - there wasn't much of a sauce to go with it. I believe the sauce was meant to be garlic and white wine, which would have been delicious if there were more flavor to it. I probably wouldn't order this again, but if I did, I would ask for extra garlic.

But the ravioli. SO GOOD YOU GUYS. They were obviously house made - two (maybe three?) huge ravioli cooked perfectly al dente with a beautiful egg yolk in the middle. Pair that with a truffle sauce and tons of yummy shrooms .... when you break into the ravioli, the egg cracks and creates the tastiest sauce EVER. My favorite dish at the table for sure.

The portion sizes are perfect. I think a lot of us are conditioned by restaurants such as the Olive Garden to believe that pasta dishes are supposed to come in dump-truck sized portions. DiAnoia's does it right - you can eat all of your pasta and still have room for dessert, which is great because their desserts are delicious! We decided to do four desserts so that we could try a variety of things. We ended up with a traditional tiramisu, cannoli, Nutella croissant, and a lemon raspberry tart. We each had our own favorite - mine being the tart. But they were all out of this world. I would honestly pop in just to grab a few of the tarts. They are so delicious!!

Our server was excellent - I forget his name but I know that he used to work at E2 and he totally rocks. A manager stopped by to check in as well, which was nice. Loved our dinner experience and I want to try it out for breakfast and lunch too! I am truly impressed by DiAnoia's and cannot wait to go back with my big Italian family!"}
{"text":"Gotta update (is it still an update if it's still 5 stars?) my brunch review after visiting DiAnoia's for dinner last night and having another phenomenal meal and experience... and I am really not ever one to choose to eat at Italian restaurants/rarely ever eat pasta.

After grabbing a drink at the bar, our reservation was ready and we were seated. We were lucky enough to have JP as our server again and he, to no surprise, took great care of us.  You can really tell the staff here enjoys the atmosphere and is proud of their level of service and quality of food and drinks they serve. JP, again, provided great recommendations and engaged with us in a fun, but not overbearing way.

We placed an order for the house salad and the escarole, beans and sausage to start and it was brought out with yummy bread. I would definitely recommend the beans and greens again, but would maybe try a different vegetable dish in place of the house salad - though it was fresh with olives, tomatoes, house Italian dressing and chick peas.  For my meal, I ordered the gnocchi with meatballs and he had the taglitelle agnello (pasta in a lamb bolognese sauce).  Our dishes came out piping hot and were literally mouth-watering good.  The pasta was fresh, cooked to perfection, not heavy at all and the gnocchi was so light and airy and delicious.  The flavor was absolutely perfect and I am so happy we both had leftovers to take home and enjoy again!!

We had another round of drinks while we ate and I ordered the martini perfecto and my date had a Peroni.  My martini was good, but not what I had expected.  I was looking for something along the lines of a more traditional dirty martini.  I am glad to have tried another cocktail off of the menu, but I probably would not order it again (just not my style).

Because we were there for a celebration dinner, and even after we declined, JP was nice enough to bring out what he told us was his favorite dessert - a cream-filled pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I highly suggest, regardless of how full you are, ordering this and devouring it there or taking it to go because it was the perfect end to a wonderful meal.

Truly one of the better places to eat in Pittsburgh and one of my new go-to recommendations to people that ask.  Thanks DiAnoias!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!! Simple classic Italian. I came in wanting the Ravioli but they changed their menu. I was disappointed at first because I had my heart set on it all day until I tried the most amazing squid ink pasta. Chili oil, garlic, parmesan, basil, and the most tender squid I have ever had. Simple yet so elegant. The service is always great and I can't get enough of the house red wine. Keep it coming. My boyfriend had the Vitello Pappardelle and we shared meatballs. Super delicious and comforting. All in all, another 5 star dinner."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and decided to try this place out and were utterly disappointed. 

Food is below average compared to other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their panini is overly seasoned and I can only taste the vinegar soaked bread. Their meatball is under seasoned and tastes bland. Their pasta is overcooked. 

Everything on the menu is on the pricier side, given the quality.

Service is below average. During our first visit, I have to walk over and grab a bottle of tap water myself as the waiting staff is not very attentive."}
{"text":"The gnocchi bread bowl is unbelievably good. However the service was bad. Our waitress kept disappearing on us whenever we wanted something. Also the tiramisu tasted like the chef zested a whole lemon into the darn thing. I would definitely recommend the food but probably just for take out rather than actually eating here."}
{"text":"I just recently went to DiAnoia's for the first time this past Sunday for Fathers Day brunch. Our family started off with the stuffed cornetti, Nutella panzerotti, and zeppole. All were absolutely delicious but my favorite was the zeppole- cooked to perfection they were warm and had a great lemon hint. 

The Bloody Mary was also different but delicious. It looked like they added olive oil which was a nice touch. 

My mom and I went with the special breakfast pizza. It had chickpeas, roasted peppers, some type of pesto, fresh porchetta and a runny egg. This was perfect. My brother got the steak Florentine and it is a huge portion but I think he licked the plate. My dad went with prosciutto eggs Benedict which he loved - it was the perfect size for him. My sister went with the veal Parmesan which tasted liked your great grandmother made it. Lastly, my sister in law went with the Americana, cooked perfectly and the potatoes had a nice crisp. 

Nicole, our waitress, was absolutely phenomenal. She was patient and knew how to describe the menu and give recommendations.  She even gave us a nice
Selection of dessert pastries at the end. 

I definitely recommend this venue and hope to go again soon."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and the eggs benedict were easily the best I've ever had and the side potatoes were amazing. The service was great, the hostess was very attentive during the wait. Will definitely be dining here again"}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite restaurant in the city, favorite place to take friends and family, favorite date night spot, favorite EVERYTHING.  I may only be half Italian, but I love DiAnoia's with my whole heart.  Every meal I have had here (and there have been many) has been spectacular and service is on par with places at a much higher price point.  

I almost always start off with the beans & greens (I believe they list it as escarole and sausage on the menu, but I call 'em like I see 'em)... soooo good!  The sausage is just spicy enough and the fresh bread they provide to the table is perfect for soaking up every last drop of the delicious broth.  I also really enjoy the crudo and whipped ricotta appetizers.  It's always so hard to choose, but I've never been disappointed with my decision.  They offer a side dish composed of cauliflower, pesto, and some other magical ingredients that is SO so good and can also double as an appetizer or even your meal!  

Portions are wonderful and quite honestly their prices are a steal for what you get! I love following them on Instagram to stay up on the latest menu items and it's never long after one of their posts before I make my way here again.  By far one of the best Italian eateries I've ever dined in, and I've been to Italy!  Even my aunt remarked how much my grandfather, born and raised in Italy, would have loved this place, right down to its gorgeous decor that makes you feel like you're on a European vacation.  

Mangia!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for Excellent pizza, fresh ingredients and food cooked fresh and hot. 
5 stars for the awesome atmosphere, casual and trendy. Friendly service. 
5stars for the dessert--snickerdoodle Nutella sandwich, Italian doughnuts (fried to order), and Calabrian Chile mocha. 

5 stars overall"}
{"text":"Subs are out of this world. Bread is amazing. Meatballs are to die for. And I haven't even tried the pizza yet"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great customer service, food, coffee and drinks! Breakfast is amazing too!"}
{"text":"The gnocchi at DiAnoia's is to die for, definitely the best I've ever had, and the meatballs with it were also great. The brussel sprouts are delicious, as was the Cacio e pepe. Also got the branzino which was underwhelming, not at all what i was expecting given the delicious food that led up to it. Just plain sauted fish, no sauce or even seasoning (that i could taste) added. The macaroon style cookies are very good, but the donut style pastry with cream filling was a little dry (the filling was good, just not enough of it). All in all, we loved some of what we had but were not impressed with the fish especially. I think the prices are high ($8 or $9 for bread?) but the quality is very good. I'd go back for the gnocchi (I had the regular, didn't spend an extra $11 for the bread bowl, which seems like overkill)."}
{"text":"Get the bread! Pastas are great and so is the breakfast pizza. I love the cacio e pepe! 

Great service too."}
{"text":"I am Italian, and I have a hard time finding an Italian restaurant that serves food I can't make better at home. DiAnoia's, however, is one such place. Legit burrata, crudo, hand turned pasta. Such a treat! I like the vibe...colorful and homey with pictures that can be found in every traditional Italian household. Reminds me of my long passed relatives. We had one kink in our meal progression where a few appetizers came out with our entrees leaving us to frantically eat everything so none would be cold. This was quickly remedied by the front of the house. She was extremely on point when I tried to tell her it wasn't a big deal saying \"no, this isn't the right way to do it.\" When you have accountable people in charge you know those things will smooth out over time. She brought us coffees and a platter of delicious dessert samplings that were not needed but much appreciated. DiAnoia's does not cut corners with ingredients or prep and put together some really exceptional authentic dishes!"}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of hype surrounding this place, and boy did it live up to it! Our server was Aaron and he was great! He really knew the menu and helped with our questions. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were delicious! The spices and sauce on it complemented them nicely. I had the risotto di vino rosso (risotto with veal) it was fantastic. The sauce was rich but not heavy and I had veal in every bite. My husband had the gnocchi sorrentina style and was extremely happy. The \"bread\" was actually their homemade pizza dough and it was light and flavorful. The sauce, cheese and homemade gnocchi were all so delicious. We finished off the meal with their home made tiramisu. Again, fantastic. Overall, if you love good authentic Italian food this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!
We went for dinner and honestly, we loved everything... and with this crowd, that is a tough feat. Almost impossible.
Try the meatballs- they are huge, but surprisingly, not dense or dry.
The pastas were all good, but our favorite was their summer pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and a light butter sauce. 

The service was impeccable. We never waited on our courses or drinks, even if being a busy Friday night. Everyone was friendly, and the place just simply has a good vibe. 
Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is. Looks a little like a diner from the outside but a great little Italian spot. Not easy to get a table but when you do, give knowing glances to the soon-to-be disappointed walk-ins. Fresh simple pasta, next time I'm going to get the WHOLE branzino. I know brussels sprouts are common but it's uncommonly good here. And next time I'm going to get the steak. It looks amazing. And yes I am getting two entrees."}
{"text":"Is a $20 pizza worth it? Yes. Every slice.

This is my pick for upscale lunch where we can take our toddler and put her in a high chair while we pretend we're still adults with lives that can go out and enjoy good meals. For what it's worth: she loved the mushrooms on the pizza.

Everything I've had there (breakfast sandwiches, cookies, that really cheesy cauliflower dish, and their huge lunch sandwiches) has been fantastic. I hope they have broken the \"wedding world\" building curse and will be in the Strip for years to come."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat to experience true Italian food.  Chef Dave is creative and knows how to deliver a great menu, great food and great service.  We made Brunch reservations for Father's Day!!!  Can't wait to bring the whole family."}
{"text":"We went to DiAnoia's for dinner. Get the gnocchi bowl and just accept it's likely at least 3,000 calories. It was amazing.

https://www.thrillist.com/eat/pittsburgh/dianoias-eatery-pittsburgh-gnocchi-bread-bowls

The service was pretty good. The bar list was beyond impressive for wines and liqueurs.

I had the tiramisu. It was good. I think Piccolo Forno has the best tiramisu, but this was good.

That gnocchi bowl though, it was so absurdly good. I feel like I need to fast (or run fast) and just eat that bowl each day."}
{"text":"Omg this place! I had been reading about it for some time before I had a chance to make it in and luckily it did not disappoint! 

We came for breakfast sandwiches before a quick food run in the strip. Our out of town guests were very impressed with the space and decor & I definitely was too! We sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by very friendly staff members.

We all ordered pretty basic breakfast sandwiches, but the options of meats to add was so good!!!! And such a refreshing change from all the other basic breakfast shops. 

I know after sampling breakfast that I need to make it back soon to have dinner. I already know I'll love it. I'm so happy to have them as a wonderful Italian food option in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"We ate at DiAnoia's on a Saturday night and our experience started off pretty rocky. I made a reservation earlier in the week and the only available options were 5:30 and 9:30. We opted for the 9:30 reservation and confirmed later in the week. When we arrived at about 9:40 (a little late, admittedly), our table was not yet ready. We were seated about 7 minutes later and were informed by the host that the kitchen closes at 10pm- in just 13 minutes. This was pretty aggravating to the entire table and is definitely something that should've been communicated when the reservation was made. Perhaps we would've taken the earlier seating to avoid being rushed. To make matters worse, by 9:58 our server had not yet come to take our order. Concerned that we would be unable to order, we went searching for our server to ensure we got our order in before the kitchen closed. 

We had the Spaghetti Limone with Shrimp and Gnocci with Meatballs. The gnocci dish was absolutely fantastic! The pasta and meatballs were fresh and homemade- altogether a great meal. The spaghetti dish was not nearly as good. The whole dish was very white and pretty bland- white spaghetti, white sauce, and white shrimp. It definitely could've used some vegetables, spice, and/or pancetta or something to add some flavor. The shrimp also seemed to have been frozen, not fresh. This is not what I would expect from a restaurant like DiAnoia's. This was also the server's recommendation, which was also disappointing. 

I had a Sorrento's Torch cocktail, which was very seasonal and delicious. 

Sadly, we were not offered any dessert and were just given our bill without being asked if we were interested. I suspect this was also due to our late reservation. Again, this should've been disclosed at the outset so we would've had the opportunity to choose the earlier reservation. 

The gnocci and beverages are the only reason this review has 3 stars. The service and spaghetti dish warranted 1 star."}

{"text":"This is one of the better Italian meals I've had downtown. Everything was super authentic and the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu offerings. Would highly recommend trying this if you're in the strip!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Best meal this year so far. We both got pasta dishes with Brussels sprouts )excellent side ). Nice vibrant atmosphere with friendly staff. Portions could have been a little bigger (pasta) but we are big eaters. Overall very very good and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh DiAnoia's...you are so delicious. I ordered the Tripoline pasta and the pasta was perfect and the sauce was so fresh with basil, tomatoes, burro, and parmigiana. The portion was also reasonable as well. Just enough to fill me up without being overboard and sending me home overstuffed because there was no way I was leaving any behind on the plate no matter how full I was...it was that good. The meatballs are also great here. Super flavorful and clearly freshly made. The gnocchi is GIANT...pillowy pieces of heaven. I really wish they included pizza on their dinner menu though...because I have had it before and it is also amazing."}
{"text":"I only stopped for an espresso because my passport lead me here. The atmosphere was great and so was my drink. I would love to come back for dinner or lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I had super high expectations for this spot. On a Sunday AM (Memorial Day weekend) our wait was around 30 minutes. The flavor of our food was great. There was just something missing. It looked super \"plain\" like there wasn't really much presentation. I'm glad I checked it out, food was good.. but probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back for brunch. 

Atmosphere - 5 star, SMALL! prob not great for big parties"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for date night and we were not disappointed.  We started off sharing the burrata crostini and I am literally still fantasizing about it.  Its perfectly salty and creamy and crunchy and if I could eat it every single day, I would.  For the main course, I got the gnocchi, which are legit the size of my fist.  Like I could take one home and use it as a pillow in my bed.  They are huge and puffy and fluffy and everything you could ever want in a potato pasta.  There wasn't too much sauce either, which I liked.  My boyfriend got the mussels and loved them.  We finished it all off with tiramisu which was, again, perfect.  Not too sweet and perfectly moist.  I cannot wait to go back for brunch and pizza."}
{"text":"A friend of mine lives around the corner from here, so I've found myself eating/drinking at DiAnoia's a lot recently.  Every experience has been excellent.  Brunch had a lovely variety.  Lunch is a delicious, no frills affair that allows you to order from the counter.  Every entree I've had at dinner has been flavorful, fresh, and well balances (particularly the gnocchi, it is what dreams are made of, get it if it's on the menu).  The space is crisp and clean, with great windows for people watching.  Only complaints: it does get very loud (lots of hard services that would benefit from some sound baffling), food is a bit pricey to make this a regular spot, and their draft selection is very limited."}
{"text":"I've had it all. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, after dinner drinks, family dinner... all of it great! Wonderful hosts and owners. It's not a must go place. It's a must go weekly place."}
{"text":"There's no to ways about it. The food at DiAnoia's is bomb! They have several no-meat options.. yay! We were here for Sunday brunch and the place was packed! No wonder they take reservations even for Sunday brunch. The lemon and ricotta pancakes were certainly the best pancakes I've eaten in a long time. My boyfriend ordered this dish which was basically a compressed-pie form of spaghetti, eggs and Parmesan which was fabulous! Highly recommended if you're super hungry coz it's heavy! The breakfast pizza looked amazing.. and actually so did most the dishes. We couldn't stop ogling at food on the tables around us while we waited for ours... which brings me to service. Now I don't know if it was an off day or  the fact that they were so busy, service really was a bit of a downer. We waited 15 mins for our drinks and despite that my boyfriend was served the wrong drink! He'd ordered an Irish coffee and he was served just regular coffee. My Bloody Mary (although really yummy) was missing the cheese it supposedly comes with. I was mildly miffed coz people who came after us had their food on their table way before us..while we still were waiting on drinks. They fixed my boyfriend's drink though..but charged us for the fix and we ended up paying $20 for an Irish coffee. I find it a bit annoying when an upscale busy restaurant doesn't put their customers first! Annyywho, I've ended up rating the place 4 stars though.. the food really is THAT good! Hopefully it was just an off day for service."}
{"text":"Expectations were high coming into this place, by both word of mouth from friends and Yelp reviews. We had a reservation at 12:15 pm on a Sunday for brunch. When we got there, we were told the party before us came late so we'd have to wait a bit to be seated. No big deal, my friends and I all work in the service industry and completely understood. However, it took like 45 minutes for us to finally be seated. Our server came over after about ten minutes and chatted for a second, then said she'd be back to take our drink orders and was gone before we could stop her to say we were ready. When she came back fifteen minutes later, we ordered everything all at once. I got a cappuccino that was so yummy and some chocolate biscotti. Not sure if they make it in-house (assuming they do) but it is DELICIOUS. Unfortunately it took us about an hour to get our appetizer and entree all at once. I'm happy I had the biscotti to tide me over. I got the ricotta and lemon pancakes and a side of the parmesan prosciutto bread pudding. Honestly, I could have just done with the bread pudding because of how dense it was, and it was incredible. The pancakes were okay, I guess I'm not used to the texture of a ricotta pancake, it was a little mushier than I would have preferred, but I passed it around and my friends enjoyed them! All in all, I would love to come back and give this place another try when it's not as busy. Food gets 4 stars, service gets 2.5."}
{"text":"First time here after some hype on social media and Dianoia's delivered. Definitely call and make reservations. I didn't, so we had to eat at the bar which wasn't ideal, but the bartender was super helpful and pleasant. My wife and I both got the gnocchi and they were outstanding. They are massive, you only get about 12 of them but with the size of them plus 2 DELICIOUS meatballs, you'll struggle to finish. Sauce was very fresh and light, a nice compliment to the gnocchi."}
{"text":"After four marvelous visits, I must say, we were sorely disappointed in the entree- veal over polenta.  The veal was pulled or shredded, cooked too long and lacking in any flavor.  While the polenta with parmigiano cheese was wonderful the veal was cold and plopped on top.  The polenta just couldn't save it!

The crispy Brussels sprouts with tallegio cheese were exceptional, as usual.  The home baked bread with whipped ricotta was lovely - we thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers.  

The waiter was apologetic and said \"when you come back you might try something else more flavorful.\"  Logically, why would you continue to serve such a bland dish?  All he can do is give the info to chef, we tipped him well because he was attentive.  They did buy us dessert - an array of cookies-that were delicious!

Perhaps sticking with pasta is the way to go...sad to have duck the potholes in the menu, especially when one knows not where they are."}
{"text":"The food was almost there. It seems if there was a little more effort it could have been better. Meatballs weren't anything to talk about. Cauliflower dish was just OK but the Pipe Rigate was gross! I dont plan on going back. PS. The pizza is only for lunch not dinner."}
{"text":"Very bland food.you could tell that they made pretty good quality did but it was very much lacking in flavor. I had the gnocchi and lasagna which had cinnamon or nutmeg in it which in not a fan of. The beans and greens were really good though. Go to another Italian restaurant you'll be happier"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for Sunday brunch.
We added on 2 people to the reservation, and they miraculously had a cancellation and upgraded us to a bigger table to fit 6! I got the Zeppole (Italian doughnuts), and they were soooo melt in your mouth delicious!! GET THE ZEPPOLE! I got the prosciutto benedict, and every aspect was perfect- potatoes, hollandaise sauce, and runny poached egg. The European breakfast is a fun charcuterie spread with meats and cheeses on a board. The breakfast pizza was fantastic too! The restaurant itself is so open and modern. Has a great, cool American take on Italian vibe. I love the giant open garage door window letting in so much natural light and fresh air. I highly recommend checking it out!!!

Parking tip- private lot was full so I parked at the Cork Factory Parking garage at 24th street. 0-2 hours $2, 4-6 hours $4. Walking around the strip district was a good activity after a big brunch."}
{"text":"The whole experience was amazing! From the staff to the food that we ate. The food was truly hand-made and the atmosphere was great! Definitely will be back and will tell all of my friends!"}
{"text":"First visit here. Went to brunch with a girlfriend. Everything went pretty smoothly. I have the Eggs Benedict and it was very delicious. Service wasn't the best (ex: took about 5 minutes for our server to greet us, people who brought the food out set my friends food in front of me and she got mine, and we didn't get any utensils). Nothing was a deal breaker, just something to work on. Ordered a cocktail and it tasted yummy. I would like to go back to try some pasta next time."}
{"text":"We ordered catering from DiAnoia's for our work party. We go the spaghetti & chicken parmesan, roasted potatoes, and a house salad. I was sadly disappointed. The hot food items were luke-warm at best, the chicken was dry, and not enough sauce for the spaghetti. It seemed like everything was made the day before and they just warmed it up."}
{"text":"Had the plain cheese pizza. THANK YOU. I have been looking for a pie like this in Pittsburgh and just about gave up.  THE BEST IN THE BURGH! Hands down. Must try."}
{"text":"Rarely do I find a restaurant that is able to combine a dining experience that combines friendly and efficient service with outstanding food. DiAnoia's did just that. My friends and I reserved a table for Saturday night.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  The server soon arrived at our table with a serving of focaccia and a willingness to answer any questions.  Throughout the evening, he was ready with suggestions that made it clear that he had experience with the items and would help us to find what worked for our tastes.  I was able to make a meal out of two sides--meatballs and a cauliflower dish that had pine nuts and ricotta cheese.  These surpassed my expectations.  My friends raved about the gnocchi.  The evening was capped with dessert and coffee.  

This is a restaurant that manages to combine a homey feel with sophistication.  I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch and was not disappointed! The only disappointment was that I was not able to try everything on the menu! Our sandwiches,  prosciutto and meatball, were so delicious! I can not wait to go back and try their dinner and brunch!!! Great addition to the strip district!!

Since my lunch experience, I have went back for brunch and dinner and I am now obsessed with this place!!! Everything at dinner from the cheese plate to the pasta to the tiramisu was to die for!!!! 

Brunch has to be my favorite! The eggs Benedict was the best I have ever had! The lemon ricotta pancakes were so light and fluffy and full of flavor and you can't beat the prices! I am bringing my whole family to brunch this Sunday just so they can experience the yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"I love this place! From the second you walk in, you are hooked. Not only is the food incredible, so is the service. Our waiter and the rest of the staff were very nice and super willing to help. We of course had the gnocchi bread bowl, but I have to say the meatballs and sauce were outstanding! As well as their version of greens and beans. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is on the other end of the strip District, it's worth the walk. The food is all made there, I don't think anything is from a  package, tasty fresh organic. They even make the bread there. They have a brussel sprout dish with a melted taleggio cheese and toasted almonds, it's incredible."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to visit DiAnoia's for awhile, so I went in with high expectations, and I was not disappointed.  First, let's start with the food and prices. There were 4 of us; we shared the appetizers and meals, and each had a couple drinks; we left with a $200 bill. Sounds like a lot of money, but we got a lot of food, it was all quality and the drinks were strong lol. For apps we split: the beans/sausage/greens, the meatballs, and the bread with olive oil and parm. It was all fantastic. The beans & greens weren't typical, in that they weren't in your standard broth; it was almost as if they had blended some of the beans to make a creamier sauce. It was a welcomed (and delicious) deviation from the standard. For the actual meals we each ordered: the puttanesca, risotto with veal shank, spaghetti al limone, and gnocchi Sorrentina style.  We also ordered the whole Branzino to share between all of us.  Across the board, everything was delicious and flavorful; truly homemade and authentic.  But the showstopper of the meal? Hands down, the Branzino.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The skin was crispy; the meat, flaky; and the accompaniments - garlicky roasted tomatoes and incredibly crispy potatoes - were perfect. When they brought it to the table, a couple of the surrounding tables looked over in awe. 

So, everything sounds great right? So why only  4 stars? A few little things.  The service was kind of slow.  Our reservations were at 5:00, the start of dinner service. We didn't leave until about 7:15. I didn't mind TOO much because we didn't have anywhere to be until 8:00 so we had time to burn, however, over 2 hours at a restaurant for a table of 4 is a bit long. Moving on... the food in general was a BIT on the salty side. It wasn't unpleasant by any means, and I'd rather it be a little over-seasoned rather than under, but I definitely found myself drinking extra water the following day haha. Lastly, the gnocchi served Sorrentina-style is a bit misleading.  The menu says the basic gnocchi is served with meatballs, and to upgrade it to Sorrentina style, which means it's served in a bread bowl, is an extra $10. No big deal, but where it gets a little misleading is when you choose to upgrade it to the bread bowl, the gnocchi doesn't come with meatballs.  To me, $10 extra for bread, minus the meat, seems...strange? Idk, maybe it's just me. 

All in all, our experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend it for some delicious Italian food. And I will definitely be back, especially to try brunch!"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars here.   We started at the bar with a round of wines.  The bartender was friendly and very knowledgeable.   She took the time to explain the nuances in some of the wine and offered samples to make sure we like what we were getting.   

Then it was off to the table.  The server there was mostly efficient, but I wouldn't have described him as welcoming or friendly.  He did answer questions and make suggestions, but I am pretty sure he never smiled once the entire time we were there.   The pace of service was a little slow at the end, but was good throughout.   We had several separate checks and he accommodated that without error or complaint.   

The food.   We sampled a whole bunch of different dishes.  The burrata raviolis, brussels sprouts, arrancini, cauliflower, whipped ricotta, fresh bread, and zeppoles were all absolutely delicious.   They also made great leftovers.  

Surprisingly, two of the more popular dishes according to Yelp got an \"eh\" from me - the gnocchi and the cacio e pepe.   The gnocchi was soft and pillowy, but it almost bore too much resemblance to mashed potatoes for me.   The cacio e pepe might just have been me.  It's not a go-to dish for me and this was no different.  

As far as value, I'd say the place is average.  The wine pours were pretty light, so I had to buy an extra glass to feel satisfied.   Also, while the fresh bread is pretty darned special, I didn't dig paying $8 for it.  I'd much rather have that built into their concept or at least reduced a bit.      

Overall, I'd go back and totally over-order to have some yummy leftovers."}
{"text":"True story: I almost have eaten at DiAnoia's three different times before tonight. The menu sounded good - but I was never hooked or in the 'mood' to stay. But tonight, we made reservations and went for it. 

Our reservation was for 6:15 - we arrived early at 6:00pm - our table was ready, so we got seated right away. To be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the decor of the restaurant. The bar and restaurant are separate. The restaurant is clean and a simple design. 

To start, we ordered a glass of wine. Their bottles are on average $55 or more- the first glass I ordered was a white wine for $9 - our waitress suggested it but I wasn't a fan. We ordered the bread and Brussel sprouts appetizer. Literally, the bread was pizza dough crust with olive oil. For $8 - it was good but not worth $8. The Brussel sprouts were good. Not worth $9. 

For my entree, I ordered the Gnocchi with Meatballs- the gnocchi was the best I've ever had. Simply delicious. The meatballs were good, but I prefer my mother's meatballs. It was expensive though $18. If you want the fancy bread bowl? Add additional $11 - no thanks. I also ordered a different kind of white wine for $12. I wish this restaurant was BYOB. 

For dessert, we got a rainbow cake and tiramisu to share. The rainbow cake was awful - it was so dry and there was hardly any raspberry jam in between the layers. I would not get this again. The tiramisu was good - but I've had better. 

I also got an order of the cream puffs and biscotti to go. The cream puff was delicious. The biscotti was nothing to write home about. 

To review - I'd go back to order the Gnocchi & Meatballs - but this restaurant is too expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Part of me doesn't want to write a good review because I don't want DiAnoia's to get too popular. But man, this place was fantastic from start to finish and I'm nothing if not honest. There were four of us, all of whom are hogs, so we ate the following things:

- Tortellini en brodo.  My friend and I nearly came to blows over who got to drink the broth at the end.  This was a real standout. 
- Gnocchi.  The lightest and fluffiest I've seen in a long time. 
- Amatrician.  My favorite dish, so I've had it everywhere, and this was done extremely well and with a pasta I'd never seen before that was perfect for grabbing the sauce. 
- Wild boar pasta.  Any time B sees this, he orders it, and this, while slightly sweet, did not disappoint. 
- The garlic bread.  The like $3 garlic bread was outstanding, to the point where we got 2. 
- The bread pudding.  YOU GUYS THE BREAD PUDDING.  It comes in a coffee cup and is basically soaked with espresso, which is a very good thing.  

All of the food was truly wonderful, and the service was great.  My only complaint has to do with ambiance/decor.  It's very bright and white, which is probably great during the day but at night felt like it could use some softening.  It's also pretty loud, with not a lot to dampen the noise (concrete floors, lots of windows). That said, this place has been open for about four days, so I'm sure they are adjusting things as time goes on.  

Highly, highly recommend.  I suspect I'll be back within a week."}
{"text":"I booked a large party for my birthday and the staff was very accommodating. They gave us this beautiful wooden table that had a lot of character. The interior design of the restaurant is extremely beautiful. There is a lot of lighting as well. The music was very tasteful although we couldn't hear too much of it in the dining area. Our waiter, Rod, made sure that things kept flowing all night long and did a good job in making everyone feel respected and appreciated. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their dishes. We brought tiramisu cake from outside and they were very accommodating in letting us eat the cake there. It was hard getting a reservation for 7 PM so we had to change to 5 PM but we never felt rushed to leave. Overall, everyone had a fantastic time and will be returning.
Thank you for making my birthday memories so delightful"}

I haven't been to Italy, but from the conversations I've had with people who have been there, this is as authentic as it gets. The wine comes out in a tap, the portions are small, but delicious! The server that we had was someone I've had from E2 and he does not disappoint. We started off with this delicious oil & bread. I ordered the Gnocchi and meatballs, and the sauce was the best sauce that I've ever tasted! We finished with some more dessert (and wine). Highly recommended if you want some authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Top quality food, perfectly prepared, from start to finish. Can't wait to go back for another serving of Tripoline. The stone fruit salad was terrific and the whole Branzino simply delicious. Menu is a bit limited, but there was certainly enough choices for all but the pickiest of eaters."}
{"text":"OMG! It's pricey, but the very best of fresh, seasonal ingredients. Fresh pasta, ask about wine, they have a girl there who knows her wines. They have this cool glass aeration piece that fits on the wine bottle top that brings even more coolness to factor, but it's practical purpose of ridding sulfites makes the wine taste better and banishes the buzz- killing headache. So much to recommend, but the apple/sausage ravioli is to die for."}
{"text":"Great addition to this side of the strip. We started our meal with the tortellini and the bread.   Both were really good however I did not feel the tortellini was worth the cost. Our party tried three different pastas, the boar, the mussels and the ravioli and all three were excellent. 

I'd definitely return here our night was really enjoyable. The only downside was that it was extremely noisy, I guess that's to be expected on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I still stand behind my 5 star review. If you want to be guaranteed a table for brunch or dinner, do yourself a favor and make those reservations ASAP! I've stopped in 4 times since my last review. Once for brunch, once for dinner and twice for lunch!  For brunch I ordered the eggs benny that came with prosciutto and breakfast potatoes and my mom ordered the breakfast pizza. The pizza came topped with kale, ricotta, pancetta, fried egg and the cherry pepper relish. Both of these dishes were delish! I also ordered the maple dirty chai to go with biscotti. There is nothing like homemade biscotti dipped in a latte. 

The two times we came in for lunch we ordered a cheese pizza. Let me start by saying this pizza is probably tied for the best pizza in the burgh. When you can taste the freshness of the tomato sauce and right amount of herbs/Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top you know it's good. The dough is fresh and cooked to perfection. Their pizza stands out from the rest and makes my Italian heart happy! We also got zeppole (fried ricotta Italian doughnut balls) to-go. They make these babies fresh to order and they come out nice and warm tossed in powdered sugar (insert drooling emoji here). 

My girlfriends and I came here for dinner one night after work. They bring out fresh bread and oil to start you off. Since I'm Italian and I LOVE bread, I ordered the gnocchi bread bowl. It is worth every penny. The gnocchi are quite large, but yet soft and light. One thing I absolutely love about DiAnoia's is how fresh everything tastes. From the gnocchi to the sauce to the bread. This bread bowl is extra cheesy too. I highly recommend if you are looking for a staple Italian dish. Now go mangia!"}
{"text":"I recently came here for dinner and feel the need to post and update. I think their dinner is even better than their brunch. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It's a tad pricey but very worth it! 

We ordered the fresh bread with olive oil and it was amazing. Warm and doughy and fresh. It was large and good for sharing - we had a group of 4. 

For dinner I ordered the cacio e peppe which was awesome! Creamy but not too rich. Just amazing. My husband ordered the gnocchi. It was the best gnocchi I've ever tasted. It literally melted in your mouth. We both opted to get them \"sorrentina style\" which is in a bread bowl. Definitely overindulgent and unnecessary but it was amazing. 

Lastly, we shared the zeppoles for dessert. I'd had them before for brunch and they were just as amazing as I remembered. 

Overall a great dinner! I will definitely be returning for a special evening out."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday. The service was fast and it's a large, airy space. I ordered the italiano \"panini\". It was not what I was expecting. It was a cold, deli type hoagie vs a warm, grilled sandwich. It was also pretty tasteless (the \"Squirrel Cage\" has an Italian hoagie that costs around half of the $12 I paid for this \"panini\". And it comes with chips). However, my daughter liked her tomato basil soup and side salad. So, the lesson is don't expect a traditional \"panini\" if you order one."}
{"text":"So unpretentious!  We all LOVED it and the staff was definitely a 5 star. Alex and Sam were so accommodating! We ate, we laughed, we relaxed!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly staff. Thank you for all of the help planning my engagement after party!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. My husband and I went here for lunch yesterday and we loved it so much that we came back again today. We had the spaghetti and meatballs (amazing), pizza with meatballs (huge and delicious), and we tried 3 sandwiches: the caprese, prosciutto and the italiono. All of them were awesome and huge portions. We have a lot left over and couldn't be happier! All of the staff was also very nice and helpful. Overall it was such a great place and I can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food! Charming atmosphere. Feels very Mediterranean in the decor. All the servers were very nice. We came for date night and had the gnocchi - it was delicious! We also had the fresh bread starter which was amazing, almost like a flatbread pizza with just olive oil and Parmesan. I'll come back here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've gone a few times and I've never had a bad meal. Their steak is amazing and their gnocchi bread bowl was the best thing ever. I was there a few days ago and it was tough for me to choose either the steak or the gnocchi bread bowl. I went with the gnocchi and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for my birthday because i kept seeing such yummy dishes popping up and wish i would've went for dinner, maybe it wouldve been better. Lunch is fast casual kinda concept with giving them your name at the counter and they come out and yell your name to deliver your food, its quite the awkward setup and i hope they get a better service structure in the future. Fyi you get free water to pour yourself but they dont tell you until you already pay, nonetheless for a large bottle of water. The food was alright, my favorite was the meatballs. Got a sausage and peppers panini and it was not really good at all. Needed a creamy component to pull it together. My italiano panini was just ok, it was served cold and the only good thing really was the meat, would have liked better buns for the paninis. Wish i would have just ordered pizza. The cashier forgot to ring my latte after we had to call over the barista to ask if he could make it over ice and a big ordeal was made, and it wasnt realized they forgot it until the server said it wasnt on my tab and asked if i wanted her to reorder it. I told her forget it because we already had our food and i wanted to enjoy it before,  but the barista was nice and brought me one on the house which was really nice, some of the staff was nice, but  the server had an attitude, mostly when I simply reminded her that we had more to our order, her response,  \"i only have so many hands!\" So rude. Will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for brunch weeks in advance and still had to wait about 20 minutes before my party of 6 was seated. Rough start.
When we finally were seated, our server popped by to say hello then disappeared for about 10 minutes, By this point, we were starving, and eager to order drinks. We got a carafe of mimosas (about $10 a person) and the portions were a bit on the small side. 
We ordered our food and two of my friends ordered latte/ cappuccinos which did not come out for 15 minutes. The first came out about 25 mins after we were seated, the second about 30 mins after we were seated (meanwhile, they had ordered at the same time?) 
The biscotti my friend had ordered did not come out with her cappuccino, we had to ask our server twice to bring it out for her.
Our food arrived and was FANTASTIC! Delicious all around. 
But it didn't arrive until an hour and a HALF after our reservation. We were now forced to shovel our food down, due to time restrictions we didn't anticipate, since service was so slow.
The restaurant wasn't even that busy, so Im not sure what the issue was.
Getting our checks took ten minutes longer than it should have as well.
The food was great, but there are plenty of good places to eat in Pittsburgh. The bad service makes me hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh! I have had Caco e Pepe in Italy and theirs was comparable. The wait staff was lovely. The only negative is that it's very loud."}
{"text":"I ordered a large salad and an iced tea.  $11.00.  This is average for Pittsburgh pricing.  Unfortunately, the salad was 1 cherry tomato and 2 slices of cucumber over 1 cup of lettuce.  Do not eat here for this type of lunch.  There are far better options (like August Henry's) for a salad downtown.  And heads up if you do have to eat here: their salmon salad 
 is served raw.  I did ask before ordering and saved myself from this.  Another woman in the restaurant did not ask and ate only her 1 cup of lettuce and pushed the raw salmon off to the side."}
{"text":"From the egg sandwiches and homemade sausage to the meatballs and cauliflower casserole you can tell DiAnoia's  is something special. I've never had anything here that wasn't surprisingly delicious. Good stuff all the way around."}
{"text":"it was summer I came in for a lunch ...
the big garage doors were open it was a breezy delightful setting
I had a very delish salad that is all I can remember from that visit
fast forward
I see the video on thrillest for the gnocchi bread bowl 
I like gnocchi 
I like bread 
I like cheese 
so I make a reservation through yelp (yes you can do such things and its great)
we go on a Friday evening 5:15 not to crowded
we are quickly seated 
drink order taken 
with in 15 minutes the place is crazy packed and noisy 
husband gets anxious says this is an Italian place? they don't give bread Ok I can deal 
super sweet friendly waitress takes our order 
Brussels spouts is my starter and I order the gnocchi bowl 
my Brussels arrive nice n hot I few bites and ouch its so salty its tasty but way too salty 
we wait but not too long and my bowl arrives its ok as I begin to enjoy it ok there is an egg shell but hey I have baked and lost a piece of shell but then and I am leery even typing this is a blond hair um ok it happens Im hungry I keep eating then another few bites another hair ok I am done 
I am even leery telling the sweet waitress but she sees that I have eaten very little of my bowl ...
the bowl so tasty but ...
she profusely apologizes, says its not a hair but something from a brush...either way its not her fault

I like this place and I do believe I will return"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best dinner experiences I've ever had in this city! GO NOW! They are constantly packed, so be sure to make a reservation! I talked about this meal to every single person that I encountered for the next few days. One of my coworkers told me I was being \"Di-Annoying\"! Haha.

I've seen some other reviews complaining about how close the tables are and that it's loud. If that is enough to bother you and ruin your meal, maybe this isn't the place for you. I would highly suggest you try to ignore it and be happy the number of tables squeezed in has allowed you a spot to eat here! I'm used to this set-up from eating at a lot of traditional Italian places in Philly, so I was not bothered one bit. 

Great service from the beginning to the end! Our hostess, Esther, was very welcoming and got us seated right away. Our server, Nicki took great care of us the entire time. She was very friendly and extremely attentive throughout our meal! We went with the 3-Quarter Liter of the house wine which was perfect for the three of us to each to have a few small glasses.

Whatever you do, make sure you order the Brussel sprouts. It was one of the most delicious flavors I've tasted in a long time. I still think about them regularly... slightly charred, with a little crunch, covered in a creamy white cheese sauce. It was unreal. So flavorful, I would have sworn there was meat in it, but it was vegetarian! We also shared the Cauliflower, Ricotta, Pesto & Pine Nut dish which was also wonderful as a starter.

I kept it simple with the Cacio e Pepe with crab meat added. It. Was. Incredible. A simple dish that I wanted to keep eating forever. I still think about it a few weeks later. My fianc√© went with the Gnocchi while his father had the Beef Cheek Ravioli. Both were decadent and so delicious! Definitely come hungry and be ready to be in a major food coma after! I'm getting ready to make another reservation to go back!"}
{"text":"This place continues to get even better. Service was great. Coffee was great. And, we enjoyed the new veal pappardelle so much we scooped all the gravy up \"a la scarpetta.\" This may be my new favorite."}
{"text":"Bright, open and inviting caf√©. Very cute! We were here for brunch and it was simply amazing. I had the tumeric  ginger tea....wow. I get herb tea all over pgh and its never like this.  I wasn't super hungry so I went with the ricotta honey yogurt and a couple scrambled eggs. The yogurt was heavenly and eggs; simple and flavorful.  I got to.try a couple of bites of the eggs benedict....I never get this dish normally because i don't think it that good... But after having it here, i now understand.  It was AMAZING!  just yum. 
The coffee was great and the staff very helpful and welcoming. We'll be back. Like next week...."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend eating here, although it is a tad bit pricey. The Polpo antipasto was amazing. For my entree, I had the Creste di Gallo Alla Vodka Bake, which had awesome house made sausage in it. My sister had the Squid Ink Spaghetti Aglio E Olio which was spicier than expected, and not my personal favorite.  For dessert we had a slice of chocolate/lemon \"loaf\" which had a lot of good flavor but was rather dry. Overall it was a very homey and delicious meal.

Update: I went for brunch and the bread pudding was so decadent and flavorful. It was a bit warm in the restaurant and we sat in stools by the door so it wasn't as nice of an atmosphere to not be in the main dining room."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now. I have enjoyed each meal-from the pastas to the veal parm sandwich. The meatballs are very well done with an excellent red sauce. Extremely moist-One of the better meatballs I've ever had without a doubt. 
You can tell that a lot of love goes into their food and the service is always friendly and helpful. The owner really cares and it comes through. 
I am excited to try their pizza next time!"}
{"text":"I finally got to enjoy DiAnoia's after months of hearing great things. I went with friends from work and the staff was wonderful. The food was perfect too. My Friends got the Italian panini & meatball panini. I got the veal parm panini. All of them were spectacular. The bread is exactly what I like and the sauce is even better. I'll be a regular..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Very bright location, tons of sunlight. Haven't done a happy hour here, but plan to soon. Appetizers were spot on and the entrees were top notch. Tough location, so give it a try."}
{"text":"First time dining there tonight. Service was great. You should order the fresh bread with oil... Definitely enough to share.

Our table ordered the lasagna, gnocchi, pasta Primavera and ravioli. They were all good, with the lasagna being the best dish and so on down the line. 

Cocktails are great too. Desserts are all fresh as is everything else."}
{"text":"We really, really wanted to love this restaurant. Local, reasonably priced, and the menu looked awesome. However, it was just ok. My husband and I both ordered a glass of wine and the selections were well-priced and quite good. I enjoyed my burrata appetizer, but it was a little heavy and the bread with which it was served was too thick. My son's brodo with tortellini had good homemade pasta and I enjoyed the sip of broth I sampled. My husband's crudo was nice. The fresh bread served with the meal was also delicious. Our entrees were uneven. My son had the wild boar ragu which he scarfed up quickly. My tagliatelle primavera began with a nice combination of flavors, but after a while it was just too much to eat and the flavors began to feel muddled.  My husbands risotto was horrible -- soupy, bland, and not enjoyable at all. The manager comped us on the risotto, which was kind, but I don't think it should have been served at all -- it was that bad. We are not at all picky eaters, but there was just something a little off about this place. We will, however, return to give it another try.  The service was absolutely flawless and it is clear this is a restaurant that tries hard to please its customers. A little tinkering with some of the menu items and I think it will become a great dining option."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!! I can't say enough great things.... From the service to the food to the drink. Impeccable meal!!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great.  Food is slightly over-priced for the portion sizes in my opinion.  Definitely a good place to go if you are willing to spend a bit more on a special occasion."}
{"text":"The food is good but nothing exceptional as I expected, especially the hand-made pasta was not that impressive. The service is also Okish.  The coffee is great tho! I would go back for lunch or coffee but probably not for dinner, especially that it is a very nice cafe"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Tried things I wasn't sure I would like on recommendation of our server. Started off with an Angel's Envy bourbon, some greens and beans and the Branzino crudo. I loved the crudo and the beans and greens were very tasty. Never had tried crudo before, but this was amazing. Tender and delicious. On to dinner.  My son got the gnocchi and meatballs. I can't imagine this dish being any tastier. My wife had the seafood pasta. Not great. I would go elsewhere on the menu. I went way out of my wheelhouse and tried the spring pea sacchettoni.  Wow. Right up my alley and a flavor experience to be remembered. Ended with a slightly burnt pistachio cannoli and a cappuccino. Great dining experience. Go here..."}
{"text":"No one gets a five star review from me, but this experience was very close. Our server was wonderful- she was familiar with the menu, paced the delivery of courses accordingly and was enthusiastic. Far to often our dining experiences are rushed by the servers hovering, or overly drawn out. 

Am someone that usually needs to supplement my meals with salt, pepper, etc. No supplemental spicing needed here. Everything was delicious and balanced. Menu had something for everyone. 

Make a reservation and enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"DiAnoias never disappoints. A Italian culinary experience that you must try and in the atmosphere of a open market.  The Fresh breads are to die for. Paninnis for everyone and every craving. My favorite is the Turkey and Chicken Parm. Their red sauce is one of the best I've ever had. Along with the meatballs!! Delicious every time. Very fresh burrata!! Creative cocktails and their coffee is so dam good!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious and the staff were friendly. Parking was sparse because it is in the strip district, with lots of other restaurants and places. We came here for brunch, and we had a large party of 10 and they were very accommodating. The restaurant is well-lit with lots of window space. I got hot sausage, egg, and cheese on a bagel with potatoes and some zeppoles. Everything was delicious and everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well!"}
{"text":"Lucky enough to come here for my birthday tonight! I have been meaning to try this place for a seriously long time, even suffering guilt for not doing so sooner since I am italian and love to critique italian cuisine. Putting pizza aside, this has to be my new favorite italian place in Pittsburgh!

The decor was really not like any other italian restaurant I have ever been to. Usually the walls are covered with red or grapevines or something distinctly Italy inspired. The main colors here were blue and white! They had a variety of interesting art on the walls and chandeliers made of wine glasses and bottles. It was perfectly balanced between upscale and casual, pulling off both at the same time, which left me feeling comfortable but also feeling like I was having a fun night out.

We started with a few appetizers. One was a tray of mozzarella stuffed rolls served with marinara, then we had a giant flatbread covered with parmigiana and drizzled with olive oil (it was sooo perfect), and hungarian pickles (random but still really good). I was really impressed with the flavors and how they could have a dish covered in oil while simultaneously not being oily. 

My dinner was a surprise dish and it incredible. It was a play off of the tagliatelle featured on the menu but without the cheese and with cauliflower and tomatoes and something that gave it a crunch (like a crouton). I was really impressed and happy they had fun options for vegetarians. 

Dessert was the real test, though. My grandmother made the most perfect cannolis and I have never had one that compared. She used real ricotta, which very few people use (surprisingly). But I have to say, tonight's cannoli really impressed me. Filled with house made ricotta and little bits of pistachio and orange, it was a real treat and tasted authentic too.

I will definitely come back and love to try their brunch or lunch menu next!"}
{"text":"We went here last week for my boyfriends mom Birthday dinner and it was very delicious. The gnocchi dish was amazing, so I highly recommend that. I ordered The cheese raviolis and they were absolutely delicious... My boyfriend had ordered the pasta with fish and we were all very displeased with it I will definitely return..."}
{"text":"First time and had a terrific experience. The food was very good - three of us ordered three different pastas and shared. Our waiter was the best!  Good sense of humor, great suggestions, attentive without being overbearing. The restaurant was lively, so some may think it's noisy- but I welcome all the action. Nice outdoor seating as well. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had in Pittsburgh! Seriously.

Do yourself a favor and get the Steak Florentine.  It's incredible.  And the Brussels sprouts side were well well well worth it.

The rest of our table had:
1. Gnocchi in a bread bowl (incredible.  I traded bites of steak for this and was so glad I did).
2. Branzino fish (Probably the best fish I've had in the US.  The lemon pepper flavors that came through were a perfect compliment to this buttery, moist fish).
3. Salad and pasta whose names I didn't catch, but were equally divine.

Seriously, the food cannot be beat!

The atmosphere can be a little off putting as the dining area is brightly lit and a bit boisterous, but hey, that's authentic italian!

Pass on the tiramisu.  It wasn't bad, but save your calories for the main courses!"}
{"text":"The gnocchi is fantastic and makes this establishment worth the money.  I haven't tried anything else yet but plan on returning soon to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Four of us ate here tonight. The pictures we've seen don't do it justice. 

Everything we ordered was so delicious. I ordered the Buccata salad and my friend got the seafood salad. We ordered the bread, which is a must! It's not the regular Italian bread you'd expect. Two of us got the ravioli - also not what you'd expect (in a good way) -- while my friend got the spaghetti squash, and my husband got one of the other pasta dishes. For dessert, we had the Nutella pie. Yum...

Our server was very nice but wasn't too knowledgeable about the menu. She didn't know what some ingredients meant but did know which dishes were good. Since this restaurant is new, this is understandable.

We will definitely recommend this place and return!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic for brunch. Service was attentive and patient (we had a toddler with us) and the food was outstanding. The prices were downright cheap relative to the quality of the food. Highly recommend for brunch and look forward to trying it for dinner."}
{"text":"Terrific addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene.  Lots of options. Open for breakfast through dinner."}
{"text":"All the 5 star yelp reviews have a common theme: the gnocchi in the bread bowl. I figured I HAD to try it, and it was basically the best life decision I've ever made! It was literally incredible. They also allow you to BYOB which is always a bonus for me and wine drinking friends. If i was yelping solely on my gnocchi, I would have to rate them 10 stars! However, I had to dock a star for a number of reasons...
I went to DiAnoia's with a party of 9 for a friends birthday. The restaurant was not built to be a restaurant. It's one open space with very low ceilings. There was so many tables crammed in this small space and it was SO LOUD. I couldn't even have a conversation with everyone in my party :(
I also hated our table. Like the actual table. It was a giant high top and the chairs were way higher than the table. I had to crouch down to eat my food. It was very uncomfortable. Also, what is this trend of serving tap water with no ice? WHY? JUST STOP. It was 80¬∞ on Memorial Day weekend, just chill the freakin water or give us some ice?!
In all honestly though, they could serve boiling water and I'd still go back for that gnocchi!! 
The lunch menu looks fantastic, so I'm really looking forward to going back, I just won't go back with a large group!"}
{"text":"It is really too early to review this new addition to the Strip District since today was their soft opening. But, of course, we Elites must get our reviews in early... needless to say, there were some kinks today. I arrived a little after noon and the place was fairly crowded. There was no table service, everyone had to stand in line at the register to order. I was going to get the roasted cauliflower or a panini, but then I heard the wait time was 40 minutes. Whoa. I ordered a small house salad and hot, crusty bread with EVOO and Parmesan. The house salad was pre-made and handed to me immediately. I assumed the bread would not take 40 minutes. I scrounged up a plastic fork and nice quality napkin and sat at the cafe bar to dig into my salad. It was amazing! The ingredients were fresh and healthy, but the salad dressing was to die for. An extremely flavorful Italian vinegarette. Unfortunately, the bread took a long time. I'm not sure how long because I was chilled out with my phone. The great thing was the coffee guy (I forget the fancy name for this) went back to check on my order and a lovely woman came and offered me a bakery treat! The bread came shortly after all this attention and I have to say it was worth the wait. It was hot. It was crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It had a wonderful olive oil and Parmesan drizzle on the top. I can't wait to try more from the menu. Thursday, Nov 3, they will be fully open for dinner. If you don't want to experience the new restaurant growing pains, you'll want to wait a few weeks. I may go back on Thursday to try out an entree."}
{"text":"I hate that I didn't love DiAnoia's because I had been so excited that it opened. I hear \"fresh pasta\" and I start running. 

It took a server about 15 minutes to first visit our table-- they must not have known we were seated. Once we had a server, he was fantastic 5/5!

My friend and I shared the Cacio E Pepe and Primavera (tagliatelle) for our entrees. The Cacio E Pepe was cold and dry and the tagliatelle was bitter and also pretty dry. Both were 2/5. 

We had the bread pudding for dessert which was delicious! The portion was pretty small so we each got one. 

I would come back to try the sandwiches and/or pizza, but not for the pasta.

Parking is available along Penn and the side streets near the restaurant. You might have to do a loop or two around the block, if the strip is crowded!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Pittsburgh!  The ambiance is adorable and the wine on tap is delicious. We had he meat and cheese board and it was fantastic. My boyfriend and I tried the steak and the branzino and we were in heaven with every bite. Our server was extremely nice as well. The only thing I would change, is that they should let large groups know ahead of time that they aren't able to split the check between couples. We were under the impression that we could because it was never said otherwise until the end of the meal which cause a little bit of a debacle, which was resolved with the help of the manager who was wonderful. Other than that, this place is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"PLASTIC IN MY FOOD!!!!! 

Yes, you heard me. I found two chunks of broken plastic (like shattered pieces tupperware) in my main course! This is just the main highlight of our disastrous meal at at Dianoia's. There is more...

1) We sat 10 minutes before another waiter took pity on us and offered to take our order; 
2) We were given dirty bread plates (these were taken away, apologies issues, etc.)
3) We were given day old, stale bread (this was also taken away, apologies issues, etc.) 
3) Oh, PLASTIC FOUND IN MY FOOD 
4) My husband food didn't have plastic in it but it also sucked (how do you mess up gnocchi?) 

The general manager was deep in a conversation with another table for at least 15 minutes before she came over  and offered to cover the cost of our dinner. The owner was clearly present, tasting wines behind the register, and it looked like he was told about the incident, and did not come over to say anything.

This was shockingly one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I REALLY wanted to like this place too. I followed them on Instagram for a few months, adoring their homemade pasta pictures, but sadly, SOMETHING IS CLEARLY WRONG HERE."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed but I'm so glad that my friend picked this place for her birthday dinner! If you're planing on going on a Saturday some things to be aware of. 
1. They do take reservations. A good thing yes. But it seems like once they are booked they are seriously booked. They don't leave any tables open for walk ins. You can walk in and sit at the bar but there's only about 9-10 spots. 
2. They're reservations seem to book up pretty quickly. We called on a Thursday and they were already booked on Saturday. 
3. While sitting at the bar I heard the hostess tell people walking in hoping to get a table that there was a 4 hour wait. I don't know if any food is worth waiting 4 hours for. 

The food is amazing. Fresh and homemade. The bartender was so knowledgeable of everything on the menu. She talked about the food like she was in love with it! It made it very hard to choose but I ended up getting a house salad and the squid pasta. The salad was fresh and light. It's a nice size salad enough for 2 to share. The squid pasta was perfect. I've never had squid pasta before it was just how I would image it to be. I had a few of the potatoes that a friend ordered. They were yummy. Crunchy but soft at the same time. 

I didn't have room for desert but maybe next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks.  Atmosphere is classy.  I love that the \"walls\" open on pleasant weather days.  A cool place.  Also, the mixed drinks and coffees are all awesome."}
{"text":"We popped in one evening out for a walk through USD (Upper Strip District, if you're not into acronyms) and found it booked full! However, the bar had seating and so we ponied up and grabbed a bite. The bartender was delightfully chatty in her red updo and made great suggestions! The meal was quite delicious and we enjoyed our time watching some of the yummy looking meals pass by while we dined. The price was a bit elevated for the quantity however the quantity combined with the quality was satisfying. It is definitely on the repeat list!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for our morning coffees.  We had been past DiAnoias Eatery many times before while walking to the strip but have never stopped.  What made us stop today was the fact that we had the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport.  Whenever my wife and I first walked into the place we were somewhat confused about where to go.  We stood at the bar for a minute or two trying to order before realizing we had to walk up to the register (partially hidden beyond the bar) to place our order.  The inside of this place is quite large with a bar to order once you walk in and some display cases and coolers with a register past that.  They also have a huge dining room that could probably seat 60+ comfortably complete with a giant living edge communal table.  The windows that face out onto Penn are also on garage door track and we have seen them open in nice weather.  For our coffee today my wife went with an Americano while I went with a cappuccino and then we also decided to split some zeppoles as well.  After ordering we headed back to the bar where we had just been standing to wait for our coffees.  Whenever they were ready we grabbed them and proceeded back into the dining room and found a seat.  Our zeppoles were brought out to us a few minutes later still quite warm.  Man they were really good!  The middle of the zeppole felt a little wet even though it was cooked through possibly due to some ricotta giving it an interesting textural component.  Meanwhile the lemon flavoring gave it a little bit of freshness without overwhelming the doughnut.  Lastly my cappuccino here was solid as the milk was frothed nicely and the coffee was smooth.

With all that I had mentioned above, I probably would have given it 4 stars.  However, while we were waiting for our coffees my wife and I noticed that one of their sandwiches, a mortadella & ndjua, was showcased in an industry magazine.  As such, I decided I would stop by later after we had done our shopping in the strip district and get one to go.  So I did just that and took it home to eat.  The menu describes the sandwich as nduja mayo, mortadella, burrata, provolone, fried egg, giardinara and heirloom tomatoes all on a kaiser roll.  It was a massive sandwich and  I was surprised at how thick of a cut of mortadella was on the sandwich as it was maybe an inch thick.  The flavors of the sandwich were really good too and my favorite bites of the bunch were when I got the giardinara and the mortadella combined.  Without that giardinara, the mortadella was a lot.  By the time that I had finished the sandwich I was full and happy that I had gone back to get it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head to DiAnoias Eatery again in the future.  All of the food that I tried there was good and I look forward to trying even more."}
{"text":"The fresh potato gnocchi with meatballs is outstanding!  Additionally, the fresh tripolline with tomatoes, burro, basil, parmigiano reggiano was just as good.  Delicious tiramisu and zeppoles capped off a great meal.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! This Italian \"cafe\" is everything I've ever wanted in this city. It's not impossible to find good Italian food here, but when it comes to basic Italian food, I would say the city falls short. Sometimes all you want is good sauce and al dente pasta without all the frills. Came here on Friday after a failed food experience elsewhere, and after trying to get here for about a month! 

We called ahead to ask if they had any tables and they didn't but said we could sit at the bar. When we got there there were only 2 bar seats and we needed 3. The super nice hostess told us we could sit in the back where there are couches for the bakery area. Worked fine but as we sat down bar seats opened up so we snagged them instead. 

Everyone in the place was really really nice. And the food, was amazing. My gnocchi had a sauce that was so similar to my Nani's I was beyond happy. We also had the Cacio E Pepe and the Linguine (my friend got it without the mussels but would have been amazing with them). 

Only reason I went down a star was because I felt like they had a ton of employees but they weren't always sure what they were supposed to be doing. They weren't standing around chatting or anything, but sitting at the bar we could see the back area and some just looked confused. Also, there were at least 5 tables empty in the dining area at all points when we were there. Which I also found odd. 

Regardless I can't wait to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"So darn good. We were there for dinner with a toddler and the bread was a huge hit, and we felt the service was exceptional. Food was top notch. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the porchetta on focaccia. So very, very good. I'm glad DiAnoia's is here. Thanks, Sam and Heather."}
{"text":"Amazing! Ate there two weeks ago and can't wait to go back. The whipped ricotta with the bread was to die for. Service was great too."}
{"text":"I was not only fortunate to attend a baby shower for my lovely fellow yelper friend, Rachel C., but was granted the opportunity to attend it at DiAnoia's Eatery.  While it was mid-February it was a beautiful spring-like day at the building had a garage door window that was open allowing the warm air to breeze through.  The space is gorgeous, I especially was drawn to the chandeliers, one made from wine glasses and another from beautiful bottles.  

Now, onto the food, because that's what we all really want to know about.  I had a chance to meet the owner and chef and took that opportunity to ask him if he'd consider baking me into one of the meatballs.  I assured him I'd eat my way out.  This request is under consideration, but let me tell you, after one bite you too will start plotting ways to insert yourself into this delicious Italian staple.  My other favorite menu item was the pizza - thin crust with amazing seasoning and the perfect ratio of cheese.  

Dessert was great.  I had what I want to call a powdered doughnut hole, but this is such an underwhelming description of the amazing ball of warm dough with the cream center and garnished in powdered sugar. 

I will now be bringing everyone I know here.  And the next time someone says, \"Do you know of a good Italian eatery?\" and you don't say, \"Yes, DiAnoia's on Penn in the Strip\" I'm coming to your house and kicking you in the shin."}
{"text":"Most amazing Italian food I've had in a long long time. The ingredients tasted so fresh it wasn't funny. Had the ricotta and bread appetizer, and the cheese was so fresh. Gnocchi dish was amazing, but I had to stop to save room for tiramisu. All around amazing food. And the staff was super pleasant! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and gave us suggestions on what to order from whatever parts of the menu appealed to us. Would definitely definitely stop back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it - from the music and decor to the food...homemade pastas and cream puffs filled with real cream! Can't wait to go back to try the pizza and sandwiches! Finally a spot that has it all!!!"}
{"text":"DiAnoia's Eatery is an amazing addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene!! I had heard great things about it and was so excited to come here for the first time in April for my birthday.

The dinner started out poorly for personal reasons - I lost my wallet at the Carnegie Museum beforehand! - so I knew this restaurant was amazing when it turned my frown upside down. We started with the fresh bread with oil and parmigiano reggiano, which was absolutely delectable. The bread tastes like amazing pizza crust made from the freshest ingredients in a little cafe in Italy. We quickly gobbled up every last morsel. For my entree, I ordered the potato gnocchi which was covered in meatballs and a classic red sauce. The gnocchi was perfectly fluffy, and the sauce was light and flavorful, the perfect complement to the hearty meatballs. For dessert, I selected the tiramisu. It was a classic, alcohol-soaked treat. I'm sad to say that I like less alcoholic, Americanized tiramisu a little bit better, but this dessert pays homage to the Italian original. In addition to the amazing food, the service was excellent. Our waiter was very polite and efficient, and our food was prompt.

During our meal in April, I suggested that we bring our guests visiting in June to the restaurant! I am so happy to say that we did. This time, we tried DiAnoia's for Sunday brunch and were not disappointed. Sometimes, a restaurant serves either delicious brunch or dinner, but this restaurant shines for both. We started with trying the stuffed cornetti, Nutella panzerotti, and zeppole. I would have never tried the stuffed cornetti, but my brother-in-law (who's of Italian descent and has family from Pennsylvania) couldn't stop raving about how much he loved Lebanon bologna. All three of the starters were amazing, but I have to say that the zeppole was my favorite of the incredible options. These little Italian doughnuts were perfectly doughy and lemony. For my main dish, I tried the Lemon & Ricotta pancakes and had a few bites of my husband's Steak Florentine meal. For me, the Steak Florentine was a bit too savory and rich and needed a bit of sweetness, but it was the perfect accompaniment to my light and fluffy Lemon & Ricotta pancakes. In addition to the food, I tried the Chocolate Chai. Even though it was 90 degrees outside, the beverage hit the spot.

In summary:
DiAnoia's = Amazing
DiAnoia's is an incredible Italian restaurant that feels straight out of Italy.
DiAnoia's offers both flavorful brunch and dinner and many must-try dishes.

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food was amazing and the service was just as great! We got the appetizer special for the evening which was fresh ricotta they just got in from Philly, topped with a lemon glaze and hazelnuts, served with toasted bread. For and entree I got the Tripoline which was fantastic. And dessert we sampled a bit of everything! They also gave us complimentary after dinner drinks. Shoutout to Sam for making wonderful recommendations for us! I really appreciate an establishment that delivers not only excellent food, but service as well. This is a must for those who haven't had the chance to try out this place yet. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been eyeing the gnocchi bowl video from Thrillist for a few months now and had to try... We went for dinner and ordered the Arancini to start, and the Gnocchi, Sorrentina style, as well as the Asparagi Taglialoni. The Arancini were delicious, much creamier interior than expecting. The Gnocchi bowl was certainly worth the hype...we enjoyed it so much that we did not even touch the Taglialoni at the restaurant (although, when eaten leftover, was incredibly creamy and delish)! The gnocchi were little pillows of delight, and we enjoyed dipping pieces of the breadbowl in the creamy sauce mixed with the pecorino. Well done, DiAnoia's...we will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"Brunch here was spectacular. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. There were lots of tasty options, both savory and sweet. Definitely try the Italian donuts...they were warm and delicious! If you want something sweet, try the lemon ricotta pancakes and if you want something savory, try the eggs in purgatory. Top it all off with a fancy cocktail and you're looking at one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I recently went to DiAnoia's after admiring the aesthetic via the internets for weeks since it had opened. I had no friends that cared to eat with me, so I stopped in during my weekly Saturday trip to the Strip District. The internet did not fail on the aesthetics...this place is adorable, light and magical feeling when you walk in. I sat at the bar and resisted with all of my strength to get a cocktail. Instead I ordered an almond latte and a prusciutto sandwich with fresh mozzarella, roasted tomato and arugula with balsamic. The sandwich is a pretty standard, simple one but...wow...the execution was superb. The ingredients were high quality and the bread is something that i could wax poetic over all day. The roll was so chewy and fresh and everything I could dream it to be. I am really excited to go back sometime and eat a bowl of pasta. If they can make a simple sandwich make me fall in love...I can only imagine what the pasta will do!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Easily one of the best steaks in the city. Everything was delicious. We even took some cookies home with us. Excellent service, relaxed vibe, interesting space and beautiful food. Great work."}
{"text":"We went here after hearing good things and it lived up to the hype. The ambience was bright, clean and an open space. There were windows that opened onto Penn Ave. and it was a nice, airy feel. There were larger tables that looked good for bigger groups. 

We ordered three entrees for two of us because we love to taste everything. We had gnocchi and meatballs. Gnocchi and meatballs both were really big, both had a nice consistency. The gnocchi was light but not so light that it lacked density in the center. The meatballs were flavorful and soft. I thought they could have had more flavor but when I ate them the following day as leftovers I loved them more. I think it was a matter of eating several competing flavors at dinner and my palate was overwhelmed. That's my bad. 

Cacio a pepe- my favorite. I think. Pasta with cheese, cracked pepper and I think there was cream. It was like eating Italian mac n cheese and it was so incredibly good. I ate the most of this dish. My husband avoids creamy food but even he was gobbling on this one. 

Finally, we had rabbit tagliatelle. At first, we took it for granted. The other two were so flavorful that this dish fell flat. Almost. Then, after a few bites I really started to appreciate the understated flavors working together in this dish. It wasn't too rich, it was unpredictable and so good in the most humble way. It didn't need to show off with pretty red sauce or weighty cream. 

Couldn't fit in dessert but the limoncello was smooth and strong, which is not easy to pull off. I loved the restaurant and can't wait to go back. Didn't find it to be expensive and it was nice enjoying the Strip District at night time again. Also, can't forget, very friendly, knowledgeable service. Maybe it was Nikki? Not sure but she was awesome. She made sure we enjoyed our experience and it was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Nice bright casual ambiance.  Young friendly waitstaff, not at all stuffy.  Still, you know it's a special place.  
There were several dishes we tried that were easily 10/10.  Try the branzino crudo.  Absolutely delicious.  The texture of the gnocchi was sublime.  The bread appetizer with a glass of red wine is amazing.
But, there were a couple of misses.  The pasta that came with the clams was under seasoned.  The marinara that came with the gnocchi lacked any kind of umami.  It tasted like Pomi crushed tomatoes went straight to the plate.  And the cauliflower ricotta casserole had so much garlic it was difficult to stomach.
I'll be back, knowing what I know, because I can put together a list of grand slam hits.  But, sadly, it is not yet a place where every dish is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Everything for dinner is just wonderful. I had the spaghetti al limone - tender, sweet shrimp in a light cream sauce. At first the pasta seemed a little underdone but then the cream sauce just soaked in and it became perfect. My husband had the Octopus pasta, which is VERY strongly flavored with the Uni sauce, but was also delicious. The whipped ricotta appetizer was creamy and perfect and probably would be a perfect dessert even - it was so rich!
The only minor, MINOR complaint I had was that the tiramisu is extremely strong on the espresso flavor and was lacking in creaminess; it was a little grainy. But I still enjoyed it and the Amaro selection that our server helped us with was perfection. I wouldn't have known how to pick an after-dinner Amaro without his help, but I LOVED the one I got, and my husband loved his as well.
We'll be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Came here after someone recommended this place to me. Their homemade wine is pretty great. We ordered the crudo, squid ink spaghetti, and the cacio e pepe. I especially enjoyed the Crudo! I definitely want to go back to try more things on the menu. Overall, a very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited DiAnoia's during lunch to take advantage of their deli menu, and I can't wait to go back to try their dinner service, which is a fuller menu and sit-down. There was a quite a line already when we arrived, but it moved quickly and there were plenty of tables to choose from once we placed our order. 

My lunch date and I shared the large order of meatballs and I had a taste of the panzanella salad, both of which were superb. So flavorful with such fresh ingredients! The space, during the day, is filled with light and a pleasant buzz (not too loud inside, which is nice for lunch conversation!)

The desserts in the glass counter were calling to me seductively as I waited in line to order and pay, but I managed to pass this time. I'm already counting down the days til I can come back for dinner and splurge on a sweet treat for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food was everything you wanted it to be. It's the kind of Italian food that made you fall in love with Italian cuisine in the first place. I went with two friends and we split the meat and cheese board. On the menu it says it's for two but honestly it's probably more for four. For our entrees we had the tagliatelle, the ravioli, and the gnocchi. They were all fabulous. I personally had the gnocchi, they were like little fluffy clouds of perfection. The red sauce that accompanied them was so fresh and flavorful. The only thing I didn't love about our experience was the lighting in the restaurant. It's a huge space so I understand the challenges of lighting it properly but we were there at 8:45pm and it was so bright in there I though it was noon. And that was enough for me. It to do the full 5 stars because it really took me out of the atmosphere of having a great late night dinner on the weekends."}
{"text":"Gnocchi in a bread bowl.... AMAZING. Melts in your mouth. Pretty large portion and a had enough to take for lunch the next day. Service was great."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to try DiAnoia's I finally got my chance. Upon arriving I was instantly impressed with how cute the place was. People sitting at the little bar ordering drinks or coffee. Cute little dining area. 

After much debating I ended up going with the Cacio e Pepe. It sounded simple but delicious. Plus all the photos on yelp had me drooling before I could even order it. While it was certainly simple it was most definitely delicious.The flavors were amazing and it tasted so fresh. My only regret was not ordering a side of meatballs or a salad.

After that experience I'm definitely even more excited to try their brunch and the rest of their menu. The pizza and gnocchi is at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute! Came here Saturday morning with the intention of getting some sandwiches, but after seeing the pizza our minds were quickly changed. My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza, half cheese and half sausage. The server at the counter was super friendly and answered all of our questions. They have lots of outside tables, which we happily enjoyed on the one nice sunny day so far this year in Pgh. The pizza was AMAZING. Almost everyone who walked by stopped to ask about it or make a comment about how good it was. We will definitely be back for their pizza!!"}
{"text":"Caught this place on Instagram and knew I had to stop in. It was exactly what I was hoping for, solid Italian panino choices but I went for the veal parm. After I ordered I noticed they had a nice selection of beer and craft sodas can't go wrong here. Great addition to the area and a welcomed addition to my list."}
{"text":"I think I said, \"Oh my God, this is soooo good\" at least 10 times as I shoved my face into my meatball panini.  However 10 times does not even describe how good it was... 

Hubs and I stopped by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the History Center.  I was starving and heard this place was legit.  One look at the menu and I knew a meatball panini was coming my way.  Hubs ordered the veal parm panini which would have been my second choice.  Oh the happiness to come!

I was SHOCKED at the size of the meatballs... They were the size of tennis balls!  This fresh crusty bread with San Marzano tomato sauce, and cheese to top it off made me salivate.  I couldn't dig in fast enough.  I couldn't fit the sandwich in my mouth, so I dug in with a knife and fork.  I am not ashamed!  The light and flavorful meatballs were so good they would make an Italian grandma jealous!  The fresh bread that crunched with every bite gave the perfect amount of texture.  I wish I took a photo of the cheese pull!  

After scarfing this delicious sandwich, I definitely need to schedule a reservation for dinner.  I've seen photos of the gnocchi bowls... 

To be continued ..."}
{"text":"Delicious meal with so many options that I want to go back and try!  I had the linguini and mussels and it was very tasty and satisfying. The atmosphere feels like you might have stepped in a true Italian bistro.  It's a very relaxing atmosphere and the staff are very attentive.  If I had to give a slight downside I would say the food is a la carte (dinners don't come with salad or bread) but honestly the quality is there.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Growing up in an Italian family I am always cautious when trying pasta out.  I went to DiAnoia's after a fellow goomba recommended the place to me.  I did not leave disappointed.  

I ordered the \"cacio e pepe\" which was described as an \"Italian Mac and Cheese.\"  It was delicious.  The dinner all around was a great experience.

So much so, that a week later I went back for brunch and again did not leave disappointed.

I don't really have much else to say other than, you need to go there and try it.  I'm not a foodie who sits and critiques the way I'm waited on, the presentation, all that crap (which by the way, both were great when I was there).  I just enjoy good food.  And DiAnoia's has all of it."}
{"text":"DiAnoia's is a great addition to the Strip District, it sits away a bit from the commotion of the strip which is actually good because you can find street parking nearby. I haven't stopped in for dinner yet but I have stopped in for brunch multiple times and it's superb. Everything is very flavorful and the space itself is bright and cozy. In the summertime they open up the windows so it's becomes very nice and airy. I love it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's not like the other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Very authentic and the service was outstanding. I went with two other people and we ordered a variety of food to share. We started off with the cheese and meat plate for our appetizer, it was very good. There was about 4 different types of meat and 4 different cheeses. Then we got the gnocchi, ravioli, and a side of meatballs for our dinner. It was all very tasty, the ravioli was my favorite. I finished off my dinner with homemade limoncello which was also amazing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious!

Came here for a friends birthday.  We generally like to load up on carbs for these occasions and this night was no different.  We started with the bread which was pizza dough with delicious olive oil and Parmesan sprinkled.   I love olive oil so I had to ask for more!

We decided to split three pasta dishes so we go the vodka bake, gnocchi and cacio e Pepe.  The cacio was perfectly al dente and the sauce was creamy and decedent.  The gnocchi were the best I have had, they were legit pillows, super light and heavenly.  The gnocchi came with meatballs which were hearty and delish and the red sauce was everything!  The vodka bake was very good as well, but was outshined by the other two pasta dishes. 

Service was great.  We got there early and had a drink at the bar, wine list was good and the bartender was fantastic! 

Overall super enjoyable meal, authentic, and simple great flavors!"}
{"text":"Definitely, a good place to have your breakfast or brunch. Their soups are amazing. Meatballs are HUGE and are about as good as meatballs can be. Pasta made fresh every day."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had. The gnocchi sorrentina style (in a bread bowl) was to die for. Will go back JUST for this dish! Though everything everyone at our table ordered was great (steak florentine and porchetta as well.) Ambiance was great - didn't find the volume to be overpoweringly loud - I thought it was average for an extremely busy eatery. Service was good."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Phenomenal food! Unique brunch selections. The specialty drinks are unique and delicious. Total surprise and they were super accommodating for our large group of 10. We will be back every time we are back in the Burgh! Living in Austin which has a foodie reputation I can say this is better than anything we have had in Austin."}
{"text":"I was super excited for an Italian restaurant with a pasticceria--one of my big gripes with PGH is the lack of Italian pastries. We headed here on a Friday night, foolishly without a reservation, and were able to snag a seat at a high top table near the entrance (our 7pm arrival would have netted us a 9pm seating in the main dining room). We ordered an assortment of dishes:

-Tortellini en brodo. We got this purely because of Yelp recommendations, and the broth was indeed delicious and deeply flavored. The tortellini themselves were a bit chewy, not in an \"al dente\" way, but in a \"this pasta is too thick\" way.

-Pork neck toast. The pork was nicely tender, but the red sauce accompanying it was overly sweet.

-Cauliflower with ricotta and pine nuts. This was a very large portion, but was a bit lackluster. The lightness of ricotta wasn't highlighted with the seasoning, and with only ricotta, the dish wasn't cheesy enough to be a gratin.

-Ravioli al'uovo. We're a bit biased since we make this at home (with sage brown butter), but we though the richness of the egg yolk was lost amid the creamy sauce. While the assorted mushrooms lent depth to the dish, one of the varieties remained significantly firmer than others and didn't meld with the dish.

-Cinnamon roll. This was topped with a really tasty, pleasantly sour frosting. Full marks on that part! The roll itself was fine, but wasn't served warm, so it was a little firm and definitely needed the heaping topping of frosting for moisture. But the real downside to me was the stunning lack of Italian pastries--while there are some Italian *desserts*, the pastries are pretty much all French! No pasticiotti, no sfogliatelle, and not even any cannoli! (As an aside, it is a travesty that most of the places in the Strip fill their cannoli with whipped cream...an even bigger affront than not having any.)

-Limoncello. This was a delicious housemade version with just the right amount of lemon...no medicinal quality whatsoever.

They currently have no happy hour specials, although our server hinted that might be in the works. I'll give it another shot for the sandwiches, as service was excellent and the place has great ambiance, but I repeat my plea for actual Italian pastries in PGH!"}
{"text":"Can I give more than 5 Stars? Like 500? DiAnoia's is that good! 

I've been there for brunch a few times and it's been great. Tonight, I had the best Italian food of my life, made by someone outside of my big Italian family. The gnocchi bread bowl was heaven! It brought me memories of my grandmother. Melt in my mouth delicious! 

Besides the outstanding food, everyone who works there was pleasant, courteous, and helpful. My dinner was fantastic in every way and I look forward to bringing more friends and family with me next time."}
{"text":"Second visit.....not so good.   The first courses were all lovely.  The pasta courses were bland and disappointing.    Mine was essentially pumpkin Mac N Cheese but the consistency was horrible.   Fellow diners had ravioli and a lemon and shrimp pasta which was also boring and had little flavor.   The cocktails were good though."}
{"text":"We recently had New Year's Eve dinner at DiAnoia's Eatery. 
 It was fabulous!!!!  It was a fixed menu, but the options were outstanding.  The steak florentine was out of this world.  Also, the greens and beans were delicious - different than a lot of other Italian places, they were more beans than greens.  The porchetta was to die for!!!!!  The crudo was simple with just olive oil, lemon and branzino - so darn good!!!!! 
We did opt for the premium wine pairings and they perfectly complemented our meals.  
I can not wait to return when I can choose from the entire menu.  DiAnola's is a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene."}
{"text":"I had read and heard such good things about this place so I was very excited to try it.  I REALLY wanted to try there most talked about dish-the gnocchi in the bread bowl.  My boys surprised me and took me there for lunch on Mother's Day.  They had made reservations so we didn't have to wait.  The restaurant was very busy.  It took a few minutes for our server to come to our table.  He took our drink order and told us the specials.  When I looked at the menu I was sad to see that it was the brunch menu and the gnocchi that I had wanted to try was not on the menu.  I almost asked if it could be made but I didn't want my sons to know that I was disappointed since they were treating me to lunch.  I ended up ordering the breakfast pizza.  The crust was nice.  The toppings  were good.  The egg on top made it all very tasty.  It still seemed as thought it was missing something.  Maybe a brightness?  The pizza was pretty big.  I ate a couple of pieces, one of my boys at a couple of pieces and I left the rest.  Once we had our food our server only came back to give us our check.  Someone did come and give us a fresh bottle of water for the table. The food was good but not great.  The service was a bit lacking.  I was bummed.  I will, however, go back . . . .just to try the gnocchi. I'm hoping for a much different experience on the second try.  I'll post an update."}
{"text":"Stopped by DiAnoia's a few nights ago to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated near the window and were greeted by a friendly waitress. We immediately ordered drinks, the house red blend for me and the amaro new fashioned for him. Both were great choices! 

Next up was the appetizers: we decided on the heirloom tomato tart, fresh bread and a side of olives. Try the heirloom tart, it is outstanding!! 

For our main course I got the cacio e pepe and he went for the gnocchi. Both were quite tasty, but the cacio e pepe was a little too watery for my liking. 

We were so full from dinner but just HAD to get a piece of tiramisu to go. I have pretty high expectations for tiramisu, and unfortunately this one fell flat. It had an odd lemony taste to it which completely threw off the flavor profile. 

All in all, I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  My date and I shared the Heirloom Tomato Tart.  Sounded different and it was!  Then had a side of Meatballs that were excellent.  She ordered the Gnocchi which was huge.  Also came with 2 giant meatballs.  I ordered the Cacio E Pepe and it was fantastic.  I can't recommend enough to try this place.  The prices are good for the food you get so we were very pleased and will definitely be back again to try."}
{"text":"DiAnoia's was so good that I had to go back for lunch the next day. I split a pizza and two sandwiches with some friends. We sat at the bar.

First let me start with the sandwiches. Made on home made bread, who does that??? What a great idea. The veal parm with prosciutto was really good. The veal cutlet breading was like a home made cutlet, not what you typically get on a sandwich. Very good. The prosciutto sounds odd on a parm hero but gives the hero a nice saltiness.

We also had the pork with broccoli rabe and hot peppers. If you have ever made the trip to the famous Dinics Pork in Philly, this sandwich is just like that. Really, really good.

Now for the pizza. I am from NY and I have been to all the famous pizza places you hear about. Now Im the type that hasn't really come across a pizza I didn't like, but the pizza at DiAnoia's was good. Like really good. I could not believe that this NY style pizza came from an oven in Pittsburgh. The crust was super crispy, well done, with charring all around-just the way it should be!

Also, the service was great. It was well paced and we were not rushed at all. We had great real conversations with both very friendly bartenders. They both impressed us with some very nice mixed drinks. My favorite was the iced espresso Based drink I think it was called the Merda."}
{"text":"We were seated outside and waited 20 mins and got no service. Not even some water while we wait. So we left. I do like the environment and that is why I gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Having eaten all over Pittsburgh, I'm thrilled with this relative newbie and find it to be among the best Italian options in our city. It's got a little of everything - besides being a full service restaurant,it also serves breakfast, has a small bar and offers elements of a deli and bottle shot (added bonus is that restaurant guests can visit the coolers and pick out their own beer from a nice selection).The decor is fun, comfortable and anything but stuffy. My only complaint is that it's way too bright.They need to change up the lighting and use the dimmer switch when it's time for the dinner crowd to arrive. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable,but each visit has had its hiccups, once including the server getting orders for four of the five guests, but forgetting mine. Fortunately, the food completely rocks, pushing my overall rating to five stars, overlooking the flaws in service and atmosphere. The crudo appetizer is spectacular. The pasta entrees are delectable. While they tend to be a bit on the rich and heavy side, they're nonetheless perfectly cooked and with top notch ingredients that work well together. The linguine with mussels and garlic is an awesome new spin on the old school linguine with clam sauce. The Tagliatelle with charred radicchio, caramelized shallots, Gorgonzola,fennel, spinach, toasted walnuts and pesto is one of the richer vegetarian pasta dishes that you're likely to try. The restaurant has a bread appetizer on the menu, but if you don't order it,they'll bring you some delicious bread with dipping oil (I can only imagine how good the menu item is, but an up-charge bread menu item in an Italian restaurant just doesn't \"fit.\"). Save room for dessert. They make them in-house and they're darn good. The Ricotta tart is a great option if you prefer a dessert on the more savory side. There's a decent wine list,including lots of by-the-glass options as well. Now if they could just dim the lights and iron some wrinkles to make the service as flawless as it is friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop! Had the turkey pannini.  A friend got the meatball sub. It looked fantastic. 

They also have a bakery and bar. 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things and read so many good reviews about DiAnoia's so needless to say I was super excited to give it a try. The gnocchi bread bowl is crowd favorite here and very well known so of course I had to try it. It did not disappoint!! Omg the homemade gnocchi is out of this world. It melted in your mouth! The bread bowl was also amazing. I couldn't eat much of it cause wow holy carbs but I really enjoyed what I did eat. I also had a meatball on the side which I typically don't order out because I prefer my moms homemade ones but just like the gnocchi it was amazing. It's also byob which they didn't want to tell me when I called and asked. They first explained that they have a full bar and wine list then said the cork fee is $12 which in my opinion isn't terrible.I can't wait to go back and try the brunch. The pizza and sandwiches look so good. 

Just a few more things about my overall experience here. The restaurant itself is cute and casual. I love the blue and white color scheme. Making a reservation was a bit difficult as when I called the restaurant was extremely loud so the person on the phone could not hear me. They kept repeating back the wrong date to me 3 times then finally getting it right. I was nervous it was wrong so was sure to call back and confirm. It's a nice size restaurant but not terribly big, lots of tables very close together. I came with a party of 9 for my birthday. They sat us at the one large high top they have. It was very uncomfortable because the chairs were too high for the table. We all had to crouch down to eat our food! Seriously please get new chairs for the table. As I already said it's extremely loud so it was hard to hear our server and hear each other talk. I do not recommend coming with a large group. It was a hot day and they had the garage doors open in the front which was fine but it was so hot, there was no AC on at all. They serve room temperature water but we all needed an ice water. I was eager to hear the specials but at 8pm on a Friday night they were already out which seemed odd to me. 

All in all, I loved the food and will be back but they do have a few minor things to fix. I really really expected a great overall experience and I didn't get that but like I said the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"DiAnoia's offers unbelievable fine dining Italian food in a casual atmosphere. Simple menus let you course out your meal on one side and explore cocktails and drinks on the other. The wine list is excellent, the space is beautiful, and the service is attentive and enthusiastic.

All of the pastas are made fresh in-house. My recommendation? Order an appetizer or two and a salad for the table; pair it with a pasta. Or, get a few sides and order one of the entrees. Don't overthink it--if it looks like you'll like it, you will. If it looks like you might not like it, order it anyway and invite me to dinner. Leave room for dessert...I certainly didn't, but I guess we all need something to bring us back again.

Since it's in the Strip, parking is pretty easy within a few blocks, but the space fills up, so you're best chance is to make a reservation or hope there's an opening at the bar. Or get it to go!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great food - although a little too much garlic in the meatballs and everything is covered in cheese - although still good!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Deli food in Pittsburgh, this is the place. Everything is made with fresh ingredients, the staff are friendly. You are just not going to find a better deli sandwich in the Burg. I highly recommend the Italiono for a taste of what sandwiches used t"}
{"text":"I love classic European style restaurants and service. The food is great, the restaurant is clean, the bartender we had that day was a little condescending. He wasn't interesting in speaking with his customers and I guess that's fine, but he was a little rude and ignored a few questions we had. We also noticed when a woman came up to order coffee he replied with \"do you mean Americano\". Eh, not cool just get the lady a coffee (tomat-O tomat-A am I right?). The food is fantastic and I love to follow them on Instagram. I think this place will develop and grow and I expect to see good things down the road. We have only done brunch there, but we want to make date night out of it for Dinner."}
{"text":"I give out very few 5 star reviews but this place definitely deserved it!!! I don't even know where to start... our waitress Jules was amazing - kept our drinks full all night AND a smile on our faces!!! We started off with the Apple Salad which was SO fresh and the dressing was like nothing I've ever tasted before!! Next we had the Crudo and the Caputo Brothers Whipped Ricotta and the Hot Peppers & Oil - they were all SO delicious I couldn't even tell you which was my favorite! We could've stopped there and it would've still been the most amazing meal we have ever had, but our entrees were next! I got the Gnocchi (served with the biggest meatballs I've ever seen!) and my sister got the Pumpkin Carbonara Rigatoni, which is a seasonal item on the menu. They were both PERFECT and we were so glad we had saved room to eat our entrees after all the food we had leading up to them! Make sure you try their draft wine too - I could've stayed there drinking it all night!! The owner Chef Dave was SO good to us, checking on us multiple times throughout the night which is almost unheard of in the restaurant industry any more!! We will definitely be returning to check out their famous brunch and lunch options in the very near future and suggest you do too!"}
{"text":"there is SO much to be said starting with the super cute Italian vibes from the outside. Unfortunately we didn't have the privilege of sitting in the dining room, but had a cute little intimate setting at the high tops by the window. The food came out so quickly and was DELISH. Split the gnocchi in the bread bowl, more than enough food! All the wait staff was so friendly and engaging. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner here with coworkers. We had a large group (12) and one waitress. She did a wonderful job at serving all of us and we weren't her only table for the evening. The seating is decent. It's not intimate yet not distracting. The main attraction here is a nationally famous dish of Penne in a bread bowl (which is good if you're a carb fan) but that's not the best thing they have to offer. I would recommend eating fresh made noodles that won't fill and bloat you, Brussel sprouts, and a cold beer to wash it all down. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! We went for Valentine's Day and loved our food. Only thing was that our waiter was uneducated on the preset menu. Nonetheless the food delivered!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian!  Nicole is a gem :)"}
{"text":"After months of salivating over the foodie community's Instagrams I finally made it to Pittsburgh Italian restaurant DiAnoia's Eatery. Located in the culinary hub of the Strip District, I was pleasantly surprised at how charming this spot is! I walked and immediately gushed over the chandeliers that are made of  WINE BOTTLES and WINE GLASSES!? I immediately felt at home.
It's a beautiful space feeling open, clean and fresh with white walls, highlighted with unique kitschy d√©cor.
I meet my two girlfriends on a Tuesday for a 6pm reservation. After a long day at the office we were ready for wine & carbs! DiAnoias does have a lovely light white moscato (from the dessert menu hahaha). I was thrilled.
We had a very sweet & charming waiter who was subjected to our gushing girl talk. He was great and added to our amazing experience.
For my meal I ordered Cacio E Pepe of spaghetti, grana padano, pecorino romano, black pepper. With handmade pasta and delicious cheese it was a very fulfilling, deliciously rish dish.
My friend ordered the mussels with bucatini, fennel, red pepper flake, parmigiano reggiano, white wine, garlic and butter.
My camera-shy girlfriend ordered potato gnocchi, with meatballs, red sauce, and pecorino romano.
For dessert I treated myself to more indulgence with a Nutella brownie and hazelnut gelato from local Shadyside Millie's Homemade Ice Cream. My brownie was certainly a treat, with warm gooey nutella and fudgey bits.
I'm really glad we got to experience this charming Pittsburgh Italian restaurant. I can't wait for an opportunity to return to  DiAnoia's Eatery for dinner again,  and hopefully for Sunday brunch as well! I shared more on my blog at http://moscatoismymantra.com/pittsburgh-italian-dianoias-eatery/"}
{"text":"I ordered an old world pizza here with onions to go. It was around 2:30PM and when I called they told me it would be about 20-25 minutes. I got there a few minutes early to pay, and grab some drinks to take along with my pizza. While the staff was super friendly, there seemed to be a bit of a communication issue amongst them. I was waiting at the bar for forever for my pizza, and finally when one of them asked me what I was waiting for and if I was waiting on a GrubHub order I said no and that I had been in here this whole time and had already paid for my pizza. The girl said my pizza was ready the whole time and I was just standing there waiting an extra 15 minutes. There were 3 people there working the front and there was almost NO ONE in here when I went since it was after lunchtime, but doesn't seem like anyone was paying attention. So once I finally got home and had my pizza, it was good but there are also a bunch of other places I could go where I am not waiting for forever. Don't know if I would go back or not."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING! My brother recommended it to me when I asked where my friend and I should go for a glass of wine and dinner, and it was honestly the best place he could have recommended. The atmosphere was great, the staff was super friendly (even when I had to be a pain and ask for a different table), and I loved that there was multiple seating areas- inside, outside, and at the bar. It was a Tuesday evening and they were really busy, but that wasn't really a turnoff. Our waitress recommended wine for us, which was great. After seeing A LOT of people around us with the gnocchi and meatballs we figured it must be good and decided to order and split it- great choice, it was delicious and it was a decent sized serving and I was full after splitting it in half."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal and the service is top notch! The bartender made me a nightcap and whipped cream by hand to top it off. Overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Wow!!   We really enjoyed this \"Italian Gem\"!!! The food was authentic and very tasty.  The menu selections were fresh and seasonal.   My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every selection and the cookies were amazing!   Our server was pleasant and very accommodating!   If you love Italian food you certainly won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch and it was super packed! We had to wait a while for our food and coffee. From seating to paying the bill, total time was about 2 hours. Everything was worth the wait. The food was good. I recommend the doughnuts! They're served warm and pair perfectly with an espresso."}
{"text":"The beauty of the atmosphere is surprisingly refreshing coming in from the highly industrialized area in the Strip District.  It is a diamond in the rough with cuisine resembling what I imagine to be old world Italy or even France.  Since I have never been to either Italy or France I cannot say that for sure, but the combination of atmosphere and cuisine makes this the perfect spot to visit.  I recommend visiting after a trip to the Heinz History Center or a stroll in the strip!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised because I've been here a few times and I couldn't see any of my past reviews. Have I totally lost my mind and not written one? Am I getting so old that I think that I do stuff but I really don't? All things that I ask myself when thinking about my delicious meal here.

I will say that I went for brunch and I made a reservation beforehand. They're usually super busy on a Sunday for brunch so if you are looking to just pop in it might not work out the best for you. But try, maybe you can get a table. But the good thing about Yelp is now you can make a reservation right from your Yelp app for this restaurant which worked really well for me for that Sunday brunch.

So we got seated right away, which I would assume would happen since we did have reservations, but our food took a while to get to us because the kitchen was very backed up. The wait staff did tell us about this but only 20 minutes into the 50-minute wait. The food was really good when it came out at least mine was but it was a long time to wait for brunch.

I ordered the iced latte with a shot of vanilla and it was phenomenal. Just the perfect amount of vanilla and the coffee was brewed to perfection. I hate how some places have iced coffee that's so bitter but they try to mask with the taste of sugar. This coffee had none of that aftertaste of weirdness. 

I also ordered the Nutella stuffed pastry and it was very good. My only complaint is with myself because I did not read the menu correctly and I thought that they were going to be little Nutella stuffed donuts and not the Nutella stuffed calzone that it was. But this was my bad. I wanted something that was more finger food and this had to be cut with a knife and a lot of Nutella spilled out. So while delicious it could have been a little bit better if it was little donuts dipped in Nutella like my mind had it. But that's my fault again for not reading the menu. But if they have an idea of what they want to add little donuts that you can dip in Nutella would be a great addition to the menu. 

And then for this time I ordered the eggs in the sauce. I actually cannot remember what it's called so I need to look it up so one second. Okay was called eggs in purgatory. So on the menu it said that the eggs would be poached in sauce and served with a side of bread. The problem was is that I don't know if the sauce was too hot or if it's sat in there for too long but the eggs were not poached eggs they were basically hard-boiled by the time that I got them. Not what I was expecting, but still good. The dish was also way too hot to eat for a while and that added to the time that it took for us to eat breakfast. So while good not really what I was expecting or what I wanted. The bread that came with it was super fresh and the sauce that the eggs were hard-boiled in was really really good too. But I was expecting poached eggs and those were not poached eggs. And maybe they started out poached but because of the heat of the sauce at just cook them way too much. That's something for me to ask next time I go in.

Like I said it's been a few times that I've visited here and I've always enjoyed myself. I will say that Sundays are quite loud and busy. But the food is worth it. Just know to read the menu and to ask questions about what you're getting. I don't think that you'll be disappointed. Because even though my meal wasn't exactly what I wanted this time, it was still delicious and I ate all of it."}
{"text":"Had heard great things and it definitely didn't disappoint! Everything was really good an the drinks were awesome to"}
{"text":"Ok, I am torn...had the 'Table from Hell\" again. SWMBO said not to say anything.  Then we tried to make sure I sat in a seat that gave more room and a chair we thought that no one would cut thru behind.  Welllllll, I was only bumped into about 5 times by the staff and did anyone apologize??????  
Noooooo!!!!!  
Was the restaurant full.  No! 
Could this table have been not seated?  Yes!!!!!!   
The food is good.  But!  Service tends to be scattered.  Our waitress was nice and answered a few questions.  We ordered drinks and someone from the bar delivered but it took over 10 minutes.  Our appetizers was delivered by someone and they were good.  Then when our meal arrived, the plates were dropped in front of us and our empty appetizer plates not taken and now a very overcrowded table.  Also, no new forks for our meals, which is OK sometimes but not with the different type of meals we ordered.   The pasta I had was very good and cooked perfectly.   This  could be a good restaurant, if they got the service figured out and maybe remove one table.
And yes it is noisy."}
{"text":"Loud. Too loud. Needs more sound insulation. Few pasta selections for an Italian restaurant. Hurried waiter. Failed to tell us they were out of the ravioli until I tried to order it, so even fewer still pasta selections. My beer took about 15 minutes to show. Overpriced wine list. We had the least expensive bottle of red on the list. A table wine called Maiana Salice Salentino. It cost about $38 or $39. You see it online for about $13, retail. I get that most restaurants make their money off liquor sales, but a 300% markup is gouging in my book. The house salad was tasty and big enough for us to split. The meatballs were big and good with a tangy red sauce. The olive plate had a nice variety and a fair quantity. The gnocchi had a nice texture, light not doughy, and the porchetta plate fun, different, and plentiful.  The zeppoles for dessert were delish. I'd prefer, though, if they let the customer choose how much powdered sugar to apply versus coating them in it. I'd return, just not in a hurry to--it's not a relaxing place to eat, and hope in the meantime they'll moderate the wine $ markup across the board. Even the wine on tap isn't inexpensive."}
{"text":"The Roasted Cauliflower and Meatballs were a PERFECT Tuesday afternoon lunch option. We are the small portions and still left feeling full without being stuffed to the brim.  If you like Cappuccino's get the Pistachio, it's amazing. And the chocolate chai was perfection in a cup."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for dinner with my wife who has been raving about it for months, And she finally got a reservation.
I have to say I am not a big fan at all of DiAnoia's Eatery and I am a bit disappointed as most of the reviews are really Really good??????.
We had a reservation and we where seated immediately which was an excellent start.
I first have to say that the selection has something to be desired as there is not a very good overall selection too choose from.
I also felt that the tables where way too close and jammed on top of each other basically.
I also have too complain about the noise level it was extremely loud and unpleasant too be there.
I thought I was in a bar or a Fridays.
The waitress finally came over and took drink orders after a while wait.
I looked at menu and for me I was not happy as my favorite dish and more or less my goto dish is chicken parm which they did not have.
I ordered a house salad and raviolis in red sauce.
Then I am talking too my wife and asking where is the bread and butter or olive oil is???????
I have never been too any restaurant in my life that did not start you off with bread and butter or olive oil??????????.
The raviolis where just ok nothing special at all and would not get them again.
Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the house salad which was really good.
The waitress was not very attentive maybe she had too many tables too work???
One other issue which arouse was that my wife found two hairs in her meal about 3-4 inches long, she showed the waitress and she said it was from a brush??? but did not illiterate.
They did take it off the bill but still not happy.
I thought the service was very slow, There was way too much noise and the food was just not that good and the selection was not good as well.
Unfortunately I can not recommend DiAnoia's Eatery at all and I will not be going there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the place but the biggest single problem was that our young waiter gave us the impression he wanted to turn over the table quickly.  After the four of us were seated, we ordered a bottle of wine and several appetizers and bread and said we wanted to wait a bit before ordering,  After that point, the waiter was by the table maybe 4 times in 15 minutes again and again asking for our dinner order.  I noticed that other servers did not seem to behave in this fashion so maybe it was just the inexperience or impatience of our waiter.  The food was very good, and the house wine selections were just great and very fairly priced.  I would like to try the place again but with another server."}
{"text":"Going to reiterate my 4 star rating.

Food is actually very good and compares reasonably well to food you might get in Italy. But compares well does not mean it is as good as what I've had in Bologna, Naples, Sicily, or Tuscany.

The pizza, particularly with rocket and proscuitto, it very good as are the soups and salads. The place is clean, bright, and the service is friendly-- I would eat here more often if I lived closer.

But, while a wonderful place to lunch or have a very good dinner, it is not a special place where one would celebrate an event or special occasion. On further thought,  I don't think DiAnoia's tries to be one of those places, which is okay."}
{"text":"Went with 2 other couples for a birthday celebration. Had such a fun and tasty meal. Seriously recommend family-style with your group because you are going to want to taste everything!!! Its all so good. We shared the greens and beans and Crudo (salted fish) for appetizers, rabbit tagliatelle, the tagliatelle bolognese, and Tripoline for the pasta course (they were all so good and home made noodles but the Tripoline was my favorite) and the whole roasted Branzino (a light white fish) and meatballs for the second course. Everything was great! We had a selection of home made Italian cookies for dessert. Also we tried a liter of the red wine (like a pinot noir) on tap, which was new to us, and we found it to be quite good. Loved the atmosphere and the service was fantastic!! All the servers and waitstaff were so pleasant and helpful. Fun night!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! We had to wait a bit for a server but they definitely made up for it with the tasty cookies in our to go bag. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Sitting down to write a restaurant review can be tricky at the start of the new year...with the nonstop holiday eating and drinking behind us, it's not always easy to find something that truly stands out.  UNTIL...you try the breakfast sandwich and doughnuts from DiAnoia's Eatery.  When I tell you it's the BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had, I'm not exaggerating.  I sat at the bar/counter area on a Saturday morning and was feeling a little indecisive on just how to construct my breakfast, so I left it up to my server...and he nailed it.  A slab of spicy sausage topped with a runny egg and cheese...all sandwiched between a soft, fresh brioche bun. It was perfection.  I tend to lean more towards bacon when I order breakfast, but the spices in the sausage, combined with a perfectly cooked egg (not overdone and rubbery like so many other places) could not have been better.  Balance that out with the sweetness of the Zeppole (italian doughnuts) and you are on your way to having a very very good day.  DiAnoia's is a very welcome addition to the Strip District neighborhood...but just far enough away from the craziness that it maintains the neighborhood cafe feel.  I can't wait to try out lunch and dinner as well.  Welcome to the neighborhood DiAnoia's!"}
{"text":"I've been saying I wanted to visit DiAnoia's Eatery for quite some time.  A couple of weeks ago on a Tuesday evening we were trying to decide what was for dinner - close to Lawrenceville and new to all of us.  DiAnoias it was!

The 3 of us were excited to try all the fantastic things we had heard about.  We got a couple apps to share.  The whipped ricotta was amazing - they only gave us a few pieces of bread, and with how much of that amazing ricotta there is - even if you put a TON on the bread - you still need more.  Our waiter graciously gave us a bit more when we got it packaged up to go.  Everyone also enjoyed the olives.

Our entrees were phenomenal.  We have already spoken of going back - as soon as possible - we just have to get our schedules to coordinate.  We can't wait to head back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I had the Panazella Salad I loved it so Delicious!   I also had there meatballs they were really good I loved there sauce !  It's a nice atmosphere when it's nice out they can open up the big garage style window so it's opened to the street.  They have a few outdoor tables,  you should make a reservation, I went there on a weekday thinking I could get right in, but they were full.  They serve Wine and Beer!  Everything seems so fresh!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a super cute but quality brunch place, come to DiAnoia's! A new and vibrant eatery along Penn Ave. They have a nice bar area as well as a decent sized seating area. Their brunch menu had plenty of options that I was eager to try. I ended up ordering a mocha and the prosciutto eggs benedict. My friend ordered the french toast. 

The mocha was smooth and well-made. The eggs benedict was delicious. Every layer was perfect from the crunchy english muffin, salty prosciutto, and creamy spinach to the poached egg with hollandaise sauce.The hollandaise sauce was creamy but not too thick just the perfect consistency. My only complaint was the egg should have been a bit more runnier. The side of potatoes also were great, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

My friend's french toast was made using panettone bread so she said it was unique but could have used a little more fruit or toppings. Overall, a nice addition to the Strip District. I would love to come back to try lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the food was really really good and the lay out is so cute! I love the big windows and spacious set up. I had the eggs Benedict with prosciutto- and it was delicious! It came with crispy potatoes on the side that were seasoned just right. My boyfriend got the breakfast pizza- which was also great! Here is my issues: The woman who served us and also working the register was so incredibly rude to me. I was sitting at the bar and she was so off putting that I wished I had waited for a table. I have dealt with rudeness many times before (who hasn't!) but this was so unprofessional and ruined my time. I hope whatever was bothering her that day got better, you never know what someone else could be going through! I wish I could have been treated with the same consideration. -1 Star for the lack of hospitality, -1 Star because it was so dang hot in there!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here. I had pasta with mussels. Pasta was house made and mussels were very fresh. My daughter had crudo for an appetizer and she and my husband thought it was the best dish of the night. Service was good. My only knock is that it seemed too bright inside."}
{"text":"Great service, trendy atmosphere, the food was really good. They also have a small parking lot for customers which was a perk. We got the gnocchi and the polenta, bread, tiramisu. The gnocchis were large but fluffy and delicious! Coming from an Italian family I'm a huge critic so not quite 5 stars but really good overall, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner and it's been great both times. My parents rave over the tuna sandwich and stop by for lunch often. I try to stop by when I'm home from Pittsburgh. Last night we went for dinner and loved everything! We had gnocchi, the squash dish and two spaghetti dishes. Their tiramisu is great, had it last night. This is definitely more of a casual dining spot. Very cute inside. Lastly, they have great drinks. My brother had a chilled espresso, limoncello after dinner that was really tasty. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pastas aren't as flavorful as you hope they will be, everything is a bit too salty. The gnocchi, I've had them both styles, is incredible but again the sauce is always so salty. The lobster and crab pasta I got was lacking flavor. The portions are huge, leaving you plenty for dinner and leftovers the next day. The cocktails are so yummy and strong. The wine list is impressive. I'll be back for more gnocchi, hold the salt."}
{"text":"I've been to DiAnoia's a couple times now. There is a cute area at the front where you can sit and order a bottle of wine -- I will definitely be back for that! 

However, both of my food experiences have been just ok. The first time I ordered the pasta with sausage, raisins, and pine nuts in a chicken stock. It was just ok -- a little bland.

The second time I went for lunch and ordered the house salad and a cup of minestrone soup. The house salad was decent and the soup was pretty good, but there was a broken piece of plastic in the soup. My friends shared a pizza and I have to say, it looked really good! I might be willing to forget about the incident with the plastic and give the pizza a try sometime."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last Saturday night. (Get a reservation!). All the pastas were cooked perfectly. The house red wine was fair priced and very good! The best part was that it wasn't hipster pretentious. So many restaurants in Pittsburgh now have to put an ironic twist on whatever cuisine they are doing. Not so here - it was a modern, fresh take on Italian in a simple setting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. Had out of town family visiting and decided to go for dinner based on the reviews. 

Made reservations and were seated right away.  The server brought water which was warmer than lukewarm.  We had to ask for ice.  The wine selection by glass was minimal and entirely overpriced.  Much more extensive bottle menu (highly overpriced as well).  As a result, we stuck with water and iced tea.

Could not believe bread was not included with meal--in an Italian restaurant--but you could order it for an additional $8!!!  Ripoff!!  Paid $18 for an order of gnocchi and meatballs, and nothing else included.  Salad was an additional $8 or $9 dollars.  The gnocchi were very good but meatballs too heavy and dense.

Prices entirely too high for what is offered.  Not a good value at all.  Was embarrassed to have brought my family here.

Service was good, however.  I really wanted to like this restaurant, but will not be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an excellent experience here. The atmosphere was very upbeat. It was a little loud, so we were glad to be seated near the open air area. However, the noise was laughter and talking amongst friends and family at other tables, so it wasn't unpleasant. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wine selection and the other items on the menu. We didn't feel rushed to decide what we wanted, which was appreciated. We ordered two glasses of wine, the fresh bread, meatballs, and we each had the tripoline. We didn't have a single complaint. The pasta was al dente, which is often not the case at restaurants. All in all, it was wonderful, and we plan to go back again."}
{"text":"Parents came to town, they are picky when it comes to dining out. Everyone's food was awesome! I had the house salad and porchetta panini, and the meatballs were the best I've ever tasted! The mocha was also great. Great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on my niece's recommendation and I was not disappointed!   I reviewed all of the menus because they have one for lunch,  brunch, and dinner.   And being a vegetarian I would have to say I would have a very difficult time for dinner but the lunch was excellent and the brunch menu looks wonderful  too. 
 My friend and I split the caprese Panini and the eggplant Panini and the roasted cauliflower everything was excellent including the very special drinks that the bartender mixed for us!"}
{"text":"We have eaten dinner here numerous times since nice it opened and have found the food fabulous as well as the service. We were there for brunch today. The French toast and the ricotta and lemon pancakes are yummy."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the strip! We visited DiAnoia's for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. We walked in to a little bit of a line where you wait to order before sitting down. The layout of the restaurant is sorta cool. Theres a full bar when you first walk in. Comfortable enough to have coffee (they serve counter culture for all the coffee snobs out there) or a cocktail/beer. Behind the bar is an open kitchen that sits beyond the bakery side of the restaurant. 

The dining room is an open concept that seems more of a lunch diner/market than night time restaurant. There was a lot if natural light with no curtains over any of the windows. The corner of the dining room has two garage doors that will surly come in handy on a nice day. The dining room was large and can easily accommodate small to large parties. There was one really large high top table which was made of a beautifully crafted single piece of wood. Large enough to fit 12 to 14 people comfortably. 

Now for the food. We ordered the Veal Parmesan, sausage and peppers, turkey avocado and the Italian sub all of which were served on freshly homemade bread which we were told was made daily in house. Honestly the bread was the best part of the sandwich. For those who appreciate really good homemade bread this place is for you! Lastly we ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Each sandwich was more delicious than the next. My favorite was probably the sausage and peppers. Probably because it wasn't what I expected. The sausage was ground up smaller pieces rather than large links. The Italian had a delicious hot pepper relish on it (not too spicy) that took the sandwich to the next level. 

Our food was delivered to our table within 10-15 mins of sitting down. The wait staff still seems to be working the kinks out because some of our food came out wrong. However they were super accommodating in making it right. Our pizza came our without toppings and the chef made us a whole new one (to go) the way we ordered it at no charge. So we were given two for the price of one. You just don't see service like this anymore. As if they hadn't done enough already, they gave us a box of baked goods to go as well. What a way to leave a lasting impression. They too were delicious: boscotti's, cookies, cakes etc. DiAnoia's went above and beyond to make things right when, in my opinion the food was worth the wait. I look forward to visiting for dinner!!"}
{"text":"The gnocchi here were great.  Some of the best I've had and I'm a gnocchi aficionado. I liked the bread too."}
{"text":"Service was warm and friendly.  The food was great.    My friend and I went for brunch.  We had the Zeppole to start.  They came out warm, and tasted light and sweet.  Delicious.  We split the breakfast pizza, and it had great flavors.  The crust is perfect, light and chewy.  It was a beautiful pizza.  And it wouldn't be  brunch without a side of tasty perfectly cooked pancetta.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about my review, because the food was great.  However, the service was not - and it really did affect my experience.  

I'd wanted to visit for months, and finally had the chance to go to celebrate my birthday this weekend.  When we arrived, we waited about five minutes to be greeted.  It's a busy Saturday night, that seems reasonable enough.  To wait another ten minutes for our server (or anyone for that matter) to stop at our table isn't.  When he arrived, he told us to place our entire order then, to make it easier for the kitchen.  Okay...we weren't in any hurry, but we did have plenty of time to decide, so we ordered.  Our drinks came well after our first course, and the wine I ordered to go with my meal came when I was nearly done.  

As far as dessert, I was on the fence - the server said \"it's your birthday, have something - it's on me.\"  I ordered one  *incredibly delicious* cookie and a latte.  He brought it and another small treat with a candle in it.  Nice touch, but a little disappointing to see the charge on the bill, given the offer.  

Overall, the food was wonderful but the service was lacking enough to have put a damper on our celebration."}
{"text":"I finally got my opportunity to experience this Italian restaurant. I arrived a little early before they were serving lunch but they were happy to accommodate me. They do serve a limited breakfast selection but they have a very tempting group of inviting pastries all made in house.

Free WiFi is available and they are part of the coffee passport if some of your favorite coffee places are listed on it. They have beautiful artwork and some merchandise for sale including pasta and tea.

I was given the lunch menu and told to order at the counter. Once I completed that then take a seat anywhere in the main restaurant. Since it was a beautiful day they had the front windows open to give you that dining outside feeling.

I wanted the eggplant Parmesan panini. I was told it was huge so I deferred ordering anything else. I was told it would take about 10 minutes to prepare and my name would be called. Not long after the man who took my order brought it out to me and asked me to pay when I leave. I thanked him and was glad this was the only thing I ordered. This sandwich was indeed very big and quite filing! It seemed a little lukewarm  in a spot or two but it was cooked through and through and I really enjoyed it.

As a matter of fact this panini alone was just under $10.00! Not bad for a sandwich this size. DiAnoia's is also featured on grubhub so that you can order in advance for either delivery or takeout.

This is a very popular restaurant and gets crowded quickly. Reservations can only be made for dinner but for me getting there right before it opened for lunch was perfect. No long waits, great food, and good prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome staff! Can't wait to go back and try something new! I had the sausage and apple ravioli and my friends had the gnocchi- both filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Another great food find in the Strip! Authentic Italian food, this isn't one of those places that claim to be Italian, it's classic Italian! So good, I got the prosciutto panini it was so good! I also took a bite of the pignoli cookie (pine nut), it was also so good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out for lunch today with co-workers and all the paninis got a thumbs up. Employees definitely need to be friendlier, as I got attitude from two different people among picking up my order. Didn't catch the dude's name who was running the register today, but he probably would have been more excited watching paint dry than ringing me out. Other than that, I'd love to try their pizza sometime...looks fresh and awesome."}
{"text":"Made a reservation (a must here even on weeknight). We arrived five minutes early, but were still seated 15 minutes after our reservation. Normally Its the party ahead of you taking their time but the reason became very clear that it was the service. While our server was nice and informative, they appeared to be a little short handed because we were not able to put our appetizer order in for another 20 minutes (about to eat the napkins at this point). All in all for a two course meal, it took us two hours. Great for a weekend but not ideal for a unsuspecting weeknight. So be sure you are not in a hurry when you come here! Now onto the food:

The olive oil bread: resembles a giant pita because it is hollow inside. Tasty because its bread but if you are between appetizers, go with something more unique. 

Arancini Appetizer: three very tasty fried risotto balls. Very cheesy and very delicious. 

Braised duck pasta with mint: very light and very mild. Great for someone who wants pasta but doesnt want something very heavy. 

Braised veal entree: My favorite. For about the same price as the pastas, you get a lot more meat. The polenta is awesome. 

Gnocchi with meatballs: gnocchi perfectly cooked. The meatballs make it extremely filling so it's definitely a lot of food without the bread bowl. 

Lamb pasta: my favorite of the pastas. Red sauce but meaty and all the flavors combine well. 

So the food was superb to say the least. 

We ordered a liter of the draft wine and it was not good. Nor was it that much cheaper to just get a bottle of something you know that you would like. Skip the draft wine."}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh restaurant community has continued to flourish in the decade or so I've been eating around here, and DiAnoia's is another solid addition to the food scene, adding a \"must have\" location to the outskirts of the Strip District.

Before I get to the food, I have to give a nod to the atmosphere at DiAnoia's.  Unlike some of the dull and drab food venues, the eating space is bright and inviting.  The blue wordmark is a great compliment to the high-reaching white walls, and the large lounge chairs and displays give it a very comforting feel inside.  Whether you're in the dining room or sitting right at the coffee bar, the space feels open, even when there isn't an empty seat in the house.

Now to the good stuff:  the food.  In my multiple visits to DiAnoia's, I've had the breakfast sandwich (which is crazy good), the panetonne french toast, the breakfast pizza, the lemon and ricotta pancakes, and the veal parmesan.  Every meal has been delicious, striking that fine line between satisfied and filled-to-capacity, something I run into at many other establishments.

Maybe that's why I always have just enough room for dessert!  My last visit, the waitress (also from the Poconos, represent) suggested a homemade cookie plate, all which were made in house.  Add a glass of whole milk and it was the perfect punctuation on a busy brunch service.  Even though they were getting packed up early on a Sunday, the service was incredibly courteous and attentive.  Also, do yourself a favor and order the zeppoles!  You will NOT be disappointed.

Good food is worth waiting for, so if you're the impatient type, do yourself a favor and make a reservation.  I got stuck waiting all of 3 minutes without a reservation before, but as it continues to grow in popularity (rightfully so), you can avoid any inconvenience by making one.  All in all, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, a quick drink, or anything in between, DiAnoia's is a great spot to experience one of the new and best restaurants Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"Best place we ate during our long weekend in Pittsburgh. Would recommend this place to anyone. Great food, great service. Atmosphere eclectic. Hide the bread basket, that stuff is addicting. The bar needs more staff. They are busy serving bar eaters, we waiting customers are kind of a second thought. Not a criticism more an observation. My husband gave up after the first wait. Went back up a second time and got served."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food, every bit of it is elegant. Meat balls and gnocchi, the best I have ever had. Chilean bass- exquisite. From the bread to the salads to the tiramisu, wonderful. Just the best restaurant ever."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch the other weekend. Our reservations were at noon and we were seated promptly. We ordered the eggs Benedict and the breakfast pizza. Both were delicious. The eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was flavored just right. The breakfast pizza was huge and equally delicious. Would definitely order both items again. Then, we had coffee, we tried the mocha and cappuccino. I personally liked the mocha more. Can't wait to come back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally got the chance to last night. We made a reservation a few days before, which I think was the right move. The place was packed when we got there, and stayed busy the whole time. The atmosphere is great! The restaurant itself is huge, and the dining room is lively yet feels homey.

We started off with an order of fresh baked bread, which was warm and delicious. For my entree, I had the spaghetti al limone, which was shrimp and caviar in a lemon cream sauce.The lemon  sauce had a great flavor without being overpowering, and there was tons of shrimp and caviar too. I do wish there was something in there such as herbs or a vegetable that brightened it up a bit, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I also got to sample some of the gnocchi and meatballs which were delicious (and I would probably order this next time instead).  

My only complaint was that service was pretty slow the entire night. It took us a while to get our entrees and our bill. Understandably it was very busy, but I think they could have done a little better on that part. Still, our waitress was friendly and great at explaining the menu. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Extremely Disappointed.

After seeing this establishment on Facebook (featuring their famous gnocchi bread bowls), my friends and I immediately made a reservation for 7:30 pm on a Friday night. When we arrived, we were welcomed by a gracious hostess and seated almost immediately. To our surprise, the restaurant was pretty empty and after we sat down, our waitress informed us that they were out of gnocchi already. AT 7:30 PM! This was incredibly surprising given that they start dinner at 5:00 PM. We only came for the gnocchi bread bowls so we debated leaving. But the waitress told us that we couldn't go wrong with any of the other meals, so we stayed and ordered something different. This was a lie.

We started out with the Meat and Cheese platter, which was very good and came in a large portion (given the $32 price tag). We then ordered our meals. We got the lemon ravioli, the duck tagliatelle, crispy polenta, and the cacio de pepe. All the meals were average at best. My friend couldn't even finish the lemon ravioli because she was eating a literal lemon. It was so sour I thought they wanted to recreate the sensation of a lemon head. After barely finishing our meals, we waited for a very long time for our server to take our plates away and hand us our checks. We saw her chatting with the other kitchen workers behind the cash register and had to chase down another waiter to get our checks. Our waitress finally came back and delivered our checks to us while admitting that she 'forgot' about our table. 

Overall, this place is not what it is hyped up to be. I don't understand the high reviews this place gets since their service is disappointing and their food even more so."}
{"text":"I really wanted to wait until I had dinner here, but guys, I have NO DOUBT anything they do is perfection! Why, you ask?

Because I've been multiple times and it's always spectacular! I'm super into their meatballs and nothing tastes as good as hearty meatballs in a fresh baked roll aka the meatball sub that I basically lived on during my pregnancy... Add melted quattro formaggio and it's ON!

I also had my baby shower here and they did an excellent job hosting. Everything I asked for was there and plentiful. The price was right too!

It has a casual atmosphere so you really feel comfortable popping open a bottle of vino or enjoying one of their many cocktails while dining on delicious Italian food. They also offer up a full espresso bar with deliciously crafted drinks that definitely have an Italian influence. My fave is the calabrian mocha, which is a mocha with a kick of spice.

Their brunch is bomb. You must get the zeppoli's. Their pizza might just be some of the best in the Burgh. I'm not a pizza crazy person, I think a lot of pizza's taste the same, but theirs far exceeds expectations. They'll be opening a dedicated pizza window soon, so stay posted on their social for that! 

And DO NOT forget to grab a cookie or dessert before you leave! They have a dedicated pastry chef and their sweets are incredible. I had a cookie table at my shower and sampled each and every one of them!"}
{"text":"First visit and we had a really nice brunch.  Nice light airy atmosphere.  Beautiful days so the roller-doors were open all the way.  A bit loud but that's the solid walls with no sound absorption. Good service from friendly staff.  Bloody Mary and Negroni were well made.  Eggs Benedict and Veal Parmigiana really good. Pricing is very fair.  Looking forward to trying dinner.  Will be back soon for that."}
{"text":"This is some of the most authentic and delicious Italian food in Pittsburgh! Don't expect a dainty or light meal, but nearly everything we've tried here has been stellar. The gnocchi, the cauliflower gratin appetizer, the light crispy bread appetizer...yum. It is also the kind of place that's nice for a date night or a group, but in no way stuffy or pretentious. Just be sure to get a reservation, because the word is out about how good this place truly is!"}
{"text":"Definitely try this place out. It's a bit pricey but the atmosphere is unique and the food is great. I got the famous gnocchi sorrentinna, and it did not disappoint. It's very large and could easily be split with someone else. It was unlike any gnocchi I've ever had. Downside is that I had killer heartburn for the rest of the night, but that's just me so don't let that stop you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow. That's a hell of a meatball sandwich. Nice place, very open, friendly staff at a serve yourself counter. Got my food out quick. You could smell the greatness coming from the kitchen. The cheese was first rate. The meatballs themselves were solid but the cheese made the dish. Fresh spices. Get lunch here."}
{"text":"This is the sort of place where you can't go wrong on the menu. Everything is delicious. I know this because I ordered way, WAY too much food,* and I'm not sad about any of it, not even the stomachache I have from trying to finish it all.

As a quality Italian eatery, I was not surprised to find that their meatballs are about as good as meatballs can be, and that the Italiano panino is top quality as well (that cherry pepper relish makes it pop). 

If you arrive before 11 am on a weekday, the breakfast sandwich (add coppa if you know what's good for you) is an excellent choice, and pretty much the only one. The pizza is also good; sausages and hot peppers are a winner of a combo.

But I want to talk about the Ham & Cheese. 

This is not your average sandwich. This is their fantastic house bread slathered with boursin cheese and stuffed to bursting with honey smoked ham that was tossed in a pan with a messy and generous amount of black garlic barbecue sauce and topped with pickled onions. It is holy fucking shit delicious, and I'm still dreaming about it. And it's only $10. 

As an added bonus, DiAnoia's is bright, clean, staffed by the friendliest folks you'd ever want to have putting gigantic portions of Italian food in front of you, and it has what looks like the finest selection of amaro in Pittsburgh (sweet Montenegro tap handle). 

Love this place. Love.

{"text":"Solid Italian food. I'd call it a mix between old and new approaches. The flavor is solid and their paninis are massive--not like a \"traditional\" Italian panini. That's pretty much how all their food is."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Thursday evening. Bright, clean restaurant with friendly wait staff. Very unique dishes that were flavorful, and the portions were very generous. The tiramisu is a must have."}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple? days ago to give this place a whirl after passing by. The interior is spacious and cute, but horribly bright - personally, I'm not a fan of that kind of ambiance. Either way, moving on. I can't recall our servers name, but he was a gem and wildly helpful. If you aren't familiar with Italian cuisine I suggest you pull out Google or ask a zillion questions - like we did.

 We ordered the Burrata Crostini for our appetizer and absolutely loved it. Our dinners were the Winter Risotto and Cacio E Pepe (see what I mean about needing a translator?). The pasta was good, but for the price ($16) it wasn't worth it. It's was a small dish of pasta, no meat, so the price was a bit steep. The risotto was creamy and delicious, definitely worth the cost. 

I really want to like this place, but to be honest i didn't like the confusion of the menu or even the bathroom. I understand wanting to be authentic, but if I can't read the menu or differentiate between which bathroom is which I'm not enjoying myself. (Note, I promise I'm not a complete idiot)."}
{"text":"One of the worst dinners we've experienced in Pittsburgh. Just another faux gourmet eatery with tacky trendy d√©cor and AWFUL food. The atmosphere was very unenjoyable and our server barely spoke English. He treated us like we were idiots that have never dined out before. 

My main course was the Rye Rigotti--looked as disgusting as it tasted. It appeared to be a bowl of slop that tasted like dirty dishwater. 

Truly a horrible experience. 

I definitely do not recommend. Nothing like the photos or reputation. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Recommended? Oh, 99.97979% YES! 

Cuisine? Italian. Chef Dave Anoia was chef de cuisine at Spoon but he decided to open this eatery close to us when he heard I moved to this area of Pittsburgh.. :) 

What to get? We ordered: 
1- Contorni (vegetables and salads): Cauliflower, Ricotta, Pine Nuts & Pesto. 4.19990 stars. 
2- Antipasti (appetizers): Crudo: which is Branzino, Sicilian Sea Salt and EVO. 4.999999 stars. This is a MUST!!! It's like Italian sashimi. Ask the waitress for some lemon slices to squeeze few drops on top.. It was absolutamente FANTASTICO!! 
3- Primi: House-made Ricotta & Egg Yolk Ravioli, Mushroom Duxelle, Truffle Sauce which was 3.195995 stars. Ravioli were huge 2 pieces but more on the bland side. They're filled with one egg; cooked to give liquid yolk. Chef Dave, sorry but they can be better :). If they were filled with seasoned meat and onions at some point, would that be a better option!?  My friend ordered house-made Gnocchi & Meatballs With Red Sauce,  I can't rate it as I didn't try it. 
4- Complimentary house-made fresh bread with good ol' parmigiano on top. I hate to say it, but it was PERFECT! 5.00000 stars!!! 

Atmosphere? According to our nice waitress, the owner's wife designed the unique amazing chandeliers herself; using old wine bottles and wine glasses, so cool!. Atmosphere is causal, cozy and I loved their table napkins. 

Next time, would order the CRUDO only and eat it with their amazing bread.."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner for our first visit. Beautiful space, very bright and open, one bad thing was that this place was sooooo loud for some reason . The waitress had to ask us to repeat things 2x for everything we answered. Ordered the starter of bread with olive oil and cheese and I have to say that was amazing. I could have just ordered another and been more than happy with just that. Ordered gnocchi and grandmas spaghetti. They were out of gnocchi so had to order plain spaghetti and meatballs since my gf only saw the gnocchi as what she was in the mood for. The sauce and meatballs were pretty solid , especially if u like meatballs that are more on the sausage flavor side. My other dish was a bit different with a lot of zucchini and chunk tomatoes and some other veggies. The sauce turned into a weird orange hue and the zucchini and squash were really overcooked , too much for my liking. Nice place but I certainly won't be running back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I'm so glad I found it because it's so hard to find sauce and meatballs near the level of my mother's in a restaurant.  In fact, I've become SO offended by Italian restaurants over the past ten years that I've even sworn off ordering red sauce and/or meatballs in any restaurant, until DiAnoia's. 

I went once for dinner in November for my birthday, and was thrilled!  We had the fresh bread with olive oil and parmigiano reggiano, and trust me, it was totally worth the cost.  When we first saw the price on the menu, we were like, \"this bread better have gold baked into it,\" but then it arrived and it was enormous.  But not only that, it was spectacular.  I had the gnocchi and meatballs for my entree.  The gnocchi were like pillows, and the meatballs were tender and flavorful.  

Today I was there for lunch, and the format is completely different.  Grab a menu, stand in line, order, pick a table.  I don't absolutely hate that, but it's not my favorite way to dine out.  Aside from that, I was completely thrilled again.  We both had spaghetti and meatballs, and I cannot find anything wrong with anything I ate.  The sauce isn't sweet, but it's not tart or spicy either.  San marzano tomatoes definitely make a giant difference, I don't care who tells you what.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  The meatballs were once again tender and flavorful.  And most importantly, both bowls were brought out piping hot.  WITH cheese already on top for you.  Absolutely fab.  

My only cons for the place are:

It's a little loud.  Maybe hang a tapestry or something.  (This would not go with the hipster vibe at all, I'm well aware.)

The hipster vibe.  I am not a hipster millennial.  I don't relate to everything having to be just a little quirky or \"elevated.\"  I just want the good food.  I feel like they could deliver the good food without having the air of trendy arrogance floating around. 

I don't like that the lunch and dinner menus do not coincide.  Why can't I have pizza or spaghetti and meatballs for dinner?  Why can't I have gnocchi for lunch?   I get that they don't want to do breakfast all day, but in an off-the-boat authentic Italian place, I should be able to get the classics during all business hours.

And then that different format thing.  Casual for lunch?  Fine.  But make it casual for dinner, too, then.  Sit-down for dinner?  Nice.  But make it sit-down for lunch, then, too.  I don't want to have to relearn how a restaurant operates every time I go there.  

Yes, the food is good enough to completely overlook the cons, but I like it when businesses -- of all kinds, not just restaurants -- make it easy to do business with them.  The fifth star for me is always detail related, and those nit-picky details are enough for me to take it away.  Definitely NOT food related at all.  The food is impeccable.  I just want all of it all the time, and I don't want to stand in line to order it, and I don't want to feel like an outsider while I'm eating."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly even though we had not made reservations. The entire staff was courteous, attentive and genuine in their enthusiasm for this excellent restaurant.  We enjoyed the meatballs fresh bread and three delicious entrees a little bit salty at times for my taste but all seasoned and prepared in fine fashion. There are some really good wines to choose from as well.  We plan to return soon and I recommend that anyone looking for some authentic Italian dining give this place a try. Definitely make reservations because they are quite busy for all the right reasons."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch and I'm happy we did. We both got paninis, sausage and peppers and also veal parm and they were both 10/10. The bread was excellent and the sandwiches were some of the best I've ever had in the strip. We also got a side of meatballs, almost as a precursor to see how dinner would be, and they were delicious. This place is great all around. Can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious all around. Great breakfast sandwich. Fantastic dinner and dessert. Good service. I always recommend!"}
{"text":"Today, I visited DiAnoia's for the second time.  Both visits have been extraordinary.  We started both meals off with freshly baked bread in olive oil and Parmesan cheese.  It's the perfect way to start the meal.  Tonight, I got the gnocchi with meatballs.  Last time I got the gnocchi, Sorrentina Style, which is placed inside a warm bread bowl with tons of cheese for an additional $10. I couldn't stray from the gnocchi on my second visit as I loved it so much during my first visit.  I did happen to get a bite of my sister in law's sausage and apple rigatoni, which was equally as tasty.  Something that's always a big bonus is having vegetarian options, as my wife is a vegetarian.  They don't have a ton of vegetarian choices, but the ones they do have are remarkable.  We got the Zeppoles for dessert during both visits, which are freshly made, soft, warm doughnuts covered in powdered sugar and we also got the Tiramisu to split.  The coffee taste was a little strong for my liking, but I still thought it was incredibly high quality. So far, DiAnoia's has hit it out of the park each time.  I hope to go back again soon, and try something new.  I have no reason to give these guys anything other than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"DiAnoia's is solid, but has been hit or miss as I've been a couple of times. The breakfast sandwich was great. Look forward to giving it more visits."}
{"text":"Was there for an afternoon snack before a dinner party. The interior is new and unique. I like the color bottle chandliers and wine glass chandliera. Service is quick. We placed the order at the counter and picked a table of our choice. Coming to the menu, I didnot find many interesting panini options for vegetarians. So, we ended up having roasted cauliflower and whipped ricotta. Photos are available. 

Roasted cauliflower is tasty. It is cauliflower with melted cheese and topped with pesto and toasted pinenuts. They are a good combination and we liked the dish especially the pinenuts! Coming to the whipped ricotta, I was impressed by the Walnut toppings on the ricotta. It is served with some toasted bread. It is unfortunate that when they served the bread it was burnt and they still decided to go ahead and serve it! But, I should also mention that they replaced it with well toasted bread (photo available) when we requested for another plate. Still, I would expect them to notice such things before they bring it to the customer's table. 

Overall, for my taste preference, this is an okay place which is overrated."}
