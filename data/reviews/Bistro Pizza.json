{"text":"Staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas for our annual summer trip when we craved some pizza. So I yelped pizza and Bistro came up with the best reviews so we decided to give it a try. 

The pizza was so good with the most perfect crust. My husband had their spaghetti /meatballs and  really enjoyed it. The food was good and so was the service. The young guys behind the counter were really nice and just friendly.... Had to find in chain restaurants nowadays. 

Will definitely go back when we're in town."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing homemade marinara, best garlic knots I've had, and $9 with will last 3 meals for me. We came in for lunch on a Thursday and the one guy behind the counter gracefully balanced taking orders, cooking (even tossing dough and stuff) and bringing everyone's stuff out, and chatting with the regulars. Indulgent, great value, a real winner."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Bistro!!! I showed up tonight around 8:25pm with my two kids for dinner. The guys in the back were cleaning up and getting ready to close. They welcomed us into the restaurant, and made our dinner. We ate in Bistro tonight and the Staff was polite, service was awesome, and didn't rush us out. I love this little local place and we eat her often. They never disappoint!!! Bistro is a must add to your list!!




We LOVE this place!! We eat at Bistro weekly and we're never disappointed!  My family loves the garlic knots, bistro sliders, bistro salad, pizza and the lasagna rocks!!! I used them for catering last Feb and everyone raved about the food!!! We can't get enough of this place!! It's nice to have great quality food and service in our backyard!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way, this place ain't cheap, nor should they be. The pizza tastes amazing, try it out you won't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Very cheesy! With just the right amount of sauce.  Wonderful customer service!  Delicious garlic knots -- spinach and artichoke dip the best! Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Not the best location, it's hidden in a small strip mall but I will say the pizza is excellent! I will order with them again"}
{"text":"AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING FOOD!!! Everything on the menu is DELICIOUS! The service is great and the owner is AMAZING! Prices are very good, best Pizza in Vegas yet! Try there Stromboli's, Bistro Salad and Sliders; it is to die for! Basically try everything on the menu when you get a chance, because you will be surprise by the amount of flavors in each bite. The food is ADDICTIVE, so be careful ladies!  Will definitely come back and would recommend this to EVERYBODY!"}
{"text":"The ricotta, ham and pineapple pizza and lasagna we ordered were both very tasty. The complimentary side of garlic knots was a very nice (and delicious) touch as well! We will definitely be back because the food was great and the customer service was stellar!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great pizza.  Great wings.  Great garlic knots.  This is one of the best pizza places in Las Vegas.  

I prefer Bistro to Metro."}
{"text":"Bistro Pizza is a small joint tucked away in a strip mall. You'd never expect to get such good pizza there. I usually go here for the garlic knots. I also get the cheese pizza, which has more of an oregano flavor then other pizza spots in town."}
{"text":"Levelle and Tyler did an awesome job ! I got chicken fingers and fries and garlic knots , all perfect !"}
{"text":"The chicken parm garlic knots are amazing! Actually all the food is great! The service was fast and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The masses were right, the garlic knots were fantastic also ordered a pizza with extra cheese family enjoyed it also. Wife ordered Tuscan chicken loved it. First time here nice to have a great pizza joint close by. Staff real friendly also."}
{"text":"i was excited to try this pizza place after reading about it on facebook.
(please bear with me, this is my first yelp review)

ambiance: casual pizza-place decor. there was a scrabble game going on one of the tables in the front, i liked that.

service: wonderful. i did take out, so i walked right up to the counter where there was only one guy working. he was incredibly friendly and helped us pick out what to order while preparing other people's orders. i enjoy watching the cooking process so it was interesting to watch my food being made.

food: we ordered a stromboli and a large pizza.

stromboli: my friend described it as a \"bad ass hot pocket\". we ordered \"the thaddius\" which was cheese, marinara, ham, sausage, pepperoni and salami wrapped in dough. it is also served with a side of marinara sauce to dip in. it is cut in two, so great to split for 2 people. (the thaddius was $10)

pizza: we ordered half chicken half pineapple. both were delicious, the cheese melts beautifully and tastes wonderful. the dough is crispy on the outside but nice and soft in the middle. the amount of toppings we got (both chicken and pineapple) was very generous. all ingredients were very fresh.

i will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I found this place by chance after driving by the plaza. Came in for lunch. Honestly this is probably the best pizza in all of Las Vegas and it's super affordable! I got a calzone with pepperoni and an order of garlic knots. It was delicious I would definitely recommend this to any one. And I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome! This pizza reminds me when I was a kid. This is the pizza I've been looking for. Just the right amount of cheese, sauce, and toppings. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"We came to Henderson just to spend the night on the way home from a Grand Canyon vacation trip. Found Bistro Pizza in our Entertainment Discount app. What a find! Awesome pizza. The garlic knots were devoured by the kids. And the wings.....absolutely the best ever. They were cooked to perfection. The sweet spicy sauce was a hit too."}
{"text":"I want to start this review telling all you lazy a$$ mo fo's to get off your lazy butts and stop complaining that they don't have delivery! This is a disgrace how lazy someone would have to be to give a bad review because YOU'RE lazy. 

Now everyone should be aware that the pizza here is pretty decent for a mom and pop pizza shop. I will admit I've had better but that's not why I am giving them 5 stars. The 5 stars is soley due to Tyler. This guys knows customer service. I have been doing retail customer service for 15 years and it's rare to see it at this level. Only will you receive this level of service when you do not use a chain for your pizza. 

I placed an order over the phone and when I picked it up, one pizza had spinach when I asked for sausage. Without thinking twice Tyler asked if we had 15 minutes because he wanted to makes is another pizza that was what we ordered. He didn't even give me time to think about being upset or disgruntled over the situation.  Now I know someone reading this is thinking,  \"why didn't they just get it right the first time?\" If that's the case then you should not be eating out. EVER! You can't simply tell me you have always had your order right everytime youve eaten out?? People make mistakes. We are all capable of them. Its how we correct them that sets us apart. 

Don't take my word for it. Keep reading more reviews. You will notice he personally responds to any review with 3 stars or less. Your satisfaction is extremely important to him!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is amazing, staff treats you like family. Friendly atmosphere for family's with kids."}
{"text":"Great sliders and garlic knots!  The day we went in they had a 'imited menu'. Most of the items on the menu weren't available. Ordered a cheese pizza the next day. Much too cheesy for us."}
{"text":"Ordered two piazzas for pickup same thing I always order, large pepperoni and a large sausage and garlic. Picked it up got home and had two pepperoni. My fault for not checking at the shop. Called to let them know, sounded like the broad at the counter didn't care and it was my fault. Did offer 50% off next pie but whatever. Pie is decent customer service not great."}
{"text":"Our first visit this week - Cheese Pie, garlic knockers, spaghetti & meat balls, salad, and calzone - all perfect.  Friendly and responsive staff!  We'll be back the next time in town!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Bistro for years now and can honestly say I have only had positive experiences! The food is always DELICIOUS, the atmosphere is always welcoming, and the crew rocks. If you're looking for a place to get your grub on, this is definitely the place to come!"}
{"text":"Love the food. The employees are always extremely friendly! The pizza is great! Spaghetti and meatballs with salad and garlic knots is also great."}
{"text":"Great pizza my wife an I love the style of pizza they bring to Vegas"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the the southeast side of town. Located in a fairly old shopping center on Gibson off of the 215, you wouldn't expect this kind of quality from this unlikely place. It's tucked right behind a gas station in a residential area. We found this place because we wanted an alternative to the high-priced Grimaldi's. 

My family and I like the meatball pizza. In comparison to Verrazanos and New York Pizza (on Jones and Sahara), Bistro proves to be arguably superior. HOWEVER, Grimaldi's is still the best in Vegas imo. I just can't stand paying $35 for a pizza, which is why Bistro gets most of my business when I want a pie. 

To sum up my review, Bistro is proving to be the best of Las Vegas and Henderson. For the quality you get in a Bistro pizza, you can't beat the value. 

Dont forget to CHECK IN and get your FREE GARLIC KNOTS."}
{"text":"We had the sausage and ham pizza with an order of the garlic knots.  They were fantastic.    Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome everything.  My wife and I have eaten there a few times, and we have yet to find something we don't like.  Portion sizes are just a bit larger than perfect.  I always leave full and happy.  The house salad dressing is perfect.  Don't change a thing!  Gotta love those bistro fries!"}
{"text":"Were from Utah down in vegas for vacation. We decided to get off the strip to have some real deal incredible food. This place has some real nice guys working here. The food is fresh and you can see it being made before your eyes. They have a awesome focus on quality. Absolutely a must stop for anyone in the Vegas area!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Stumbled on this gem. AMAZING calzone and spaghetti. Can't wait to make the trek from the far northwest to eat here again!!! Wishing we lived closer to become a regular (they seem to have a lot of them). If you're near here and want a great meal for a great deal from some great people...go to Bistro Pizza!!! Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and Garlic knots are solid. Highly recommended if you're short on time and have a craving for pizza."}
{"text":"Bistro Pizza is a really good choice if you are looking for good food at a good price.  So far, I've had the Thaddeus stromboli which is a meat lovers dream.  This place is new and should be given a chance.  I am sure any and all will be glad they did.  Also, they have a great promotion; if you save your receipt and come back within four days of purchase, your next meal is half off."}
{"text":"The very best pizza here in Vegas.  Anyone that has lived in the Midwest knows good pizza and you just can't find it here.....until you go to Bistro.  Outstanding cheese and sauce!  Lets not forget to mention that they place \"plenty of items\" on the pizza.  More than any other place around.  So anyone from the Midwest looking again to find that great taste.....you must try this place."}
{"text":"This place is the spot! We get a pineapple and mushroom pizza and fries usually, plus the garlic knots (which are the ish). The bistro fries are delicious and so are the fries with gravy. This place is always on point with flavor and display. It looks as good as I taste. I'd suggest this place if your looking for some good pizza"}
{"text":"I personally like this place a lot better than other pizza places in this neighborhood. Pizza here is not salty at all, but very good flavor. This place will be my all time favorite from now! :)"}
{"text":"Great local place with a super attentive and friendly staff.  Good food and great pizza and super great garlic knots!  Yum yum"}
{"text":"Great smell as soon as I walked in. Took me a second to figure out that it was a seat yourself spot. One of the employees came over and instructed us on what to do and we were all good at that point. The food was hot, tasty, and plenty of it to boot! Not a marinara fan, so we get everything with white sauce of some sort. It wasnt quite as thick as I expected but the flavor was wonderful. Drove 10 miles to come here on purpose and im not disappointed at all. My family and I Will Be Back!"}
{"text":"First time trying the pizza place just around the corner. We ordered almost everything on he menu and everything was great!! Meatball sliders on garlic knots!!?? Need I say more. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner is super cool, the workers are always attentive, and the food is delicious and on time. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So lucky this place is within walking distance to my house.  Great pizza.  Worth the try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I have to say without any qualifiers, this is the best pizza I've eaten in town. Hell, maybe the best I've eaten in my life. The pizza itself is amazing, from the crust, to the sauce, to the toppings - done perfectly, and completely delicious.

The garlic knots are also amazing, as is the garlic bread. Are you sensing a theme here?

Luckily for me, they don't deliver all the time... The owner, and staff obviously care about what they're doing, and it shows. It's really refreshing to eat someplace where they actually take pride in what they're serving; that's a rare commodity these days."}
{"text":"Garlic knots were super good! I wanted to order the meatball sandwich but they were out of bread. The tomatoes in the salad were marinated and oh so yummy"}
{"text":"The pizza here was great!!! Love that it's a surprisingly delicious place! You would never notice this little gem unless stumbling upon it or from yelp. In my neighborhood and it's a great little mom and pop kinda place! The free garlic knots with the check-in were hot, fresh, and yummy!! We got meatball and sausage pizza and it did not disappoint either! My husband and I will definitely be back soon!! They also have a full italian menu as well, not just pizza!"}
{"text":"It was good. I've had a bunch and this the bomb! Do people still say that?? Price was right also."}
{"text":"This is now the second time eating here, I absolutley love this place the owner I believe his name is tylor Is very nice His customer service alone will make me return. Thank you buddy for the great food and such great service. I will definitlry return..."}
{"text":"First time here.  Came with family that had been here before.  Everything came out quickly.  The pizza was good but the garlic knots were outstanding.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious garlic knots!! Loved the pizza too. Second time at Bistro & still loved the food and service. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"This is really fine, handmade pizza.  There are the high end foo foo pizzas at many places and they can be interesting, but when you are craving an honest earnest pie this is the bomb.  My bar for this being from the east coast originally is Manco and Manco's pizza on the boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ.  Fresh dough that is hand stretched and homemade as is the sauce, flavorful but not overhwhelming oregano or other spices, and tasty toppings.  They have all that here and it is the closest to Manco and Manco's I have found so far in the west.  The pizza is cooked so the dough has a crisp edge but just the right amount of chewiness.  Great cheese and not so much as to be gloppy.  I wish we had opportunity to try more of their offerings, the kids weren't very adventurous and we only did a half pepperoni and half black olive.  Next trip I guess!  The chef and the staff was very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in providing a superior product and assuring a satisfied customer.  Location is in a strip mall, basic walk in pizzeria with some booths easy to find off the 215 freeway and the sign on the street just says Pizza.  We did miss the part that they are closed on Tuesday so had to make a second trip on Wednesday but very glad we did.  They don't serve alchohol but you are a fool if you pass up this pizza and the very nice people that make it over that."}
{"text":"Every menu item I've tried is awesome.  Made to order with TLC.  Tyler takes pride in his craft, and I never leave disappointed.  As stated before, garlic knots, pizza, and lasagna are especially good.  TRY IT, you will become a regular."}
{"text":"garlic knots sooo good. Loved the pizza. Just a nice neighborhood place to eat good food."}
{"text":"You have to give credit where credit is due.  I've come to this place several times and everything I've had was excellent.  The garlic knots and the pizza were cooked to perfection and I highly recommend them!  

On top of that, the owner is friendly and offers great service.  I called in an order at closing time and he happily took my order and told me that it be would ready in a few minutes.  By the time I got there, my spaghetti and meatballs were cooked fresh and ready to go."}
{"text":"We have been here about 10 times now and have always had great service, and excellent food. The quality is consistent and fresh. We have tried just about everything as we usually eat here as a family or bring friends. Excellent  pizza, fresh salads, awesome  meatballs, strombolli, lasagne.  Even though the staff is young they are all friendly and well mannered and seem to truly  care about doing  a great job - very refreshing."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Try the garic knots. Say hi to the owner Tyler, he's cooking the tasty food your eating."}
{"text":"First visit created a few  impressions: 
1) are we in the right place? (Having recently relocated to Henderson, I am still not used to the concept of a non chain, locally owned restaurant located a strip mall.) 
2). The 'atmosphere' of the place is emphatically informal. Almost to the point that it almost felt like we were sitting in the kitchen, looking over the shoulder of the staff.
3) The staff was great. Let us take all the time we needed to get familiar with the menu, etc.
4) We had pizza, salads and a pasta dish. All were simply outstanding. Makes my mouth water just writing about the food. And of course the garlic knots-wow.

We will eagerly return to this funky, delicious, and friendly little gem of a an restaurant."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good wings, great garlic knots. A good garlic white sauce is available on the pizza if you want. Tyler is very friendly and accommodating, he even gave us a couple of cinnamon caramel knots for dessert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time here and just amazing as the first. Owner operated. You order at the counter get your own drink and they bring the food to you."}
{"text":"You guy's are awesome! I love the pizza, the friendly staff, oh! And the Bistro fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the baked pasta, garlic knots, side salad, and small rasberry gelato all for 18 bucks. Great deal for great food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Looking for a quality pizza place that delivers to a hotel, I found Bistro Pizza from Yelp.  Other than waiting a bit longer for them to deliver the pizza, it was absoutely delicious with fresh ingredients & full of flavor ( we did get fresh garlic). We are moving here, so I know I will buy pizza from Bistro Pizza whenever we are craving pizza (which is often)!"}
{"text":"We were in town and looking for a place to eat.  Yelp did not steer us wrong.  When you arrive, the outside is not imposing as it is in a strip mall, however the food is good and reasonable.  I ordered lasagna (after they checked to make sure they still had some).  I was lucky, they did.  All told we had the chicken alfredo, pizza, lasagna, garlic knots and salad along with kids meal pizza.  Temp little high inside for us, but we not from here and it could be us, everything is hot to us. Give this place a try, I think you will be happy."}
{"text":"Dang, that's some killer pizza!!! Super friendly fellas, and funny to boot. The music playing in this joint is off the hook. MC Hammer, WHAT! Yassssss!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots were buttery garlicky goodness, served with a side of marinara.  Salad was fresh crisp mixed greens with a generous portion of chopped tomatoes marinated in a balsamic vinagrette.  We ordered chicken parmesan and  pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The chicken was not breaded but moist and delicous with a good tomato sauce. The pizza dough was seasoned and cooked well. Mushrooms appear to be sauteed beforehand and not just thrown on the pizza.  The chef, (possibly owner?) greeted us right away and was very friendly.   Looks like we found ourselves a nice little neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"Close as you can get to a New York Pizza..everything fresh and cooked to perfection.  I had a pepperoni  pizza with half black olives and onions and we ordered the garlic knots that were awesome and just out of the oven.
I am fussy when it comes to Pizza..Tyler is great I will be back..thank you for the quick and friendly service also.  
Facebook friends need to try this pizza..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza. The ingredients are always fresh, and the staff is always very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hands down! Great quality pizza at a fair price."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Gluten Free Pizza!!!  My husband is a fan of the Fettuccine Alfredo, Chicken Parm and Lasagna.  Owner goes out of his way to make you happy.  Other staff is so -so if he is not there."}
{"text":"Only place I come to when I'm in the mood for pizza near Vegas. Well its the only pizza place I've been to but NON THE LESS! The fact you can draw on the table gives it a more of a uniqueness to it."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought our kiddos here for pizza last night.  The staff was friendly and we were immediately greeted at the door.  After placing the order of garlic knots (yum!), ham & mushroom pizza, and a sausage & pepperoni, we got to color \"on the table\".  It's a nice touch for kiddos (and adults) who like to have something to while we wait.

Our garlic knots came quickly!  They were buttery, crispy on the outside, and doughy (not in the \"undercooked\" doughy category, the just right category).  They tasted amazing with the marinara sauce!

Not long after, our pizzas came!  They were so delicious! Crispy and chewy at the same time.  I thought it had the perfect amount of sauce.  My hubby mentioned he would have liked a bit more sauce.  I'm sure he could order it with more!

Thanks, Bistro Pizza!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Las Vegas, my daughter and I have been looking for a really good pizza place.  And we have finally found it!  From the warm and delicious garlic knots to the pepperoni pizza, this is definitely become our favorite place!"}
{"text":"I went in to place an order today after discovering Bistro Pizza on Yelp. The staff was friendly and offered a warm greeting. After browsing the menu I decided to order the baked penne, a stromboli, pep pizza and garlic knots. The quoted wait time for my order was accurate (I left to go pick up my daughter from school down the street). I asked for ranch with the salad that came with the penne. Once the order was ready I asked again if the ranch was in the container with the salad and I was told it was. I did not check the order but was disappointed when I got home to find that the stromboli was missing and there was no ranch for my salad and it was tossed in a balsamic dressing :( So, i called the Bistro and they were apologetic and offered me a free stromboli (or the one I paid for and didn't get) for my next visit. The food was very good though."}
{"text":"I was craving Pizza on my way home from work and noticed Bistro Pizza in the strip center at Gibson and 215 (just south of 215).  The place had a warm inviting feel to it.  The guy working was really cool.  While he was making the pizza, he invited me to help myself to a drink (on the house).  Great customer service.  It was weird going to a place where the person working was friendly and nice.  p.s.  The pizza was yummy and tasted great warmed up the next day."}
{"text":"So, as you can see from my previous review, the owner of this pizza parlor, Tyler, responded and offered me the garlic knots that I didn't get to try my first time. It's so cool that he cares enough about the reviews and took the time to respond back to me. So we went and I got the pleasure of meeting this awesome guy! Tyler is so welcoming, down-to-earth and just a really nice guy! He immediately got started on my garlic knots and they were the best damn garlic knots I've ever had!! They literally melt in your mouth!! Those knots had me dancing in my seat to the cool music that was playing. If you're in the neighborhood or even if you're NOT in the neighborhood, you MUST indulge at Bistro Pizza! Make it a requirement. You owe it to yourself to try this place out. From the moment you walk in, the staff makes you feel welcome and that's hard to come by these days. The pizza is awesome, the garlic knots are awesome, the staff is awesome and the owner Tyler is awesome. We'll definitely be back to work our way down the menu and try some other items! Thanks again Tyler!"}
{"text":"Just great Pizza! The best pizza I've had in years, consistently good. The meatballs are an added bonus. Not the cheapest, but shouldn't be for this quality. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Had a little meatball & ricotta pizza and I gotta say....\"YUM!!\"   Thanks for that suggestion previous yelper.  This was my first visit and I'll definitely be back!  This is not your avg pizza joint."}
{"text":"I give up. Bistro Pizza has the best pizza in Green Valley. I have tried and failed in finding some other amazing pizza place that would deliver to my house. Really, really wanted to love another because I am that lazy. No joy. 

You win Bistro Pizza. I'll come to you."}
{"text":"I love this place and they continue to impress! The one place I saw a need for improvement was in their salad department. Tyler responded on my review and said they would be rolling out some seasonal salad soon. My next visit there were two new salads on special. We got the BBQ chicken salad and it was delicious! The customer service is great there! Tyler really cares and does his best to make sure each customer is completely satisfied! Thanks Tyler!"}
{"text":"Good pie at a good price.  This to me is your typical medium thickness crust pizza, not too thin, not too thick, with a good balance between sauce, dough and cheese.  The cheese is not grease laden like the cheaper places throw at you (clears throat... Metro).  The only marginal gripe is that the sauce is a little bland and underwhelming but not a deal breaker.

Everyone loves the free 'check-in' knots, but it's just too much dough for me.  They're giant and tasty balls of dough that could be a meal unto themselves, but if that's your thing...  I feel like they're 4 stars and buying all the 5 stars with those knots... Hats off ;)"}
{"text":"Super nice staff and great tasting pizza.  

We were in a bind trying to find a pizza place that would be open at 11am for a birthday party.  I took a chance and called Bistro Pizza at 10:40am and someone answered and took my take out order.  I picked up my two large pizzas and they were a hit!!  Everyone was asking where I got the pizza from, and the small group ate every slice.

Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"A friend recommended it recently to us and we are hooked. It is now our go-to pizza place and everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Don't know how the food tastes because customer service was so horrible we cancelled our order. When we called in for a large pepperoni and fries (because of the great reviews), and garlic knots (free with yelp coupon) we were told they were out of knots and it would be 45 minutes for the pizza (pick up). We were also told he couldn't tell us the total because his system was down. We probably would have waited it out if he wasn't so rude."}
{"text":"After a few attempts to love this place- so far, the only thing I seem to enjoy here is the garlic knot sliders. I truly wish their homemade pizzas had me calling back for more, but the overly flour/chewy dough is lackluster and toppings mediocre. I was hoping to leave a more complimentary review but everyone has their pizza-style preference...I'll stick with Grimaldi's and Settebello."}
{"text":"After waiting for 2 weeks for this place to actually stay open past 4:00 on a Sunday, we finally went. Not bad but the pizza was a bit on the salty side. Crust was not memorable. The garlic knots smelled fantastic, and the flavor was good but they didn't seem like they had been baked long enough. All in all, a great place for local family spur of the moment pizza, but doesn't hold a candle to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"The toppings we had on our pizza was meatball sausage and ricotta cheese.  We had teriyaki wings and garlic knots.  So the garlic knots was good and buttery. I think they over baked mines but the flavor and softness still there. Teriyaki wings I liked cause it wasn't too tangy and I'm a suckah for wings anyways. The pizza was more on the thin crust side which was nice. Not too much bread.  The sauce and toppings tasted hella good. 

Customer service was ok. They was nice after I tipped but I guess that's how the world turns right.  They weren't the friendliest but they weren't the rudest.  

I need to come back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just found our new go to pizza joint. My wife and I stopped in Saturday evening to try this place out. We started off with sweet chili hot wings and garlic knots. The knots were fricken awesome. Perfect the way we love them. A bit of a crust on the outside and doughy and delicious on the inside with garlic butter drizzled over top served with a delicious marinara for dunking. A must get when you come here.   The wings were fantastic! Perfect crisp outside and moist and tender inside. I loved the sweet chili hot sauce too. So far 2 for 2....now the pie. We ordered a large onion, mushroom and meatball pizza. It came out steaming hot and absolutely loaded with toppings. We loved it!!! A perfect mix of a crisp bottom crust, sauce, tons of toppings and cheese. Could only eat two pices after we demolished the knots and wings but bonus on taking leftovers home.  Looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu but since we live so close, this place will definetly be our goto for pizza, wings and knots."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and the food... we had a lot.. spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, wings, pizza, garlic knots, chicken tenders and salads.. they were beyond delicious!! Recommend Bistro Pizza highly. So glad we found them!!!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots - AMAZING!  Pizza, just okay.  My mother's pizza on gluten free pizza dough was just horrible."}
{"text":"This place has amazing spinach artichoke dip with bacon and lots of artichoke for only $7. The service is exceptional. Make sure to check out their specials on their website."}
{"text":"Everything here is extra salty and doughy.  We ordered a strombolie which was very salty, An order of garlic knots which was extremely doughy,  a pizza and meatball sliders which was super salty. The saltiness of everything overpowers the flavor."}
{"text":"They have amazing garlic knots. They were so light and full of flavor. I will go back just for those alone. We also had a large pepperoni pizza that was amazing. Every time I come to Vegas bistro pizza is going to have to be on my list of stops now!"}
{"text":"We had a party and ordered 4 large pizzas and garlic knots to go. Everyone loved it.  Can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"The pizza here is top notch. The owner is there all the time. Aside from pizza, the restaurant serves garlic knots, a variety of pastas, and few other italian favorites. I've ordered pizzas and garlic knots for my son's birthday party a few times. The order has always arrived piping hot and right on time."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Best pizza we have had since my parents moved here 6 Years ago. Wish we would have found it sooner! Definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza you'll find in town, but for half the price of any competitor. When my wife and I moved to Henderson last August, we had nothing but the clothes on our back the first night, so we tried the first local pizza place we came across. We also had it our second night. It quickly became our favorite in town. Whenever we have guests, we always eat in or order a pizza or two to show off our favorite place.

Tyler, the owner and pizzaiolo, really knows how to make delicious food. The crust is perfectly thin where it needs to be, chewy enough where it should be, and tastes great. The sauce is nice and sweet, and hardy enough to stand up to spicy toppings. We always get our pizza with black olives and basil (FRESH basil, mind you - to die for), and a medium-size is typically enough for dinner for the two of us. If we are treating a friend or two, we'll get a large, sometimes with an order of the decadent garlic knots. The garlic knots are probably the best I've had anywhere - always perfectly cooked and scrumptious, if a little messy. But totally worth it. 

And to top all this off, it's extremely reasonably priced for the quality. Plus, I think every receipt is a coupon for half off your next pizza within 5 days. Also Tyler has a good memory for return customers, and clearly appreciates the business. Bottom line is, anyone living in or passing through Henderson has to give this place a try, or regret it."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! The garlic knots are delicious! Excellent flavors. 2 thumbs up! We ordered side salads and were very impressed as well. Wish we lived in town because we would frequent this place. We tried it based on Yelp recommendations and we were not disappointed. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Free garlic knots with \"check in\"! They were delicious, as was the pizza. We got a large pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. It had a nice chewy crust, fresh tasting tomato sauce and stringy yummy cheese. Three thumbs up from this family! I just wish this place was in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Bistro Pizza is a great local pizza place. Touro students get a large 1-topping pizza for $10 and the pizza is L-A-R-G-E.

On days that I want to take my lounging to extremes, I order takeout from Bistro Pizza plus garlic knots. I hate myself for eating an entire pizza myself, but the experience is worth sharing with all of you if it means that they can gain customers on my loss of hope in my future beach body. The pizza is very delicious, the flavor is as you would expect from a pizza, cheesy with the right amount of toppings. The sausage is plain enough for you to taste the sausage and not over-salted or over-cooked like some establishments will do. At Bistro Pizza your pizza is made just the way you want it.  The garlic knots are a good complement to my pizza and an effective nail into the proverbial coffin that is my New Years resolutions.

Bistro pizza even has board games if you want to eat your pizza with friends (of course I didn't go with that option). Their service is friendly as you'd find at most pizza places, but I liked Bistro Pizza mainly because it's across the street.

For a guilt-free experience in getting good pizza, be sure to check out Bistro Pizza and enjoy your night of delicious sausage pizza and self-reflection."}
{"text":"Found this spot on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot since we were just passing through. I'm glad we did! It was awesome :) The chicken Parmesan was wonderful (I particularly liked the taste of the marinara) and I would highly recommend upgrading to the bistro fries! Both were delicious, and not only was the food great, but the service was fantastic. The guys working were very tentative and friendly, and were completely on it! You can also draw on the wax papers at the tables, so that was fun!"}
{"text":"Another guy left a great feedback about a meatball and Ricotta pizza.  I took his lead and got the same thing.  Probably the best pizza I have ever had.  Delivered HOT to me in 35 mins, was a great topping selection.  

The only way to improve this is to add Basil and Oregano to the top.  I asked and they were out.  Add basil and Oregano you will love this pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided on Bistro because of the reviews on Yelp. Glad we did! This pizza is delish! The garlic knots are OMG good! We will be regulars from now on. Oh, the service was great too. Very friendly and they have a couple tables outside which I like."}
{"text":"Okay, these 2 stars are for the pizza. IMO the pizza sauce is lackluster in favor, more like tomato paste. The pepperoni slices are a bit too thin as well. Coverage was good but overall the lack of favor did it for me. Now, the garlic knots on the other hand get 5 stars!, these little buns are full of favor and definitely worth a trip for.
Next time I'll try a pasta dish, they do have a good selection of items on their menu. Very friendly and hard working staff."}
{"text":"Bistro Pizza is my type of pizza joint. I'm more of a thin-crust pizza type of person so the toppings & flavoring don't all get lost in the breading. Bistro's pizza is nice and thin with the right amount of toppings and cheese. I probably will ask for less tomato sauce next time, but that's just me since I'm not into a ton of tomato sauce. I loved the pepperoni and sausage, which reminded me a bit of Round Table Pizza--a favorite pizza place of mine in California. However, Bistro's was much better. I tried the meatball with garlic, but the meatballs had a slight gamey taste. Otherwise, it wasn't too bad. Overall, I really enjoyed the pizza and absolutely loved the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint we've found in years. Love the food, the family atmosphere, and the BREAD KNOTS. Pretty sure they must put something illegal in them..."}
{"text":"If there was negative stars this place would get it. Walked in, one person working so we seated ourselves. Another employee comes in the front door, still no service. After 5 minutes of not even being acknowledged we got up and left. Terrible!!!  Never be back."}
{"text":"I heard this is the best pizza in Henderson and it lived up to the hype. So good!!! We shared a large pizza (two of us) and it was more than enough. The garlic bites are amazing. The crust is cooked perfectly and our order of a half and half came out with no mistakes. They certainly don't skimp on the toppings either."}
{"text":"Agreed Bistro Pizza fits the niche for awesome and affordable pizza. The menu is perfect and balanced with yummy goodness! We are soooo lucky to have B. P. So close!!!!"}
{"text":"Had their ghost fries and Stromboli and it was absolutely amazing. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is in a strip mall. Dined in , friendly, fast service liked the butcher paper on the tables w/ crayons. Drew a picture, played tic tac toe while waiting for food. 
Ordered a pepperoni pizza, nicely cooked thick crust."}
{"text":"I eat at Bistro at least twice a week! The closest you can get to NYC pizza without actually flying there. The cheese is ooey gooey and flavored so well! The crust is perfect thickness to support all the toppings one could want. And the sauce, often overlooked at pizza parlors, is phenomenal at bistro! In conclusion, looking for a good pizza? Bistro should be your first and last stop when in Vegas/Henderson!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing crust! Just the right amount of crunch. Stop in, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. We got calzones and they had a good amount of meat in them. The kids enjoyed the pizza. The two ladies running it were polite and the food was ready quickly."}
{"text":"Wanting to try out a pizza place I hadn't tried before, I opted for Bistro. I was not disappointed! I ordered the ricotta and meatball pizza. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. 

I opted for carry out. I arrived a little early and they offered me a free drink while I waited. The guy who was running the register, who I assumed was the manager, was super friendly. 
When he brought me my pizza, I opened it up to look at it. It wasn't that I thought it might be messed up, I just love pizza and wanted to see it! It looked great!

On my way out, he thanked me again and warned me against the dangers of eating and driving. :)

The reason for the four stars, and not a perfect review, is due to the pizza crust. It was too tough for my liking. 

Crust aside, I will absolutely go back and will recommend to all of my friends. Great staff and really good food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is excellent and so is the staff. The garlic knots are to die for and their take out specials are great!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pizza joint. It reminds me a lot of a pizza place I used to frequent in Brooklyn. My girlfriend and I were in Henderson and had a pizza craving. We found the place easily  (right off the freeway) and dined in. The staff was friendly and seemed in pretty good moods kind of joking around and singing along to some songs. We got the bistro fries, garlic knots and a large pepperoni & sausage. I specifically asked if it was fresh sausage as I don't care for the sliced or frozen type and it was the good fresh stuff. The food was great! My girlfriend normally is not a big pizza fan and she said it was probably the best pizza she has had in Vegas. The fries were gone almost instantly. The garlic knots were warm and I found it hard to not eat them all. The large pizza was huge and delicious. It was such big portiins we ended up taking most of the pizza home. In summary, great east coast style pizza, fun staff, easy to get to, huge portions, delicious!

We have been a couple times since and while the service is still tip notch, the food hasn't always been quite as good. For sure get the garlic knots and fries though."}
{"text":"First time visit because of the Yelp rating. I seriously doubt that this rating is a result of legitimate reviews.

SERVICE: First off, the big guy who seemed to be the manager on duty was very impersonal; no smile, no enthusiasm and answered our questions in a cold, insensitive manner. This really made our whole experience even more disappointing.

FOOD: The food is over-priced for its portions and low quality. I've never seen a Parmesan cheese so powdery that it truly is just flavored sawdust. The spaghetti with meatballs were watery with just enough sauce to lightly cover the pasta which was again of very poor quality. I ordered 2 extra meatballs for $3 only to find that they are the size of a ping pong ball. I cut into the $10 spinach calzone to find it was mostly air with a bottom layer of ingredients. Again, $10 stromboli was all dough and no meat.

OVERALL: The whole place was dirty and grimy. The dishes and utensils we used had to be wiped off. We ended up ordering soda because the water glasses were layered with grime and fingerprints. The combination of overpricing, very poor quality ingredients, ridiculous portion skimping and cleanliness is disastrous."}
{"text":"Still eating here regularly, food is top notch, tasty as ever. Super impressed with consistency. Usually after the newness wears off, the food can begin to taper off, but not here. Still our favorite !"}
{"text":"This is a five star overall.  Great portions, great food, great prices.  I'm coming from out of town, but I will be back every time I'm in the area.  Great for the family!  Negative would be the size of the place...pray you find an open seat.  I only found the place because of reward program, but GREAT find it was."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup from here to try it out since we found it on Yelp. I ordered chicken Parmesan sandwich with bistro fries and my husband ordered a sausage and pepperoni calzone. We both loved our food especially the bistro fries! We seen on the bottom of the receipt the half price pizza if we return within 3 days which we are planning to do."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  We had our food delivered and it was amazing! Loved the meatball sliders and the bistro salad.  I also loved that we could order a kid sized pizza for my son, the picky eater, and still get a full sized white pizza for ourselves.  We usually end up getting two full size pizzas, which is way too much food and money.  The garlic knots were great and we loved the marinara.  Everything was very gourmet for a pizza place.  Like nothing we have ever experienced before.  And this was, hands down, the hottest delivery food I have ever received.  I don't know how they did it, but it was like we ordered it in the restaurant.  Great experience.  We won't order from anywhere else anymore.  Thank you Bistro Pizza!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. stopped by this place totally based on yelp reviews during a trip to Vegas, after driving back from the Hoover Dam. It was so great, we talked about it all weekend and ended up picking up a pizza to go before heading to the airport! Garlic knots are incredible. Calzone is huge. White pizza was so, so good. Between several of us, we sampled many entrees and appetizers and everything was fantastic. We've told all our friends and sent them to Bistro Pizza when they visit Vegas. You won't regret the detour from the Strip."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. We tried the poutine gravy fries, meatball garlic knot sliders, and the chicken wings. Service was EXCEPTIONAL, and while waiting for your food you can look at all the cute drawings on the wall, which are saved from the paper table coverings that customers can draw on with crayons. The food was brought to our table quickly, hot, fresh, and delish. I will definitely be back here to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Wow!  After taking out my dinner my car instantly filled with garlic smell and right then and there I knew I would be in love.  ... and it was LOVE!   The chicken parmesan sliders were amazing and the garlic knots out of this world.   Not to mention, the Yelp check in got me a free order of the knots ... SCORE!  Pizza was delish as well.  Only bummer is they didn't offer delivery tonight due to car issues, however, I'm glad I decided to pick up.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food... Great prices... Ill definitely be eating here more often. Garlic knots are amazing.... The sliders are delicious and they have fast delivery! It is hard to find good places that deliver to the bar I bartend at... Gold Mine Tavern so I am happy to reccomend Bistro to my guests for food."}
{"text":"Super awesome pizza place on the east side of henderson near the gibson rd and 215. I just had their calzone. Wow! Mikey likey. 

This is the way I like my chicken wings. Super crispy on the outside, tender meat on the inside, tasty spicy chili sauce.

It was their veggie lover's calzone, the secret is in the dough, it was full of flavor, crispy on the outside, soft middle, well seasoned. The cheese was terrific as well as the fresh vegetables inside.

If you like Metro style pizza, and if you like supporting great local business's, you gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"After church we were super hungry and craving an awesome pizza slice. We came across Bistro Pizza through searching yelp and sorting by rating. With a good average in reviews, we thought we would give it a shot. 

It's always a challenge to eat at pizza places when it's just me and my daughter.  Pizzas are too large and we end up taking most of it home. So we ordered a medium which was likely going to lead to us being able to take some home for a later meal. Didn't mind that idea with the other photos of pizza I've seen here. 

We wanted to redeem the free garlic knots but a large was too aggressive for us. He let us do it anyway because with all of our toppings we exceeded the price of a large 1 topping.  Woohoo!

The garlic knots arrived first, super hot but smelling so delicious it was hard to have patience and wait for them to cool off!  Garlic knots were so amazing!  Loved them! 

Pizza came out quickly and we dove right in. The cheese dripped from the slice as we picked it up...always an indication that this pizza was gonna be AWESOME!!! ...and it definitely was. 

Overall, the food was amazing"}
{"text":"There are not very many options for lunch in this area so I accidently found this lil spot, great customer service! Meatball sliders  and small pizza were yummy and you can't beat the lunch prices.  
Will definitely return to try other menu stuff
*check in for free garlic knots"}
{"text":"Alright I definetly got my fix! Let me start with service, it was great! Tyler I assume the guy behind the cash register was pretty welcoming, he gave us extra cups for the kids, restaurant is clean, they have paper table covers for kids and big kids to doddle, oh and game boards too! 
OK, let's get to the food part... we got the WET FRIES, and got demolished! Did I mention that the fries are swimming on a delicious gravy and topped with long stretchy cheese! Yes I definitely recommend this. We got the free garlic knots from yelp, it was really good too. It has that crunchy top and soft middle. My husband ordered the veggie stromboli with chicken, he liked it ok, he wasn't crazy about it but he liked the fresh red peppers and mushrooms. Then I got the lasagne which took a little bit longer to get to our table. I'm almost full when I got it. So I asked them to put it in a to go box. I tried a little, maybe I was too full I didn't really care for it too much. 
Over all I like this place, and will come back to try other stuff in their menu."}
{"text":"Whenever someone brings up a down-to-earth pizza joint, this is the place I will first think of. 
Honestly not a big pizza fan after consuming a large amount of Pizza Hut and Papa John's as a child into young adult years - a go-to whenever my parents weren't into the idea of cooking for the family or it was too late to have dinner at a decent hour. Anyway...
Friendly and personable guys, and the setting definitely wasn't intimidating. Hahaha... To pass the time, silly boyfriend got me a wine book to check out while we waited for the food. He also got a bit kiddie and drew on the table's paper covering with crayons. Also appreciated the hip hop, rap, R&B playing in the background. 
Let's see... Loved the fresh-outta-the-oven pepperoni and sausage pizza. I think the boyfriend mentioned that the sausage was made in-house too. It's the type of pizza you should fold to eat, and you can see the glisten of grease on the top. LOL. Not good as part of a regular diet, but it sure tastes yummy and I would consider a signature of pizza. Also enjoyed their garlic knots, and I pretty much devoured their bistro fries. 
Hahaha... If the boyfriend ever wants me to eat pizza with him again, he'd have to agree to go here."}
{"text":"***Heads up, the free Garlic Knots are not available for free with just a check in, I was informed I had to buy a large pizza in order to receive!***"}
{"text":"Garlic knots were perfect! Doughy center with garlic butter mmmmm.
Ghost fries were ok. Fries tossed in ghost chili seasoning. 
Cheese n spinach pizza delicious.  The crust to ingredients ratio was spot on. 
Def coming back"}
{"text":"We came here to grab lunch between Soccer games. We ordered Teriyaki wings, garlic cheese bread, and Italian pasta carzone. They were all perfectly cooked and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great hidden away pizza joint!  I personally like New York style but I have been known to be convinced otherwise depending on the pie maker.  I am picky with the dough and sauce and then the cheese follows and last the toppings. So if all goes well I have discovered a new favorite and Bistro Pizza just does it right!.  

We ordered a half white with mushrooms and basil, and a half pepperoni, salami, and pineapple and enjoyed each bite until the last one.   

They also have a great Yelp check in offer which takes a percentage off a large pizza so make sure to check in before ordering.  The place is also very inviting and you can find books, magazines, and board games"}
{"text":"Pizza was good and the service was great Make sure to check in and get free garlic knots"}
{"text":"Best pizza place hands down!!! It's more than I usually pay for pizza but it is worth it. The meatball and ricotta is my favorite and their garlic knots are to die for. The are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Patel is fresh and light. The sauces are fresh tasty. Bistro has become my new local pizza favorite"}
{"text":"Very great pizza, crust is the best part and very crunchy. Best pizza around.  Not the biggest place so it's hard to find a seat.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood pizza joint. Happy that we can come to Bistro Pizza, chillax, have family time, or run into and catch up with Henderson locals and neighbors. You get to experience a real sense of community here and eat delicious pizza and them evil garlic knots!  I was hesitant to write that not so favorable update two months ago, but it was out of concern for BP's business.

Thanks to Tyler for replying back to me and addressing those issues.  I even got a text message from a friend whose on Yelp who told me to please let the owner know when she came to visit, that the employees were friendly and not goofing off. So noted.

Fast forward two months and couple ninja check in visits, BP crew rocks!  Proud of some of these young adults who not only have good work ethics, but a promising future in the culinary industry.
 
So catching up on the food aspect of this review, love the new (to me at least) specials, like that Chicken Angelo and stuffed shells! Good comfort food.

The side meatballs and garlic knots still taste great to me! Not sure what those latest two reviewers are talking about, then again I dont have that refined palate, can't tell real butter from \"Whirl\",  nor neither do I work in a \"professional restaurant \"  ....((Face Palm and Rolls Eyes))...

ICYMI on Yelp app - Yelp Tip - see their website for web specials! That's why I try to make it here on Sundays, gotta swing by and pick up that pizza deal for Mr. B!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow yelpers for checking in here!  I would have never known this little gem was so close to me!   We stopped in for a carb filled lunch and I'm so glad we did!  

Since it was our first visit, we had to look over the menu to make our decision.  It didn't take us long to start off with the garlic knots.  What goes good with garlic knots? Stromboli and Meatball sliders of course!  I don't know how much bread one can eat but we were going to see.  

Oh my YUM!  Garlic knots were fabulous with just the right amount of garlic and cheese.  As if we weren't already in heaven, the 'Thaddius' stromboli was staring at us.  It was filled with pepperoni, salami, ham and sausage.   The italian meats were absolutely flavorful, delicious and filling.   To put the cherry on top, their meatball sliders gave the competition a run for their money!  The meatball baked on their homemade garlic knot topped with mozzarella and sauce made this girl's stomach happy.  

We loved everything about this bistro!  The service was great and the food was even better!   I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday with a friend for lunch. Had the lasagna, it was AWESOME, served with a salad and a couple garlic knots which were delicious as well.  My friend got the buffalo sliders and Bistro fries, I tried a slider and it was really good too.  The menu prices were more than fair and the service was spot on perfect, especially for one guy who was doing the cooking and serving. I highly recommend you at least give it a try if you're in the Gibson and 215 area."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Awesome stromboli. Good prices. My boyfriend loves this place, he's become a regular. 

I am giving 3 stars because most of the time, Bistro gave us a good experience. After hearing great reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I really wanted to love this place. It was just one bad visit that did it.

I've worked in enough restaurants to understand that sometimes, service just breaks down. It happens. What places have to remember is something called service recovery. Acknowledge to the customer what happened, apologize for the inconvenience, and somehow make it worth their while to come back.

I called in a take-out order. He quoted me 30-35 minutes. A little longer than the usual wait, but no problem. I showed up 40 minutes later to see my pizza order just going into the oven! So I waited...and waited...and waited. There was no explanation, no acknowledgment that it'll be a moment, just asked me what my order was. Meanwhile, I saw one guy trying to ask a fellow employee to assist topping pizzas, which she attempted, but moved oh so slowly. Customers who were eating there and done were standing around and waiting for their checks. Another man came in to pick up after me and wasn't even greeted. When my pizza was finally boxed and I went up to pay, the man didn't say one word about the chaos. No \"Sorry about the wait.\" Not one word about how long I waited for my call-in order. 

Will I return? Maybe. There's still a bad taste in my mouth, though. 

3 stars is more than I want to give, but I do recall the good visits. Hopefully, it'll be better in the future."}
{"text":"Soo good! If you're a Touro student ask about their $10 large pizza! It's the perfect meal after being at school all day. I recommend meatball as the topping. I also recommend the garlic knots! 

The service here is quicker than most pizza places and the quality is great. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. And great price. Will definitely be going back. The crust was very soft yet crunchy. And we asked for extra sauce and actually got it. And it was ready exactly when he said it would be."}
{"text":"I was planning on going to JACK N THE BOX on my 30 min. lunch break and I saw a PIZZA sign when i was turning into the parking lot so I drove to the back and saw BISTRO Pizza sign. I wanted pizza since it was FRIDAY. I am glad I went in there ! The gentleman taking my order told me about the lunch special and I ordered a small pizza[NOT VERY SMALL AT ALL] and a soda for $6.99- CHEAP- Two topping too! It came out in like ten minutes and it was so CHEESEY AND BOMB!! Awesome customer service and fast, and DELICIOUS ! Everyone at work was like,\" Where did you go!?\" they all agreed it was BOMB!  I will return this time to dine it with my kids!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great prices and great service 
There weekly specials are awesome and more than worth trying the Thadius"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, garlic knots, garlic fries and more than likely anything else you order! I am so jazzed to find the place in Henderson!! Go Bistro!!

Chicken Parmesan sliders, yes! I may be partial, but good grief they are outstanding!! Omg good!

Just love this place! Come here all the time, Judy forgot to post!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Tuscan Chicken. Huge portion, very tasty. Spouse had a fresh and healthy Bistro Salad Deluxe. Yum. Fast and good. They were very busy on a Friday night, but we got in and out quite fast. Returned Sunday for a large 3 item pizza. Ordered from home and was ready just when we arrived. Excellent pizza."}
{"text":"Very delicious  pizza. ..free garlic knots with yelp check it which are very yummy.... I would have to say somewhat poor customer service.... one night I went in and they had forgotten to put a new order of bread in the oven and I'm guessing the manager  was yelling...and I mean yelling at the employees right there in the open kitchen for all to hear. Was rather uncomfortable since I knew it was for my order. Never got an apology from the guy or anything"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Not satisfied. Not happy. Won't be coming back and will not be recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Called in an order. Was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. Got there and told them my name and they said it would be another 25 minutes and that they hadn't even started it yet. There are too many pizza places to out up with that kind of service. Maybe if he was nice about it...  He was rude."}
{"text":"Garlic knots are a MUST TRY! Fast delivery too.  We had the meatball pizza which was very yummy."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but the pizza was pretty greasy. It tasted good but all the toppings were sliding off. Garlic knots were good and the price was great for how much food you get."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Their pizza is great, and most importantly has a fantastic crust (which we all know, if the most important part of a pizza). The thing that takes this pizza place to the next level is the Poutine they weirdly have on their menu. Two of my favorite things in one place, pizza with good crust and french fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds. 

It's just an added bonus that they are a locally owned business."}
{"text":"Tried them out because of the excellent reviews.We were pretty disappointed.
I called in an order for pickup and was told it would be an hour and ten minutes. OK fine. They are busy.  The young man taking the order was not very friendly and I had to repeat the pizza toppings several times to him. I then inquired about the a special they have on their website. There was just dead air like he had no idea what I was talking about. 
I arrived about ten minutes earlier than the time they gave me. We expected to wait a few minutes , but we were told they already gave away our order. Huh??????????
We then waited about 35 minutes for them to remake the order. Some sort of small gesture of an apology would have been nice.
Was this pizza worthy of an hour and thirty five minute wait??? No. It was ok. 
Would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with an owner and staff that strive to take care of their customers. When I visit my family I always make sure to get a pie from here, it never disappoints! The garlic knot meat ball sliders are awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the entire Las Vegas area.  Pizzas are fantastic but so is everything else on the menu.  The staff is always friendly too.  Can't go wrong eating at Bistro pizza!"}
{"text":"Visiting around the area and decided to go  Bistro Pizza yesterday and the food was amazing. My family and I got salads  which had one of the best tasting tomatoes I've ever had( juiciest). Also their pizza dough was so great(not to thick not to flimsey). 
      
       The employees were super friendly. The place had a cozy/family feeling to it. Definitely going to come back when I visit again."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza was awesome. Everyone LOVED their food, including my 66-year-old dad and my 10-year-old nephew. The chef was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The meatball and garlic pizza here is delicious! The only other place besides Metro Pizza that I enjoy the meatballs from. 

What makes their pizza more desirable than some of the bigger, good quality chains are their reasonable prices."}
{"text":"3.5-4 Stars. I agree with many reviewers, this is some of the better pizza I've had in Henderson from a more traditional pizzeria. The ingredients are high quality and with a simple, straightforward menu, the product really shines. Placing a phone order on a Sunday during peak time was a 45 min wait. 

We had a medium pepperoni pizza with an order of garlic knots- the best part for me! They were so fluffy and flavorful, even better dipped in the perfect marinara. Pizza was good, but cut incredibly lazily by the same person working the counter, leaving no two slices the same, two being about 3 inches long- not cool and not up to health code standards. 

I would definitely be interested in trying some of their pastas or entree meals next time and would imagine we will be back for pizza takeout in the future, but probably not with any great haste."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Las Vegas! Yes, I said it.. BEST! Better than Grimaldis! Its a small, locally owned mom and pop shop with excellent pizza. Been there 4 times and never disappointed. Try the Garlic Knots! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Super helpful and let us order 4 pizzas and had them ready for pickup for us for our sons birthday party.    Good food."}
{"text":"From the first phone call, to the delivery, to the taste of the pizza, everything was exceptional. The man we spoke to on the phone was incredibly helpful and friendly. We ordered for our daughter's birthday and we couldn't be happier with everything. Pizza was delicious and this will be our new go to spot."}
{"text":"The pizza was soggy and the salads had no flavor. We got garlic knots and they didn't come with marinara sauce so they were dry and unappetizing. The cook working inside was very nice and the restaurant appeared to be clean when I went in to pick up my order. I just wish the food was as good as the service!"}
{"text":"Husband loves their spicy fries!  Food is good; even bought the spice in a jar; going back for more!  Loved their garlic knots too!"}
{"text":"What can I say.......hmmmmm...everything is great here! The one or two workers & the food. ordering is easy whether it's for dine in or take out, the order is always perfect and delicious. Looking for a new pizza place to try? The yelp reviews says.............You should try it! Really you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love pizza!  It's one thing I could never give up.  I don't know how I can convince you to give this place a try but you really should.  It truly is the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas area.  The staff and owner are also worth coming to give this pizza a try.  They always make you feel appreciated and welcomed!  They also have a coupon in the new entertainment book so gives you another reason to get your butts to Bistro Pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked the pizza . Didn't love it though . It was extremely hot in fact took like 20 minutes just to get one bite in . Also the place is extremely hot for dine in ! Turn on the AC!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Garlic knots taste excellent, crispy on the outside yet soft and fluffy in the middle. Chicken fingers are big and moist with a ton of flavor. Pizza is great!! We ordered two, one with pineapple and ham, the other with pepperoni, sausage, meatball and extra cheese. Crust is light and crispy, and the meatballs are amazing!! 

The service we received was great, food was delivered to our table quickly and everyone was so friendly. While we were eating, the soda machine ran out of syrup in the one I was drinking, I was quickly given an ice cold can of soda so that I would not go without a beverage while eating, that to me is attention to detail and means a lot. 

Bistro Pizza has a loyal customer in us from here on."}
{"text":"Tyler was kind enough to let us have my daughter's 3rd birthday at his restaurant. He went out of his way to make sure the kids had a great experience. The food was amazing as usual, and the service was more than exceptional. Thank you Tyler and your staff for helping  make memories for our family."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be no big deal by the looks of it from the outside but boy was I wrong. You basically get to build your own pizza and get your favorite things on it which was awesome. We also got wings which were okay. The garlic knotts we ordered were so delicious and definitely a great appetizer choice. Service is okay its not a fancy place so you basically order up front then they bring the food to your table. Had a pleasant experience over all because the pizza was the best Ive had in a while!"}
{"text":"Love the food  and staff here. Definitely a must if your in the area.  Or even worth the drive.  
Great flavors and very fresh to boot"}
{"text":"really good pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza and garlic knots are great. The wings are also very tasty. Actually, I haven't tried anything here that I don't like. If you go here, you won't be disappointed by food quality or price. Its a nice hidden little gem."}
{"text":"Went here for pi day (3.14) and were very surprised that this gem was hiding right around the corner from us. The staff is very friendly and helpful, reguardless of their computer systems being offline they still took our order for pickup.

We ordered 1 large pizza, hot wings, bistro fries and garlic knots. Everything was very delicious and prepared with care. My only issue was with the size of the wings, they had almost no meat on them. 

I would recommend coming here forsure. They do not offer delivery so you have to make a trip over there, which is well worth it. This will be my new go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Nothing to rave about. Staff wasn't very friendly and I felt rushed. Ate inside and the staff that were making pizzas were loud and singing and talking about random guy stuff. Was hard to have a conversation with my wife while hearing the staff sing obnoxious songs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best pizza in Henderson! Every time we order we are sure to get their huge garlic knots along with our pizza because they're so good!

It's really busy there, which is to be expected because the pizzas are delicious, so just be aware of that when you call. Sometimes they can't hear you over the noise!"}
{"text":"Third time eating here and I've never been disappointed.  I've tried the garlic knots, pizza and stromboli, and I'd recommend them all!  My goal is to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas. No chains. A local shop with fresh ingredients, gluten free crust, and fantastic flavor. There's a great selection of toppings and a some fantastic other-than-pizza menu items."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! They have a great deal on Sunday's for a $10 large. The garlic knots were also delicious."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go here since it was super close and we were starving. They didn't really greet us or tell us how the ordering system worked, but we figured it out. They were nice enough..It seemed like a really chill family like place.

The menu isn't big, but that's always a good sign when it comes to Italian food. Smaller menu, usually means better quality.

We got to bottled snapped drinks from their fridge section. Then ordered a small ham, pinapple and bacon pizza, an order of the chicken parm sliders, with the cheesy herb fries. 

We asked about the free garlic knots with the yelp check in. The owner (I'm guessing?) Told us it's only when you get a large one topping or more pizza. We said cool, no problem. (We're bad at reading fine print lol.) But this really cool kid making the pizzas in the back came out and gave us two garlic knots anyway. He was awesome. 

The manager or owner delivered the pizza to out table super quick. Everyrhing was super hot and fresh tasting. The pizza was delicious. Huge peices of ham and the crust was perfect. The sliders were so good. I think they needed more sauce, but that's just my personal preference. The fries were super garlicky (sp?) And flavorful.
 
All in all, this place was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Never disappoints. The people here are always friendly and the pizza is the bomb!!! Oh the garlic knots are to die for. Oh and basically everything on the menu is ahhhmmmmaaazzzzziiiinnnnggggg. Favorite pizza place ever!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All the food i have had is amazing. Everything is served fresh and hot!! The employees are friendly too!"}
{"text":"2nd time ordering here and their pizza is good. Thick edge crust, but the middle is somewhat thin to me. I'm used to the crust being the same size as the middle of the pizza, but whatever! The toppings are fresh, and their sauce is unique. I don't like a ton of sauce on my pizza and they do it perfectly. Now, their wings...gosh I'm such a wing snob being from Buffalo. I had a craving for wings. Ordered them well done, crispy. I got breaded and soggy :*(   I miss wings from back home that are cooked perfectly, NAKED (no breading) and crispy! Everyone here thinks crispy wings are overcooked for some reason. I have to assume they've only been eating wings from chain pizza places all their lives and that's what they're used to?  IE: Pizza Hut, Papa Johns?   I want naked wings, crispy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside, and saucy...wings are meant to be messy...like 4 napkin messy. Sigghhhh the search continues. 

I'll still come back for their pizza though....oh and garlic knots are killer!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and friendly service. We played scrabble during the short wait for our food."}
{"text":"Simply put, it's good pizza. Our 2-year old loved it, we all did. I found myself telling my husband, \"I'll be craving this\". Good thing we live up the street. Definitely a must-try."}
{"text":"Don't let the half-empty strip mall location be a deterrent. We decided to try Bistro Pizza after the rave reviews from Shirley B. on facebook and yelp. And wow, are we glad we did!

The Garlic Knots are a must-have. At $5 for 6 knots, it's a steal. My young sons would have been happy to have made a meal out of just those. But thankfully they saved room for pizza. As my 9-year-old declared, \"Mom this is MUCH better pizza than (insert another local pizza joint we often frequent which has MUCH higher prices)!\"

The owner was friendly, gracious and welcoming. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was they currently don't serve alcohol and I enjoy a frosty libation with my pizza! But we will be back again and often!"}
{"text":"This pizza we ordered was one of the better in the area that offers delivery. Most NY style around here is incredibly greasy. The best part was the dough and crust. Exactly how I like it. The rest however was mediocre at best. Very little sauce if any, had no flavor at all. The cheese was good quality but the toppings were very bland. I would recommend but don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Still going strong after all this time, Bistro is still pumping out quality food."}
{"text":"Ok so I was told metro pizza is the best in Las Vegas ! So I went last week ordered the the same BBQ pizza I ordered at bistro pizza the week before yes Metro makes a very good pizza but Bistro pizza is the best I have had since new york and yes new york is the bench mark for all pizza this place is great from the food to the people great eating... ."}
{"text":"OK Yelpers-- I trusted you on this one and you were right! I feel funny giving this place 5 stars without actually trying the pizza -- but the Stromboli was freakin' great. I tried the all meat Stromboli (pepperoni, ham, and sausage). The owner (Tyler) let me know that marinara sauce was actually baked in the Stromboli and recommended it over the calzone for that reason. The dough was so good that I didn't even need to use the  extra side of wonderful marinara sauce that came with it. 

TIP---- Save your receipt because you can get 1/2 off your next pizza purchase up to four days after your initial visit. With food this good, I might not be able to wait 4 hours before I come back. 

I am so happy Tyler has decided to open his own restaurant- he has a good product. I can't wait to try the pizza and wings next time......

*****UPDATE ***** I came back within 4 days and tried the pizza. I wanted to love the
pizza, but left disappointed. The pizza is ordinary, and I had to adjust my rating 
accordingly."}
{"text":"Bistro Pizza is definitely a gem! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for an amazing pizza joint. It's casual and a great place for family, lunch, or a relaxing dinner. 

1. Location: This pizza joint is tuck away in a little strip mall off the 215 and Gibson. Very easy to find and easy to get to.

2. Service: It's a one man operation, just the owner. He takes your order and cooks it up right in front of you. He also serves and rings you up too. Great guy!

3. Food: Food quality is great! I ordered the spin zone calzone which was amazing. It was sauteed with fresh spinach and garlic, ricotta and mozzarella. When it arrived it was HUGE, fresh, and delicious. The homemade marinara sauce, YUM! I loved the fresh chopped garlic.  My boys ordered garlic knots, which was made fresh and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza sauce is simple perfection. 

4. Nice touch: I also like the paper table cloth. He has crayons on the tables so you can draw while you wait. It helps to pass time especially with kids. The owner also picks drawings and hangs them up on his counter. Nice little touch.

*tip: if you check-in with yelp you get a discount on a one topping large.

It's a GREAT neighborhood pizza joint. You'll be thankful you found this place. I give him a 5 out of 5 stars. Excellent! This place came highly recommended to me and everyone I've recommended absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Stopped by on the way to my sons football game for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised! I am very picky about pizza, but I loved it! The garlic knots are delish and the marinara, even better! They have a great lunch special for a personal (6 small slices) pizza and drink for $6.99. I would highly recommend them! Hope they open more around town. :)"}
{"text":"Very good food, very good service.  Calzone and garlic knots were awesome.  Friendly small place with big flavors."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for an unexpected family emergency. We looked around for some much needed comfort food and came across this place, so we tried it since we are both pizza lovers. 

Best. Decision. Ever. We were so use to the Americanized Dominos pizza that we had forgotten what an authentic pie tasted like. Highly recommend this place. 

They carry the legendary ghost pepper but we didn't want to try it since figured that if it burned as much as they say going in, we can't expect any better when it's on it's way out  

You won't regret this place."}
{"text":"So after a disappointing first attempt, Tyler made good on his promise to take care of us.  Instead of opting for delivery, I made the drive to go pick it up myself.  The result was a hot and fresh, delicious pizza accompanied by chicken parmesan with noodles that weren't overly cooked.  The pizza came out soft and fluffy with a bit of chewiness. Instead of overloading it with toppings we chose to keep it simple with a half cheese half mushroom (Absolutely delicious mushrooms btw), which allowed the sauce to shine through (It's a very good sauce and it was too bad we could barely taste it the first time).  The garlic knots were cooked very well this time without too much butter.  

Overall we enjoyed the meal very much and would definitely come back again.  Thanks again, Tyler.

It's probably recommended to not order delivery and invest the effort to go get it yourself."}
{"text":"As soon as you step foot into Bistro, you get that fresh baked Italian bread smell. Even if you weren't hungry, you will be after that aroma. 
It's a pizza joint, I will make this review short, simple, and to the point. 
Positives:
-Family owned and operated. They use homemade recipes and fresh ingredients. My belly thanks you for that. 
-East coast style pizza. There are about 4 places in Vegas that have true Jersey pizza, this is one. 
-Great service. They take care of their regulars. We are grateful.
-RANCH!! Like the best ever! 

Negatives:
-The delivery is only SOMEtimes, and when they're busy, you are looking at an hour wait, MINIMUM! Step up your game, and have a driver on call 24-7. 
-The ghost pepper fries. I am a fan of spicy, but don't tease me with ghost peppers if it is only a dry season blend of semi spicy flavor. FAIL. 
-The wings are just ok. The sauce on them is great, but if you want chicken, stick with the fingers over wings. 

I personally love their location, but I think if they were to open a second location in a more central area, they may get more than the Henderson local love. However, this is a SOLID choice for a slice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas ! This place is a gem, must go and try ... everything on the menu is top notch ! Excellent staff and there super friendly , shout out to Emily this girl needs a raise she's always on it and very good to customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The owner use to work for metro so you know he can make a good pizza. I'm a NJ former resident so I know my pizza and I recommend trying there's."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on here before but have used Yelp several times for great recommendations. So here goes. Me and a few friends needed to cure some Sunday morning hangovers before we went out drinking again for Superbowl Sunday. We were visiting Las Vegas from AZ so we didn't know the area well at all. My friend stumbled upon this little joint on Yelp and we were all craving some pizza. We decided to come check it out. We ordered a 16' half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken pizza. My friend is from NY and LOVES buffalo chicken pizza. He says it's impossible to find good buffalo chicken pizza in our hometown of Phoenix, AZ. Well we found it here. Not only was the pepperoni half great, but the other half of our pizza was so good that my friend from NY wanted to personally tell Tyler how good it was. Outside of his home state, he said it was the best buffalo chicken pizza he has ever had anywhere on the west coast. We also ordered some garlic knots which were very tasty. Tyler was super friendly and came and talked to us about his restaurant and how he got started. We enjoyed every minute of our experience at his restaurant. Keep up the great work, Tyler! We will DEFINITELY be coming by again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Ok . . . .went here for my 1st time not knowing what to expect and I must say I was impressed!  Very good Large Pizza, Salad, Wings and Garlic Knots.  Very good food at a very good price.  We will definitely be back on a very regular basis.  I would say this is the 2nd best pizza place we have found in the Vegas area.  However, we got everything above for only $30 . . . .. .and you can't even get the pizza only for $30 that we like at the \"other\" place.  You have sold us; we are a fan!!!"}
{"text":"so delicious!! The pizza is great reminds me of the east coast! Best garlic knots I've ever had! A little pricey but you get a lot so it's a great value. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A rare gem in Henderson. I pass this plaza all the time , thought it was mostly abandoned. Gave it a try based on all the buzz generated on yelp. Ordered the BBQ chicken cal zone, which was AMAZING. Made with just the right amount of cheese & toppings , dough was baked just right & not burnt. Cal zone was nice & crispy and not leaking grease like so many other pizza places in Henderson. Definitely enjoyed my first time there & gonna grab some garlic knots next time. Place was very clean, staff was very friendly & helpful. GO GIVE IT A TRY!"}
{"text":"Wow.. we discovered a great place today. Their Pizzas are amazing... made from scratch. Loved the crust and the flavor. We ordered Tuscan Chicken as well. It comes with garlic knots and house salad with their secret house dressing . Their staff is very friendly and I am sure to come back again for their food and service."}
{"text":"The service was good (just ordered for pickup), but the pizza was really disappointing. And we are no picky pizza eaters. Dough didn't have any taste to it, and wasn't cooked evenly. Too greasy. Was not for us :(. Definitely overpriced for the product."}
{"text":"Once again, an amazing filling experience. My family loves this place. I love love love the Bistro fries and garlic knots. Stop by and enjoy the food. :)"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had combined with the best customer service at a pizza place I've had. You can't go wrong here. Even the wings are amazing! I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Great place and wil be definitely going back. So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentleman, boys and girls, children on all ages, gather around for a fantastic restaurant and PHENOMENAL staff. 

Customer Service- A++. From the moment we walked in we felt like we were family (and not the fighting kind). They helped us find the perfect things to order and service was great. Give these people an award (or raise) because I fell in love with this place even before I tried my food. 

Restaurant outlook- B overall it looks like a generic pizza shop. Nothing special. Black and red tables with paper on the table. Average scenery. 

Food- A. We ordered The Spin Zone calzone, Wet Fries, and Garlic knots."}
{"text":"The Chef is the owner, looks like a one man band.  He is friendly and personable.
The soda is a great! More syrupy than most.  The food was a GREAT value!  And is delicious!   Garlic cheese bread, was yummy but the marinara dipping sauce was exceptional!  My friend ordered Buffalo Chicken sliders and the bun was a garlic knot! Yummy!  And the pizza was great!  He even has garlic powder, which is a must w/ pizza.  
I will be returning."}
{"text":"After reading through some of the glowing reviews about this place I decided to try it for a carry out pizza and see what all the fuss was about. I ordered a simple medium sausage pizza and picked it up about 15 minutes later, hot out of the oven. IT. WAS. AMAZING. Even better, if you decide you want to eat there again within 3 days and provide your receipt they'll give you half off the next time around. From now on if I have a hankering for pizza around Henderson, Bistro will be my first call !"}
{"text":"We had the joy of trying this pizza at my sons birthday party and it was delish! Living in Chicago for 19 years had spoiled me on great pizza. I only had the pepperoni pizza but the flavor was very good. It would say this place should get 4.5 stars because I cannot rate any place 5 stars after some of the deep dish pizzas I have eaten in Chitown. But, finally a place that sells yummy pizza, too bad they are far from my house because I would frequent them often!"}
{"text":"Loved it!

The service was great and relaxed, fun place to chill while waiting for your food.

Table clothes are paper and they provide crayons to color :) much fun!

They also have some common games like scrabble, boggle, and sorry - great way to pass the time while waiting for food.

The food itself was great as well - hit the spot for a pizza craving.

If you're in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"First timers here an wow the yelp reviews were right, everything was good! Ordered white pizza with garlic, it was cheesy, tasty, fresh. 
The hubby ordered teriyaki wings which I'm not a wing fan and these wings were good, fresh not frozen, tasty sauce. 
Checked in and got garlic knots for free. Haven't had one since New York years ago and wow these knots were good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was killing time out in Henderson waiting for the Fresno State/UNLV game to kick off, I found this place on Yelp and it was an excellent choice!

I had a customized calzone and it was one of the best calzones I have ever eaten. They make them fresh so you can put whatever you want in them. The cook was real proud of his creation when he brought mine out, too. I liked that attitude, very friendly and made me feel he enjoyed cooking there.

The booth I sat in even had an outlet so I charged my phone while I ate. 

I'm really glad I stopped by, if I'm ever in the area again, I will hit it up."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great pizza, love the garlic knots, love the sauce, love the ghost fries, love that you can draw on the table. It's a great little place, you won't be disappointed. 

The only downside is the salad which I wasn't that fond of, they could do a better job there, but other than that, I dig it.

You're probably here wondering if you should go or not, well I'll settle it for you: GO!"}
{"text":"I hate to give an up and coming place like this one a bad review but today's meal was disappointing. They are widely known for their garlic knots and I have to agree with everyone ... the garlic knots were delicious. However, everything else was below average. The pizza dough was gummy and felt undercooked. The toppings were good but my wife found a weird hard cartilage or bone in her slice that grossed her out. I was excited for the meatballs and I was unimpressed with the lack of flavor. Finally, I ordered a small gluten free cheese less pizza and when I got home I notice it had cheese :-( Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance deceive you. The food is absolutely amazing! The sauce is flavorful and the garlic knots are the best we have ever had. 

I have celiac disease, and the owner made a great effort to make sure there was no cross contamination.  Finally, a pizza place that I like and that my family also loves!"}
{"text":"It's good party people, it's really good. Met up with Jaime W for breakfast, yes breakfast, it was a bit of a drive for me, but well worth it. This place is located in an unassuming strip mall off the 215/Gibson. I had recently purchased a Restaurant.com voucher for $25 off a $37.50 order with intentions on trying a couple different menu items. 

We arrived at 11 am on a Sunday, the Yelp hours posted said they opened at that time, turns out they don't open until noon, but they were nice enough to let us in and serve us. We started out with the most delicious, crisp Coke I've ever had (better than McDonald's Coke) why is this so exciting? Because I love a good soda with my pizza. Onto the garlic knots, best I've had, so soft and chewy and the perfect amount of seasoning. We decided to try the cheese pizza and add pineapple and jalepenos and a white pizza with sausage/garlic/tomatoes. Both were perfect. The crust was out of this world crazy good, flaky and just enough crunch. I'm not a huge sausage fan, but it tasted like it was made in house. Fantastic. 

We had a huge amount of leftovers I took home, I re-heated it for dinner, and to my surprise, it was just a delicious the second time around (reheated in the oven of course, not the microwave) the crust still had a good crunch to it. They also have ranch which is a huge plus. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  We wanted a quick but sit-down dinner on a Sunday evening. All was clean and in good repair.  Service was quick and courteous. And the big \"A\" grade from the health department was reassuring too!  The food portions were so generous that we had them for leftovers the next day.  My wife had a 3-cheese and hamburger Stromboli.  I had the Chicken Angelo (mushrooms, artichokes in a white wine sauce). It normally comes with angel hair pasta but I subbed the whole wheat penne instead.  All the ingredients complimented each other...man it was good!  We spent about $20 and 35 minutes for a great meal.  Another local gem we'll certainly try again.  Can't waiy to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza is nice.   I've had better, but I wouldn't refuse to eat it again.   The anti pasto salad is very good.  The garlic rolls are good too."}
{"text":"Green pepper and mushroom pizza was given a five star rating by 5 out of 9 of us.  Else 4 for the others.  We ordered via phone and pizzas came out of oven upon arrival. Service was super friendly.  Plenty of cheese for a base. Crust is not east coast thin but slightly fuller than that.  Very fresh.  Sauce a tad light for our friends from VA. MN, PA and OH guests all very pleased.  Toppings generous."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is excellent. So happy to have found it! If you're in the mood for pizza and in the Henderson area this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"This review is for a pizza I ate way back in December. It was that good and quality I still remember it. Ricotta and pepperoni + garlic, pretty basic and came out perfect. Crispy crust, thin but not too thin and hand tossed dough that reminds me of some of the better pizza establishments from where I live. I want to thank the kind staff there and I would come back to Henderson to grab a pizza again here."}
{"text":"Wow it was not that good and they took forever .. 
Their stars are earned by their really nice service. 

The pizza was really really oily, thin, and burnt.
This place is almost self service. They only bring you the pizza. You get your drink, napkin, seat yourself, etc."}
{"text":"The workers here are so friendly and really happy. I really love the environment and the vibe inside the restaurant. The food smells really good and looks delicious! I can't wait to try my lasagna and the Tuscan chicken! I would recommend coming here for a lunch time with family and friends!"}
{"text":"Went there after reading reviews on Yelp. THE BEST pizza, wings and garlic knots in town !! (including Vegas).  We are foodies and eat out a LOT, and this place is by far the best.
Will come here again and again and again."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim .  saw it had good reviews so I gave it a shot with my friend from out of town . really good was shocked . other than being a bit pricey will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"If only this place was open later

Something about Bistro homemade sausage that makes me come back, maybe Tyler spices it with some crack, because it beyond addicting.

Perhaps Tyler mixes this dough with some of that magic dust, because the crust is still crispy after 30 minutes and taste even better after a few minutes in the oven the next morning.

One thing for sure, Bistro makes a killer pizza, and the owner will bend over backwards to make his customer happy, because on my last visit to Bistro I walked in 15 minutes after his posted closing, and he still made me a pizza.    

Is this one of the best pizzas in Henderson?   Well, look above on my rating, that should answer everything."}
{"text":"pizza is nothing special for the price. They are also \"Deal Nazis.\" They won't let you use your touro 1 topping large for 10$ and the yelp check in for free order of garlic knots and a weekly special (mon: 2 small 2 toppings for 10$) eventhough theyre completely seperate orders."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the stars.  Went to this place because everyone rated the pizza out of this world.  I am from Chicago and had thin crust to deep dish pizza.  Gave this place a chance since it was in my neighborhood and wow was I disappointed.  The pizza sauce was bland and honestly there was nothing rememberable or special about it.  Had the garlic knots that were greasy and not very flavorful.  I would rather go to Little Caesar's and get a pizza with more flavor and cheaper price.  I have tried this place twice and the outcome was the same."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Tyler is great, always gives consistent fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"This place is totally legit. Little hole in the wall and you can't really  see it from the street but it's a must stop. Everything is freshly made tried most everything on the menu with no disappointment. Prices are very good and very friendly staff. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Quick look: Pizza - 4 Stars /// Wings - 3 Stars 

In depth review: Saw the amazing reviews on Yelp and drove a good distance to try it. We ordered the pizza and wings special that is listed on the website. Gent who answered the phone was not too sure about the special and had to ask another co-worker about it. Our order was for take out and the pizza and wings were ready in 15 minutes as promised. Nice booths along the wall for people who want to dine in. 

We ordered a large mushroom and cheese pizza (extra crispy) and the wings Buffalo style (medium heat). Pizza looked and smelled great. It passed the old \"NY test\" and did not slump over and you could eat it with just one hand. Crust was delicious. Was not the best pizza we have had in Vegas but it was near the top. The mushrooms were plenty and they were certainly fresh. Solid pizza, we enjoyed it. 

The wings were mediocre and I was disappointed with the sauce and what they call \"blue cheese.\" Buffalo Wings are made to be paired with blue cheese dressing and for some reason restaurants on the west coast like to give you ranch dressing? The blue cheese dressing they gave me tasted like ranch and it was really watery. Passed on it and used my own in the fridge. I asked for extra wing sauce on the side and this was also very watery. Tasted OK but it was too wet and watery and did not coat the wing properly. Need to work on the sauce, you can do better. 

Great pizza but they should pay better attention to the ole chicken wing. It's not a side item and it derives the same amount of love you put in the pizza pies. 

But we will be back and give it another chance. Try some other items as the guy cooking assured me that everything was homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we were looking for good pizza. Being from the east coast we're very picky when it comes to pizza. Well this place was up to the challenge and served us some of the best tasting Stromboli we ever had. It was fresh, hot, and very flavorful. The garlic knots were also top notch! I wish they had this place in Orange County and we highly recommend."}
{"text":"I finally made it here and I'm so glad I did.  The pizza was great but the chicken parm sliders were fricken amazing.  They were chicken fingers with sauce and cheese placed in garlic knots.  Yup, garlic knots as the bun!  I can't stop thinking about those darn things.  The service was great and very friendly."}
{"text":"I love them so much I love the food .I love the service .food is always fresh . Keep up the great  work and keep feeding me ;)

Truly by a very happy customer  meme"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the crust was bland with no flavor. There's better pizza in town."}
{"text":"The chicken parm was alright. It's not Olive Garden good but it's fine. The garlic knots are pretty great though."}
{"text":"Tyler rang me up good customer service great recommendations and the 

The pizza was good

The meatballs tasty

The chicken parm tasty 

Knots where very good

Over all a tasty meal we'll be back!...."}
{"text":"Located just south of 215/Gibson. It's easy to get to but a terrible spot in a neighborhood strip center. Nice that it's near lil browns cupcakes.

Went in and its a small local pizza shop look. The place smelled good. We sat in front of the cooking area where we could see them cheffing it up.
The menu is simple and wasn't sure what to expect because the place looks less than unassuming.
We ordered a couple pizzas which were fantastic and the toppings looked hand cut. The pie and crust and sauce were cooked perfectly and tasted perfect and  tasted fantastic.
Garlic knots were huge, hot and you really could taste the garlic and light cheese topping with marinara. You gotta try them. We ended up taking some home as we ordered a bunch to try it out.
The calzone was gourmet style and they'll ale it anyway you want.
Salad was fresh topped as you'd get in a very nice restaurant and topped with a great balsamic dressing. Perfect.

They cook was more like a chef that bought a pizza place. The food quality and taste was  one of the best ever for a pizza experience. 

Price was very reasonable for what you get. The cook/chef turned out to be the owner and very personable and friendly. 

Highly recommended to give them a shot. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. The pizza is really good, I think its the best pizza I have had in Vegas so far. I tried the pizza with white sauce and meatballs, onions, green peppers and mushrooms. The flavor was just amazing. Definitely not soggy like some other places where I've had pizza before. The pizza base was also just perfect. Not too soft, not too hard/tough. I am definitely going here whenever I crave for pizza next!"}
{"text":"11/22/14- My husband wanted pizza tonight for dinner, reluctantly I agreed. I'm just not a pizza or hamburger person at all. 

We'll let me tell you this! This establishment has changed my mind about pizza. We live in Lake Las Vegas so anywhere we go it's a 20 to 40 minute drive. Bistro Pizza is well worth the drive.

We ordered a large pepperoni, mushroom and onion pizza for I believe $25.00, wet fries I believe were $4.95 and got the free garlic knots when we checked in with YELP.

This place is the ."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a couple times the past month, and im surprised it's pretty good food. It's a little hard to find this place. I usually go to metro cuz it's right down the street but the pizza wings and even salad is good here. They have a good house salad dressing. They have pasta, sandwiches, and some other things at decent prices. Give it a try and I'm sure you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Not quite 5-worthy but still some pretty solid pizza. Owner is very nice and takes a lot of pride in his work."}
{"text":"Good options! Different than most pizza places and it's. Relaxed environment. I will definitely come back here, I really liked it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, we also had the Sweet Chili flavored wings and they we not very flavorful, good but not great."}
{"text":"I brought my car to the tire place nearby and found myself needing to kill an hour with my 3 and 5 year old. We walked by and ordered pizza for family movie night. Continued on to other various locations on foot. When we came back, my girls were FASCINATED by the pizza making. So they watched while dough was tossed, sauce spread and cheese sprinkled. Since they were mesmerized, I just had a seat. Next thing I know, my kids both had a plate with dough and two cups of sauce and cheese!!!! They were SOOO excited! The nice guy behind the counter (we now call him celebrity chef) put them in the oven and everything! These guys went above and beyond on a FRIDAY afternoon. This place ROCKS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall the pizza is good. Garlic knots are huge and delicious, just wish they used real butter to toss them in, then they'd be perfect! Have ordered from here many times as it's right down the street from my house and they have good deals - usually get the 1 topping pizza + wings for $20. If you bring your receipt back within 3 days you get 50% off your pizza."}
{"text":"Always love the food! Order is hot and ready on time. Staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"much much better than last time! Very yummy I definitely recommend eating in rather than delivery or carry out. Oh and those ghost fries.. Uhh to die for!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say, best garlic knots ever!! Second a large 1 topping pizza for $10.00 if you mention web special. Fresh ingredients and delicious, the staff was friendly and helpful when asking questions about their product. We have found our new favorite pizza joint!"}
{"text":"You guys have to try this place!! I ordered something on the menu but modified and they did not disappoint. We were going to go to olive garden or macaroni grill, but glad those places were full. This is a must try, the pizza and bistro fries are delicious!!!! And the pasta is to rave about!!"}
{"text":"Found this tasty little joint thanks to our friends here on yelp! We were a little hesitate to give it a try but yelp hasn't let me down ever so we opted in.We were NOT disappointed! We received a free order of absolutely delicious garlic knots for checking in on yelp. The marinara sauce was unreal, so good! The Caesar salad was solid and fresh. We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it was excellent. The staff was courteous and very helpful.  The cashier/manager? was a sweetheart. She was helpful, honest and professional. Price was surprisingly inexpensive! We are hooked! Nice work Bistro Pizza!"}
{"text":"Really some honest to goodness pizza!
Genuine classic pizza flavors and the sauce is just perfect.
The crust is labeled as thin, but there is plenty of it and it is like no other in Las Vegas.
This is proper pizza and made in such a way that I didn't realize that this is what pizza should taste like.
The only flaw would be the business hours and the days they are open.
Seems they are open like every other day and last Saturday I drive by and notice they are totally closed and dark at 8:30PM. 
That is really odd, but I guess you need to catch them when you can, but it is worth it.
Will have to try their other foods too."}
{"text":"good ass food!!! Great 3 day deal they got if u come back with the receipt from before and you get half off ur next order. It's dope! Dig it!"}
{"text":"So far so good ordered a gluten free for my son and I to eat. We split it was absolutely great. The crust is perfect. A little oily, may be the type of cheese used. Ordering a large to go for my little brothers with free garlic knots. Il give you in up date in a few on how that was. Pretty sure it will be great!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and pizza bistro is a hidden gem. You even get a fresh decent size salad. I had the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti and my wife had the chicken Angelo. Both were perfect and only $10 per dinner. You get six garlic knots with your Yelp check-in. I can't wait to try their pizza. It's just a hole in the wall restaurant in a strip mall but the cooks are pros. They really know their stuff. This will be my first choice from now on when it comes to Italian food. Returned since was so good last time and lasagna was rubbery and is supposed to be their signature dish. Salad was just OK. Chicken Angelo wasn't good either. Garlic knots not cooked enough and doughy."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Crispy and tasty crust. Large meaty chunks of mushrooms. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is a real diamond in the rough. Tucked in a small plaza in between a Kumon and a salon, this out of the way pizzeria is sure to attract some attention with its New York style pizza, especially with how they have deals for every day of the week.

When trying to judge a pie, you have to go back to the basics and as such, when you're judging a New York slice, you have to go for a plain cheese. But simplicity does not mean lackluster. The dough was thin and crispy with just enough charred bubbles to really compliment the tomato sauce. And surprisingly, while there was a generous slather of cheese on top,it didn't grease through the box as many other pizzas do.

Along with the cheese pizza, we also decided to try a stuffed meat and bell pepper pizza with mushrooms. And while the cheese pizza is king, this one did not disappoint. The extra layer of cheese and the golden brown crust made the consistency a little fluffier, perfect for those who want something more akin to a Chicago slice. But the real star was their housemade marinara that was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was great. Yummy pizza, spaghetti had really good meatballs and the gravy fries were bomb! Everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"I wanted some bad carbs so we decided to try out Bistro pizza based on the high ratings.

When we arrived, the shop was kinda stuffy.  We placed an order of garlic knots and an order of hot wings to go.  While we were waiting for our order, we sat in a table close to the front, enjoying a short game of scrabble.  I liked the fact that the table cover was made of white paper, so that we can jot down our score.  While we were engaged in the game, a cricket caught my attention.  He was making his way across the floor.  EEK.  Good thing we are not eating there.

Our order was done and we quickly got home in 5 mins.  Unfortunately, the garlic knots did not taste as buttery and garlicky as I had wanted them to, and the hot wings were lightly battered, which we liked, but not crispy as we have liked them to be as well.  

My conclusion is that I probably did not order what they are popular for?  Either way, I will try again and order a pizza next time.  But for now, it's a Meh.  Because I have eaten better garlic knots and wings."}
{"text":"The service was very good! The pizza and wings were both a little under done...could have cooked for an extra 5 minutes or so.
Lots of cheese and the pizza was pretty tasty.
I would go again."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good prices.  What else can be said?

Tried the Pizza, Stromboli, garlic Knots.  All great!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say I came because it had high recommendations 4 1/2 Stars. I have no idea how they got that many. Friendly staff , the place looks shabby we ordered food that tasted and looked disgusting guaranteed frozen then cooked pizza's cheese had a funny taste to it I did enjoy the salad and the bistro fries and the coke lol. The garlic knots are good but extremely oily I had the chicken Parmesan it was bland my Freind had the chicken Angelo also very bland and looked like it fell off a truck and ran over a few times. I won't be coming back again and won't recommended to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Henderson! We drive out of our way to pick up Bistro Pizza when we are wishing for pizza. We have only had the pizza and garlic knots, so I can't comment of the other food. But we do love what we order! The service is great and employees are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We haven't dined here in a long time, and we remembered our great first visit. Sadly on this visit, we probably won't even be thinking of coming back.

Tyler wasn't there...not a good sign

younger kitchen staff...not really operating like a kitchen staff...need I say more?

We ordered the same thing as last time-Half White with mushrooms and basil, and half Salami, pepperoni, and pineapple. The lady taking our order rings us up, and while waiting, the kitchen is open to everything going on...EVERYTHING

Same lady with another worker picks up the rubber mats that they all step on, brings it towards the back, comes back and rings up a gentleman's to-go order, and then washes her hands-not long enough by health standards...then proceeds to make our pie...no bueno

The pizza dough was less crisp this time, and not as thin and flavorful as when Tyler made it.
we didn't finish our pie...

Seeing all the raves about the Garlic Knots, we take advantage of the yelp check-in for a free order, and what a waste, because after the first bite, I was done. Why? because the \"buttery\"
flavor isn't butter, it's Whirl (remember, this is an open kitchen)...a cheaper, longer lasting, nasty butter alternative that is just as bad, if not worse than margarine, Country Crock, etc. There's no better substitute for real  butter!
Now do you wanna use your Yelp Check in offer????  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"This is a great local pizza spot. I called in my order and the manager/owner helped me out and asked the right questions to get my order right. The order was fresh out of the oven hot and ready to go when I walked in the door and the staff is very pleasant.  

I got the garlic knots and a large pizza with my favorite topping of tomato slices.  The garlic knots are very chewy and include a hint of garlic and Parmesan.  The pizza crust is slightly thicker than a thin crust and not overly doughy and the toppings were fresh, for this almost-gourmet pizza.  The people here are number one in customer service in Henderson and greater Las Vegas for pizza."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with family on Monday afternoon. I had the Tuscan Chicken.  OMG it was so delicious!  And they have freshly baked garlic knots (bread) they are hot, fresh, and delicious! Chef/ Owner Tyler always creates \"Top Notch\" Italian food! I always eat here when I am in town visiting family. Great Italian food, large portions, fair prices.

Clean dinning room, clean restrooms, friendly service.

Family friendly, eat in or take it to go, either way you are in for a treat! 

Keep up the good work Chef Tyler!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Salad dressing, awesome pizza, awesome garlic knots, awesome place!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. I ordered a bunch of stuff to get a feel for it and see what the family thought. 

The garlic knots were good, but you really can't screw those up. 

We had a meatball pizza. It was ok at best, way overpriced- sauce tastes like jar sauce. 

The meatball Sandwich was ok, fries we're good. Too many herbs in the sauce. I think they're the precooked ones from costco. They tasted better on the pizza.

The chicken parmigiana was horrible. It wasn't breaded and all I could taste was herbs. I actually spit it out, kids did the same. 

Lastly, we had a cheese calzone. It seriously looked fantastic until we cut it open. It was a slab of melted cheese.  It was tasty, but so odd.

I grew up in NY and am very spoiled by great pizza. I'm picky, but my kids like any pizza place & asked that we not go back there Ever again.  

Worst $45 ever spent. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food no matter what you get! Excellent customer service as well. The person working the register was helpful, playful, polite, and made our first time at the restaurant a great experience. I will definitely stop there whenever I pass through the Vegas/Henderson area again! 

The pizza is thin crust, but I wouldn't expect it to be ultra-thin. The wings were crispy and not slimy like other places, and they tasted excellent! The cheese bread was very tasty and the marinara that came with it was just as great. You have to try the ghost pepper fries too! They are sweet at first, and go well with ranch to cool down the heat from the ghost pepper seasoning on the fries. 

Overall, I will come back to Bistro Pizza and I will instantly recommend it to anybody looking for food in the area."}
{"text":"Wish I wasn't allergic to garlic. I SO wish I could have tasted the famous garlic knots.

I don't know how we ended up in Henderson, but all I know is that the pizza was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we have gotten a pizza from Bistro Pizza. 
The employees were very nice and took my order on the phone. Pizza was ready on time. It had plenty of toppings and tasted great.
Will definitely buy from them again."}
{"text":"We had garlic knots, wings, and a large pizza. Everything was delicious! The garlic knots were hot, baked to perfection, and just the right amount of garlic! The wings were also done to perfection with a savory sauce! The pizza--tasty sauce, fresh toppings, and great crust! They are not shy with the toppings either!!! A great experience that didn't cost a small fortune. Perfect for the family!"}
{"text":"Finally! Daughter's dance studio is next door, so we've been smelling this place for sometime. Have heard rave reviews about all their food, but our experience is limited to kids plus me and a small pizza. Half cheese,  half tomato and spinach, all good! Daughter even had a slice of the spinach and tomato.  Slices of Roma tomato and what looked to be fresh spinach. I mention fresh spinach because I've ordered spinach on my pizza at other Vegas locations and it was gloppy, like frozen yuck. This was perfect! Can't wait to return and bring husband. Looked like some tasty calzone combinations available and will need to try the meatballs and garlic knots."}
{"text":"Meatballs look and taste like Fancy Feast cat food....Seriously they are NOT home-made. Marinara sauce straight from the can with no additions, tasted like watery flavorless acidy tomatoes. Pizza was undercooked and had to request them to cook it for another 20 minutes. Who wants droopy pizza that cannot stand up by itself....really? The baked rigatoni was the star of the show earning 3 stars out of 5 for being the least messed up, and having some good flavors. Will not be returning here again, unless I hear things have changed for the better. You could tell that there were no owners or mangers present. It was a millennial duo cook-off - the only thing missing was the microwave and the frozen burritos. Sorry guys you are going to have to try WAY harder than this; as the only one's that you are fooling are the one's with $8 bucks left in their pockets for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I usually get the pizza and meatball sub. Have never had a bad experience here. The staff is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Best pizza dough in town. The meatball sliders are really good and full of flavor. I love this place.  The calzones are also wonderful.  I have tried garlic knots (yummy) and fries.  Everything I've had a this place is just so tasty.  The owner Tyler really takes pride in the quality of the ingredients and in the preparation of the food.  The buffalo wings are fantastic as well.  This is my go to place for pizza, wings, lunch, dinner and anytime snacks.  I have taken food to go and also eat-in and always a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Very generous with their toppings and Excellent customer service! These guys are very proud of the food they serve as well they should be.  The marinated tomatoes in the salad are to die for, i wish i could just order a huge bowl of just the tomatoes. It's also a great place to bring our 2 year old, they have crayons for kids to draw on the tables."}
{"text":"Really the best pizza I've had in Henderson! I loved it and went for one of my cheat meals'. Since I'm not used to eating fried food and grease, I got sick, but only because I overdid it. Had 2 slices of pizza, 2 wings, and 2 garlic knots. Next time I'll have 1 slice of pizza, 1 wing, and 1 garlic knot. My daughter had barbecue chicken wings and absolutely loved them! The service is great, the food is bomb, and the employees are warm, welcoming, and pretty darn funny. The guy at the register made a few jokes, which made the experience even more better, especially since it had been kind of a rough day. 2 thumbs up. My fiancé, my daughter, and I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Saw great reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try and was not disappointed. The pizza was great and the garlic knots were awesome. The hot wings were not overly drenched in sauce like other pizza joints. Ill definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Slow ordering. Recommend take out. But the food and service made up for it. When I ordered garlic knots they said they were all out. After my meal they apologized with a big fresh order of knots. This kindness isnt found everywhere. Classy move Bistro Pizza"}
{"text":"I left my first review of Bistro Pizza on 3/6/13. I was very impressed with the pizza. Since then, I have visited many times, always leaving with a quality, well made, well cooked pie. 
I was in the area today, and had read several reviews extolling the virtues of the Bistro Buffalo Chicken Wings. I ordered a LG Pie and 8 Wings Medium. Having spent 25 years in Upstate NY, I consider myself an expert on what Buffalo Wings should taste like, and what the texture should be. Spent many afternoons at the Anchor Bar, and other dives along the NYS Thruway serving amazing Wings. If you call your Wings Buffalo Wings, you have to do them right. I'll put two columns below when rating Bistros Buffalo Wings, the general flavor, and how Buffalo Wings should taste. I've eaten some great Chicken Wings that were not Buffalo Wings 

      Metric.               Chicken Wing.        Buffalo Wing.      Reason
 Chicken Quality.                 A-                        B+.             Could be meatier
 Sauce Quality.                    A.                         A-              Missing something
 Oil quality.                          A-                         A-        Looked older,tasted fine
 Sauce Heat (Med).             A.                         A.               Perfect on spicy side
 Cooked Correctly.              A.                         A.               Mid Brown Skin
 Wings Hot (not spicy).        A-                        A-               Not fresh from Oil
 Skin Crisp                           B.                        C.               Skin rubbery
 Overall Flavor.                     A-                        A-               Sauce not perfect

Overall Grade.                      A.                        B+

The only real complaint was the skin. As I walked in the door, I believe I saw Tyler move over to the fryer and dump the wings that were hanging over the hot oil from the fry basket into the sauce bowl. I winced as I assumed they were sitting over the oil losing their crisp skin. They couldn't have been there long, but long enough to not have the required crispy crunch when you bite into them. I did test two in the parking lot to be fair. Acceptable in Vegas, but a Hangin' offense in Upstate NY. The wings were still good, but next time ( and there will be a next time) I'll call when I'm 7 or so minutes away and add the Buffalo Wings to my Pizza order. 
The Bistro wings are definitely worth trying, some time I will eat on site and burn myself as they are right out of the oil. 
I will then revisit this post and adjust as necessary. 
Keep up the great work Tyler!"}
{"text":"Great little secret gem! Tyler's food is always excellent. I get the meatball sliders and bistro salad."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza super crispy!! We really enjoyed bistro pizza!! My daughter really loved getting to draw on the table with the paper and the excitement of getting her drawing put on the wall. Whenever we're on that side of town will definitely make a point to stop in to eat!"}
{"text":"First time trying Bistro Pizza.  We got the meatball and ricotta pizza, the bistro salad, and free garlic knots with our Yelp check in.  Everything was delicious.  The bistro salad had fantastic balsamic marinated tomatoes and red peppers, artichokes, and mozzarella.   The garlic knots are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very garlicky.  They come with a yummy marinara dipping sauce.  The main event, the pizza, was very good.  Crispy crust, good sauce, the meatballs were very delicious.   It was a little more expensive than I expected, but we will be coming here again.  Maybe to dine in since they have booths and board games."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the reviews. I have bounced around between pizzerias in town and was hoping to find one closer to where I live that I could count on. After moving to town from my native NYC you could say I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but not enough of a snob where I can't/won't admit a good find.

First thing I noticed is that they don't greet you. Maybe if they weren't busy and were waiting for an order they would, but they were moderately busy and there were multiple guys behind the counter. Each and every guy that was behind the counter looked at me at separate intervals, but not once did anybody say \"how you doing, just give us a second here.\" I don't need handholding, but  some sort of \"be right with you\" would have been cool.

Guy who took my order was quick and efficient. I ordered and I waited, decent sized order and wait time matched what I ordered, which was fine. They even had it done a bit quicker that I had anticipated. I was taking it to go.

Redeemed the Yelp offer for free garlic knots with a large pizza ordered, which they forgot to give me (the knots lol.) Luckily I said something while still there, and they gladly handled that on the spot. Better to have it happen there than discovering it once I got home.

Ok, now to the food: 

Lg. White Pizza with pepperoni & fresh garlic - very little grease (which is hard to do on a pizza with cheese and pepperoni, so kudos there.) Dough could have been more crisp, but I had read reviews about their crust and knew what to expect. Still really tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings. Nice guys!

Medium Wings - They were ok. I think they would have been better eaten in, not ordered to go. 

Bistro Fries - not bad, just not my cup of tea. Saw pictures on the site/yelp with what looked like stringy cheese. Yeah, there was none of that. One of the reviews raves about them, I wasn't that fond of them. Personal taste, they were fine...I just wouldn't order them again. 

Garlic Knots - tasty, crisp...loved 'em. 

Overall I really like this place! If you come back with your receipt you get half off a pizza within three days...nice touch! I think next time I visit I will order to eat in, I'm confident I will be even more pleased with an order fresh out of the oven. 

Thanks guys! Good stuff! I'll be back!

Tyler: Thanks for your reply, seems altogether a lost art these days. I wasn't blaming you guys for the travel ability of the food, I definitely got the feeling it was travel time induced lol. Still overall a good experience and it will most likely be one of many more.

Thanks again! I appreciate you guys!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great local pizza place, check Bistro out. The garlic knots are awesome!  Their pizza is the best part, great sauce, lots of cheese and toppings. If you get a salad, you have to get the Bleu cheese dressing. Yummo!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Friendly staff and down to earth. The Garlic balls are awesome. The pizza crust is great as its cooked fully across the bottom not soggy in the middle like so many places in Vegas. Delicious. Also the mushrooms are terrific. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Although not much to look at, the pizza, pasta and salads we had were fabulous (including the gluten free pizza!). The staff was great. And those garlic knots . . . mmmmm."}
{"text":"Delish!!!! Will definitely return! Waked through the front door and the smell was amazing! Great food. Ordered the garlic knots: very tasty! Also ordered the Thaddius stromboli and a large pepperoni & sausage pizza; both were awesome! The team was hopping... phones were ringing and people were streaming through the doors...... I have discovered what others already did...... Great Food!"}
{"text":"We found Bistro because we lived across the street from it and decided to try something new. We've never been so lucky to come across such a good spot. This is by far one of top 5 pizza joints we've been too. Ever since coming here, we made it necessary to try more local pizza joints rather than chain pizza places. The service is always so great. I wish we remembered their names - but there is a big funny guy, a dude with dreads and a girl with a pixie hair cut who ALWAYS make our visit so special. We've been there at LEAST 10 times now and will continue to eat there. We've tried a handful of menu items and recommend the ghost pepper fries as a great appetizer. You have to give this pizza joint a shot- you WONT regret it. Crunchy but flavorful crust, just enough cheese and toppings to give a taste of everything on the pizza, and the marinara is amazing and homemade!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, give me some!!!

Do you want authentic, handmade, quality ingredients for your pie?  Do you enjoy watching your pizza get made by someone who cares that he is providing you with a good product?  Then you should stop by Bistro.

While I have walked in and ordered what I wanted (after checking out their website to see what online deals he is offering), you can take home a menu and order over the phone.  Since this isn't pizza hut/domino's, your pizza isn't made on an assembly line and will take time to make and bake.  

Don't forget the amazing bistro salad, yummy garlic knots & bistro fries.  I think that they have calzones and such, but when the pizza is this good, I don't bother to stray."}
{"text":"I am from upstate NY and this pizza is not good . If you want good pizza go to Grimaldi's .  I thought the pizza was greasy and it had no flavor.. The guy was very friendly though."}
{"text":"What a great find! I had the gluten-free pizza while by BF had the normal pizza with sausage and mushroom. He said his was amazing - excellent crust with the perfect amount of crunch, great toppings, perfect red sauce that wasn't too sweet (and he's super picky). The GF crust was really tasty - different than I've ever had. Crispy and perfectly done. We also ordered the fries with were very yummy. We even enjoyed watching the owner as he prepared the pizzas with great care. We were visiting Vegas and drove over to Henderson to check it out. Wish we lived closer, we'd definitely come often!!"}
{"text":"First time ordering and it was very easy and friendly. No delivery but no problem the menu looked intriguing that it was worth the short drive. We had the chicken parmesan sliders (on garlic knots : - ) \"YUMMY\" and the Spinach Artichoke Dip even won over my 17 year old son who is very picky. It was not only well balanced and delicious but the pita slices for dipping were toasted nice and crispy with a parmesan dusting that just made it perfect. Already planning my next football party! 5 Thumbs Up Bistro! Can't wait to try your pasta dinner options!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We eat pizza quite a bit and we think this place has some of the best. The chicken parm sliders are yummy, too."}

First time but definitely not last.
The garlic bread was excellent."}

{"text":"***UPDATE***

I tried them again this Thursday and there were no children or crowds. Looks like I caught them on an off Thursday.

Pizza was great as per usual!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Have never written a review on help even though I've been reading them for years. I just have to say Bistro Pizza has the best pizza in Henderson. Maybe even all of Vegas. The pizza looks good, maybe a little unassuming, but once I bite into a slice I start getting memories of all the delicious pizza's I've eaten throughout my life. That good. I have say it's definitely the dough and the way they keep it simple. I also love their chicken wings tossed in sweet chili. I live walking distance and I'm so happy to have them so close."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned there is not always a delivery driver working, which is a major reason why it has taken me as long as it has to try Bistro Pizza out. We almost always want delivery when we decide to order a pizza, and every single time we have tried to get a pizza delivered from Bistro they have not had a driver available. 

I was out running errands on a Sunday when my husband requested that I bring home a veggie pizza. He suggested I get it from Bistro since I was going to be in that area. I called in the order, and in hindsight I should have asked for pricing to avoid the sticker shock that ensued later... 

At Bistro there is no such thing as a veggie pizza, you just pick a size (large is $15) and then add your toppings ($1.75 each). Bistro does have a lot of toppings to choose from, and it's probably partially my fault we ended up with a pizza that neither of us cared all that much for.. I ended up with a $30+ dollar pizza with so many toppings, it was difficult to taste any cheese or sauce. 

The crust was excellent, I'll go back to Bistro for a plain cheese pizza or perhaps a pie with just 1-2 toppings. And 5 stars for the garlic knots. Those things are delish, and getting them for free thanks to the Yelp check-in offer only makes them better."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good pies with some really nice people working there. We will definitely be back to give this place another go. The staff really makes you feel welcome here!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy pizza sold at the airport or bus station, this is your place.  If you think this pizza is good at all, it's time to visit a different state and try pizza elsewhere.  Even bad pizza in California can run circles around this horrible pizza place.

They claim to make thin crust pizza -- we received a dry puffy WHITE crust (nothing golden) that resembled a product made from instant or  frozen dough.  The sauce tasted like it came from a can and had no herbs and/or spices.  The cheese was cheap  Sbarro quality (look where they ended up).

The reviews for this establishment are GROSSLY exaggerated.  We should have known this restaurant was a DUD because the menu contains buffalo wings and other hihgly processed frozen appetizer crap.

Customer service was also void at this restaurant.  The gentleman with the glasses and beard even ignored my husband as he stood at the counter trying to place an order.  Never as much lifted his head."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food was very good, you can tell everything is cooked with quality ingredients"}
{"text":"This is the first time we have been here and it was awesome. Our favorite pizza in town is Aurillios. Since they are on the other side of town, we had to find a good pizza joint and we did with Bistro Pizza. The place is small the mom and pop kind of place. The service is awesome and the pizza was very good. We have found our favorite pizza place in henderson. We will definatly will be going back."}
{"text":"I usually have a ceasar salad and pizza but going for the lasagna instead my favorite pizza in town.  love this place and the entire crew and best garlic rolls in all of vegas
reyn Don't miss this place it's a hidden gem....."}
{"text":"Amazing , service was good delicious ny style pizza sadwitch was delish, as well.as my wings this will remain my pizza spot"}
{"text":"\"Will Work For Food\" read the sign of the guy I found to help with some top to bottom house cleaning.  OK, maybe not.  But I do have a friend who has been helping out.  He actually is willing to work for some pizza and a Dr. Pepper.  As payment, I brought him to Bistro Pizza.  I saw the strong Yelp reviews as well as the offer for free order of garlic knots with a Yelp check-in.  It was on at that point.

This is some good pizza made with quality fresh ingredients.  Each pizza is made to order and 100% customizeable.  There are no cookie cutter prefab options here.  We ordered a large pizza with sausage, green bell pepper, mushroom and olives.  Plus the garlic knots with my check-in, of course.  

The knots were out first.  They were still slightly doughy inside which we both agreed was perfect.  They were buttery and slightly garlicy.  The big punch of garlic came from the chunks of fresh garlic in the marinara.  Everything about it was great.  And to make it better, there were six knots of comparible size.  Each of us got 3 and neither felt cheated.

When the pizza arrived a few minutes later and shortly after finishing our knots, I was shocked by how heavy handed this place is on the toppings.  It was nearly impossible to eat this pizza with out a fork and knife.  The full coverage of cheese.  The fresh mushrooms and bell peppers.  The ground mild Italian sausage.  All of it was perfect and not skimpy in the least.  There were so many toppings I was starting to feel full after just 2 slices.  I ended up taking a couple of slices home. I had some family come in from out of town later that day and they enjoyed a slice.  I had the final slice a day later.  It was just as good reheated.

The overall feel of Bistro Pizza is not one of high class.  This is a little pizza joint that doesn't pretend to be anything more.  There is paper and crayons on each table for some simple entertainment as you wait for your food.  The walls along the counter and pizza making station are lined with drawings from past customers.  You really get the impression that the staff here care for their customers.  They display their art work and they joke around with you.  It feels like old friends just hanging out when you come in here.

I will be back for my pizza fix again."}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice crust. Good salads and nice staff. The only thing I didn't like was 2 of the 4 plates we got were dirty."}
{"text":"So first off, food is amazing. Garlic knots absolutely live up to the hype, pizza crust is the right kind of chewy and tender, downright awesome. 

But then it gets better. We had ordered through BiteSquad and they were out of one of the calzone fillings we wanted. Since they couldn't get a hold of us immediately, they put in the calzone without the missing filling and started it anyway, just in case we were in a hurry. When I got there to pick it up, they told me about the issue and offered to make us a new one with a different filling if I was willing to wait, which I was. They gave us the first calzone as well anyway, because they would have had to throw it out anyway. THAT kind of customer service and considerate thinking is what'll make me come back here again and again and again."}
{"text":"In Henderson for some spring break.  We were craving pizza and saw the great reviews. We were not disappointed! Excellent pizza and the guys working there were super friendly. 
We will be back for more pizza and maybe sliders next time!"}
{"text":"Walked in and no one greeted me , standing there with my son and the workers didn't bother helping don't know what they were doing, so I left, really wanted to try this place but as your first impression not good upon me, sad experience!"}
{"text":"One of the managers name of Travis introduced himself, apologized for the wait, and gave me 2 complimentary garlic knots. Very nice. Awesome knots."}
{"text":"BISTRO PIZZZZZAAAAAA IS THE SPOT!!!!   

I am so upset that it took me a year and a half of living here before finding this perfect Mom and pop pizza joint! This spot screams quintessential neighborhood pizzeria. 

The smell is inviting and smiling faces on \"The line\" are quick to greet and assist you.  

We started with a Bistro salad and bistro fries (thanks to all the yelp suggestions,) and I'm so happy we did. The veggies in this salad are so flavorful. whatever they marinade the tomatoes in is phenomenal. My non tomato eating husband was eating them. This says a lot y'all. 
The salad is full, and the perfect amount for two plates full and maybe even a little to take home! 

The fries. Omg those bistro fries. They came out smoking hot and smelt like heaven. We're hooked. If you are a French fry lover, this is A total must with every order. There wasn't a fry left behind. This was the first empty plate. 

We ordered a LARGE pepperoni pizza and got a FREE order of garlic knots with a yelp check in! **scoreeeee**
Both my 4 year old and husband were drooling over their pie as they mmm'ed with each bite. 

I ordered a small pizza with onion, artichoke, and green peppers. IT WAS SO SO SO SO TASTY. The only tip I would give for a veggie pizza would be ask for an extra sauce. Their sauce is next level. For real.... I wanted to drink it. 

We got all of our food for around 40 bucks. It was an incredible price for the amount of food that we bought. Can't wait for tomorrow's leftovers and I especially can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with more than just pizza!  I work close so my coworkers and I are in quite often.  Tyler the owner/chef takes pride in his work.  Other than pizza, bistro has wings, tenders, salads, meatball and garlic Parmesan sliders, and much more!  I haven't tried everything on the menu but I'm sure ill get there soon.  Haven't had anything from here that I haven't been a fan of! 

5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"The calzone I ordered was good, but only mozzarella cheese.  Our table also ordered a small pizza, which smelled great and I'm told tasted great.

The owner and an employee were both friendly and welcoming. It's a small strip mall, store-front place.

Minuses: They were out of sub rolls so I could not try my first option of the chick parm sandwich. The dining area was too warm as if the A/C was off that day."}
{"text":"As local, typical pizza joint as you can get. Bistro Pizza is pretty good. 
Touro students get a discount- $10.00 for a large one topping pizza? (It's normally $15) You can't beat that! Too bad pizzas taste better with more than one topping :) 
I only wish there was a menu with pizzas with the toppings already chosen for you. I can never make up my mind on what toppings I want! 

Service is if-y. We ordered pizza to go and sat in a seat directly in front of the cashier to wait. After 15+ minutes we asked how much longer it would be- turns out the pizzas were already done and they failed to call us up. Don't let that happen to you! 
Yelp check in gets you free garlic knots with the order of a large pizza. You can't get the garlic knots if you use the Touro deal!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town, for several reasons. My followers know I very rarely eat at chains, it's just what I like. This is a family run business that takes much pride in their work. The ambiance is casual and comfortable, and you can see the crew making your food as ordered. And it's every bit worth the little extra wait. Let's face it, fast, cheap pizza is fast and cheap for a reason. And many people are ok with that. I'm not. 
I'm very picky about my calzone. Some places try to overdo it. Bistro nails it. The dough is soft and fluffy, not heavy, and baked to perfection, not like a brick. It fluffy up so big that the to-go box it comes in can't be closed! Inside is more deliciousness. High quality mozzarella that when you tilt your back just falls into your mouth.  Accompanied by creamy ricotta. Not all cheese is equal! You can absolutely tell the difference in the high quality here. Then there is the spinach. It is fresh! Not frozen and chopped. And the garlic is fresh, not that stuff in a jar. It is all rounded out with the most delicious marinara, of which I love so much I order extra. This is what guilty pleasures are made of. 
Then, there is my son, spaghetti connoisseur. This is the only place, outside of my kitchen, that he will order it. And he is a tough critic! 
If you aren't hungry by now, I haven't done my job. Do yourself a favor, next time you want Italian, check this gem out. You can thank me later. 
Ciao!"}
{"text":"It's just okay.  The cashier robbed me of some change when I paid cash even though I did it out of consideration for the fact that it's a small, local restaurant... even if it's as little as 4 cents it's the principle of the matter...  If he didn't have the necessary pennies he should give me 20 cents back or say that he doesn't have the necessary change and we could have worked things out.  The fact he just took my money in hopes that I would tip or not notice...disappointing.

Always use credit card here so you won't have to deal with this issue."}
{"text":"We were in Henderson and wanted pizza so I yelped it and Bistro had top ratings. We tried it and not what everyone makes it sound out to be. Garlic knots were too buttery and hard, side salad had too many tomatoes that were marinated, they were soggy and did not go well with the ranch. Pizza was mediocre...we won't visit again!"}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary experience. The pizza is better than post places but did not stand out to me. We got a large pepperoni and... well it was OK. It's better than several Pizzeria's that I've been to, but it does not really stand out. The garlic knots here are huge and pretty good. I think I liked the garlic knots better than the pizza. I may have to try them again to solidify my opinion but I do not see that happening since they're a little bit of a drive and there is pizza near by that I really like.
The location is pretty spacious and one thing I liked is that they have scrabble! Corny? SO! You can play scrabble while you wait for your pizza! What I did not like is that the guy behind the counter had dirty nails and confessed to work in a body shop too. Needles to say, I was really worried about getting the pizza there but thankfully he wasn't the one making it. The chef's hands and nails were perfectly clean :)"}
{"text":"Calzone and stromboli were soggy as hell. Pretty over rated if you ask me. Havent tried the pizza but after these awful meals i dont think i will."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new pizza place to try and found Bistro Pizza on Yelp. When we arrived to pick up the order, the place was packed! I took that as a good sign. The pizza was delicious. I've never had such a good white pizza! I can't wait to try some of the other menu items. They have some great specials on their web site. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just attempted to try this place for the first time. Called in a order for pickup was told it would take 30-45 min. We drive to pick it up and were told when entering that there was no slip for pickup. I called back the number I used to place the order to make sure it was the right location and the same guy answered. He said yea I don't know there's no slip for the order. It'll take another 20 minutes. No explanation what happened no offers to make it right. Bad service."}
{"text":"Pizza was tasty but soggy.  Biggest complaint is lack of attention to detail in the order.  Ordered a salad that was supposed to come with \"featured fresh bread.\"  No such bread was delivered."}
{"text":"Came back and ordered a large this time and it was an improvement. 

Pepperoni with mushrooms and this time they didn't skimp on the toppings.  The crust was amazing as always with a light crunch and the pizza base has the perfect cornmeal portion. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile, but have had trouble trying them since they are always so busy. Even pick-up can be an hour and a half wait. Yikes. A late Saturday lunch afforded us a mere 30 minute wait for takeout. 

I ordered a Pepperoni Pizza, a Bistro Salad, and Garlic Knots. The order of Garlic Knots was free with Yelp check-in. The Pepperoni Pizza was pretty good. It isn't the best pizza in the area, but still good. It certainly wasn't lacking on cheesy goodness. The Garlic Knots were covered in butter and parmesan. They were good as well. The Bistro Salad isn't a traditional salad and more a blend of salad ingredients without lettuce. This was okay.

Bistro Pizza is definitely a good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and equally as delicious food!  My boyfriend and I ordered pizza and wings and it was some of the best we've had.  We will definitely be back to try some more delicious food. Thanks guys for the delicious food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I'm always craving this place 
I always buy their spicy chicken fingers and ghost chili pepper fries 

I'm also obsessed with their ghost chili powder they sell to their customers 

Definitely a homey environment 
Plus they have a fee board games to play on 
And you get to draw on the table parchment and sometimes they'll tape it on the wall"}
{"text":"Saw all the great reviews on Yelp and had to try this place. We were very happy we did! So close to home and love the neighborhood pizzeria feel. Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word. Thanks to Yelp we saved 50% off our pizza order just for checking in today between 2-5pm."}
{"text":"Drove in from Cali and found this place on Yelp with high stars so I checked out the menu and everything looked great. So I called them up and a really nice young man answered the phone and took my order. Not only did he let me order with out interrupting me, but he also repeated my order back to me perfectly! When I arrived at the restaurant and opened the door not only was I greeted with a yummy smell, but the employees welcomed me! My order was ready and 2 helpful employees went over my food to assure me that it was all there and accurate. I can't say enough about how nice this experience was. The food was delicious and my tummy is pleasantly full!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was amazing. To top it off we tried the garlic knots and it topped off our dinner. Will definitely be back when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I was in town for work, and my co-worker and I decided to give it a try. 

Pizza was great, and the owner was super friendly. If I ever make it back to this place, I will be sure to swing by here and get some more pizza!"}
{"text":"Great Pie! Terrific crust, good sauce. A very good NY style pie. I only wish they did an 18\" pie. 16\" pies just don't seem to do a NY style pie justice."}
{"text":"The pizza is GREAT! First time here and after my first bite, I was sold! Definitely coming back TOMORROW because there is a half off a large pizza coupon when it's your first check in! Tomorrow will NOT be the last time I come here. I will be a regular no doubt!"}
{"text":"Staff greeted us with a warm welcome and food was deliciously made with fresh ingredients! 

How it works: you can dine in or pickup/ delivery. 
You seat yourselves in a 4-seater booth and when you're ready to order drinks or food, you go up to the cashier to place your order. Food is served at the table when ready. Drink refills are self serve / next to the cashier. 

Currently if you check-in on Yelp, you get a complimentary order of garlic knots (which are so yummy!). 

The ghost pepper fries had a hint of sweetness and ended with an addictive zesty/ spicy kick. 

Pizza was absolutely amazing and you could really taste the fresh ingredients from the sauce to the cheese! 
We definitely will be returning to try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS. It's just so good. Garlic knots cannot be overstated. We get calzone or stromboli a lot and they are both amazing. The dough is perfect and the sauce is really good. They are generous protions and lots of chees and good stuff. My wife likes the huge salads. The place is a little bit... vintage... but you don't come here for some trendy decorations: you come here for the FOOD! 

The staff is great. They always seem to be having fun when we're in there and are super nice to our little girl. Great place for kids. Can't say enough good. This is a frequent family place for us!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for some pizza tonight and this came up on the Yelp! app as nearby from the location of town I happened to be in at the time. Ordered a medium sausage and black olive pizza. The crust was very good as well as the sausage, cheese, and sauce. The black olives were a bit off and didn't taste quite right though (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Good service and the restaurant, while a small pizzeria, seemed clean. The staff is very friendly as well. Other items on the menu ordered by others looked very good too. I will give it a try again in the near future."}
{"text":"Very good family atmosphere. Friendly staff. Small shop with eat in tables as well as take out. Great food. The medium  pizza was like many pizza places' large size. Kinda tucked away behind the 76 station on gibson, just south of the freeway ramp. Will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"great pizza, great service, great pictures posted from customers. We order a large pie with garlic and it was great. If u check in, u get free garlic knots...and they taste awesome.  I will definitely be back sooner than later. Great time and really enjoyed the pizza. Quick, friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"We took the pizza to go. Super nice service, I believe he's the owner. Very fresh ingredients, I scarfed down the pizza rather quickly and enjoyed every bite. I'd say if you're looking for a reasonably priced pizza with real, fresh ingredients try Bistro Pizza! I did not dine in so I can't comment on that, but the ambiance looked nice and family friendly. I love having great pizza close to my house!"}
{"text":"Live across the street and this pizza is awesome! 
We've ordered it multiple times when family is over."}
{"text":"Love bistro pizza! Pizza is always good and they have weekly specials which is nice. It's much better than a going to a chain and I like supporting a local business."}
{"text":"Feels like little Italy. Tyler takes pride in what he does. Great food ..loved it. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"get the garlic knots! and the fettuccine alfredo =) the service here is perfect as well. Not intrusive but extremely helpful. Certainly coming here every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"We are not from around here and came to Bistro's pizza because of Yelp ratings. We love this place. First, they were very accommodating in letting us put four separate toppings on each quarter of a large pizza.  My son and I got salads, and the quality is very, very good. Then the pizza came. Great all-around taste, great crust, sauce, and cheese. Very, very happy with this place and the excellent service."}
{"text":"Great pizza/ food. Service and staff friendliness is just ok. They are VERY mom and pop, so you never know if they are going to be accommodating, or friendly or answer their phone or even be open. I'm giving 5 stars solely based on the delicious food and the customer service not being THAT bad. They're only human and the mediocre service is worth the food! We keep it simple usually ordering pepperoni pizza, garlic knots and wings! All very good and delicious. Definitely give this place a try and hope for the best with customer service, you're usually in and out of there anyway."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is one of my favorite places to grab pizza or sliders. They have great food and great prices. You should go to their web site to see daily specials. Their garlic knots and ghost fries are the best sound."}
{"text":"The best garlic knots I have ever had!  Delicious garlic flavor, without being too salty or too doughy.  I was surprised at how light and fresh they tasted.  If you like garlic knots, it's worth coming out of your way just to get these.

The pizza was a good value, but just not to my personal taste.  It was definitely New York style, with a strong herbs taste.  It was just a little too much cheese and grease for me, I prefer a lighter style of pizza. 

The $4.99 sliders are a fabulous value for a lunch-size meal (although they are available anytime).  The fries could have been a tad more crispy.

The customer service was friendly.  If you like New York style pizza, you should try this place out for sure."}
{"text":"You step in the door of this place and are consumed by the overwhelming smell of  fresh bread and garlic.  I was giggling at the pizza delivery guys hole in his shorts, but was quickly greeted by the cashier (owner?) who rapidly delivered my Pizza I had ordered over the phone.  We got home to eat our pizza but started with our free garlic knots (for checking in on Yelp). Ohhh EMMM Geeee the garlic knots were so fresh and HOT and buttery and perfect!!. After a couple of those I started in on the pizza.  I have now found the BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS!!  These people have perfected pizza. The sauce is amazing! The texture of the crust perfect! The cooking time was spot on.  The pepperoni, ham and pineapple was perfectly spread across the pizza and all amazingly fresh. (its so hard to find fresh food in Vegas). I cannot tell you enough how happy I am to find a GREAT Pizza place with great service.  The booths to sit in were very bright and cozy looking. Im so happy to patronize a small business and spread the word for SUCCESS!!"}
{"text":"Been here to dine in a few times since our first time.  Still GREAT food and friendly service.  I love that its always consistent.  I've tried pizzas, stromboli, bistro salad, garlic knots, parmesan sliders, ghost fries, and LOVED everything!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place but the food is insane!!! Garlic knots, Ghost Fries, lasagna and pizza.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Service was friendly and excellent."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food we've had in the Vegas area. Pepperoni, sausage, mushroom  pizza is the bomb. Wife's spaghetti and meatballs was probably the best she's had."}
{"text":"Bistro is never a fail! My hubby and the kids love this place so much. So glad we found our go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"We tried Bistro after seeing tons of great reviews, and they had gluten free crust. The service was great, but the pies weren't anything special ... And left both of us with nasty tummy aches--and we had two different things! Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great, great, great pizza.  Our food order from a different restaurant fell through and we were in a jam.  Came in and the owner started making our pizzas immediately.  He put the toppings on while we shouted them out and put them in the oven right away.  Finished in 15 minutes and the pizzas were fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to pull Bistro Pizza out of my 5 Star lists. While the pizza itself it still good, there were issues and attitudes with an individual behind the counter than reached a point that we took our business elsewhere. I won't give Bistro Pizza one star as these Yelp reviews do get read and I don't want to hurt the business. But when ordering comfort food which is what pizza is for us, I don't want a side of attitude or surliness to come with it. 

Dropping to 3 stars and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"2nd time there. pizza was so good I had to go back. Got a Large meatball pizza and garlic knots. Everything was delicious. Will definitely go back. This is some of the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas/Henderson. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This wasnt bad pizza. I just lived in a city with a really great pizza culture.. so i was really let down when i moved back home. This wasn't  horrible this wasn't great ... is was just okay . 
THe garlic knots .. just okay .. and the wings ... and service was meh"}
{"text":"Now this place is what I'm talkin' about! Talk about good service and bomb food, this is the place.  I recently found out about this place and it's seriously walking distance from my house! Good and bad being that I probably order every other week.  

I'll start with the service. Whether you're calling in an order, or going to there to order, EXPECT EXCELLENT SERVICE, cause that's all they have.  :) Nuff said. I mostly call in my orders and wait impatiently for my food cause it's soo good.

Walk in to the place, and it's not huge.  A few booths along the wall and 1 round table.  They also have a few games to play, or books to read as time passes for your food. Such a warm and cozy family vibe when you walk in.  You can tell there is love flowing through that place.  When I go to pick up my food, there are always people in the booths and they have nothing but smiles.  Families bring their kids, because it is kiddo friendly.  

I can honestly say this place has the best pizza.  I eat a lot of pizza, and have had it from different places since birth, and this is one of the best.  The crust is perfect.  Usually I'll leave the crust for someone else to eat, but not here.  If you don't want your crust, slide it over to the left hand side.  I will gladly dip it in some ranch and finish it for you.  

One of my favs! Try it out and experience genuine smiles, food made with care and satisfied taste buds.  Can't forget to mention the garlic knots! Those are also scrumptious!"}
{"text":"This place was very good friendly and clean. I thought the pizza and wings could use more sauce but thats more of a personal preference than anything. I loved that the marinara sauce was heated up, I hate going somewhere and its served cold. Also had the gatlic knots...fantastic and the bistro fries, we used to go to a place that had what they called italian fries whick were just like the bistro fries but with marinara and melted cheese on them wish they had that here. Expensive especially if you order several side items and the cost of extra items on the pizza is outragous but when we have extra money we would come back here, not often but maybe every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Loved the Garlic knots. The pizza is delicious, everything was fresh. The best I've had near Las Vegas. Great welcoming and friendly staff! Will definitely be our go to spot when in Vegas..."}
{"text":"We just picked up our first pizza from Bistro Pizza and this guy nailed it. We ordered a meatball and ricotta pizza and it was perfect. The dough was on point, the sauce was nicely seasoned and the toppings were generous. We loved it. We also got an order of garlic knots and we really enjoyed them. This will definitely be our go to pizza place from now on!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place, the food is awesome and the staff is super friendly! Try the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF FAKE STARS
Second time ordering to give them another chance. NO LUCK!
I ordered a Hawaiian Calzone, large pizza 5 toppings, med pizza 3 toppings and a side of meatballs. The Calzone has SOOOO SOGGY (a 1/4 cup of juice I retained from it, saved it too, cause I was going to march right back up there to show the manager)  I did not, instead I called, he was quite \"matter of fact\" in his defense of this shabby meal I paid over $54 for!
 I said I only tried this place BECAUSE OF THE GOOD YELP REVIEWS. And with this meal, I would have to be honest and write a bad one. HE DID NOT CARE WHAT SO EVER!!!! His exact words were \"GO AHEAD\"
 After a back and forth argument he did say he would give me A  free pizza or make it right the next time I come in. BIG DEAL after  paying for delivery, and trying to convey my CLEARLY poor meal to him over the phone, (i even offered to text or e-mail pictures of this slop I had of a meal on my table, not interested)
I do NOT want any of your FREE FOOD! I just want to maybe help someone else from wasting their money! I guess if I owned a business I would ask all my friends to write five star reviews also."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bistro Pizza!  The service is amazing!!  What I love best is when I walk in the staff remembers me and remembers that I am allergic to gluten!  

For the first time I can eat pizza (gluten free) and not get sick.  The service is always fast and friendly and the food is amazing!  I have suggested this to my coworkers, family, and friends who have all agreed that this is the best pizza place in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I always go here and get the bistro salad and garlic knots both of which are amazing. I decided to try something different so I went with a pizza with spinach and mushrooms and of course I couldn't forget the garlic knots. The Pizza was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and the sauce full of flavor. Garlic knots were amazing as always. It reminds me of NYC but without having to go 3,000 miles. 

One of the best pizza places I have tried yet. The owner is a very nice guy who is very personable. It is located in a little strip mall off of 215/Gibson. It's kind of hidden you wouldn't really know it's there unless you happen to be driving by. I will definitely be having pizza again the next time I visit or maybe even decide to try another one of the dishes on the menu. I would highly recommend trying this place to anybody who has not yet found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The S/O got a coupon from restaurant.com to go here and I'm glad we did. We took the kids this time. 

This place is pretty close to home which is even better.

Its a small place but those tend to be the best places. The owner greeted us and was making pizzas at the same time. 

This place is very kid friendly. The give them a big piece of butcher paper and the kids can draw. Its a great distraction for us parents! The owner also lets them hang their artwork on the wall.

They GF was very happy  because they had gluten free pizza too! Its pretty rare and a great treat for her. 

We got a few big pizzas for everyone to share and an order of their famous garlic knots. 

The kids watched their pizzas being made and loved it. They pizza maker tosses the pizza in the air old school style. It really is an art form. I wish I could do that!

The pizza was delicious and kid approved too. The crust had great texture and was perfectly cooked.

The gluten free pizza was pretty good too. It didn't have the rubbery texture most of them have. 

The garlic knots, OMG they were AH MAZ ING! They are the best I have ever had. I had to tell the GF they were terrible and I choked on them since she is gluten free. SHHHH!

All in all, it was a great visit. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Large pizza and a penne pasta for $20. I can feed the wife and kids with that. The pasta is so delicious and has a fair amount of meat in it. And with the pizza we just add an extra topping or two and we always have some left over."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, free garlic knots were great and wings were decent. Id say food overall a 3 but great service for my takeout makes it an overall 4."}
{"text":"Really like the garlic knot sliders.
Pizza is good with generous amounts of toppings, this is probably what lends to the limp crust.
We had stromboli on this last order, the italian in the family really enjoyed it with the ricotta."}
{"text":"Had a restaurant.com coupon and it was close to our new house so we decided to give it a try. When I arrived, the owner was busy making pizzas. We ordered a large, 3 topping pizza, 2 orders of garlic bread, medium wings, and teriyaki wings to go. Probably waited about 20 minutes for our order. The food was GREAT! We enjoyed ALL of it. Next time I'm going to try some of the pasta. Can't wait to go back. Owner was friendly. Runs a nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered Takeout though postmates and I ordered the chicken fingers with fries, fries arrived soggy and chicken fingers were soggy and drenched in sauce, the texture of the chicken was like chicken nuggets from McDonald's, I don't feel it was real chicken more processed chicken fingers that they heat up from a frozen bag, not ordering again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings and decent price. It took like 15 min to be served. I GIVE this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"Returned here after a disappointing first visit, and glad that we did.  Tyler stands behind his business and makes sure his customers are satisfied. Ordered a large ricotta and meatball pizza and he threw in an order of super garlic-y knots (they were so good Tyler) pizza was loaded with the toppings and cooked perfectly.  Definitely our pizza place in Henderson now!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review in the most obnoxious way possible: I'm from NY. :) So I have pretty high expectations of a pizza place that advertises 'NY style thin crust pizza'. I ordered a plain cheese pie and a pepperoni pie for lunch for my employees. First let me say that walking in, I had high hopes! It smelled fantastic! A good sign. The set up also reminded me of a pizza place I might see in NY, so bonus points for that. 

Both were 'large' pies, but not the usual 18\" large that I'm used to. The crust had good flavor, but I think if they used the same amount of dough and stretched it the extra two inches, it would be just a little thinner. Then if they cooked it a few minutes longer, it would get that bottom of the crust snap that NY pizza has. It was just a little too chewy. (Also, if they are making the crust on site, what water are they using? That makes a huge difference in bread products.)

The sauce was decent, better than expected. I think they could use a little more cheese, but I'm a cheese monster so I won't ding them for it. 

All in all, considering some of the other 'options' that are around, I thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Service was great.
Person making the pizza and taking orders was very patient and answered all our many questions without ever seeming annoyed.

Food was good. Nothing I personally would go out of my way for, but if you are in the area it is a good solid meal for a decent price.  And a lot of people seem to love them, so try them out and decide for yourself! The pizza crust is delicious and they are not stingy with the cheese at all.  And they have gluten free options which is nice of them.

I love supporting small businesses so will return whenever in the area and craving pizza. 

What my stars mean: 

5 is outstanding, a must-experience, someplace I would bring/recommend to a tourist

4 is great, someplace I would love to go back to again and again. Backup options to bring/recommend to a tourist 

3 is good. Someplace I would return to if in the area. I probably wouldn't recommend to a tourist, but possibly to a local. 

2 is ok but only because it is either cheap or convenient.

1 means I would not return"}
{"text":"Garlic knots and bistro fries were pretty good, along with the service but our pastas, spaghetti and chicken alfredo, were very bland.. Particularly the Alfredo which looked and tasted completely devoid of flavor.. I would like to come back and try their pizza as it seems that is their specialty but for now, 3 stars"}
{"text":"We moved to Vegas 3.5 years ago from Connecticut and we've been searching for our pizza place since then. We thought maybe it was Rocco's Pizza but we tried Bistro tonight and it's the winner hands down.

The garlic knots were the best I've had outside of New York City and the pizza was super fresh and delicious! The sauce is light tasting (not pasty) and chunky which is just like we like. The dough is phenomenal and cooked just right. Toppings are generous and fresh - you're not searching for your toppings here!

Lastly, the service seals the deal. The employees are happy, welcoming and make the atmosphere feel fun. Oh! And coloring on the table is the best for littles.

If you haven't tried this place do it this week!"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, not a fan of the crust. Garlic knots were over cooked so they had a burnt taste to them."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great tasting cheese and crust!  I live in the neighborhood, and I never knew until today about this little gem!  BTW Ghost pepper is a very good product as well.  I ordered the large pizza with meatballs, wow!  The garlic knots and sauce - outstanding!  I plan to make this a frequent choice when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because it was pretty good and inexpensive. The service was friendly and very fast to feed 3 starving teenagers. We ordered the garlic knots and a large cheese pizza. The place is a little hole in the wall and doesn't look nice, but we all felt it was pretty clean. Definitely a nice spot to go if you want fast pizza at a great price."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza here.  For one, this place is so close to my house it's insane.  I was expecting mediocre pizza for a good price.  I was happily proved wrong as the pizza was great!  One Pepperoni and one Hawaiian, along with some Garlic Knots and Wings.  Not only was everything great but there's a Yelp check in offer for half off a pizza.  Total steal.  

I did get my  food to-go so I could sit in jammies with my wife and friend while sipping on Mason Jars full of Shandy's, but the inside looked pretty awesome.  Anytime there are trivia, games, or trivia games I'm a happy camper.  I didn't see any beer though, which might be a problem.

Bottom Line:  If you live close to this place, give it a shot.  If you far away, get there and try it."}
{"text":"Great place for NY pizza. Service was outstanding.  Best meatball pizza We have had in years. Garlic knots are huge.  Our new pizza joint in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"I did pick this pizza place based on the star rating. I am sorry I was not impressed at all.  Are they paying for stars was my first thought??? Yelp had an offer for free garlic knots if you check in and they would not honor it.  Yelp should take that down.  Ok, fine.  Not worth arguing with the guy.  Picked up the pizza and left.   I knew as soon as I opened the box and I saw the pizza it was not worth the 4 and a half stars.  Eating it ... You can get Papa Johns for half the price.  Bistro pizza is definitely not worth what they are charging.  If you want good pizza I think it's worth paying the extra $4 to go to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"The number one reason for me writing this review is for the owner of the company- as a small business owner, I am sure this is something you would want to know. 

My boyfriend and I called Bistro Pizza 30 minutes before close wanting to make an order for delivery- we were notified by an employee that there was no delivery driver on duty. *which I kind of expected considering I read a lot of yelp reviews.* my boyfriend asked if it would still be okay for us to order, we were then told by the employee that \"of course you can still order , but just so you know we close in 20 minutes.\" Technically 30 we called at 830, but I'll give it to you.  With a comment like that, making us feel like we are totally putting you out; we decided to order from another company. ( Marcos Pizza )

Not only did this experience Leave a bad taste in our mouth but it also lost your company a one time sale, but also a prospective returning client ( who's boyfriend really loves pizza) due to bad customer service.

If you'd like to get ahold of us for any questions feel free.

With all this being said we ordered our dinner from marcos ( right down the road on Stephanie). There is a review on their account from my experience as well.."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight. Med pizza had lots of cheese and real fresh mushrooms, much better than the chains. If you live in Henderson give em a try."}
{"text":"Travis has the best customer service ever. The garlic knots are a must. The bae and I are definitely coming back!! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with great prices.

Fresh veggies and ingredients and not very greasy.  

Staff was so friendly and very attentive.  Wonderful to dine in or take out.

Its a great place for your basic pizzas.  Prices are excellent... Cheap.  
Med (12\") 1 topping pizza was $11... extra toppings are a little over $1 each
They also have a small pizza special with drink for about $7.  (I didn't see the sign until we were done eating)

I wouldn't expect a pizza full of different and unique toppings, its a great basic pizza place that makes its to perfection.  Crust is excellent.. hand tossed!

Garlic knots were great!  Its free with your yelp check in... an awesome extra

I highly recommend it and I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Disappointed based on all of the excellent reviews. Perhaps it was an off night for them, I hope so. Atmosphere is basic cold pizza place in a strip mall, super bright fluorescent lights.....which was exactly what we were looking for that night. Several people working behind the counter... my cousin and took a seat at a booth...we had to ask someone how /where to order...and were told after we had decided what we wanted to get up and go back to the front counter to order... that was fine that night but would have been incredibly irritating on a busy night if you had to get up from your table and wait in line behind walk ins or pick ups...meanwhile, our table was literally 3 ft from a \"service\" counter on the side...we could have just talked to the guy behind the counter if he would have allowed it...ok, we did get up and go to the front. The gentleman behind the counter when we went back to order wouldn't / didn't make eye contact with us ( the restaurant was dead when we were there at 6:30 on a Tuesday). The phone rang and counter guy answered the phone, took a pick up order...still not acknowledging us or even glancing our way...after hanging up he went in the back, talks to other staff...comes back out..instead of taking our order proceeds to wipe the prep counters ( with his back to us still)...shuffles a few things around, stirs some fresh prepped veggies, and then seemingly satisfied that there was absolutely nothing else he could do to flat out ignore us turned towards us and said \"yes gentleman, what can I help you with\" ( we were about 30 seconds away from saying screw it and just leaving at that point) um, we would like to order dinner? We order, get charged, he disappears... (we did not order pizza...probably a big mistake) just not in the mood on that night...salads came out in about 10 minutes,  the food came out about 15 minutes later steaming hot and looking really good... a plate of garlic knots was served with our salads...they were excellent, although really oily. The lasagna and baked penny were both meh...kind of bland and strangely unsatisfying. The portions were fairly large. My cousins comment was \"perfectly ok\" ...meaning it was a perfect \"ok\" quality, not something either of us would make the 5 minute drive back for. My cousin asked for a side of bread with his penne, this seemed really confusing to the cook who served the pasta...they finally after a group talk decided they could in fact do \"just garlic bread\" for us... what came out was a small sub roll cut in half with garlic oil baked onto it...again, perfectly ok... 4 /3\" pieces on the plate. We finished and I stopped at the counter to see if there was a charge for the \"just garlic bread\"... well yes there was- $4.30. Seemed like a lot for 6\" of sub roll cut into 4 pieces but at that point we just needed to leave. We both really wanted this to be a new regular spot. We won't be back."}
{"text":"So I love the food here but every time I call regardless if it's a monday at 7pm or a Friday at 5pm, they never have delivery. I just called and the girl said she would call me back after she finds out if they can deliver. I live a mile and a half away. Delivery is the main reason I want to order here,  to indulge in being a bum and having someone else make and deliver a pizza to me. Why is there never a delivery guy?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza place in Henderson.  My family has tried every pizza place in Henderson and will faithfully come back to only Bistro. Never disappointed with our food and they always have great customer service.  Our weekly tradition is coming here!"}
{"text":"So I thought I would try this pizza place, but when I called there was a poor connection because I live at the bottom of a valley. When I called back, I asked him if he could hear me now? He hung up on me! Then when I called back a third time, the phone just rang and rang like I was being ignored!! I guess I'll never know how your food is because you will never receive my business!! Poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Tucked away but well worth the find. It totally lives up to the yelpers reviews. Being an ex New Yorker that knows the pizza world choices, it is sensational. 
The staff are very friendly and playful. 
Smiles are abundant."}
{"text":"Been eating here since the day they opened. The pizza is consistently DELICIOUS. The wings I had recently were absolutely horrible, but I come here for the best pizza in Henderson."}
{"text":"The good reviews are true, folks.

I'm pretty picky about my pizza.  I was dubious about trying Bistro Pizza because the pizza place that used to exist in its spot was very \"meh\".  I know that's silly, but whatever.  Anyway, today I found myself without a vehicle and this place is right across the street, so I decided that today was the big day.

Now, I don't normally like calzones.  However, based on the good Yelp reviews, I went in with the notion that I would try a calzone or stromboli.  I got a calzone with ham, mozzarella, pineapple, onion, and roasted red pepper (it's a house special...don't remember the name).  WOW.  WOW is all that is needed... but for the sake of being complete, I'll give you a description.  The crust was light, flaky, and perfectly seasoned.  It was baked to absolute perfection.  My main complaint with calzones is that they're usually doughy and raw in spots (maybe I've had bad ones, but that's my experience).  Not this one.  It couldn't have been better.  The inside was filled with very fresh-tasting pineapple and other high-quality ingredients.  It came with a side of marinara, which was flavorful and pleasant.

The service was exceptional and the place was very clean.  The man making the pizzas looked like a real pizza chef rather than some greasy-looking skater punk like you might expect at a local pizza place.  Overall, Bistro Pizza gives the appearance of being a high-brow pizza place without the high cost.  The tables all have interesting books on them to read while you wait... a very cool touch.  My calzone was $10, which I consider to be very reasonable given that I'll get two meals out of it.  I was highly impressed with this place, and I'm glad there's something so delicious near my apartment now!

Try Bistro Pizza.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing garlic knots and delicious pizza. Takes me back to my high school days in the Bronx when I'd have a slice and knots almost every day after school. My husband ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was also super delicious. Add to that, the customer service here is second to none. As a born and bred New Yorker I give this place 5 stars and highly recommend for anyone looking for that authentic tasting NY style pizza. P.S. We came two days in a row while vacationing in Las Vegas. That's how good this place is!!"}
{"text":"This place has some seriously good food. I am very picky with Italian and this is great Pizza and subs. The guy who owns the place is the real deal and you can tell he has pride in his \"art\" of cooking.
 The prices are either low, reasonable or totally worth it. I am not much of a pizza fan, I like it but don't love it. ( again I have high standards so I just don't bother ordering most of the time unless everyone wants it...) and the pizza here is the best I have had in town.
 If we weren't trying to give up the white food and cut back on carbs so much we'd probably live in this place with the cheap lunches. The meatball subs are the bomb!
 It is the size of a standard sub shop with take out. Some booths and a round table. There are books to read while you wait. 
 Recommended."}
{"text":"I was in there during the Christmas break.  Owner was a nice guy and sat listened to my ramblings about my pizza propensities.  Crust was hardy and crisp.  Sauce was subtle and filling.  The cheese...great.  Atmosphere was a little lacking but hey what do you expect for a little joint like this.  Will definitely go back when visiting relatives."}
{"text":"Food still good. Complaint today I arrived after ordering and being told 40 min. Arrived early at around 30 minute was told still 40-50 minute wait. Some walk in customers told hour to hour and half wait. Guess it's popular and good but need to be better at timing. Also staff arguing behind counter."}
{"text":"We are from  out of town and loved it.  The fresh mozzarella really made it.  We had garlic knots, a side salad and pepperoni pizza.  It exceeded our expectations.  Very friendly staff and yummy food."}
{"text":"Went to Bistro pizza for the first time last week and I will definitely return. The pizza was great quality made to order, dough is hand tossed in the small prep area next to the dining room. Toppings were high quality and fresh. Great for families especially with kids. Tables have paper down for drawing with crayons and they have a selection of board games for while you wait/dine. Currently they have a check-in special for a free order of garlic knots with a purchase of large pizza. I was expecting a small side order but they provide you with their full order of knots which were great. The only thing I disliked is that the crust of the pizza was a little thick although it was cooked all the way through. I might see of they have a thin crust option next time. Overall great experience, good quality fresh pizza and good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"FAKE REVIEWS..........or the people of Vegas don't know their pizza. The pizza was bland at best. The crust was chewy. Round Table pizza is 100 times better. 

I came here because of the reviews and I was hoping to get some decent pizza, but I was wrong.

As soon as I walked in, I should have walked out. This place was filthy. The bathroom was filthy. There was dust all over. I should have known better that their pizza was going to be any good. 

They may have gotten me in the door, but I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, quickly made and the restaurant has a locally owned (which it is) flavor to it.  (pardon the pun)  Very comfortable place though we usually pick up the pizza and take it home.  Garlic knots are outstanding."}
{"text":"I ordered a small cheese pizza. 
I checked in on yelp and found a coupon for one (1) free garlic knot. Free food so I was excited but when I presented it to the guy, he said I have to order a large pizza to get it. Looking back at the coupon, yes indeed,  the coupon says so at the bottom. But hey, It's all about customer service, customer want to try a piece of it, with or without coupon you should just give it and make your customer happy. Your customer get to try it and hope they like it and buy a whole order. Well that's just my thinking. 
Pizza was good."}
{"text":"Great pizza, terrific salad (bistro deluxe- Wow!). Casual atmosphere, friendly service ....and great prices!! Family of five stuffed for $31. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so pizza is one of my \"things.\" I love it. I know the science behind good pizza. I've had pizzas all over the USA. 

I am the pizza man.

So I happened across this yelp page about three weeks ago and thought I would give it a chance. Everybody kept mentioning the garlic knots, and the place had a great score, so I thought, why not?

Anyway, since that day I've purchased at least 7 times from Bistro Pizza! I can't get enough!

THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN HENDERSON. 

Let's go over it in detail:

Dough: Obviously made from scratch. I can tell that each batch varies slightly in gluten development because some days the crust has been a little chewier or a little less chewy. The chef stretches the dough by hand - an absolute must to get the perfect pizza crust. The made-from-scratch dough is the BEST because you end up with that chewy, flavorful crust that makes ALL the difference. I'm assuming it's the same dough used in the garlic knots, which disappear like cocaine in a rehab facility.

Sauce: I'm not 100% this is home-made, but it sure tastes like it is. It is good. Not too strong and paste-y like pizza hut, not bland like so many other places. It has a great acidity and tomato flavor. If the pizza has a weak point it's the sauce, but if that's the weak point, it's not very weak at all.  

Toppings: Great toppings. Obviously there's a certain \"standard\" that every pizza place meets in what it uses for toppings, however, one thing I love about Bistro Pizza is that they don't skimp to save a few cents like many other places do. You can watch the chef make your pie and he isn't skimpy with the cheese or toppings. 

Price: just right. Very competitive prices and you get the highest quality pie in the area. 

Garlic knots, as I mentioned, are wonderful pizza-dough creations. For bread-lovers like me, they're perfect. 

Speed is great. It's not a factory like pizza hut or dominoes, obviously, but they compete time-wise. A lunch of a small pizza and soda could easily be had in a half hour."}
{"text":"Ohhhh-so-good! I'm in tonight with my almost nine year old. We ordered garlic knots (garlicky, hot, & delicious) and a medium pizza. We only finished half of what we ordered, but we enjoyed every single bite!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and people! The vibe and energy is awesome which makes for excellent food!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken fingers and salads this time. We always get the pizza but now I know everything here is delicious."}
{"text":"After spending the day cleaning, scrubbing, polishing, mopping and vacuuming my house I wanted something yummy. No burgers, no pizza, no wings. I was craving garlic knots and a declicious caesar salad. If I was going to feel guilty about eating carbohydrates, it was gonna be worth it. I had left overs the next day, and I love how the knots hold up after reheating. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Third time visiting and just like the first...outstanding!!! I wasn't happy the last time I visited but this time it was awesome! I picked up rather than deliver and everything hot and fresh.  Also, management posted to my yelp review to make up for the low satisfaction. They certainly made it up! Gave me a free appetizer. This is the small town feel pizza joint my family was looking for.

I had just got off duty and still in uniform, someone picked up my tab without even me knowing! I totally didn't expect that but I really appreciated it! Nice to know our efforts are still appreciated.

We will definitely continue going to Bistro."}
{"text":"We get pizza from Bistro at least twice a month (sometimes more!). Pizza is outstanding, garlic knots are delicious, and the service is great! Chris is my favorite guy there. Whether it's football or game of thrones, we always end up chatting about something while my pizza gets done cooking. 5 stars!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon for Bistro and had seen it in the shopping center a few times so we decided to go for it.  

First, the service is excellent!  We realized right before ordering that this coupon (free garlic knots with pizza) was expired.  My husband told the owner (I think) on the phone and he was happy to throw in the garlic knots.  Well who has two thumbs and is a total space cadet?!? THIS GIRL (points to self with thumbs, you get the idea).  I left the coupon at home :(  He was totally cool about it and gave them to us anyway.  We promised to bring him two expired coupons next time, LOL.  

The food was terrific.  There are a few obsessive questions that every NY'er asks him or herself about pizza to determine if it meets the high pizza standards we uphold: Is the sauce-to-cheese ratio good?  Is it a decently thin crust?  Can I fold it over without completely and utterly destroying it?  Are the crust and sauce awesome?  The answer is unequivocally YES to all of these questions.  Not only did I totally love the pizza but the garlic knots were delightful.  Perfect amount of garlic and soft yet with a slight crunch.  I was so pleased.  

The interior has some booths and tables that you can dine in at.  I especially liked looking at the kiddos' drawings that were hung on the side of the counter.  There were some pretty good ones too! haha, better than anything I could come up with! 

This will be our go-to local pizza place!"}
{"text":"Whoever's idea it was to make meatball sliders out of garlic knots is a genius! Good pizza, garlic knots and service at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the pizza yet lol but the pasta entrees are bomb!! You get a large plate of food, bread (garlic knots), and a salad! I either eat it in 2 meals or share!! Delicious and affordable when you need a warm plate of comfort food. 

FYI they put tomato slices in the fettuccine. I LOVE it but some people might not"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and seen the reviews on yelp.  Let me just say it's got to be the best pizza and garlic knots in the valley.

I thought Metro pizza was good but this place blows them out of the water.  You have to come and try this place it will exceed your expectations.

The staff was amazing and so nice.  I can't wait to come back and bring more friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. It was just normal pizza. I wanted to try the garlic knots  but when I mentioned the free knots with a yelp check in I was told I needed to buy a large pizza (I was buying a medium) if I wanted the free knots. When I agreed to buy the large they said they were out, yet, they continued to sell garlic knots to everyone who came in after me. Not a big deal, but over all the pizza was basic smaller than average size slices."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good.  I didn't think at first there was enough meat on the pie.  I mentioned it to the owner making it and he added more without question.  It was a great experience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite restaurant! The Chicken Parm sliders are amazing and they are all really cool people l! Just moved to the area and I'm glad I stopped by to check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is great Stromboli and pizza and the bistro fries are great also definitely recommend this place great friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"We just had our first pizza from here, nothing fancy, just a cheese pizza.  Oh my goodness it was delicious & so were the garlic knots with marina. We didn't know we had such a great place so close to us.  We will definitely order from here again & since we know it is also a dine in restaurant we will be dining, not just doing take - out.  Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I called to place the order, spoke with a nice young man. Ordered a cheese
pizza with extra cheese! So delicious! There is really no reason for any additional toppings or condiments, the pizza stands alone! The sauce is noticeably homemade which is nice considering that many pizza places use a generic sauce. Also ordered garlic knots! So soft, buttery, garlicky, and heavenly!! Definitely one of my favorites! I picked up and the people there were extremely nice! Will be ordering a lot more often!!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the crust. Pizzas tasted ok. Nothing special. Theme of having something to draw on the table was nice."}
{"text":"I'll start with this. I've never eaten here. The food may be heavenly but I'll never know. 

I've seen previous reviews that mention the owner not being there and the employees being less than inviting. 

So did I mention that I've never eaten here? Here's why. 

I called and asked about delivery services. Can't deliver until 430pm. Fair enough. I am willing to pickup. After telling me they can't deliver, I'm immediately put on hold. I wait for a couple of minutes. Two maybe. I get a man on the phone that states in a \"were slammed and I don't want to answer the phone\" type tone and asks \"what can I do for you?\" What??? I say I'd like to place an order. His response \"I said what can I do for you\". Ok. Not exactly a friendly greeting but I'll roll with it. 

I begin to place my order and I'm put back on hold with no warning. I hung the phone up and I'm sure I won't be calling back. 

If the owner reads this, that's how you lose business in under 4 minutes. I hope you get this issue resolved before it really starts affecting more potential customers. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Boulder City and this is on the way home when we go to Henderson for shopping. We have tried the pizza in Boulder City and keep coming for this pizza."}
{"text":"Is this place ever open?

On December 27th stopped by for lunch and there was a note on the door saying they were closed for Christmas ant they would reopen on the 28th. On the 28th around one in the afternoon I called their number and the phone just rang and rang with no answer. Again on January 3rd at about two in the afternoon we stopped by to have lunch and they were still not open. I read the great reviews on how delicious the pizza is at this place and I have now attempted 3 times to try it. My question again is, are they ever open?"}
{"text":"I have an extremely picky crew of three children and a husband. Everyone was happy with the pizza here.  The crust was great and the sauce was perfect. We were in town for a few days and were looking for a simple non - fussy place for our family to eat and relax. The coloring paper was great for my kids. The service was good too, but they were pretty busy with a takeout crowd as well."}
{"text":"A great little eatery stashed away behind the stores... very good food and great service by friendly staff... sometimes the wait can be a bit long (but it is well worth it)... I've had pizza and pasta too... they even have gluten free pizza for my friend!! So we meet there for an early lunch."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place.  Everything we've tried has been great.  Their pizza is tasty and the fries are addicting."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Henderson and Vegas. The service is phenomenal and personal, the pizza is of excellent quality. It is a little pricey but check out their website for daily specials. Worth it"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome!  Great price!  Great service!  My daughter had the chicken Parmesan which, was really good for the price!  We loved the low-key vibe!!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots and fries are amazing! The service was awesome as well. We definitely found a new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Great lunch, the garlic knots are awsome."}
{"text":"Best take out pizza in Henderson!  We've attempted Enzos, Super pizza and a couple delivery joints that were just eww.  Bistro is so good even if they don't deliver to my hood.  Always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is the reason \"bang for your buck\" was invented as a slogan. For ~ 10$, you get an entree, a side salad, AND a side order of garlic knots. The garlic knots are cooked to cheesy-garlicy-PERFECTION right before your eyes. 

If you want Americanized-Italian food... This isn't the place to go. If you want a little hole in the wall that is straight out of Sicily, this is your place. 

One of my favorite things about this experience was the \"family\" environment the staff at with one another. They were joking, laughing, smiling, not only with their guests but with each other. It really added to my experience knowing that they WANTED to be there, not just forced too.

If you want great home style affordable Italian food without the artificial glam of the Vegas strip -- say hello to your new Italian family!"}
{"text":"I'm not a yelper. Which is funny because I am so opionated; additionally, I'm always out and about trying everything once. Nonetheless, sometimes, just sometimes, I feel compelled to write a review.

Today is one of those times.

I love Bistro Pizza. It's simple, it's descent and it's close to home. 

Let me break down my rating which is more a 3.5 than a 4:


Food- Their pizza is descent. It's not the best but it will do. That being said.... The pizza sauce is good. Generally speaking, the ingredients used, across the board, are quality. There's room for improvement with their knots, house fries and chicken wings/fingers - they are handled with a sense of obligation in that they really only serve them because they are a pizza joint and it's expected. However, their pasta dishes are legit. Delicious for the most part. Seriously eat the pasta. Especially if it's a daily special. 

Service- I am guessing they are under new mgmt. The last two times I've been here the only owner known to me (the Alton Brown look alike) hasn't been there. Seems odd since I've never not seen him there in the past years+. Anyhow, the guy who I am assuming is Tyler (dark goatee in a ball cap) appears to be the new owner or manager. He knows his customers well and treats everyone like guests in his home. He's definitely got a lock on how to run the \"kitchen\" and you can tell he cares about his employees because you can hear him giving kudos left and right. 

That being said... It's got a rather fraternal feel to it now. It's like if your older, cooler brother invited a few friends over and was like \"Dude let's cook stuff and sell it\" and they agreed. So service is spotty if you're eating in and Tyler isn't up front. Also, if you're dining in, don't be surprised if you have to ask for stuff multiple times and inquire about the rest of your order if they get busy while you are there. It can get a little tense when you can see (and hear) all that's going on.  
We just left the restaurant about an hour ago. And I can't close this review out without bringing up Lavelle (sp?) I believe another reviewer mentioned him a few reviews ago. He is the reason for my review ultimately. He could probably run the bistro by himself. 

During our dinner I can't count how many times I heard the manager or another employee bellowing for his assistance. And everytime there he was whisking from one task to the next without hesitation. Despite his workload I saw him go out of his way to keep an eye on the diners and their needs. Our table included. I really hope he is shown the appreciation he is due.  

So...long review short. Good place. Give it a try. I keep going back and likely will again.

Ps. It's always hot in there regardless of the season but you get use to it."}
{"text":"We decided to get a pizza for National Pizza Day...I was less excited than my fam because we had pizza at work today...

...I felt like non commercial pizza hence picking this place...

Ohhhhhhhemmmm goodness I'm so glad I did! Our order was: smothered fries, mozzarella sticks (I had already had pizza day didn't feel like anymore), and what I thought was going to be a pepperoni stuffed crust pizza on hand tossed crust...

...NOPE!!! It was this fully loaded, cheesy, pizza pie stuffed full of oozy goozy greatness!!!

Needless to say...I forgot about the smothered fries and mozzarella sticks...I tried to get a picture before a few pieces were stolen LOL

I will be back!! This place is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Best wings by far! Even better than Buffalo Wild Wings... 
Awesome pizza as well! Thanks Yelp for the suggestion!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their dough is freshly made every day and his sauce is to die for! He has a great menu. Even his salads are amazing. A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Bistro offers a $10 large 1 topping pizza to students and employees at my school, so I decided to give it a try.  We got a pineapple pizza and it was good, but nothing special. We also got the garlic knots, which I liked more than the pizza. It's hard to go wrong with soft bread covered in garlic and butter! Overall, the food here is 3/5 stars. 

Service here however is 5 stars. Our pizza was promptly brought to our table, and even though it's not really waiter service here, the guy who delivered our pizza refilled our drinks and brought us waters. He was also very quick to bring a little cup of ranch to my friend. 

I'll be back in the future, but mostly due to the good deal from my school."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and very friendly service! Pizza crust was crispy and overall taste was very flavourful. The garlic knots are amazing and for only $5, totally worth it!! It was nice that they had board games for the kids to play, a definite plus as an alternative to iPads. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Great service and really delicious pizza! This place is a little gem in the city of Henderson."}
{"text":"I'm increasing to 3 stars because of the customer service and concern for our good will. I will be back to try the pizza soon."}
{"text":"Came in today based on reviews staff are very friendly place nice and clean . Tried different pizzas around Henderson this is the spot. No need to going anywhere else thanks Yelpers for this place !!!"}
{"text":"I have known Tyler for a couple of years thru a mutual friend. As a new resident to Henderson (lived in Las Vegas for 16 years) I can say without a doubt that he has the best pizza in the valley. Montesano's, Verranzo's you are officially put on notice. His crust is better, his pizza is the best I've had in Vegas in the last decade. I grew up in the Hudson Valley of New York (the epicenter for Pizza) and I honestly say that you need to support Tyler. It's not everyday an entrepreneur provides a superior product and delivers it at a great price. Everyday you settle for Domino's, Pizza-hut, or Papa John's you are cheating yourself. Tyler has the experience and it shows in his end product. This place is an absolute gem and us Henderson residents need to get the word out. I'm in for a pizza a week til' I croak."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Always our go to when we're in the mood for pizza. The staff is extremely friendly and make you feel right at home. The owner is very friendly and accommodating.  They even added some salad specials and daily specials. Garlic knots are fantastic and a must get every visit :)"}
{"text":"We pulled into las vegas today,  and were hungry but lazy.  After looking on Yelp,  we saw they delivered.  Perfect! 

Waiting on the lobby of the hotel,  the delivery guy walked in and kept pulling out bags of food.  With the third bag being set on the couch,  we thought it wasn't our order.  But turned out it was all ours. Great food! 

Mlm I had the lasagna it was yummy!  The garlic rolls were good. The entrees come with salads and rolls, lots of yummy food for the money!   So be careful when ordering to go. Husband got the Tuscan and it was delicious also.  Great spot and super convenient."}
{"text":"First time, found them here on Yelp. Glad we tried, it was so good! Little spot on Gibson and worth the drive. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Whenever my family and I want pizza this is where we go! You must try the meatball sliders! One of my faves."}
{"text":"Thanks Tyler for urging me to give it one more shot....Poutine was awesome!!! My daughter took one taste and said \"OMG Daddy ....I am a huge fan of this!!!\" And the pizza was friggen great to!!  I posted a pic of the poutine...weird name for something so delicious lol..Thanks again Tyler....you guys will be a pit stop every time I am down that way!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I have found a great local pizza place. Bistro is located on Gibson just south of the 215. If you check in on Yelp you get a FREE order of garlic knots, very generous. The garlic knots are really good, perfect blend of cheese and garlic and cooked perfectly until just done. 

We ordered a large sausage, mushroom and peppers. The toppings and cheese were plentiful and all tasted high quality. The crust was really good, thin and crispy. Definately one of the better pizza's I have had in Vegas. Bistro also has a full italian menu and a nice sit down area if you choose to dine in. The meatball sliders look awesome, will have to try on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I came here a while ago and had 'The Thaddius' stromboli...it was so good I decided I had to try the pizza! I noticed that with a Yelp check in between 2-5pm, you get 50% off a pizza! I called in my order around 4pm: large pizza - half sausage and black olives, half pineapple and ham...15 minutes later I picked it up, and it was ready and waiting for me! They charge a flat rate for the pizza ($15 for large) and then charge for each topping seperately ($1.75/topping for large). I liked that since I did a half and half pizza, they only charged me half price for all my toppings rather than the full amount! In total, with the 50% off, it came out to $10 + tip...that's cheaper than most of the chains and this pizza put all the others in this area to shame!

Ok, let's talk about the pizza...thin crust that was crispy, yet not too crispy, and sauce that was out of this world...tasted like tomatoes and complimented the toppings perfectly. The thing that made this pizza so good was the quality of the ingredients used. The crust is made in house, the sauce tasted homemade, and the toppings are top notch. I had sausage on half of my pizza and there was no grease to blot up...like I said, high quality! There was a lot of cheese, which I liked, but if you prefer a pizza with a little less cheese, I'm sure they'd do it if you asked. I felt like the crust, sauce, topping ratio was perfect...thin crust, lots of toppings!

You can tell that Tyler, the owner and chef, takes pride in his work...when you're craving pizza support this local business and give it a try...you will more than likely question why you hadn't gone in sooner!"}
{"text":"Was not told my salad was extra charge, poor employee work practice. Olive garden did that before and lost my business over it.

Had the chicken parm dinner. Lots of pasta, chicken was not breaded and a little on small side but overall was average. The sauce was very light but had a good taste to it.

Wife had a small pepperoni pizza and she loved it. I had a bite and wished I got that over my meal.

Overall with how nice the staff was, joking with us I would give it a 3.5 to a 4. Might not be back for sometime if I ever go back though."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium with ricotta and red peppers. Simple but so delicious. The garlic knots could have been a little softer and have some more flavor as well as the crust of the pizza. But overall it was a great dinner. Usually pizza makes me feel greasy and gross inside but this one didn't. (And makes a good breakfast!)"}
{"text":"The stuffed pizza, salads & garlic knots were delicious! We will definitely eat there again whenever we're in town.

9/26/15 The food is still great, but the service is pathetic. Our salad has already been prepared & the manager or someone that was over seeing things took toppings off our salad before giving it to us because apparently the person that made it had been a little too generous. Come on- that's just tacky & rude. Down one star to 4."}
{"text":"Tried this pizzeria for the first time yesterday and thought it was great.  Will definitely go back.  Metro is very good but I think Bistro is a much better value and delicious."}
