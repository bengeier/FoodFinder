{"text":"Yuck food is greasy service stunk! I ordered a Philly sand which to find out they were out! Ordered French onion soup was way too salty. Mozzarella sticks ok but defiantly greasy! Waited 20 minutes for our check as we were told our server was busy. Needs a good cleaning also"}
{"text":"I went there for a quick breakfast. It wasn't crowded, so I was seated quickly. I ordered an espresso with egg Benedictines, as it came with potatoes and I wasn't in the mood for any, I asked that it be replaced with fruits... The waitress came back with two little slices of melon, orange and grapefruit. I was really unhappy to pay 18$ for two slices of fruits and tasteless Benedictines, I don't usually say this but the food wasn't good at all and my overall experience either... I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure of mine.

I go here for my cheap burger fix, that occasional craving your get when your stomach wants anything BUT \"gourmet\" or \"fancy\".

It does the trick.

No frills, no thrills, and the bathrooms are pretty scary, but I still find myself here every so often to munch down the 'classic'.

{"text":"It was my first time in Canada, and my boyfriend and I opted to eat at a place with American food. We found this restaurant as we were walking around Montreal. The food was good, reasonally priced, and came on big plates. Neither of us could finish our food. The rock and roll atmosphere was nice. Try the desserts!"}
