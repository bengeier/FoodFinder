{"text":"Rustic is my favourite bagel breakfast spot! Especially in the summer sitting out on the patio with a Caesar and delicious breakfast.  Always great service , food always good."}
{"text":"Pretty average breakfast/brunch spot in Parkdale with a gorgeous interior!   We live close by and I had been meaning to check this spot out for awhile. Seems like a bit of a hidden gem, we got a booth right away on a Saturday around noon for brunch. The building is beautiful inside, big windows, and a high tin ceiling.   Husband had the eggs benedict and enjoyed it, said it was pretty standard (he is very partial to the benny at the Drake). I had the roasted veggie and goat cheese omlette. I thought it was very good, eggs were nicely cooked and they didn't skimp on the chevre. Both meals came with home fries and mine also had toast (choice of rye, multigrain, brown or white).   I thought the prices were more than fair and the service was friendly. I'd go back but it's nothing very special, especially in an area swarming with brunch spots."}
{"text":"Had brunch here around 11am on a sunny Saturday. No wait for a table that day. Our server was very friendly and attentive.   I was debating over which of the eggs benny toppings to get and my server informed me I could have two different kinds - pretty much the highlight of my whole weekend. When they arrived they were delicious. My brunch companion order the pancakes which he loved, but they had a strong cinnamon flavor and cinnamon powder sprinkled on top. He enjoyed them very much, but if you are not a cinnamon fan, I would order something else. The portions were healthy sizes for the price.   Atmosphere was relaxed, comfortable and casual. Some dinners were hanging out and reading, others were there with families. Looked like a welcoming spot for all.   There was a counter full of baked goods that also caught my eye, although I didn't end up ordering anything to take home.   I would happily go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, best staff, great work space. But no plugs, and they close at 4! Always disappointed that these two things consistently shorten my stay here. Recommended for a delicious brunch, though!"}
{"text":"Cute little joint, average fare. Good for breakfasts and brunches. It's tasty and to the point, although that's just it. Basic. Nevertheless, would happily eat again."}
{"text":"I was there about three weeks ago with my farther.  The inside is really nice and has a \"rustic\" feeling which I liked.  Almost left like a old time salon.    He had the brew coffee while I had  a latte.  My father never complains and he found the brewed coffee not tasty at all.    I ordered a latte and when it arrives it was more like a cappuccino  Not only was it not a latte the milk was burnt.    My father ordered a BLT bagel and he only ate half.  He was not impressed.    Alright service. Nice setting. Poor coffee."}
{"text":"Beautiful antique ambiance, amazing coffee and great brunch - homemade iced fruit teas that are worthy of the five stars alone. The most outstanding part about Rustic is the wonderful people who work there - Nicole handles the crowds with grace and humor that keeps the wheels turning and the people coming back for more."}
{"text":"This was hands-down the best breakfast I've ever had. Everything was delicious. Even the bread was so amazing that I wished they sold it in loaves. The only down side is you might wait a few minutes for a table on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is located in Parkdale just west of Dufferin on Queen. It's our fave lunch spot with their homemade lemonade and chicken/Brie wrap. We also frequent the Cosmo for brunch on a Saturday morning for their breakfast bagels or egg platter. (My parents brought breakfast bagels to the hospital when my son was born. Such a nice treat)."}
{"text":"Rustic Cosmo, predating the current wave of gentrification in the area as prompted by the Drake Nexus, has been a Parkdale fixture since the 90's.  Back in them days, as the old timers tell it, Queen Street west of Dufferin was a dangerous, untamed Killzone where newly arrived immigrants bravely eked out a perilous living amongst mutant crack babies, retired Mossad agents, roti fetishists, granola, design students and worst of all, artists.  Thankfully, those days are gone and a golden era of condo dwellers approaches.  However, for those who want to viscerally experience a real connection to the past, Rustic Cosmo awaits.    Firstly, the décor has not changed in years.  I have a vivid memory of eating brunch there one day around 2004 and realizing that the walls were painted with the exact same vivid purple we had just painted over in our new place.  Only took two primer coats and three more of the light buttery yellow paint before that gruesomeness was banished.  Having said that, I want to make it clear that in the Rustic, either the purple works or I'm so used to it I can no longer tell if it doesn't.  Other features from late 80s, early 90s?  Wood booths, de rigueur exposed brick and pressed tin ceiling.  For reasons like that memory, I can't really judge Rustic like I would other places.  It's a neighbourhood spot, serving faithfully for many years.  It's the default brunch spot where I could probably stroll in wearing my pj pants and not get a second look.    Food wise, they knock out their dishes with admirable consistency.  Basic menu is a collection of bagel sandwiches and various breakfast options.  Most plates come with a house mesclun mix salad with a balsamic heavy dressing.  With breakfast options you also get home fries.  Their home fries are just ok, with precooked potatoes briefly sautéed with what looks like a grainy mustard.  For the record, I prefer my homefries to be a varying mass of crisp edges and soft creamy potato.  Sunday is best for brunch, when they add a pretty decent eggs benny option to the menu.    The all-important coffee?  Drip varies in quality (though it has been richer lately) and espresso based drinks are just \"meh\".  This despite the impressive eagle topped espresso machine.  Toronto has gone through several coffee revolutions since Rustic opened and they are now being judged by a much higher standard.  Service over the years has ranged from stellar to addled.  However, I'd like to stress that without fail, servers are friendly and attitude free.  I'll forgive the occasional lapse if their hearts are in the right place.  In summary, if you find yourself in the nabe, it's worth a visit.  Don't expect fireworks, but don't be surprised if you enjoy the place.   My rating reflects the warm fuzzies that live in my heart for Rustic."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time! Mimosa special 2 for $10 are amazing, and are 500ml each -they are literally HUGE! I had an omelet ( made from scratch with no dairy = happy me). It was light, fluffy and full of flavour, comes with home fries or salad & 3 pieces of toast. And my bf  had their breakfast special with all the fixings - which also was absolutely delicious!  They have old school Italian espresso machine and oh boy was it ever good  Highly recommend as a solid brunch place in Parkdale."}
{"text":"Rustic Cosmo Cafe is a long-time Parkdale staple. I had breakfast there on Friday with a few friends and we all agreed that it was pretty...average.  Some pros...Rustic room, nice location, good coffee and some serious street cred. This place has been around since before the 1% began their attempt at gentrifying the area.   The food arrived to our table quickly. We ended up getting a few different dishes and sharing: the Roasted Veggies and Goat Cheese Omelet, the Brunch Burrito with Bacon and Yogurt Parfait. The eggs, bacon and home fries were well presented and prepared. The ingredients were fresh and the seasonings were tasty and balanced.   Some cons...They can't do poached eggs. They offer absolutely no substitutions to their menu, which for people with food allergies and dietary restrictions is a complete turn-off. Also, the toast was akin to thick, tasteless wonderbread and our server was inattentive.  We may have overstayed our welcome at the Rustic Cosmo, due to the room being so cozy and outside being quite chilly. It's easy to get trapped in the throes of good conversation, ok coffee and...average...breakfast."}
{"text":"Rustic Cosmo Cafe is located in my neighbourhood and I often go there for brunch. Strictly speaking, this is not a post-hangover brunch place (meaning they do not serve greasy diner food) and they open quite late for my standards (10 am or so) but every time I have a craving for pancakes and I know I am not going to get them at home, I go to this restaurant.  RCC serves tasty brunch fare - a variety of sandwiches, bagels, wraps, eggs and pancakes. If you are very hungry, may I suggest the Cowboy breakfast which has everything you could possibly get?  If I go with someone, we usually split a savuory dish or two and then order pancakes.  The place is quite busy on weekends and staff will not make substitutions. They do not have soya milk, real maple syrup or proper bread - all minor things but hold me from giving them five stars.  cheers, Priyank (http://finaltransit.com/)"}
{"text":"Lovely, cosy little place, friendly staff but...I'm afraid to say, very ordinary coffee. Bitter and flavourless and weak. For a cafe that specializes in coffee, that's pretty darn slack."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their cappuccino. It is too frothy with not enough milk, and far too bitter for my liking. It has also burned my tongue badly on one occasion."}
{"text":"Went to the rustic cosmo today for a quick brunch but it couldnt have been more of the contrary. We got in at 1pm and didnt get out until 3.   Firstly, there was no acknowledgement at the door. We waited at least 5 minutes before the server said a table would be ready in another 5 minutes. This wasnt a lack of table space but moreover the server being unable to focus on a single task at hand.   There was 3 of us and we got our orders in shortly after being seated. We waited an hour and 15 minutes before getting 3 breakfasts served; Eggs cosmo, Cowboy breakfast, and a bagel.   While we were waiting, we had cigarette breaks and upon asking for more coffee, we were forgotten. The server had began another task of serving someone else before getting our coffees.   The only redeeming quality of this experience was the actual end product.   Upom paying our bill at 3pm, the lady at the counter asked me how our breakfast was and i told her it was okay but it was a really long wait. I was met with no response. Im not the type to leave without tipping and i did so anyways. However, i really feel that i shouldnt have.   For 3 breakfasts, it ran me 2 hours and $60. For the amount of effort and time it takes me to earn that, i wouldnt say this place deserves any of my money.   Its unfortunate we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happening to this once cherished brunch spot. We used to go a lot and hadn't been a while. We went a couple of weeks ago and the breakfast was amiss. We went again today and as usual ordered very crispy bacon and over medium eggs. Both were undercooked. We thought it an anomaly the last time but today again?? And what is with the god awful garlic salt on what used to be some of the best home fries in town, and to top, why are the potatoes cold?!!!! Epic fail, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Eggs Cosmo were really good. And it's possible to order beer, quite an important detail!"}
{"text":"Neat little place, if youre in the neighbourhood. Cozy, if a little outdated atmosphere. But retro is hip now, right?    The menu makes me so happy. I strolled in for the first time, hoping for something that resembled a sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised to find there are a bunch of different sandwiches and bagel sandwiches on the menu with fresh ingredients, and they are DELICIOUS. It is apparent that things are homemade, and there are a lot of ingredients you wouldnt find on the menu at your average coffee shop. Think avocado, aoli, and like 6 different kinds of cheese. I was impressed to note that they have a quiche of the day, and the folks working were discussing what kind to make for tomorrow. I have not tried it, but may have to now. As other reviewers have noted, the coffee is not spectacular --but it still beats Tim Hortons.  The staff were pleasant, and seemed to know many of the people riding the tail end of the lunch rush. I dont know if I would go for a sit-down meal, at least not with great expectations. Actually, I would say in general, that as long as you dont arrive with great expectations, its a pleasant surprise in a hit-and-miss neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Rustic Breakfast and the small back patio. The portions were very generous, so you better be hungry. Otherwise, the bagel may be a better choice. My gfs Eggs Benedict was good too. She preferred the avacado over the spinach. My only complaint would be the lack of shade on the patio and that some college kids at the table next to us were smoking."}
{"text":"Dropped into here for a greasy breakfast.  The space is pretty cool and the staff are very friendly.  I ordered a bacon and egg breakfast with whole wheat bread and home fries.  This might be my favourite bacon and egg breakfast on Queen in WQW.  The bacon and eggs were cooked really well.  The bread was tasty and the homefries...have cheese in them!  The price is right and the food is solid."}
{"text":"We used to think this was a great spot for lunch and coffee on the way to work, but its collection of quirks begins to wear thin after awhile.  They don't open until 9am, which isn't ideal for the morning crowd. Their muffins and bagels are good, but you could do better for coffee right across the street.  The staff is friendly and the wait typically isn't long.  They have good sandwiches for lunch, but the quality tends to be uneven. The prime rib quality ranges from great to pretty bad.  They also frequently run out of lunch items by 1pm and muffins by 9:45am. Make more stuff guys!"}
{"text":"Located just inside of Parkdale, this was a pleasant surprise to have breakfast at recently. We arrived shortly before the Sunday morning brunch rush and were able to easily get a table the minute we walked in - I understand this can get more difficult in Toronto with popular brunch spots on Sundays. That said, given my experience, I'm surprised the review count is so low for Rustic.  Here is the quick and dirty  - Staff: Friendly, attentive and took very good care of us. Our coffee/teas never went below the 1/2 cup mark without a refill - Location: Easily accessible from Liberty Village and via the King Street car - Food:  #1 - I had the Eggs Benedict with Pemale. Eggs were cooked perfect, eggs were an exact over easy and bacon was a nice thick cut. The potatoes and side salad were excellent as well. Only gaff was the hollandaise was a little light, in that it was sparsely added, but over all a great dish!  #2 - I heard a lot about their pancakes and ordered a single one on the side (just to try). and I couldn't be sure but it was a nicer texture than buttermilk, I feel like it might have been buckwheat AND was dusted lightly with cinnamon. Aces! I could've eaten a stack of these no problems!  Give this place a visit and some local love if you're in the Liberty Village/Parkdale area, great breakkie/brunch spot!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Where the Yelp! app shines is finding a perfect spot while out and about and this time it struck gold for me. Rustic Cosmo Cafe is a coffee shop like Fort Knox is a bank. Lined in rich wood paneling and with festooned with the classic Toronto tin ceiling, this cute hole-in-the-wall brims with all that Parkdale-cool stands for. They make a delicious latte as well as hot chocolate and all the sweets are made in house. While I was waiting for my beverage, the allure of the wall menu drew me in and I ordered a bagel with peameal bacon and cheese. Tasty!  The old style booths are a quaint touch and the vintage upright piano against the wall exudes quintessential charm reminiscent of Queen Street stalwarts like the Cameron or Kensington's Graffiti's. Think of how many coffee shops you would go out of your way for. This is one of those."}
{"text":"Love this little nook in Parkdale!  I don't know what they put into the breakfast bagels here but it must be magic. If I am ever in the area and I have time I always stop in to get the Cowgirl aka the best bagel ever. How can you go wrong with Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, Cheddar and Garlic Aoli? That's right you can't.   I've always gotten my food to go but next time I'm going to try one of their bigger meal-type breakfasts and sit inside. It has a really cute cozy vibe and everyone there is really friendly.  Also they have a patio for the warmer summer months so yay for that!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot I found while visiting Toronto. I also ate at the Drake and Gladstone.  Rustic Cosmo has a robust breakfast menu including vegan options! I had a tofu scramble with home fries and it was delicious. Good coffee and service too.   If you're in the area this is hands down the place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just west of Dufferin, on Queen, in what used to be Parkdale, sits a lovely little gem - Rustic Cosmo Cafe.  Nice little booth seating along the left, warm coloured woods, an open kitchen/cash area, a nice sized patio out back, this place has everything I'd want it to have.  Warm vibes, comfort food and great coffee.  After a couple of visits, I found the servers (although SUPER nice) to be a bit forgetful.  Forgot the coffee, forgot the sugar, no cutlery... that sort of thing.  It happened on two separate visits, but I'll still go back.  Like I said, they're SUPER nice.  The brunch is medium, the sandwiches are better.  There are a ton of menu items including quite a few veggie options.  There's definitely something for everyone here.  The prices are at the higher end of average for the meal sizes.  I really should give Rustic 3 stars, but there's a little something about it that makes me go back time and again.  Whether it's just for a coffee, or a full meal, Rustic Cosmo Cafe has a put little spell on me."}
{"text":"This place is a decent find for the brunch spots in this neighborhood. Wanting to avoid the ridiculous waits despite sub bar food decided to try this spot out on a whim. We went in early so it was quite easy to get a seat. The place is cozy and the staff is friendly which is a good thing to have in the declining service trend.  I ordered pancakes and my DC ordered the eggs Benedict with a side of french toast.  Our food was brought over promptly and thankfully the pancakes had real maple syrup served along side. Pancakes are very average and nothing to write home about.  I did try the eggs benny and was pleasantly surprised. Good hollandaise and eggs poached just right. The side of potatoes was flavored well too. I didn't try the french toast but the DC commented it was decent as well. Good place to visit IMO if you like eggs benny and want to get far away from the maddening crowd."}
{"text":"Food is food, bagels are delicious but the service is always brutal. Seems like they have a high turn over so maybe the management or owner is a nightmare to work for and can't keep staff? Not sure but over the years of going here I've never had the same server twice and the servers just don't have common server sense. I'm sure serving brunch isn't ideal but they could make it better on themselves. Food is good and consistent. Not sure why jam is $2. It's good jam but could be a nice cherry on top of a $10 breaky."}
{"text":"What a gem! I love this place for all it's charm! Tucked right inside where parkdale begins this place is definitely worth popping in! It's such a cute interior and completely cozy, that being said on the weekends I can see it getting packed fast. The food was deeelicious but relatively small portions so order up! It was a really great deal for all the food we for just duely note on slow days, service is very \"chill\" so oh may need to take a little initiate w things like refills, bills, etc. but everyone who works here is super nice and sweet it feels like your wrong breaky at home! I'll definitely be coming here on the reg now."}
{"text":"I had a great time here just before Christmas. The home fries were terrific and so was my bacon . It has a great little atmosphere and is a lovely place to go to in the mornings. My  waitress was super nice. I had a lovely breakfast when I went. The only thing is I asked for rye bread and I got white bread Instead but it wasn't a big problem as her friendly disposition was so welcoming."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent...when you know they finally bring it to your table.   They have a packed kitchen every weekend but have one or two guys making all the food. Yeah I feel sorry for that guy. As well as all the coffee and bagel orders from walk ins. I've often been served cold food as by the time the last item on the plate has been finished it's cold.   If they could fix the line problem...it would be so much better. Service is pretty good considering."}
{"text":"The breakfast is mediocre at best, and it's like the staff is annoyed by you being there. I'm not sure how this place still exists in a prime spot on Queen. Like, tear it down and put in another McDonald's."}
{"text":"A really great breakfast place. Very unassuming when you walk past but always a great decision to go in and get a seat. Staff are always friendly and attentive (which can be hard to find in hipster queen west). The classic breakfast is good but the real star of the show is the eggs Benedict which is amazing and come in a variety of options and even allow you to mix and match! Also a great place to grab a afternoon coffee, a snack and just relax."}
{"text":"Initially wanted to visit School on a weekend morning but the lineup was too long, and thus Yelped the next available brunch spot nearby. Rustic Cosmo Cafe popped up and we were not disappointed.   I'm an eggs benny fan and you can choose different eggs benny for your one order. For example, one order comes with two eggs bennies and you can choose different types for each. It's a foodie's dream come true to have more options in one sitting!  Rustic decor, chill atmosphere, and friendly customer service. It's a bit out of the way for me, but I'd definitely come again if in the area."}
{"text":"Got the cowboy breakfast . Really good, tasty and worth it. Service was really good as well."}
{"text":"It looked quaint from the outside so we stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon. It was freezing out and the door next to our table was wide open but the server had to \"check with management\" before he could close it for us. Strike one.  The service was OK. We specified that we had be in and out within 45 minutes and our server practically rolled his eyes because he was so sure that that was plenty of time. 45 minutes later, we were still waiting for our food. My friends got their stuff to go and returned to work. I ate solo.   The food itself was less than spectacular. The cheese in the french onion soup was barely melted when it got to the table and the home fries were bland. The pulled pork was dripping in red sauce and didn't look very appetizing to me. Finally, there were flies zooming around the whole time. You get what you pay for.  Maybe I should just stick to the coffee in this cafe."}
{"text":"I don't generally give out 5 stars. I've been here a few times before and had always had a good experience. Today was extra special.  Not only was the food and service great. But my friend was not feeling well, and the staff went above and beyond to help us out in the situation that we had.   I truly appreciate what they did for us.  Thanks so much.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Rustic Cosmic cafe, is located near my place which I strolled into one morning just for a cup of coffee and noticed their chalkboard menu with amazing bagel selections. My boyfriend and I decided to stay to eat and were pleasantly surprised by the amazing food, bacon, sausage and pancakes!!! I came by again with my best friend and we ordered two bagels! SO AMAZING! If these taste buds could talk... I highly recommend it! It caters to vegetarians and people on the go!"}
{"text":"It does not look like much from the outside but wow what great food awaits inside.  I had the eggs benny and my girlfriend had an amazing omelet. Both were great and the staff is friendly even once they got extremely busy. I don't have a ton to say other than you really need to TRY THIS PLACE if you are ever visiting or live in the city of toronto."}
{"text":"Good food when it actually makes it to the table, but come patient as both times I've stopped in for brunch it took over 30 minutes for a standard breakfast order of eggs/meat/potato and toast ($8.95) to arrive after ordering.  What does grind my gears though, is their ridiculous $2 up charge just for jam. Just to add some flavour to the (usually cold) toast that comes with the breakfast, brings the bill to $11 before tax. Yes, I get that it's home made, but $2 for a side of jam for your toast is pretty ridiculous.   But getting past the jam issue, the place is nice and clean including the bathrooms downstairs, and the patio out back is also an enjoyable feature now that the warmth has arrived. If you're not in a rush and don't mind dropping a couple extra bucks for your food, it's worth trying."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. This was our regular spot for brunch, and previously I had given Rustic Cosmo Cafe 4 stars, but now I'm struggling to give it 3. The past few times we've come, whether the place has been busy or not, our food has been sub-par. The eggs were undercooked (asked for over medium, got over easy), the crispy bacon we asked for was definitely not crispy, and each time, our breakfast potatoes were cold.  Each time in the past 3 visits we've left a large amount of food on the plate. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"An immediate priority when moving to a new neighbourhood is to seek out and find a new \"office,\" aka coffee shop in which to write. A quick stroll landed me at Rustic Cosmo Cafe. I popped in to see what it was like and ordered a Cortado, my latest (apparently pretentious) espresso preference. They didn't know what it was but attempted to make me a beverage that resembled a long macchiato. It was alright and the vibe was fun, so I decided to return the next day to take post and write.  It was busy that morning, but I found a table and they promptly brought me a menu. I ordered a skim cappuccino, but they consistently only have 2% or soy so I was forced to get that instead. It was alright, but I'm truthfully not that into their espresso. Though I continue to order it regardless.   Then I ordered THE BEST BAGEL IN THE WORLD! Although many of their sandwiches have people names, I was not too thrown off biting into my delicious Sarah. Sarah consisted of the best multigrain bagel I've ever had (seriously), generous amounts of avocado, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a perfectly-cooked fried egg. It was only then I realized there was booze here. BOOZE? My mouth watered for a mimosa, but my deadline reached out and slapped me across the face and said ORDER COFFEE, so I did.   I've returned a few times and I've learned the ways. If you want food, go as early as you can. They seem to run out of a lot of ingredients around 1pm, which is a testament to fresh quality but can also be an inconvenience if you're dying for something in particular. That said, everything I've tried there so far has been delicious!   There are no wall outlets, so make sure your writing device is fully charged if you plan to camp out for a while.   And bring a friendly face! Everyone here is incredibly nice."}
{"text":"This is a go-to breakfast spot for me in Parkdale. Why? Because it's cheap and delicious. I usually skip out on their bigger breakfasts and order a Sarah bagel (avocado, cheese and egg) when I'm on the fly because it's under $5.00. That's right, under $5.00 for breakfast. Can't really beat that. And the service is super friendly."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why Rustic Cosmo can't get it together. They have some pretty tasty bagels and bagel sandwiches, but I dread going in there to have a sit-down meal because it always takes an hour between getting there and leaving, even when it's dead inside. I can order the same thing for takeout and get it in 10 minutes, but if I go in I'm waiting 20 minutes for water and for my order to be taken, 30 min for food, and just hoping someone asks me if I want more water in between. So usually I just get takeout, and it's good, and it saves me a lot of time. But today I got a bagel, which I've ordered many times and while they're not usually particularly generous with the cream cheese, usually at least both sides are covered. Not today. Today half the bagel completely missed getting covered. Come on, Rustic Cosmo. You're better than this. Or at least, I want you to be better than this."}
{"text":"Don't order the eggs benedict.  The egg whites were not cooked and the Bearnaise was just wrong.  I know its hard to make poached eggs but really if you just time it then it should have worked out fine.  Obviously the chef on Saturday had no idea whats going on. I should have sent the food back but I didnt want to cause trouble.  I just wont go back"}
{"text":"New favourite brunch place. The food is amazing: a big tasty plateful that is artfully (but not pretentiously) arranged. Great price, too -- less that the other nearby hipster hangouts. Ambiance is welcoming and comfortable, rustic and cool. A place you could hang out in for hours drinking delicious coffee. The service is just the right level of attentiveness, and food/coffee refills arrive quickly. If you order the Eggs Benny you can have a different topping on each english muffin. Very vegetarian friendly, with tofu substitutions for scrambles/burritos. I heart this place."}
{"text":"This is a cozy cafe in the art district. There's not a lot of seating so it can get filled quickly. I went there on a Tuesday morning and barely got the one table left. I got a bacon and avocado omelette with toast that was delicious and filling. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. It can get a little loud because seating is so close, but most people are respectful and keep their conversations at a moderate level."}
{"text":"Waaaay out there on Queen past where it's cool there lives a little cafe. Breakfasts on frigid mornings, soups to slurp and booths to slide into."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one afternoon for a late lunch and had a great experience. The decor was nice with an exposed brick wall and high ceilings, the atmosphere was chill and cozy. The service was friendly.   I had a chicken pesto wrap with mixed greens and a latte. The wrap was delicious. Portion sizes were pretty good, I left feeling satisfied. This place has a great variety of sandwiches/bagels and brunch options as well.  The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 is because I found it a little on the pricey side for what I got; my order came to about $18 after taxes, much more than I'd expect to pay for a simple wrap and latte.   Overall great ambience, great food, great service -- will be back again."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, cozy, owner's always there, all day breakfast, home made jam, quiche...  What more could you want in a cafe?  Maybe that it stay open longer (closes at 4pm)."}
{"text":"Having weekend brunch. Very authentic Queen West location. Service is OK, portions are not great and a little overpriced. Will return for coffee and people watching."}
{"text":"I agree with Gaurav below when he says the servers are a bit...um...forgetful. Luckily they're also pretty friendly so it's easy to overlook. I've only been to Rustic Cosmo for brunch and it was pretty good. There was no wait for a table and the food was decent. I had your standard eggs benedict with homefries. Unfortunately I was unable to stomach more than a bite of the homefries because they were peppered with the most bizarre spice combination ever - I don't know what precisely made up this spice blend but it was unpalatable."}
{"text":"Tasty food that is just really expensive for what it is. I would have done 3.5 stars if I could. It is a solid option for a lunch or breakfast but know that you can be going a block away to get much more value for your money. A breakfast burrito with side of potatoes goes up to almost $20 when down the street at The Beaver the same plus a coffee is under $15 and has more going on. But its good... The breakfast items are great and they have nice wraps and sandwiches for lunch. In the summer they have patio seating and inside is very roomy and comfortable. Servers are nice and relatively quick. Coffee is solid."}
