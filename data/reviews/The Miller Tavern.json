{"text":"One of my new favourite spots.  The food isn't cheap and I find that my satisfaction with the quality depends on what I order.  They had a lamb shank that was to die for. As a server for a recommendation and you won't be disappointed with the food.

This place has some of the best service in the city.  We had to wait 10 minutes to be seated at our table (because we were 15 minutes early, not because they weren't ready) and we were given free glasses of champagne.  This place actually makes you feel like your business is important to them rather than an inconvenience.  Another time, the manager spent 15 minutes trying to find a Canucks game for me on TV even though he was quite busy.

The bartenders, Fraser, Reid and Jay are not only friendly and welcoming, but they make some pretty amazing drinks.  Sorry Bar Chef, I think they may have outdone you since they actually know how to make a Vieux Carr√©."}
{"text":"Very well-kept tavern, with a great ambience.  The waitress was very pleasant, and fast to return drink orders (given it was a Saturday evening when I visited). Was very impressed that the bartender actually knew how to make a proper Whisky Sour cocktail (NO MIX!). Washrooms were tidy. Parking is hard to find and can be a little pricey around the area,but it is to be expected I guess. We chose just to stay for cocktails (a little on the pricey side, but amazing!) but I recall the menu favouring kind of a surf-and-turf theme.

I would go back again, and even have a bite to eat next time as well."}
{"text":"Mediocre pub food. 

Atmosphere feels upscale. Rich furnishings and cozy layout. I could rate them higher based on ambiance but when the food is only so-so I can't really let that slide. 

Food was ok. Nothing special. I had a burger with fries. Solid effort. My fiend had a peanut butter french toast that was bread crumbed and  fried. Heavy and bland. My other friends eggs benny was on brioche that got soggy. 

Expensive. $19 for burger and fries that was only so-so. 

We went here because it was close after center island and it could fit a lot of people. I definitely would not go there if I wasn't in that location."}
{"text":"Had the wagu burger,AMAZING!! definitely will be back. Waiter knew his bar menu extremely well and recommendation were spot on. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time while visiting the city and had a wonderful experience.  Food was very good but what made it was the service.  It was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and full of energy.  He even gave us a complimentary limoncello at the end of our meal which was very nice.

We would come again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Today, my friends and I were in Toronto exploring the islands (We are highschoolers). The three of us decided to eat out! We chose The Miller, and boy was it a mistake! We weren't that hungry so we decided to get an appetizer. The food was mediocre and highly overpriced. considering I paid $19 for a ceaser salad I was expecting to be impressed, I've had better for less. However what I received from this rather high end bar, was a SMALL bowl of wilted lettuce with a dressing that tasted store bought, and a small slice of pancetta. The only thing fresh tasting on this salad was the shredded Parmesan cheese.

Now onto the service we received.
When we entered the restaurant we were quickly seated and handed menus. Now it's downhill from here. Our waiter was disrespectful in how he took our orders, he was unimpressed that we only ordered an appetizer and drinks. After the waiter left, our drinks were brought to us. My friends and I sat in this almost empty restaurant with 2 other tables with parties of 2-3. We waited approximately 20 minutes for our salads, which were like I said before, mediocre.

Overall, unless there is a change in management I will not be returning.
I discourage any and all people who are looking for a good meal, to dine here."}
{"text":"I've tried to give this Miller Tavern a chance on several occasions and every single time I am left disappointed.  I will stick to the Miller on Yonge Street - it's way better and the staff are much nicer and better informed.
 
I was at the Bay Street location last week and I ordered the Seafood Boo-Yah-Base (I think the spelling is clever).  When it arrived I had to question whether I received the right dish or not. It was a plate overflowing with seafood - to the point that it did not look appetizing and the seafood was falling off my plate.....I couldn't move the  move around the food so I can eat it politely in front of my client, and there was absolutely no broth. It was dry as a bone.  When I finally brought this to our waitresses attention she told me that's how it's supposed to be.  She even mentioned to me that someone from \"cirque du soliel\" had ordered it and loved it.  I felt like saying well \"Tamara from Toronto doesn't like it\" but I didn't want to be rude in front of my client.  Anyway, moving on...to several minutes later as I couldn't even get the attention of our waitress. I finally asked if I could have the Lobster Cob salad instead, which, by the way is $29. Serves me right...I should have known better.  I got a freezing cold plate with iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, almost frozen tomatoes and cold and gross lobster, which I think must have been in the freezer/fridge for days.  It was one of those salads you get a self serve station that is prepared in advanced and sits in the fridge all day.  I can get a much better salad at Ikea for a fraction of the price.  I've had the Lobster Cob at the Miller on Yonge street and it's delicious.  This one was horrible.   Btw, my salad arrived as everyone was finishing their meal so it was not fun!  Anyway,...I'm done with this place  I gave this restaurant at least 4 or 5 chances and now I'm done....I will never go back.  I have not had a good meal here ever!"}
{"text":"Great new spot on Bay St. 

The Miller Tavern, a Hoggs Hollow institution, has opened a second location on Bay St., just steps from The Air Canada Centre.

The decor of the restaurant pairs antique finishes such as farm house wood floors and dark leather booths with rivet accents, with a downtown feel including black marble pillars and an eye-catching bar.

I had the privilege of attending the grand opening on Thursday, January 26th. If the turnout was any indication, you can expect this location to be buzzing and busy!

The chefs offered a vast selection of delicious bites throughout the evening, both from The Miller and from the neighboring Fox. 

The offerings included vegetarian spring rolls with spicy thai dipping sauce, crab and shrimp cakes with curried mayo, prime rib sliders with horseradish aioli, arancini with marinara sauce, pulled pork and chicken nachos, chicken satay and the \"signature\" lobster quesadilla (of which I could have easily eaten a dozen! A must try!)

Entrees include steak and fresh seafood, as well as a selection of seasonal items including a delicious pumpkin ravioli. An extensive wine, beer and cocktail list rounds out the menu.

Whether you are looking to stop in for a drink after work or dinner before a concert or game at The Air Canada Centre, The Miller on Bay is a perfect spot that I would highly recommend. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great food, gorgeous interior, and really good service. 

Most people who come here in the evenings are the pre-game folk, who head off to the ACC once the games start, as clearly evidenced by the number of clientele wearing team jerseys! It's funny though, this is definitely not your typical bar. Very classy place. 

We were just here for the food and drinks though :) Started off with red and white glasses of wine, and the charcuterie board. It was delicious! Duck pate especially was rich and so good spread on crusty bread. 

Then our mains: 
1) Special of the day: trout on celeriac croquette and carrot puree. The roasted trout and crunchy skin looked amazing, she devoured this pretty quickly so safe to say, she enjoyed it a lot. 

2) Top sirloin, medium-rare with caesar salad: the steaks were recommended to me so I was excited to try it! It was just mouth-watering.. cooking perfectly, still red with juices, and good-sized portion. Very filling. Caesar salad was good too, not too heavily-dressed. 

3) Miller Tavern burger with sweet potato fries: I tried a bite of this and really liked it! I rarely order burgers when I go out but I would order this! The bun is this soft brioche but is really sturdy, and can hold all the ingredients together well. Not super messy to eat like some burgers. And you can never go wrong with sweet potato fries! 

Later on, we moved to the bar to watch the hockey game on the screen and order some drinks. We had the Tavern Shandy, with Steam Whistle pilsner and St. Germaine in it, really good actually. I don't even usually like lemon! Also had the bartender make us one of his special drinks, maple-flavoured whisky and other things, can't remember but it was a strong drink! Very delicious to sip :) 

In all, we had a great time and would definitely come back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner on double date. We ordered lamb poutine, crab cake, pork chop, pickerel, quesadilla, pad thai and other foods I can't remember now. Foods were good throughout, no complaints here. I had crab cake and pork chop, which were delicious. I've had many bad crab cakes before but this one was different. I could really taste crab meat. Pork chop was cooked nicely and sauce was delicious. 

People I came with were also happy with their foods. 

Service was good but foods came out really slow. Ambiance inside is quiet and comfortable. Our server did her best to make our dining experience a memorable one, and as a result it was one of the best services I've experienced at restaruants in Toronto. 

Cocktail list is extensive, and we ended up trying some but they were not as memorable. 

Don't be fooled by the word \"tavern\" in the name. This is not a pub. It is a rather pricy restaurant with upscale atmosphere. I had to listen to my date bitching about prices and portion during the whole time, which kind of ruined it for us and embarrassed me. But he did have a point in that the portion was too small. But at least they didn't skimp on ingredients like seafoods in pad thai as good amount of seafood chunks was present. 

I sometimes go to York Mills location, and compared to that my experience at Bay location is like 3 stars. Foods are much better there although it is noisier. But Miller on Bay is still an excellent restaurant on its own, in which case in my book York Mills location is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Too pricey, food just okay.  Don't order the roast beef for two - comes raw with hardly any potatoes.  Staff tries hard but food lets them down."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good burger here, but fries were just OK, tasted frozen.  The service, however, was subpar.  It was impossible to get any attention from the wait staff and when we finally did, everything was \"be right there with your water\", \"be right there with the bill\".  All the while they are taking other orders, making drinks and doing everything other than what we asked them.  So basically expect to wait 20 minutes to get even a glass of water."}
{"text":"Not much to review really. We were seated quick enough on Saturday early evening, but after 15 minutes we hadn't seen a waiter to take a drink or meal order, so we left. Pretty disappointing seeing as how everyone else around us was being served. One star for the quick seating."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite and a beer between hockey games at the ACC. I had the burger and sweet potato fries which was excellent. The burger was on a brioche bun and was a mix of ground chuck and filet.....very tasty! My friend had the chicken Caesar salad which she liked but wasn't too keen on the croutons. 

Overall a good choice if your down at the ACC for an event and are in search of food or cocktails!"}
{"text":"The steak was so dry that I couldn't really finish. They charge for everything, even the starter bread. The bread was quite tasty though, I will give 2 stars for that."}
{"text":"Super dead in here, and my food sort of grossed me out. From the outside, it looks like it could be a great time but it just didn't really seem worth it the money. The location was convenient to the Westin, and I will say the wine was a heavy pour, I'll take that! ;)"}
{"text":"The salmon was incredible!  The Wu-Tang clan drinks were amazing (The GZA Bourbon Sour was out of this world) the Method Man cosmo  but the Dulce de Leche cheesecake was by far the best!! New favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food that is mediocre at best. Stopped by for a few apps and drinks recently and had hoped for a step up from The Fox next door but since both are under same ownership, it was a similar sub par experience. In fairness I can only speak to the apps and not the mains. But if these were any indication of the quality of food I would not throw away any more money to find out. Don't bother getting the caprese salad unless you like spending $15 for a thin cut of mozzarella sandwiched between two measly slices of tomato. I have never seen such a sad looking caprese salad in my life.

Calamari for $14 is another one to stay clear of. Your mostly paying for a lot of breadcrumbs and a pasty tasting sauce that will leave its mark on your throat.

The \"this and that combo\" is exactly that - total randomness. Shrimp floating in a soup of melted butter and garlic. Mismatched spring rolls oddly paired with a random bacon and cheese sauce and sweet chili sauce. Take your pick which one you dunk your rolls or beef won tons into but you will be disappointed either way. For a $20 app you would expect way better.

For the money you'll spend here you're best off heading to Esplanade or Maple Leaf Square in the area. Its any wonder that with your bill you get a $25 off a $50 food bill for the Fox.

Service was ok and the decor and seating inside is nice but honestly it does little to make up for the quality of dining."}
{"text":"Not the best of taverns. Burger was good, music wasnt. Barely any girls on a saturday night, bar seats were literally filled with dudes, was charged 5 bucks for soda water. Wont go there again thats for sure."}
{"text":"It looks like a nice place from the outside but I was very disappointed. The food is overpriced and not very good and the service is really bad. I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful and friendly restaurant-pub-eatery. We ate here twice and tried to eat many items on the fantastic menu. The first night our waiter was Gregory, superior guy. He went above and beyond to make our experience outstanding. My husband had the burger, large , juicy and cooked perfectly. I had the halibut , yum ! We also had the Calamari and the tuna tarter. The second night, the Red Wings were playing at home so the place was packed. It made no difference to our waiter Douglas, he just stepped it up a notch for another night of flawless service. This time we tried and enjoyed the lobster cocktail in lettuce wraps and followed that up with the porterhouse with the $5.00, yes 5 bucks, of additional seafood which included a nice sized lobster tail and garlic shrimp. Thank you to all at Miller's Tavern. Eat here you'll thank us too."}
{"text":"Great service! The hostess and server (Trent) were amazing! The server had great suggestions for my budget lol, very kind and friendly. The food was excellent. I had the streak and lobster. The lobster was $1 with the steak! I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Solid place close to the harbor. Scallops  and Caesar side were pretty good, though small. Will def consider a return visit"}
{"text":"Very good food and local beers (and the others too): great place for gathering with friends. Go for a hamburger or fries. The salads are very good too. Not good for the daytime though for the place inside is a bit dark."}
{"text":"Had to order the same platter twice because they forgot to place the first one. The staff tried hard but, sadly, left it all a bit short. 

I fear that they rely too much on pre and post concert goers."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great at first since it's very spacious, clean and modern. So it was in the evening after a hot day and my friends and I sat outside at first. Then we noticed it was getting chilly so we asked the waiter if we can sit inside. The waiter did not seem pleased with the request and had some attitude about it. The waiter seemed very annoyed with us.

So he sat us inside anyway and ordered our food. The food was a bit pricey for what we actually ordered. I ordered the Steak Frites which was ok. It can definitely serve 2 if you want to save some money. The food was good but I wasn't really impressed with the meals since it's very similar to a lot of restaurants we have been too. 

We only stayed for a quick dinner and overall I was not impressed with the food or the service. But if you want to stop by for a quick drink or stop by to eat something quickly before going out then this is an ok place. Just know it's a bit overpriced!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat and a have a few drinks here with a party of 8. I heard a few good things and wanted to try for a while. I was here on a Wednesday night and the tavern was full - good thing we reserved a table in advance. Here's what I liked:

- Good service, fast orders, quick beer / wine refills and we were asked if everything was OK a few times

- Cool laid back atmosphere

- A far more diverse menu vs. traditional pub / bars

- Good quesadillas - The chicken and Pork were very good. A sweet sauce for the pulled pork and BBQ for the chicken. You can also get these meat / sauce combo's with the Nachos. Portions are large (rare on this menu).

- Nachos are average but the sauces noted above are good. Portion is unusually small  for $18 

- Decent crab and shrimp cakes but two cakes for $16 is a bit much

- I had the Halibut and Barley risotto. This was very good and the fish very fresh but the portion was incredibly small for $27. I was still hungry, so I had the quesadilla's for dessert!

- A few people in the group enjoyed various burger combos and the portion was huge here.  

-  Two people had the scallop dinner's and liked them. I sampled this one and enjoyed it. Scallops were cooked perfectly. 

- The neighboring table ordered steaks and the looked good from far. 

- Fries were good, appeared to be home made

- Excellent mixed drink and wine selection for a pub

On the needs improvement side:

- Calamari was over cooked and chewy. Also way too much breading. 

- Poor beer selection - about 8 beers on tap with household names accounting for just over half. They did have a Granville winter ale that was pretty good. 

- Portions are crazy small for many of the dishes (but not all). 

- Prices are on the high end

- The chocolate cake was disappointing. Really just a lava cake which was not heated correctly

I have to go with 3 stars. I like the nontraditional pub menu and cool atmosphere. The limited beer selection, higher prices and small portions make it impossible to rate 4 stars. Not sure I would rush back...

{"text":"Two words: Crab cakes
They make my mouth water just thinking about them.  I crave them.  They are delicious and make me happy.  While waiting for crab cakes, they have a fantastic variety of Manhattan cocktails.  I have tried each one, and the Vieux Carre Manhattan is simply the best.  I've been told they make their own cocktail cherries by aging them in brandy and sugar, but no matter where they came from they take the cocktail over the top!

Unfortunately, I've never found anything outstanding for the main course, though nothing bad either.  Considering the cost, I would give a rating of 3 if it were based on the entrees alone.

For a memorable dessert, the Black Bottom Pecan Pie with cinnamon ice cream is a brilliant combination of sweet caramel, dark chocolate and cinnamon.  

The service is usually excellent and sometimes phenomenal.  For the crab cakes, Manhattans, or the pecan pie alone, the Miller Tavern is well worth the visit and for a new establishment, it shows great promise."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average pub at the base of a condo building.

I had the Miller burger, which was decent, and the lamb poutine, which was disappointing. If the cheese curbs aren't nice and squeeky, why put it on the menu?

My wife had the lobster quesadillas, which she liked, but the actual amount of lobster meat was pretty stingy.

Otherwise, there is a decent beer selection, good service and a nice ambiance.

It's very conveniently located near the ACC and downtown, and the prices reflect this."}

We went here because it was close after center island and it could fit a lot of people. I definitely would not go there if I wasn't in that location."}
{"text":"Rating: 3 1/2* (2 1/2* to 3* for the food and I will say that is a solid 4* for the cocktails)

We were going to a concert at the Air Canada Centre and decided to have dinner beforehand. We picked the Miller as it is conveniently located just minutes from the ACC along with a public parking right in front of it. We made a reservation as we figured that it will probably be busy because of the concert and the dinner rush. 

We were seated promptly when we arrived and it was a good idea that we made the reservation as the place was very busy. Place is big and spacious as we were seated in a booth near the entrance.

Our waiter was great as he was attentive and told us about the specials and some of the dishes in the menu. We went with Crab Cakes to start and ordered the Chicken Schnitzel, the Kebabs and the Halibut as main. We also ordered the Red Mule Cocktail. The food started right as the cocktails and the crab cakes were excellent. However, the mains were just average at best. With the prices that they are charging for them, it was quite disappointing how average they were. 

It seems their close proximity to the ACC, keeps people coming to this place.

Next time, I will come for the drinks and not bother with the food.

{"text":"I was staying at the Westin Harbour Castle for business and needed a good Friday night meal before heading back home. I Googled around for steak, and stumbled across this gem, which was less than a five minute walk from the hotel.

I opted for the Filet Minion (medium rare) with a lobster tail and sauteed mushrooms. There was a Wings-Leafs preseason hockey game on, and was pleasantly surprised to see that I had an unobstructed front row seat at the bar to watch the game.

Friendly staff as well. I was inquiring about WiFi, and before I could ask, the concierge person came up to me, shook my hand (as if we were long-time friends), and then asked me if I needed anything. Very very awesome, and I believe its those little things in life that truly make a difference.

Great stop, and will come back again."}
{"text":"In the august, after centre island, I decided to go to Miller Tavern. I had seating outside patio it was nice. The waitress was really friendly and helped with menu choices. I decided to have the steak and my friend had the salmon. The steak was over done so I returned it and waited for another steak and that was over done again but I was soo hungry I ate it any way. On the other hand my friends salmon was amazing and totally worth getting. The environment of this place was great, trendy and clean.  The steak was off the bill and the manager was apologetic. Just a mediocre place to eat but its still nice."}
{"text":"The Miller Tavern is a new steak house that has opened in the Pinnacle condo tower. It's the \"big brother\" to The Fox. The main attraction is the steaks, but they also have large selection of other mains. I had the tenderlion cooked rare. It was cooked right, nice and tender, but not very juicy. Overall my steak was good, but unsubstantial even with the ceasar salad (which was again good, but nothing special) that accompanied it. In hind sight I should have ordered a second side dish. For desert I had an excellent peanut butter cheese cake. Overall the food was good, but at this price range ($35-40 for a steak) you could probably do better."}
{"text":"Fun, casual place to grab a bite downtown. Plates are well priced with a good selection of drinks on special during brunch hours ($3.95).

Quick service and friendly staff. On my first visit our waitress brought us a round of a tastey drink - on the house. :)"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that looks fairly upscale, the food was extremely disappointing. I ordered the Salmon benedict, and was surprised the find only a sliver of salmon the size of my pinky. My friend ordered the same thing and at first thought the kitchen had forgotten her salmon. She literally had to dig for it like a treasure hunt. I love eggs benedict and order it at every restaurant that had it, and this is the first time I've had one that was not layered with smoked salmon and doused in hollandaise sauce. There was barely any sauce on my dish. The poached egg was also tasteless (Did the cook forget to poach the egg in vinegar?). For $15 (or so),  you'd also expect a portion that would fill you up. Nope. I had to grab another meal right afterwards.

I wanted to speak to the server about my dish (and almost everyone else in the party who were also disappointed with their meals), however no server was to be found until it was time for us to pay.

I usually let bad experiences slide but this one was so particularly bad I had to write about it. Almost everyone in our party (about 20 people) were not satisfied with their meal (taste and portion). I almost wish I had gone home to get my $15 brunch coupon (since it took forever for the food to come out... more than the reasonable amount of time for a party this size), but I have since thrown out that coupon because it'd just be a waste of calories to consume a crappy meal even if it's almost free.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"The Tavern is bright and cheery and strikes me as a great place to unwind after work or at the conclusion of a sports event.  The service and food seemed a bit cookie-cutter to me.  My wasabi caesar salad was OK, but far from transcendent.  I ordered a Miller Burger medium rare and got something that I would have described as well done.  My \"craft beer\" was pretty bland -- certainly not as good as the Hoptical Illusion I had the previous evening.  The bottom line here: my rating is between 2 and 3 stars, but I wouldn't recommend this place to friends and don't expect ever to return."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food. Racist management. Only kept in business by proximity to ACC. 

On Monday afternoon, the restaurant was nearly empty. Despite this, my foreign visitors, two young boys, received a yelling order to leave because they were not familiar with tipping customs. The manager (white middle-aged male) barged out and said mockingly, intending to publicly shame them, \"COME ON! ORDER SOMETHING (again). You are here using MY internet. Leaving no tip. Are you kidding me! Come ON!\" After asking my friends, I promptly and politely apologized and explained it to him. He walked away dismissively, no apology given. Out of decency to the staff, I actually ordered again and tipped heavily. Then, we left. 

I never felt compelled to write on Yelp until now. The behaviour of the manager is so arrogant and disgusting, setting a tone for his staff. Give that this is a tourist area, you would think there's a certain level of worldliness or understanding. None. This is un-Canadian behaviour. 

I live in the neighbourhood and will surely tell my friends nearby to go elsewhere."}

She treated us with respect and was super friendly and sweet. It was packed and we were still in and out with in an hour. Our bill with tip was $100 but worth every penny. I definitely recommend this place 5 star and so yummy!!!:) we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Their mixologists are legit. Fav spot to get a manhattan or any true cocktail. The new patio is also fantastic. Good spot to check out before anything at the ACC or after work drinks."}
{"text":"First off I heard lots about this place mostly through radios so I'd thought I'd give it a try after the import expo show. Underground parking is available for $10 and easy access to bay st. Place is kinda on the smaller side compared to most restaurants. Like the decorations with the Texas mickey's. Center pieces are female legs with heels and stockings. Dimmed light for a more romantic feel. Good for dates. They don't have daily specials on drinks. food is pricey early meal averages around $40. Apps around $20. Their staff aren't well dressed looking unprofessional but they are quite friendly. Floors look like someone spilt acid on the floor Ordered the calamari for starters. Don't like the fact that no lemon wedge is served with the app and contains no baby squid, just served on a plain white dish. calamari tasted like rubber, was cooked in oil that wasn't fresh and oil temperature was low giving it a oil dark outcome. Out of all the calamari I've eaten throughout my years this tastes like rubbish. Totally dreadful. apps come quick around 10mins but you'll have to wait really long for main course meals
Almost 50mins.I order the top steak sirloin and my wife ordered the filet minion. Presentation sucks looks like my steak is swimming oil and the flier minion has more asparagus than steak . The steak was cooked very well to a perfect medium rare but lacked flavour. Had to add salt and pepper to give it flavour. Would rather go to other restaurants and pay less then $40 for a better served steak. Ordered the chocolate caramel for dessert. Cake was a very good portion size and tasted great not to sweet maybe there is hope for this place. my bill came out to $110.18 without tax . Overall I give it 2 stars wouldn't recommend this place smh.

{"text":"Overall it was a pretty good place. Service was a little bit inconsistent and the lobster Thermidor was nothing noteworthy. The sirloin was tender and cooked very well, and the Tavern accommodated my request for a Cobb-Salad. My party also split a bottle of wine which was good and reasonably priced. Convenient location."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about the food which can tend to be a bit on the pricey side for a lower quality but the bar tenders know their stuff. We asked for a mai tai and their version was petty close to the real deal. The gin fizz is also great. I would go back for the drinks not for the food."}
{"text":"Great place and great service!
And the bartender named Rob is the best I've seen in the city"}
{"text":"Overpriced and low quality food. My friends and I came here since we wanted to  eat before going out to the city. I had seen this restaurant in passing for years and have been meaning to come here for a while, now I wish I never did.

The staff were nice and accommodating and the drinks at the bar weren't the best I've had but it wasn't the worst. The decor was like an upscale diner in Toronto but the food was a different story.

I had the Philly Cheesesteak with fries which usually is a safe bet. When the meal came it was a small 6 inch sandwich with fries that weren't really cooked. For $27 this was a huge disappointment, the steak was not seasoned and had no flavor and the cheese didn't  help the sandwich at all. The only way to get through it was to add hot sauce. The only reason you were full was because of the amount of carbs that was on your plate. For $27 dollars I was expecting a good quality and well seasoned steak and was left severely disappointed. This is the type of restaurant were the food sounds good on the menu but when you actually get it, its fails to live up to expectations. My friend got the steak burger which turned out to be dry and unappetizing.


Everything on the menu was pricey and personally I believe the prices are only that high because they are located across the street from the harbor 60 the upscale steakhouse in Toronto. If you're looking for a food in Toronto  their are plenty of places to go that are significantly better quality and at a fraction of the cost. I would definitetly not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the taste and quality of their brunch menu.

I ordered the Hawaian Loco Moco, and the 'gravy' wasn't really a gravy... I ordered it medium-rare, and it turned out medium-well done. They didn't even serve us buns.

I've ate at the Yonge/York Mills location and it is much much better service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Ok first impression is good has good vibe but it can be a little bit noisie. The Jazz is playing all time, so for me is good. The food is ok, i would say normal ... but not explendid. The waiter ask me how do I want my steak tartare ... i just reply to him rare ..."}
{"text":"Maybe there's no glamor being only just a stone's throw away from the Gardiner but the Miller doesn't really do much to be anything other than an old fogey bar. I guess the North York types who stumble downtown for a baseball or Raptors game might find this a safe lifestyle choice pub. Don't expect to find a young, urban crowd here. Or your beer choice in stock. And they close down at 10 pm on a Saturday night. See the bit about this being an old fogey bar. Wonder what will replace it."}
{"text":"The service is amazing. And the food is wonderful I love the decor. Probably in the top 3 restaurants in this area of Toronto."}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat here for my birthday a few days ago - my friend suggested either this spot or Golden Thai and I decided to go HERE because I figured it was not as \"dressy\" as Golden Thai would be (it's called a tavern and I was not dressed appropriately to be seen in public) and I ALWAYS have Thai; and trying new things is a good thing in my books - not this time.

This spot gets the two stars BECAUSE our WAITRESS was awesomely attentive and overall helpful and sweet. I didn't like the drink she suggested but that's because I was stupid and didn't listen to my inner alcoholic and stick to tequila drinks and tried something new, and it was just not my bowl of martini, that's all; but I am getting ahead of myself.

PROS:
Really nice spot - there were a mix of dressed up and uber casuals which made blending in an easy task for me. I LOVE the big cushiony booths that provided sense of privacy despite the closely arranged tables nearby. 
As I said before, uber helpful and smiley staff which I appreciated as they seem to be something of a diminishing group. A simple but interesting menu items that made you go, \"hummmm...that sounds interesting, I will try that\" and step boldly out of your comfort zone. The presentation of the food was alright too.
sizable wine list for the wine lovers - can't say about the quality cuz I am ignorant when it comes to wine. Also if you are expecting your regular Screwdriver to be on the menu, its not gonna happen; drinks were...well , not for the average Joe Schmuck.

CONS:
Slow service: this could have been due to the fact they may have been shorthanded and it was a Saturday so I won't hold it against them..
EXPENSIVE. We ordered an appetizer platter thing called \"This & That \" (which usually allows at least ONE item per mouth) that didn't satisfy all mouths. While they were delicious it was not worth the $20 we paid for . My friends ordered a $20 Quesadillas which I would assume, came from either an 8 or 10\" tortilla. 4 little slices that left for something more to be desired. I got a $23 scallops dish that came in a huge plate with a 5\" bowl where the food was ... I swear there wasn't enough even to fill a small can of soup. But the 3 HUGE pieces of scallops were awesome(but you can't really go wrong with scallops).The small portion initially was a cause for grunt but turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
Look at the description for what I had: \"Herbed Scallops\" asparagus & saron risotto, beluga lentils, buernut squash,toasted pumpkin seeds\"- delicious right? 

NO. it was not. 
Besides the scallops I did not enjoy. I have very little bias when it comes to food, and this dish had all my loves- yet it managed to taste like grains mixed with old sour cream. I could not wait until the last bite - I am cheap enough that I would have licked the sauce off the plate to get my money's worth but I couldn't lick this sauce. It even left a memento and left my palette disdained for dessert. WHAT? NO DESSERT??! and no birthday cakes offered here, proving to the first restaurant to agree that birthdays shouldn't be celebrated after 25 since it's just reminding us that we're a year closer to death.

Anyway No go for me. Not even for my friends who like to spend a lot on their food ,even mediocre ones.

Urgh. I need to find a spot where I can write a 5 star...:( these low reviews are so not good for my foodie soul :S"}
{"text":"Pretty accurate reviews.  Service is poor and price point is way too high for the food.  Good location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The restaurant is conviently located near Air Canada Centre. It has plently of seating for both indoors or patio. Unfortunately the service and food was a bit of a miss for our group. Drinks and food came out slow, and the food was not memorable."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Decent place for drinks though. Service is excellent and friendly, but I should also note that I came during after-dinner hours and it was relatively quiet. Great patio makes this a nice place to chill in the summer. It's just not a place worth trying to fight the crowds for (i.e. whenever there is a sports event or concert happening nearby)."}
{"text":"This place does not live up to first impressions.  The place seemed lively and the aromas of the kitchen were inviting.  The service was excellent.  The hostess quickly seated me and took the name of my soon to arrive guest in order to direct them to my table. Our waitress made a dismal food experience tolerable. 

We only ordered the mixed appetizer plate which arrived promptly.  The food was dull and stale.  The garnish was wilted, the nacho chips stale, and the guacamole tasteless.  We were overrun with FRUIT FLIES buzzing around.  We did mention it to a passing waiter who informed the manager.  15 minutes later he approached us, thanked us for our input, and walked away. Obviously we weren't the first to mention this. 

2 stars only because the waitress was great.   With all the great place especially to eat on Toronto don't waste your time, money or taste buds here."}
{"text":"At here twice during conference at Westin. Food good - servers nice - food takes a while to come out though so if you're going for lunch you need at least 90 minutes."}
{"text":"I joined friends for dinner, who were in town staying at a nearby hotel. I was looking forward to trying this place as I've only ever heard positive comments about the original Miller Tavern, close to my home. Unfortunately, I was disappointed and my experience leaves me no desire to try the north Yonge location.

My friends had the daily special: steak frites. The fries were tasty--A thicker shoestring and I think they were battered. They were nice and crispy. The medium steak was a little overdone. Also what was odd is that it appeared as if it was sliced before it was cooked--not after. It resembled the main component of a beef stir fry. Both my friends were not too fond of their meals, \"It's alright\" is what they said. ($19)

I had the salmon special which came with a succotash and a potato pancake. The server praised my choice and told me how tasty it was. The salmon was, like the steak, slightly overcooked and a little dry (but the flavour was good). The succotash was, meh. Reminded me of a can of mixed vegetables. The potato pancake was heavy, very greasy and rubbery, as if it was made well in advance and microwaved. I would not order this again. (I don't remember the price)

Desserts were a disappointment and it seems, pulled from the freezer before they were brought to our table. Two of us ordered crepes with bananas and Nutella. The crepes were obviously frozen as proven by their temperature, but also by the watery condensation on top...so watery that the powdered sugar that was sprinkled on top melted before it reached out table and resulted in a clear syrup like concoction that glistened the top of the crepes. My friend's cr√®me br√ªl√©e was was cold and clear that the sugar crust was not prepared-to-order. (I think these desserts were $9 each)

Upon arriving, we were immediately greeted by the hostess and out server had a positive, helpful attitude. Service was a little sloppy but was warm and friendly which made up for the quality of the meal.

As another reviewer commented, the prices appear to be steep and a little unreasonable based on the quality of the food I tried.  We had the specials which were not pricey but the regular menu items certainly were. 

The decor is masculine and a little dated. Think \"old library.\" There are those leg laps from \"A Christmas Story\" everywhere and empty Texas mickey bottles of booze. 

I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered their daily special, which was moules-frites (mussels and fries) for dinner on a weekend. I was super excited as it is a classic Belgian dish that I fancied ordering whenever the option was available. The price was also reasonable, at around twenty bucks before tax and gratuities.

The moules-frites came in a rich white sauce and a pretzel on top. The sauce was very flavorful and blended with the fries, which made it even tastier!

However, the pretzel was really really salty. It felt like the pretzel was dunked in salt and I had to try to scrape it off (did not work) - I did not end up eating the pretzel at all, which was a shame.

The portion size was good, although I wish they separated out the fries with the mussels (where other places usually do), as although the sauce was great to dip with the fries, it also made the fries soggy at the end of the meal. As well, the mayo that was given as the dipping for fries was also on the plate, so it was overload of sauces which made the overall dish a bit strong on the flavour and richness.

I would recommend ordering this if you like seafood, but make sure you ask for mayo on the side, and less salt on the pretzel!"}
{"text":"Come here regularly as convenient for relaxed dining; cozy in the Winter and good patio in the Summer.  Not high end or special but cocktails, wine list and food are all regularly good, and most of the staff friendly and provide good service."}
{"text":"I've had two meals here.
Only reason for the 2nd shot was because i worked in a number of restaurants years ago and know that experiences at the same restaurant can vary. I also live right beside the place... so figured to give it a second shot...
Both meals, equally marginal.
Service both times mediocre, and at times, FLAT RUDE!

The patio, which is aesthetically pleasing at first, is COMPLETELY WORTHLESS because of the constant noise coming off the Gardiner right above you, the lakeshore right beside you and the big ramp/intersection the patio faces. 2Pm lunch, I could barely hear the person across from me because of the noise.
ABSOLUTELY NOT worth the Double Premium you pay for a \"upscale\" pub, thats located next to the ACC.
Take the 5 minute walk to the Keg on Esplanade EVERY. SINGLE. TIME."}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced with small portions.  Also, the waiter had really bad breath, and the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"This place used to have the upscale feel of something reminiscent of an old-style restaurant from Chicago or New York, with Manhattans and Old-Fashioneds served up like water.   It was a go to spot for after work drinks.  Went there recently and it felt like a Shoeless Joe's:  Wu-Tang clan playing in the background at a super-high volume, Sportsnet on the TV's, and really loud atmosphere.  Booked a business meeting for drinks and it was not the ambience I was expecting...catering to a pre-game crowd I suppose as it's close to the ACC."}
{"text":"Before the Toronto Rock game this evening, Gord and I had supper at the Miller Tavern, which is near the Air Canada Centre.  We were seated in the bar area

Gord ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger.  It was quite a hearty burger and he enjoyed it.  He said he'd get it again.

I ordered a Slow Roasted Turkey Club (without lettuce and cheese) and it was good too!  The bun was nice and soft it too was a hearty sandwich.  I'd get it again. 

Chanele was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you are looking for crazy or classic cocktails. Our bartender was the real deal. I only had cocktails, so I can't comment further. I recommend a stop here."}
{"text":"I'm rating Miller on 3 things: the bar, the drinks and the mixologists working. All Awesome.

The bar is kick ass. White marble tops, comfy high chairs and big tvs. 

The drinks are awesome. I'm a huge fan of classic cocktails like Manhattans, and anything that's shaken vs stirred + anything that has bitters. This place makes their own bitters and has roughly a dozen others. Not just the Augusta bitters that every bar has. 

What I appreciate about the Miller is their innovation, I had a hickory smoked Manhattan and another one with jerk spice, one with chocolate bitters and one with chipotle bitters. Then I moved to some gin based drinks where it was lit on fire a few times and finished with a bitters mist spray. Who does this? They do, cause the care!

All the drinks are prepped meticulously by the mixologists behind the bar. Pretty cool to watch the guys and gal do their work.

Tell the bar keep what you like and they'll whip up something for you. 

Working across the street means I'll be back. for more liquid gold. Patio looks like it will be ready soon too."}
{"text":"It was fine.  Expected better quality steak judging from the price point and menu description.  Doneness was an issue for some in our group.  We were seated in a room we had to ourselves which was cool, the loud fan (AC unit?) was annoying.  Server was friendly if a bit overzealous.  Good choice maybe before an event at the ACC but not a destination."}
{"text":"VIBE 
I like this place because it's unassuming. Service is spot-on, there are plenty of booths and it's not noisy. The ideal place to catch up with friends and have a beer or cocktail. Plus, close to Union station. 

WE ATE
They make a pretty solid burger here. But a drink and a burger is going to cost you $30. Not as cheap as I'd like but the quality is there. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
The place to go when noone can decide on anything and everyone is coming from everywhere (or are too lazy to go far from their Lakeshore condo). No fuss. No muss."}
{"text":"Convenient location and nice patio but mediocre food.  

Starting with the dim sum platter, I know I shouldn't expect authentic dim sum but the taste was not the best. For my entree, I ordered the wild sockeye salmon and it was completely raw in the centre. I can barely cut it with a knife.  Since I was with a bunch of clients, I didn't want to creat a scene and send it back so I pretty much just ate around the centre of the raw fillet and left 3/4 of the fish on the plate. That dish cost $28 which I thought was a bit pricey for a bar/tavern kind of establishment.  

Our waitress was not friendly at all, barely crack a smile the entire time but she was quick to refill our water."}
{"text":"If you are staying by the harbor and want to try a neat place within walking distance this is a good choice for you. The food is good and the drinks are great. The menu isn't incredibly original but the food is fresh and well balanced in flavor. I enjoyed the drinks here most so I would recommend it for a brunch or after work spot. Let the drink be the star of your meal."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for their drinks.
Their food is really good, if a bit pricey, but not enough to knock this rating from a 5 star.

This place has become my local favourite because of the drinks they make. Although they have a menu of preset drinks, every time I go there I just say the following:

\"Can the barkeep just make me a whatever? Just tell him to make me something off the top of his head. I prefer it to be made with X (insert favourite alcohol)\"

Every time it comes back to me, its a great drink. Some are potent, some are mixed, some have egg whites, some have a green pepper in it, but the fun is seeing what's put in front of you!

This place reminds me of Barchef, but much much cheaper and just as good, with a more business rather than late night lounge setting. I find that whenever they make me a magic cocktail, I'm only charged between $9-$12 per drink. I feel that is completely reasonable considering I just say \"make me something\" and the guys put something great together every time.

I will say that their food menu is at least wide ranging in their pricing. If you want some munchy food, their prices are reasonable. If you are looking for a dinner type fare, you are looking in the $25 to $35 range. If that is a problem for you, get munchy food."}
{"text":"A 2.5

Service is OK, not more. Place is OK, no fanciness, not comfy. Again, the minimum required.

Food is unfortunately only OK, if not less... we ordered 3 different red meat-based entrees, all medium-rare, and all came medium-done, dry and luke warm, but tender. Miller's poutine is good.

Pricey for the quality ie really overpriced."}
{"text":"Great Location... Food, barely average
My son and I went here to kill time before the 'Hip' concert Aug. 10.  Location is obviously perfect for a pre-show. Atmosphere is nice. Bar menu very good.
It's a BAR
...more so than a restaurant, I feel.  Quality of cocktails are good, great patio and atmosphere.

FOOD
Disappointed. Normally, I shouldn't expect high standards at a 'bar', but when they have a specific STEAK menu, I expect the steaks to be of good quality.  Very disappointed that my fav. cut, (rib steak, which was $ at $50) was tough. My son had the Chicken Club, which came on a hamburger bun - again, a disappointement. A 'Club' should be 3 layers; otherwise, this was just the makings of a typical sammy on, strangely, a run of the mill hamburger bun. 
I think I wouldn't have been disapointed with the food had I ordered items from the chalk board.
SERVICE
Was great. And yes, normally, I wouldn't hesitate to send things back, but it was super busy, it's not the waiter's fault, and I don't think my steak would've been any better if I had a second one.  
If there is a steak menu, I expect it to be at least on par with, say, the Keg.  It wasn't even close.
However, it's a good location and atmosphere for a pre-concert sp"}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner. Waiter was great and friendly. Very attentive. Food was quick and tasted good. Would definitely return for a second visit. Prices reasonable. Menu is pretty much steak or seafood. Didn't even see veg or chicken option."}
{"text":"So, high hopes and meh.

Pros?
Great wine list, very reasonable prices on features and such.  A few great beers on tap
Cons
Service wasn't great and I was only person at bar, super expensive food.  That would be ok if  it was good food.

Either hire a decent chef or don't put stuff on the menu they can't execute well.

Also, when I didn't finish my plate and also commented othe shortcomings of the dish, the staff were completely disinterested.

I don't expect an interview or comp the food, but if you're gonna charge $20 for a lunch pasta, and it isn't made well, don't do it, and fix it.

Will go again for wine/beer if it is convenient, and maybe a snack, otherwise so many better options nearby."}
