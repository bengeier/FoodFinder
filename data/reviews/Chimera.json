{"text":"When Chimera opened on Sherbrooke I questioned the judgement of opening another café along this strip of NDG. A few months later it is my go to neighbourhood coffee spot. Many small cafés portend to know something about their coffee and come across as pretentious and a bit off base. Chimera is the real deal. You would be hard pressed to find a savvier batch of coffee connoisseurs in the city. No, not NDG: Montreal. Really.  The staff there have never been less then friendly and charismatic. The game store located in the back is just separate enough from the rest of the business to keep the puritan coffee drinkers and the gamers safely apart... don't be surprised if you come here for the coffee swearing you will never lower yourself to gaming only to find yourself staring down a group at another table with an odd game and transitioning over to the store to peruse.  There is another space in the basement for the more hardcore gaming types to play Dungeons and Dragons and other card and role playing games that might scare the locals a little. ;) If you buzz in expecting a sanitized, Seattle-style barista joint with over sweetened drinks, clever nicknames for sizes and dozens of freelancers drafting contracts, PSDs and web site designs, this ain't the place for you. If you love delicately flavoured espressos, perfectly crafted lattes and a swath of loveable nerdiness... then game on.  This was a new business this year and there have been some small changes to better accomodate folk as the demands become more clear. They have boosted seating and the menu to better match the wants of the folk in the neighbourhood. I do take issue with the reviewer posting a 1 star review (ZS). The attitude she portends to have experienced sounds to me like a reflection of her sense of entitlement. I've witnessed the staff there handle all manner of requests with good communication and empathy."}

They prepare the cappuccino just the way it like it!  I came for the coffee but I will definitely return with friends to enjoy an evening of board games!"}
{"text":"I had a great time!   When you first enter Chimera there is a sense of geeky wonder that strikes your curiosity to sit, sip on a latte, and play some board games.   The ambiance is usually quiet depending on who is playing what board games. (TROUBLE) As well, the decorative hexagon theme gives Chimera a unique and intellectual atmosphere even when playing the most simple-minded of games.  The staff is very courteous and rarely make mistakes. Supposedly they do, \"WHERE'S MY DANISH CROISSANT?!\" a complimentary cookie will most likely quench your bitterness. (We forgive you.)  In conclusion, I give Chimera 5 fire breathing lion heads out of 5."}
