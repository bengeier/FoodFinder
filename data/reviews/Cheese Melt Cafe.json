{"text":"What an awesome suprise!  We eat at the food court often but had not been there in a couple of weeks.  The food was awesome.  I started with the Chicken Noodle soup which might just be the best I have ever had.  I had grilled Havarti, cheddar, and a fried egg on sourdough bread.  It was cooked perfectly!!!!  Delicious.  You must try this place."}
{"text":"I am something of a grilled cheese connoisseur. After a long day at work, it's my go-to dinner - and I make a mean one (using an old Sunbeam electric frying pan that belonged to my grandmother before I was born). So I was eager to see what the Cheese Melt Cafe had to offer - and if they could live up to my homemade standards. I stopped there yesterday (on a very rare trip to West Towne) and got a cheddar with bacon on rye to go.  I'll just get right to it - YUM. Perfect proportions of each ingredient, perfectly melted, perfectly toasted. I didn't check out their other offerings, but a patron ahead of me got an order of fries and they looked so good, I was envious.  The only thing that bums me out is that I have to negotiate an always-packed mall parking lot to get to the Cheese Melt Cafe - or I'd be more likely to make it a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Perfect comfort food, grilled cheese sandwiches.  Nice selection of breads to choose from, along with a number of different cheeses. You can add meat to your sandwich if you like as well... for a fee. There is soup to go with the sandwich, which I have not tried, and if you are looking to go lighter, there is a salad option as well.  My biggest issue with the sandwich you get is the cheese is not melted enough. I have eaten here a couple of times, and both times the bread is toasted a little light and the cheese is barely melted in the middle. A few more minutes would solve this problem. The sandwich is good, but with the lack of melting, it is hard to become a big fan of this place.  But for some comfort food, and something warm to eat, it does make a good option from the typical burgers/subs/asian food options at the food court."}
