{"text":"I have been coming here for about 13 years and I am a huge fan. Though the actual restaurant/ decor might throw some people off, the food is fantastic and the portions are large for the money you are paying. The main waitress always recognizes us and is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent quality, huge portions, superb service, great ambaince. Perfect experience. In a sea of sub-par diners and restaurants, The Greek Texan is a true gem. I've been going for 25 years, and this place kicks the sh#* out of any other diner, restaurant or over-rated franchise money-pit. Even not compared in a relative-to manner, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"If cheap and quick food is your style, you won't do much better than this restaurant. Especially with the amount of food you get.

The food is great. There's nothing on the menu that I dislike. And cheap beer too.

The only real negative is that there's one server, an older lady, who can be rather unpleasant. Not actively rude, but she doesn't seem to pay very much attention to orders. Makes mistakes fairly frequently, if she even noticed you sitting down."}
{"text":"Yeah it's inexpensive, good portions. But the food sucked and the ambiance was dingy and and gross. Seemed like a hole."}
{"text":"Restaurant has been closed for months.
Looks like the original owners son George ran the place into the ground.
LOL."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. I had late breakfast here with a group of people. Ordered eggs and rye bread for myself and had French toast. The omelette had burned marks. Later, wItress never returned to cash out. Maybe they forgot?
Paid 15.00 for this which is not inexpensive actually a lot for weird food. The rye bread was not even really rye. I also got ill from the cheap oil, had bacteria. You can't go use the washroom, it's under construction. I'm wondering how sanitary the entire place is. Save a trip and make your own Greek Salad!!!"}
