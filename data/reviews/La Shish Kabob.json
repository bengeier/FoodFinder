{"text":"Falafel pitas, with hot sauce?  Delish! Hummus?  Delish! Tabbouleh?  Delish! Babba ganoush?  Delish!  Service?  Outstanding!  (The owner loves children... has a gaggle of them himself.)  Price?  5 pitas, hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, and a bag of pitas ~$25.00  The BEST picnic to-go in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We used to live right around the corner several years ago and drove by it all the time, but never stopped.  I used to live in Washington, DC and loved the kabob places (Moby Dick, for one) there and was looking to find a favorite here in Charlotte.  As has been mentioned, this is a little deli looking place in a small, old strip center.  Neighborhood has been a downward slide for years (even though we enjoyed living over here), but location and physical appearance shouldn't be a determining factor when choosing specialty cuisine.  This is a more traditional kabob stop than you might find in Dilworth or Ballantyne.  It's very traditional with a very good menu.  We always choose the mixed grill kabobs with the special rice (includes grilled eggplant) and a salad with a nice lemon dressing.  Lots of food and the meat is always cooked just right.  This was not what I was looking for originally to match what I used to get in Washington, DC, which was much different fare, but it has been a nice discovery.  Kabobs aren't kabobs everywhere with the different ethnic regions each having their unique styles and ingredients.  This still very much fits the bill for what we were looking for and we will continue to come here for a good meal."}
{"text":"Go! Best lamb wrap in town. Tabbouleh is wonderful and they have great specials to boot. Drive across town if you have to, but go!"}
{"text":"Calling all Muslims and Jews!  Peace in the Middle East (or Middle Earth, as Bruno calls it) is possible through food.  We saw all types of people eating here when we had dinner.  The owner and chef looks like that dude from Survivor a few years ago, with the tie-dye shirt and curly hair.  And wow, does he make a mean kabob.  Their signature dish appears to be the kabob platter with three kabobs and kafta.  The kafta was served over a bed of delicious brown rice and with a grilled tomato that oozed with flavor.  Heavens to Betsy, it was good.  The apple of my eye (the wife) had the lamb special and she said its authenticity almost did her in.  The lamb was tender with a yoghurt sauce and nuts.  Lots of great food and very reasonably priced.  If you go, pick up a CD of Arabic Groove, roll down the windows of the car and blast it as you approach this small gem of a restaurant on the east side (yes, the east side, say it proud, say it loud) of Charlotte."}
{"text":"LaShish has thee best lentil soup! I could eat it daily. Their hummus is equally as tasty,  as is everything else! I have never had a bad taste experience with anything sampled. The service is always friendly and food is freshly prepared. This is my \"go to\" spot when I am tired of fast food or meat-heavy eating (great selection of vegetarian options as well)."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a gem. The owner is a sweetheart and recognize me each time I come in. The food is good and you can find healthy items on the menu. I eat there every Other Thursday when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"I love the falafel-it's the best I've had really. The shawarma is really good also. The fries that come with the shawarma are always pretty sub par but I'm not coming for the fries obviously, so it's whatever. Oh and they have this dip that comes with the shawarma-I'm pretty sure it's just garlic and mayonnaise but it is so good! Homemade grape leaves-just tons of really yummy food!"}
{"text":"Loved the grilled chicken. And the price of the food is reallly low.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Three of us were in East Charlotte and decided to try this place out. I had the gyro with fries and my two friends had the chicken shawarma with fries and the grilled beef kabob with lentil soup and rice.   The grilled beef kabob was the tastiest. Probably about 12 small pieces of beef on a plateful of rice. He said the creamy lentil soup was delicious.   My gyro left a lot to be desired. If you're used to gyros with tzatziki sauce, prepare for disappointment. The pita was fairly large, but there wasn't much meat on it. The menu says it comes with tahini sauce, but it was more like a watery mayo without any of the flavor of tahini. It also had pickles which are different on a gyro, but I like pickles, so that was fine. The french fries were the same as frozen fries from a grocery store.  The chicken shawarma included two wraps and regular fries. It was pretty dry according to my friend.   Since all of us are water drinkers, we asked for glasses of water. Impossible to have here. You have to have the bottled water. The menu says it's spring water, but it's cheap purified water.   Service to the table was efficient, but no one checked on us at any time. The owner was friendly as others have mentioned when we went up to order and pay the bill.  Our bill came to $32 and change."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love everything there except the kabsa rice but that's just me. Burgers are good. They pile on the veggies. Owner is nice. Freshly made food always has my mouth watering."}
{"text":"Went here with my Mom. She had tabouli  and hummus. I had the mixed kebab plate with rice and lentil soup. We were both very impressed with the taste of the food. Each meat was seasoned perfectly  and not with the same seasoning it seems. The hummus  was so creamy. Those were the stars for us but all dishes were great and the service was super fast. I recommend a dinner here. We are already planning our next order!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Fresh and great service.  Here for first time... Very helpful in choosing items from the menu."}
{"text":"Great food - good / straightforward service.  Had the lamb shank special - def recommend you get it ($15 for 2 shanks) really enjoyed the lentil soup. Had to order a side of falafel & they were some of then best I've tried    Only wish they stop using styrofoam \"trash containers\" they do not match the quality of their food ..."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is getting the reviews it does. We lived in Los Angeles for seven years and ate all kinds of Middle Eastern food all over the city. This place is terrible. We got a few apps- the falafel and the kibbeh were the only things decent (oh and the cuc, tomato stuff they gave you when you sat down). The Baba had no flavor, the kibbeh had a weird, not good, taste and the meat pies were disgusting. We also got the chicken schwarma wrap. The chicken was old and hard- the worst pieces of meat were put in it. When the guy asked us if we wanted to take home the almost whole wrap we were leaving behind, and we said no, he didn't ask why. The kafta (kofta) was eh. Not very flavorful and it was flat. It's supposed to be log or cigar shaped- helps it be juicier, not to mention it's more meat. And the atmosphere/facilities are as bad as many ppl said but it also felt dirty. And I won't even say how scary it was to see the cook place vegetables on the grill right next to the raw meat. It might have helped if the veggies came out hot and cooked but they were cold with practically no sear. Nasty."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this place deceive you. The food is fantastic! My husband and I order food from La Shish at least once a week. Our favorite is the shwarma (it's SO good!), but you can't go wrong with any of the menu items. The owner is super friendly and always recognizes us when we come in. Love this place."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular and an amazing bargain. The portions are so huge I ended up packing over half of it up to take home. The restaurant is small, clean and by no means fancy with friendly people there to help you (the best kind of place for me). The proprietor was very helpful when we asked questions and when he took the lid off his braised lamb shanks I'm fairly certain my eyes rolled back into my head. I posted a picture of the refrigerator case where the kabobs and salads are, which you can see is all very fresh and ready to go. I only wish I'd taken a picture of the rotisserie, but once the food came out I had a one-track mind.   The baba ghannouj is absolutely amazing. The eggplant is cooked on the grill so you get far more smoky flavor than you ordinarily get in it. Admittedly we didn't leave a whole lot of it to bring home since it came to the table with hot flat bread and we pounced on it like a pack of hungry wolves, so I had to get another order to go. You know... for medicinal purposes.. :)  The lamb kabob was very tender, even though it was slightly overcooked for my taste (which actually says quite a lot since lamb is usually not tender if overcooked). The spiced rice was very delicious and probably way too much of it but I won't complain since that means more delicious leftovers. In general their 'side dishes' are not side portions - if you have soup you get a whole bowl, not a cup, and the rice seems almost bottomless. And as long as we're on the subject of their soup, the lentil soup is absolutely delicious - perfectly seasoned and while we had it on a warm June day I could definitely see a bowl of this stuff setting the world back to right on a cold winter day. The side salad was very crisp and fresh with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber laced with parsley and mint. It arrives undressed and you drizzle it with the lemon juice at the table, it hits a whole lot of right spots on a hot day.  ***** 3/26/2014 ***** Move forward and after MANY visits this wonderful find still rates a solid 5 stars and then some!   I've been back several times and had various items on the menu. Every one of them amazing. And remember my comment on my lamb being slightly overdone? Ya, forget that... the owner remembers me from the first time I brought this up, and ALWAYS remembers exactly how I like my lamb cooked. That personal touch is what pushes this place WAY over 5 stars for me. Plus have you seen the sanitation rating???? How many perfect scores do you see these days.. but it doesn't surprise me. This restaurant is meticulously clean. Not just up front either - if you peek back into the kitchens you can see they are also very clean and well organized."}
{"text":"Love the food. Has become a weekly spot for us now. Only complaint would be not always getting everything with a to-go order. Just make sure you double check before heading out. Otherwise... Great!!"}
{"text":"Deeeelicious!!! Had the falafel and it was super good!! My friend had the daily special: hen, potatoes, rice, veggies. It was awesome, big portions too!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.... The best service and amazing food! Wish I lived closer I would be here everyday!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The best middle eastern food hands down.  The service was fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write a review for this place but didn't get a chance until now.  I was visiting Charlotte, NC for a conference in November 2014.  I met the owner, very graceful and hospitable man, may God bless him and his family always!!!  He deserves 100 stars and I'm not just saying that out of no-where!!!   The service he provided was absolutely wonderful!  The food tasted great!!  I had ordered the full Cornish hen with rice and had substituted another side for hummus.  The portions were huge!!! I had also ordered some food to take with me on the next morning flight for my husband (chicken kabobs and other items) and the owner packed everything for me in very good packaging (for the flight).  My husband really enjoyed the meal the next night.  The food was great, the place was super clean (even the bathrooms), the prices were very reasonable (or even cheap compared to Bay Area) and the portions were huge.  On top of that, the service was very welcoming and hospitable.  What else can you ask for in a restaurant!!!   I wish we had such great tasting Arabic restaurants in the Bay Area.  If I ever get a chance to go back to Charlotte, I will definitely ask him the recipe for the most flavorful yellow rice I've tried in the whole world.  Thank you for providing such great food and great service to a hungry customer at close to 10pm at night.  God bless you!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place for more than 5 times. Every time I have found the food to be fresh and tasty. The mixed grilled kebabs with a side soup and salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"Ohh my mama. I have to take back charlotte has nothing to offer. Just came from this spot that I had bookmarked for a while. Great food and plenty to eat thrice. The owner I think was very personal despite the streaming customers coming in. This is my spot and I'll be back. Thank you for taking me to a Middle East trip."}
{"text":"This is place is awesome.  I have been going here for 3 years.  Lamb shanks are very flavorful.  The chicken is amazing.  You cant go wrong here!!  Oh yeah very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"La shish is one of the best places to eat middle eastern food in charlotte. I eat here frequently. The service is always fast. The food tastes really good and it s really cheap for an exceptional quality of food."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place good.  When a co-worker said he wanted to take me to grab Palestinian grub for lunch, I'll admit, I wasn't that excited.  He saw it advertised in the Observer.  When we pulled up outside of the strip mall where this place is located, I was less excited.  Stepping inside your eyes won't be impressed, but your nose will, and soon, so will your tastebuds.  Nothing fancy about this joint, but the food is outstanding (they were actually cooking an authentic Jordanian dish as a lunch special) and the service is warm.  I tried the Shwarma meal, which is two slightly grilled pitas stufed with chicken shwarma, veggies, and a cool sauce served with slaw and fries.  Really good.  Coworkers ordered chicken shish kabob wraps and kafta wraps.  Both claimed they were outstanding.  The hummus at the table behind us looked great, too.   Maybe the best part, though, is that the meal was cheap.  Ridiculously cheap.    You can even grab seasoned rotisserie chickens in a family deal to go...something like two chickens, rice, a side (I think) for something like $24.  Not a bad deal.  If they were located on East Blvd, they would have a line out the door every day during lunch and could charge twice as much.  Not very many places to sit inside, so arrive in an \"off\" time or plan on getting it to go.  Great work.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The owner is super friendly and the gyros and whole chicken are really good. It can get kind of crowded, and the place is small, but the food totally makes up for that."}
{"text":"Okay this is going to be not so glowing review for their cheeseburger. $5.99 for a cheeseburger and small side of fries is a little pricey but the meat is halal so thats forgivable. However- the hamburger could be greatly improved. the only thing that got attention on this hamburger is the meat- assumably thawed and microwaved? There was no char on my meat. Other than that, everything else was just plopped on- some lettuce, pickles, tomato, and a cold bun. The saving grace was the ketchup and white sauce that was already squirted on my burger.  I think they could make the hamburger better by caramelizing the onions and toasting up the bun.  Otherwise, they just want you to be happy that you at least get a halal hamburger and be satisfied with that. I wont be coming back for this hamburger. But i will be back for their authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Great food!! We go here at least once a month.  Definitely get the lamb shank - enough to feed 2 people.  And the price is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We ordered catering for a very large dinner party (70 people), and everyone was raving about the food. It took a while to negotiate our order and the menu, but they provided a fair price, and prompt delivery service. The baklava arrived warm! Highly recommend La Shish Kabob for any catering services. Will definitely visit the restaurant soon. Also, the portions are very large, so if ordering for catering, plan to have plenty of left overs."}
{"text":"Great food!  Was not sure what to expect when we arrive as it is a storefront type restaurant .  The kabobs were outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing prices. If you're in the mood for middle eastern cuisine in Charlotte do not look further. I've tried them all and this takes the top spot."}
{"text":"We went to the buffet and it was just ok but out of a lot of hot things that weren't replenished. They microwaved our kunefe which ruined it! No one wants microwaved kunefe, it's soggy and the cheese becomes congealed and too chewy. Why would you microwave kunefe at a restaurant? Give us a warning! :/ The beauty of kunefe is crunchy on top with melty cheese between and drowned in rose water simple syrup.  Nothing is better than putting your fork into the first piece and hearing that crunch! What a disappointment to an already lackluster meal."}
{"text":"Anyone who loves great food should eat here. Authentic Middle Eastern food. Great shawerma, falafel, kibbeh, hommos, tabbouleh, baba ganosh and lentil soup. The ONLY place to go in Charlotte for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 4 years now. This is handsdown the best kabob place in charlotte. Dont come here for the ambience but for the food and the hospitality. 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"got to go!! everything is great. service super friendly. falafel wrap=best $5 sandwich anywhere in town. new extension says it all, business is booming and deservedly so."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Not sure why it took me this long to write a review!!! The service customer service is always great. I absolutely love the chicken shawarma!!! The chicken is cooked to perfection. I have also tried the mixed grill which come includes lamb, beef, soup or cucumber/tomato salad. You can't go wrong with anything you choose. I even had the steak and cheese and the chicken philly with fries........delicious. I will be back soon!!!l"}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant looks exactly like Gimli from Lord of the Rings, with his long red hair and beard, and he is such an awesome guy!  My family and I eat here regularly and he's always quick to greet us with a grin and a handshake.  It's a real family business, his daughters also work there. The food comes in generous portions at great prices.  I am pretty much addicted to their chicken shwarma dinner with veggie rice, but the falafel is amazing too.  The first time I ate there I told the owner I would definitely be back... he looked at me and said \"Praise Allah for you my friend!\"  Praise Allah indeed and go eat at La Shish Kebab!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Wonderfully vibrant place with mind-blowing flavor!  One of the best meals I've ever had.  Lamb shank, beautiful basmati? yellow rice that was cooked to perfection and the side dishes!  Wow.  I think I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern food!!  The gentleman who runs the place has a very warm and gracious spirit."}
{"text":"Every time I visit my family in Charlotte, we always seem to stumble upon some fun strip mall with a bunch nondescript ethnic restaurants. Last Monday afternoon was no different, and we found ourselves at La Shish Kebob.   As soon as we walked inside, we had a good feeling about the place. The guys behind the counter were jovial, the TV was blaring news in a language neither of us understood, and there were a ton of beverages in the fridge case that neither of us recognized.   My cousin got a lamb kebab wrap, and I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. We shared an app plate of hummus, kibbeh, and falafel.   Everything was just fantastic. The hummus was some of the best I've had, and the large pita was warm and fresh. The falafel was superb: crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and obviously fried to order. The kibbeh, which I'd never tried, was also outstanding: to me, it was like the Middle Eastern version of arancini, and I loved it. The meat was spiced well and the rice was not dry or crunchy.   Cousin loved his lamb kebab wrap; I enjoyed my shawarma wrap as well. The chicken was a little dry, but it wasn't anything the hot sauce, lemon-garlic sauce, and garlic mayo couldn't fix. It also came with fries, which were nothing spectacular, but went well with the garlic mayo (and really, you don't go to a kebab place for the fries!).   Price was more than reasonable and the portions were generous.   The service was also fantastic; not sure if the guy serving and ringing us up was the owner, but he was very nice and very enthusiastic about everything. We thanked him profusely before waddling our fat asses back to the car."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites.  Great mix of kabobs cooked on the grill to order, schwarma, rice, and salads.  It's not in the greatest area, but what good ethnic restaurant is?  I'll frequently drive 50 miles round trip to get carryout here.  Portions are huge, and even splitting with another person will leave you with leftovers for later.  Love the atmosphere, which reminds me of the real thing in the middle east.  Full of young Arabic families or groups of men picking apart roast chickens with their hands.  Arab TV channels on the telly.  Feels like you're in  Dubai.   Good bread from the Syrian bakery down the street.  Go there for freshest deserts.  Don't overeat, because the food is heavy in lamb fat-- which though delicious-- can be difficult on unfamiliar Western tummies.  Owner very friendly and helpful, as is everyone else who works there.  They really aim to please!"}
{"text":"Best food in town at great prices.  Lamb shank is excellent and lamb Philly best ever had.  Food is top quality and owner very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was bad. I understand that it is self service, but the man bussing the table was not friendly at all.  I merely asked for a take out box.  I had never been there before.  He pointed and said, \"they are over there, you get it\". I won't be returning.  I have been searching for a good middle eastern restaurant. The search continues."}
{"text":"This is some of the BEST food you will EVER taste.  The SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!!! No need to run down the list of their dishes I have had everything and its all done to PERFECTION!! From the prices to the portions this guy KNOWS how to treat a customer!"}
{"text":"It's open until midnight.  That alone makes me happy, but there is a lot to this little place other than keeping convenient hours. Maybe I'm hungry at 11 cause I didn't get a chance to eat earlier & don't feel like a high fructose corn patty from MickeyD's or some other fried abortion swimming in grease. Too harsh, I love bar food and late night Chinese, but sometimes I need something else that's open late besides, fast food or a Denny's. Something I won't completely regret eating.  Too much ranting about the inconsequential...again.  La Shish is a hole in the wall Mom & Pop establishment. There's no pretension, no linens, no giggling strumpets on dates with tall doofuses, just solid Middle Eastern food at reasonable prices. The simplest things are always the best. They serve up well seasoned grilled lamb, chicken and beef kabobs. Their fries are a meh minus, but I feel like an infidel getting them here anyway. Then there's my favorite refrain for any restaurant: the food is not oily or greasy.  As far as I know (which is not much), this could be the best shawarma and definitely the best tahini sauce in Charlotte. The \"shawarma wrap\" is not unlike the donner kebabs that are ubiquitous in many European countries that serve as their version of fast food, late night drunk munchie snack and hangover placebo. Fucking delicious. And definitely better tasting than fast food with REAL meat and REAL vegetables. I mean, they even cut the meat off of that big thing, you know, that big thing.  Fairly vegetarian friendly; I like a good falafel every now and again & they have one.  \"Okay my friend\" is what the owner behind the counter always says when your food is ready. This is a quickie joint, not a Michelin star place, so expect the service to be \"authentic\" as well."}
{"text":"great philly steak and fries gotta come again! i recommend this place to soul food lovers"}
{"text":"Very authentic resturant! You could smell the flavors the minute you walked in.. great steak and cheese philly.. they didnt put cheese on mine :(... but I did love the half chicken with rice.. saved my life of hunger ab few times. Happy camper. I cant say that im the biggest fan of trying the diffrent foods they offer but I like to look at them."}
{"text":"Talk about authentic! The owners are from Jerusalem, and there's a tiny menu board at the front of the shop, where menu items are spelled out in Arabic in bright chalk.    Prices are super cheap, and you get a lot of food.   There isn't much ambiance here, and that's OK.  It's a small joint in a strip center featuring some ethnic food marts and just down the street are some check-cashing shops. It's an easily overlooked restaurant. There are also no formal menus, just paper fold-out ones.   The falafel here truly is one of the best I've had in Charlotte.  Very crispy and not too herbacious (Kabob Grill is one of my faves, but the falafel can sometimes be too green inside.) The falafel wrap is only $3! It comes with tahini and some slivers of red onion. The 8 pieces for our appetizer were just $3.99.   I got the hommous and shwarma platter with the house salad.  The salad of thinly shredded lettuce, cucumbers, red onion and dressing was a nice pairing to the rich and creamy hommous in olive oil. The dish (photo enclosed) was enormous and $7.99.   BTW: You can buy an entire roast chicken (a-la Costco style) seasoned with their own mix of herbs and spices, for $7.99!  For $24, you can get a 4 piece meal to take home, which features 2 whole chickens!   What I loved was the variety of people who walked through the doors during my lunch.  Police officers, men in business suits, small kids.    Keep in mind, there is no sweet tea/iced tea.  Just canned sodas, some juices and drinks written in Arabic, and waters.    In addition to dessert (which was a pisachio pastry in flaky phyllo, not as sticky and over sweet as baklava...just the right portion size, about the size of a half-dollar coin) they sell meat pastries and buns.   I'm not in this neighborhood often, but when the craving for Middle Eastern strikes, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious! Two lamb shanks combo! Never finished it in a single meal! Very clean! The stuffs are so kind! The guy with a red cap all the time is so shy and funny! BTW, you can't miss the jalapeño spicy sauce. It is spicy but very delicious! A special smell that can make you feel fresh and comfortable."}
{"text":"Meh, above average Middle Eastern food. Everything was way too salty including the Hummous. The chicken Shawarma looked so sad and it was so dry it tasted like it's been hanging on the rotating spit for decades."}
{"text":"Tons-o-Rice.  My favorite is the kalfta and the lamb shank. The place looks sketchy and not a lot of seats cause it's mainly a take-out restaurant, but you won't regret going there.  I question the desserts that's just laying on the counter where flies can get to. The lemon/ oil salad dressing needs some tweaking, it lacks in flavor. Over all nice place for some hardy mid east food.   I'd eat it. I'd eat it goooood."}
{"text":"great food first time I try Shawarma but it was good"}
{"text":"We have been eating here at least a couple times a month since moving to Charlotte and I've never had a bad meal. The lamb shank is great and the lentil soup is amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes food."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food, but then again in Dearborn Michigan there's incredible Lebanese food that's hard to beat! It wasn't terrible but I hope to find somewhere better and don't go there for the ambiance."}
{"text":"The best mediterranean food I've tasted yet in Charlotte. We come here regularly to eat and the owner is pretty nice.  My favs: lentil soup, lamb shank, mixed kabob, yellow rice."}
{"text":"First of all, amazing service. I mean AMAZING. The owner is literally always there, checking up on you, making sure you are enjoying everything. Second of all, the food. The lamb shanks are fall of the bone tender, the half chicken is always juicy and flavorful, the gyros are simply perfection. I love this place with all of my food loving soul. Of all the places I eat in this city, La Shish Kabob is my favorite. It's a little fun hole in the wall, with out of this world food and service. Food from the holy land is what the owner tells me, all I can say is keep doing what you are doing sir, and you forever have a happy customer in me."}
{"text":"Food was fresh,  fast, and had large portions. The place reminds me of joints I frequented in New York. Will be back. I had the kafta and lentil soup. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"What can I say that already has not been said? Everything we have ever eaten there is kick*ss. So if you ever go to another \"Middle Eastern\" food joint, beware. This place sets a high standard. This is the only place we would eat at in Charlotte. Well, we did go to the Penguin when it was good, but then it changed management... Anyway, grab a bite here. You will probably come back a few days later, it is that good. The lamb on rice, OMG. It is a huge portion, so go in hungry. And the flavor is like no other, incredible. The Fattoush salad is amazing. Get the Family Meal and go for a picnic then play some disc golf and go back and get the Lamb Shank. Well worth the drive from Cornelius. We miss this joint."}
{"text":"Love the NY style shawarma!  Owner is so inviting and welcoming, and the food is fantastic.  The lentil soup is amazing with the garlic mayo.  I've had many a shawarma and this dish was divine.  If I lived in Charlotte I would ve getting take out from here weekly."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. They expanded and I felt like the quality went down. The dishes became drier and lacking of flavor. The staff is super friendly and very fast how ever. I ordered the kabobs and the chicken and the lamb shanks. There was a lot of food and good size portions however flavors were lacking. A lot of the meat was also to dry."}
{"text":"Very legit! I've been trying to go here for awhile, but live closer to my favorite Kabob Je, another delicious place. I was stuck at home and saw La Shish Kabob on Uber Eats and figured it's time to give them a shot.  All I can say is wow! I don't think I've ever had better hummus or shwarma. Simply fantastic, and the skewers were expertly seasons. My favorite Mediterranean restaurant now has competition."}
{"text":"Try to place an order and the spanish speaking man who was trying to get the order was rude by telling me to hurry up with the order because he was busy.."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here with a friend and I will absolutely be back. I loved the hummus - excellent!  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars - the music was so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation. Please turn the music down!"}
{"text":"All around excellent taste, excellent pricing and quality. The owner is a hard worker and always present taking care of every customer.  Very special place for a great meal and generous portions. A Must Visit Spot."}
{"text":"This place is hopping and the owner handles the lines of people just like a boss! He gets your order and tells you to take a seat... with 100% accuracy (even while talking on the phone) he brings you your food hot and fresh! You can opt for an AYCE buffet or choose from 20 different menu options and bottled beverages. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Turkish coffee and falafel! He can't wait to go back.. he's been craving it ever since."}
{"text":"Newest dining obsession. Everything is amazing. The owner is so sweet and has come out to greet us each time. Falafel = amazing. Baba ghanouj = amazing. Tomato cucumber salad...AMAZING. They do a mixed grill platter that's enough meat and rice and salad to share between two, but I do recommend an extra side order of baba ghanouj because you will regret it if you don't get it. I'm always looking for another excuse to eat there again."}
{"text":"You can see this place in little old strip mall on Sharon Amity Rd. You can't  tell what gem is in the inside by looking at the place outside.   When you go inside, WOW! it's  a rainbow of food, flavors and authentic Middle Eastern music. I can only say that the food is fantastic.  If you are a Middle Eastern food lover this is the place for you. uou get for a cheap price a great meal.  Don't  expect service, it a do it yourself type of place. The owner is always here, friendly and helpful. Saturdays and Sundays they have a great mini buffet. Definitely it's worth the trip. Let's eat! Yummy."}
{"text":"The fooooooood! It's actually been a long while since I've eaten here and and I tell you, I've been missing out! The biggest change I've noticed is that they are now seasoning their kabobs. Although it was still delicious, I used to have to add salt to the kabobs, not anymore...thank goodness. Delish."}
{"text":"Location, sketchy. Food, phenomenal. This place is one of the defining reasons why I LOVE Mediterranean food. The spices, herbs, meat, EVERYTHING is incredibly fresh. I had quite the sampling of food so I did get a good idea of the beautiful things this place is capable of. Even with the large sampling the bill was quite reasonable.  If you're a fan of Mediterranean food or you just love great food this is a great place to get some of the freshest and most flavorful food you'll ever have."}
{"text":"So darn good. I get the lamb shanks every time. Huge pieces of meat dripping off the bone. They just expanded the restaurant so now there's a lot more room for dining."}
{"text":"My first visit and I ordered food to-go. The smells coming from the grill were unreal. I opted for the app sampler (I picked hommus, stuffed grape leaves, and kibbeh), a small order of the falafel, and a combo shish kabob plate with rice and salad. The only item I had ever had before was the grape leaves and hommus. It was life changing! Kibbeh is my new favorite food. They look like giant hush puppies but are stuffed with meat and almonds and a mind-blowing amount of flavor. The rice was delicious and the grilled meats on top were perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Ok! so, the price on the menu board doesn't match with the price that I've been charged, the amount of food was good but I noticed a piece of metal in the Taboli plate, where did it come from, i think from the dish washing materials, so I went to report the problem and all what i got is an angry face from the owner that does most of the stuff usually and I even saw him earlier standing with his shoes on the dining table to fix the ceiling fan, and finally I wasn't impressed with the way they deal with customers and they charged me for water also."}
{"text":"Went in to try something new. Got the ground beef wrap per suggestion. Noticed the buffet was set up..I was told it was so popular during Ramadan that it's offered everyday now! $14.95 from 1pm-10pm. Yay!!! I will be back for that."}
{"text":"This food is addictive. If I could put the baba gonoush in my veins, I would, it's so flavorful. I loved the beef kebabs and get the lentil soup as your side, so good."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb shanks, with a side of cucumber salad. The order is not just 1 lamb shank, but 2, and they were good sized shanks.  Falling off the bone good, seasoned so well I decided not to add anything to them. In a fancier restaurant in a different location that alone would be $30 or more, but here it was about $12. This was my first time there, but it's going to be a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim and very glad we did. Great attitude, atmosphere and good food. I had beef kabob and rice and likely will not change that for my next visit. Cant wait!"}
{"text":"The owner is so nice!!! The veggie combo is delicious. La shish kabob is my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always get the chicken kabob which comes with lentil soup or salad. Delicious!!! A little more expensive than jasmine grill across town but a great alternative when on the East side. Don't interpret the gruff nature of the owner as rude just enjoy your delicious meal."}
{"text":"I found the place very unhygenic. The main guy who was catering was literally stinking. I ordered Turkish Adana kebob. It was just plain stinking. I couldn't eat even a bit of it. We just left. The place is extremely unkept and unhygienic."}
{"text":"They have best lamb in town. Highly recommended. Good service clean place. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"great and fresh food.  the prices are ok not that sheap."}
{"text":"The food was so good!!! It was fresh,  seasoned great and piping !!!!Service was ok but the food......GREAT!"}
{"text":"The chicken was moist.  The portion are good for the price."}
{"text":"All I've ever had here are Falafels to go, and an occasional bite from my husband's chicken shawarma. They're good. And at less than four dollars, fine for the money. That's about it. No excellence, but when I want a cheap meal that isn't a traditional sandwich, I'll always be happy to go back there. The Tabouleh is veeerry lemony - some like it that way, I personally don't.   The owner is very friendly, and when I was digging for cash the other day, he offered that I could just pay next time I came in. Five stars on the service."}
{"text":"The food is authentic, fresh and delicious. Came all the way from high Point and it was well worth it :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Middle East deli in Charlotte.    Food is fantastic, prices are unbelievably low and the owner makes you feel like family.  Seating is limited due to the deli style.  I usually call ahead for take out."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those places that make me grateful for Yelp, because I never would have found it without it. I would give it 5 stars for service, value, grilled kabobs, buttery delicious baklava and hommos.  The chicken was really well-seasoned and perfectly cooked (often kabobs can be burnt and cardboardy). We were really pleased with our meals that were so reasonably priced.  What deducted a star for me is the odd deli ambiance with trays of food sitting out as well as the baba ghanoush which missed the mark for me. Perhaps it is the traditional way they prepare it in Jerusalem, but I prefer the more Greek/Morroccan way with more eggplant/lemon than creamy white stuff. Yeah, I said it. No creamy white stuff for me. (Good thing I'm never running for office.)  I got three pieces of baklava for the office mates to go which were a major crowd pleaser. They were more buttery than typical Greek baklava than I've had, but I really enjoyed it.   A great alternative if you're stuck in the midlands of Charlotte at a car dealership and your food tank is running on empty. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, although be specific if calling it in, they will charge you twice the price for a combo if not.  I'd give this place its 5th star if they weren't so eager to charge me $11 for a $6 kabob.  It does come with a bunch of rice and a little side salad, but all they would have to do is clarify with me what I wanted and we'd be cool.  I will just ask for a total next time."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in NC great food their lamp shanks and half chicken with rice is amazing, the owner is very friendly , Shawera is amazing and prices are very very reasonable every time I go to Charlotte I have to pay a visit to la shish Kabob"}
{"text":"Have tried other expensive kabob places in Charlotte and this one is as good, if not better.  Stopped in for lunch for a chicken kabob wrap and a side of tabouli.  Both were excellent  and the place was busy at lunch.  New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Got there at 10:45 they watch me and my brother look at the menu and all only to tell us 10 minutes later that they are closed, thought they were opened to midnight ? some other guys looked and giggled . . . The worst. Dont even try that crap anymore"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding here, the best Middle Eastern/Halal I've had in Charlotte. We had several dishes -- hummus and pita, falafel, kafta, beef shawarma, meat pies. All first rate. The salads are fresh and very well prepared as well. Service is fast, the owner/manager is a great guy, and the prices are inexpensive. The space itself is pretty pedestrian -- think late-night diner -- but it is clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I was was visiting Charlotte for a business purpose while find this place in Yelp. Thought let's  try.    I ordered Lamb Shank and rice. It was the most delicious shank I have ever tried.    Khalidon was very respectful and friendly person. He served the foods very nicely.   I wish to go again and again."}
{"text":"I love middle east and lamb shank and special rices they are awesome and more flavors. That place is champ and love to go there again.yummy!!!! Chat with deaf socially"}
{"text":"always delicious. super friendly service. great to see a restaurant expand and be a cultural hub. gotta get me some garlic mayo and falafel."}
{"text":"The owner, the guy behind the counter, has hit it out of the park. I am impressed. The food is a huge portion - plenty for two full size adults. The atmosphere is clean and family friendly. I enjoyed all of it and will certainly be coming here from in on out. We ordered a plate of lamb Kevin with a side of rice and cucumber salad - it was excellent, we also ordered a side of small hummus, it was huge and turned out to be far too much food for us both. They're open until midnight because they're running their buts off until then. It was 10 pm when we left but people were still coming in the door on a Friday night. I would have provided pictures but the food was too good to waste time with the camera. Very affordable, very comfortable."}
{"text":"Wholly crap, I am kicking myself for taking so long to find and check out this place. Long have I been starved and roaming the streets of Charlotte for a middle eastern and/or Mediterranean eatery like La Shish Kabob.  Between the fact that it's not in the best part of town and that Sharon Amity is a construction zone at the moment may dissuade you from checking it out, but you will thank me if you do. It's nothing fancy to look at from the outside or inside, but there  are a few tables both in both areas. Otherwise it's basically like a really small deli type shop with a register and a display case and open kitchen area. While they have a full menu of middle eastern and Mediterranean delicacies, I have only had the Schwarma meal on both of my visits. The wife has tried the falafel and veggie plate I believe. The garlic sauce that comes with the Schwarma is amazing and the spices in the chicken are spot on. I really need to force myself to try something else. We sat down inside on our second visit and the smells from the plates on the other tables making me hungry all over again.  Many return visits to come and eventually, I will make it through the whole menu."}
{"text":"La Shish Kabob is not going to win any awards for décor or atmosphere, but the food is good and solid.  The owner is very helpful if you ask for suggestions or if you want something made special.    I knew that I had to try the falafel since I had read on other reviews that their falafel is really good.  So, I ordered a falafel wrap and a bowl of lentil soup.   Both were very solid, but not better than what I can get at the Kabob Grill in Stonecrest.  However, the pricing at La Shish Kabob is much cheaper.   So, if you are looking for good solid food at great prices, I would definitley recommend La Shish Kabob"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The owner is super nice and I believe many members of his family work here too. The food is so delicious!  Lamb Shania and shawerma with humus. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for falafel and that didn't disappoint, but I ordered takeout and part of my order was missing. Other than that, the food that I got was amazing. The greek salad is delicious even though I asked for no feta cheese."}
{"text":"Great resturant ! Great people ! And great atmosphere!  The food is so fresh !  First time here and I will be back here for sure"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing!!! The owner is super nice and greets all guests as they come through the door. We had the baba ghannouj, lentil soup, lamb skewers, and Turkish coffee. Everything was so flavorful. The lamb was tender and so delicious!!  And the Turkish coffee was among the best I've had. We will be back."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Charlotte I have been craving a tasty, dirt cheap falafel sandwich. I had recently caught wind that this neighborhood was blossoming with Middle Eastern choices, and La Shish Kebob was exactly what I had been hoping for. For $3 you get a decent (not generous but also not stingy) serving of falafel surrounded by tomatoes, mint (at least I could have sworn it was mint), tahini, onion, pickled cucumbers and peppers. All of it is wrapped like a burrito in a pita bread. Could it have used a healthy dose of hot sauce (and I don't mean the Texas Pete they had sitting on the table), yes. but it was utterly delicious without.   The restaurant is pretty standard for a strip mall outpost. I stayed to eat but that was just because I didn't trust myself to make it home without digging in. The gentleman behind the counter was helpful and let me know that they didn't have takeout menus in yet but they would on Monday. That's good news because as soon as I got home I was checking to see if I can make it to La Shish Kebob and back on my lunch hour...I can!"}
{"text":"One of the most delicious middle-eastern restaurants. The food is amazing and decent prices.Customer service is gorgeous.. Im from middle-east and as much food as I tried I can tell this is one of the top on my list. Give it a try and you'll know what I mean"}
{"text":"I'm middle eastern and of course i can tell if a middle eastern restaurant is good or not..food here is really good! And staff members are very nice...will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"I am a picky Mediterranean/ Arab food diner, but I gotta say that some of their selections are just off the hook! i.e. their chicken and beef kabob skewers over the yellow rice, lentil soup, cucumber and tomato salad. And the price you pay for the portion you get is a steal!   Having that said, I like the yellow rice more than their orange (or what they call the \"special\" rice), and I think the yellow rice should actually be the special rice, but oh well, whatever floats their boat.   The dessert is okay, but I don't really come here for dessert. Their food is just soooo filling for me, and it just makes my day.  ***A tip for everyone: I have noticed that if you take out and taking a long drive home, the food won't taste as great (but still decently good) as it originally was piping hot because some selections of the food may dry up. But this is not the owner's or the restaurant's fault, it's just common sense for some foods when you take out.   The ambiance/ aesthetics of this place are not great, but it's a small fast food place almost, and I really just go there for a delicious and filling meal.   Staff is friendly but not overly. The guy who owns the place has long red hair and does look like he is straight out of the Hobbit, but the only thing is he is not too friendly when there is a rush."}
{"text":"Absolutely marvelous!!!  My husband & I had passed by several times and said we needed to try it as our favorite Middle Eastern restaurant closed several months ago.  As mentioned in other reviews, it is a very small restaurant and the ambience is non-existent but this is not even noticeable because of the friendliness of the people and the quality of the food.  We got the appetizer combo and chose houmos, falafel and stuffed grape leaves.  We also got the kabob combo which came with two sides; we chose a wonderful salad and fries - the fries were average but with the amount of food, it didn't matter.  We also sampled the rice which is another choice of sides - not special but good.  The food is very, very reasonable and we will defintely be back.  We decided that besides the houmos (the best I've ever had), our favorites were the falafel and the chicken kabob.  This place is hidden in a nondescript strip mall. I hope it survives."}
{"text":"That place used to have very good food but not really good customer service.. But that last time I was there, the food was very bad and a very bad customer service.. No napkins on the table... They just have a sink to wash your hands before and after you eat.. But hey! You still have to find your own trash can to throw away the paper towels because they don't have one"}
{"text":"The food quality is very good at LA Shish Kabob. I ordered the mixed grill plate with chicken, beef, and lamb over rice. Very yummy and great quality.  I also ordered the Vegetarian plate with hummus, falafel, salad and some other purée substance that was yummy. The falafel was either not fresh or fried too hard and was crumby. Other than that the food was great and I recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, a welcoming atmosphere and great service. I don't review often but I had to for this spot! Huuuuge portions and incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"I had been frequenting La shish Kabob. Their lentil soup is homemade perfection, their vegetarian combo a delight, and their pistachio baklava is just amazing.delicious kefta too."}
{"text":"First time there, friendly service, food was ok. Get the lentil soup and call it a day."}
{"text":"Best hummus we have found since we lived in LA.   I don't even finish saying La Shish Kabob for dinner ? Before the answer is yes!  I can walk there but you should make the drive !"}
{"text":"Their lamb shanks are out of this world, like fall off the bone and lick my plate good. This place is a treasure!!"}
{"text":"Update: They have updated their menu and resturant!! Love this place!! It doesn't look like much but it always great whenever we go. Especially when they have their buffet available. We always get their chicken biriani, humus and lentil soup. The staff is so welcoming and extremely helpful when you can't decide what to get. We will definitely come back since they're always up late. We got the rice and beef plate. Absolutly delicious!"}
{"text":"It's been a year since I last dined here,  and although today was a 2 go order,  I still think this is some of the best middle eastern food around.   The lamb shacks are so tender and tasty and the aroma . . . so challenging not to munch on the way home.   Tip:  put the food on the floor behind your seat so you won't be tempted.  Also,  around 4 pm the parking is plentiful: easy-peasy in/out."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good with generous servings. Favorite: grilled chicken with special rice, very flavorful, fresh (no meat freezing from my understanding, that's why it tastes sooo good) Service is great, very friendly. I don't usually write reviews but I have to give props to this diamond in the ruff."}
{"text":"This place gets it.  \"It\" being the understanding that cheap food can be fresh and tasty.  And that is what makes people come back.  I am by no means a falafel lover, but after trying one of this places (thanks to my wife ordering it), it might be what I get next time.  Don't bother getting the wrap, get the appetizer (8 balls of goodness vs 3 for the same price.  Knowledge happily shared by the owner himself, love that).  Get the hummus too, it is quite tasty.  I had the mixed kabob platter - the chicken and lamb were nice, tender and flavorful.  I wasn't a huge fan of the ground beef one.  Hard to beat the bang for the buck you get at La Shish Kabob."}
{"text":"Hello, new found \"one of my favorite\" restaurants. My wallet thanks you, as well as my belly and tastebuds. I'm tempted to go there for lunch a second day in a row...it was that tasty!  If you're looking for a casual place with authentic food, you'll want to check out  La Shish Kabob! It has a little bit of Middle Eastern decor inside, but you don't go for the ambiance...you go for the delicious cuisine!   To start, we got the veggie combo: hummus, baba ganoush, and grape leaves. It comes with fresh sliced pita bread. Really after eating that plate, we were practically full. Next came our sandwiches: falafel and a chicken shawarma. The falafel was perfect! Crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside and seasoned to perfection. Halfway through the sandwich I knew I was stuffed, but my mouth didn't want to stop eating because of the flavor. For dessert we shared one baklava. It was pretty good. I prefer it made with pistachios, but this type was made with walnuts or pecans.  There are approximately 5 tables, but if you don't want to stay, plenty of people were ordering \"to go.\" This place was steady during lunch. One of the best things about this place, besides the quality of the food, is the price...we left under $20 including tip!   We will definitely return...probably as early as today...see you there!"}
{"text":"Two words: yummy and authentic. It's a small, family-friendly place. I've never eaten there but there are only about 7 tables. However, the food is fresh  and made to order. Its so good. The hummus is the best I've had in the city."}
{"text":"One of the places that I have to visit every time I come home to Charlotte. Cheap eats and great food. The falafel is my favorite. Got 2 falafel wraps and fries for $8.99. They've expanded since my last time there so it's not as crowded. Haven't found anything in Atlanta that compares to this yet."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place and I have fallen in love!! I order two entrees: mixed grill and Cornish hen.  Both meals were more than enough food. Everything was cooked perfectly and flavored very well. I loved loved eating every single bite! It took me a few days to eat all of it. These leftovers are the best."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and the lamb wrap was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is the best in town, I went their last week to get lunch and It was great. the Shawerma meal tastes so god with the garlic sauce I loved it. they were pretty busy since I came around iftar time in Ramadan. the gentleman behind the counter was super freindly I think his name was Ibrahim, he offered me Baklawa while waiting for my ordered. I love this place and I will return soon, I recommened it to all food lovers!!"}
{"text":"Great moist flavorful shawarma .  Rice is a little oily but good.  Baba ghanoush was devine.  The tomatoe & cucumber salad was minty and fresh."}
{"text":"Very regular customers to this place.  Wife and I love Mediterranean food and found this jewel in the city and so glad we did.  The owner is such a friendly person, greets every time we go there and its so genuine and welcoming.  ok the food, obviously they have great shawrmas, falafels, hummus, various kabobs, baklava etc., but to me the one thing that stands out is the Lamb Shank.  God damn, yes its fatty, full of cholesterol and thousands of calories but trust me, it is worth everything.  I always have the Lamb Shanks with Maklouba rice, not always but as often as possible.  We usually get the whole chicken and rice or chicken kabobs for dinner.  They have expanded recently and have a much bigger dining space than few months before. All this for a very very decent price, its the best Mediterranean place around."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. The best food of its kind in Charlotte. I eat here very often because no establishment in town make shwarma anywhere near as good."}
{"text":"Local Middle Eastern eats! You seriously cannot beat La Shish Kabob. It is inexpensive, fast and DELICIOUS! Their lentil soup and vegetable/special rice are the best things in the house. Their lamb shanks are a close second. The location is a bit on the seedy side, but it is worth the detour. Lots of regular eaters at La Shish; it is that good! What are you waiting for? GO!"}
{"text":"Went there today with 4 colleagues, one of which is from Jordan. The food was hearty and delicious. I suggest as a rule getting the special of the day or a couple of the sides. The kunafa was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service, classic Arabic food and atmosphere. Had the chicken shawarma wrap, Greek salad, kafta wrap, and lamb wrap.  All were pretty tasty.   At least I saw fresh being made stuff, I'm not sure if I'm missing it or there really isn't any amazing middle eastern places in general in NC, but so far the best middle eastern place I have tried in NC.   I will be back again to try some different items."}
{"text":"Love, love, love La Shish Kabob! Food is delicious and the atmosphere is a hoot. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while on a business trip. Got the chicken shwarama plate and it was outstanding. Chicken was flavored well and they give lots of it. Really liked their garlic sauce as well. Had enough for lunch and dinner. Owner is a really nice guy as well. Not the biggest place, but they serve good food."}
{"text":"This place is so great I have it on speed dial! My go to is the chicken kabobs with rice and salad."}
{"text":"Food looks smells and tastes great. The service is great, and the prices are great. The portions are great. And for some reason this place reminds me of living in NYC. Anyway, I've been to this place 3 times already in the past 2 weeks. It's now my go-to for lunch on days i work from home. So far I've tried the lamb philly, the fries, lamb shank, yellow rice, plantain soup, and felafel."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!!!  The owner is waiting on you with more enthusiasm and friendliness than you could imagine.  OPEN Kitchen is a big plus!  Huge Dessert display in Dessert Fridge!   The flavor of everything was good.  If you like mild and I don't mean spicy hot or mild, though nothing was spicy hot either.  The Turkish Coffee was A-OK.  Lamb Shank, was super tender fell off the bone and had a nice flavor, the Tabouleh, Baklava, Special Rice, were way too plain.  The Beef Shish Kabob was the only item that had a zing to it and I would give it a 3.5 yelp stars, everything else I got was 3 stars or less.   Everything was much milder than I'm used to, which I say because some probably prefer it this mild."}
{"text":"The best lamb in Charlotte! Everything was so flavorful and delicious, go here and do your tastebuds a favor lol."}
{"text":"Really Loved dinner here.  Did pick up on a particularly busy night so I didn't mind the wait. There were three guys killings themselves to be timely and get to everyone and I am grateful for the hustle despite the wait.   We ordered the 3 appetizer combo with falafel, grape leaves and hummus.  And shared the Mixed Grill plate.  Perfect for two and even was able to take some for lunch!    The food was warm, fresh and the flavors were everything we wanted!  Thank you for a great dinner experience. Can't wait to come back and try the all you can eat Buffett ($15) or more food!"}
{"text":"Four stars +  A year and over three dozen meals later I'm raising its rating. No, not everything is perfect, that doesn't happen anywhere but the food consistently more flavorful than it has right to be for a falafel joint - I suspect the owner is a foodie himself.   Usually with Arabic food I'm not drawn to meat dishes primarily, La Shish being the exception. I really like the Adana kabob, the mixed grill with special rice is a meat eater delight, even the chicken shwarma made me go like Larry David : \"don't know what the Palestinian did with the chicken but it's out of this world!\" Well, no it's not but it's really really good.   I recommend sharing a Foul Madamas appetizer, the taste always bring a smile to my face. I usually take home a container of their humus, priced like supermarket crap but so much better.  One thing: made without preservatives so you really want to eat within a few days.    The local Muslim community fully supports the restaurant  and it does a brisk business (Friday after prayer is a zoo in there!) but in spite of the many positive reviews I rarely if ever saw fellow gringos or gringas eating there.   We've never felt anything less than 110% safe eating there ourselves, but I did hear otherwise from locals so I'll end with this caveat: For adventure tourists only !   Not recommended for the tour bus or all inclusive cruise crowd.  8^P"}
{"text":"I love La Shish. The food is consistently great and it comes at a good price. It is open until midnight most nights. I recommend the shawarma with hummus and the desserts are delicious also. My only complaint is not enough seating sometimes."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times over the last month. The first time, I ordered the mixed kabob platter with chicken kabob, kofta kabob, and shish kabob. The portion sizes were huge, and the meal even came with lentil soup. The food itself was ok, as far as Mediterranean food goes. The meats were on the dry side, and the rice tasted a bit stale. The lentil soup was creamy and delicious though.   I ordered the chicken shwarma wrap the second time. Chicken was dry, and the wrap included pickle slices as well (which I didn't expect). I was hoping for lettuce/tomato in the wrap...oh well  The inside of the restaurant is kinda small, so it might not fit a large table of people, but if you are dining with a few people, the space should be sufficient."}
{"text":"The first time coming here with my parents for a dinner, they arrived first and they thought this wasn't even a restaurant. Walking in, it seemed as if it was a small shop, a grocery store even. Instead they had tables and a kitchen with pictures of food and the tv channel set on a foreign news channel.   The first thought came to me as: 'Hm. This should be an interesting experience.' As the manager, or owner, came out he was very nice. He showed us the specials for the day as well as gave us menus. And the menu items, well lets just say it was pretty cheap. When the food came out (I bought a rotisserie chicken) the portions were plentiful. The rice wasn't the usual rice I usually eat, but it was mixed with spices and a little dry (that's the way the rice is supposed to be cooked) and it tasted awesome.  We also ordered the lintel soup, which was also good. At the price, no wonder why people love this place. There wasn't a ton of options on the menu, but as people say \"quality, not quantity\" this place really defines it. However the quantity of the food that comes out on the main dish is plentiful.  However, there are some things to keep in mind when you come here to eat. They don't have 'free' water when you eat there. It isn't a bad thing, but when the prices are that low, it's understandable. And also, this place is definitely a take-out restaurant. Call in, take an order (or go there and make an order) and enjoy at work or wherever the day takes you.   Overall though, I couldn't decide to give it a 4 or 5. I want to give it a 5, but I think I'll have to come here several more times to get me to scaled to that level. Next time I come though, I'll definitely bring my own water!"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Ny Shish, Chi Shish, Hou Shish, or even Sf Shish, this is the Los Angeleno version of this excellent Middle Eastern food spot.  Excellent babaganoush and some great dishes here. A really good example of yummy Middle Eastern food and although service can be a little gruff and questionable, I still recommend coming here. There were some really spectacular girls in here the day I was here as well. I was very happy they were open on Thanksgiving because the last several places I tried were not."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hot spots for Kabobs and Mediterranean food. We tried their lamb shank and  cornish hen and what can I say, everything is delishhh and on point!  Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I am not completely a meat and potatoes type of girl thus I am more drawn to sharwarma with pickles and greens but I have to say the meat was good. I also ordered hummus which was also good. A little on the chunkier side which is not everyone's favorite. Note they have a lunch buffet which is great way to try a variety of traditional Arabic dishes especially if you are a newbie to Arabic cuisine."}
{"text":"If you love kabobs and gyros/middle Eastern food...this place is a bit too bland and everyday. The chicken shawarma was super dry and it definitely needed more sauce. The falafels were dry and not flavorful and the lamb gyro was decent. You will find better gyros on east boulevard or even the little village grill. The owner was super nice and friendly but not worth going out of your way at all"}
{"text":"Delicious I ordered the chicken kabobs, hummus and falafel balls all of which were well seasoned, fresh and authentic. You can tell the owners or the establishment take pride in the product they are serving and the freshness! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love, love, love.... I cannot emphasize how much I love this place!   The food is amazing & always fresh. The owner is awesome & will literally know each of his patrons by name.    When I call just the sound of my voice he'll greet me by name & read off my order based off of memory. I always order the Greek salad & skewers of chicken. It's absolutely delish. Now try that w/ the tahini (garlic sauce) & you will be in Food heaven.   Great good. Great service. All around nice spot! I'm a huge foodie & would recommend this to any & everyone."}
{"text":"I always see La Shish Kabob in passing and wanted to give it a try.I recently ordered from here not too long ago and did not like my food at all.I ordered the chicken shawrama.It was quite bland despite the seasoning I could see on the food.It was also on the pricey side for what was given which I did not find to be reasonable.I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of Charlotte's best in my opinion.  The location is in the rugged N. Sharon Amity Rd & Albermarle Rd area, but is surrounded by other restaurants and markets catering to the Middle Eastern community.  The food is reasonably priced and tastes superb.  The Turkish coffee is well worth a try as well, although don't expect it to be similar to your run of the mill stuff --- which is precisely why it's good.  I've been here 3 times, but only been able to eat there twice.  Before going the first time, I called to make sure they would be open late and was told they would be open until 11pm (not midnight like on the Yelp page).  When we got there all of the chairs and tables were outside and they were ripping up the floor and they were obviously closed for the evening.  This was at 10pm on Valentine's day, but while we were disappointed we were still undeterred.  The next couple times we had the tabbouleh which was quite good, but like another poster said it is pretty lemony and also has a lot more liquid in it than one's I've previously had.  It is still very good though.  It comes with a pita, but we had to remind the guy the first time after which he gave us one pita (not enough) and the second time we automatically got two.     We also had the combination kebab plate with rice which was really good.  The second time we went my GF really wanted the rice (she loved it) and asked the guy if he could just sell us some rice, but he said that he couldn't and that since he isn't the owner he couldn't make the choice.  (we secretly wondered about that since he's always there and sometimes has his family there! haha, but oh well!)  The hummus/hommos is also good.  We also had a schwarma and a falafel our second time eating there and really liked them both.  Our Middle Eastern friend who joined us was a little ambivalent to it all so I still am not sure what he thought of it.  A lot of Middle Easterners frequent this place which is a good sign.  I really liked the food and I am dying to go back.  The people are hospitable and the prices reasonable.  The place's decor is no frills, but when the food is that good you don't need to dress things up."}
{"text":"Very good!  Authentic, cheap, and fast.  I could basically live off the lentil soup, and that's just a side item.  Check out the whole lamb shanks!"}
{"text":"Since I've moved to Charlotte three years ago (from southeastern Michigan), I have been in search of a place like this.  I have settled for mediocre Middle Eastern places in Charlotte to satisfy my cravings, but now La Shish Kabob is here for fresh, flavorful, reasonably priced Mediterranean cuisine.  I came in on a whim during Ramadan.  The place was packed with families seated at tables connected together who were served family-style.  They were beyond busy, and I should've known better.  I came just at the moment they were all breaking fast.  In the midst of waiters rushing to serve their guests, a friend of the owners (I presumed) got up and took my order preceded by an offering to try a fig...which I took.  Yum.  They later offered me a stuffed grape leaf while I was waiting for my order.  Double yum.  I ordered a sampling of food: falafel, kibbeh, chicken shwarma, hommos, baba ghanouj, and three honey-coated pastries that had a cream filling.  Everything was tasty, subtle flavors of fresh herbs, large portions, very filling...yummy leftovers.  So, Charlotteans, let's keep this new eatery open.  Try it out.  You won't be disappointed. It's worth it, I promise.    If you're new to Middle Eastern cuisine, this will be a great introduction. Looking for a new take out to bring home that won't burn a whole in your wallet?  This is your place.  You are also looking for the \"real deal\"? Head there now : )"}
{"text":"I have lunch here 4 of the past 5 days. Only missed four because I was not in the area. Great authentic food, awesome atmosphere, and the staff is amazing! Next week I am shooting for 5/5 lunches there. :):)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing prices and everyone was so helpful. They walked us through the menu and explained everything. The veggie plate was great and so was the Gyro Lamb."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews, but I had to this time!  We just moved to Charlotte from Northern VA, and I was skeptical of finding good middle eastern food that rivaled our local favorites back home. I am pleased to say this one was even better.  The location was a little out of the way for us and due to traffic, we almost turned around, but I'm so glad we didn't.  The owner and staff was very friendly and the prices are so affordable! I got the chicken shawarma platter and my husband got the mixed grill platter (lamp, beef, chicken). I tend to find the meat in most middle eastern dishes, while flavorful, is often a bit dry and I couldn't believe how tender everything was! The salad that came with is was so good and fresh, and the flavors were amazing. Great sauces too.  We will definitely be coming back, as I'm not sure I will be trying any other places after finding this one!"}
{"text":"I come down to Charlotte often to visit family and friends. LA shish kabob is the first place I make sure to hit up before anything else!  I travel all around the states and I havnt tasted food so authentic and tasty! Thanks LA shish kabob for always sending me home so satisfied!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We drive well across town to partake in some delicious, well marinated and perfectly cooked chicken kabobs, beef, goat, lamb... kefta, pilaf, hummus, falafel. It's all good. The owner is very friendly too. In an unremarkable shopping center but excellent and worth the trip. Husband and I usually order the mixed meat plate of three kabobs, (you can pick whatever he has that day - comes with pilaf and small salad ), hummus plate and falafel which is plenty of food and usually enough for lunch the next day too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food is made fresh every day, and I have never had better falafel or hummus, anywhere.  I get the falafel wrap once or sometimes twice a week, and ask them to add their homemade green hot \"sauce\" which is made with jalapenos, lemon juice and garlic. Delicious!  It's also great mixed into hummus.  Also, I don't know what kind of incredible Lebanese pickles they put in the falafel wrap but I'd buy a whole container of them if I could!  I took a variety of treats to a recent NASCAR race for tailgating and my friends were blown away by how delicious everything is.  I really can't say enough wonderful things about La Shish Kabob.  Unlike so many Mediterranean places, everything is FRESH and homemade, and that makes all the difference in the world!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service,food and prices! My favorite is the lamb gyro! I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"The staff was rude and the falafels were stale. I have no intents on returning. When I called to place the carry-out order the staff practically hung up on me without taking a name or telling me how long of a wait or giving me a total. I should have not even bothered to pick it up (dummy move #1). When I arrived, the place was very hectic. Customers were gathered around the counter in no particular fashion. Finally somehow I eventually made it to the counter, although there was never ever really any line or anything, where there was a guy behind it on the phone. He didn't greet me, but acknowledged me with a glare and I told him the order I placed. My second opportunity/cue to just leave...Nevertheless I paid and he placed my order on the counter without a word and walked away. I get home only to find dry falafels that apparently were not fresh. Nor were any of the other items in my order worthy. Total waste."}
{"text":"This place is affordable and fantastic. I got a huge platter of lamb and rice plus a super fresh salad for $11.99. This was easily enough for two, I'd estimate at least 12 ounces of lamb if not a full lb was on my plate. The lamb was excellent and the rice pilaf was one of the best I have eaten full of saffron and veggies. They also have excellent hummus and baba ganough.   The service was friendly. Took my order and it was done very quickly. The restaurant itself is in an old strip center but clean and nice and bright.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very welcoming, food tastes fresh. I played it safe by ordering something I have has before but looking forward to returning and trying a traditional dish!!"}
{"text":"Why didn't I discover this place sooner? You wouldn't know by the looks of the restaurant, but this place serves some of the best Mediterranean food you can find this side of the Atlantic! Not only is the food amazing, but the prices are super reasonable and really let you feel like you can try a bunch of new food without spending a ton of money! The lentil soup is some of the best soup I've ever had, though it is a bit on the spicy side! I also highly recommend the Lamb Philly Cheesesteak as a new spin on an American classic. Do yourself a favor and try this place out!"}
{"text":"My cousin told me about this spot months ago, I feel stupid for taking so long to go. I went with some friends for an early dinner and ordered the chicken shawarma & hommos with my two sides being salad and special rice. While we were waiting on our meals the guy working there gave us a sample of falafel. This was my first experience with falafel and it was AMAZING we actually ordered eight pieces. After knocking out the falafel our. Meals came out with enough food for a small army. I tried my hardest to finish my amazing hommos and rice but had to throw the towel in. Will definitely be back and hoping I can make it there from uptown on lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting NC from Cali. Numerous people told me that I must go to LA shish kabob, that it's the best in town. I went and had dinner there with some friends and boy were they right! It was sooo good! The meats had so much flavor and were sooo juicy! The customer service was excellent! Next time I'm in the area I will make sure I make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Fresh food daily! I order at least once a week, EVERY WEEK!!! The chicken shawarma wrap is amazing! I also like the human shwarma, tabouli salad. The lentil soup is great as well."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!!!! This place is hands down one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Their hummus is amazing especially when adding the Serrano peppers! Their falafel is also really good! I haven't been able to find a place that's as good as the food from when I was overseas. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"I've been going to \"Shish,\" as I affectionately call it, since it opened. What most others have said is true. It is easily overlooked, mostly because it's in a tiny little strip mall between a barber shop and an Ethiopian grocery/restaurant. There isn't much in the way of ambiance, but I don't really feel it's necessary. You go for the food, not because it's nice to look at or a fun place to chill.   The owner is always welcoming and friendly, even when they're packed. And, they're packed more often than not.   I've had most things on the menu and all if it is pretty good. Though, sometimes it is better than others. I much prefer popping into Shish rather than some greasy fast food spot. The food is fresh, homemade, and tastes great. Some favorite repeats of mine: lamb kabob wrap, tabbouleh, falafel wrap, vegetarian combo, chicken shawarma, & kibbeh.   I will say that their desserts are just okay. If you want something better, check out Golden Bakery next door or the Halal Market across the street. Oh, but their coffee is pretty great."}
{"text":"We love La Shish Kabob! We love finding smaller, authentic international food spots and La Shish is one of the first places we found when we moved to Charlotte 3 years ago. They have recently expanded and business seems to be booming! The owner/head chef is a funny guy and always recognizes us when we come in. Everyone who works there is always polite. The food is EXCEPTIONAL! The best hummus I've ever had, shawarma is phenomenal, and we recently tried the chicken shabousk (?) which is now one of our favorites. It may not be \"authentic\" but the chicken philly is also something we crave all the time. You should try La Shish Kabob!"}
{"text":"What a gem. Don't get me wrong this place is a hole in the wall, and from the outside it looks pretty shady. But it is authentic middle eastern food, the hummus, babba ganoush ,  tabouli are so good. They are all served with warm pita that is delish. The owner is very kind, and always happy to recommended his favorites, and the price point is great! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Extremely authentic. They even bless the meat before killing and cooking it. Awesome food, too. Will definitely come again. Sadly, they don't deliver; if they did, that'd be awesome."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love lamb and they know how to cook it. My husband and I went here for something fast and good and they did not disappoint. He order the lamb kabob wrap and I ordered the lamb Philly cheese sub. So far I think it's the best Philly cheese I have had in Charlotte. My husbands kabob was excellent as well."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing. Get the lamb. you'll miss out on something majestic if you don't. And totally don't be discouraged by the location. it's fast, they are incredibly friendly and you'll get two plates worth out of what you order. it was my first time eating middle - eastern food and i will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"What the dining area in this tiny strip-mall restaurant lacks in ambiance is made up in spades by the fresh and authentic flavors of the Middle East.  Truly this is a diamond in the rough, worth seeking out for well-known favorites like hommos, tabouli, and falafel.  In many senses, walking into LSK is no different from walking into an American deli.  A couple glass cases hold cold salads and meats.  There is a fryer and grill behind there.  A small case behind the register holds desserts.  Tables are basic and laminated menus are plentiful.    A closer look, though, tells you this is something different.  First off, the meats in the coolers are skewered on what looks like large swords.  Large skewers rotate on the grill over a gas flame.  Cold salads include tabouli, hommos and baba ganoush.  For my first venture in, I made lunch out of an order of falafel and stuffed grape leaves.  I watched as 8 small patties were scooped with a small tool and fried fresh before me.  They came out so hot that I couldn't close the container they were served in.  A quick taste proves what others have said- just the right mix of chewy texture inside with a crisp outside.  Moist and flavorful, these were a home run.  Stuffed grape leaves were perfectly portioned and came with a lemon-like dipping sauce.  These were slightly pungent by themselves, but the lemon sauce punched them up perfectly, like a counter-weight, adding some acid to the mix to balance the flavors.  I'd have some more, please.  Though I skipped it, the hommos looked creamy and fresh, and even the small order seemed enormous on the plates of other diners.  Wraps with shwarma or kafka looked huge and give me something to consider next time.  There are also daily lunch specials the owner, Izzat, will happily show you.  Braised lamb shank looked strong once unveiled, if that's you thing.  Gotta love the mix of regional flavors coming out of East Charlotte right now.  Asian, Latin American, Indian, and Middle Eastern: all are well-represented here.  Now if only it weren't such a trek to go explore.  Luckily, LSK makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"The lamb shank is delicious. The side dishes are too! The owner has always been friendly and you can tell he takes pride in the food and service at his restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited couple weeks ago on Thursday after early voting. All positive reviews for this establishment!! Ordered many dishes and all were beyond great. Owner is super nice and friendly and went out of his way to satisfy us, he knew it was our 1st visit. So glad I chose to come here rather than other Mediterranean establishments in Charlotte. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You might as well 'roll up' (insert Big Pimpin' here) because when you're done, you will need to be rolled out. Made the trek south for a day in the QC, specifically b/c I was needing some ethnic food to satisfy an itch. Based on all the great reviews, THIS was my go-to, must try spot.   Hubs and I took the ankle biters and enjoyed the following:  Appetizer Sampler, $6.99, choice of three apps. We selected the hummus, fallafel and dolmas Kgrape leaves.) All were very good. The fresh pita is the best I've had since Idunnowhen.   Various imported drinks, all well priced and really good.  Lamb Shank special, $9.99, with choice of side and soup/salad. Where the heck can you get lamb shank for under $10bucks????????? Hubs enjoyed this, as did the one year old ankle biter. Salad is light and fresh, served w/a light, lemon-y house made dressing.  Chicken Kabob entree, $7.99, w/choice of side and soup/salad. Looked, smelled and tasted like the food that fed my belly and soul as a kid growing up surrounded by Greeks, Turks and Armenians. Delicious.   Izzat, the owner, was very friendly, quick to reccomend and clearly has a lot of experience in the industry. The set-up is simple and a bit shabby, but you are there to feast and that you do. You are served on platters (PLATTERS!!!!) and will most definitely have more than enough to take home. The four of us devoured our food. They musta thought we hadn't eaten for days. Thank gawd many eastern cultures use their bread (pita) as a utensil - I didn't look like a *total* barbarian.   So why not four stars? One major point: the owner smoked while standing at the counter, next to our table....in the restaurant....which is illegal...and I was with two asthmatics....and I loathe cigarette smoke. My other nitpick: my food was delicious but the rice was barely warm. That said, we had enough really good food to easily feed six people (though with just four we can delight in leftovers) for $32 smackers! NICE!"}
{"text":"super!!! I am a bit of a critic when it comes to good Middle Eastern food especially since I have some of the best cooks in my family.  The \"special rice\" is a must order.  It is so savory and literally melts your mouth. The vegetarian selection here is awesome!    The man who own this place is a hoot!  The first time I came in he had his adorable little daughter at the counter and the interaction between the two of them was priceless.  I have been coming at least 3 times per week!  You will not find a better place to delight your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"This place is my JAM! Thankfully, I'm located less than 2 minutes from this little gem of a place and since discovering it on 9/29, I've been 6 times. That's right - 6 times in 8 days.  I can't get enough of their falafel wrap, and let me explain why:  1. 2.99 - with tax, total comes out to $3.64 2. Falafel is so moist, yet perfectly fried - it's a miracle and sin all in one 3. The salad they put on it is always fresh, light and cool 4. Please see #1 & #2 5. Izzat is always there and while I can't understand a word of what he says over the phone, when I walk in he is always smiling and asking after my health (Perhaps he wants to be sure I am in good health so I can continue to put his kids through college thanks to the rate at which he sees me). 6. Please see #1-5  So yes, I am in LURVE with this place and you should definitely try it. I've also had the grape leaves (good, salty though!), the hummos (home run, all the way, amazing) and the Babaganoush (yummy). An accomplice on one of my visits tried the Chicken wrap and before I could ask for a bite it was gone, so that also says something ;)  As others have said, don't let the shanty strip mall it's in get you down - this really is a very real, honest establishment that appears to really hold onto their roots and rock the Casbah of tastebuds in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place doesn't have more reviews. We tried  the falafal wrap, chicken shawarma and the kafta kabob wrap. All three were excellent and exactly what we were hoping for. The kafta is a must try in my opinion and the owner was so nice!"}
{"text":"Every time I dine here, it's delicious!  The Schwerma and mixed meat plate combined with garlic sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had fairly high expectations going in, and I'm so glad La Shish Kabob did not disappoint.  I plan to make many future trips to this little place.  My partner and I both had the lamb kabob wrap.  Inside, the lamp was so tender and wonderfully flavored.  I can't quite figure out what the spices are.  The hummus and the veggies inside were delicious.  I also had the falafel - I just loved the flavor, and the texture was perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.    My decor inside was not much, of course- just a few tables you can sit at.  Very plain decor and limited seating, but it's a good place to get take away.  The prices are very affordable; our wraps were $5 each and we got an 8 count falafel for $4.  All our food was made fresh while we waited.  The staff was quite friendly and helpful.  I'm excited about going back soon."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma sandwich in the US! Their other dishes are great as well. Not a fancy place but great food"}
{"text":"Wow that was really good. Had the #6 beef kabob. Picked a soda out of the nearby fridge. Great people watching, this place caters to a truly international crowd. The tightly packed tables gave it a communal vibe. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Middle Eastern food, this is the place for you! Though small,it packs a big punch with its robust menu. Portions and prices were exceptional.... Will be a favorite...."}
{"text":"Izzat for Mayor! While the food at La Shish Kabob is undeniably delicious, the owner, Izzat, is what makes this spot really special. Rarely can I even open the door myself before Izzat is there, flinging it open, welcoming us in with a big smile and warm greetings. He is truly a Charlotte gem, adding not only great food but out of this world hospitality and kindness to our community. If the restaurant isn't totally packed when you visit, take some time to chat with Izzat and learn his story about moving his restaurant (and family) from Jerusalem to east Charlotte. It's one of resiliency and hard work that will make you love him and La Shish even more than you did before.   Once inside, I always have order anxiety as the smells of slow roasting shawarma and kabobs envelope me. It's impossible not to order hummus, so just go ahead and plan on that. Freshly made and creamy, with olive oil drizzled on top, it's the stuff dreams are made of. I also love the babaganoush (roasted eggplant spread/dip) and tabbouleh (minced parsley, mint, olive oil, and who knows what else goodness), and falafel. Oh, the falafel! Also totally dreamy. In case you're not full just reading this, the chicken shawarma is also delish and served with french fries that are perfect to dip in the garlic mayo. So, pretty much, just order one of everything and plan to take a lot home to snack on for days after."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not the best but much better than other places. They charged 2.99 for extra garlic sauce which was un called for; otherwise ok"}
{"text":"The best food mediterranean food in Charlotte.  The shawarma is amazing, the hummus is rich and delicious, and the falafel is incredible and perfectly fried.  It is beyond fantastic with a wonderful owner and food that is authentic, reasonably priced, and you should go out of your way to eat hear as you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"First time we visited, it was packed and had a great energy. We got enough food to feed 8 people but there was only two of us and completely worth it! The leftovers were just as great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. I always enjoy come big here. It has been awhile but so happy I picked up some kabob dinners and salads to go tonight! Yum!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out with a girl friend and brought my husband later the same week. It far exceeded my expectations! I have been able to try a few things on the menu now and everything has been delicious. Get anything with lamb and you'll be pleased :)"}
{"text":"i went here for the recent Taste of the World jaunt.    I've never eaten lamb before, but it was a huge piece on the bone, that the minute I put my fork on it, fell away from the bone beautifully!    I devoured it quickly and now I can't wait to go back to try some other kebab things!  The sauces were delicious!  I loved the Baba Ganoush (sp) as well!"}
{"text":"Just ordered via PostMates...... who makes Chicken Shwarma without the pickle??? And,..... no marinara sauce included with my Mozzarella Sticks!? 3 stars only because the portion sizes were immense! Fries, as a side order to Mozzarella sticks??? Not rushing to order from here again..."}
{"text":"It was late on that hot and muggy Carolina Friday, and most places were closed, but their sign caught my eye. The smell of falafel was a delicious draw, so we decided to stop in.   This is not a restaurant. This is a hub.   The small restaurant was full of good sights, smells, and the chatter of friendly people in languages I didn't understand. Women in headscarves talked animatedly to eachother while scooping up laughing children to sit on their laps. Families talked to all tables as they sat down to delicious food.  Behind the counter, herbed beef, chicken, and lamb sizzled as music from Jerusalem sounded over the system.   Meet Izzat. He opened La Shish Kabob about two months ago after moving his family here from Jerusalem. When he invites you into his restaurant, it's like he's inviting you into his home. We gladly took a seat.  SERVICE: Astounding. Very pleasant and hospitable, and when I realized that I had accidentally ordered something with onions and green peppers (my friend is allergic), they instantly made another one and apologized even though it was my err. Instead of the original lamb kebab that was ordered, he made something that was a little different to better suit my friend's food requirements, without even being asked. And it was delicious.  FOOD: If you've never experienced good Middle Eastern food, experience it here. They have all of the classics, from falafel to baba ghannouj. The tabouli was out of this world (so much better than I make, I'm going to have to snag his recipe), with that clean and fresh parsley, lemon and olive oil flavor.  The kebab wraps (chicken and lamb) were flavorful and huge. They also sell the brand of mango nectar there that tastes like you're drinking a whole mango. Delicious. The baklavah and other goodies in the case looked mouth-watering, but I was too full. That comes on round 2.  PRICE: This is the awesome part. A heaping portion of tabouli for two, two lamb kebab wraps, one chicken kebab wrap, and 4 mango drinks comes out to: $26. So cheap for not only the portion size, but the quality and freshness as well.  When you walk into this place, you can feel that it's good people. If you stay, you'll quickly realize that it's good people, AND great food. When it's all over, you'll also see that it's all for a really affrodable price. I highly suggest giving this place some love, because it's one of the few places that will give it back."}
{"text":"First let me say I love the atmosphere of this place. It feels very homey, and the owner is very welcoming and helpful with recommendations. I give it 3 stars, because the food was good enough, but not amazing. Ordered lamb kabob, lamb gyro with fries,, and baba ganoush. The lamb kabob was full of flavor, and the meat was very tender. Could've used a little more meat in the sandwich, but nothing to complain about. The lamb gyro was good, nothing out of the usual. The fries however that came with it were soggy and undercooked. The best thing was the baba ganoush. They also offer prepared foods and desserts like baklava as well as other Lebanese canned and dry foods."}
{"text":"This place is authentic, delicious and a true gem here in Charlotte. Recommend anyone to come here and finish with a desert. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Really good food!  I've eaten at quite a few Mediterranean places and I enjoyed this one.  I had the gyro sandwich, it was delicious.  I prefer the gyro carved from the spit, but this was not.  The pita was fresh and the cucumber salad was yummy along with the sauce.  My wife had the New York schwarma and loved the flavors.  She said it was different from others she's had, but very good.  My son had the ground beef  kabob and loved it.   I had some too excellent flavor.  My wife and I enjoyed the lentil soup, but my son did not.  The owner was very nice.  The location is busy, not the best location in a strip mall.  The decor is pretty minimal and the buffet tables take up the back of the restaurant even when not in use.  Maybe a good carryout place, but not a terrible place to eat.  The food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Let's be straight here. The place doesn't look like much. The mall it is in doesn't look great, and the logo looks like some elementary school kids - albeit talented ones - scribbled it on the brick. But if you give it a chance, you will find that it is worth a stop.  On the inside, the service is second-to-none, and even on your first visit you are treated like family. Which is not to say the family that you don't want around (though if you act that way and they kick you out, it's your fault, so consider yourself warned). No, they are warmly welcoming and help you through the menu of options, which can certainly seem challenging if this is your first time.  When you get to the food, it's almost like an old diner, with an open kitchen and that's great but it also means there aren't a lot of tables - a better option may be to take the food to go - only then it would not be hot off the grill, so you can decide the best course of action for your own needs.  If you find a spot, sit down and dig into it right away so you get some of the goodness when it is fresh, and it's definitely a great spot to give a shot, elementary logo and all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. It's kind of a hole in the wall, but the food is solid. Go for the shawarma wrap with fries, shawarma with hummus, or the lamb shanks.   The shawarma is seasoned perfectly with allspice and lemon; it's shaved off the spit and finished on the griddle. Usually it's amazing... There have been a few times lately that the chicken has been a little dry, but I remedy that with an extra helping of their garlic sauce and the lemon-olive oil concoction on the tables.   The lamb shank is stewed and it falls off the bone.  The lentil soup is delicious.  They have menu items like burgers, Philly cheesesteaks, lamb cheesesteak, etc. and I'd advise you to stay away."}
{"text":"Oh!! I fell in love with their chicken shawarma!! One of THE BEST around Charlotte! My husband ordered lamb shanks and they were heavenly, cooked really well and awesomely flavored. We are definitely coming back whenever we are reminded of Mediterranean, which would be every month :-)"}
{"text":"I came here after seeing some rave reviews on Yelp. I ordered over the phone for pick up. The owner said it would be ready in 10 minutes and it sure was. I had the appetizer combo with hummus, falafel, and grape leaves. I had a side order of pita. The portions were generous. I really enjoyed my order and I would like to try the shawarma and kebabs next time I visit this establishment. The restaurant itself, is nothing fancy. It's good to note that they have had 100% sanitation rating the last three years. The owner is very kind! The prices are great."}
{"text":"The food is good but the owner very unpleasant.  Charges $4.50 for just rice and just French fries. As if consumers don't know this is one of the cheapest things to make/sale. Making a 400% profit. How sad. He should let his daughters run the business much nicer and smarter"}
{"text":"Oooooo this place was so good. The owner was so nice and very friendly.   Order the Lamb  Philly with the Falafel wrap. My 1st time and I am ready to come back. Excited to tell my friends"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for lunch with some co-workers.  My food was extremely dry and they charged me more than what the menu actually says online.  I called the manager back and he stated the prices were wrong, very unprofessional.  I paid 10 bucks for some fries and a shawarma.  I could've gotten the shawarma by itself and paid 5 bucks.  I guess the fries were 5 bucks.  Oh my sandwich was just meat nothing like the description he stated it was right."}
{"text":"It is a little far to me so I can't go every week. Excellent taste for the kebabs...I would do take outs here."}
{"text":"La Shis KaBOMB !  Cheap...fresh....excellent flavors...nice people !!  Ya just cannot beat it !"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday - bustling with people for the buffet. Ordered the chicken shawarma plate, a hot wrap filled to the brim with rotisserie chicken. Definitely affordable and delicious - a must stop if you're looking for something different from Latin in the Eastland area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was visiting Charlotte in June 2012 and my brother brought us here for dinner. The food was so good that we came back for our last meal here again before flying back to CA.  I would recommend the whole lamb leg or the cheese steak sandwich. Their sheesh kabab was very delicious. The owner was very accommodating to our family"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner is really nice and the food is awesome. They are super clean and it's always fresh. It's food made with love. They have a selection of meats and vegetarian dishes as well. I go every week and never have anything but an awesome experience."}
{"text":"This food is amazing better than fine dining restaraunts that I've been to. Best lamb sharks I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Decent food rice was real dry. Pieces of chicken where real bland maybe just not the best dish to try. It was the chicken kabobs with rice and salad"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times now and have had mostly good experiences. I tried the kibbeh, tabouli, hummus, lamb kabob sandwich and shwarma. I've enjoyed everything, especially the hummus, except for the shwarma. Honestly, I've had better. But that's not enough to keep me from going back. The place always smells so awesome and there's still a million things on the menu I haven't tried yet!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what I love more, the people or the food.  The owner is amazing.  The food is amazing.  The atmosphere is amazing.  It is an outstanding place.  I cannot say enough good!"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern joint in Charlotte, hands down. They recently remodeled to include more seating inside the restaurant, which much better accommodates the volume of customers. I usually get a wrap and the veggie plate. The chicken shawarma is always cooked perfectly and has wonderful flavor while still being tender. The veggie plate is a HUGE amount of food, which I get to share with at least one other person. The lintel soup is so tasty, and welcome in the cold months. The price is right, especially for the quality and quantity of food and the owner is one of the nicest I've had the pleasure of talking to in Charlotte. If you're not eating here, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"If not the best, one of the best middle eastern restaurants I've ever been. The owner is the chef as well. I had shawarma platter and it was awesome. Service is very friendly and you feel at home. I'm recommending this restaurant to all who want to try new taste and those who love kabob."}
{"text":"I've been shish kabobed into this place .. amazing flavors, something new to me and the charcoal grill on the meats is awesome :)"}
{"text":"I love this dirty, small, simple yet delicious place. I lived in Berlin for a while and loved these places. If you are there for quality food and do not mind that the eye will see some greasy cooking and a bit rundown environment than you are in for a treat. This place is as authentic as it can get. Unfortunately, it is not located close to my place, but I think about this place a lot and cannot wait to return. They serve wonderful shwarma sandwiches even with pickles in them, the way I am used to it from the Lebanese places I used to eat at in Berlin. Great prices and many different options. The staff is super friendly. There are not many tables, but it is always possible to get a spot. There are also a few tables outdoor, however, it is not equipped for large groups.  I love this place and will continue to return and highly recommend the food quality and options in terms of Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Not bad at all if you can ignore the less than posh ambience?  falafel very tasty but little dry, likewise for the chicken shawarma!  The Lentil soup is extremely pgood with a lil kick spice with a Turkish hint of flavor.  We ll be back to try other Arab delights little pricy FYI"}
{"text":"I actually went to this restaurant because of the Yelp reviews. The reviews were so correct. The people were so friendly and the food was delicious. I am so glad I found a really good resturant that is close to my job. I have shared the menu with all of my co-workers because they said my food was smelling wonderful throughout the office."}
{"text":"What are the other reviewers talking about?  This place is horrible!  Do not eat here!!  We went there for lunch on a Sunday.  The place itself looked shabby but it had a lot of people there eating so we decided to give it a try because of the great reviews on Yelp.  We ordered our food at the register and payed for it.  Then I noticed that the cook was handling the money with gloves on but then goes back to cooking without changing gloves!!  I was pretty grossed out but I figured we had already paid for the food so I was going to eat it and pray that we don't get sick from it!  The food was not that great!  We barely ate any of it!!  Then after we had finished we went back to our car and we were sitting there for a minute in the parking lot looking up directions and the cook knocks on our car window!  We opened the door and he says \"You not pay me!\"  So we told him that we payed when we ordered the food and then he just walked away!  What a strange experience!!"}
{"text":"A/C not working well, 82 inside and 96 outside.  Middle Eastern food served buffet style for $14.95/plate, plus the cost of drinks.  Food was just ok, Ant liked the different selections of chicken.  Nice owner that greeted us as we came in."}
{"text":"First time here and this place is pretty good. The prices on food is reasonable.  The lentil soup is delicious, and lamb kabob was cooked right."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Middle Eastern food, and La Shish Kebob is pretty good.  I have to warn you - La Shish Kebob is not in the nicest strip mall and the restaurant itself is extremely small.  But please, don't let their location or interior deter you from giving them a try.   We were enthusiastically greeted by the owner and led to our table.  We ordered the 8-piece falafel platter as our appetizer.  For dinner, I ordered the vegetarian combo (with hommos, baba ghannouj and yalanji), and my hubby ordered the mixed grill kabob (with lamb, chicken, and beef).  I also ordered the special rice for $1 on the side.  Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious.  My only complaint was with how they delivered our food.  Since my vegetarian plate did not need to be cooked, it was delivered first and placed in the center of the table.  I thought - what, this is my dinner, right?  So, my hubby and I ended up sharing it while we waited for the falafel and his kabobs to arrive. The falafel plate was huge, outstanding in flavor, and lighter in texture than we are accustomed to (in a good way). We also shared my hubby's meat plate when it arrived, and it ended up being my favorite - the meat was really tender and juicy.  Frankly, I have never had chicken or lamb this delicious before.    The owner stopped by several times to see how we were doing, and even gave my hubby a special hot sauce that he just loved.  We could tell he took great pride in his place.  I'm only dropping a star because on subsequent visits, they were busier, and so the service suffered.  It's also a tiny place inside, and hard to enjoy your meal when it's really busy."}
{"text":"Oh wow the philly cheese steak is amazing. The owner had the best memory when you place orders. He doesn't even need to know your name. Pick up orders are fresh and ready quick."}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing!   We had the grilled lamb kabob platter,  Lebanon salad and the vegetarian combo which has hummus, grape leaves, baba ghannouj and falafel. The food is authentic, delicious and fresh, all at a very low price. If you're looking for great authentic Mediterranean food this is the place to visit!"}
{"text":"Hours are great, especially if you are out late and don't want the same old fast food.  I read a lot of good things about this place.  I was only in for a quick bite, I had babaganoush and pita. The prices are great and the quantity of dip is good. If you go, ask for more pita because I ran out before the dip! Great flavor!! Great service!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously nice & welcoming staff, great food and inexpensive. Most ethnic eateries aren't as welcoming if you aren't from the country or don't speak the language, this guy calls everyone \"Friend\". I got the chicken shawarma, baklava, and falafel wrap. I will return!"}
{"text":"It's been several months since I've stopped by because while the food is usually excellent, one of the cooks actually took my order and bagged my food. What a let down. I paid $10 for an appetizer falafel and a side of tabouli. The tabouli side is supposed to come with a pita which was absent from the bag as well as no fork or spoon to eat it with. It's probably better to eat in as I have gotten excellent service from who I assume is the owner. Since I live across from the airport, I probably won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for a Tuesday lunch.  Had the buffet , not bad. 4 meats, 2 soups, plain and seasoned rice, 3 sauces, hummus, and couple of salads.  A bit pricy for the minimal spread, but the food was good.  Nothing spicy, some needed more spice.  Overall, we will be back, but probably order from the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch last week. My first visit. Not much to look at but I wasn't there for the decor. I ordered a falafel wrap to go. Wow! Great flavors. The wrap was outstanding! The price was nice too, $3.99. I need to go back and try the shawarma. One tip: if you have a job that requires you to talk to the public, the falafel wrap might not be the best choice if you are on a lunch break. Plenty of onions & garlic in this one. I'll be back for another go on my day off!!"}
{"text":"Very good prices. The meat is prepared well. The only complaint is the rice...it's kind of stale and flavorless. Other than that these guys have perfected quick-sit-down Middle Eastern food for Charlotte standards."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love la shish! I have only ever had the chicken shawarma and haven't tried anything else because it is awesome. For $7.99, you get two small wraps and fries. I don't really eat the fries but that's because the wraps are sooooo yummy. The chicken is so flavorful and the Arabic pita bread is delicious. There is a garlic sauce on the side that is potent and amazing!    My boyfriend likes their cheese steak so for those who don't want authentic middle eastern, they got something for you! He also normally eats one of my chicken shawarma wraps and likes it. #chickenshawarmaalldayeveryday  The highlight of this place is the man at the register, who I assume is the owner. He is always so kind, gracious and friendly. Definitely go and enjoy!  Update: since my initial post, I've tried items other than the chicken shawarma and I did not love it as much. Back to my usual..."}
{"text":"My tastebuds will never be the same! For appetizer we had the combo appetizer (you pick 3) with hummus, grape leaves and kibbeh. Oh my word y'all. The hummus was so creamy and rich, grape leaves were fantastic, but seriously, the kibbeh- I can't put it into words how amazing this fried little meat wad is! Haha. Next was entrees.. Lamb shanks were falling off the bone and cooked PERFECTLY. The marbling was to die for and the meat was so juicy. The lamb kabob is cooked differently but equally as awesome. Finally we ended with desert- baklava, the owner said he had just made it that morning. I almost broke up with my boyfriend over the last piece- flaky, light, cream filled center, and not too sweet which is so rare to find in a desert! It was phenomenal!  Thank you La Shish for a wonderful, quick, and affordable dinner!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. What more can I say? The meats are delicious, the lamb kabob is my favorite, the spices are so good. The lentil soup is bangin' and that little side of creamy stuff to put in it...do it! The meat plattera come with a huge pile of rice and it's amazing! Just eat here. The owner is awesome and so friendly, as most of the middle eastern places here are."}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times.  They expanded their menu and the place got bigger. The lamb is really good and very consistent.  The personnel and the owner especially is very nice, he will always greet you and will make you feel at home . One of my favorite places for middle eastern food"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible restaurant. The quality of food is really bad. The service is not good at all, they don't even bring you a drink."}
{"text":"Most favorite Mediterranean place in Charlotte. We drive 20 mins twice a week for their lamb shanks!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Inspired by multiple viewings of The Avengers back in the summer, my husband and I decided we really wanted to try shawarma. Although we'd never had it, Tony Stark's obsession and the ensuing post-credits scene were enough to spark our own shawarma craze. We were driving past La Shish Kabob one day and I noticed the neon sign indicating our quest could find its resolution there. I remembered reading many glowing reviews of the place here on Yelp. Within a day or so we had found our shawarma salvation, and it's less than a five-minute drive from home.  This unassuming hole in the wall is cramped and chaotic, but it is home to some of the best Middle Eastern food in town. Don't let the lack of fancy atmosphere steer you away from what could be your new favorite joint.  We now eat here or get takeaway at least two or three times a month. Yes, the shawarma is outstanding. Their falafel is the best I've ever had and the hummus is high up there, too. As a lifelong dolmas aficionado, I have to say theirs are the best I've had since I was a kid and visited an Egyptian family that my dad knew. My husband and I love to get the appetizer plate, always with hummus and dolmas. Everything we've tried has been incredible."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my college days in London. Nothing better than leaving the pub and making your way over to the kabob shop. Seriously, this place is open late, the service is friendly, the food is amazing, and it is cheap. I have never eaten in because lets be real who wants to eat a kebab in a shop when you could have it on your couch with Netflix?   The beef is charred and tasty, the tahini is on point, and the tabouli is to die for. Seriously check this place out! I'm curious about their sweets, those will definitely be on my to do list for next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! You're gonna walk in and be like what in the world.. I know because that was me. Middle eastern is in my blood so finding a good middle eastern place can be tricky. This place is great. I recommend the Kafta, Hummus, Mixed grill, tabouli, and for desert make sure you get Kenfi! So good!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often, I honestly don't find it very tasty, it's ok-ish, but when I have a hankering for Falafel and my favorite Mediterranean food restaurant is closed, well then, you gotta settle. I am not saying it's dreadful, no it's decent, they could do with tasting what they cook more often. I have found the food to be either over seasoned or bland-ish. Overall, I will come back because, I love falafel. Oh I do enjoy their red lentil soup, much! Sadly, they do not carry it often."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem!! My weekends are not complete until I have had at least one meal from La Shish... it's usually a Sunday afternoon takeout. Basmati rice so perfectly cooked, to go with the perfectly seasoned chicken kabobs (the lamb kabobs are good too, I'm just a bigger fan of the chicken ones)  Warm pita bread with fresh falafels, topped with hummus, fries and garlic dip on the side. It doesn't get any better than this. In my experience, the food has always been fresh and flavorful, and the portions are big! Really great value for your money. There's something so wonderful about food that's simple, affordable & downright delicious - For complete soul, palette & pocket satisfaction - check out La Shish!"}
{"text":"This place is everything that is RIGHT about the middle east. Great service, Great food, a crappy atmosphere that just screams \"We are serving amazing food not supplying comfy chairs\".   I cant wait to return, truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Visited this past Friday evening with my husband and 4 yr old son. We were welcomed and the menu vs the buffet was explained.  My dad had recommended the lamb shank, which I ordered, and my husband decided on the chicken kabobs.  I would have given this place a 5 star review for my lamb shank.  It was fork tender and packed full of flavor.  My son and I devoured it, yes my 4 yr old son loves lamb :)  My husband's dish, on the other hand, was missing the vegetables and the chicken was bland.  No strong flavor or marinade.  It was a disappointment.  We should have asked about the vegetables but being new to the place, we decided against it.  Also, the falafel was delicious too.  I will definitely go back but not sure if I can convince my husband to.  All in all, have the lamb!"}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food around Charlotte, looks like a hole in the wall but being from NY you know that is where some of the best quality food is served. I have come here probably a dozen times since moving to Charlotte and not once have I been disappointed. Dine in is equally as enjoyable, again do not mind the atmosphere the people around you are all enjoying the food and conversation, and the staff is extremely kind. One of my top 5 food spots in the Queen City."}
{"text":"I love this place, first it's like a Palestinian deli in NYC, they have freshly made salads, hummus, also Cornish hen, and THR portions a HUGE...so you need to be hungry! The food it's fantastic and you can have also amazing desert! Won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just wish I had found this place sooner. Love it!  I have been starved for good Middle Eastern food in Charlotte.  This place is By Far the best that I have tried.  The price are extremely low and the quality is exceptionally high. The portions are large. How they can sell two lamb shanks for such a low price is beyond me.  You don't come here for the atmosphere.  You come here for the food.  But I did think that the diversity of the patrons was very interesting. I've probably eaten here 6 or so times now and every time I have been extremely impressed.   Just try La Shish Kabob.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has now grown a buffett.  it is a little expensive at 15 adult and 9 for childrens but this place still gets 5 stars bc the buffet quality is still the same quality as menu items.  food is fresh and amazing"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The lentil soup is good and so are the lamb gyros. Can't wait to go for the buffet."}
{"text":"DAMN YOU EXPECTATIONS!  After all these raving reviews, I dragged my newly-found-food-loving boyfriend past my usual quickie hole in the wall middle eastern place on Central Ave. to try out this new hole in the wall for an early dinner.  The place looks promising as we walked in: small, nothing fancy, and a table of middle eastern diners... my thought was, SCORE!  With all the options it was hard to make a decision.  But I was determined to try the lentil soup so I ended up getting the half roast chicken with 2 sides, one side being the soup and the other being the special rice ($7.99).  He ordered a falafel sandwich wrap ($2.99) and a chicken chicken shawarma sandwich wrap ($3.99).  Lentil soup was different, almost has a hint of squash taste, plus it's my first non-green lentil soup, but it was otherwise yummy and perfect for an unexpected day of cold weather.  Then the rest of the food arrived.  The 2 sandwich wraps were huge for the price... but disappointingly they had more fillers (tomato/cucumber/etc.) than the meat and the sauce so the taste got washed off a little.  The falafel one was definitely better; it was perfectly crispy fried and well seasoned.  Meanwhile my half chicken and rice looked impressive.  I swear there's enough rice to feed a family of four on the plate.  But as I forked my way into the chicken, it was unbelievably DRY!  I seriously could not even eat the wing because it was bone dry.  The skin looked yummy golden brown but lacked flavor... so if the skin had no flavor, imagine how bland the meat was.  It's so dry that even the dark meat was getting tough, which I didn't even think was possible.  What a let down :(  The only saving grace of my plate was the garlic sauce... it looked like a lump of mayo, but it was garlic-y.  I smeared it all over everything to give my plate some much needed taste.  Since it's my 1st visit, I am not going to write it off yet.  I think next time I'll give their kafta a try.  But my suggestion is to stay away from the chicken.  The only other high point of yesterday's visit was the discovery of a newly open Nile Grocery and Ethiopian Restaraunt sign that was being put up as I was fighting a losing battle with my chicken."}
{"text":"This place is the best kind of hole-in-the-wall. As a Middle Easterner in Charlotte, I was thrilled that my friend brought me here. Don't be afraid of the lack of glamour--this place has heart and the food is cooked with lots of love and clearly cherished recipes. This is authentic Middle Eastern food with hard working staff and chefs who were so kind.   The flavors of the food were impeccable....shout out to the tabbouli (so fresh) and the richness of the way they prepare all of their meats. The portions are substantial. I would love to try some of their Friday specials sometime. I highly recommend the meat pies. I had plenty of food to bring home, and I know I'll be visiting again when I need my fix of Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Go there! Get the lamb kabob. Pay the extra buck for the special rice. Ask for all the sauces because they're all amazing. We got the appetizer sampler thing and everything was delicious. The lentil soup is crazy good. You CANNOT go wrong here. Tons of awesome, fresh food at a very reasonable price. Oh, and don't expect atmosphere because there is none but it seems to be mainly a takeout place anyway."}
{"text":"This is so much better than any of the the greek/middle eastern chains out there so skip then and head here.  I love their Vegetarian Combo it has everything you would want on it.  I have never been there for their buffet which is on my list.  They are great for take out and the portions are very large.  Most orders come with bread and ask for extra garlic butter because it is great.  The owner is also super nice and if your order is ever wrong he makes sure to make up for it."}
{"text":"If you're looking some pretty good food, La Shish is your place!  The food here is delicious and priced very well. The portions are large, so sharing is definitely an option (that is if you can pull yourself away from your yummy dish).  The restaurant is cozy with a really friendly manager, he's very helpful and kind. I've been here a few times, and I think I finally have a favorite. Shwarma's are great, and the homemade hummus is something I could eat by the spoonful O_o !!!   I love getting the 3 Kabob plate which comes with lamb, chicken, and kafta. KAFTA KAFTA, so so so yummy. I mean I pretty much ate all of that first, then the lamb, followed by whatever chicken I could fit into my belly. This is a good choice if you want to share or try a few different things.   The food here is always on point and I've never had a bad experience. I'm a huge fan of La Shish Kabob, and will be back soon."}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 10 after our families decided to meet up in the area.  I read so many good things about this place. The place is small but, even late at night, there was pretty good business.  The owner looked straight out of The Hobbit trilogies and wasn't super warm and fuzzy.    I think this place was too hyped up in my head after reading the glowing reviews. We had taken our food back to the hotel and unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype.  I don't think anyone finished their meal.  I love me some spices but the entire meal was entirely too overly spiced.  It might have been due to the meat tasting a bit off...so maybe the heavy hand in spices was to offset that taste/fact?  I was especially excited about kibbeh being on the menu but instantly disappointed when I popped in the first bite.  Too bad I ordered a bunch of everyone.  We are huge fans of kafta but we could barely finish ours.  The kids even quit early and they loooooiiove kafta/kufta/kubideh.  Overall, the portions were decent and the food ok if I hadn't had anything to compare it to.  Maybe this was just an off night since I'm sure the reviews are glowing for a reason."}
{"text":"La Shish is where it's at for some quick and yummy gyros or hummus, kabobs and just good meat in general. They just recently opened up another side to have more seating (like over double than what was in there before). IT IS NOT FANCY. So don't go in there on your high horse. It's all about speed with them and I appreciate that. Ask them anything if you have questions or don't know what something is. You get huge portions. Just give them your order, go grab a drink from the cooler and pick a table. The owner is really nice, he has a huge family so I am happy to see their success in this spot, it is always busy (hence why the expanded.)  My fave is that bomb hummus with some grilled chicken, delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible.... I am so sorry to have to write this, but it turns out to be a must.   Inconsistency can kill a restaurant and it just killed it for me at La Shish. Still shaking my head over this one.   So this is the second time (mind you in a row) that my order was horrible. And now, they screwed up my mothers order -- she is 100 times worse than I when it comes to food, but we both behave the same... once,  okay we will try it again... twice, more than like not again. And if we decided to try it again, it will be a day far away.    I ordered the Arabic Shawarma chicken wrap (both times) and it was bland ass boring and last night out right gross. If I wanted plain chicken thrown on a flat grill with no seasoning, I could of did that myself thank you. And the tahini -- was that mayo or tahini... BOTH TIMES. Argh.   My mother ordered the Lamb Kebob's and the cook added so much hot sauce she couldn't eat it. Mind you she loves hot sauce, but on a Lamb kebob, that should be the customers choice, not the cook going rogue! (the Kebob, which she always orders has NEVER had hot sauce on it before)   And the hommos... smh... there was so much sumac, it was inedible. It was so bitter.   What a shame... I love their prices and I did love the flavor. My mom thinks its the cook... the young one is not supervised, where the older one understands the flavor and seasoning level.   Only reason it got two stars is because my fathers order was ok -- he got the vegetarian wrap.   Another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"All these raving reviews are 100% right!   Tried La Shish Kabob for the first time last night. I've been curious after seeing it rated as one of the best places to get hummus in Charlotte by Charlotte Agenda.  We ordered the following items:  Hummos Dip Appetizer Grape Leaves Appetizer  Kofta Kabob Wrap Mixed Grilled Kabob Entrée  Everything was so delicious! The hummos dip was served with huge pieces of fresh pita, we had our food delivered by Ubereats--I can only imagine how good the pita is when served right there. Very tasty and very much deserving of it's title as one of the best in Charlotte.  Grape Leaves were served cold, which I prefer--I've had them warm and wasn't as big of a fan. Stuffed with rice, tomato and parsley they were really yummy. Appetizer comes with 6 in it.  Kofta Kabob Wrap was HUGE--wrapped in warm pita and served with with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and hummus. Was especially great with the hot sauce provided.   Mixed Grilled Kabob Entrée was the absolutely favorite. You get to try chicken, lamb and kofta served on a giant bed of rice. The portion size was insane, had it for lunch today! This is also served with a fresh small salad.  Try this place out, you won't regret it! Price was low and portions were big!"}
{"text":"I got a large take out order for a party and the food as well as the service was very good.  Prices are ok too."}
{"text":"They have the best Falafel I ever had... by far.   I have been eating Falafel my whole life in NYC an LI and would of been happy just to find a place that even offered it in Charlotte... but this place totally blew away my mediocre expectations.  I haven't had anything else here because I can not pass up on the amazing Falafel.  Oh, and it's $3!!!"}
{"text":"Just for the record absolutely hands-down the best middle Eastern cuisine I've ever had still to date ! Me and a buddy AJ and his family went here couple years ago now ...damn good food omg it's really amazing.. Yes there is other places in town but after revisiting this place again it's just better I think. You have to check out the Kibbeh, Falafel, Chicken Shawarma, Kafta Kabobs....!!  They also have a few desserts but my favorite is Baklava. If your a coffee person try the real deal Turkish coffee .....You won't regret it you'll thank me later ...enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant, great, authentic food, great service, friendly proprietor, great value.  Love eating here or getting to go.  Everything is good.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"This is some phenomenal Mediterranean food that won't break the bank. I have eaten here a few times and it leaves me always wanting more of their food. Each item is perfectly prepared with a great mixture of spices and flavors.  The one tip I will share in this review is that all Mediterranean food is very similar, but it's also very different. So if you're looking for a specific dish you might not find it here because while it's Mediterranean food, it's really Lebanese. This creates dishes with slightly different spices but still a delight for any Mediterranean food lover."}
