{"text":"This store is bright and clean, the prices are comparable to others with a just right selection. Their banchan are very good and well priced. 
Love that they always have some good kpop playing in the store as well."}
{"text":"Ah see, Yelp works - I thought this was a Mexican grocery until I ran across these reviews... Paldo - doesn't that sound Spanish, anyway maybe not....

Went over to investigate the 'food corner' -  all the slots were occupied when I arrived, so, while keeping an eye out for an open seat, I  had to spend a few minutes appearing very intrigued by two jars labeled in Korean... 

Glad I waited; bit of kimchi, bit of little salty fish for small plates (banchan) along with the spicy pork  - deep flavor and generous serving - left very content..."}
{"text":"I drive 25 miles to get to this place but not for grocery. In side the grocery store, there is a little food corner. just 5 chairs. nothing to talk about. but food is the best korean food I have ever had in America. The lady who cooks - she is so good. Her cooking reminds me of my mom's cooking. I go there at least once a month to get my 
Korean food and side dishes She also makes different side dishes - they are always fresh and good. awesome little place to taste the real korean food - cheap and good. each dish is less than $8 but better than any of Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great! If you need anything Korean this is the place to go. They have pretty much everything that you might need to make your average Korean dish. The only thing they don't have is soju, unfortunately, but there is a place nearby that has it. I will definitely keep going for the kimbab."}
{"text":"Authentic flavors on the bulgogi! Squid was delish as well. And m u s t buy dry seaweed on the way out folks or ur doing urself a disservice!!"}
{"text":"Kinda super awesome! All the Koreans come here, it has the yummiest things, from noodles to Korean cookies. oh yeah, I must mention their fruits and veggies...dude, they're like fresh out of a picture!"}
{"text":"I can't quite give Paldo 5 stars as it could never compare to the mega korean marts in California...but for such a small store, it packs surprisingly large variety of Korean goods, plus a food stand!

Paldo and Asiana are the only 2 korean markets I've been to in the whole Phoenix area, but between the 2 of them, I have all my korean needs provided. 

For Paldo, the produce always looks fresh and the prices seem reasonable...they are probably more expensive than say Lee lee's, but korean markets are always a little higher priced. They have all the requisite korean fruits and veggies for authentic cuisine. Occasionally some of the pre-packed fruits (like peaches) and veggies (like cucumbers) might be alittle old and have some mold on them, so I always try to inspect what I buy. I feel like it's more a problem with being wrapped up tight in plastic and styrofoam b/c the items that are freestanding always appear very fresh.

The meat department is small but serviceable. You won't find a large variety of cuts here, but for standard korean bbq items, and for making soups you can find what you want. Again, probably a little pricier than at other asian markets. 

The dry, refrigerated, and frozen goods are pretty standard and you can find all the things you could possibly need for making korean food from scratch, or a lot of instant/premade foods that just need heating up or minimal preparation. The only thing that selection seems a little week on are beverages. Kimchi is always plentiful and offer a good variety of types of jarred kimchi, or kimchi in bags

The food stand serves up truly homemade Korean food, like what you would get at home..certainly homier than what you would get in a standard Korean restaurant. No bells and whistles, just hot tasty food straight up. 

But to me the real strength of this market is their premade banchan - or those freebie side dishes you're always offered at Korean restaurants that act as appetizers? There's a really wide variety of ban chan available, and although the small packages seems a little expensive ($3-5 each), if you know how much time it takes to prepare each individual side dish...it's well worth the price to buy them already made. Sides like soy sauced beef & egg are usually hard to find in korean markets, so it's a huge bonus this place does it well. In the pre-prepared section are also huge packs of pre-marinated bulgogi, and other kimchi preparations. Also, you can find freshly made kimbap (korean sushi rolls), and occasionally other warm items like savory korean pancakes. Even if you don't cook korean food, you can buy a bunch of these items and have a full korean meal at home, and some of it is actually better than my mom's."}
{"text":"This shop is a small specialty Korean grocery, not a mega mart of all things Asian. Despite its size, Paldo is super well stocked and efficient. Their pre-marinated bulgogi is awesome. Veggies are always fresh and they carry hard to find Korean peppers (jalapeno look alike, but more of a cucumbery taste). A few Japanese items are also sold. Don't skip the ice-cream freezer! My favorites are the sweet corn (best ice-cream flavor ever) and melon bars.

The in-store restaurant is pretty good, too. They usually have a few packaged dishes displayed in front. Great if you don't have the time to order food. I often grab a Korean roll to eat on the go."}
{"text":"I just wanna say they have Melona here, my favorite light, popsicle bar dessert of all time.  So if you're looking for Melona, this is your place!  I tried 3 or 4 other places before I finally found a place in Phoenix that carried them.  So hopefully some poor lost person looking for Melona will read this and be able to find them here!"}
{"text":"For an Asian market of modest size, this place has a lot of good-quality stuff - sweet-potato noodles, fresh produce, dried seaweed, salted shrimp paste, Asian condiments galore ... too many things to list. They have a refrigerated section that has an assortment of banchan as well as marinated meats ready to grill; my friend Jan who happened to be in the market at the same time that I was shopping there was able to grab the last of the marinated ready-to-cook beef short ribs ahead of me, so I'll have to come back another day for that. Tucked in a corner of the store is a small eatery - a table for 4 and a counter that seats about 6 - that serves a short list of Korean entrees. I was hoping to try the spicy squid which the other reviewers were raving about but it was no longer in the menu, so I tried the spicy beef instead; it was a tasty stick-to-the-ribs meal, especially with the kimchi and spicy beansprout sides that came with it.  Apparently they had shortened the menu and raised the prices a buck since the last reviews that mentioned the eatery, so that the meat entrees cost a penny short of 10 bucks. In all, I find this a pleasant place to buy Asian groceries and grab a quick and hearty Korean meal."}
{"text":"There is a new cook in the kitchen and the menu has changed a little bit.  But the food is still very good.  Still one of the best places in the Valley to get Korean food."}
{"text":"Finally! An excellent Korean Market with a cafe in back. I love their kimchi selections and the cafe. This is well needed in the Phoenix metro area and I am happy it is close here in Tempe. A great addition to the city!!"}
{"text":"A small Korean grocery store, a bit more pricey than others.

Friendly owner and fresh/moderately priced beef is all that bring me back.

If I lived near ASU, I would probably go a lot more often, but as it stands, there are more moderately-priced Asian grocery stores to choose from (like Lee Lee, Mekong, Asiana)."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this market and it's  absolutely  amazing!! The fruit and vegetables are incredibly fresh as well as their meat section.  The banchan section has a wide variety and it hasn't been sitting on the shelf for days as what you see in asiana market in Mesa.  The lunch counter in the back is delicious!!!!! I love the kalbi stew and spicy octopus.  I will be back weekly!"}
{"text":"Got kimchi?  Got bulgogi?  Got mochi?  Well... Paldo's Market does!  It's a super clean and well-organized Korean (and a bit Japanese) market that's fun to go and buy things randomly from.  There are tons of treats for the people who don't cook Asian food or high-quality imported needs for those who do.  

As for me... I love to go and get treats, some basic ingredients (like meats or seafood) and... cruise around looking at all the cute Korean guys. keke  It's even better when they've just come from the LA Fitness that's next door.  *sigh*

See ya there!!!"}
{"text":"When I drove by this place, I thought this place was a Mexican grocery. Imagine my surprise when I parked and saw the Korean writing :).

A great find. From the outside it may not look that big, but inside I was a bit blown away. The market has plenty of isles that have provided me with some excellent access to Korean goods. 
Every Asian market should have a snacks isle;Asians love to munch and I've been able to munch away on all kinds of Korean snacks. Granted not all of of the snacks have been worth my money but I've found some favorites.
The section that I like the most is the produce section. Sometimes the goods are competitively prices but the produce is always fresh and some things that can't be found at other Asian markets like Lee Lee, can be found here-- and example is perilla leaves.
There are other great things I can say, but over all it's a great place.
The only reason it's three stars is because the prices aren't competitive."}
{"text":"Closed for good. So sad. :'("}
{"text":"Paldo is a store that makes you want to cook just because the ingredients are awesome.  Make no mistake, this is primarily a Korean market for food, not just random junk.  From the \"green (environmentally-friendly) rice\" to the skin care masks in the front of the store to the vegetable labels written in Korean, Paldo is an excellent place to make your own Korean food.

I was ready to walk into the market and bust out in Korean conversation, ready for a bubbly Korean person to engage me in wonderful talks about how great the Korean culture and food are.  Unfortunately, that did not happen. I strolled up and down the aisles, bought some prepared food, and did not even venture to bother the women cooking.  Maybe the cold, rainy morning reflected into their moods.  Either way, we didn't talk to each other.

The prepared foods are generally $4-8, but they are meant to be side dishes for families, not just for individual snacks.  You could buy already marinated kalbi ribs and bulgogi barbecue beef.  I noticed how fresh the rice cakes are - none of this hardened noodle stuff.  The produce section was filled with extremely fresh vegetables.  There is also a little place to order food in the market, and most of those dishes run from around $6-9.

I bought some kimbap (sort of like a Korean hand roll) and it was good (in the fact that it was made for me) but not the best.  I am used to kimbap with bulgogi and spinach in it - this kimbap was the kind with imitation crab meat.  It was alright.

I would recommend this market if you want a clean market for East Asian food.  It is an awesome Korean market, and I never felt bad for strolling the aisles.  In fact, I will probably go there later today on my way back to Tucson.  Honestly, there are some places that have a larger Korean selection, but you have no idea how long something has been sitting on the shelf!  Go here for fresh Korean ingredients!  One of the best out of the entire Valley (especially if you want to run in and out without engaging in Korean conversation). 4.4 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place, because I can get my homemade tofu jigae fixin' and my giant tubs of kimchi! They sell Korean groceries here; the meat selection is huge. They also have a hot-food stand in the back where you can order a la carte, or you can buy one of the store's refrigerated prepared foods and ask the kitchen to cook it for you (for instance, the stand doesn't sell bulgogi, but you can buy prepped raw bulgogi and they'll cook it). I've had the stand's tofu jigae and it's not great, so perhaps stick with the prepped foods? 

They have a lot of prepped or frozen food. Don't be scared by the foreign labels; I can't read Korean but the ladies at the registers are always game to translate for you. 

As far as prices go, they are fair for Korean markets. I've been to more expensive places in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Paldo Market is extremely clean, and boasts fresh products at cheap prices!  The market itself has a great selection of traditional Korean products, along with a variety of fish / seafood / meat.  There is a small counter in the back corner of the store where you can order extremely reasonably priced entrees as well.  Super friendly workers, you really can't beat this place for the combination of service, price, and quality.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They have some great unique spices at this place. The store is always nice and clean and the staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"I would first like to strongly reiterate how clean this store is. It was literally the first thing I noticed when I walked in. Holy shit! It's perfectly organised and practically sparkling. 

The only other Korean market I've been to in AZ is in Tucson and that one is tiiiiiny, so in comparison I think Paldo is a moderately sized store with great variety/selection to boot. I actually think they're about equal in price if not slightly cheaper than Lee Lee (err, at least the things I bought were?). Anyway, I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere to buy Korean groceries."}
{"text":"I forgot to mention their meat is so fresh you can get Steak Tartare!  You can also have the lady at the food counter prepare it for you.  OMG  If you haven't tried Korean Steak Tartare(Yook Hwae), you're missing out!"}
