{"text":"Can't say anything bad about this place is clean and warming to stay. The food was fresh and didn't taste frozen or anything. Excellent. Had the shrimp fried rice and general Tao chicken. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent steamed veggie buns. Best in the city."}
{"text":"This place just opened near College and Crawford where Easy Restaurant used to be. The staff is friendly and gave us a few free small dishes (I'm assuming since this was a new restaurant). The food is good for what it is. I am a fan of lamb and was happy to find at least half a dozen or so dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"My partner and I see a woman making dumplings in the window of Northern Chinese Cuisine. The food in the pictures displayed on the windows and doors looks good.

We go inside and sat down. The waitress offers us tea. We accept the offer, and ask for beers as well. We get the beers, while we wait for the tea.

Soon, we make our order. I order (in Mandarin) dry-fried green beans, di san xian (ground three fresh--deep-fried eggplants and potatoes sauteed with green pepper), chive, egg and pork pot stickers, beef rolls, and lamb skewers. 

Within about 10 minutes, the first dish arrives. The green beans are tough, but the flavor is alright.

We get the beef rolls next. They are decent. 

Next, the waitress brings our di san xian. The eggplant looks like mush, and the entire dish is sitting in a pool of greasy soup. The plate looks like someone tried to make the dish for the first time, and failed.

We don't get our tea. 

Our pot stickers come next. We are on our second and third pot sticker, when I detect the familiar crunch of a dried shrimp. I don't say anything, not wanting to ruin the dish for my partner unless I'm sure (my partner's allergic to shrimp). I confirm that the crunchiness I taste in my mouth is indeed dried shrimp.

The lamb skewers arrive last. They mostly consist of the non-meaty part of the lamb--fat and tendon. 

Overall, the only good dish is the beef rolls. 

We are thoroughly disappointed. My partner politely asks for the di san xian to be removed from our bill, as we have left the majority of it uneaten. The waitress gave us $5 off our bill.

On our way home, we pass by another party that was also dining at Northern Chinese Cuisine. \"How was your food?\" I ask one woman of the party. 

\"Salty,\" she replies.

We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Being local to Little Italy, I am always on the lookout for new restaurants on the College St. strip that are NOT Italian patios or Japanese AYCE. We often order Chinese food for delivery from the Annex or other locations. So when Northern Chinese Cuisine opened up shop, I was so excited to give it a try! We got pick-up which was ready in less than 30 minutes. When I picked up, the lady seemed really friendly. The decor doesn't look very exciting, but quite typical for a Chinese restaurant.

We ordered the fried noodles with shrimp (which are Shanghai style, being a Northern Chinese restaurant), eggplant with chili sauce, beef with broccoli, shredded pancake with pork, and fried rice with chicken. The fried noodles and rice were really good. The eggplant was oily and the beef was a little on the chewy/bland side. The shredded pancake (which I hadn't tried before) was very interesting - kind of like noodles but more toothsome. The food was good overall. The bill totalled $46 including taxes. Really great value!

Next time, I plan to try the dumplings and 'buns' (soup-filled dumplings) which are authentic Northern cuisine and seem to be their specialty.

Recommend to everyone looking a good Chinese meal at a decent price point."}
{"text":"Pros:
Legit cheap dumplings. Buns available.

Cons:
Everything else. Low effort.  Exceedingly generic home cooking. Ingredients thickly sliced and diced, noodle drawn in cumbersome gauges. Nothing feelings chopstick calibrated. Morsel size irreverent of optimal volume : surface ratio iterated by generations of Chinese mathematicians. DYE Square cube law? The optimist would say that's fork friendly, but the dishes are not close to restaurant quality. Imagine deciding to stay for supper at your Northern Chinese friend's house, the mom whips up a quick meal after an arduous twelve hour shift. It's totally unremarkable and you say thank you because Confucius raised you right."}
{"text":"the dumplings are awesome. nice family run place."}
{"text":"This place is new and definitely needs to work out some kinks in the service department, but the food is cheap and delicious. We got the fried pancake, greens, and I think ginger chicken. The chicken was braised and the plate was absolutely massive. It took 2 of us 3 days to eat all the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers, I have been waiting for a while for a restaurant like this to arrive in the neighbourhood. I was not disappointed. For the past several months my family has ordered nearly weekly from here. The food is delicious, the prices are incredibly reasonable, and the owners are kind. The highlight is definitely the dumplings--it would be a travesty to order from here without getting the dumplings, they are that good--but all of the broccoli dishes I've tried have been great as have the noodles. Very happy I no longer have to march down to Spadina or Dundas to fulfill my cravings."}
{"text":"I saw this on my way to work one day and thought?  really a northern chinese place in little Italy..hmm let's see if they have some good dumplings.  And sure enough, they have 16 dumplings for $6.99.   They are in-house made and were very tasty.  I can't say anything about the rest of the menu.  But the dumplings were great!  I had the beef ones."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant on blogto, it's in a neighbourhood that does not have a lot of Chinese restaurant options, so we thought we'd give it a try. We ordered the chive and pork dumplings, beef rolls, beef noodle soup, and spicy bone in fried chicken. The fried chicken was really Good - must try! The other stuff were just ok. The service was a little bit slow, but I think its because they are new and family run. They are very nice though, I would probably come back again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Good value, really tasty. Friendly family run affair. Eaten here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. A couple of the dishes are a little on the oily side, but to be expected from this type of chinese food. A welcome addition to Little Italy... definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Please save your stomach and your money. It took the lady 10 minutes to understand what we were ordering. We ordered soup and fried rice and literally could not get past the first spoon full. The food came out awful quickly which means the food was already prepared. The shrimp in the fried rice stunk. We told them the food smells and tastes old and we cannot eat them. They wanted us to pay for food we hadn't touched. They made a scene, no apology. Nothing. We Left $2 for the tea."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading about it on BlogTO. Found it odd that it was in Little Italy as most of these places are in Chinatown. The place looked like it needed a reno or was undergoing on. Decor is nothing to write home about, no style. Even your typical chinatown place looked more put together than this mismatch of furniture and colour. Nevertheless, chinese places aren't typically known for their decor but the food.

Ordered the pork/chive dumplings and beef stew noodle soup. The dumplings were decent. The skin might be a tad thicker than I prefer, but there was adequate fat in the pork to keep the whole moist. It was the right proportion of meat to dumpling wrapper.

When the noodles came, it looked really good. A thick dark broth. Lots of choy. Beef on top. Unfortunately, looking good was all it was. I never tasted a blander stew beef noodle soup ever before. I couldn't believe it could look like so much flavour but taste like water. Not only that, while there were lots of choy, it was definitely not washed properly (or at all) as there were lots of dirt sentiments remaining in each one. We provided the server with the feedback of the lack of flavour and she said she would get a new one. Unsurprisingly, she came back with the same one with probably some MSG added. It tasted slightly better but was still lacking in any broth flavour.

I'm surprised that they could serve this broth the way it is. With the dirt in the choy, it left a bad taste in my mouth of their standard cleaning/cooking practices or lack thereof.

I would give this place 2.5* if I could. Service was decent but the noodles ensured I would only come back for the dumplings, if at all."}
{"text":"I have to say better than expected and awesome addition to the college strip. Very tasty fresh americainized Chinese food. The fried rice wasn't greasy it was a large but not overly large serving fresh and authentic. The general tso chicken was a very westernized in the bright red sweet sauce your used to. Less authentic but delicious mom the less. Would recommend. Not as cheap as china town prices but still reasonable"}
{"text":"A real gem,  very nice family running it happy to explain dishes in detail and make recomendations. The chinease food is the best I have had in Toronto.  It's not overly saucy or greasy or weird just Light and fresh chinease food if there is such a thing this is it. All dishes were very tasty but the Fried green beans and eggplant were amazing. I have never written a yelp review before on principle but honestly these people deserved it and want to make sure they stick around."}
{"text":"Following up after another visit. First off, yes, the owners' English is a bit lacking, and service isn't perfect, but this is completely made up for by the authentic home cooking. the owners are also lovely, if you can get over some language challenges.  This is real northern food, the real deal, not generic Cantonese stuff like you'll find in Chinatown. Tried the Ma Po tofu and it was amazing, tasty and spicy. The hot and sour soup and dumplings are also great. The 5 stars is for people looking for an authentic and delicious meal. It's also amazing value, with low prices and huge portions."}
{"text":"Nice and generous portions, only tried the skewers this time but will come back and try other stuff"}
{"text":"Today was our second visit . delicious noodles , steamed dumplings that were perfectly cooked (still had a bit of chewiness to the dough) and wonderful sweet potato pancakes . we also had the lamb skewers which as mentioned by another reviewer are a lesser cut of lamb , lots of fat and gristle but great flavour , lots of cumin and chilies . i love them but my spouse is not a fan . we'll go back for sure , there are still many dishes we want to try on the menu !"}
