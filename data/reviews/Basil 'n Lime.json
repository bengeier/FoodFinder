{"text":"Possibly the nicest proprietors in town. Love these people. Food's great too. I always have the red curry chicken and chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"first time hear and im very impressed clean area i ordered the beef pad thai yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"Poster child for Americanized Thai food. Hey if that's your thing, then go for it. It's edible and fills your tummy. On the other hand, if you are actually looking for something authentic that'll make your taste buds sing... You'd better look somewhere else. There's really not a whole lot more to say. You've been forewarned."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Three people ordered, two meals initially served.  One was chicken, order was beef. Server took it away and we dined on the first order. Was supposed to be 7 on spice level. No spice detected. Finally two additional meals served. One that was supposed to be beef (served as chicken first time) was supposed to be mild spice was at least a six which was way too spicy for the one that ordered it very mild. Server made the obligatory \"How is your meal\" and made a hasty retreat  when first words of dissatisfaction voiced (twice). Never saw server again until check was hastily sat on table without comment. Will not return!"}
{"text":"This place has good food but is way over priced for what it is.  Archi's is right around the corner and is better service, price, and value. I have tried Basil & Lime numerous times but have decided this was my last- Archi's it is!!"}
{"text":"There are so many things wrong with this place. Should I start with the service? I'll start with the service. The staff is usually preoccupied with chatting or card games when you walk in, so being seated, getting menus and ordering water takes 15 minutes.   The food is mediocre at its best, cold and bland at its worst. We  ordered pad thai, spicy fried rice, chicken satay, tom yum gai (arrived cold), red curry and beef larb. Most of it tasted like nothing, the rest tasted like watered down garlic juice.   The prices are high, especially with the long wait between dishes and the staff walking away before we were finished ordering. Please go to Archi's Kitchen or Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Always within my home 30-45 minutes. Basil and Lime has never botched my order and always arrives hot and fresh at my door. Their coconut/shrimp soup always hearty and never skimp on portions. Location serves brown rice which is always an added bonus asks had friendly delivery service!"}
{"text":"When I found myself on the north side of Vegas, I knew I had to stop in on this place, having read great reviews about it. Looking at the menu I had a familiar feeling as a newly turned vegetarian that I may have to settle for whatever item did not have meat. I was delighted to find that there was a tofu option on the entrees' choice of meat! With my options now limitless I landed on the tofu pad tai. I can safely say I have a new favorite vegetarian friendly hangout."}
{"text":"The \"Pine apple\" fried rice was surprsiningly tastly, although it's hard to justifly paying $12.95  for fried rice at a casual Thai restaurant.  The chicken Pad Kee Mow was also very good."}
{"text":"I love basil and lime. I have been a customer for over 5 years. Everything in their menu is great! My favorite dish was the green curry and I am so sad to hear that they removed it from their menu. We are trying the red curry today! Hopefully it is as good!"}
{"text":"My mom, my son and I stopped in for lunch.  She had been there before and i've always wondered about it.  Service was great, mainly becase we were the only people there.  The scene was nice, I think it would be better if the restaurant was half the size.  Might be better for business.  We ordered the Squid Salad which was the shiznittle bam.  If you like seafood this is a great option.  Great flavors.  We also ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry which was pretty good.  They only brought an extra small bowl of rice.  That wans't to cool.  My son had a good time.  He was flirting with the waitress, playaaaa.  He is 3.  In all, we had a good experience.  I would definately go back.  It would be a shame to let this one go out of business."}
{"text":"Just go to Basil n Lime.  Don't think twice.  Don't fret over which Thai place to choose.  Eat here.  You won't be sorry.    Staff is straight off the boat from Thailand.  Restaurants is brand new.  Nice sleek decor is more cafe style than warm romantic dinner style.  You won't get laid bringing a date here, but you'll experience a momentary reprise from the feeling of hopelessness new residents faces in Las Vegas when trying to find a place that feeds the soul as well as the body.  Yes, this is Las Vegas good, and not LA, NY, SF good.  But it's better than the places that continually get written up here in LV as the 'best' places--Archi's Thai Kitchen(always just average and slightly bland) and Lotus Of Siam(good, but not great)."}
{"text":"Fried rice with crab meat it's amazing !!!!!"}
{"text":"Basil 'n Lime is tucked away in plane sight. One of those places that you go by everyday and never notice. However once you do, you'll never look for another Thai restaurant in this zip code again.   The service is great, the food is fresh and the menu is diverse enough to keep you exploring each time you come in."}
{"text":"Well based on the name and all the pictures of limes in this restaurant, I was sure to get a dumb lime with my pad thai to go....not. Pad thai without lime, simply isn't pad thai. My first time there.  I was craving thai,  pad thai. When I walked in, I was greeted, I mean comfronted by a mean girl.  I ordered. She asked what number heat I wanted, 1 through 10? Well, how hot is 10 I ask? Very hot she said.  Getting no where fast and knowing I like it hot, I asked for a 10.  Got home,  no flipping lime and a 10? Really? I should have asked for my age, 44. Also, when I was sitting there waiting for my food, I saw her looking at me then talking to her coworker... I'm convinced they shat in my food and I still ate it. Sigh. On the plus side the portion was decent but Lord, noodles are cheap! Thinking about it now... my tofu was missing in action....  I'm pretty sure I will be too....never going back."}
{"text":"i dont know if they do their own ped see eww flavouring but it is nothing like the traditional not what i expected they didnt put enough flavor on my order some of the noodles were dry, they can use some improvement to this dish"}
{"text":"It's nice to have found a Thai place that is just a Thai place, and this is a gem. I've tried a few other so-called Thai restaurants only to find some weird combo of every asian cuisine imaginable, usually leaning towards Americanized Chinese food. This place is unpretentious, has a good menu, and reasonable portion sizes. I'm quite particular about how my chicken with chili and basil is served, I like it the traditional way, with minced/chopped chicken and an egg on top, which I can get here, woo hoo!  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because they don't have a liquor license. If you like a beer with your meal, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch here! It was very good. They have tons of options from those who aren't familiar with Thai to those who are really adventuress. They give you an option from 1-10 as to how spice you want it. I got the Cashew chicken with fried rice and a level 4 spicy. I enjoy a hint of spice without sweating while I eat. I could have easily gotten a 5 and still been comfortable while eating, but it was still really good. It was a huge portion, had to take a box home with me. Four of us ate and got an appetizer and it was just over $50. The waitress was really nice and spoke English very well and was able to explain some of the dishes we had questions about. I will definitely be going back next time I am in the mood for some Thai! The image of the three people from the restaurant the woman in the middle was our server."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, quiet Sunday afternoon.  Got the red and yellow curry with chicken, on point.  Kiddo (picky eater) got sticky rice and the waitress suggested to try peanut satay sauce, great suggestion.  Great service, solid food, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Truly below average Thai food. Service was lousy. We had to ask for water more than once. The server never greeted us, simply walked over and asked if we were ready to order. No Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this lovely spot for about eight years.  I love everything I have tried and I get something new each time.  Can't live without their TOM Yum Gai.  But tonight they made me the sweetest sticky rice dessert to go.  I love it here!!  Never too busy, they always treat you like family."}
{"text":"Whoa....what happened to this place? Visited this place often and it was BEST I've ever had ANYWHERE, only to move across town, not visit for 1-2 years, come back with guest relying on my word, only to be embarrassed. Food was average, staff was not attentive, and prices were higher??   I swear I've seen more great restaurants fall from grace in the city of Las Vegas, than any other city I've lived in by far."}
{"text":"Love this place! Clean, quiet, great food and the staff is always friendly. They offer nice lunch specials, and are very accomodating if you want to change up your order. The best Pad See Ew on the Southwest side :)"}
{"text":"Good service.. Appears very clean... And the food is quite tasty!!  The Glass Noodle stir-fry is delicious !!! We also enjoyed the broccoli with tofu.. They have an A rating from the health dept!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had two entrees: Pad Ki Maow with beef, and Lemon grass prawns (see pictures).  The Pad Ki Maow was moist, pungent, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. It had just the right heat to it.  The lemon grass prawns had a sauce that had celery, lemon grass, and bell pepper. If you took out the lemon grass, it would have almost tasted like a cajun dish. The sauce was grainy, and the celery overpowered the flavor. I didn't care for this dish.  We got the pineapple fried rice to go, and this was the real treat. It was so moist, and full of shredded chicken, pineapple, raisins, cilantro, green onion, brown beans.. I intended to save it for the next day, but I scarfed the whole thing down last night. Oops. Good stuff."}
{"text":"pretty good food. very attentive waitress. only issue was i ordered 2 spice. she somehow heard 6 spice.. was a bit much for me. but food was fine for everyone else in my party"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were at Big-O Tires on Spring Mountain and Fort Apache and facing an hour-ish long wait, so we meandered over to a place called \"Basil N Lime\".    Well, I like basil and I like lime.. It happens to be a Thai restaurant and I do like me some Thai food!  The hubby, not-so-much.. so I was met with a groan from him, but still, we both knew that we were hungry and there was nothing else that we were willing to walk to (hubby had injured his ankle, so he was a limper.. no long walks for us that day!).    Anyhow - the Thai iced tea was above average!  It was rich and delicious and really hit the spot.    The dumplings were outstanding... it was the sauce that I LOVED Though!    I think I could have dunked just about anything in that sauce!!   Hubby even like the dumplings!   He ordered the lemon chicken, which had a very hard, over-fried (in my opinion) kind of tempura-esque batter coating.  It was really nothing to write home about.    I had the yellow curry.. silly me, I ordered it \"medium\".. it wasn't spicy enough for me!  Next time I'm saying \"Thai medium\"  not \"American medium\"  (which I think I defaulted to, given my appearance).   Still.. it was pretty darn tasty!  Anyway, the service was pretty good.. the atmosphere is quite nice - open, airy cafe with a pleasing color palette."}
{"text":"Meh. I do not recommend Basil n' Lime for Thai food. I wanted to try a new restaurant out. Now I wish I just went with my original choice. Lesson learned.  I am a big fan of Pad See Ew and Curry so those are typically my orders at every Thai restaurant. At Basil n' Lime, the food was mediocre. The food was not even hot.. Like it's been sitting out for half an hour. Flavors were okay. The curry soup was a bit watery.   Aside from the food, customer service is awful! My cousin and I had never been checked on to ask if we needed anything. I am even upset that the server refilled the other tables waters and not ours! She passed by us like we were invincible. Even when paying our tab and heading out... no comments like \"thank you come again!\" This place obviously do not know how to run a business. Never again."}
{"text":"After reading in the Talk forum recently about where to get the best Thai food in Vegas, my appetite for Thai food was stimulated, so I decided to revisit a couple of my favorite places that received mention in the forum.  At both places I ordered my favorite Thai dish, which is Chicken Panang.  At  Basil 'n Lime, the waitress asked me how hot I wanted the Panang on a scale of 1 to 10, and I opted for 5.  I was satisfied with the spiciness of the dish, and although it was definitely sweet, the sweetness did not detract from my enjoyment.  It came with bell peppers and green peas and only a trace of basil.    (I was a little surprised that the Panang was served with green peas instead of carrots, because other (Chinese/Thai) restaurants where I had ordered the dish in the past served it with carrots.  I don't pretend to know which way is authentic, but I assume that green peas are the authentic ingredient because that is how it was served at Prommares as well.  Anyway, I have no complaints, as I enjoy it either way.)  My friend got the Laos style Fresh Green Papaya Salad.  She was a little disappointed that she couldn't distinctly see or taste any papaya, and thought it would make a better appetizer than entree.  She has had other dishes at Basil 'n Lime that she enjoyed more.  We ordered no appetizers, beverages (other than water), or dessert, and our bill came to only $20 and some change, which I thought was very reasonable.  Located on the corner end of a strip mall, Basil 'n Lime has a colorful, festive facade and a spacious and airy interior.  Pleasant music played softly, and the service was friendly.  The restrooms were clean and easily accessible.    I think most people who like Thai food would find Basil 'n Lime enjoyable and satisfying in terms of taste, price, service, and atmosphere.  I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came with friends because you can bring your own wine. We were not disappointed. Outstanding service! Great menu. A fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pros: The pad Thai is amazing.  Prices aren't too shabby. Very friendly service.    Cons: The decor is kind of a mindfuck. The space is a converted Mexican restaurant so it kind of combines Southeast Asian with Southwestern elements.   Very good restaurant overall, but the only thing I really ever get is the Pad Thai. It is so good. Even if you live in Henderson you should definitely come here to grab some of the Pad Thai. It is so good, I love it to death."}
{"text":"I live near here and eat at this restaurant often. Recently I've been experiencing a food quality less than normal. When I've eaten there in the past it's been delicious now, the last 6 months, it's terrible and it's not with it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places. I usually order the crabmeat fried rice and the chicken pad Thai . The fried rice is always a favorite I can eat it any day of the week . It's flavorful and you can add spice too if you want . I prefer it plain no spice. The chicken paid is also good hubby gets level 5 and I prefer the 7 . The employees are always nice and friendly as I usually order take out. The yellow chicken curry is also a great pick"}
{"text":"Everything was bland. Watered down curry. No flavor in the noodles. The chicken is dry & overcooked. The rice was hard like it had been sitting out. Was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to Thai restaurant.  Service is okay but the food is good.   They make a pretty good Thai Tea I always have to order it when we go there.  My favorite dish is the Panang Chicken (they let you pick your own spice level, be careful though 5 is already quite spicy and you can go up to 10.)  They have a four section spice holder one with chili sauce,  one with crushed chili one with pickled serrano chilies and one with a salt and pepper mix.  This way you could get a spice level of 1 and add more if you would like to make it spicier.  They also make a refreshing Papya Salad, I like that they put whole peanuts in it and not crushed up ones.  The Garlic beef is good too.  When you enter it doesn't look too busy but I have noticed they get a lot of to go orders.  Overall a good place to get a good Thai meal."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials...includes egg roll, crispy wong tong and choice of soup or salad.Fresh, spicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Wonderful family style restaurant the food was amazing and the staff really nice !!! We will be back !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dishes is Chicken Pad Thai. Theirs is fantastic. Another favorite is the Panang Beef. I have always gotten great service whether take out or dining in, staff is ALWAYS friendly. The prices are a little higher than other comparable Thai restaurants in the area but I think the food is worth it.   This is my favorite Thai restaurant hands down :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food cooked by a Thai Chef, fresh and crisp vegetables and great beef, chicken and shrimp. Excellent fast friendly service, This is really the best Thai resturant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food! They took a little while to take our order and entrees came out at separate times. We had a large party which may have affected the service but all in all pretty good. The food was awesome! Will absolutely come back for more"}
{"text":"Of all the thai places I've eaten at in town, this one is probably last on the list. The flavor of the panang curry here is off somehow, and not different in a \"different recipes at different restaurants\" kind of way but a \"this tastes weird, here taste this does this taste weird to you\" kind of way. It also was more like a soup than a curry, which is not what I want.  Ordered my food at the maximum amount of spiciness, tasted like it included zero spicy spices. I had to make extremely liberal use of the spice tray the lady brought out for me.  Service was excellent, the waitress was attentive and very nice. Drinks were kept full and empty plates were taken away quickly.  Even though the service was excellent the food was definitely not, and maybe it's because I'm white that they gave me the \"Americanized\" 10/10 hot level, but that's a complete joke. 10/10 should be ghost pepper status or something, not a dash of cayenne and a sprinkle of red pepper flake."}
{"text":"Archi's on West Sahara and Fort Apache was closed on a Tuesday suffice to say I went here to get a pickup order instead.  Let's just say won't be coming back. Ordered Fried Tofu - super dry and hard, could be used sand down some furniture, Panang Curry Tofu - super spicey after telling them no spice and it seemed that curry powder wasn't watered down too much, Shrimp Pad Thai - superrrrr sallllty, gave me a headache,  Tom Yum - full of veggies and a good amount of shrimp but taste was a bit off.  Wasted $40 tonight, all in the trash. From now on it will be no Thai Dinner nite on Tuesdays.  I was punished by the Thai gods for eating some where else than Archi's and Pink Kaow - my other go to place."}
{"text":"The Pad See Eww is very good here. I like the style it was done. And the seevice is great too. The girls r nice and polite. Not a big place.  But thats what i like. Its not noisy like orher Thai places i know. Im half Thai. So i been around. Will have lunch here again soon."}
{"text":"No! No!  & NO!  I was very excited to try this new neighborhood Thai Restaurant since my fave had closed a couple of years ago. Left after the second bite! The shrimp were older than me!  I actually spit the food out into my napkin - I was that turned off!  They didn't even offer to adjust the check!!! Now I understand why I was the solo diner. An expensive disappointment."}
{"text":"extremely mediocre Thai food....    (tried:  chicken satay, fried fish cakes, pad ki mao, spicy basil fried rice, and shrimp red curry)"}
{"text":"I think they have a new chef because my shrimp pad Thai was overly sweetened and my friends chicken lad nah was bland. So sad."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time this week during lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Inside, the restaurant was bigger than most Thai restaurants.  We were greeted upon entering and seated quickly.  I had the Pad Thai lunch special for $7.95.  You get to choose between the soup of the day (chicken noodle the day I went) and a salad with peanut sauce.  I chose the salad and it was great (then again, I love anything with peanut sauce).  The Pad Thai was a super large portion.  I ended up splitting it in half right then and there to take the other half home for dinner.  It was also accompanied by an egg roll.   Again, service was great -- a super quick lunch -- made it back to work within an hour, even though this place was about 5 miles away.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal and thought I had gotten more than enough food for the price.  I will most likely be coming here again, but next time I'll try something off the regular menu."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Never had a bad meal here - food always delicious and comes out fast.  Love the Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Panang, and of course the Tom Yung Goong. The service has always been good.  Great for dine in or take out.  Still my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Really good and authentic Thai food!  The service was also great. Enjoyed the Pad Thai, pineapple fried rice and both were some of the best I have had. The glass noodle were also enjoyed by my party."}
{"text":"Good food but the service is so so.. the waitresses dont have much of a personality !! Place was empty, they need to be a little bit more lively in there, but the thai salad was good"}
{"text":"Maybe I am losing it, but if this is Thai, I must be the King Of Siam. Shrimp Pad Thai was watery and completely lacking in flavor but they did give eight nice sized shrimp, a pleasant surprise. Chili And Cashew Chicken was a watery mess of flavorless, nice sized chicken slices, decent vegetables, but it was more like something from a sub par Chinese take out joint. There is more spiciness in vanilla ice cream, no kind of chili pepper in the time zone. Tried this place for the first time today. Came home with an MSG rush. The servers were very sweet, but this place seems to be very confused and confusing."}
{"text":"Basil 'n Lime is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas -- I've been there a number of times and it's always very enjoyable.  The food is really good and reasonable considering the portions are BIG, making it a great place to order a few dishes and share them.  The spacious dining room is clean and comfortable and I've always had attentive service.  If you like Thai food, definitely give this place a shot -- I recommend the Pad Kee Mao and the Pad Thai :)"}
{"text":"Tried more than a few things at Basil N Lime thanks to the prices being incredible and my cousin being a huge Thai fan.   First things first, the lunch specials are amazing. Under $9 for a lot of options is damn nice.   So, the things I had: Larb chicken with white rice, pad thai with chicken, papaya salad, both chicken and beef satay, and some steamed dumplings. I know, don't judge me.  Larb chicken I ordered decently spicey, and it was. Chicken was done well, and the veggies/salad was fresh enough. I was a little taken back by the fact there was next to no lime flavor in the dish. Considering that should be apart of the flavor profile of the dish, in the description and restaurant name, you'd think it'd be included? Guess not. Still a good dish regardless.  Papaya salad - not bad. Was decently crunchy and fresh with the ingredients not being mushy. Again, my complaint, too sweet of a sauce and not enough sour from some citrus. This may be a personal thing, but, it's worth noting for those that want some sour with Thai dishes that should have a kick of sour and sweet to them.  Pad thai chicken, ordered at a 5 spicy level - not bad. Noodles were cooked well enough and you got some good slabs of chicken in there, which was very nice. Thought the dish was overly lacking in veggies though, and was just noodles tossed with chicken. Which, isn't overly bad, but, I could have swore pad thai was noodles, veggies and a meat tossed together.   Satays with spicy peanut sauce. Well... they were tough pieces of meat with peanut butter. Very lacking of flavor overall. Very disappointed.  Steamed dumplings were a solid menu item though, especially with the sauce. Was very happy to have gotten these, as it's hard to find steamed dumplings these days with everyone looking to fry or deep fry them. Cabbage on the outside with ground chicken, some spice, and some veggies, good stuff.  Overall, not bad Thai, but, not the best. 2.5 rounded up to 3 for ok."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Sticky tables all around, not the best quality food either. Go 3 miles down to Panna Thai for some real nice food."}
{"text":"I consider myself a huge fan of Thai food. We've tried a number of different locations throughout the city. Basil n' Lime is without a doubt the best value in Vegas.  I honestly believe the food is the same if not a little better than Archies but the pricing and service is much better.  The Tom yung gun is phenomenal and the Pad Thai is the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is that the food is a little inconsistent.  A 6 spicy level fluctuates drastically from visit to visit.  I understand this is very difficult to regulate as a restaurant but other places do it better."}
{"text":"Totally acceptable food quality at the price, clean and soft interior decor.  I think this place happily over delivers at such a decent cost.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Vegetarian friendly/ kid friendly/  Staff is not friendly and you have to be aggressive to get there attention!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here was nice. The food was ok. It wasn't bad, not the best that I've had though. I found the Thai tea to be a little too sweet and thick. The food was just ok. The lady who waited on us was nice but I just felt like her interaction with us was short and not too welcoming"}
{"text":"Ordered Tom Kha soup and the chicken was stale, the coconut milk in the soup was kind of separated from the broth/water part, it was a bit lumpy and the flavors did not blend. The vegetables in the soup were rock hard. I didn't finish mine I threw it out. disappointing. I won't be going back to this restaurant.  If you want to truly remarkable Thai food go to Lotus of Siam in the commercial center."}
{"text":"I do have a high bar on Thai food but not sure this place cuts it on fresh ingredients, presentation or style. Rice was not fresh and basil/spices just didnt have a fresh \"Bite\" like they should. Menu was a bit mainstream...more like americanized Thai then authentic. I love Thai food and will be returning to my couple regular spots. We do have one AMAZING Thai food place in Vegas. Its in the worst possible area next to a raunchy sex club but its the best! just have to be careful when you walk to your car after lol"}
{"text":"I did a take out order of  the Yellow Curry Chicken and it was rather delicious.  The waiter cautioned me on how hot I should get it and since I was new to the joint I stuck with a \"2\".  Nice place, simple decor and very helpful staff.    The guy who served me was so sweet!  :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat at! It's right in front of my apartment for some quick yummy Thai. I liked the pad Thai, basil fried rice and the regular fried rice"}
{"text":"Blown away by this restaurant!   They have awesome options for vegetarians - tofu or veggie instead of meat plates!  We had the lunch specials: one tofu and broccoli and the other tofu mongolian - seriously such amazing flavors and tasted so fresh!!  Even their salad was delicious with a peanut sauce    I would absolutely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the girls. Prices aren't too bad at around $10 for alot of food and a side of soup. I ordered the red curry special and it was very filling and delicious with a lot of flavor. I am not a fan of spicy food, so I asked for a level 2. Other than that this was a typical strip mall cafe with all the good food for an average price."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Love the staff!!!  Very kid friendly!! Our food is always perfect! We get spice level of 10 plus the spice tray!! We love the lunch menu. The salad dressing is so yummy! The soup is always light and perfect!"}
{"text":"What a great place. My Mongolian beef was really good (though could have been hotter). Service was great and everyone was friendly. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It was ok.  The Pad Thai was just ok.  I have had a lot better Thai food in my day.  I usually would do a green curry to try a place for the first time, but it was 111º on the day I went for lunch and just didn't feel like eating something so hot.  The spice level is probably a little low.  I ordered a \"5\" from 1-10 and my wife could have eaten it.  She thinks ketchup is spicy.  Meh."}
{"text":"Love the Thai red curry I have it every time.   The Thai coffee also is very refreshing.   Staff are friendly and food is well priced."}
{"text":"I decided too check new Thai restaurant out. I heard solid reviews and friend lives in area told me good reviews. I love the ambience of the restaurant, the paint color earth tones, plants all around the place, great little paintings all around, spacious open air too it, and lots of tables inside. It in little shopping mall so lots of parking.  I decided too go with the chicken satay friend recommendation. NOT disappointed. Most satay ever had usually two of three pieces of protein want on skewer. The thing that really stood out for me is that one nice long full piece of chicken. Not only that but it was cooked spot on perfection. Perfect on outside, nice moist on the inside, love the marinade it was in, great flavor by itself, and then add peanut dipping sauce. Drop dead awesome. I also added papaya salad too my lunch special (reasonable $2 more) perfect compliment! They have few more lunch specials on the menu so sure count me going back!!   The service was great! The lady greeted me with smile. She asked me if had any questions she would more happy too answer them. I thought nice that she pointed out the lunch specials on the back of the menu. I would never notice if not flip over the menu. She checked up on my meal and never had too worry about my soda being empty.   The soup that comes with the lunch special is fabulous! Hot and sour type of soup with chicken and mushrooms. The price you get lot of food for your money and great place for nice Thai lunch!"}
{"text":"I only give Basil n'Lime 2 stars. The food was horrible. I asked for nothing spicy, but the yellow curry was very spicy, the potatoes and carrots weren't cooked. The beef in the beef salad was over cooked and tough. The sticky rice wasn't even sticky and the Thai fried rice was extremely oily. I won't return to there. Also, I called at 9:20 for a pick up order and the man who answered was trying to say that they were closing soon, which they close at 10 pm. I shouldn't have even ordered."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for Pad Thai. My husband has tried to order multiple other items from their menu but none has really impressed. The Pad Thai however is my favorite in town. I often order to go and for around $15 after tip I have enough for at least two meals. I keep the heat low but the flavors are just right and I imagine if you turn up the heat you won't be disappointed. I have only dined in once because honestly it is normally really slow within the restaurant. I am adding to my review because I had the Sticky Mango Rice. I have never tasted anything like it. So amazing with fresh mangoes! Highly recommend this dessert!! Adding a star for the Sticky Mango Rice itself"}
{"text":"I like coming here for their lunch specials. Well worth the prices. Service is always just ok.. The pad Thai is yummy and always hot and fresh!  I like that it comes with a tasty soup and an eggroll.  The Thai tea is yummy!  Good lunch deals, try it sometime. It's kinda hidden. Always clean and fast!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great service!  Delicious, hot food served quickly.  Family friendly and reasonably priced. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time I came here was a great experience. The food was on point and prices were not overly expensive. My husband got the pad pri king and I got the pad Thai.  Very flavorful and filling.   Second time, we got to go and it was very disappointing. 2/5  Don't know If it was an off night or they just didn't care but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The first and last time I went to this place, customer service was very poor! I mean, the place itself is well decorated, but it seems as if it does not go with the bad service I received! I ordered pad thai and wanted spice added to it. When I received my order, it was just regular noodles. So, I asked them if they can add spice, and they just directed me back to my table and said there was spice that I can add myself! That was downhill for me there."}
{"text":"We founds this place randomly one day and love it. It's one of our go to places. The food is amazing. Must try!"}
{"text":"Always super nice and super helpful! Tom yum gai soup is my favorite with chicken, great for when I'm sick and all other times too! They deliver and always are always on time! I order from them all the time"}
{"text":"We came here years ago with our friends who live here and loved it and now we're back for dinner with them!  We started off with fried calamari and pork skewers, both delish.  Then we ordered separate entrees as our friends don't usually share their entrees:  beef noodle soup, sweet and sour chicken, ground chicken stir fried and stir fried glass noodles with chicken.  All were so good and plentiful and since we didn't share, we had to give our leftovers to our friends since we are visiting and don't have a refrigerator in store in our hotel room.    Prices are very reasonable, food is tasty, place is clean and service is attentive!"}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad at all, but it is far from being Thai.  Rather it is Thai inspired, and adapted for western tastes.  I had the Pad Kee Mow, one of my favorite noodle Thai dishes.  There wasn't any Chinese Broccoli in it, but some carrots, green beens, green bell peppers, and onions.  That isn't authentic.  I couldn't imagine the noodles and the sauce pairing well with Chinese Broccoli, and so I can only conclude that the entire dish was purposefully transformed to suit the tastes of the average person.  If you are not looking for authentic Thai food, but something that isn't bad tasting at all and pretends to be Thai, then this might be a good place for you to try.  The atmosphere is very nice, and it is in an upscale neighborhood.  The service was very delightful.  However, since I review Thai based on authentic taste, I have to give Basil 'n Lime a measly 2 stars.  Thanks for the spicy American food!"}
{"text":"Best crab rangoons ever! So good!! Will be back! Service was great and food came out quick and promptly. The waitress was nice as well. Pad Thai was amazing."}
{"text":"My sis and I stopped in before going to a show.  I forgot how awesome their satay chicken with peanut sauce is.  Then my sis had pad thai with shrimp which she loved, I tasted it --yummy -- ask for extra peanuts - delicious!  I had the spicy eggplant with chicken with sprigs of basil -- that dish is so good.  the spice just right.  The eggplant almost tastes like meat.  I love the open laid back seeting.  You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Just ordered via Postmates so I don't know how the place is inside but the food was amazing. Great taste, fresh and excellent prices. Try the pineapple rice and any curry."}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly people.. but a bit expensive."}
{"text":"After my first visit, it was clear why a friend of mine recommended Basil 'n Lime to me: the food is wonderful.  Finding the restaurant wasn't difficult, but for first-time visitors, note that it sits back from the road in a store front.  Keep your eyes pealed and you won't miss the bright \"Basil 'n Lime\" sign mounted high on the front.  I've visited for lunch, dinner, and a few times in between and have never seen the placed very busy.  If you see the same thing when you arrive, don't let the lack of a large crowd fool you: go in, take a seat and enjoy.    For a relatively small restaurant, the menu has quite a bit of variety.  I've sampled something from every part of the menu except the \"Top Secret\" section and nothing failed to satisfy.  The food is authentic Thai cuisine, cooked fresh when ordered, and many of the meat dishes will accommodate your preference for chicken, beef or seafood.  Finally, the customer can specify their preference for heat (spicy) on a 1-10 scale.  Noteworthy about this is across my visits, the spiciness of the dishes I order is consistent: a seven this time is equally hot as a seven the next time.  I've also varied the heat of a dish to see if it makes a difference.  The cooks truly vary the heat as requested.  If you're a fan of authentic Thai food, give Basil 'n Lime a try.  I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Basil and Lime is one of the few Thai food places in Vegas that I have found that gets the spice and flavoring right on most of their dishes. A lot of Thai places out here claim to be Thai, or Chinese food that offers Thai, but they always lack in flavor. Bland and basically every dish tastes the same. Basil and Lime has some great dishes. The Pineapple fried rice is really good as is the pad Thai noodles. I wish I still lived close to this place. It used to be a weekly staple for my diet."}
{"text":"Because of a Yelper picture, I was craving for the thai salad... very spacious restaurant located between Fort Apache and Twain. 7/11 parking lot We were welcome right away. Clean, simple deco. like usual I ordered more than I can eat we got lucky we were able to order the lunch menu chicken lard  pad thai no meat pas see ew mongolian beef since i didn't know how spicy they cook, i ordered level 4... Gosh it was spicy!!! so go for level 2 if you expect just a kick lol with the lunch menu you get a mini soup or a side salad peanut dressing"}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced. There's a ton of other thai places nearby which have a way cheaper menu and the quality of the food is the same. Their decor is definitely top notch though."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  Really good red chicken curry. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from here several times. The food is OK but the billing is sketchy. If you pay cash, be sure to specifically ask for a receipt when you order. There is a $3 delivery charge and tax but no receipt if you pay cash. Check their math and make sure they give an accurate bill. They WERE on Dirty Dining despite what some reviews claim."}
{"text":"Love going to Basil N Lime, always hits the spot. My favorite dishes to order are the Crab Pad Thai and the Yellow shrimp Curry, both at a level 6. A good appetizer would have to be the Chicken satay, which also comes with a small portion of cucumber salad. Everything is always good, every time i go there, highly recommend.   I hate have to edit his review... I dont know what happened to this place. but total lack of consistency.I usually get crab pad thai, but now the pad thai is overly greesy and the crab meat is barely there you cant even taste it over the overdone scrambled eggs. The yellow curry  is also not as tasty, its almost watery. I need to figure out which day the chef I like is working.."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food is great with reasonable price. I like the ambiance & the music is very mellow. However, I think it needs a brighter lighting. Overall, it's a good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I love basil and lime! I go there about once a month with a friend, and their food is consistently great, and the servers are always attentive and sweet! I think I'll call in a to-go order of Panang Curry right now!"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable and CLEAN! Decently priced and delicious... I had green curry and it was so yummy.  Crab Rangoon and egg rolls were also just as satisfying!  Don't forget the Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Small little place with great Thai food! They're not too busy and the service is always good. Their prices are not bad and the food is very good for the price. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My first visit. I live nearby and ordered Seafood Pad Thai to take out, spicy level 7,  Just a bit more spicy than I should have ordered. But still flavorful, lots of good seafood. Crab leg, mussels, prawns, squid, etc. nice portion, every bite had seafood.  Looking forward to trying more from the menu."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from BnL and I eat there often. The reason I'm posting this review is because of the experience I just had. I ordered one of their lunch specials which came with an egg roll. When I bit into the egg roll I felt something really hard. At first I thought it was a bone but then realized there shouldn't be any bones in an egg roll. I saw that it was a 3/4 inch bolt.     I informed the waitress about it and her reaction was priceless. I won't repeat what she said but it made me chuckle. Unfortunately the management didn't do anything about it. It seemed as though they wanted to ignore the situation. I barely got an apology from the waitress and a scoop of ice cream for free.     If it were anywhere else I'm sure I would have at least gotten the meal for free if not somewhat of a discount.    If I weren't a nice person I could have taken a picture of, if not the actual egg roll and contacted a lawyer. But I figured it was an accident and chalked it up to just that.    But when I asked if the egg rolls were pre-packaged or hand made they informed me that they are made fresh in the restaurant. I could understand something like that being passed up by inspection from a conveyor belt, but what I don't understand is how a 3/4 inch bolt was overlooked if they were rolled by hand. Hmmm.    I was afraid of my lunch from that point onward. It could have really done some damage.    I will probably patronize BnL again being that I REALLY love Thai food and the quality of their food isn't all that bad... normally."}
{"text":"My go to for delivery! Quick service and always tasty. BNL fried rice is more than a meal on its own. Great place for casual dinner out too. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday and was a little disappointed. I ordered the larb chicken, chicken satay, and papaya salad. The larb had no citrus taste (and the place has lime in the name?) and had too much of a sweet taste. I'm guessing they use larb seasoning instead of making it from scratch (that's how it tasted to me at least). The chicken satay was just okay and the spicy peanut sauce wasn't spicy at all. I've had authentic Thai food and this is far from it.  The papaya salad was the only great thing that came from this experience. It was delicious! - The staff is very friendly as well and the atmosphere is really nice. I just wish their food was less \"americanized\". Maybe their cooking was off yesterday, so I might give it another try."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch special to go. Got my order and went back to my office to discover no cutlery, napkins, soy sauce, etc., in the bag. The pad thai was alright, but the chicken was a little tough."}
{"text":"Repeat offender recently.  See:  KTNV 'Dirty Dining' segment.   Have not eaten here, but received mailers and had thought about trying it out. That will not happen anytime soon.  Today, they have still not fixed all issues."}
{"text":"What a coincidence that this place is called Basil 'n Lime because I walk in and the my first thought was 'Oh! it smells like lime...!'  The restaurant itself is pretty large with modern-ish decor in comparison to other Thai restaurants. They have strings of Christmas lights up in an artsy fashion. It ain't Christmas, but tis the season - it works with the overall feel of the restaurant. The boyfriend and I walked into an empty restaurant with the exception of a party of 6 finishing up their meal on a Saturday night. We were greeted by one of the waitresses and seated at a table.   We ordered Thai tea, beef pad see ew, and chicken ginger and mushroom. The thai tea kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It tasted super powdery but this is most likely because I didn't mix well enough. We waited for a while before our dishes were brought out to us. We're very patient people but for us to wonder when our food will be at our table is a tell tale sign that they're taking way too long. Annoying, since we were essentially the only ones in the restaurant. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured they were making our food ultra fresh.  What we didn't realize when ordering was that their portions (at least for dinner) are huge! The two dishes were pretty good. Not the best we've ever had, but we had no major complaints. The chicken ginger and mushroom is quite misleading by name. The dish didn't have that extra bite of ginger I was searching for. Where were the mushrooms? They were hiding and didn't want to come out. There were a lot of other veggies though - carrots, onions, bell peppers. Good portion of chicken, which I appreciated. The beef pad see ew had a good amount of beef as well. They definitely don't shy away from your protein portions! Basil 'n Lime serves their pad see ew with regular broccoli. Perhaps this is consumer's preference but I definitely like my pad see ew with Chinese broccoli, not regular American broccoli. I feel as though Chinese broccoli gives the ample amount of crunch that a chewy dish such as pad see ew really needs. Both dishes were at a heat level of 5/10. I'll tell you what - heat level 5 barely scratched the capsaicin receptors on my tongue! If you like medium-spicy as I do, you should probably bump it up a notch to a 6, maybe a 7 if feeling a little brave.   I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner anytime soon. But I hear they have great lunch specials. I'm more than open to take a stab at one of those if given the time and opportunity."}
{"text":"The place has the best food in our part of town. The green chicken curry is out of this world when it comes to exciting my taste buds. I only gave the place 2 stars because if you have your food delivered, the company will charge you 2 delivery fees!!! Which I think is outrageous. Gas prices have gone down and to charge 2 delivery fees for the same order left a bad taste in my mouth.  But as I said to begin with... Great food!! So dine in to avoid the 2 delivery charges."}
{"text":"I was hungry for Thai in an unfamiliar neighborhood.  Decided to check this place out even though reviews were mixed. I ordered the green curry lunch special. Hands down the best green curry I've had in the three years I've lived in Vegas. Absolutely awesome. Exactly the spice level I asked for, tons of meat and veggies and not too oily. The lunch special came with soup or salad, and the soup I had was hot and sour--also excellent. Their health Dept rating was an A. I checked. Overall it was a great meal, and HUGE portions. So much food that there are enough leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"I Always come here for Thai food! I've been to several Thai places out here... Including Archi's, and to be honest, the pad thai here is the most flavorful. Service is always excellent and some of the workers know what's up when my girlfriend and I come through. Also it's a really nice and quiet kind of place.... Not too hectic and loud like some other Thai places in las vegas. I highly recommend this restaurant! Also their lunch specials are awesome and very generous."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery a few days ago, and really enjoyed it.  We got: Steamed Dumpling (good, but not great, and strangely horrible the next day) Mongolian Beef (my brother's dish - he liked it, said it was good) Sauteed Mixed Vegetable (my dish - nice flavor, came with steamed rice which was well done) Crab Rangoon (my mom's - a nice appetizer, well done, on the sweet side which is how it's supposed to be) Chicken Satay (my mom's - the favorite dish of the evening)  All that was $54, not including tip for the delivery guy. A little pricey, especially since it was mostly just vegetables and rice. It took about 30 minutes for delivery, which wasn't bad.  Overall, I felt that the ingredients were fresh, the quality was nice, and nothing was too spicy but it was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Ignore the review saying this restaurant was on dirty diners.  It must have been previous owners. I checked online and currently they have an A rating.  The good is always fresh and delicious.  My wife and I have tried different dishes and they are always excellent.  Customer service is great. We need more small businesses like this!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here and was surprised how good the food was.  The setting is very nice and cozy.  Service is great.  Great variety of food."}
{"text":"Super great Thai place! They are always very friendly and quick with making the food. The pad Thai and Red Curry are my go to and highly recommended. The only thing I wish they would do is give bigger portions of rice with the meals."}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch special and couldn't find any chicken?! Had all of 3 small pieces in my lunch plate w/ all veggies. So disappointing  note to self - check my plate before leaving!"}
{"text":"Second time we've been here, ordered 3 different dishes each time and everything has been so good. We loved the war wonton soup, the Pad kee mao was amazing! We ordered our dishes with a medium heat and left our mouths spicy!! Very very yummy and the staff is super friendly and sweet. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  The staff were very friendly and attentive. We had a party of four all of  us ordered different lunch specials....really a great deal. The Thai Tea was awesome ...the restaurant is also decorated very well. All in all a very enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"As soon as I sat down you can hear the kitchen staff bickering over the music.  Once my entree arrived (Chicken Larb) the servers only came back to my table to give me my check. They didn't check on us once. Even after we made eye contact. The Larb had too much onion and rice powder. It was way too gritty. I finished a 3rd of it."}
{"text":"I love this place for take out. They always have my food done quickly, and the portions are generous.  I was not impressed with the dine in service. I got my food spicy, and kept having to drink my wife's water because they rarely came to fill mine. Also when this location is busy it is very loud inside.  Great take out try the Pineapple Fried Rice. My Favorite!"}
{"text":"Love this joint.  I do take-out lunches here at least once a week or every other.  I usually have the Chicken Pad Thai, Yellow and Red Curries.  Sometimes I'll throw in sticky rice and papaya salad.  I've always been happy with the food here."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The pad thai with chicken ($9.95) was a solid rendition of the classic dish but not good enough to think it's any different from the million other Thai places that serve it. The ginger and mushroom chicken ($9.95) was heavy on the celery, light on chicken and extremely bland. There was absolutely no depth to their sauce at all. The place might be decent if you live really close by and need a Thai fix, but it's not a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"I went today for the lunch special. Pluses  - they offer lunch specials every day, even weekends. I had the chicken pad Thai 7/10 heat. It was very good and fresh and the chicken was well trimmed breast meat.  I liked it a lot.  The soup that comes with the lunch was broth with a lump of ground chicken and some carrots and cabbage. Meh. Delicious papaya salad for $2 more. Yum. The service was good, very attentive. I also had a Thai iced coffee, which was incredibly sweet. Way too much. I have never had it before, so this may be normal.   I would rate this closer to a 3 1/2, if possible.  The portions are huge, way more than one meal."}
{"text":"Ordered off the lunch menu and got a big heap of tasty food for a reasonable price. We also tried mixed satay and the beef was really good but a little greasy. Also, I may be a complete weenie but the food is SPICY! My pad thai was a 3, but it made me sweat.  My bf's 5 kung pao burned my gums. And a definite plus: free soda refills!"}
{"text":"Went there probably 2 or 3 pm on a Sunday so its expected to be kind of dead, which it was. Started with chicken skewers, they were good, but had a weird smell. Next was the pork pad thai, not really my taste. The pork definitely tasted weird, and it looked way sloppy, ie the noodles were broken into pieces. The place is nice however, the staff is super friendly, and a clean bathroom :)."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Red Curry with Tofu.  Most places only have a few diced up veggies, but they give large chunks, I feel like I get a nice bang for my buck!  Lunch special comes with soup or salad, a wonton and an egg roll..say what, yup...its true!  And the egg roll is a veggie roll!  Woo hooo!!!  Customer service is very kind.  They always provide the name of the person that ordered the dish on the to go box so when the 5 bags of food that I ordered for my coworkers is picked up, I can divide it up with no problem!"}
{"text":"Basil 'n Lime is located just east of the Flamingo and 215. Being a skeptical Thai consumer (as noted in another review, I've been ruined by perfect Thai food in Chicago), I walked in with one eyebrow raised. To my initial delight, I loved the \"limey\" atmosphere. Dark wood highlighted by lime napkins gave this place a natural, open air feel.  The menu is extensive and includes all of the staples you would expect.  I got the Pad Kee Maow. It had a rich, spicy, basily sauce which was better than your average \"suburban\" thai place. My hubby got the Pad Thai. It was tasty, and had a lighter sauce than I usually experience. Often, Pad Thai sauce can be a little over the top, so this was nice. The service was friendly and accommodating.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Okay, so it was our first time ordering from here and i lovee lovee lovee thai food. So i told my husband to place an order for pickup. Okay he ordered cool. When he got home with our food. We had ordered 5 items. 2 soups, 1 beef broccoli, Mongolian beef and beef salad. We paid 50$ for the food. It was disgusting. Every item we ordered had a nasty smell and taste. If i knew it would of been 50$ i would of went to KUNG FU. And paid the same amount for food that i know for a fact is good. Honestly i didn't even eat it. We threw it out and i threw out 50$ out of my pocket. I do not recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"I order from this place on a regular...the last few times they messed up my order. This time was the last straw. How does one forget rice with entrees? I called them and they were sending someone over with it. Took them almost an hour for the rice. My food was getting cold (who likes cold food?!!!!!?) I paid good money for hot food! I called them back and the lady said \"oh we give you extra rice\". I don't care about the extra rice! Why don't you make me another order? If it was any other restaurant they would've sent out another order. Bad customer service! Never again.."}
{"text":"This has been on my radar for some time, but I never thought to go here.  This afternoon, it was a planned event all along.  The restaurant is really decorated nicely.  The layout is good and I liked it from when I walked in.  There was one couple in the restaurant when I came in.  At first I thought they were closed.  I ordered and got a Thai iced coffee while I was checking in on Yelp and looking over the menu.  Not wanting to fall back on curry again, I decided on something completely different for me - the garlic, pepper with chicken - spiciness level 7 out of 10.  The dinner was very good.  It's served with rice - I took the white rice.  The portion was too much to finish and my server packed the leftovers in two containers.  The spiciness could have been higher.  I should have asked for some hot peppers.  From the Yelp reviews, I thought they were heavy with the hotness, when for my taste, they are not.  8 or 9 next time.  The garlic flavor was very good!  Service was quite good!  I would expect no less when there are only 2 tables with customers in the whole place but I've had other experiences with the same circumstances.  I will come back here, and I think their garlic will get my wife's seal of approval!"}
{"text":"It's within walking distance from my house, which is the only reason I keep going back. Their yellow chicken curry (which is the only thing I get from Thai restaurants) is decent. . . but it's no where close to the best I've ever had and it's more expensive then alot of other places. The decor is pretty, the staff is friendly enough, but nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"I ate here once and was hooked. While they don't make the food as spicy as I'd prefer, even after you ask them to make it spicy and a \"10\", the Thom-Kha-Gai is great.  The best part about this place is that they deliver, and even being up in Summerlin I could count on to bring me my yummy goodies and make my tummy warm and content."}
{"text":"I've only been a few times for lunch and the food has been good but the service was a little slow or inattentive at times making it hard to get in and out in under an hour.  The Crying Tiger is well worth a try.  The chili lime sauce is fantastic."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly people, large portion and good price! What else can you ask for in a neighbor hood Thai place!!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant for about 3 years now and am hooked on the Tom Kha Koong soup (coconut, lemon grass, shrimp soup).  Fair warning though when asked how spicy on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 will be VERY HOT!!  Even a 7 can be EXTREMELY HOT... if you do ask for it is on the spicier side of the scale keep in mind that you may not want to actually eat the peppers in the soup.  We will usually get a side of steamed rice to mix into the soup, which is also a very yummy way to enjoy the soup.  Sometimes I've noticed the restaurant will put tomatoes in the soup and other times they do not.  Out of the appetizers as someone who likes tofu a lot, I did not care for their deep-fried tofu appetizer, but have found that I do really enjoy the shrimp roll.  The shrimp roll goes nicely with peanut sauce and the sweet chili sauce mixed together.  I cannot really comment on the other entree's because I am hooked on the Tom Kha Koong and would have to say this restaurant makes the best version of this soup I've ever had between Thai restaurants in California, Nevada and Arizona."}
{"text":"Placed a order for delivery they told us 30 minutes. After a hour goes by we call them and they tell us the driver was in a accident. Driver shows up 10 minutes later and when we ask him if he's okay from the accident he laughs. We check the food and it's cold and soggy. We take the food back and ask for a refund or for our order to be remade. While we're waiting he tells us the driver is new and must of got pulled over. Weird thing is I have been ordering from there for a few years and it's been the same driver. They issue us a refund and tell us we can keep the food we returned. We told them we don't want cold and soggy food. Never eating there again. Looks like we will be going to Archi's. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"This place falls into the \"Twilight Zone\" of Thai Food.  It's not in a class with either Archi's or Lotus of Siam, but you will get a good meal, very personable service, and the prices are very affordable.   Their Papaya Salad is fair, and it's just okay for what I call \"American Favorites\" for Thai food are better than most places in town. I have done well staying with the Chicken Dishes, my friends have tried a variety of other entrees, and seem to be satisfied.   My son is impressed with the quality of the Thai Iced Tea.  Overall, you won't be raving when you leave, but you will not feel that you made a mistake, and you won't feel that you overspent.  It is very large, so you probably won't wait for a table, so it's good for groups.  For a date? Maybe just lunch. Go to Archi's or Lotus for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Service: Great Food: Good  Restaurant: Nice Decor. More concentrated on lime than Thai lol Return Visits: Yes Favorites: Pad Thai, Tom Yum (Shrimp), Stir Fry Basil, Calamari.  We've been coming here for about a year now and we really like it here, most especially because it's really close to our house lol. You're always greeted the moment that you walk through the door, service is great, they're very attentive, the quality of the food is good. It's a bit 'Americanized', as far as decor and taste... I think that makes sense? Ugh.  I knocked one star off because they don't refill Thai Tea, BOO!!!"}
{"text":"One of my husbands favorite places but the last time that we were there they had done away with the little chilies which he loves. I like the pineapple rice-it is really good"}
{"text":"Well tonight I will be going to bed early.  Thanks to the unbelievable dinner I had last night at Basil 'N Lime.  I woke up at the crack of dawn to the reminder of the delicious leftovers that were calling to me from my refrigerator.  This quaint establishment is enormous in flavor.  The fresh vegetables were sautéed yet crisp, the meat was as tender as eating cotton candy.  Starting out with the eclectic plate of appetizers was a trip to heaven.  The spice rating is a scale from 1-5.  I always treat my spice ratio as if I'm putting together an outfit.  In the words of the famous fashion designer Coco Channel...it is easier to add than take away.  The entrees were ordered as a  three.  The delectable flavor of the food was not hidden in the heat.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their tempting choices.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol.  Which is a blessing in disguise.  You would not want any of your senses denied the aroma, taste and presentation of this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.   To top it all off, I can sleep sounding because I know that their Garlic Beef is only a phone call away because they do deliver.  My hat's off to you, Chef Moo and your staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for takeout. The server was nice and the food was pretty quick considering we didn't call ahead. I got Pad Thai, spicy level 5 (1-10), and my husband got the combo fried rice, spicy level 5. We also shared the fried wonton appetizer.   The Pad Thai and fried rice portions were huge! The Pad Thai had good flavor, plenty of chicken, and was more like a level 7 spicy. I had to stop a few times because my nose was running from the spice.   The fried rice was delicious, also had plenty of meat, and wasn't too spicy. The wontons were okay, not quite enough filling, but came with good dipping sauce."}
{"text":"the thom kha ghai soup here is the best, not too sweet, seasoned just right, they don't skimp on the chicken in this soup either! hits the spot on a cold winter day. everything is always fresh and delicious, and the service is always friendly and warm, one of my favorite Thai places and my absolutely favorite for the thom kha ghai soup!"}
{"text":"Authentic yummy thai food. Taste awesome and big portions. Short drive from the stripe & airport, took around 13 minutes."}
{"text":"Their thai tea is just right, not too sweet. I love going during lunch hours for the specials. I love pad see ew! The side salad tastes very good! Especially the dressing. When the waitress asked me how spicy I want my dish (1-10) I asked for 4, I can tolerate some spicy. But when it arrived, it was too hot for me. I figured afterward they use the scale to ask how many chilies to put in the dish?  I think I'll go for a '2' next time haha. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Been here plenty and the food is always very consistent.  Flavor is perfect and the ambience is relaxing.  This is our top rated Thai restaurant in town as I tried them all from Henderson to Summerlin and they never disappoint when it comes to food selection.  Panang Chicken is always amazing here,  perfect blend of peanut and coconut flavors. Ask for level 1 for heat and add it in yourself if your not sure how hot you like it.  Thai BBQ Chicken, no issues here, flavor is plentiful and dipping sauce was not needed.  Papaya Salad only had a hint of fish sauce which is a plus.  Other places emphasis on too much fish sauce and not enough lime or lemon juice. Best I had so far.  Service is mediocre which knocks off one star. So come for the food and you'll enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Been here twice, Good deals during lunch time, $7-$9 for a meal with a side of salad/soup.  Service is good. Constantly checked on us, were friendly, and were great on refilling our drinks. The weird thing is that the food isn't too spicy. You can pick from a scale of 1-10 for the spice of your food, and I was surprised to find that I could handle a 7 (I'm a weak sauce when it comes to spicy food! A few Hot Cheetos and I'm drinking a gallon of milk).   First time I came was great- The second time I came here, I found that the food was extremely sweet.. The pad thai and even tom yum was more sweet than sour. My friend said the curry tasted as if he was \"drinking thai tea...\" So I'll dock off a star there. But they do have spices and peppers on the side for you to add.  Both times I visited, it was really just my party and one other in the big dining area, which is spacious and beautifully decorated. Other than the sweetness, it's enjoyable and a great deal for lunch.  I just can't understand why it's called basil 'n lime when it's not found in many of their recipes.. Cute name for a store though!"}
{"text":"One of my fave Thai joints! Taste is very authentic! Like you can't go wrong with this place at all.   Usually order papaya salad and they can even make it Laos style (which isn't on the menu anymore) but I've been coming here for years when they did. Would recommend to anyone looking for legit Thai food!"}
{"text":"Wow. Super delicious takeout! We had excellent pineapple fried rice. Red curry and the star was the freshest papaya salad I've had in vegas!  This will be our staple for Thai food now!  Super fast delivery with Postmates. Thank you basil n line! We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"We probably should have looked for the health code posting before eating here.  They were given a C and for good reason I'm sure. We will definitely not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I was really hoping I would like this place because it's closer to my home than my favorite Thai spots. I Pad kee mao and shrimp rolls. The shrimp rolls were okay. The Pad Kee Mao tasted ok too, but the noodles were clearly old. Okay taste I can live with, but old food is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food that I've ever had!  We're really, really picky about our Thai food and Basil 'n Lime is as authentic as they come.  The pad thai (both chicken and tofu) are fabulous, as are their spring rolls, and red curry.  Just a few of our favorites!  The staff is also amazing....well mannered, courteous and always one step ahead of you.  What always amazes me is that whether or not my husband is with me, one waiter always remembers that I need a pad thai with chicken done spicy to go.  I never have to remember...he'll always ask!   And when I arrive before my take out's ready, they're always there with a glass of ice water and a kind smile.    Love, love, LOVE this place!  Even though we're moving across town next month we plan to make the trek back to their restaurant often."}
{"text":"Boss and I tried Basil 'n Lime after a meeting last week, cruising back to work but looking for lunch. I spotted this new little place and we decided to give it a go, not knowing anything about it. \"I hope its good...\" was my last peep before walking in. We were so pleasantly rewarded. The soup they serve (on-the-house appetizer) was tasty to start with, a good sign. I had the Masamun Curry/Chicken - absolutely fantastic. And huge portions. Also, have to reiterate that the staff was very sweet. In all, a dining treat and I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Red curry was delicious. Also the pad thai was very good! Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to give this place a try but never had the chance because I live really close to a Thai Place that I like to frequent. Me and my husband went out of our way to eat here but were disappointed.  I ordered the Pla Goong means grilled shrimp salad that had red onion, tomato, cilantro, lettuce, sliced lemongrass in spiced lime sauce. It was overly sour it made my eye wince when I first took a bite out of it. My husband had his usual Beef Thai Salad. My husband said he didn't like the way they made their beef salad here because the meat wasn't cooked enough.  The food was okay but what I was really bothered by is that it was hard to get someone to give you a refill on your drink. The food is spicy ..it should be common sense to keep the drinks coming. I saw that my husband really needed a drink because he was crunching down on the ice in his empty glass. I felt bad for him so I told him there was a drink machine in the corner. I usually wouldn't encourage him to get his own drink but if he didn't who would? One of the workers noticed my husband getting his own drink so she took a hint and kept the beverages coming but it was a little too late because the meal was just about done. I didn't even want to stay for dessert and that is a rarity!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place with my cousin who seen this place near his house and decided to give it a go. Nice looking place but kinda looks like it has a western theme. Service was quick and friendly. We proceeded to order the Thai beef salad, chicken pad thai, catfish chilli, and panang chicken curry. For the price you do get a good amount of food compared to some other places. After trying all the dishes we had ordered there was some mixed feelings. The beef salad was excellent, the pad thai and cat fish were good and the panang was kind watery and not as tasty as other places. I would come back to this place if I lived in the area"}
{"text":"Some food was good and some wasn't. Also felt like I paid more than it was worth. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this Thai place since it opened and Ive always gone back to this one. The Tom Yum Gai is amazing and the spice level is always perfect. The restaurant used to be a mexican place and they just decorated to the mexican lime green vibe by naming it basil n lime. The only complaint that I have is that it is somewhat over my budget for take out."}
{"text":"Was excited to try it. Was disappointed. Vietnamese ice coffee too sweet. Had to try there dinner menu and had the orange chicken. Very small portion. Less then 3 ozs. Server was just talking with owner or other servers but her back was to the table most of the time. Did ask if they can fix my ice coffee nope its a mix!! Wtf? I use to serve at a restaurant with 6 tables and still had to brew coffee for customers. That's nuts and lazy!"}
{"text":"Nice spot with great food and good service! It's cozy inside and the food is always consistent! This has become our go to spot!"}
{"text":"I really like Thai Food so I recommended ! This place and should order Pad Thai! I am quite sure that is more delicious than Thailand!!!!! Hungry...:)"}
{"text":"Waitress friendly, ate lunch there, prices very reasonable but no beer is served Curry chicken #6 very good but salad dressing was too sweet Overall I rate 4 stars"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place so I finally drove over for lunch to get some food to go-- I ordered the chicken pad thai- it was pretty good... better than some i have had. The restaurant was cute and clean. It's pretty close to where I live so I might give them a second try. BTW 3 stars means A-OK."}
{"text":"This place is good....if you've never had thai food in your life before.    To top off the high prices of this place, i ordered the beef salad and the meat was extremely dry and tasteless, the crab fried rice tasted like something i could make at home with rice egg and crab meat, no additional flavor what so ever.  Go to archis or surangs if you're in the neighborhood.  Or better yet KING AND I"}
{"text":"Just not a good meal. EVERYTHING was sweet, the yellow curry really lacked flavor and did I mention everything was sweet.  Well, I take that back, the crab rangoon was very good.  Yellow Curry, Tom Yum Koong, Shrimp Pad Thai were ordered.  Hopefully just a bad night for the kitchen."}
{"text":"Delicious and tasty!! The staff was very friendly and attentive:) I ordered and highly recommend their glass middle salad! I give this place a 10!! It was very delicious and the prices were amazingly affordable. Order the Thai coffee and pad that and pad se ew! So delicious coming back next week."}
{"text":"We went here on a not-so-busy, late Sunday dinner for the first time because we are craving some Thai and this place was 2 minutes away. We were not disappointed.   It was my first time having Papaya Salad and it was dressed perfectly. The vinaigrette was savory with a little bit of sweetness and the shredded papaya was crisp and fresh . Not a big fan of the Beef Jerky, but the rest of the family enjoyed it. The Chicken Panang Curry, with its peanutty, coconutty, sweet-savory flavor, was out of this world! Just the curry itself with the cup of rice was a perfect meal by itself! Egg rolls are... egg rolls - it can't be messed up, but perhaps Thai egg rolls are just not my preferred egg rolls. I'm also not too much of a fan of the price (because I'm admittedly frugal) but with the quality of the food I really don't have the right to complain. ;]  Service was excellent! We were seated immediately. We were given ample amount of attention. Our waters were never empty. The servers were nice and to the point.  Overall, for our first time, this place is definitely recommended to satisfy Thai food cravings. We're glad we tried this neighborhood restaurant (as opposed to the usual Archi's - which we still love!), and we will definitely be back! :]"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was really good!I love it!And I asked for level 1 Panang Curry and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"GO HERE. ORDER PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE AND GREEN TEA. ENJOY.  If you're a sissy make sure not to order anything over a 3 in spiciness. The decor isn't that great and the staff isn't extra phenomenal but this place is perfect for lunch and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Lunch specials.  Compared to other thai restaurants, I think this one is okay.  I used to frequent the location more often than I do now, but it seems that the quality of the food has diminished a bit. Not my favorite, but still good."}
{"text":"I don't know why but the food here just doesn't satisfy my Thai food craving.. I think everything is either a little too sweet or something is off.. The restaurant itself is really clean and cute though! The service can be a bit slow at times. I think the best thing I've tasted here is the pineapple fried rice. Everything is else is just mehh."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. Service was great and very quick. The pad thai was light and flavorful. We enjoyed the squid salad, too.  Very fresh! And the red curry had a nice medium-bodied flavor. We ordered spice level 6 but it was actually very mild. Fortunately they gave is extra chili sauce on the side :)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, NOT!  American styled Thai restaurant w appetizing food. I ate here because It has the most reviews of any Thai in Vegas and was highly recommended for lunch. Had Mongolian Beef which was enjoyable but not as spicy as ordered. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from here twice and eaten in once.  The food has been great every time - flavorful food and fast service.  Of course, you have to judge a Thai restaurant by its Pad Thai.  I had it and was not disappointed.  Dining in is a great option, but not optimal for a romantic dinner.  It would be good for a very casual night out.  The decor and the lighting is good, but it appears to be more of a family restaurant.  Tip: Get the Chicken Dumpling appetizer.  They are large, delicious and great to split between two people."}
{"text":"I went to Basil 'n Lime looking for an okay lunch. But what I received was very different than what i expected. They had lots to order off of their menu. I had a difficult time choosing between Lemon Sauce Chicken, Catfish Chili Sauce, and Pad Thai. My mom and I ended up ordering Catfish Chili Sauce and Spicy basil fried rice. I got a spicy number 3 on mine and my friend got a spicy number 2 on hers. I wouldn't recommend going any higher than a 4 if you can't handle too much hotness. The food was amazing, and they were very generous with their portion sizes. They put a lot of vegetables, chicken, beef, and pork in the fried rice. It was too much for the two of us split, so we had to get a to go box. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice, It was clean and the service was great. Our waiter was very nice, and checked in with us a lot. One thing I really enjoyed was the music they were playing, it was very soothing and relaxing. Overall I had a great meal, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in town! Their Tom Yum Koong is made to perfection and the portion is generous. We will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good, solid service, good food and BASIL 'N LIME DOES NOT DUMB DOWN THE SPICE SO BE WARNED!  I had a Thai iced tea which was earthy and tasty.  For the entree I ordered kang pahr.  I asked the server how it compared to a panang curry or red curry and all she said was \"It's hotter.\"  It had a clear broth for the curry with bamboo shoots, baby corn, eggplant, carrot, green bean and lime leaf.  I ordered it with chicken.  It also had plentiful dried hot peppers and Thai peppers (an interesting looking thing if ever there was one, see photos).  I enjoyed the kang pahr and having a hot (I ordered it hot but I wasn't brave enough to order it Thai hot after she said \"It's hot.\") curry dish without the coconut milk base was nice.  The chicken was good as were the veggies.  A couple of eggplant pieces had a slightly tough hide.  I liked the food and look forward to a return trip to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was in middle school and this has always been my favorite place to eat. The food is really good, I usually get paid Thai and crab Rangoon. Their prices are reasonable and I like ordering during lunch so I can't get their salad."}
{"text":"This was my second time having Thai food period (First place I went to was Thai Palace  BBQ on Jones and YUCK!), but the first time I'd visted Basil 'n Lime and I died and went to food heaven. OMG! This place had amazing food. I was starving when I got there so I went for whatever looked familiar to me: Crab Rangoos and Kung Pao Chicken. By far, this was the tastiest, freshest, most flavorful plate of Kung Pao I've ever eaten. My dads GF initially recommeded this restaurant to me a while back, but I just kept driving past it day by day on my way home not wanting to take her word for it. Big mistake! This is the place to be for yummy Asian cuisine, its piping hot when it comes to the table and tastes so very homemade. I got a level 3 spicy and that was not hot at all for me, so next time I'll up the ante for sure."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Thai take out.  They're friendly, food is fast and great tasting.  If you like papaya salad, Laos style is my fav and so flavorful.  Everything from your usual, Pad Thai or Spicy Basil Chicken, it's always good."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp panang curry today take out. When I got home 25 mins away. They gave me chicken panang so frustrated as I don't eat chicken. I called & she said bring it back. No thank you I don't feel like driving another 25 mins all the way back to exchange it. $12 wasted! Tip: Be sure to check your take out before you leave."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with my sister yesterday here! And I am stoaked I really loved it. I barely got into Thai and so I don't know a lot about it but that doesn't matter because our taste buds where in heaven, and that's all that matters.  The price was very reasonable. We came here around 4pm and it was dead, only one other person. I hope that this place gets business it deserves. The sign is so cute, I was just driving and looking for a place to go and quickly just turned in here.... the inside was nice and clean and decorated minimal but elegant. I am going to be going back here.  My sister ordered the green chicken curry and I got the the tom kai gow (chicken soup with lots of coconut flavoring, has mushrooms, lime juice and cilantro- the flavor is amazing!) I always order this soup when I go for thai food now...  I'll post pictures, looks really good...but in this case the food is better then it looks.  ;)"}
{"text":"Just ok. Not very clean. Food was good, but the place was empty, and I am OCD about cleanliness, especially where I eat. The place really needs a manager or owner who is detail oriented, especially with cleanliness."}
{"text":"They have a good selection on their lunch menu. I had a basil chicken, my niece had kung pao chicken, beef jerky for the appetizer w/ sticky rice, & Thai tea for drinks. Each plate was under $10, the portion was huge, we had leftovers. The food was flavorful, I just wish my basil chicken was spicy. I really enjoyed the beef jerky! The service was great, we got seated & order was taken right away."}
{"text":"Good place for on the go.  It's almost like a fast food thai place.  Cheap too."}
{"text":"Great new Thai restaurant on the west side.  Had dinner there this evening and the food was great.   Panang Curry was some of the best I have had here in Vegas.   The Pad Thai was also excellent.   Crab Rangoon was maybe a bit to crisp but still tasted great.  Can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"The yellow curry is great with lots of meat, potatoes and carrots. The spice was enough to clean out my sinuses, but that's how I like it. The coconut based soups are also worth trying."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when it first so opened. I think the food is pretty good for American Thai. The staff is very friendly and they also do takeout.   I love the pineapple fried rice and the tom young koong soup. I am sure I just spelled that wrong. The only downfall is they do not have alcohol. I love to have a nice Thai Beer with my food. I wish they would change this."}
{"text":"6/10/16 featured on dirty dining. Basil 'n Lime on South Fort Apache. The Thai restaurant's 40-demerit C grade was for continued non-compliance with Health District rules.Inspectors found lots of mold on zucchini and cucumber. There was also expired tomato sauce and curry ranging from two weeks to more than a month old.When Action News asked to speak to the person in charge, an employee gets on the phone to call the boss, then comes back to say, \"I don't know, he said he not want you to, like... show this or something.\"Inspectors found a big pot of curry on the floor. The restaurant also thought the floor -- which was dirty and pooled with standing water -- was a good place for eggs and woks.Food stored on a dirty floor is bad enough, but an employee's purse on the prep table is particularly disturbing since several studies show women's purses can be dirtier than toilets. There was also food stored at unsafe temperatures, uncovered food subject to contamination, or dirty conditions.  I ate there today 9/7/16 and they still have the C demerit displayed on the wall 3 months later. I pray I dont get sick."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with some girls from work. We got the Tom Ka soup, it was okay, not really alot of flavor. We all ordered lunch specials. My pad see ew was delicious and the portion was nice. The salad that comes with the lunch special was merely iceberg lettuce with some satay peanut sauce poured on it. The Thai iced tea was refreshing and not too strong. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because as friendly as our waitress was, she forgot to give us our check at the end of the meal. Then once we asked for it, she still took so long that we finally walked up to the order counter and asked for it there. In her defense she was the only waitress for the whole dining room."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, even after reading some of the negative reviews. After all, I've eaten at many street stalls in 3rd world countries!   We actually gave this place several tries and ordered different dishes. More than half were barely edible so yeah, pretty bad.   For instance, ordered a tomato based soup, and instead of tomatoes it was clearly ketchup based! I also ordered a classic Thai dish off their lunch menu, \"ground chicken with basil\". The portion was fair (although they only gave 1 small scoop of rice), but it was quite oily and the color was off, more of a turmeric color.  Anyhow, I did get sick from it (stomach cramps, etc.).   Bottom line, I won't be eating there again, and can't recommend this place. Plenty of decent and better Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I come here at least 3 times a month food is always so fresh and the staff remembers my order so that makes life even better. The lunch special is something you can't beat."}
{"text":"Meow was great , so friendly , excellent service I definitely come back because of her  Also food very good and  tasty  Her manager Tanya was so nice and professional. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We use this place if I don't feel like cooking.  We usually just stick to the chicken pad tai."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Everything always tastes so amazing and authentic, just the way my mom always made it for me! Best part is they have a lunch special everyday of the week!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch last week. Absolutely great. My husband ordered level 4 spicy,it was perfect. The ingredients are healthy,fresh and the place is very inviting. Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner!! Soup, papaya salad, & Penang curry... Mmmmm Basil n Lime is one of our go to spots. Seems like their swag is back. Everything tasted great and the service was on point. Great menu of flavorful items. I think I've tried almost all of them.  If you like Thai then definitely try this spot."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and staff was nice.  Bistro-type atmosphere with thai theme.  I ordered the yellow curry. It was a generous helping and very very good!"}
{"text":"DO NOT CALL FOR DELIVERY!  We have always LOVED this place but after two deliveries in a row being screwed up and disclosing a food allergy they ignored we are done.  We call and they tell us, \"thank you???\""}
{"text":"FIRST THAI PLACE IVE EVER TRIED AND ITS AMAZING!!! I get the shrimp Pad See Ew with Shrimp and it's so good. although I wish the shrimp tails were already off but it's okay. love this place"}
{"text":"The food is decent. Not happy that my Tom Kha Chicken doesn't have straw mushrooms. Beyond that, not happy that they automatically charge you 18% for service, over 6, they said, but IT's Not ok! We may have chosen to tip that or more, but to be force to tip 18% when the tip is supposed to be a response to how I feel about the service, is unacceptable. My family already was iffy about coming here and I brought them, not I regret it, as they left very unhappy. Unfortunately, they used to be better."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to dine in the restaurant yet but the 2 times i have gotten take out the food has been great.   The chicken pad thai is awesome. For some reason it tastes lighter, and fresher than any I have ever had.   The basil chicken lunch special w/ the optional fried egg on top is sooo good! YES, LIVE A LITTLE AND GET THAT FRIED EGG!  Spice level 5 is perfect w/ just enough kick it won't make you poop your pants!  Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Loved the tom yum....probably my 5th time and it's always good. Service  is really great here."}
{"text":"I had the pineapple fried rice, which comes with chicken and shrimp--more chicken than shrimp. It was good; the flavor wasn't the most sophisticated that I've had, but it was quite solid, and the serving size is generous--enough for two meals for me. Service was also friendly.  Their health code grade was an A; I double checked while I was in there."}
{"text":"A real quaint restaurant. We went in early for an early dinner. The restaurant has mainly tables or one sided booths and chair on the other side. We were immediately greeted and seated. The food was served really quick .. hot and tasty. We had the curry, pork basil and spicy eggplant. Portion size is reflective of the price. The waitress was attentive.  We will definitely come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Visited in Oct, 2009. Had the tom-kha-gai (coconut soup) and stir-fried vegetables. Very very tasty and authentic.  The meals are large and not over-spiced. I found my new favorite thai place in Vegas. (previously, Jasmine thai) . The prices are great too."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food I have ever eaten.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  The most amazing curry ever!"}
{"text":"Eaten here a bunch of times, and they never fail to serve great Thai food. I HIGHLY recommend the green curry, so good even the next day!!"}
{"text":"i've had some of the best thia food in the bay area and la. this was my first thai food in the lv area. the food was bland and the \"hot\" wasn't hot. i'll keep looking for a better spot in the meantime. the staff was really friendly and the prices aren't too bad. if i wasn't exposed to  good thai food this might have beeen a better experience."}
{"text":"This place is good but it used to be better.  I used to come here all the time but last time I was there, I don't know, it just felt like the flavor was kind bland and not popping like the way you expect Thai food to be.  I gave it 3 stars because I used to love the place and will give it another shot in the future."}
