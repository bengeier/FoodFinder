{"text":"Great in the spring and summer.  Even in fall and winter this place by the lake is fun. Fireplace, scrumptious seafood, heated patio, beautiful bar, live music Friday and Saturday ........and did I say scrumptious seafood?"}
{"text":"Crab cakes are nice - you can really taste the crab.   Kids meal portion is small for the $8.95 they charge. It doesn't come with any drink or dessert.   Overall pricey.  Service mediocre. Nice for the patio but would  try other places to eat next time."}
{"text":"Always loved this place for their seafood. Went there last Wednesday (late review I know)  and it was great. I ordered the Pecan Encrusted Salmon and it was delicious. Soft and full of favour, it was a change from typical Salmon. The wild rice was a great compliment as well. If I would recommend anything it would be to keep Rickards Ontap haha. But great experience as always. No pictures were taken as I was with a date and thought it may be rude."}
{"text":"Food is alright, I had a sandwich with fries. The service is ok but waiter seemed insincere. Probably the best thing about this restaurant is the view, which is quite spectacular. I might go back in the summer to experience the patio and try more of the menu, maybe it'll wow me."}
{"text":"Average food, pricy menu, long wait.  Get a good seat by the water or the docks or you'll regret the rest."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years. We live in the neighbourhood and although I wouldn't recommend one of the apps, the calamari (please focus on quality over quantity with this dish), it's still my favourite restaurant in Mississauga. You can't beat a Sunday afternoon sitting on the patio at Snug Harbour, and that's why if you want to get a seat, you've got to get there early. When we go, we'll spend hours sitting and enjoy the breeze off the lake. Such a beautiful restaurant and and we've made tonnes of great memories there."}
{"text":"Best patio in Mississauga. The remodeled d√©cor is lovely. Just find it hit or miss with the food. Tip: try the calamari!"}
{"text":"went here with the family for their half price entrees special.  The place is hugh, i bet during the day and in the summer time it's a gorgeous view.  Unfortunitly it was already dark when we got there but you could still see the water.  I had the mussels as a starter and they were good. i then ordered the lobster mac and cheese, which i found to be meh. it was very salty and the lobster, although a good amount, was hard to chew.  My mom had the ribs, which were fairly good seeing as this is a seafood place and were a good size portion with a side of roated vegtables. My dad had the fish (i don't remeber what kind) and my brother had the scallops and shrimps.  If it wasn't so far for me to get to (of course if you drive that's a differnt story) i would go again during the day when you can enjoy the view more"}
{"text":"My first time to visit. Very clean, wonderful 'fresh\" food, great band (Gene Hardy & Spark Jiver)"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a beautiful view but the food is overpriced.   I ordered Shrimp and Scallops ($23) as my main entree which came with 3 small roasted potatoes and vegetables. I usually can't finish my food when I eat out but after my dinner at Snug Harbour, I was still hungry...  I believe I got 4 shrimps and 4 scallops....  If it wasn't for the view, I would choose Red Lobster over Snug Harbour. Red Lobster gives you bigger portion and yummyyyy biscuits!   The service was okay. I went on Sunday night, it wasn't packed and it wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"The servers are all so well trained. Thank you for your service, Brit! I feel like I'm on holiday every time I come here , rain or shine. I love the calamari, great for everyone! If u like seafood . the cat fish is well done so are the mussels!  I see it like this ; if I'm up for a classy dinning experience I'd like to have great food and a spectacular view too!"}
{"text":"The actual location is what is so great about this place. It is right on the water so the ambience is quite lovely. It is especially nice in the summer on their patio. I got the lobster roll which was pretty good (not the best ive had) the service was good even though the place was fully packed."}
{"text":"Great crispy calamari and the stuffed white fish was to die for.  I will definitely go back and I definitely will recommend this restaurant to others"}
{"text":"Cute, low key place to relax & enjoy a platter near the water...live entertainment/sweet view/BYOB, perfect for long conversations. Overall, very enjoyable experience if your looking for something intimate and laid back with your girlfriends and don't feel like getting turnt...I would reccommend starting with wine & appetizers and definately dine outside to start the night. Food could have been delicious if they put in the effort.. i expected flavors to in my dish and color or atleast crispy skin on my fish~ I wouldn't come back unless the food improved."}
{"text":"If you want to impress family I'm friends without going downtown- this is the spot.  Order a round of oysters for the table ($3 a piece- way more expensive than oysters downtown but it's the ambiance and experience your paying for)  Try the Canadian whitefish stuffed with scallops/ shrimp and lobster. Drizzled with delicious sauces. The portions are quite small. And each dish is roughly $35   You should definetly check this out atleast once. If it's in your league you might become a regular.  I've found it to be more fun and a better experience to buy oysters from the fresh seafood market called dianas seafood.   But for a summer lunch dining my the lake is beautiful. Defiently a patio you want to be at.  Only 3 stars because the service is not always attentive. And for the quality and portion size of food. The portions have become much smaller.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the location and the lake views. The food was very pricey and the quality not so great. Our server did not come to check in on us. They don't reservations on Friday and Saturday evenings so that makes waiting for a table very long for a group of friends."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant located right on the water. It was my first time here and the food was very tasty. I had the mussels which came in a huge serving. The marinade was very flavorful and complimented the mussels well. I later had the fish and chips which was great. The batter had a buttery taste which is like nothing i've had before. I very much enjoyed it. I will definitely visit this restaurant again! The free parking in the back is a plus as well!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great atmosphere, right on the water with a great view of the boats in the marina. Very good service."}
{"text":"I've never had oysters and went to Snug to try them for the first time. The restaurant has a casual family vibe and is really nice next to the water.  My friend and I ordered 20 oysters, the mussels in marinera sauce, and fish and chips.  The oysters were so fresh and tasted awesome. The mussels and fish and chips were good too, but nothing overly crazy.  I would definitely go back for the oysters again!"}
{"text":"Lived in Mississauga my whole life but never visited until today. Something about eating by the Credit River that didn't appeal to me. Son suggested we try it as he had heard only good things. Celebrating his new job and he was footing the bill so who was I to protest? Got seated on the patio right away.  Almost a full house. View was fantastic. Excellent considering it was around 12:30pm and Victoria Day!  Started the meal with a perfect Bloody Caesar (Snug it up). Shared the fried calamari as an app. Big enough for the four of us and tender as can be.  Ordered the Seafood Pescatore as my main. Linguine in a lobster sauce with jumbo shrimp (4 of them) and huge scallops (2). Hot, fresh and plentiful. An excellent choice. Other choices around the table were the Seafood Ravioli's, Lake Trout, and the Seafood Pizza. Everyone was quite pleased with their selection. No room for desert but the Key Lime looked amazing at the next table. Service was top notch. $200 for four for lunch is a little pricey but its not somewhere you go everyday.  A little less expensive and I would have given it the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The lackluster food and high prices are countered by attentive staff and one of the best patios I've ever seen. You HAVE to come here once if only to sit out on the patio in nice weather. I would recommend maybe sticking to drinks and appetizers only and just relax and enjoy the waterfront."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 6pm and after about 20 min we got a spot on the patio overlooking the harbour. Beautiful view, excellent service and good food (was a bit concerned about food after reading some of the reviews on Yelp). The shrimp main w veggies was very savoury & got the thumbs up from both me and my toddler. Same with the beet salad. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great ambience, especially if you seat at the patio overlooking the lake. Very good (read fresh) seafood. The chef knows how not to overcook it and keeps it firm and tasty. Service is friendly and helpful - as it should be. Definitely a place to come again."}
{"text":"I love going here for the view!  We ordered calamari to start.  You get a large portion but they were a bit greasy.  I ordered the Seafood Pescattore and it was delicious and very filling.  The other dishes were good too Salmon Florentine and Seafood Ravioli. The Apple Taffy Cheesecake was fantastic.   UnfortunateIy, my sister got food poisoning from the Ravioli.  I called the restaurant to inform them and was surprised by the way it was addressed. I got a sorry and that's it.  I would of liked if the offer to reimburse her meal or something was offered but nothing.  I know her first experience wasn't good so she won't be returning.  Unfortunately I took her there on her birthday!  I'll go back because I've never had a problem in the last 3 years of going and enjoy the view and food!"}
{"text":"The food quality has improved in this restaurant! I was actually surprised to have such delicious calamaris at Snug Harbour! I'm definitely coming back! Loved the atmosphere too!!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was a bit on the slow side. If you have a free afternoon it is a great place for lunch and conversation with friends and family."}
{"text":"In my opinion the view was amazing .The atmosphere was very homogeneous. It was very un welcoming . We ordered the fish and chips plis the grilled salmon .they dishes lacked flavor and were bland .the fries and tartar sauce were the only things that tasted flavourfull .The price does not maych the quaulity of the food"}
{"text":"Seven members of my family and I went to Snug Harbour to celebrate an accomplishment.  I had called earlier in the day to make a reservation to avoid waiting too long.  The call was answered by someone who seemed to be laughing when they picked up the phone (very unprofessional).  I asked if we could make a reservation and they said that we did not need to as it was not busy.  I reminded the individual that we were 7 and they said no problem.  My family and I arrived at Snug Harbour to find it ridiculously busy and were given a beeper and told to wait.  Upon speaking to the bar manager, who did not seem sympathetic about our situation, another hostess suggested that they had room in the dining room and we could be seated right away.  Our waitress, Emily, was great and the food was well prepared and tasted good also.  However, my husband and I (we ate different meals) did not feel very well the next morning.  Thankfully, the hostess and our waitress were great and made up for person who answered my phone call and the manager who did not do anything to help the situation.  Not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place for oysters.....but the place is pricy. 3 dozen oysters, 2 appetisers and 4 drinks for a total of over $200.00.....you be the Judge."}
{"text":"I usually come to Snug Harbor when I'm craving pasta. When my boyfriend and I went, he got the Seafood pasta, while I got the Chicken pasta. My Chicken pasta was tasty, but the Seafood pasta is amazing...highly recommended!! I'm definitely getting that the next time I visit Snug Harbor. We also ordered the Clam Chowder as a starter, which was also delicious.   Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Our clam chowder apparently did not come out on time and before we even noticed, the waitress came forward to ask us if we received our clam chowder even though we never asked about it. After we responded, she immediately apologized and offered us the clam chowder on the house!! It was a totally unexpected treat for us.   I also know many friends who come to Snug Harbor for their oysters. The restaurant is dim lit and has an intimate atmosphere. In the Summer, their outdoor patio is great for enjoying the view/weather."}
{"text":"We've eaten here before but there's a new menu that is a big improvement since the last time. We tried the grouper sandwich and hamburger and both were outstanding. If not for the rather high prices ($14 for each item plus $3 extra for fries!), it would have earned a 5 star rating...but chalk up that extra cost to the gorgeous view and people watching and it works out to a nice meal all in all. We would go back again and order those two dishes all over again---they will even cook your hamburger medium rare!"}
{"text":"My sister hosted her birthday party here, for about 14 of us. We had drinks and appetizers, and a few of us ordered food. I ordered the Catfish Po Boy, and my friends had the Tortilla and the Salad with Bronzed Fish (Salmon?). We also had Calamari, Wings, Bruschetta, and some other stuff I didn't bother to try.  Calamari here is delicious, and the wings are pretty good too. I don't care much for bruschetta so I didn't have any. The Po Boy was okay, the fish had a bitter taste to it, but it also had some amazing sauce on the bread, which made it better. It's not as exciting as I thought it would be - just a grilled fish sandwich. I was hoping for balls of fried fish, but it turns out there are many variations. The tortilla overwhelmingly tasted of goat cheese, which is unfortunate because there were some grilled veggies and chicken in there, forgotten. The bronzed fish on the salad was terribly made (I thought this was a seafood restaurant?) - dry and tasteless. We all also noticed the salads were oddly bitter, and while the salad dressing was honey mustard, it still wasn't strong enough to balance out the flavours.  The drinks were good, according to the party. We brought a cake, and had to pay a $2 fee for every guest!! The nice thing is that they put every slice on a plate, with whipped cream on the side. Still, I was annoyed, especially since they don't let you bring your own wine either, so it ended up being a more expensive bill than I anticipated.   We got lucky with parking, but we were told others did not have such an easy time, the place was busy! I thought the place was well decorated, and had good atmosphere. I did find that the service was a little lacking, but like I said, it was unusually busy for a Wednesday night, perhaps it was a staffing issue. Our server was great and tried her best.   All in all, good but not great. Perhaps their dinner menu is better than the lighter fare. If I were to come back, I'd get a drink or two and the calamari."}
{"text":"This place is great, albeit a bit pricey!  You can always count on a selection of fresh fish, all-round good service, and a friendly atmosphere.  Go on a Saturday night for live music and a beautiful view of the setting sun over Lakeshore.    Staff seemed to be fairly knowledgeable in the dishes, although some of them seemed simply overwhelmed by the number of tables they were servicing.  As a result, service suffered somewhat on the busiest of nights, but by and large the experiences have been good.  Food wise - I'm not big on fish, but I like their fish.  It's tender and moist, and not \"fishy\" at all.  Their ribs are also pretty good for a place that doesn't specialize in it.  The open atmosphere is somewhat family-friendly, but I found myself less likely to order that glass of wine, unless I was seated outside.    Overall, just an enjoyable night in a quaint corner of 'sauga."}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this place for sometime. Went here on a Friday evening and the place was quite busy. Since we were a larger group, we had to wait a bit longer to get a table ( 45 mins).   The place is setup nicely and they also have a spacious patio overlooking the lake.   We ordered the Calamari for appetizer. It was nice and crispy but really nothing extraordinary. I've definitely had better at many other restaurants. For the main entr√©es, we ordered a variety of things including the stuffed whitefish, seafood pescatore, scallops entr√©e and the rainbow trout.   The stuffed whitefish as well as the scallops entr√©es , considering the price were quite little in quantity. The lobster cream sauce that came with the white fish was quite delicious and buttery. I think I liked the seafood pescatore pasta. Good taste, not too dry and with good amount of seafood.   Overall, I belive the place is nice but food is average. its definitely overpriced considering for quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I enjoy taking friends to this place because it has a good location. It's all about location. The summer is especially nice seated in the patio overlooking the lake. Food is very good.  If the service is slow--just enjoy the ambiance and the conversation with your friends and family.  Wines are very good."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant this week and had a fabulous time. It was moderately busy on a sunny Tuesday evening and we were able to get a table on the patio. Although it was really windy, the see-through blinds made it comfortable and we enjoyed watching the action on the river. We shared the mussels in white wine and herbs as a first course..really delicious. We both has the rainbow trout fillet (recommended by our waitress) and couldn't have enjoyed it more. I felt the prices were reasonable for the setting and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my favourite spots in Mississauga.  I've visited Snug Harbour several times throughout the years and I've never been disappointed. It's primarily a seafood restaurant, so if that's not your thing, there are plenty of other good options in Port Credit.   Some would point out that items on the menu might be a bit more on the expensive side (ex. Starter size bruschetta: $13, Caprese Salad: $14), but I would argue that with Snug Harbour, you're paying for the ambiance/environment as much as you are for the food.   And for me, that's just fine. Floor to ceiling windows facing the lake make for a great view with the sun is setting as you are enjoying your meal.   I've never had a problem with the service or the food here. Some favourites include the fish & chips and the oysters. They're also currently offering a $25 prix fixe menu with $6 glasses of wine from Mon-Thurs after 5.   Don't get to come out here as much as I'd like to, but any time I do, it's a great time!"}
{"text":"Great place with nice atmosphere. The price is fair as it is worthy, both the location and the food. My tuna martini and my friend's smoked salmon looks special but tasty. I also order a dessert which is delicious. Sitting on the patio with a great view of the harbour in such a sunny day, I know I want to come back again."}
{"text":"The first time here I had a nice time food was okay no complaints, second time our apps tasted off the calamari tasted burnt.  Third time I ordered tilapia and the whole bottom of my fish was burnt . Mixed feelings about this place the only thing really nice is the location."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice restaurant for our 1 year anniversary. After hearing the negative reviews I was skeptical as to the quality of service of this place. I knew that the restaurant had a good scenic view on the water and they would have a lot of options for non-beef or chicken items so I figure I take the risk and give this place a try. When me and my wife got there we realized it was a very busy place and it had was loud. Regardless of the noise, it was a very nice restaurant. Renata who was our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Some people said they waited upwards of 45 minutes for food. That was definitely not my experience. Our apetizerers came out within 10 munites of ordering them and the entr√©es came within 20 minutes of ordering. We ordered the seafood pescatore and the fish and chips. All the food was amazing. Now I realize with restaurants you can't believe all the negative stories and you just have to experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here.  The service is always excellent and we usually order their specials and we've never been dissapointed. We always sit at the front next to the fireplace and enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful meal! Definitely will be back especially to try their breakfast on the weekends. Great seafood!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointing. NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. Our recent visit on Mother's Day has totally put me off. I have to be honest and I hate to criticize but the service was very poor....I put it down it was Mother's day and they were busy but its still no excuse. After waiting for 1 hour we got the table outside in patio. But we realised it will be cold later in evening for 3 year old kid who was joining us too. We decided to move the table inside. As the place was getting busy we were told to be in queue and was given a pager. After about hour an half the lady manager came to us and told us you won't get the table as you are not our priority and the people standing outside is our priority. That didn't make sense as we had pager like the people standing outside. And we were not informed about this first.  At that point it felt like lady manager was discriminating as were only the brown/south Asian in the restaurant.  And on top of this Mr Roy Clifton who introduced himself owner of the restaurant didn't know how to handle the situation and told us to leave. Well obviously we were not going to sit in cold and take all the humiliation that we received from the Snug Harbour owner and the crew. On top of this ciaos  we didn't even mention to Mr Roy Clifton that cat fish ordered was stale and didn't taste good at all,  we also found human hair in one of the desert. At the end we paid more than $400.00 bill and walked out unhappy/disappointed."}
{"text":"Over rated for food, staff is so so as well. Good to go for drinks and enjoy the patio in the summer. Good people watching"}
{"text":"The best fish n chips in all of The GTA my my opinion. Huge fish fillets, even 1 piece is enough with fries. The atmosphere is great and the scenery and service are just as great. I will go again!"}
{"text":"Food here is hit and miss. The location is awesome. This time around I had the seafood ravioli which was probably the best meal I've had here to date. It was delicious. Service was good, and you can't beat the location."}
{"text":"We had a great meal tonight. Party of 3. Ordered 18 oysters, couple of glasses of white wine, a filet mignon dinner, tiger prawn dinner and pickerel dinner.   Everything was prepared perfectly. The waitress was really nice. The oysters were amazing. I think this is THE place in Mississauga to enjoy a calming lake view, a glass of wine and fresh oysters.   Took one star off because the sides were the same for all 3 entrees."}
{"text":"The food was so so but if you pay be credit card, remember to check your statement. Our waiter added $10 more to the total amount that I wrote on the slip.   I found that out when I received my credit card statement. I called the restaurant and talked to the manager and he stood by his staff. The credit card company credited my account. This is fraud."}
{"text":"I love going to Snug Harbour all year round. There's lots of seating inside and outside.  If you're going to sit outside and it's a bit chilly, don't worry.  They have outdoor heaters all around the deck!  The inside is more of a formal environment.  The restaurant has an impressive Oyster Bar Selections.  My friends had these to start and they said it was one of the freshest oysters they've had in Toronto.  Below are a dozen oysters, served with traditional seafood sauce and horseradish.    The Grilled Salmon was a good size and cooked perfectly.  It's served with rice and sauteed vegetables.  You can get potato of the day instead of the white rice if you wish.  They have plenty of other seafood selections such as Fish & Chips, Rainbow Trout, Scallops or even Catfish!  The Seafood Tagliatelle was light, fresh and very tasty.  The combination of Chorizo and the different shell fish was perfect.  I especially liked the addition of chili peppers - without it, it could have been a bit bland.  There was a good amount of clams, shrimp and mussels in there.  For dessert, we got two scoops of chocolate ice cream, served with some whipped cream and a slice of their Carrot Cake.  The Carrot Cake really impressed us.  The creamcheese wasn't overwhelming but it added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dessert.  We couldn't get enough of it!  Port Credit is such a nice area and Snug Harbour Restaurant gives us more of a reason to go often.  Their friendly & helpful staff, delicious food and the amazing view makes this place a great place to dine with your family, friends or for a romantic dinner date.  Make sure you go for a nice little walk after wards in the park!"}
{"text":"Went for after-work drinks with a couple of coworkers - beautiful ambiance inside but can fill up fast (we went in winter so no patio - but in summer the patio is jam packed). Excellent friendly service.  Had a large portion of calamari which was enough to fill up two people. Had the crab cakes (delicious) and the lobster mac and cheese (also delicious). Nice brownie and butter tart for dessert with a ton of ice-cream on the side. Truly enjoyed the meal!  The only problem with the place is that it is decently expensive - prepare the shell out some money. If you add drinks to it you can easily lose your shirt in there. But then again, it is so nice it's worth doing it every once in a while..."}
{"text":"In Mississauga, options for waterside drinks are somewhat limited. Snug Harbour has a fairly sizable outdoor patio that edges onto the water, and is a pretty sweet environment for a cool drink on a hot day.  I just wish they would change the radio station from that cloying generic country music...."}
{"text":"Monday night I went on a date, and my date surprised me with this place.   I had never been before but the weather was perfect for this sort of venue.  we walked down the path along the lake and came up to this restaurant.  The main door was awkwardly hidden. Which is a good thing for healthy people and a bad thing for the rest of the population. Myeh - it was a date. I had to be on my best behaviour. UGHhh.   The restaurant itself is rather nice, open windows all the way around, giving it a spacious feel. There's a nice patio out but looks a tad cramped.  We opted to sit inside right by the window  which was just as nice. By the time sunset hit, they had candles lit which really made the mood comfortable.  He had Stuffed Whitefish....................................................... 27.99 Fresh Canadian whitefish fillet, oven-baked with shrimp, scallops and crab meat in a lobster cream sauce.  came with a side of rice and veggies(mostly brocc and carrots). The rice was a wild rice with diced red peppers and really complimented the stuffed whitefish. This dish was rather good. I'm not big into seafood , but this was exceptionally good. The fish wasn't overtly dry or oily. It was just right. The flakes didn't fall off as much and the stuffing had the creamy sauce that went well with the veggies.  He also had the lime margarita - light and it comes in a small glass. All i tasted was the damned tequila. Not my thing.   I had the Penne with Roasted Chicken................................... 18.99 Virgin olive oil, crushed garlic, sun dried tomatoes, field mushrooms with a light Chardonnay cream sauce.  DELICIOUS!!. The cream wasn't as rich which really kills the whole pasta. The chicken breast slices were big, which was awesome!. The aroma of this plate was enough to make me lick the plate clean.But. I did not. I had to be on my best behaviour.   We had earl grey and the pecan carrot cake for desert. I normally love carrot cake so this was a different change (with the pecan) but for all the carrot/organic fruit cake lovers out there... this is the bomb diggidity. DO try it out! Unlike other places, they don't give you a big slice, which is nice if all you want is a bit of sweet after your dinner.   All in all, the bill was about $70. I would probably come back just for the stuffed whitefish and the calamari rings ^_^  xoxo M."}
{"text":"Oysters, raw, were ok.  Baked Brie was delicious, a bit greasy.  Calamari had a bit too much batter.  Wine selection was thin.  There was only one Riesling and was on the sweet side.  But the companion liked it.  It is a very reasonable everyday seafood restaurant.  I will certainly come again if someone chose it.  The lake view was gorgeous.  Clearly the best feature."}
{"text":"I went for brunch with a friend, and it was alright. It's a great location. Nice view of the water, and the Port Credit area. The service was satisfactory. Our waitress was polite, and helpful, but nothing special. Pretty much like the food.   It was very bland, boring, and over priced, which pretty much describes Mississauga. The potatoes were probably the least bland. In fact, I think they were over seasoned with whatever spice they put on it. I love spicy food, but this was just a little too much, given the fact that this brunch of egg and salmon was pretty tasteless.   They plated the food really weirdly too. There was yogurt and fruit on the plate, that was getting touched by the potatoes. So the spices got on the yogurt, and it was not a pleasant mix of flavours.   The tea was alright. It's Higgins & Burke, nothing special. (I'm waiting to find a place in the Toronto area that serves Dammann Fr√®res).  The atmosphere is nice. Mostly suburban families.  I heard this place used to be great, but now it's just alright."}
{"text":"Location is a big plus, with the lighthouse just outside, the stream flowing beside, its one of the best spots to eat in the summer. The food is good to so no letdowns! I had italian and was just what I needed."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere.  Price is exaggerated for their food and setting.  Taste is nothing better than your local Kelsey but you are paying The Keg price.  Service is moderate.  Summer patio is nice minus the mosquitoes since it is by the lake."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Mississauga. It was closed down for renovations a few months ago, but has just re-opened, I'm told. The only thing I ever eat there is the Penne with Roasted Chicken. Been eating that for years. Ain't gonna stop. That chicken tastes like nothing else. Maybe it's due to the fact that it's roasted? I don't know, really. \"Roasted chicken\" doesn't really sound that complicated and/or delicious, but boy oh boy, it is. Oooo, and that sauce? MAN. When I heard that they were changing up their menu, in fear, I emailed the owner to see if my pasta would make the cut. It did. Only now with fusilli instead of penne. I don't want to express the relief I felt in that moment. It was only slightly pathetic.  Anywho, if you live anywhere near Mississauga, you should probably go if you haven't already. It's on lakeshore and it's busy as hell in the summer (for good reason). Just amazing food. You can take a look at their new menu(http://www.snugharbourrestaurant.com/starters.php), if you like.  GO!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday mid morning looking forward to their amazing brunch menu! Unfortunate to say they only offer it during the winter months!   Low and behold me and my girlfriends were hungry so we decided to have regular lunch, and we definitely weren't disappointed.  We had: Calamari Fish n chips Toasted Brie Mussels Crab cakes  Favourite was definitely the toasted Brie! Totally on point.  The portions were very large, we ended up over ordering more than we could eat. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. The fish n chips especially were well battered and flaky to touch.   The service here was attentive and helpful. From beginning to end we felt the welcome and warm attitude that each server had.   The ambience is great! We sat on the patio situated on the lake, on a clear day you can see the lovely view of the lakes.  Definitely a go to if you're looking for a nice patio to hang at!   Another solid restaurant to add to port credits great collection!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Decent menu. (Steaks, seafood, chicken & ribs mostly). Very good food. A little pricey.  It started to get busy and the music started to get loud.  We would return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the company I was there with, but the food not so much.   I think the views and location are added into the price of their food. It's a great place to bring guests, but maybe just for drinks."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this restaurant is very nice. We got a patio table it was a cold day but the heater system allowed us to sit there :)   For appetizer we ordered calamari which was very nice and not to oily. I ordered the black tiger shrimp it was very nice but with the roasted potatoes I was a bit disappointed no flavor .  The shrimp was in a garlic kind of sauce marinated which was absolutely delicious.  The veggies on the side tasted just ok nothing special and flavorless. After that we had dessert we ordered chocolate brownies and chocolate lava cake. The chocolate brownie cake came with vanilla ice cream which was very good and the  Chocolate lava cake I think was the grand finale of that evening it was sooooo good.  So I think I would most likely go back and have dessert there. The place is very family friendly. But I would suggest if you go there with kids or babies sit outside in the patio cause inside the music and sometimes the live band can be very loud ."}
{"text":"When Tia told me that I was being taken to a restaurant not only outside of Yorkville, but a seafood restaurant even more West than Bloor West Village, I panicked. I just didn't wanna go..I need to be in my comfort zone, which was Yorkville!  Parking was remarkably easy to find, and all the landmark I ever needed was this lighthouse by the road. The neighbourhood was bloody gorgeous, and I think I heard sounds from Toronto's only drive-in cinema nearby.   Snug could not have been more interestingly located, I'm sure it was the property of some yacht club. The walk from the street to the restaurant was interesting, and scenic. We had reservations, but as it goes, we ended up waiting five minutes for some reason. I waited by the bar area and ordered a pint of something on tap. The bar was big enough, bigger than most restaurant on Danforth. That is what I have to say about this place if I were to sum it up in one word. Big. The d√©cor was basically like any typical seafood restaurant, it simulated the interior of a boat. There were patio seating by the lake, that was very intriguing. The waitresses were friendly, I almost got the feeling I was up at Muskoka or something.  I got the whitefish, bloody delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked, and had a buttery texture. The portion was actually generous enough to satisfy me...in a SEAFOOD RESTAURANT! What do you know about that! The price of that dish couldn't even get you ten shrimps at a place like Thai Express.   I got a glass of the Chardonnay, I forgot which, I just remember it being all swell.  The crowd here on a Saturday night was also..interesting. You got your typical Abercrombie white boys with their Barbie dolls, seniors who lived the area, and snobs like me. It was a nice mixture, as we all were able to sit quietly and enjoy the live Jazz. A couple felt like dancing, more joined when \"What a Wonderful Life\" came on.  Sometimes I have my doubts about my dear friend Tia, but she's never let me down yet. If this were a romantic date..I would have definitely put out. Let that be a hint for you guys out there!"}
{"text":"I had a belated birthday meal here, and chose the seafood bouillabaisse. I was blown away by it's proportions, but also the amount of seafood present inside. I absolutely love the tomato broth, complete with a ton of veggies and shrimp, salmon (or trout?), mussels, cuttlefish, etc. A little on the pricey side, but I was being treated so I obviously didn't mind!  My sister got the seafood ravioli and it was quite flavorful too! It was rich in cheese and you could distinctly taste the crab bits. However, she found the taste a little too overpowering, resulting in the seafood flavour being muted/covered."}
{"text":"I live 10 minutes away from this restaurant, yet have only discovered it recently. Mississauga has a a fairly small list of unique restaurants or places that are really enjoyable (I, of course, am excluding franchises and chain-restos, i.e The Keg, Ruth's Chris, Moxie's, Baton Rouge, etc. as these you can find anywhere.), but I find Lake Shore Mississauga has some fun ones I'm looking forward to trying.  Snug Harbour was a recommendation from Ryann O. as I had been going on an Oyster binge that week, and was craving them daily. I didn't know of any oyster bars in Mississauga. He recommended this one.  The oysters that day were SO good and definitely satisfied my craving. They only had one kind though. I forgot the name. Started with an \"M....\". Regardless, they were yummy, medium bodied. Alongside, they offered lemon (as many as requested) and home-made seafood sauce. Meh. Not too happy with the sauce. It was clumpy.  Luckily for us, entres that week were half-priced being that it was Winterlicious season! I got the lobster tail dinner, my friend got salmon, and another got lobster mac-and-cheese.  The lobster tail was decent. Steamed, offered with butter, nothing too special. I enjoyed the side veggies though. LOVE the sauteed zucchini's. My friend's salmon was delish too. It was cooked in some sort of soy sauce glaze. Very tender and flavourful. The rice was good. Nothing special about the way it's cooked, but I have low standards when it comes to rice in seafood/non-Asian establishments anyway. The lobster mac was yummy as well. Huge portion. Definite doggy-bag.  Another time I had the garlic-butter shrimp and scallop. PASS! This dish was horrible. Lacked flavour, shrimps and scallops were overcooked. Bf had steak sammie. This was okay. Steak was a little dry.  For a sauga resto, this place isn't half bad. Id come again for the oysters and the mac, but that's probably it. If they upgraded their sides, I think I'd give it a 4.  It was the wintertime so I couldnt see too much of the lake or dock outside. From what I did see, it looked small and nothing to boast  about. lol. But the summertime is probably different."}
{"text":"Arrived at 1pm for a late lunch, and outdoor tables were a 30 minute wait. Noooo!  Service was quick for the most part, plenty of staff, and attentive.   We had the 2pc fish & chips, mussels in marinara, and the smoked salmon pizza.  The pieces of battered fish was HUMUNGUOUS. They gave a one piece option (2pc was only $3 more) but unfortunately we were ordering with our greedy eyes and not our stomachs.  The pot of mussels were super filling itself already, but so so good.  I couldn't help ordering the pizza; smoked salmon anything is good for me! The pizza came almost completely covered with salmon & artichokes. Mmmm mmmm. Only downside, the bottom of the pizza was slightly soggy.   Great experience overall! Would definitely come back. Next time if I get pizza, I'd get it well done."}
{"text":"After being closed for 14 weeks snug harbour in port credit reopened their doors to the public a week ago Monday.   Among the changes to the menu, restaurant, kitchen, wine list, and website they also boast an impressive and gorgeous new bar with plenty of flat screen televisions. The entire place screams elegance and even the seating in the main dining area is in comfortable leather wrap around chairs. The water side/heated patio is sitting there at the moment unused, teasing me to comeback once warmer temperatures prevail.   Their revamped and rebranded menu is filled with new surprises including a Friday night prime rib special! What hasn't changed is the incredible location on the water. Simply amazing to sit in the bar area and watch as the Credit river flows into Lake Ontario.   ** fellas this is a prime time date spot - please note **  While the staff was friendly my server Aimee was remarkable and super helpful making stellar menu recommendations. Through her advice I had a fantastic meal which included:  Six of their market fresh oysters to star; 3 of the raspberry point and 3 of the summer side. Which were $3 and $2.75 each respectively.   For my Main course ($14) I stepped out of my comfort zone and devoured a Catfish po-boy sandwich - a light and crispy catfish filet, breaded and tender like butter. Served on a kaiser with a magical spicy mayo (made with mayo, cayenne, and other yummy additions), pickles, tomatoes and lettuce. NOM-my-god!!!!  The po-boy was accompanied by Caesar salad for a side but it could have stood alone as a main course. You could tell the dressing was made fresh to order as I could pick up a hint of tobasco sauce. This is always a sign of a fresh dressing coming from a steak house service background and making table side Caesars 5-6 times a night!   Overall an amazing experience! Congratulations Snug on your reopening you've done a marvellous job. I'm full, happy and anxious to return.   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful lake view patio. great food. I love the live band nights throughout the summer. try the blacken cajun catfish, its absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Fabulous from start to finish. We had oysters to share and they were very good. My husband had clam chowder that was packed full of clams and he had seafood ravioli that he loved.  I had lobster which was really amazing. We ate every last bite on our plates and would return again!! We highly recommend this place and the view of the water was very pretty even in the fall. I bet the summer experience is even better."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times over the years. To be honest, tore mainly paying for the views and location on the water rather than the actual quality of the food. It is over priced and the food is average, but if you're coming here, it's mainly for the location than anything else."}
{"text":"Went to snug harbour for a 7 pm reservation and were told we had a hour wait. Asked to speak to the manager and he rudely told us if don't like it to leave.!!!  Had oysters that were off.  Drinks never came. Needless to say we would never go back.  Btw. Watched the hostess taking tips which bumped us down the list.  Very expensive fish and chips. !!!!"}
{"text":"We were here this evening to celebrate a birthday.  The restaurant only accepts reservations for parties 10+, so if you are with a small party, you are SOL.  We arrived at 5:30pm and told it was an hour wait. We were seated at 6:45pm only after I told the hostess my mum was diabetic and if you say an hour, you have to mean an hour. We were promptly seated at a table that had remained vacant the entire time we had been waiting...   For this reason, we will never be coming back to Snug Harbour. And I advise people to try another venue for your party in Port Credit. These guys have some work to do.  The food and servers were top - notch. Too bad. This place is just so disappointing."}
{"text":"Great patio for waterside dining. Food was good, drinks were great. Service felt a little rushed. This is a nice spot to boat over to and enjoy some time outside on their patio. The menu is large enough that all tastes should be easily satisfied."}
{"text":"Great location and that's about it.  Menu: Not a lot of choices.  Service: Extremely slow.  Waitress: Clueless  Would come here again for drinks and the patio."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful view of the harbour but do not come here to eat. It is overpriced and mediocre pub food at best.  staff are friendly and helpful and do their best with the poor menu. Have a drink on the deck with some fries, cut your losses and leave."}
{"text":"Beautiful location for a meal and a walk along the boardwalk. Aa a party of 7 we were seated quickly. Even allowed to choose the table we wanted in a busy evening. The kids servings are huge. The \"mohito\" is a great cocktail. The blackened trout was a large portion but ver good. The Mediterranean salad was huge and fresh. The tiger shrimp was also good. We were too full for a dessert. Snug Harbour sits on Lake Ontario so we were entertained by the fishing boats, rowing teams and paddle boards that were right outside the window. The boardwalk makes for a pleasant after dinner stroll. After your stroll there are some fun businesses to check out in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Parking was an issue but besides that everything was great. Food was great (except that dijon-sumtin' chicken I had. No clue what that supposed to be). Staff was very friendly. I'd definitely go back there for a nice summer dinner at the waterfront."}
{"text":"We sat right beside the window we had a lovely view of the lake. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the staff was friendly. Most importantly the food was absolutely amazing, we had crabcakes and pasta in Seafood sauce with shrimp and the largest scallops on earth!  The crabcakes were tender and crispy with a spicy coconut Thai sauce. Pasta was cooked to perfection with a creamy seafood sauce and came with jumbo shrimps and scallops which were also cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend this place, unique experience and good food."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I came here for dinner and the menu was very limited for someone who is both gluten and dairy free.  The Breakdown: Food: Not so great; Not allergy friendly Service:  Excellent  Ambiance:  Nice  We started our meal with some oysters, which tasted delicious!  I have to give them credit for having yummy oysters but they only had two varieties to choose from. We ordered both to try and I really liked the Raspberry Points oysters, which were much more sweet and creamy than the French Kiss oysters. However, my friend preferred the French Kiss oysters.   The menu had what looked like an amazing swordfish dish but the waitress told me the chef would not be able to make it dairy free. At other restaurants, they would be more than willing to customize the dish to my dietary restrictions. I was kind of surprised by this attitude and slightly disappointed.   I ended up ordering the rainbow trout plain with no seasoning since it was the only thing the waitress recommended for my diet. I found the fish creamy but it was really bland. I slathered lemon juice all over it but it still didn't have a lot of flavour. My meal also came with vegetables, which were supposed to be steamed but they were very flavourful and my friend said they tasted like they had butter on them as his were supposed to be steamed as well. Let's just say, he was probably right because shortly after I ate my meal, I began to have terrible stomach cramps and other issues associated with lactose intolerance.  My meal also came with mini potatoes. I have to say, the potatoes were the most flavourful thing on my entire plate. They tasted delicious!  I was very happy with the service. Our waitress did an amazing job at refilling our water and checking in on us. The view of the harbour was also really nice and I enjoyed the live entertainment.   With that being said, I would probably not return to this restaurant. Diana's oyster house does a much better job at preparing yummy seafood and they have a much more extensive oyster menu with lots of variety to choose from."}
{"text":"I often stop at this pub when I'm cycling along the waterfront trail. Once you get into Port Credit, you pretty much run right into it. They have a very large waterfront patio with views of the local marina, and out towards the lake, which makes Snug Harbour a great a place to stop by in the summer. Most of the menu is seafood, and there are quite a few choices. Overall the food quality is average, I've never had anything that really stands out here and for the price, it should. The prices are on the high end, expect to pay $18-30 for a main. Snug Harbour is not a bad place to enjoy the views, but you can find better food on Lakeshore Road."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because the food is just ok. I mean, don't get me wrong....it's not bad, it's wholesome filling food, with some gems like the calamari and the seafood bouillabaisse but overall, it's decent.  What you go here for is the ambiance. The waitstaff is quick and helpful, there's a live band on the weekends, the place is always hopping and the view....that's what you go for. It is one of the very few places in all of the GTA to have a waterfront wraparound porch that you can sit on for hours and just enjoy the lake breeze with your friends and family. In the winters, they pull down the transparent canvas and put out the space heaters so you can enjoy the porch year round. And we are lucky to have it in our backyard! It's always busy in the evenings, so put your name down and go for a stroll around the area....Port Credit Lakeshore has some cute stores and just a walk around the lakefront will help you work up an appetite for Snug Harbour."}
{"text":"Came to have a belated bday lunch with my brother and his gf today.  It's such a nice place by the lake in Port Credit.  First off, it's nice to have free parking when you go anywhere, so free parking to eat here is a plus.    Food...everything we got was pretty good.  I think the best thing we got out of all of our meals was my brother's gf's choice of the seafood ravioli.  The sauce had great flavour and you can taste the seafood in it.  Our apps were crab cakes, calamari and oyster.  I got the fish tortilla, brother got fish and chips and my daughter got chicken fingers and fries.  Fries were good, thick cut and crispy!   Atmosphere...very open and lots of windows to get the nice views of the water.  They have open/enclosed patio seating with heaters.  Very elegant and classy looking dining area and bar with a nice glass wine shelf wall by the entrance.  Service...our server was the utmost pleasant person.  Very friendly and attended us time to time.  I wish I remembered her name...bad habit of mine.  I'd definitely come back again, possibly at night time to see how different it looks or day time...whatever lol it's a cute spot by the waters and you can soak in the view."}
{"text":"Pricey but definitely worth a try. Great food and beautiful view of the harbour. Summer nights here are great because the patio is heated. Its always jammed pack though, and they dont take reservations between Fri-Sun. I cant complain though, I've had great experiences here."}
{"text":"Good food, beautiful view of the lake. My friend anf I both had scallops and they were nicely done. Appetizers were delicious."}
{"text":"Really, being by the water this place is not bad for the price you pay! Took my gf here for her birthday and it definitely did not disappoint. Perfect date night romance wine and dine type of place. Make sure you come here and get seated on the patio and watch the sunset! Finding parking here was a struggle though, just an FYI.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Price: 4/5 Presentation: 3/5 Taste: 3/5 Portion: 4/5 Service: 4/5  Atmosphere: Loved the atmosphere here. They had a live jazz band playing which was really nice and relaxing. We got seated outside as we requested for the best seats in the house =). Didnt get to enjoy the jazz music but definately got to soak in some habour viewing. It was too bad we came here when it was dark already. This would make such a lovely view if it were during sunset timing.   Price: The price is actually not too bad. Same as what you would pay at the larger franchises like Keg etc. My friend and I ate a bit before coming here so we only ordered a starter and a main to share. The price was around $60 tax and tip included.   Presentation: Their presentation is nothing out of the ordinary, so I have nothing to highlight here.  Taste: Taste was a bit of a hit and miss. The crab cake we order was absolutely scrumptious! The seafood pot was alright...it needed a bit more flavour it seems.  Portion: Portions are about average I would say. The server gave us some good recommendations on what to order based on our appetite.   Service: Was greeted right away upon arrival. Asked for the best seat in the house and they quickly sat us on the patio by the water. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable but they don't really come around often if you are sitting outside on the patio so that was a downer a bit on service time."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years..it's because of their amazing calamari that I keep coming back for..A must for any seafood fan. I ordered the Seafood Ravioli and it was delicious. The portions look tiny but if you eat slow like I do, they'll fill you right up. I couldn't even finish mine.."}
{"text":"It's been more than 2 months and I'm still craving for some more mac and cheese...  I had the Lobster Macaroni, which consisted of aged cheddar, lobster, and roasted tomatoes. The lobster was barely there but I did like the tomatoes to counter the heavy pasta. Besides that, I would say that it was a near perfect dish.   Given that I've only visited this establishment once, I cannot give a perfect rating (yet...). Plus, I haven't tried their seafood dishes, of which I believe they are known for. On another note, my friend did say that their Pecan Encrusted Salmon was something worth ordering again.   As for dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake. I also ended up directing the image of the plating to Gordon Ramsay because it was rather..disappointing. It didn't taste too good either so I'd stick to ordering mains if I were to return.  Pros: The view! Loved the open concept and how the sun was shining in!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this place. A real Snug and it's super baby friendly. The food is very good; you're paying for what you get. Good selection of drinks and amazing dessert."}
{"text":"We came here sometime in July 2011 on a Friday night. There were a lot of people and by the time we left, there was a line. We ordered a stuffed crab for appetizer. It was okay. Nothing special. I ordered a fish dish which I can't believe I can't remember right now. It wasn't anything special maybe that's why I couldn't remember it. My husband had steak and lobster. For the price, it was not worth it at all. The lobster was somewhat overcooked.   The place is nice though because it is by the water. Still, I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday with some of the family.  Love this place for being right by the water, and love it for people watching.  Such a diverse mix of people walking by all day.  Then you have the boaters who come in from Hamilton or elsewhere and make a day of it in Port Credit.  As for the food, well the shrimp kebab was alright, and so was the white wine mussels.  The scallops came in a creamy, cheesy sauce that was kind of addictive.  However the rice was overdone and not al dente.  The food kind of reminded me of the Keg plus Red Lobster.  Just go here during the day, grab a beer, relax and take in the view."}
{"text":"If you can find a spot on the patio on a warm summer day - SCORE!   Seafood restaurants can be a hit or miss, and really depends on your preference. As an occasional consumer of seafood, it was a good spot to try something fresh. Unfortunately I wasn't too hungry. We shared a plate of fried Calamari, and I had the crab cakes as my main. The fried calamari wasn't anything special, and resembled most other pub appetiser menu. The dip was probably the only thing that stood out, and added a nice touch. The crab cakes were good, and the curry sauce on the side make it well balanced. It was different, but good.   4 stars may be a bit generous, given the prices feel a tad overcooked and the food is fairly generic. It's a good spot for business lunch, especially on a nice summer day."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I loved it both times! I got the whitefish and it was so delicious! And our server was on so delightful, made sure we were taken care of! =) definitely highly recommended! We ate on the patio but inside they have live music which I thought was very enjoyable, the energy was all  good vibes."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and all were very good experiences. The food and the service ratings from me are high in their own categories. The Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness is commendable.  The food, though the portions are a little small for the price you pay, is nothing less than amazing. My family usually ordered the dishes and nibbled on every dish. Wirth the visit. Seafood should be a must in your order.  The servers were quite attentive during each visit. A remarkable feat considering how busy it can get at times. Always with a smile.  The Restaurant is well kept at any given time. It is a must for me. Nice atmosphere and meant for large groups. Brings out the best in the social aspect of the dinner.  Of course, the lake is the icing on the cake. It adds to the entire experience. Dinner snd stroll down the harbour, well makes me look forward to visiting again during summer."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in the summer. Cute location. Service was slow but why be in a rush when you're by the lake. Food good and maybe a tad overpriced for the portion size but it's the same way at all waterfront restaurants. I look forward to returning again and again."}
{"text":"Just came here yesterday on one of the first nice patio days of the year. Was impressed that the inside of the restaurant was almost as inviting as the patio.  Was also impressed that the value / pricing was much better than it could've been for such a great location literally right on the water.   We just had drinks and an app but the service was very professional and everything was quite good. Local beer and two types of Sangria with baked brie is my perfect idea of a spring patio day!   Will hopefully be back soon to try a full meal; especially with their good selection of seafood dishes which I love!"}
{"text":"Caveat: This review is more about the real estate than the food.  If you're at Port Credit and want to relax at a patio, then there's no competition, Snug Harbour is the place to be!!  They have a wrap around patio with amazing views.  Facing Lakeshore, you will have a great view of the parked boats, on the side, a great view of the canal and depending where you are facing, you can be looking at the bridge and the lighthouse or the impressive lake. On the back end of the restaurant, an amazing view of the lake.  You will see boats drive by the canal and the ambiance it creates is just so relaxing.  You will catch a great breeze and definitely enjoy the relaxation time, if you're not hungry or looking for great food.  The service is wonky and the food is below average.  You won't feel relaxed if you're there to eat because you will be waiting on blah food from service that is not good.    You really just go here for the real estate.  If you want a great view of the lake,"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this review is based on three bites of calamari and dessert.   I came in here already pretty full with a group of friends, so I didn't order anything but dessert. I tried the calamari, it was nothing special and not worth the price. I ordered dessert (the key lime pie) and let me tell you, they should not call this a pie. It was more of a gelatinous cheesecake-y type of dessert. No lime curd, nothing. Just this gelatinous things that did not taste good. Even the whipped cream that was on top didn't taste good, how is that possible?!  The prices are really expensive and from what I gather from my dining companions, the food wasn't mind blowing. My guess is you're really paying for the location and the view...  The place gets really loud once it's busy too. We were having a hard time hearing each other.  Overall, I'm glad I came in already full. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs, rude and horrible service food is mediocre at best, and it takes one hour to get to your table, and if you complain they pretty much tell you to shut up, avoid this place at all costs, do yourself a favour and drop by McDonald's or something at least you'll still had your dignity."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for my moms birthday and it was an absolutely fantastic experience! We stopped in for a later lunch and even though the restaurant was super busy we were seated immediately.   Situated on a bank of an inlet to the lake, this restaurant offers gorgeous views while you dine. The decor inside is very modern and clean and the staff are friendly.  I had a chicken Dijonaise which was breaded and came in a mushroom white wine sauce with vegetables and a choice of either potatoes of the day or rice. It was deliciously cooked and I would definitely recommend. Everyone else in our party were equally impressed with their choices.   For desert I had the key lime pie which was more of a mouse come cheesecake but still very good. I'd try something different next time though.  Overall we had a great experience, the only negatives really being the noise inside when the restaurant was busy (the acoustics aren't the best). Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of history tied to this place, for over 16 years, and unfortunately it has been in a steady decline. Yes, there are still a few \"lifer\" servers, and yes, the location is amazing.  The food though, is where the trouble is - it is mediocre, and they keep raising their prices, year in and year out. After the place got renovated, a few years ago, it seems like profit is the main driver, rather than the quality of what is being served.  I've decided to entertain myself, and actually try meat, instead of seafood, on my most recent visit - what a mistake. A burger at A&W tastes quite similar to what I've had - it just doesn't cost nearly $20.  As much as I'm loathe to admit it, I will come back, because Port Credit is a lovely area, and this restaurant is situated in just the perfect spot."}
{"text":"Good fresh sea food at not so bad prices. Food seemed fresh not frozen and staff friendly. Not to mention it's right by the water so great view outside. They also have non sea food if you prefer chicken or some other menu item. Plus they are open late. The fish hit the spot. I'd definitely revisit."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. Great ambiance, really pretty patio on the water and food is super good and fresh. My favourite go-to is the fried fish sandwich. So moist and well seasoned and the side salad is so simple but compliments the sandwich really well. The jerked shrimp is a great appie, amazing flavour and the Seafood trio is great to share or have as a light meal. The chowder is on point and rich enough but not to the point of being too overly creamy. A great choice for date night or catching up with friends, esp in the summer!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is better than the food, but still worth it if you're hanging out in Port Credit!  Summer is better as the river  is not frozen over...lake view is good winter or summer."}
{"text":"Went here with friends had a walk on the boardwalk and then had dinner here..  Amazing food..  Baked brie was amazing and so was the stuffed white fish..  Very nice scenery to go with the great ambience and food.."}
{"text":"Most promising location in the area , if u like water front this is the place , beautiful patio space with good seafood options. If u don't like sea food no point coming here at all . We went for lunch and there was a wait of 25 minutes . Huge place over 100 covers . We were made to sit by the waitress n offered menu . Menu not complicated but very expensive . We ordered pilsner beer with a stack of Oysters and later jumped to fish n chips . Oysters were nice but $3 per oyster is killing , ended up eating 15 oysters ( 2 of us ) . Beer was perfectly chilled n served . Loved sitting at the waterfront patio with powerboats passing by. Good for weekend relaxing lunch !!"}
{"text":"Went here with a part of 5. Ordered oysters, calamari, shrimp and bruschetta for appetizers. Everything was ok nothing was great. Oysters were tiny and calamari was greasy.   For mains we had ribs, fish tacos, salmon, steak and cod. Nobody seemed to enjoy their dinners at all except for me who orders the tacos! Mine were pretty tasty!   The wait staff seem untrained or lazy. We rarely had service and we were always constantly waiting on water. At one point I walked to their counter area picked up a pitcher and brought it to our table. It was really busy but there was also about 5 waiters in our area which only had about 7 tables!   The prices are very expensive I my opinion. We ended up paying roughly $100 per person and other than the beautiful view of the harbour, this place is overrated. I would not return"}
{"text":"Always seen this place right on the lake in Port Credit and finally went there in June 2018.  They take a limited amount of reservations for a Friday and had run all out when I called.  So our family decided to walk-in at 5:30 (a little early) and requested a patio which is a must as the views are great.  We waited 30 minutes and got a seat right along the lake.  There was nice breeze and ample sunshine.  Tip - bring a hat as the sun can beam down on the patio.  The wait staff were very pleasant and not rushing us which made for a relaxing meal.  We noted that it got busier around 6:30 - so come before that time if you don't have a reservation. Items that were ordered: Lobster Mac & Cheese, Fish & Chips, Jack Daniel's Burger, Salmon and Blackened Catfish.  Everyone raved about their dishes.  All were done to perfection.  Dishes came with choice of potatoes and a selection of vegetables.  We were so full from the main dishes that we skipped dessert.  The food and the views made for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Very classy place, I like the view and the service. Despite my order was very good (jack Daniels burger, very recommended). My friends weren't very impressed with shrimps. The tiple plate starter was good too."}
{"text":"For someone who's not even a seafood fan I guess a 4-star rating says a lot about this place. I decided to treat my wife with a seafood dinner since it's never my first choice and she never gets a chance to have it.  We had the freshest oysters she ever had, followed by Smoked Salmon with Salad, deep fried Calamari, lobster mac&cheese and key lime pie for dessert, all appetizers washed down with a reasonably priced Australian Chardonnay.  There was a 1.5hour waiting list for a patio table (it turned out to being 45min) and our server Aimee was fantastic. We're definitely going back (we live on the east end, but I still believe it's worth the hike)."}
{"text":"We were here twice in 13 hours for lunch and dinner!! Fabulous fish and chips! Terrific grilled salmon especially on the market green salad. Yummy light dressing. Had a great Bloody Mary too! And service was impeccable. Thank you Cassidy!!"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times... the last time I went I didn't even realize it was Snug Harbour... lol (strange) Anyways, The food is alright... definitely nothing special. I got the calamari once... and it was way too greasy and bit disappointing since this is a seafood joint... The atmosphere is nice (if you're sitting outside). Another downside... in the summer the waitresses wear shorts... and nothing against them but some of them shouldn't be... lol"}
{"text":"Beautiful View makes this the BOMB patio area.  Came here by accident really, when one of my friends slept in and we missed our tee time for golf. Instead of golfing we went around the Mississauga area looking for Seafood. Where do you find seafood? By the water! So we drove along Lakeshore and as we approached the Lighthouse at Port Credit, I totally remembered this place. I only remember it b/c I am in this area during the summer after work and I kept telling myself I'm a try this place. Finally I did.  1st impression, very spacious, open concept so to speak. The windows are huge and give you a great view of the lake. The \"oyster\" bar area seems very nice, I could see it being packed during the night and turning into a lounge. The patio is their biggest selling point during the summer. Just being outdoors with the cool breeze with a lakeside view is very relaxing and beautiful.  Taking a look at the menu, price wise it's what I expected, apps ranged from $6.99 - $15.99, main dishes are $15.99 - probably $50. I say probably b/c of the lobster which is a seasonal item and depending on what time of the year you order it, it can vary in price. Nonalcoholic drinks are about $2 and up and alcoholic beverages are $5 and up. Lastly, I like how a picture of a fish besides a menu item, states that it's a house special, it makes it easier on me instead of asking everyone around me what's good.  While waiting for our food I notice a couple things. One, the waitresses were very attentive, every time they were empty handed they would stop by each table just to make sure everything was good. And if anyone needed anything they were quick to respond. Two, place got very packed, very quickly. We got there at 11 and it was empty by the time it hit 1130 both inside and out was full. Lastly, the place felt intimidating a bit. The reason being is it had a Country Club feel to it. I felt out of place and so did my friend. Everyone for some reason knew each other and there were no kids under the age of 18 if there was they were most likely with their parents. The people were either older, retired or very well established. They were also very well dressed, and here I am in cargo shorts, and a Nike t-shirt, at least I had Ray Bands on. Honestly, words can't describe the vibe that I got just head there and you'll know what I mean.  We ordered, stuffed crab, calamari, clam chowder, stuffed whitefish, haddock and pecan brownie pie. The calamari was crispy, not oily, and had a bit of spice. The sauce, which is a mayo vinaigrette concoction i think,  was out of this world good. It really complimented the calamari well. The stuffed crab was okay, I honestly couldn't taste any crab, I think the diced veggies that is added over whelms the flavor of the crab. The clam chowder was 50/50 while you could taste the freshness of the items they used, the chowder just seemed to creamy, it was very thick. The haddock, from the one bite I got was good, not greasy and the tomatoes with jalapenos had a nice kick to it. The stuffed whitefish is very well done, and can see why it was a house special. The scallops, shrimp, and crab were plentiful, to a point where you thought it was just those three items on the plate, however they don't take the spotlight. They complimented the very moist, well cooked white fish perfectly and the item that takes it to the top is the lobster cream sauce. The sauce is very rich and you can taste the lobster as if it the meat was actually there. As for the dessert, from what I was told the combination of the pecan and brownie was just right not to sweet and not to tart.   Overall, even though being intimidated a bit, I had a great experience, and would love to come back for more.There are a few items on the menu that I would like to give a try, next time though I'll dress myself up a bit more, YEAH RIGHT!  Items to definitely get:  - stuffed white fish - calamari"}
{"text":"WOW the service was amazing. I love when I can get a seat here by the water. I usually just have a glass of the house wine and the smoked salmon appetizer. It's reasonably priced and a place like no other. I will say I always I have to ask for extra cream cheese but the server is always happy to bring it to me. Great spot."}
{"text":"After hearing About snug harbour in my community very often my friend and I decided to go there for her birthday. we were disappointed that the beautiful patio over looking the water wasn't open as yet but all in all the restaurant had a beautiful view of Lake Ontario. The waiters were prompt and nice. we were going to order drinks but they were out of the smirnoffs they had on the menu (it happens).  we proceeded to order our mains we are not fans of the sea food so we both ordered the burgers with fries and a Caesar salad on the side the burger with the fries was about $16.00 and way worth the price! the burger was huge about the size of my hand , the fries were crispy and Caesar salad was fresh.My experience at Snug Harbour was excellent and I would return again."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5.   Had lunch here a couple of weeks ago for my mother in law's birthday and we found the experience ok.   Great food, good service. One less star as the kitchen was slow in getting our food out. I found the portions a little small so less half a star.   View from the Patio was nice   Will be back"}
{"text":"taken here by family for a night out...  Awesome stuff:  1. food quality is solid 2. live music (band) is really good (saturday PM) 3. amazing location 4. lots of parking 5. quality cocktails 6. the wife and I split a meal and they put it on 2 plates without asking (really awesome), vs. us having to figure it out  stuff to improve:  1. table management, your team doesn't seem to notice when smaller tables are available and they sit empty for the better part of an hour while we waited for our table of 4.  2. service - not so attentive  3. chocolate cake (mousse), great idea, but needs to be softened up before serving  Go early, or be willing to wait.  ...and bring your singing voice + dancing shoes."}
{"text":"First things first - best calamari ever. If you go out for a meal and don't order the calamari, you are seriously missing out on some scrumptious fried delicacies!   Snug is quite romantic - it sits right on Lakeshore and has a nice view of the harbour, lighthouse and the lovely stretch; beautiful during summers and quite lovely on a nice winter night as well. The restaurant itself is quite spacious, but the dim lighting during dinner makes the ambience intimate and rather cozy. This is really the perfect spot for a romantic dinner in Mississauga. They used to have live music on certain days - I am unsure if they still do that.   I was here on a group date, so we were able to try quite a few numbers off the menu. I am excited to share my opinions:   Starters:   Calamari - BEST EVER. Try it to buy what I am saying here.   Bruschetta - Ooey gooey cheesy nom nom. So good that I am left slightly speechless.  Vegetable Spring Rolls - Skippable. Infact, I recommend skipping this one.   Fish & Seafood:   Seafood Bouillabaisse - If you cannot pronounce this, don't try it to experiment. Chances are you'll be disappointed. I didn't order it, but two of my friends did, and well, it didn't look appetizing. They reviewed it pretty bland.   Fish & Chips - Huge platter. Order 1 fish if you're not sharing. I wouldn't recommend the order because this is a tad worse than fish n chips at cheaper places. The crust wasn't crispy and the haddock was too flaky. Shame that I couldn't quite use my fork or knife on it because it kept breaking; in the end, I had to use my hand, at a fine dining restaurant. Imagine my horror. This is a big skip. I really recommend skipping.   Pasta:   One of my friends ordered a custom pasta and she says it was delicious. Look quite delish too.   Verdict? I am totally coming back for appetizers and drinks with friends. Or an intimate evening with my boyfriend. I am primarily coming back for the calamari. This place is on the pricier side and dining here for sub-par dinner might not make sense. If I ever do, that plate of calamari is going to be my din-din."}
{"text":"We checked out Snug Harbor over the weekend.  Things to know -- - Great location with lots of outside eating space (under a cover if you don't like direct sun) and right on the lake! - Free Parking - very modern and pleasant decor inside  The Food: - generous portions - my hubby started with the mussels in white wine/butter sauce (very good), I had the calamari (way more than I could manage -- he had to help) - mains - we both went with Pecan Crusted Salmon - yummy!  Servers were pleasant and attentive. We enjoyed a relaxed meal and did not feel hurried at all - just enjoyed a sunny afternoon on the water!"}
{"text":"I will start my review by advising potential patrons to make a reservation especially if the plan to visit during the weekend. The entrance looked  like the waiting room in an ER.  The menu had an assortment of reasonably priced seafood,  meat and chicken. Nothing for vegetarians. We ordered some fresh oysters a mixed array of raspberry point & malpeque. The malpeque were way better than the raspberry point oysters.   For the main course, we ordered east coast salmon and fish & chips. The use Haddock for their fish, with a choice of one or two pieces for an extra $5.00.  Dessert was the chocolate lava cake. Deeelicious.  I have awarded 4 stars as the food portions are very European. Presentation was excellent, service was polite, courteous and prompt. If you are in the area, this is a restaurant you must visit."}
{"text":"My three friends and I decided to stop in for a bite during Port Credit's Busker Fest!  It was a beautiful, sunny, Sunday afternoon and it was so worth the 45-minute wait to sit out on the patio.  You can just sit back, relax by the water and watch the boats go by - such a laid back vibe.  The restaurant was modern and very clean.  Prices were excellent, given the location and our server, Aimee, was very friendly and attentive.  I had the grouper sandwich with a side caesar salad - fish was fresh and cooked to perfection and served on a perfect soft bun; caesar salad was alright but nothing to write home about.  One of my friends ordered the fish tortilla (fish tacos), which I would have gotten but, the way the menu described it, I thought it was a wrap.  Anyway, she loved it!  Next time for sure I'll get it.  We saw a lot of customers ordering fresh oysters and they looked so delicious.  We passed on it though because we were all driving and figured oysters need to washed down with a lot of martinis!  Again, next time.  I would really recommend the french fires (with gravy) as they were just out of this world and had a longer life span than your typical 10-minute french fries - so great for sharing!  If you're looking to just hang out with friends, a romantic date or even have out of town guests, I would seriously recommend coming here.  We had such a great time!"}
{"text":"Went to Snug Harbour recently for dinner.  Great place right by the lake.  Food was reasonably priced.  Had the after hours special on the menu.  Good service, and great fish.    Restaurant may be a little bit loud near the bar area, but otherwise great atmosphere and a nice view of the lake.  Reminds you that you're eating seafood there.  Highly recommended for seafood in Mississauga area!"}
{"text":"Came here once 5 years ago. I don't remember much about it. Came here again recently with my friend. I ordered the \"Southern Crusted Haddock\". I'm not usually a big fan of fish, but I really enjoyed it! It was flavourful, and juicy. I was hesitant at first about the \"cornmeal\" crust but it was very good. Even the side carrots tasted good and I definitely am not a fan of carrots. The salsa on the side was a bit too spicy for me to eat.  We sat on the sheltered patio and it was quite nice. We came on a Tuesday around 7 and it was pretty busy. I felt like the prices were a tad overpriced for the restaurant - it has more of a casual family restaurant ambiance rather than high class fancy restaurant ambiance."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is great... Except the bland food. Everything tastes like it was dusted with a magical blandness that would be impossible to find elsewhere.  The fish is rubbery, chicken is overcooked, veggies are limp, and all of the above are screaming for salt and spice. Salads are all bagged variants with no flair or soul.   Do yourself a favor and skip the meal. Stick to having drinks on the amazing lake view patio. The servers are top notch and the drink selection is nice  enough for a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Great spot by the water. If you lucky enough to get a seat outside on the patio in the summer then you get to enjoy watching the boats coming by. The seafood is good, but not the best I have had. It is also a little pricey.  Recommend for a date."}
{"text":"My 2nd time coming here. This time I will just give rating for their food.  The restaurant just have this wonderful view and nice breeze if seating outside at the patio. The food was alright and it was nothing special like my first visit as well. I tried their lobster roll this time, and I think it tasted kind of bland, but it had tons of lobster meat inside. I also had their fish and chips, and I think the fresh cut fries was more stand out than the fish. Also, there was this small piece of bread came with my fish and chips, but it was super hard. I didn't eat and just put it back on my plate. Something this hard shouldn't be on the plate as food."}
{"text":"Great patio with an excellent view.  Apps were excellent and service also excellent.  Very nice place."}
{"text":"Wow!  I haven't been here for over 10 years and it is still great!  Came here last week for a business lunch and was very pleased. Sorry for the lack of pictures but it was not appropriate for me to document in visual form.   The restaurant is vary tastefully decorated with plenty of room and lots of beautiful windows.  Classy yet warm would be my best description.   The service is amazing. We were treated with care and in a way that facilitated our ability to carry on conversations without feeling like we were being interrupted. This is very important for a business meeting. The water and drinks were there as needed and the food came out without any delay and with a very pleasant smile.   Now to the food. I had a blackened catfish with potatoes and vegetables. The last part was an allergy related change to the usual rice option. I must admit that the fish was really delicious. The potatoes and veggies were a very nice side and it was quite a sizeable portion. The other meal looked very good and half was taken home (if you are wondering how big the portions are).   Overall this place is a gem in port credit. Beautiful views, great service and good food. I can imagine like so many years ago, this place will be packed once the weather gets nicer."}
{"text":"In terms of food - not impressed at all, esp for the prices you are paying for.   You are best to stick with drinking on the patio and sharing miniscule appetizer. Refer to David X's review for more details."}
{"text":"Snug Harbour has, at long last, been completely updated and renovated.  The space is gorgeous.  Clean, modern design, but still with a cozy feel.  The restaurant has just re-opened as of March 4th  The menu has also been updated.  The food was previously not the best, but now it's so much better.  We sampled the scallop and lobster dumplings - full of seafood, the crab cakes - very crabby, no filler, the best we've had in a long time, and oysters Rockefeller - plump, juicy oysters with a delicious topping.  Good job Snug Harbour.  Hope you maintain what the renovation has brought on."}
{"text":"We had a rest experience.  The food was actually very good.  My whitefish and wife's salmon were tasty.  Too bad we missed daylight to enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing service from Mackenzie If I am remembering right, amazing food and amazing view! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I love the seafood pescatore... its sooooooo good!! The scallops are the best part.. soooo juicy and so perfectly cooked! Perfect spot for a date night!"}
{"text":"We had a family reunion luncheon here, about 20 of us.  They wouldn't take a reservation as we couldn't give a final headcount until that day.  However, they were ready for us when we descended upon them.  We were seated relatively quickly.  I had the haddock fillet, French fries, and coleslaw.  The meal was offered with one or two fillets.  I decided I just wanted one as it was lunch.  Glad I did.  It was a big portion of fish.  I would have struggled to finish the meal if I had ordered two pieces.  My wife ordered the apple walnut salad.  It came with mixed greens (not just iceberg lettuce), apple bits, roasted walnuts, mushrooms, tomatoes, Roquefort cheese, and prosciutto.  She had them top it with grilled shrimp.  The salad was quite generous in size.  Considering the size of the party, the service was relatively fast and friendly.  A nice experience in a newly renovated restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good food!  Tried the crab cakes with orange pineapple coconut curry sauce! OMG!  Had the seafood pescatore and boy oh boy!  Ummm..you definitely gotta eat here!!!  A little pricey but worth it overall!!!"}
{"text":"Been there twice and won't be back unless its just for drinks. The food is greasy and of poor quality.  Meals arrive cold....servers are super busy and harried.  if you want to sip a drink and watch the water it's still good, but not for a meal. Much better places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'm not a seafood person but I found a lot of choices at Snug Harbour Seafood Bar and Grill. They don't focus 100% on seafood, which is convenient at least for me. The interior is absolutely breathtaking and very modern. It's in a very beautiful location, right by the water, which is very nice to visit after your meal. Very clean restaurant and although it's not too expensive, people dress very nicely."}
{"text":"Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy, wine list is weak, and seafood is only barely competently prepared.   Calamari was good. Worth it, served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo.   Lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best, and \"crusted with pecans\"=sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum.   The day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is so-so. I had fried calamari which was huge, but otherwise only so-so and nothing special. The dipping sauce was meh too. I also had the lobster mac and cheese which was neither creamy nor cheesy... in fact, it was surprisingly oniony, which is not what mac and cheese is supposed to be like. It tasted like macaroni with onions and lobster in butter, with some cheese sprinkled on top. Because the calamari was so big and the mac and cheese wasn't great, I barely touched the mac and cheese, so the waitress did offer to get me something else when she saw I wasn't a big fan (though I didn't make a scene of it at all), so I'll give them a bonus for great service!"}
{"text":"After walking around J.C. Saddington Park, we were hungry (we hadn't eaten since breakfast) so we walked back to Snug Harbour.  We've been there before for drinks.  It's a big restaurant that is decked out for Christmas.  I was surprised that there weren't that many people there.  Gord had a beer from Old Credit Brewing, a local brewery.  I had planned to have supper but the menu was limited to mostly fish dishes (I'm not a fan of fish) or big meals. I was more in the mood for something fun like wings. The only appetizer that appealed to me was garlic bread with cheese so that's what I got (I gave Gord a piece).  It was okay, not great. It seemed like it had been made an hour earlier as it was warm, not hot.  Gord ordered New England Clam Chowder and said it was good.  Our server was Bianca and she took good care of us.  I'd go back for drinks but not for a meal."}
{"text":"I had just stepped off a plane a few hours earlier, so I felt a little plane dust dirty. And then Kris U tells me we're heading to a lovely place called Snug Harbor for some delectable sea creatures. I'm picturing a low key crab shack but when I walked into Snug Harbor I saw something much, much different. And then I thought, damn, I should have packed my fancy pants.  Inside, Snug is one shiny penny. Clean and modern design is showcased through the long dining room and is evident just about everywhere - from the flatware to the lighting. As for the menu, as mentioned - is full of sea creatures. It's on the pricey side ($15-$25 per entree) - especially for a lunch. However, quality wins out here!   Kris U and I began our meal with a small wheel of cheese. Well, not really, but kinda. The baked brie with mixed berry sauce is delightful. And really, who wouldn't want to make a meal out of melty brie with flavorful berries?! If you wouldn't, please stop reading.   As for my meal, I actually went with the crab cake appetizer - two small but mighty cakes atop an interesting curry like sauce. It tasted like Indian crabcakes. I mean that in a good way - it was just a very interesting take on a typical remoulade that I haven't seen/tasted before. It's a good thing I loaded up on the cheese, though, as it's most definitely an appetizer portion.   I heard Snug went through some mah-jah renos, and it looks like their hard work has paid off!"}
{"text":"Sat/May/5/18 - Lunch / 1:00pm  The Good: Quaintly located along beautiful shoreline, you will find this modern and chic restaurant a perfect destination for an upper notch seafood crave. For a date night or family meal, this is a great pick.  The menu is diverse but, not exhausting. There is plenty to pick from with something for everyone. Want to share a bowl of mussels before delicious blackened catfish and shrimp? You can do that. Got company who'd rather turf while you surf? You can do that too. You have options. There is a full drinks menu as well, if that's your thing.   The food quality is excellent for the price paid. Indeed, it leans towards the pricy side but, you do get a fresh meal prepared and plated by an actual chef. There is value in that and worth supporting.  The staff are friendly and attentive to the table. It is a point to recommend that you book a reservation in advance as it can get busy. That is also very easy to do.   If the weather is good, you can easily take a stroll around the harbour and see some nice scenery. The restaurant is very accessible.  The Bad: I don't have anything to mention here. It was not a bad experience whatsoever.   The Ugly: A minor point. The restroom did require some minor T.L.C. The garbage was well overflowing. This is understandable during a busy time but, requires attention if you're trying to keep up appearances."}
{"text":"Nicely designed place. Looks very cozy. Nice location.  Came here for oysters, but the oysters aren't that great. Better off going downtown to get better oysters for the same price."}
{"text":"This place was amazing , we went to it on a Saturday night it was busy but the wait time was pretty good around 10 to 15 minute Max !  As soon as we sat down we were served, the food came out pretty quick too .  We had the calamari and the oyster dish it was perfect portion to share we were 3 people, I my self had the lobster it came with the choice of rice or potato and saut√©ed vegetables I choose to get just the vegetables it was amazing . They even had a live band and a little dance floor the crowd was mostly family's and mature but other wise an amazing place if you are a fan of sea food defiantly recommend trying this place .  OMG I almost forgot to mention the view it is amazing !!! Right on the water if you go for lunch seat on the patio so you can look at the water amazing view for dinner on the weekend I recommend inside because of the live bad."}
{"text":"Great location , and good service.  The food is average at best, and certainly over priced, for the quality.  This was my third visit over the years. We ordered the following: Steamed Trout, Blackened catfish, coconut shrimp, and oysters. The side veggies and rice, are especially bland. This place could be much better with a bit off work, otherwise, over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great spot! Ok food but the location and drinks makeup for the rest. Servers are great, there was no wait for lunch  but when my husband was there for dinner he had to wait 45 minutes. Call for a reservation it's a hot spot."}
{"text":"Not that great. I was much more enticed to go taste fire-up, but we already had made a reservation here. The place looks nice inside, but the patio is budget. The food is average at best, and nothing special. The only thing going for them is the nice location, right on the lake.  If you're looking for seafood, this isn't the place and if you are craving steak, don't spend the extra dough and go to the keg."}
{"text":"Over priced horrible food. Good view of the lake. Other than the view , I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had my bridal luncheon here. The staff was incredibly attentive. The owner helped us plan a menu of finger sandwiches, hors d'oeuvres and wine. He was also very accommodating and easy to talk to. It cost a pretty penny, but it was hardly exorbitant. In any case it was worth it.  The view over the river is also a huge selling point. The atmosphere is welcoming and the food is delicious. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I've also been there for dinners and it was really good. They make a mean salad and salmon.  Go there because they made me appreciate Chardonnay. ikr? Apparently it has to be a bit pricey to be good."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here at all, just had a couple pints of the local \"Old Credit Micro Brew\" but how can you beat this patio ??? Its right on the water!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would be eating seafood lunch on a patio in mid-March, but this was made possible thanks to the weather gods and Snug Harbour Seafood.  There is a small patio with nice waterfront view, lots of swans swimming about and a really peaceful location.  The interior is larger, with a nice sized bar and lots of tables. Decor was slightly dated but modern enough with a typical nautical theme/twist without being over the top.  I thought the food here was really reasonably priced, lots of the mains were only $15-$20. I can't believe people think this place is overly pricey!? Huh?  I had a shrimp kebab plate which was quite tasty - large shrimps, grilled vegetables and roasted potatoes. Moro mu had a steak sandwich which was also good.  We also shared a giant Key Lime Pie slice for dessert. It was beautifully presented and very rich.   The service here was very good. They were slightly slow to get the bill, but honestly we were not in much of a rush to escape the beautiful mid-day sun."}
{"text":"Great name, and quite appropriate given its locale near the lake.  ATMOSPHERE:  Coming on a weekend it was almost an hour wait-time. Very glad we decided to stay, as the wait was quite justified. There's a reason why this place is as busy at it is.  Great decor that fits the overall harbour theme of this place. Clean and jovial feel overall. Live music, at least on the night I was there, that helps set the mood as well. Although the patio had yet to be open when I was there, it looked quite spacious, and with a great view.  SERVICE:  Food came surprisingly fast given how busy they were. Server was friendly enough, and accommodating of our needs.  FOOD:  At a seafood restaurant like this, I of course had to go for the Seafood Chowder, and I was not disappointed. Hearty and creamy, but not too creamy, and with enough clam and other ingredients to flavour.   The Chicken Dijonnaise was quite tender, and the accompanying rice and veggies went well with it. I do wish there was a bit more of the mushroom cream sauce that came on top, but perhaps I'm just being greedy.  The Lobster Mac and Cheese did not disappoint either. Although it looked like a small portion at first, the bowl had some girth to it. There was enough chunks of lobster to go along with the cream cheese pasta and pieces of tomato. It also came piping hot, as it was clearly just out of the oven.  VERDICT:  It's a bit far for me, but I would definitely make an effort to come back."}
{"text":"This is an overpriced Popeye's. It's really not anything spectacular, except for the views. With all the restaurants in the GTA, there is nothing, except the view (and private parking lot-with free parking) that would keep me coming back. Especially not at this price point."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try, and I'm glad I did.  Maybe I was a little too harsh on them in my previous review, since it was only the watiresses fault that we had a bad experience, not the entire establishments.    I made sure not to get the same waitress again and I really hope she doesn't even work there anymore.  We got a waiter this time, and he was very friendly and prompt.  The food came out quickly as well this time.    It is a bit pricey here but that is to be expected since it is a nice venue.  It was quite busy on a Thurs night, but no wait to get seated.  I would definitely come here again.  Happy with my last experience."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio, but if you're looking for a nice romatic night out, then find another place (it's always too loud in the restaurant). The food is ok, slightly on the pricier side. What lacks in food quality is more than made up for the view of the lake."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I've been disappointed several times at snug harbour and this latest occurrence is no different.  We were a party of five and order 2 dozen oysters . They were hacked apart during the shucking. An order of mussels were chewy. I would recommend the grouper sandwich which had light fried fish but was served on an awful hamburger bun. The bill came to $175 for only a couple of plates."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for years never tried it out!  What a shame because it was a great experience.  Great location, ample parking , good menu, and good service.  Clam chowders and salads for lunch was perfect and we will definitely be returning again soon."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. It was quite empty for a Saturday lunch. I still love the atmosphere but the menu can be pricey.   It's didn't come with bread which it would have been nice.   Entree: York shire pudding with shaved prime rib. The presentation looked blah but it tasted better. It could use more veggies. The gravy jus did get salty by the end of the meal. An interesting dish as I'm not a big beef eater.   Other entree: trio of seafood of mahi mahi, grilled shrimp and 3 mussels. The presentation looked better than mine. It looked fresh and appetizing. He liked his dish. Perhaps his portion could be bigger.   Verdict: I should have ordered a pizza. Nice place along the water - my second time there. Service was good. Would go back for a special event since the menu is pricey. For that price, I'll rather go to my other fav place to fill up this Cat tummy. Meow!"}
{"text":"Very popular spot, but honestly other than location it's not worth it. In have been here multiple times iver the years and quality of the food and service always been sub standard."}
{"text":"We went to snug Harbour tonight it was the worst experience we have ever had, the night started out with an hour wait then when we finally got our table the attitude of the waiter was horrible. We tried to talk to a manager but that wasn't much better he didn't care, Needless to say the food isn't much better small portions and over priced do yourself a favor don't go there."}
{"text":"Coming to this restaurant is normally a highlight of the summer for me.   Unfortunately I don't know if I'll be able to say the same going forward  I had made a reservation to bring my friend and we were seated promptly (tip: always try to get a reservation)  We sat down and ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell to eat while we decided on the rest of the menu  This being a fish restaurant I had expected a larger selection of fish on the menu, and I was hoping to see some grilled.   Both my friend and I ended up getting the baked rainbow trout (me due to a sodium issue, her due to allergies)  The portion was generous, but rather tasteless.   I had asked for steamed vegetables, but I am pretty sure they had butter on them.  I got an extra side of rice and a salad and both were delicious  My friend being lactose intolerant had no dessert options which was kind of disappointing   Our server Jessica was fantastic, but there was only so much she could do in the situation   If the fried grouper sandwich returns to the menu, I would recommend getting that"}
{"text":"This used to be an amazing seafood restaurant and our family would come here regularly once a month. But after a couple of disappointing visits years ago we just stopped coming here. Burned fish, greasy fish & chips, and overall just average tasting dishes. So the quality of the dishes was going down and the prices were going up.  We just went there again last week for old times sake and it was again just an average experience. Although I must admit that I always liked their calamari ( a little bit on the greasy side )."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service that matches it.  My kids pizza was a poor excuse for pizza in my opinion.  Same with the salad I ordered.  Not sure how you mess those basics up!  My husband's fish and chips were good from what he said.  You're paying for the views."}
{"text":"For my boyfriend and I, Snug Harbour is like that reliable friend you can always count on. We've been here several times, it's got a great location in Port Credit, probably the only restaurant right by the lake, excellent patio, great service... It's always busy but we usually sit at the bar, the staff there is very friendly and they offer full menu service. They have local brews, kuddos for always having Old Credit on tap. As for the food, we've only had appetizers with our drinks but everything else on the menu (and the other tables) looks great. We went on St. Patrick's day and had the fried calamari and the jerk chicken, yummy! We've also had the mussels and the oysters.  If you want to sit at a table be sure to make a reservation, otherwise there's usually room at the bar."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were wandering around Port Credit looking for a place to have a late lunch/early dinner. He had been to Snug Harbour before and enjoyed it so we decided to stop by and enjoy the view.   Let me start by saying that my boyfriend is not much of a foodie nor is he really picky. I'm not picky but I like good food and I'm willing to pay for it.   Snug Harbour is in a lovely spot right in Port Credit on the water. They have plenty of tables outside so you can watch the boats go by. It is a fairly casual spot but there were a few people there in the evening that were dressed to go out. I do believe they offer live music some nights at this place.   Now on to the food. The menu was your typical seafood and casual fare. Lots of calamari, shrimp, mussels, various fish dishes and stuff for the non seafood lovers like steak , burgers and pizza.   We started with an order of Buffalo Shrimp which were not bad but as usual didn't really taste like shrimp. They were dusted with a spiced flour mixture then fried and served with a lemon mayo. For our mains I had the Keoni Island salmon which was a fresh Salmon fillet marinated in soy sauce, port wine, brown sugar and crushed garlic. Coated with toasted sesame seeds and then char-grilled. It was served with some rather boring roast potatoes and the obligatory carrots. The fish wasn't bad but the accompaniments were pitiful. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster Macaroni which had Cuban Lobster Tail with macaroni, aged old cheddar, white wine and roasted tomatoes. This wasn't bad and the portion size was good. I'm not sure it was worth $23.50 but it wasn't bad.   When it came time for dessert the server brought over a plate that had a piece of every dessert they offered. I thought at one point my boyfriend was going to tackle the poor girl and take off with the plate but he controlled himself. They had a pretty good selection that included key lime cheesecake, marble cheesecake, apple cinnamon cheesecake, brownies, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate mouse cake and pecan pie. I opted for the apple cinnamon cheesecake and my better half settled on pecan pie. Both were okay. I ended up giving most of mine to my boyfriend.   When all was said and done the bill was over a $100. That included a glass of wine and a beer. A little overpriced in my books but at the end of the day you're paying for the view."}
