{"text":"Sorry, but no.  I was looking forward to real Mexican food, this ain't it.  The people who work there are SUPER nice.  I hope they do well."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Awesome food awesome service. They even have great food for kids. They have the best quesadillas in the area. Nice to finally have other options aside from American and Italian food."}
{"text":"Not for me, unfortunately. The beans were delicious, and the rice was good. The tacos themselves, however, were way too greasy. It overpowered any flavor the tacos had. Food was overpriced as well."}
{"text":"There food was great. The taste was awesome. Service was great, very friendly. There was a good amount to choose from. Its a small place but full of heart."}
{"text":"I once had a place try to replace Carne Asada with ground beef. If you like that sort of thing, Tex-Mix Grill is not for you! I went there for lunch and I'm already planning to return for dinner. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Service was the worst I have ever experienced. The staff there got in argument with customer for 10 minutes terrible customer service also. Got attitude because the cook messed up our order. Food was alright not the best. Seems like they really didn't care that they gave us a bad experience"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after seeing some Facebook posts about them opening up in the area. I was really glad that I did. The food was very filling!  I got takeout so I can't rate the wait service.   The location is very small but with food that good it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly. The waitress is so friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  I cannot race enough about how good the food is. Perfect portion sizes"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada tacos in PA! The corn tortillas are really good. The staff was really friendly."}
