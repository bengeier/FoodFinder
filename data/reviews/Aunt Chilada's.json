{"text":"I read all the bad reviews but still decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and go eat there. Bad idea. The food was terrible. Please do yourself a favor and listen to the bad reviews. They are all true."}
{"text":"The food is okay, though pricey. They know they are one of few choices for a resort, and the service reflects it. They wait staff could really care less."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin! Way Over priced for the quality of food! We decided to give this place a shot since we are staying at the Resort and didn't want to go too far tonight since we had a long day! I wish we had! The food is Terrible!!!! I I ordered pollo fundido and it had no flavor ! Boiled chicken breast covered in a cream sauce with cheese. I picked steamed veggies and black beans! The provided refried black beans when I was hoping for whole and the veggies were over cooked and bland! Salsa is not good at all and tortillas were not fresh!   My husbands carne Asada was horrible as well!  Do not bother!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Pretty good.  I got a lunch combination with the standard stuff (taco, enchilada, and tamale).  I wasn't a fan of the tamale.  It was too dried out.  The taco and enchilada were really good.  It says that everything is made in house.  It's a shame that  I won't be able to return too soon since I'm rarely in the Phoenix area, which may be a good thing in itself."}
{"text":"Pretty average Mexican food with friendly service. Outdoor seating can be really dark and sort of uncomfortable because of their low chairs. Prepare for a large retiree/vacation crowd from the nearby Arizona Grand Resort."}
{"text":"It was July 4th and with many restaurants closed today, Aunt Chilada's was open for business.    We were visiting with a friend and we greeted with Salsa and Chips which was both fresh and flavorful.  We then ordered the Pollo Fundido which is generally one of our favorite dishes.  Given that they used Chicken Tenders it was rather dry and so trying to flavor it becomes tough. The white sauce was good and over all the food was average.  While the food was average the service was excellent.  Beverly was fantastic and wish there was a Beverly at every restaurant that we went to.  She made our every experience a fantastic one.  Even though the food was A-OK, the service made it a very very pleasant experience.  Thanks Beverly for your undivided attention when we were there."}
{"text":"First of all, I must say, Connor is by far the most wonderful server I have ever had. Second, this is the most tasty and high-quality mexican food in the area.   When we first arrived at said restaurant, our wonderful server by the name of Connor greeted us warmly with a big smile (and very charming dimples). The young man took us to a nice table by the windows that overlooked the pond, where we captured the moments of young ducklings following their parent ducklings. Very serene moments to enhance our dining experience.  Connor took our drink orders: I asked him about each of the margaritas, and proceeded to choose the \"Sangria-rita\", a creative collaboration of sangria and a margarita. It was very tasty, Connor made a great recommendation. My two friends each got the house margaritas; one frozen, one on the rocks; and only one with salt. Surprisingly, despite how busy the restaurant was (it was about 15 after 5p.m.), Connor returned with our margaritas almost immediately. Go Connor! *High-five*  Next, Connor informed us about the table-side guacamole, which we decided to order. He came back with an entire set-up: about four avocados, diced onion, cilantro, tomato, lemon and lime, salt and pepper, and some cheese for the cheese lovers out there (I do not prefer cheese in my guacamole). He made the guacamole exactly to our preferences and held a wonderful conversation with us the entire time. Such a dapper young man!  We proceeded to order our entrees, which were also delicious. Connor recommended the chicken chimichangas and the beef enchiladas, which were both incredible and served sizzling hot.   Overall, we were very pleased with our experience. We especially loved our server, Connor; who not only made sure we enjoyed our dinner, but our experience as a whole. If you ever go dine there, ask for Connor. He has strawberry-blonde hair, dimples, eyes as blue as the water surrounding the restaurant, and a wonderful smile.  Next time we are on this side of town, we will undoubtably be visiting this location again (and requesting Connor as our server)! Loved our experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrible. Waited over an hr for out food on a Thursday. (It was not that busy) Ben the bartender did make some good drinks."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's s simply put, just OK.  They have a pretty big menu, but I don't know that I would say they have a speciality.  The nice thing about AC's is that they have a big patio area and they are great for larger groups.  So if you are looking to sneak away for a long lunch in the sun on a spring day or if you have your office lunch (we take our new hires here) and need the space, then come here.    Now, if you are looking for some great full flavored Mexican, then keep on looking.  The chips and salsa are good here and after that, everything kind of blends in as the typical mexican."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice but they did not have enough staff to service customers even on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Great Food and our server was outstanding! Brittany M. was awsome handled our party of 16 with ease. Not one of us was ever empty handed. We will be back!  Mike G."}
{"text":"Aunt Chiladas: bad name, even worse food. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend eating here.  I think this restaurant's proximity to the Arizona Grand hotel is the only reason it's still around. We were staying at the Arizona Grand, and decided to order take-out for our group of five people.  I ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans as a side. What I received was a soggy burrito, with half chicken and half shredded beef (I don't eat red meat). That was unfortunate, but they didn't include the beans either- there was only rice as a side.  I thought the salsa was decent, but the chips were extremely greasy and not really worth eating.  Bottom-line: I'd pass on this place if I were you- there's lots of good Mexican restaurants around here more deserving of your business."}
{"text":"Nice patio seating but didn't like having to see straight into the dirty kitchen every time the door opened. We waited a long time for someone to take our order, and even longer for the food to arrive and it was cold when it finally did. Not good! Waitress was apologetic although the problems were not entirely her fault. Overpriced for this kind of menu."}
{"text":"The one thing I can say is that the service was fast! I ordered takeout but the location is the worst I can think of. It's right on the southwest side of baseline and the I-10 but it's facing north so if you're traveling west when you leave this place you'll be waiting a good 5-10 minutes before you can turn left!"}
{"text":"We were thinking of going to Garcia's at Arizona Mills Mall and decided to go here instead. It wasn't a big mistake but would have been more satisfied at Garcia's.  The table we were sat at was too close to other tables for that \"intimate\" feel. Our server was great, however. The food wasn't all that good. They bring you chips and salsa. The salsa, in my opinion wasn't that great.  Most likely won't be coming back as there are better options out there."}
{"text":"The food was okay not the best, my mom got chicken in her salad which was raw on the inside. They luckily fixed it but did not remove anything from our bill. My food was okay (I got the burro) I would not recommend this place. My refried beans did not taste very good either, I think beans out of a can would taste better than these."}
{"text":"I dined here about 4 years ago; it was fabulous!   We had out of town guests in for a visit and wanted to treat them to Mexican fare at a venue with outdoor (patio) seating.   Recalling our positive experience from four years ago, it seemed as though Aunt Chilada's was the best option.   Sadly, this restaurant has really gone down hill.    We ordered a pitcher of margaritas - and were very disappointed.   It seemed as though it was pre-made and had been sitting around for a while.  The taste was less than desirable and certainly not worth the money.    The food was marginal --  nothing to get excited about.    I felt really let down and disappointed.     Thankfully our friends didn't know the difference; however, having had much better --- we will not go back.  We were rushed through the ordering process --- the guest check was delivered before we had a chance to finish the meal.       To sum it up, what used to be a wonderful dining experience is now the last place on my list to visit.    I'm not sure what happened, but I'll not spend another dime at this facility."}
{"text":"I used to love to go here. The food used to be excellent every time you went. Now you never know what to expect and the prices are too high for the so-so food. I will go back again someday but not real soon. For a family of 4 dinner after my son's graduation cost $65. Way to expensive for mediocre food."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary the other night. the service was great and the food was really good. I got the fish tacos and they are some of the best I've ever had. And I'm picky. The queso dip is phenomenal. Unfortunately the wife and I got sick that night. Don't know if it's related but it easy pretty bad. Good place overall but I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Margaritas were weak.   Service was slow. Food was OK, but not worth the steep prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. The food was very bland and uninspired. However, the drinks were very tasty. Our server was not the worst. But, definitely not the best. However, the manager was excellent. She came and asked how everything was. When I replied that it was just OK, she wanted details. The manager was very appreciative of my feedback and even took my fish tacos off of the check (something I did not expect). Also, they accidentally charged my card too much. The manager that I spoke to was very concerned and understanding. He even went to their accounting department to verify that their records only showed the correct charge. Although my first experience with the food was not great, I am considering giving them another shot thanks to the excellent managers."}
{"text":"I went here for an event and I was not impressed by the food. The guacamole was tasteless, the beef flautas tasted like chicken and was extremely salty, the chicken chimichangas were another salt bomb, the refried beans didn't have much taste and the cheese enchiladas were probably the only thing that tasted somewhat decent (just tasted liked cheese). The service was nice and the place is colorful, but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"I do not feel like this place is worth a stop for dinner if you like good food.  It is over-priced for food that is so ordinary and un-Mexican tasting to me.  The salsa was ok and I Iiked the the rice and beans.  The chicken in my burrito wasn't good and didn't like the texture or the way it was cooked. It was pretty much flavorless. The food is very ordinary.    For 4 adults and 2 little kids at dinner it was $77 with tip and we only had tea and water. I would have enjoyed the flavors of the food at Qdoba or Chipotle better and it would've cost less.  It's a neat building and I enjoyed sitting outside in the evening. I guess we pay a premium for that. The service we had was good, and I can tell the wait staff works hard to serve. I seem to remember that 10-15 years ago the food was much better.   I would not recommend Aunt Chilada's to someone that wants good Mexican food. I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"I am from Virginia and loved how fresh and authentic the food was here, thank you for the wonderful service Tia!"}
{"text":"I ordered the happy hour special 1 shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada.  The food tasted really commercial and the HOT salsa wasn't that hot. But the service was fantastic! Based on the food quality it's nothing special, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We went there a year and a half ago and the food and service were great.  Tonight was a different story.  Chips were half full of broken ones on the bottom. Service was indifferent and half-hearted. Food was just OK, if you think that a soggy Chimichanga should have the texture of a burrito and you really, really like salt. Ran out of water. Never refilled. Ran out of chips. Never refilled. Table not bused until the waiter needed a place to put the check.  I noticed that they add a 20 percent gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Thankfully, we were only three. Normally I tip well even for bad service, but not for bad food AND bad service."}
{"text":"Say Uncle!! By The Rue  Dinner at Aunt Chilada's, Oh what a plan, The food was decent, Just a little bland, Chips were warm, I ate with my hand, Hostess was cute, Legs very tanned, Do you play air guitar? Let's start a band, Chicken chimichanga, Didn't taste like sand, Chile poblano, Might have been canned, Bar tender was good, The bar he manned, Fish from a boat, Or fish off of land, I really doesn't matter, Even if you planned, Did you know in baseball, Pete Rose was banned, Ron Paul has a son, His name is Rand, This ends my review, Yes, it was grand!  Paquito!"}
{"text":"Did dinner here on a Saturday night in July.  Wife wanted Mexican and I'm not a big fan.  We were sat quickly at a table for two.  My first impression was the place was not that clean.  The menus felt sticky and so did the table.  We then ordered drinks.  They have Cabo Wabo which is great as my wife and I love this stuff!  I got the large size margarita and she got the regular.  It went down way to easy and was delicious.  The chips and salsa were very good and fresh.  Next we ordered guacamole, and if you read of the menu it says \"table side.\"  This meant to is that they were to make it at our \"table side.\"  Instead the waitress brought us a bowl of guacamole that looked like it had been sitting in the back.  I think she was being lazy.  I then asked for it to be made fresh at the table.  She was happy to do so and by god it was worth it.  The waitress did a fantastic job and prepared it just the way we liked it!!  After eating all the chips, salsa, and guacamole, we were nearly full so we decided to split an entree.  We ordered the nachos with ground beef (wife's choosing).  They came out in average time or maybe just a tax more.  They were not stellar but not bad at all.  I would split them as an appetizer again but wouldn't do it as an entree.    And by the way, this Mexican food didn't make me blow up a toilet thereafter.    Success."}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations and wish I hadn't.  The service left a lot to be desired; the prices were outrageous for the quality of the food. It would take a lot of convincing for me to ever return. Not worth the trip in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went here as part of a conference event. The staff was really friendly and attentive. The food was decent. We were in the back in a separate venue area, which was a little crammed for how many of us were there but otherwise was fine."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food was no good. The best part was the salsa and chips but the service was great."}
{"text":"Simply, too expensive for the bland tasting food. Not authentic, service is slow, and the fideo is gross."}
{"text":"Middle of the road Mexican food. Don't forget its manage by the AZ grand hotel. Wait staff for lunch was fine. Arnold Palmer was awful how tough can that be!  More expensive than it needs to be, over priced and underwhelming lunch experience."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I went to he website and saw the Pollo Fundido and immediately started to head east to the Tempe location. Host and waitress were friend and pleasant. My disappointment came from the \"chicken\" not actually being chicken. Instead they were \"chicken bi-products\" chicken strips that weren't  even seasoned or grilled. You know the frozen \"grilled\" ones? They were microwaved and covered in the fundido sauce. The Fideo was seasone by obviously very old.   My pinacolada was nothing to brag about. Mediocre at best. Though the menu did specify chicken strips, I expected \"real\" quality chicken seasoned and grilled. Especially consider the price of the entree. I can only imagine what the beef is like. Perhaps it comes in a can? Becky the waitress was empathetic and offered to remove the entree from my bill. Customer service was good. Good was bad. Music...... was entertaining."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating. Meals have big portions, best Spanish rice I've ever had, and the enchilada sauce was very good! Margaritas are nice and strong as well.  You can tell that this restaurant is well-managed, they go out of their way to make things right for the customer."}
{"text":"It was an average at best.  Very over priced for lunch, margaritas are $11.50.  Lunch for 3 with tip was over $100.  The food was ok, the beef was kinda strange not worth $100. Restaurant is cute and comfy however Macayos would have been half the price and the food is the same quality.  My opinion this is a one time stop restaurant.  The waiter was friendly and nice but me messed up our order twice."}
{"text":"Waited at a table for over 20 minutes and a server did not come to say hello or take drink orders.  It appeared short staffed with minimal servers.  We left the restaurant without an apology or even a willingness to make it right.  This is not the reataurant if you want service of any kind!"}
{"text":"The start is for atmosphere, food is awful. No flavor whatsoever. Drinks are over priced . I was expecting a good Margarita for 13 dollars but it was just like the food. No flavor. I will not come back nor recommend anyone ."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything when trying a new restaurant, so it's unfortunate the hostess was very rude to me. If I wasn't starving and my lunch options were limited (staying on property with no transportation), I would have walked right out. The hostess ignored me at the hostess stand (however happily asked the woman BEHIND me for her name) then never mentioned I could sit in the \"high top\" area (was eating alone) which was empty. Rather she had me wait 20 min to put me at a table for four in a room with a party of 10. Aside from the bad initial reaction, the food was just OK. I got the fish tacos which were Fine, nothing special (surprised to find a layer of cheese at the bottom). The chips were bland but the margarita made up for this un-memorable visit."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday for a late lunch.  No one greeted us as we walked in and we waited there for a few minutes, the bartender glancing over at us once but largely ignoring us the whole time. When the girl came out of the back, she said she was sorry and blamed the computers being down for her not being at the front. She then took us across the patio and into an uncomfortably cold room with a bunch of flies buzzing around. There was a strong smell of chemical cleaners. We were greeted by our server within a few minutes. He asked us for our drink orders (just sodas) and came back a few minutes later with those and our chips with salsa.  The chips were great; fresh. warm, and lightly salted. The salsas, though, tasted jarred and not fresh at all. They were okay; it would've been really easy to just chop up some fresh cilantro and mix it in to give it a brighter flavor. Tasted like Sam's Club salsa.  While ordering, my mom asked if they had any specials and our server paused, looked unsure, and just said \"Uhhh no, I don't think so,\" and then asked what we wanted. After ordering, he came around to top off our drinks and chips somewhat often, but it took 35 minutes for us to get our food with almost nobody else eating at the restaurant.  When our food came, our plates were hot and there was a dried crust on top of my beans; a clear sign of sitting under a heat-lamp for 5 or 10 minutes. I ordered the \"Street Tacos\" with el pastor, carnitas, and swordfish. What little meat was actually on the plate was buried under a massive pile of cabbage, shredded cheese, and red onions. I literally couldn't tell which taco had which meat in it until I bit into it. With no sauce, all of the \"fillers\" on the tacos made for a very dry, veggie-heavy bite. Carnitas was nothing special; swordfish was decent, but had too much spice for the delicate flavor of the fish; el pastor just tasted like someone grilled pork with nothing on it but orange juice. Black beans were alright, but certainly not the best I'd ever had.  My girlfriend had the guacamole on her burrito and said it tasted bland and flat, as though it had been in a refrigerator for a few days. She also said the big chicken burrito she got was \"average\".  When our server came to clear our dishes, I had eaten one taco (the carnitas, out of hunger) and maybe a bite out of the others. He asked if I was finished, I said \"Yes,\" and he just took it without asking if I enjoyed everything as there was still more than half of my food left. If he didn't care or even notice that I didn't eat a big part of my meal, I don't care to bring up the problem, especially when the rest of my experience was so mediocre.  Even while accounting for the computers being down, our server still took a long time to write out the bill and bring it to us. By that time, we were there for 75 minutes and wound up spending 90 there before leaving.  Each time the door opened up (they have two buildings and have to bring food out of one, through the patio area, and into the other), more flies flew in and they kept landing on all of our food and drinks.  The theme is really forced. The colors are obnoxiously bright and some of the decorations look like tacky garage-sale items. The music is really loud (where we were) and some of the songs were really annoying and repetitive.  They bring food out of the kitchen through a tiny hallway next to the bar, around a series of blind corners. This hallway is also where the restrooms are and my mom nearly knocked over a server carrying a huge tray of sizzling food, and she had to back out of the hallway before going into the restroom. The server then came right through the entrance part of the restaurant, forcing people just walking in to move out of the way.  Overall impressions:  Pros:  + Food wasn't terrible + Server was polite + Menu offers a few more traditional Mexican items than your average Americanized Mexican restaurant  Cons:  - Food wasn't noteworthy; maybe a 5/10. What wasn't fresh was boring and what tasted fresh had flaws with flavor and ingredient balance. - Server seemed unknowledgeable and was slow, even with almost no one else dining. - Theme and music got annoying after awhile - Flies buzzing in our faces  Lasting thought: Just another mediocre Americanized Mexican restaurant with more attention to theme and atmosphere than on food and service quality. Not sure on the night-life (the patio would probably be nice and they have a full-service bar), but this early-afternoon meal left me still searching for some classic juicy, tangy, fresh, crunchy, and creamy Mexican food. I could've gone to a hole-in-the-wall Mexican food place, spent 15 minutes, spent half the money, and had the same amount of food on a completely different quality level.  Recommendation: If you want to spend $13 for a plate of average food with average service surrounded by a very forced theme, go for it. If not, look for lunch and early dinner elsewhere. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Went to this place while on vacation in Tempe. Place looked chill from the outside and we were starving so my friends and I decided to check it out. The salsa tasted like someone put a jar of oregano in it. It was awful! I ordered a Carnitas burrito. I had to ask them to add beans and rice to a 10 dollar burrito. I was like what the hell?? Asked them to put green sauce on it as well. It was sooo bland and boring. Green sauce had no spice or flavor. Would not recommend this place. Crappy and overpriced. My friends dish was also very bland. Should of went to Del Taco. The good side was that the Staff was friendly.."}
{"text":"Much better than expected based on the reviews.  I would  go back to the restaurant and I recommend it based on our experience. We were a group of 10 and everyone liked the food.....the street tacos I had were really delicious and the portions were generous. Guacamole, chips and salsa were fine.  We are from California so know Mexican food pretty well and this food was very good ..... not the best ever but still very good.  We ordered the guacamole in addition to the free chips and salsa.   The patio at night was so pleasant and the service we had was excellent. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could rather than just 3.   I do not give 4 or 5 stars very easily!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time in decades.  The chili relleno was delicious. My server, Julie, was friendly and very helpful in answering my questions about ingredients and suggesting items that would suit my needs."}
{"text":"Food is terrible! Margaritas are terrible! You should be ashamed of yourself calling this a Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was like eating Mexican food in Sun City. Bland without creative texture or flavor. Drinks very week 99% mix."}
{"text":"My family and I were going to see a movie at the Mill and didn't want \"mall food\". We decided to try this place as we all LOVE mexican food and heard good things about this place. The wait was over an hour @ 7pm, so we dined in the lounge area. NEVER AGAIN !!!! The salsa was AWFUL, no flavor at all, chips were cold and it took 10 minutes to get drinks and the bean dip ( that was cold in the center). Our order came our fairly prompt, but WRONG DISHES. My chimi had no vegetables in it and my son's chimi was cool in the center. The server did correct my order after several minutes, but my family was almost done eating by the time it got there. If you want to go during the day to sit on the patio to have a beer/drink, its OK. Just don't eat anything !!"}
{"text":"YUM! Good food, ok atmosphere, good staff."}
{"text":"We had a great experience and really great food at Aunt Chilada's ... we're visiting and it was recommended to us by a local.  The food was great quality (the queso dip especially) and everyone (6 of us) all had different entrees and we all enjoyed the flavors.  I can't eat very spicy foods and this was all perfect.  The service (shout out to our waitress Ashley) was excellent!  She truly appreciated our business and had a vested interest in our dining satisfaction.   The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars was because it took a really long time for food to get to our table and we were one of only 3 tables in the restaurant.  I would go back again however ...and ask for Ashley as our server!"}
{"text":"My family & I wanted to give this place another try as we only ate there one time two years ago. Huge mistake! The food was absolutely horrible! The chicken was rubbery, the tortillas tasted like leather and my daughters quesadilla was runny... we've eaten at several Mexican restaurants and know what fresh, authentic Mexican food tastes like. This place is the worst. And to top it all off, it's WAY overpriced. Please save your money & go elsewhere. Too bad it's one of the only choices right next to the AZ Grand resort..."}
{"text":"I fail to understand how other people's experiences could be any different from mine at this horrid place. I am a very easy customer - just need no flies in my food, and the waitress to get my order right after the 3rd time! BUT, this place brought out the unhappy in me ( thrice!!). Never going back, ever!!!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, so Aunt Chilada's is always a convenient option for Mexican. The hardest part is getting past the name, which sounds about as authentic as Taco Bell.  My wife and I stopped in on a Monday night, and the place was packed with people from far-off places like Buffalo, New York. I can't imagine these gringos know much about the great Mexican food here in Phoenix, so Aunt Chilada's is a passable ambassador, especially for the spice-averse.  We opted for immediate seating at the bar and dove into the chips and salsa, which really can hold their own alongside the best in Phoenix. Couldn't order guacamole without tomatoes (my wife is allergic), but the fresh Dos Equis Lager drafts made up for it.  I got the pollo fundido, grilled chicken smothered in cheese and cream sauce. Other restaurants add some spice to their fundido, but I had to make do with a single smoked jalapeño served on top. While the sides of noodles and black beans were piping hot, the entrée was approaching lukewarm, and the accompanying tortillas barely held together. Still, I was craving something along the lines of Macayo's Baja Burro, so I enjoyed the fundido in spite of the temperature issues.  The bartenders were friendly enough, but the place lacks the upbeat vibe of a place like Macayo's. Chalk it up to the average age of the patrons or the awkward parking situation.  I live close enough to this Aunt Chilada's that I'm sure I'll be back. Next time, I hope it's just for drinks and chips. If I have to eat dinner, though, it's definitely not the worst."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I miss my fajitas coming out sizzling. Environment was rather loud from the other patrons (we were seated inside the main building). All in all I would recommend and go again. Oh if you are going for a large bar, you will be sorely disappointed. Plan on just ordering ypur drinks at the table, as it (the bar area) is rather small."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. I had a slight issue with my order that got taken care of quickly. Our waiter was very nice. The atmosphere is very loud if there is anybody else in the restaurant, no sound buffer. Food was not great. I ordered the carne Asada burro. I was looking forward to it, but when it arrived i was disappointed to see it was cut up pot roast. My mother ordered chicken salad, she didn't like the chicken at all. The salsa was nothing special and the guacamole was super spicy. I don't think I will ever come back, but it could be worth it for you."}
{"text":"Decent food. BIG portion sizes. Ok service, forgot to bring things that we asked for such as water."}
{"text":"the restaurant we really wanted to try was closed on a Monday so we went to Aunt Chilada's.  It was 2nd time I'd been there in 3 years;  I forgot I was there a few years ago.  Food is FAIR to average (at best) for mexican.  Nice outdoor area.  Will not likely return, there are plenty of places that are MUCH better for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is just Meh, and I really don't have much to say about it, other than it's an expensive kind of Meh, but they recently removed all of the Pokémon GO stops from the area, as well as near other local businesses. It makes for a boring evening if you're a GO player, or have kids."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food but this is one of my favorite places to eat period!! A few weeks back my husband bought me home  carry out order... And I was so pleased to see the portions were bigger with my carry out!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food!! The shredded beef enchilada was fantastic!!  If only there was one in Texas."}
{"text":"The server was great and the drinks were good. I had a mojito and house margarita. Being a pescatarian it's always a challenge eating out especially for mexican food. I called ahead and they do use lard in their refried beans and chicken stock in their rice for any vegans, vegetarians or pescatarians out there. I ordered the fish tacos and they were some of the worst fish tacos I've ever had!! They were way too fishy and had no other flavor. I had to add salsa and lemon to make them edible. My friend had the swordfish tacos and those looked and tasted way better except they had a bit too much pepper. If I go back I will order those. The black beans were pretty good."}
{"text":"My dad ordered a chile relleno.... and it came out with what looked like chicken inside?? what the??? I flagged down our sweet server Norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way, Aunt chilada's does.  It seriously looked like canned chicken and I was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside.  My dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky.  Salsa was average... nothing about this place was \"mexican\" and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out.  NEVER again will I spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company.  Aunt Chilada's... you FAIL!"}
{"text":"We attended a group event here a few months ago, the set-up was nice, the food was ok, bland but typical for a large group meeting."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Try the Chili Relleno.  Great patio day or nite.  Parking may be a little tite."}
{"text":"Meal was well prepared and the wait staff is very friendly.  the serving size is more than adequate and you will have plenty left to take home.  I was not fond of the Fidoro ( mexican spaghetti) I Will stop here again when back in the area."}
{"text":"Can't beat their happy hour! $4 enchiladas, burritos, tacos. $3 wine, beer, well drinks. Very good service very nice environment."}
{"text":"We ordered the nachos grande and they came out with burned chips all the way around the plate. They were piled high so we ate around the burned sections. Orders the número siete with shredded beef and chicken enchiladas, Mexican rice, and fiedo. The beef one wasn't bad, the chicken one was a solid piece of chicken so kinda hard to eat compared to the usual shredded chicken most places have. The staff was kinda rude and barely came around to check on drinks or how things were."}
{"text":"I love the food here, and great great service.  I love to sit on the patio in the spring, it is a very nice atmosphere.  Plenty of good food to choose from on the menu and the portions and sides are generous for the prices.  Never had a margarita so can't judge that but the beer tastes good."}
{"text":"Always a fun time! No real happy hour specials, but they do have a small free buffet. The food is pretty good. Weekend Nights usually have a live band. A decent selection of beer."}
{"text":"My friend's rehearsal dinner was held here in one of their private rooms (with our own restroom which was a happy bonus!). We had a party of slightly over 20 people with 1 waitress; however, I must say that she did a great job and handled the big party well! She kept the drinks coming all night and was on top of all our requests.  When we arrived, they had chips and salsa already set throughout the tables. The salsa was decent, not spicy at all (I do have to say that as a Mexican, what I find \"not spicy\" my fiancé will think is hot). One thing I will suggest that I had never realized was a \"thing\" was to request flour tortilla chips instead of the traditional corn that they bring you. A friend requested them and let me sample, and they were much better than the corn chips! (I must've been living under a rock) For my entrée I ordered a beef chimichanga. The chimi was not fried at all, it was more like a burrito smothered in the sauce (which didn't have a good flavor) so I didn't eat very much of it. The rice and beans were not great either but after trying the chimi, I hadn't expected them to be. Overall, we had great service but the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I loved the chips and salsa, the tacos were great but I honestly can't remember anything else about this place.  went here last week and it was fine, not over priced but cool casual spot.  I did like the noodle thing they have as a side dish, I know others don't have the same thoughts but I added a little salsa and beans and it was quite tasty :) I think it's worth going at least once, but I personally am not planning on being a regular."}
{"text":"Not a very big fan of mexican food but this place has some very good menu items that are authentic and tasty. Their rice is amazing, I always have a hard time finding a restaurant with good spanish rice.  The salsa is so good and I always oreder some to go. The service is always spot on, and the deep fried ice cream is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"We waited about a half an hour for a table after being told 15 minutes. When we walked in there were empty tables everywhere and only a couple of people had left while we were waiting. The food was horribly overpriced for the quality and they charged $3.00 for a side of sour cream or guacamole, each. Our bill was $60 for only two people and we didn't even have an appetizer. Just one soda and one cocktail. We went with friends and because there were 6 of us total, not including an infant, they put a 20% gratuity on each of our tickets automatically not the standard 17%-18%. I am usually a generous tipper and if you impress me I will give you a 20% without batting an eye. The server was not impressive. He was curt almost to the point of being rude and did not deserve more than 15%. We will never go back here again!"}
{"text":"We went to Aunt Chilada's hoping to get a lite lunch. We weren't that hungry but the place looked inviting from the street. Once inside the hostess greeted us with a smile so we were off to a good start. But its all downhill from here. We told her \"two for lunch please\". We noticed the high-top tables in the front area were empty yet she led us out the back of the building and into another building at a VERY small table against the wall that barely seats two. We were next to a party of 12 having some kind of business/lunch meeting. Very awkward. Our server came and without greeting us handed us the menus and asked for a drink order. We hadn't even looked at the menu yet. We both said water because she appeared to be in hurry, yet the place was not busy. We scanned the menu looking for the \"Lunch\" section. Nothing. Ok, she must have given us the wrong menu. When she returned I asked for the \"Lunch\" menu and she said \"You have it, its the same as dinner.\" Ok, give us a minute. We looked at the party of 12 and their plates were HUGE. We didn't want a huge $50.00 lunch just something lite. So we decided to split one of their burrito dinners.  Even that was going to be too much food for lunch. We could tell the server was a little irked when we told her we were going to split the burrito dinner. The food came in about 3 minutes! So much for freshly prepared. She didn't bring an extra plate so we placed it in the middle and dug at it from both sides. Very bland!. Plate had more beans than rice. The tortilla chips were plain and unsalted. She came back with the check and I noticed there was a $1.00 charge on it for enchilada style. What??? Maybe that was for the extra plate we didn't get. We paid the check and left a small tip. Never going back."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant excited to try another Mexican restaurant. I ordered a beef chimichanga, I had the beans, rice and fideos as well. And it was delicious. I Would put more effort in the salsa for the chips, I was not sure if it was canned or not. I ordered it to go, so I do not know how a complete experience in the restaurant would rate. But I heard some employees worried that some patrons would not be able to hear each other because their tv was too loud and they were trying to fix the problem. The gentleman helping me was very polite."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food, good drinks, nice location"}
{"text":"This place is aggravating.  I think it's because when you hear of Mexican food in the Phoenix Metro area... this is place ALWAYS gets mentioned... and WHY?? ugh, aggravating!  And then you go... and are like \"Okay... I can see it, the duck pond is purty.\" and then u enter and are stared at by every half drunk person in the bar and are then shown to your table. It's a little busy and people seem to be enjoying themselves.... alright, another good sign of goodness to come. The chips and salsa are even decent....   and then the server comes. And she can BARELY speak a word of English... you try and try and still can't understand her and then u just give up and point to the menu like you're some drunken college student stopping off at Denny's before heading back to the dorm after a CRAZY night at the frat house!   She writes some stuff down and then after what feels like an eternity, she plops down a HUGE plate of whatever you ordered and all it's rubbery good-less. *shudders*  yup, aggravating.   You try and try and become convinced that something isn't right. You think, what IS that flavor?? Nana never made anything that tasted like THAT!! But alas, your efforts are in vain... that's the horrifying facts of this would be chain. It's 90% processed foods. It's not that good. And it's what I call \"safe\" Mexican food. and it's very tourist friendly, it IS right next to a resort! And for some strange reason, it makes the list of places to dine when hankering for \"authentic\" Mexican food.  Yup... aggravating."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation from a family member. Other locations may be better but this location was not worth another visit. It's not terrible but certainly not good either.   Specifically I had the enchiladas and they were very dry. There was very little cheese and saucy goodness. For a sit down place I definitely expected more.   The service was good but couldn't make up for the food. I would much rather go to a place like tortilla fish instead next time."}
{"text":"Go for happy hour drinks and nothing else. Food is terrible and service is nothing special."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Arizona Grand and had lunch here. The food was so bland-I have no idea how you can screw up a $14 chicken burrito. Plenty of beans of rice to fill your plate!"}
{"text":"Rude greeting. Manager a bit abrasive when informing us that it was a 30 min wait to be seated outside. Instead sat us at the \"kiddie room\" upfront. Filthy floors with crushed chips and food residue. Bus boy decided, in the middle of attempting to have a conversation, vacuumed the floor with a very loud 1972 big ole Hoover vacuum! Waited 10 mins just to order water and chips. Still no service! Nope had enough, I'm outta here! Terrible because it was my first time and I really wanted to try this place after driving 25 mins to go!"}
{"text":"What a joke. Just moved to the area and decided to stop here. My husband and I were seated all the way in the back right by the kitchen. Wouldn't have been a problem if they were busy, but they were not. In my opinion that is the worst spot in any restaurant. We weren't even given a view of the fountains that are outside.. Lighting was so dim I could barley see my menu (I'm in my 20's btw...) so we had to move. Our server (Lupe) was on the border of being disrespectful. She has no personality, disappeared for periods of time, didn't fill up my soda, etc. Food was okay but overpriced. When paying for our bill our server NEVER told us that their credit card machines were down. Instead she took our credit card number down manually with the machine. Might have been okay with that if she had of taken two seconds to tell us that was the way they were going to have to do it. I'm not okay with a server being able to copy down my credit card info. Ripped it up and paid cash. Once again zero personality from our server. I wouldn't ever go here again nor recommend that anyone does."}
{"text":"We use to live in OC California and our main mex food was Micasa in New Port Beach.  Micasa has changed hands in the last few years but had the best salsa and food.  So since moving to Phoenix 3mo. ago we've been looking for a Sonora style mex restaurant that was similar to Micasa.  The salsa comes in two bowls which we mix and love.  The food I'll say just one thing.  With all the mex restaurants Aunt Chilada's gives you large portions and the enchiladas actually are stuffed with meat.  So if your missing your Micasa fix this is really close."}
{"text":"The chicken in my enchilada was OK, food overall was average. Service was horrible. Marilyn did not get a tip last night because she was condescending and barely there. I do blame part of my bad experience here on the bellhop who dropped us off at a weird spot. We walked around not sure where to go for a couple minutes until I asked. Will not return."}
{"text":"This experience was terrible. Every single employee was rude from the moment we walked in. We waited forever for a table to get ready in an empty restaurant with plenty of tables already ready. We waited forever at our table before a server finally came over. We gave her all of our orders with drinks and we waited 25 minutes before we got our drinks. Chips salsa and apps came out before our drinks. The only reason this was 3 stars was because of the food. And then we realized why the service sucked when we got out bill, they apply auto gratuity at 20%! Won't be back and won't recommend. Not to be treated like that"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night at 6:15 and went into the lounge bar because it was a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table. The hostess indicated we could order food here. We sat for 20 minutes while several waitresses walked by us, served other tables, gave menus and got drinks for other people. When we finally asked the hostess for menus she said well we're very busy. After another 10 minutes with no service or acknowledgement we left."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I love Mexican but I won't be coming back here again. My refried beans were a dull grey color and were not spiced or even salted. I ordered a number two which is a bean burrito enchilada style with a beef tamale. The tamale was so dry I couldn't even finish it. Simply put, I don't recommend it. There are so many better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. Never again."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone who knows and understands authentic Mexican food can enjoy this food. We order the Chicken tortilla and chicken burro. Everything tasted like it came out of a can. The waitress was super nice and noticed I did not like the soup and she was sweet to take it off our bill. Burro had more juice than it needed to be. It was really salty but at the same time bland. I usually check Yelp first before I try something, but this was just spur of the moment. Never again. I would rather eat at Taco Bell and I don't even like them. End Rant."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Arizona Grand with some friends, and we didn't feel like paying the prices at the pool, so we ventured over to Aunt Chilada's assuming we could get some inexpensive Mexican grub. I managed to keep my meal cheap (one corn tamale, with green enchilada sauce, beans, greens, and rice was $9.95), but I was really surprised by the high prices.   There are so many GOOD Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, with a nicer, cleaner ambiance than Chilada's, so I don't understand the high prices, except that the restaurant sits on hotel property.   Service was fine -- our server wasn't particularly nice, but she often refilled our $3 icea teas, and food was brought out in a prompt manner. Food was OK  -- I'm not crazy for chunky salsa, so I avoided the chips and salsa, but my food was cooked adequately. The food was drowned in cheese though, which was off-putting."}
{"text":"Better food, cheaper pricing, at OTHER places. Unfortunately it's not the quality it was 15 yrs ago. Food was drowned in sauce, and bathrooms were truly authentic Mexico (and not in a good way; dirty & rundown). Service was just average. Pricing was very expensive for what u get."}
{"text":"To start off our evening the chips and salsa weren't very good; salsa had no spice at all.  I ordered the Ocho (#8), which was a chile relleno and a spinach enchilada with a jalapeño cream cheese sauce. The chile relleno was pretty good while the spinach enchilada was a little crispy and the spinach almost seemed partially frozen. The rice and beans were alright at best with the beans lacking much flavor. The Staff was friendly and service was pretty quick. We were surprised to have to wait 30 min to be seated at 8pm on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Tourists....  Would love this place. I supposed that is why it is within walking distance of the Arizona Grand Resort. As for me, a longtime local, I could easily pass on this place.  We asked to be seated on the patio in the shade. Turns out only half the table was covered and it was getting hot. We saw a bunch of umbrellas in the corner not be used and asked our server if we could have another umbrella to cover the two that were roasting in the sun. She got upset. She actually said no! My cousin decided to take matters into his own hands and get one. The server came flying over and told him that was against the rules. She is not allowed to take an umbrella from another servers section. Weird as there were not any patrons in the area. Her attitude sucked. She was very lucky that I was not deciding how much to tip.  The chips were OK and the salsa was actually good.  I had the chicken enchiladas, meh. The sauce had no flavor.  The best part was hand feeding the ducks on the patio.   The prices are outrageous for the caliber of food you receive.   Skip it. Go somewhere that serves real Mexican food and provides friendly service.   Next..."}
{"text":"What a disaster of a restaurant this place is. With sho so many great examples of good American American-style Mexican food in the surrounding environment of Phoenix Arizona, there's just no excuse. I had actually hoped that it might be authentic Mexican, but it couldn't be farther from that. I think the sole reason that this place exists is because of the nearby hotel. It would definitely fail in an environment where It did not have a captive audience. I guess the big bar seem to be an attraction also because there were a whole lot of drunk idiots wandering around. The chips were disgusting. The salsa was boring and flavorless. The enchiladas were loaded with so much poor quality cheese that I may as well have been eating a candle. What a regrettable experience overall. Go anywhere else if you have the chance."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant off/on for 20 years. My recent experience with this location is a below average experience. Our server was average. The #3 chicken taco and chicken enchilada was so-so. The restaurant hasn't been updated any time recently. I asked for the flour tortilla chips and they weren't that tasty and seemed very flat this time. The salsa, historically pretty good, was also below average. With all the solid Mexican restaurants in town, this location isn't bad, but it isn't great either."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve the right to call their food Mexican. There's absolutely nothing authentic about this restaurant. It was depressing"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, and a nice patio. I would go back in the future. This location is good for guests of the Arizona Grand Resort. You can walk or have a short drive to Aunt Chilada's. The salsa was really good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are Tucson natives. We moved here  2 years ago and have been on a search for the best margarita in the valley. This place is it!!! The bartender Tia was wonderful. She was very attentive and friendly! The food is pretty good and the guacamole is to die for! I'm Hispanic so it takes a lot for me to complement good Mexican food. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Staying at the amazing Arizona grand hotel and thought we should stroll over for a margarita and a bite to eat. We all ordered and got the nachos which were cold and the cheese was not melted which should have been an indicator...so we proceeded to order. Nothing was great but worse of all was my salad which was floating in dressing and the waitress just shook it off. She never checked on us and when she came to clear the table she never asked why the salad wasn't even touched. I'm not one to complain but the salad was uneatable. After this horrible experience my bill was $200. If your looking for good food this is the last place to go."}
{"text":"Service= 5 stars (Lupe, thank you)!  Patio seating= 5 stars (AZ weather, thank you)! Food = 3 stars, it was good but not great.  Table side guacamole was fresh but lacked \"flavor\" a bit more lime juice and a lot more cilantro would have made it lovely (who doesn't just love fresh avocado)?!  I had the beef taco and enchilada, my boyfriend ate most of it since he ordered the street tacos and was underwhelmed.  I do not like rice and beans so I cannot comment.  El Diablo margarita and Modelo Especial enjoyed :)"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Arizona Grand Resort for a conference and chose to dine at Aunt Chilada's for dinner one night. I sat outside which had a cool vibe.  Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but definitely good. I enjoyed my enchiladas and margarita.  Salsa and chips were good too! Overall, a relaxing dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill.  I had eaten here a few times and thought it was pretty good. Then we went for lunch and it was  incredibly busy one time we went for lunch with a 40 min wait so we decided to leave.   We went back a week or so later for dinner.  We had an incredibly long wait in the bar that seemed  to last forever even though there seemed to be plenty of tables on the patio.  They sat us inside in a very small room sandwiched in-between the kitchen and 3 large groups of very loud annoying people. There was only 2 of us not sure why were were relegated to such a terrible table.  Our food tasted terrible, oily, and the vegetables in my burrito were undercooked.  We didn't finish our dinner, paid and left. I have a pretty strong stomach, but both of us got extremely sick from the food after we left.   If you have to go here make sure you sit outside so you don;t get stuck in one the terrible side room."}
{"text":"Great Mexican Cuisine, chips and salsa are awesome, great portions at a fair price. Make sure to order some queso dip for your chips, and choose the Fideo as your side with entree. A must try when you are craving Mexican in Tempe."}
{"text":"They need to hire more staff and check more on tables.  They need more vegetarian selections.  The water in the glass (which I had to stand up and flag waiter for) was moldy tasting. Wash your dispensers!!!  Hire and train staff.  The food was pretty good, but salad cut in giant chunks."}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco de Mayo festivities. Great atmosphere, beautiful outdoor seating, delicious food & margaritas."}
{"text":"Food was actually not bad. But the service was terrible. I thought they were going to ask us to do our dishes and lock up. Don't let them put you in the back room... You'll never leave."}
{"text":"My first trip back in 6 years and it was pretty much the same! The food was still great along with the drinks! We sat out on the patio under an umbrella and it was perfect!! I don't however remember all the ducks from last visit but they add to the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Although we've eaten here several times over the past five years, we hadn't visited for awhile. I was a bit afraid to return after reading recent Yelp reviews. However, my husband and I were pleasantly pleased with the friendly and very efficient service. The restaurant was very busy with several special events, but we still received our food in about 15 minutes. Our waitress was genuinely friendly. The food was hot and fresh. I like non-fussy (OK, maybe bordering on Gringo?) Mexican food. I don't like too much cheese or too many onions or really hot sauces, so Aunt Chilada's was definitely my style. Portions were quite generous for the higher prices, so we came away full and satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Aunt Chilada's a few times.  I will finally write a review.  This place is good.  The service was great during this visit last week.  I did not care for the chips they brought out.  I ended up ordering two shredded beef tacos, rice and black beans.  The tacos were really good the meat had a good flavour.  The beans were good and the rice was good too.      There are so many varieties of Mexican food here it is crazy.  I liked this food at Aunt Chilada's, but it might not appeal to others.   Disclaimer I tend to like all styles of Mexican food.  My family made a lot of Spanish dishes and it is really different than Mexican dishes.  You can only eat so much chicken, shrimp, paella varieties and tortilla de patatas.  I loved eating at my friends house for dinner as a kid because the Mexican food was yummy."}
{"text":"I recently visited for happy hour and I will be back whenever I'm in the area! The happy hour prices can't be beat! $4 house margaritas were just right and big! The food prices vary depending on the hour. We just made it before 4pm so our food was only $3! At 4pm it goes up to $4 and at 5pm it goes up to $5 which is still an awesome deal! The enchiladas were great! It comes with 2 normal size enchiladas and a little salad garnish. We mixed a chicken and cheese and the sauce was super yummy! I grew up in Southern California so I know my Mexican food. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. I may have gotten one semi-stale chip out of the huge bowl I ate. We also had a cheese crisp (which they don't have in CA) and although those are always a little plain for me normally, that excellent salsa slathered on there made it AWESOME! The bartender was cool and chatted with us as did a woman at the bar eating alone and one of the regulars was also very friendly. The bar is small, however, so I almost hate to let the word get out on this hidden gem because you better make room for me when I come back. The outdoor patio looked super fun & colorful to hang out on when the weather cools down. I enjoyed the ambiance of the whole place! I had intended on trying a chili relleno but I was too full on the happy hour bargains. I asked the bartender if there was chicken in it like one reviewer said and he said no. Everything we had was so good that I have no doubts the rest of the food is good. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was alright.   The salsa was actually pretty amazing but that is where the amazing stops. I ordered a combo plate with a tostado, taco, and enchilada. It arrived super soggy and not appetizing at all. The beans and rice were ok.   The kids meals were just that. Kids meals.   The winner of the night surprisingly was my sons plain nachos. Yep, they managed to get chips with melted cheese right.  The sopapillas were not good at all.   Probably best to skip this joint really."}
{"text":"Came to eat after hiking (around 11a)- was not busy. Seated quickly. Service was quick and friendly. Sat outside (it's March, so weather is perfect!) And enjoyed the patio.  Ordered steak and chicken fajitas- were perfect!  Still sizzling on the skillet, lots of meat & veggies!  Taste was great!  Beans & fideo were good too!    Love the chips & salsa too!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that if I could give this place a 0 star I would..  Aunt Chilada's, I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a very very long time & when I decided to take my family here for a birthday gathering it all went way down south & I can thank the staff here for it. Tonight I had my family 11 people including 4 children come here for dinner 9-13-14 around 5 o'clock..  My family had decorated the table with birthday items and we were in a secluded corner it looked like they had set up for large parties, from what I believe we were the only people in this side of the section of the restaurant. After about 10 mins of the kids laughing and the adults talking and the birthday squeakers going this place was ready to kick us out..  After we had ordered our server told us to stop being loud & for us to stop using the birthday favors. We said okay and had taken them from the kids.. Then adults were still talking amongst each other and a \"non-friendly\" \"extremely rude\" charge/supervisor/manager named Lindsay comes over with some other people and asked to talk to my mom who made the arrangements in the corner, I for one felt very offended by this. She is extremely rude to my mom and basically tells us if we don't shut up and stop bothering other people that we were going to be kicked out..  Mom: Are you asking us that we should leave?\" Lindsay: Yes, yes I'm wanting you to get out of our establishment.\"   I'm not quite sure if those are her exact words but yes she said \"GET OUT\" Who in the customer service business says \" GET OUT\" to a customer. YOU DON'T SAY THAT... HORRIBLE.  Who in the hell do you think you are to talk to my mother like that you pathetic piece of a \"customer service\" supervisor?!  She leaves with her little \"helpers\" and we sit down, my mom is beyond stressed out by this utmost disrespect. We are gathering our things to leave..  THEN we get it a third time right after Lindsey leaves!!  This idiot guy with some \"professional\" business clothes comes over to our table with security from the damn resort next door!  He starts telling us that we are being loud and blah blah blah.. I tell him \" Sir, you and your charges/supervisors have come over multiple times to tell us the same thing, we have stopped being loud & using the party favors quite a while ago & you keep coming over and interrogating us constantly we get it we have stopped\"   Manager: \"Okay, okay.. um thanks..   Now you have really pissed me off, I now feel offended because you are attacking me in front of my children. One of my children has a \"developmental delay\" he does not understand why you are being this way to us..   My husband stands up and says \"why don't we just leave, they are probably going to just spit in our food anyways\" yeah why dont we just go..  We stand up and start packing our things, what a horrible birthday dinner this has turned out to be. I have had bad service but to be attacking your customers because they are being \"loud\" is no excuse, they could have asked us kindly to be quiet but no, they would rather lose out on 200+ dollars of our money.   The only thing good that came out of this is that they excused our couple fountain drinks and iced teas that we did order.   Oh, and another thing the salsa tastes like crap, it was cold and tasted like something I would buy off the counter in the store for example: pace..  What a bad restaurant, don't go here, there are plenty of other good Mexican food restaurants around that are more enjoyable than this place.."}
{"text":"Decided to meet a friend here for lunch since I've heard good things about the place. Being owned by the resort i expected more on far as looks, but food was great. They should really do something about the flooding. Not only did we have to walk through it to get to the front but the poor workers had to be walking all through that getting their feet all wet. I know I would hate to work through that."}
{"text":"Yuck. Just yuck. Bland. Left most of it there as did every table around us. The Don Julio margarita was watery and tasteless so my husband exchanged it for a bloody mary (also bland).  Not only did the charge us for both drinks they charged us double!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because we love the Scottsdale location. Unfortunately this location pales in comparison. Our service was slow and the food was only ok. We won't be going back"}
{"text":"Outdated decor and average, slightly overpriced food. OK, I could end the review right there, but I shall elaborate a bit further.  Seems like Aunt Chiladas has seen some better days. It looks like a water park for midgets outside, when you approach the entrance. Very cool... For 1974.  It's a very colorful place, but seems as though it hasn't changed since the aforementioned year. Just guessing there. Menu items are all priced about 3 dollars to high. Glad I went once, probably won't re-visit."}
{"text":"How the heck does this place have a 2 star rating?!  Has anyone even TRIED that queso dip?  Um...HELLO. It's kind of amazing...y'all need more margaritas in your life.  Granted, I came here for a work catered private party so everything was set up super nicely for us and was wonderful. We had an open bar serving bomb af margaritas all night so it's really hard to complain about this place; everything tastes better when it's free and you're drunk off free booze (let's be honest).  Oh, and that flourless chocolate cake? Definitely wanted to eat like 100 slices of that. Creamy af."}
{"text":"My wife and I returned to Aunt Chilada's during our 1-year anniversary stay at Arizona Grand Resort.  We held our rehearsal dinner and 150 person meet and greet at Aunt Chilada's in 2015.  We came in and were greeted by Sam (manager) who was instrumental in executing our big wedding event.  We had a great chat with Sam, and she showed us some excellent hospitality.  We enjoyed fajitas and margaritas at the bar.  Jeff (bartender) took excellent care of us.    We have only had positive experiences at Aunt Chilada's.  To top it off, Sam has done an excellent job expanding the tequila list.  Try the Casa Noble and Espolon Anejo Bourbon Cask!"}
{"text":"This places was hands down amazing for family, happy hour, or large groups!! Service is awesome and you must try the Molchajete Bowl!! Thanks Brian for an AMAZING experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is what I call a \"tourist\" mexican restaurant, although the chips are good, there is not much else I would recommend.  I came with a group otherwise I would not normally come here.  Service was great considering we were like 20 people."}
{"text":"Met my Mom in Tempe and had a wonderful early dinner. Ashley our server was so accomidating and brought some water for my service dog! Tia was our bartender and mixed up some tasty margaritas. We will for sure be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Tried out the happy hour at about 4pm on a weekday and place was empty. The bar is small inside and there is no bar outside. They have decent drink prices as I scored a domestic draft for 2 bucks. They have a bunch of food choices as well for between $3 and $5 depending on the time. It was a bit of surprise that they do not offer white meat chicken for the tacos, only mixed. That tells me that this place is saving money and I'm not buying the bartenders \"it keeps it moist excuse\" Menu prices are right out of Scottsdale, but the free chips and salsa were good. Chips were kinda warm and salsa was chunky variety with some onions floating in the bowl. Too small of a bar area for a good happy hour crowd, so this place won't need to be revisited."}
{"text":"What a mess!  Showed up here on a Thursday night starving to see a line practically out the door. As we were waiting to get a table people a few ahead of us were told that they were closing. We looked at our watches and it was about 10 until 9 and they said they closed at 9. You might want to close when you say and not earlier because it almost caused a riot.   We decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for the bottom to fall out of the mess at the front. Sat down and the bartender was pretty quick and really personable. He was the best part about this whole place.   First let me say that this place is terrible. I went to their website and it was voted 'Best of' for several things that were totally NOT best of anything. Worst of, yes. Best of, stop using that phrase with this restaurant. Does not go.  First up was chips and salsa. The salsa really was actually right on. It was fresh and had a nice kick to it, but the chips? They must of run out of their 'best of' chips because these tasted like stale Tostitos. Oh man, stale Tostitos would have been an improvement, actually.   We then ordered the spicy queso bean dip and instantly regretted it. It was so bland and so un-queso-y that we pushed it away and waited for our entrees.   I ordered vegetable fajitas which you THINK you couldn't mess up. Oh, guess what? Yeah. My friend ordered some shrimp dish that I refused to try so I'm not sure if it was good or not.   I wouldn't eat here again unless the world was wiped out by an atomic bomb and only because the food here would survive."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Arizona Grand Resort and decided to give this a try!   Good margs and atmosphere.   Food was rather expensive for what it was but we are from Texas and have a bajillion Tex-mex places, this is not Chuys if you're looking for that."}
{"text":"We had our first dinner here, it was great. We kept asking ourselves why we had never tried it before. I had the tacos (chicken and shredded beef) they were great! He had the burrito, it was also great. We asked for a hotter salsa and they brought it out. Our server Marcia was great as well! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good. Great place to hang out with friends, chow down on chips and salsa, and drink a few drinks. Overall, the food and service was average."}
{"text":"First off the menu is crap and very limited and for the price, you might as well get Taco Bell. The service was horrible the waitress did not come to check on us until She provided the bill. I just don't see the point in paying a decent amount of money on such shit food"}
{"text":"One word: Exquisite.  We were quickly seated outside and ordered drinks, all of which were amazing. Our appitizers were incredible (we got queso), but our entrees really knocked it out of the park. Everything was sizzling and seasoned to perfection. Would definateley go again"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner, after having a great dinner at another Aunt Chilada's a few years ago. The hostess told us it would be 15-20 minutes, but we could be seated inside now. I said sure, and the hostess had the waitress take us to a table in the back in a dark corner, and at the time there were only a few table seated at the time. I asked her \" if we could sit at a small table up front\", which the waitress took the table. She comes back with the menus, and says, \"hi, I am back\". We give her our drink order, and our food order. She gave the kitchen the wrong number for my combo dinner, so I had to send it back. The waitress returns with the  correct combo for me, and says\" you got direct from the oven, so at least it is hot\". We finished our food, and working on our drinks after the waitress had taken our empty plates. She had come through the room 2 more times, and never looked in our direction, or came over to ask us if we were ready for our check. I had to call her as she was leaving the next table over for our check. We got our check, and she had billed us for the extra dinner that she had written down wrong, and given the kitchen. At that time asked for the Manager due to the poor service, and expressed our displeasure with the service. The manager informed us that this location was owned by the resort, and not affiliated with the other Aunt Chilada's. The manager asked us if we got good service from a name, which turned out to be the waitresses name, whom she had never introduced her self. I had to ask the manager who that was. When I told the manager that we didn't get good service, she left our table, telling us that she will take care of our check."}
{"text":"I adore this Mexican food place.  The food is enjoyable, and always consistent.  The Pollo Fondito is my favorite. Just the right amount of spice and LOTS AND LOTS of cheese.  The wait staff is kind, and friendly.   The drinks are amazing. I love all of their margaritas. (those that I have tried anyways LOL)   But my favorite part about this location is the building. Everything is so colorful and campy, and just beautiful. My husband thinks it's tacky, but I just adore it.   I had a friend who was married here years ago, and it's just a beautiful location."}
{"text":"Staying at the Arizona Grand for a meeting we chose to eat here for lunch one day.  The food was good.  I had the fish tacos which were pretty tasty, not the best I've had but fine.  The service was great.  The outside seating was nice.  I can't complain.  A little pricey but being on a resort that was pretty much expected."}
{"text":"Food was good!  We did an early dinner while at the Arizona Grand to avoid crowds and get back to more swimming.  Hostess was super nice and food was very filling.  Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my office. I eat here maybe once a month. The food is good and consistent. It's not great Mexican food but it's better than some. My only reason for less stars is due to the higher prices they now charge. The food just isn't worth the higher costs to get more stars."}
{"text":"One hour wait at 5pm on a Wednesday night. Surely you can't be serious?!? And don't call me Shirley!!!  Bait and switch on happy hour, what eves!!! We bailed and went to an amazing Thai Restaurant off the reservation"}
{"text":"Average Mexican. You might expect better for a Mexican restaurant in Arizona, but if you are at the Arizona Grande it's convenient."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for literally decades and enjoying it and, in fact, when I was there in March, it was a really good experience.  My husband and I ate here last night however, and I will NEVER, EVER go back.  Where to start... Wow.  The server was obviously very agitated because she had too many tables and it was awful, terrible, horrible service.  The Mexican shrimp cocktail, which I loved 4 months ago, was so on-fire spicy that I couldn't eat it (I *love* spicy food, not a wimp at ALL).  Almost everything was heavily over-spiced, whether it was too hot, too salty, etc.  We literally left about 85% of our food uneaten and the server didn't ever even check with us to see if the food was OK or if we needed anything.  She picked up the full dishes without even asking if anything was wrong.    Ugh.  I could go on with a huge list of what was awful about this experience but I guess saying that the food was awful, the service was awful, and the ambiance was awful probably says it all.  I know that the Arizona Grand resort owns this location now (not sure how long that has been the case), and I don't know if that's what happened here but I will definitely never be back."}
{"text":"My food was good, I had fish tacos. No complaints. My server, Lucas M. was really really good, just making sure to get us everything we needed, six of us in our party. I felt like he wanted my meal and visit to be very pleasant, and it was."}
{"text":"We had a meeting in the area and the seven of us decided to hit Aunt Chilada's for a late lunch. It was convenient but that's about all.  The service was friendly and quick enough, but the selections were completely overpriced. I ended up requesting just an appetizer just to keep within my lunch budget.  The lemonade was bad. As in made with turned lemons and not sweet at all. And if they didn't make it, they need to clean the fountain machine or something.  I got a shredded beef quesadilla and it was so greasy I had to tip my plate to keep the remainder from swimming while I tried to eat. It tasted good once I squeezed out the drippings from each piece. I wasn't impressed.  But what annoyed me the most was although they automatically added a 20% tip onto every ticket, when the server brought back my change from a $20, she kept the extra 83 cents. Rounding up quite a bit there, eh? $2.73 tip for a crappy $9.50 appetizer is asking too much.  Next time someone suggests this place, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Well I would recommend not eating there, drink are great. My enchiladas were cold, the cheese wasn't melted, the fish tacos weren't good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and ambience is what makes it enjoyable. Traditional Mexican/American food, nothing to brag about except that it beats anything at the mall! The guacamole tostada is one of my favorites. If weather permits definitely worth eating outside."}
{"text":"In town for Spring Training, found this on our last day.  Wish we found it sooner!  Large portions, very fresh.  Five stars in my book, looks like a great happy hour place!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner. It had been a very long time since I had been here before. A few months ago we went to the one at Dreamy Draw in Phoenix. I do not think they are connected anymore.  lots of parking in the lot. I guess they do not have the great happy hour deals the other one does. We were seated right away, but had to wait a bit for a server. Even though there was only 2 other tables in there at the time.  Anyway our server was nice. She refilled our drinks at just the right time, in fact gave us fresh glasses each time.   Our food was good though not very spicy. It was very average Mexican food. I have to say I like Macayo's much better. We were given chips and Salsa, the chips were nice, warm and fresh, but the salsa was chunky and again not very spicy.   I think they cater more to the Hotel patrons now.  It is decorated very generic,like a quick salp of paint and some cheap artwork. I remember it much different the last time I was here. All in all it was good ,just not great. I do not think we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a nice patio.  Went here for a work happy hour - it's been a LOT of years since I was at this location. It's similar to the one at Squaw Peak - but not quite as much charm. (Likely due to lack of age of the building.)  Service was solid, food was acceptable gringo-Mex, and the people with mixed drinks seemed to like them. (As long as the Negro Modelo is cold and the glass around the lip of the bottle isn't chipped, it's on par with every other one I've ever had, so I really can't judge the drinks.)  I would never choose this place based on food alone - but when you have a group and the weather is patio-rific, if's not a bad choice at all!"}
{"text":"I have been to Aunt Chilada's a few times in my Arizona days.   The most memorable, however, was when one of my friends and I pulled a Little Mermaid and combed our hair with plastic forks before dining here. and i believe we combed our hair with a fork shortly after making a hillbilly joke. ironic :) I don't remember why we looked so horrible but we obviously thought it was bad enough to need to comb our hair with a fork.    anyway, the food here has never been memorable or terrible. more like a 'i won't complain if you let me sit on the patio and drink margaritas'   it is definitely a 'meh' experience, but not gross....and probably the best mexican restaurant option if you're in that area. so for that, i am giving it 1 extra star."}
{"text":"I love this place.  One of my favorites in the valley... the service is great and the food is sooooo good.  Not sure if they changed the salsa recipe, but if they did....would prefer the original one to the one they are serving now....  If you sit on the patio, ask for Jen as your server...she is friendly, and great, we try to get her section every time we go there......awesome place to dine outside during the fall,,,,,  Please go back to the original salsa!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few time, this was the first time we were sat in the dinning room on the other side of the patio. It was very nice, quite and good air conditioning. Three of us in our party this trip. Our waiter was Ryan B., good service, not very chatty but attentive. We started with chip & salsa and a few San Tan Hopshock's. For dinner: Chili Relleno: Stuffed with Jack cheese W/rice & black beans Carne con Chile burrito deep fried W/ refried beans & rice Beef burrito deep fried W/ refried beans & rice  All the food was hot and tasted great."}
{"text":"Too expensive for nasty Mexican food .  This place sucks.  I cut into my beef burrito and a whole buch of water came out.  My girlfriend had the chicken burrito and water came out too.  Why are sodas $3.00 dollars?  We ate here because we stayed at Arizona grant resort.  They suck too.   Will not eat here again even if its free."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of state and had lunch here. I had chicken enchiladas. The combo of the chicken and the enchilada sauce tasted like it had been sprinkled with unicorn dust. What made these enchiladas so good? Please tell me. We were leaving town the next day so we had to have dinner there again that night before we had to kiss the best restaurant enchiladas I ever tasted goodbye. Salsa was very fresh and taste bud friendly. Don't base your decision to patronize on people's reviews that admit to having good experiences here but only write a review after one \"bad\" visit."}
{"text":"This was the first time we had eaten at this restaurant, and have to say - we are SO glad we did.  There were 3 of us, and I got my usual dish I get at most mexican restaurants, enchiladas.  I had 1 shredded beef, and 1 shredded chicken - and they had probably the best flavor I have had since being in Puerto Vallarta.  The service was great, and the atmosphere is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fajitas to go and the staff was amazing. The chicken pieces were big and very tender, juicy and well seasoned along with the onions and peppers. Meal came with a huge bag of chips and a hearty serving of salsa. Definitely a must go to. Authentic Mexican food, amazing atmosphere and a very welcoming staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant was busy and I am so glad we decided to wait for a table! The food was amazing. The wait staff was attentive, friendly, and funny. The drinks were good. We even had ducks out on the patio with us! Will definitely return when I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Do you want delicious Mexican food with great service at an affordable price? Then this shit hole is not for you! We waited an hour and a half for food without any apology from our clueless classless waitress. When we asked what was going on, she said the kitchen had \"a big ticket ahead of us still\" and walked away. It even took 30+ minutes for us to get a drink. Total joke. But what does our idiot waitress care? They built in a 20% tip to our already expensive bill! Pass on this dump at ALL costs...you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I grew up around here... before there was the Pointe at South Mountain and any of the office suites that line baseline road there was orange groves and nestled within were cool old houses along with a Mexican restaurant called Juan Tanamera's.  In fact my dad's friend built his house there and I have pictures from the 70's of my dad helping to build this house.  My dad would bring my sister and I here for dinner often... the food was great and we always had a great time.  Once the Pointe was built they bought the Mexican restaurant and named it Aunt Chilada's.  Everything changed... the menu was different, the staff was different.  The only thing that remained the same was the structure of the building and the cool ponds that surrounded it which no longer have coy but sometimes an occasional duck.  I agree with the other reviewers of this place that the service is lack luster and the food is OK.  There is one thing I like here and that is the albondigas soup... small bite sized meatballs with veggies and a savory broth; they also put fideo noodles in it which makes it even better.  I do crave this soup and since it is very close to my work i often call in an order of it.  Every time I walk in to pick it up it always brings up fond memories from the past."}
{"text":"Service was incredible, our server Marcia was all over drink refills and extra chips and salsa. She recommended the fajitas and they were superb, not cheap on the chicken and steak, the tortillas were warm and fresh, atmosphere is very laid back. Best Fajita's in town!!"}
{"text":"Oh Dear Aunt Chilada, where did you go?  When I was young we would go out to eat on very special occasions.  I remember the excitement of going to Aunt Chilada's for birthday dinners and having a great time.    I'm not sure if it's the childhood memories not holding up, or the change in management, but Aunt Chilada's truly disappointed me.  We went with a part of four, and I was the only person who had been there before.  The interior and décor was EXACTLY as I remembered it, meaning that in 15 years, I don't think they've even touched up the paint.  Once seated, we found that the room was very noisy, with only 3 parties in the room.  It was also extremely crowded, with tables much closer than they needed to be.  The service was adequate, other than sitting dry waiting for more drinks.  They did bring chips and salsa quickly, and the staff was polite.  Now, to the part that was so heartbreaking for me.  The food.  Meh about sums up what I thought.  I tried a little off of everyone's plate, and across the board it was so-so.  Nothing inspired me, nothing stood out.  While it's still better than Taco Bell, it really seemed like they were phoning it in.  There was no symphony of flavors, nothing unexpected.   All in all, this is a good place to take your East Coast relatives who can't handle spice, for a stereotypical Mexican meal.  It's kind of like the Disney version of Mexico.  For natives like myself, especially those who either cook their own food, or love a little spice and excitement, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Food was ok maybe would have been better if I could actually eat it instead of swating all the flies away"}
{"text":"Expensive bland very Americanized Mexican food. Probably good for tourist who like mile Pace salsa FRM the grocery store. Probably what bothered me the most was all the rescued on expenses fur adding things like green chiles $1 onions $1 cheese $1.75. Our iced tea was $3. Not to of this works prices but kinda high. Service was ok, they got us what we asked for but without a smile or any enthusiasm. Beautiful location though!"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly, but found service to be slow, all around, receiving drinks, ordering dinner, and eventually receiving our meals. Time from arrival to food was 45 minutes. Chips were good, and chunky salsa had an enjoyable flavor. I ordered steak fajitas, and found that they were tender, but had a very off taste, similar to a dirty grill possibly. Off taste was more noticeable as meal went on resulting in eating less than one third of the entree before deciding I was better off avoiding it. Bill was dropped on table shortly after, no discussion of food quality, offer of drink refills, or other standard practices. This location is not related to another restaurant bearing the same name in Phoenix. Slow service and off tasting food resulted in the low rating."}
{"text":"See my tip;) family friendly, good service, American Mexican food. Large portions. Enjoyed the tacos and sangria Rita. No problems."}
{"text":"Food was good and so were the drinks. The problem was getting them. Bar tenders were really bad, and the bar is only bout 8 foot long. If it is busy expect to be ignored for at least 15 minutes. Order drinks and food together, it will take a while to see her again. Happened all 3 times I went. Like another review said typical resort restaurant."}
{"text":"Always like the atmosphere. The water going in, the patio is really a great place to take family members when they are down on vacation. Service is usually good, some servers are better then others the two veteran ladies are awesome if you get them. They are knowledgeable and give A service the new ones could learn from them. Food is good and they have a nice tequila selection."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch at Aunt Chiladas! Great food, exceptional service and Ashley's table side guacamole was amazing!!! Thanks Ashley!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere outside. Prompt, courteous service and fantastic food and drinks.I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best service by EVERYONE (hostesses, bartender, and server)! This is refreshing. The people eating here are even awesome! Best energy and vibe I have had in a long time. Gloria is an amazing server! Lover her! Food a little dry but honestly don't care - that's how welcoming and great these people are....I can deal with a Lil dryness in the food....just not In The people :)  Will be back."}
{"text":"Now that's some great Mexican food! I went with a group to Aunt Chilada's this past weekend and everyone had a great time. Made reservations which is always key because the place was packed and we were seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and the margaritas started flowing! Food came and it was hot and the portions were large, I felt like I was at a Italian restaurant. Overall we had a great time and the staff was friendly and really went the extra mile ensuring a great evening.   PS. Make sure to order the \"hot\" salsa and Cheese crisp for an appetizer. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We live in the valley. Mexican food is everywhere.  This place is way over priced for Mexican food.  In the past I would have given 3 stars over priced Mexican food that was ok, nothing special, but okay.  After eating here on Tuesday I will never return.  The beef chimi made me very sick, a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I dont want to give Auntie even a one star.. On a beautiful Saturday, my friends  wanted to go sit and have something to drink & have an app , or two. This is tops for happy hour places, that's why we chose it. We opted to sit at the bar outside.. All the tables were reserved for a shower. Every time we were spoken to.. bc no one manned the bar.. it was rudely. We got a cerveza and a marg.. at least those you cant really fail on. The salsa was horrid...& I usually love the Aunts salsa.. we ordered sopapillas.. asked to have them first.. Umm guess not.. THEY never arrived.. Our water ran empty.. our chips and not-so-much salsa ran out... THE end was when our nachos.. had a hair on top.. we told the curt waitress.. & she rolled her eyes and said sorry.. We never saw her again.. THE thing is.. I usually LOVE this place for it's patio and good food , but tonight .. .. I DONT think SO! I left with my appetite ruined."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the price was right, but a bit on the higher end. Went for a work luncheon and was quite satisfied with my burrito. During the spring time the outdoor seating is wonderful (but only under the treasurer because it's cooler)."}
{"text":"Very authentic tasting food. Very generous portions. Service was friendly and environment was authentic. Nachos appetizer was a meal in itself. Very good. I'd recommend this place when you're in the area. Has a gluten free menu too!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and very nice servers and bartenders.  Margaritas are also very good.  Little on the expensive side and no lunch menu only a happy hour menu from 3-6 but this place is also a part of a top notch resort so I expected it to be a little pricey."}
{"text":"I came in with my fiance last week for lunch. He is not a fan of Mexican food but the ambiance was great. Our server Jenny went above and beyond and suggested the Pollo Fundido. He loved it! She was very attentive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten here for lunch, let alone eating here for dinner.  Therefore, since we were in the Tempe area attending a symposium, and had to stop by Fry's Electronics; we decided to give this place a try since it was just across Baseline Road, and it was already past 9PM.  The entrance, the bridge over the mini pond, the patio, and the overall exterior appearance was just very inviting. We were encouraged that this may turn out to be a good spontaneous choice for this evening late dinner.  When we entered, the hostess greeted us and notified us that there would be a 15-20 minute wait. Although there were plenty of available tables as it was later in the evening, and the place wasn't really that busy; we chalked it up to just standard operating procedure in preparation prior to guests being seated.  It didn't really take that long for them to buzz us, and guide us to our seats. The hostess provided us with two menus, and then the adventure began.  When we started perusing the two page menu, it appears that whomever used these last had poured remnants of salsa and minute pieces of chips onto this menu, as it was all over the backside of both mine and my wife's. We had to quickly grab and use the napkins we had to clean ourselves up from the annoying mess. We flagged down our server, Marcia, and she graciously apologized, and quickly gathered up cleaner menus.  Upon returning, she informed us that she would get us chips and salsa (we could've eaten the ones that were on the menus, but that would be gross and there wasn't enough of it anyway =) ).  However, she got busy, and in passing, she informed us that one of the other servers would do so. That did not happen, and when she realized that we still hadn't gotten what she promised us, she went ahead and took care of it and took our order.  Now, here's the quandary with this place at night. I am a firm believer in romantic candle lit dinner places, as long as there is enough ambient light from \"somewhere\" (including a well lit candle) so as to be able to read the menu. Such was not the case here. It was dimly lit in certain areas that I had to use my cell phone's flashlight app to provide enough lighting so that we could read our menus and know what to order.   Now, if you think that this was an anomaly, and we were just being particular about this. The 3 separate groups of new arrivals on the other side of the room did the same exact thing as we did. The gentlemen who sat alone across from us had to walk across the room to get enough lighting to read his bill. And Marcia, our server, had pull out her phone to light up ours and other guests' bills to verify the total. Not sure what is going on here, but a little bit more spot lighting in certain places would go a long way to solving this minor annoyance. In any case, this is the reason why I have no pictures as I ran down my phone's battery to light up the menu.  I had the shredded beef burro (enchilada style), and a shredded beef taco. My wife had the Chimichanga.   The flavor wasn't bad, but we've had better. However, after a long day of sparse sustenance, we were famished enough that we were able to consume our meails.  I had the flan for dessert. It was too sweet for my taste, and it didn't have enough caramel on top. It tasted like it was pre-packaged.  All in all, it was a mediocre experience that didn't start out well, but ended on a slightly higher note which is why this review is 3 stars, and not 2 - especially with the miscue on the salsa filled menus. Someone should really be checking these before handing them out to guests. I thought that is what the hostesses were supposed to do. Perhaps, I am mistaken.  Marcia, our server, was just very efficient and she managed to recover what could've been a disastrous experience for us.  In any case, it was a beautiful night, and had beautiful company; so I never did mind too much the missteps of this place."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and attentive. Food was served quickly and was great. Recommend the creamy jalepeno sauce on the chimichanga!"}
{"text":"I do not know why this  place got so many low ratings. Decent mexican food and nice service. The margaritas are wonderful. The decor is cheeky cute!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually complain and you can see that on my review history but this place offers terrible terrible service, slow service (they weren't busy) and overpriced food and drinks. Wasn't impressed w/ the food and for sure will never return."}
{"text":"Hate doing this but for a 13$ margarita after tip I had to. I came in for a Cadillac margarita with hornitos and grand marnier like I did last week. I got a different glass and a different liquor. I asked if it had grand manier, since I seen what looked like a citrus patron bottle on the counter. She said they were out of grand marnier! How Do you run out of grand marnier at a Mexican restaurant?  I seen three bottles of grand marnier sitting on the shelf a foot away from me."}
{"text":"Bland and tasteless except the Talapia which tasted like olives and was sent back. The service was slow and inattentive. The only redeeming quality was the chips. While they were fresh and hot, the salsa was not. Even with extra heat requested, the salsa was bland. This is definitely not a Mexican restaurant any Mexican would be caught dead patronizing. It is definitely a place for gringos with no taste or high expectations."}
{"text":"Passable.  Good for big groups.  The queso is better than the chips and salsa.  The various menu items *sound* incredible, and what I've had wasn't bad by any means, but not particularly memorable either.  Extremely convenient if you're staying at the hotel next door though, definitely worth it in that case."}
{"text":"The salsa is good and the service is genuine. The food, however, isn't the best. My enchilada and chile relleno were quite tasty but the rice and fideo were not good. They were burnt and crispy...not a good kind of crispy! The tinga tacos were tasty but that's about it, taco-wise, because the other taco types didn't have much flavor at all...to the point that my husband couldn't even finish them. The margaritas are on point, though! This might me more the type of place where you have a few drinks and that's about it."}
{"text":"Grandma used to semi toast the tortillas for our tacos in Guatemala. Never have I found a place that does that.  Thank you aunt enchiladas for giving me a ratatoui moment. Bringing me back to my country. The staff is not only top notch but Marcia made an effort to talk in Spanish with no accent at all. It was beautiful.   I think I will come back several times, specially when I get homesick."}
{"text":"I first went to this restaurant over 20 years ago, might have been soon after it opened.  We had wonderful food that first time.  I still remember having the carnitas (pork) burro.  We went a second time a month or so later and the deterioration had already set in.  I ordered the same burro and it was very dry.  About a year later I took relatives there and again tried the carnitas burro and it was again dry and uninspired.  No one else raved about their food but things overall were still average.   Now to the recent experience... Over the past 3 months group of people and myself wanted to meet and talk at a restaurant so THEY choose ACs on two occasions.  I was hoping for a good experience but it was even worse than my last one  years ago.  On both occasions the service was quite slow.  On the second visit the server literally said, you should order now cuz you probably won't see me again soon and see was in a hurry to get the orders and get out.  I suspect the owners purposely understaff.  I would have again ordered carnitas but they no longer offer it except with a very high priced combo meal. So I ordered my other go to choice, a Green Burro, for both these visits.  Both times it was no better than average and overpriced.    The chips and salsa are also just average.  As another reviewer mentioned, the salsa tastes like they cut it with canned tomato sauce, it's soupy and has no bit whatsoever.   I don't know how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"We lived in Phoenix in the 1980s-1990s, moved away, and now are back.   Aunt Chilada's was one of our favorites then and were eager to return.   I was not disappointed!   We were there after the lunch rush on a Friday afternoon and got top-notch service and happy hour specials.   The food was very delicious.   I ordered then tamale and it was so much larger than what I'm used to.   The rice was perfect and the received beans were smoky. The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty.   I recommend sitting outside if the weather permits.   It had great ambiance with all the plants and ponds."}
{"text":"There were some pro's about this place: Service was decent and some of the food was really good. However, other food was just meh. The items that were good: Salsa had lots of onions in it which made me happy (I am a big onion lover!) and had a really good fresh flavor, the chips were nice and crisp, the jalapeno cream sauce that came with my numero ocho (8) combo was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and the fideo that the hubby ordered was different but I really enjoyed it (hubby said it was too plain for him). Now onto the other food: Hubby said his pork chimichanga wasn't bad and that the pork was cooked well but needed more seasoning, my chili relleno was ok but the batter had a weird texture to it, and my spinach enchilada was not very good at all. I like to have other components inside the enchilada rather then just plain spinach and unfortunately, these just had lumps of unflavored spinach with nothing else. So all in all, I would say this place was ok. There were some items that are good enough for me to come back but I would just try something else on the next visit."}
{"text":"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code.   Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called \"fandito.\" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.   I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad."}
{"text":"We are from Colorado. The ambiance was the first thing that grabbed our attention. The cute path to the restaurant patio was a great start. The weather was perfection. We loved the outdoor tables and chairs were comfortable. We had 2 rounds of house margs and both were outstanding. We got chips and 2 kinds of salsa, one spicier which my hubby liked. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had a steak dish with cheese enchilada. Hubby had a crazy big bowl filled with chicken, steak, and jumbo shrimp. He LOVED it! We really enjoyed our experience and are so glad we gave this place a try!"}
{"text":"We went here thinking the food would be the same as one at the Squaw Peak Pointe. It's not. Different owners I found out when I was there. The food was horrible. Honesty, I would have enjoyed Taco Bell more. There was nothing authentic about the Mexican food served here. It tasted like it came out of a can. The other Aunt Chilada's is far superior. Go there."}
{"text":"Best advice I can give, ask for the flour chips instead of corn, it'll change your life! Cute restaurant with a lot of personality located right off the resort on Baseline near Arizona Mills mall and the I-10. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating for any preference and party size. The food is typical American-Mexican with lots of cheese (not a bad thing) but, a bit overpriced in my opinion- I think that stems from being so close to a hotel. The service is just ok, not spectacular, so be prepared to wait a bit for a refill. I'd recommend the steak fajitas ($17) and the table side guacamole ($12)."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING menu, atmosphere and service! It felt like dining in Old Town San Diego.  And this is the first time I found healthy menu items on a Mexican restaurant menu, if fact there were many! Will return again and again! Located right off I-10 & Baseline."}
{"text":"The spicy salsa that you get when you sit down is great.  The queso dip - not spot much, it was cold and firm.  The table side guacamole was also good, the enchilada with jalepeno sauce on top - not that good.  The margarita was pretty good.  The service was spot on and we gave a good tip.  I am sure this place could be better but it did serve the purpose of not having to leave the resort property to have that \"dining out\" experience."}
{"text":"Food was pretty okay.  Good rice and beans. Service was lacking.  Took her almost 10 minutes to get to us the first time and she wasn't very pleasant.  If you can't handle a 6 table section (1 of the tables had 1 person 4 of them had 2 people and pretty sure one had already paid, plus our 3 people and then a table of 4), you shouldn't get one.  Thought some of the prices were a tad high for MExican food but it is at a resort.  Not sure if would go back just because of the service."}
{"text":"Upon arrival you give them your text number and you receive a text when your table is ready. Friday at noon, we only waited 10 minutes. First time here. Great waitress, very helpful. Food was great. I didn't think it was very pricey. I would go again. We ordered guacamole with the chips/salsa they brought. Daily special was good. Parking is plentiful. Right off I-10."}
{"text":"What a great place! We went with a party of 9 tonight and had the best service. Chips and salsa were out quickly and the margaritas were on par. My favorite part of the meal were the fish tacos. They are amazing! The sauce on the tacos was delicious! Thanks for the great service and food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful and described multiple dishes to us.  Her recommendations were wonderful.  The food was plentiful and great."}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor patio and the best Mahi Mahi street tacos I've ever had! I mixed the hot salsa with the mild for a perfect blend (for a northerner) and ate more light salty chips than I should have. I'm here all week for work and will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first date here together. For our 1 year anniversary we came back and we couldn't help but brag a little to our waiter. She thought it was so cool that she brought out a little chocolate cake for us, free of charge. It was a huge serving and very tender and smooth.   This would be good for a wedding reception as their banquet room next to the restaurant is huge. They skimped big time on the bar. It's a sad little nook to the side, hardly elbow room at the puny stool table.   And oh yeah - the food is kinda bland here. Just your average Mexican restaurant that seems to thrive only on account of it being off the I-10."}
{"text":"Perhaps management has been paying attention to Yelpers. Our service tonight was awesome!  My wife, daughter, and I spent a lovely evening enjoying decent Mexican food and each other's company. Our waitress was great ! Never did we have to ask for refills on anything...chips or drinks.   Contrary to recent Yelps, our food arrived SUPER fast...on a Friday night...when the waitress had to traverse multiple dining rooms to serve us.  Now, being at a resort, the food WAS a bit pricey...though, the price was easier to bear after 32 ounces of a margarita they call \"El Diablo\"...which is a top shelf margarita with Grand Marnier (as per my tip).  Either way, not a bad restaurant...plus, it's within walking distance of the resort, which comes in handy after about half of that El Diablo."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Steak was warm and under cooked. We had to send it back. The 40 minute wait ended up being and hour and 20 minutes. Maybe it had to due to the fact that they were catering an 80th birthday party, but still they should have a backup plan. On the upside, the fideo was delish!"}
{"text":"I'm being grumpy because I have had far worse food. I drank water that tasted like my swimming pool. Chips obviously not fresh. Salsa tasted like canned tomatoes.  my Chili renno was not bad. Rice and beans not bad. Overall I enjoyed the meal. But for Arizona this place is lame. Also server had the personality of a cartel thug"}
{"text":"Food is maybe slightly above average in my opinion.  I have always had great service, however.  Reliable place to go if you're in the area.  It makes my husband's trips to Fry's Electronics across the street more tolerable for me.  Last time we went, we were seated in a separate building on the other side of the patio.  Was very nice and relatively quiet.  I'm not overly fond of the patio since Baseline is so busy.  I do prefer the Aunt Chilada's on Dreamy Draw-both the food and the atmosphere.  But I'm sure I'll be back to this location again.  Damn computer geeks."}
{"text":"First tried Aunt Chilada's years ago . . . I've been to both locations and think this one is the lesser of the two.  Both locations have great atmosphere and are inviting although this one, less so as well.  I called ahead for reservations just in case and was told they don't take them.  Luckily, it was not very crowded when I showed up so reservations were not needed.  The restaurant however filled up within a half an hour so I'm glad I didn't have to wait for a table.  My dinner guest and I chose to sit in the outside patio area which is very colorful and spacious.  Service was pretty good.  We were greeted relatively quickly although there was a delay in taking our order.  I ordered what I typically order at a Mexican joint in order to compare it to similar dishes elsewhere . . . chille relleno and a tamale.  Sorry to say AC's relleno is average at best . . . it didn't jump my taste buds seeming rather bland and lifeless despite a mildly spicy green sauce.  The tamale was dry and had an unusual taste that was not particularly pleasant or familiar.  The upside was the service.  My dinner guest was an intellectually disabled woman I mentor for Special Olympics . . . she is somewhat child like and believed that her relleno which she also ordered, was \"too spicy.\"  Our waiter graciously replaced it with a milder selection and did NOT charge us for the first dish.  With all the fabulous Mexican eateries in Arizona, I wouldn't waste my time or money with AC.  There is nothing special about it although the other location may have some historical significance."}
{"text":"I made my reservation for the wrong date (yikes) and showed up with a party of six a day early. The restaurant had a wedding and homecoming and they still managed to squeeze us in for a delicious Mexican-American dinner. Our server Anthony could have been a bit more attentive (forgot drink orders twice) but the food was delicious, the price was fair, and the outdoor seating area was clean and lovely. Props to the hostesses (wish I had their names) for getting us in on a busy night. Ole'!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but a word of advice.  Never sit outside if you see ducks out there.  Case and point - I met my ex there for lunch.  The ducks were very active about leaving their droppings on the porch area where we were sitting.  When someone startled one of the ducks, it flew, dropping a bomb on the table next to us.  If you eat inside, it's not so bad.  They really need to do something about the ducks though."}
{"text":"Long long wait for seating and food. We waited for 30 minuets to be seated and then another 45 for food after we ordered. Also needs to be kept in mind we went right in the middle of the JA conference allotted dinner time. The corn chips were not very good, they were chewy and crunchy but not the good crunchy. My food was good but the rest of my family said it was just okay.  Did not try the salsa, neither my family nor I like salsa. For you want to eat here make sure you have time to spare"}
{"text":"EVERY visit here has been phenomenal. The food is always fresh and tastes great. Adult beverages are worth ordering two. A couple of the servers could benefit from some additional training, but other than that I highly recommend this place. Btw EVERYONE I've recommended this place to Love's it just as much as I do. And having eaten at various Mexican restaurants across the US this one is in my top 5."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly.  The food was okay.  Salsa was acceptable.  We sat in the dining room across the courtyard, which is what really ruined the meal.   It was difficult to enjoy anything in a room with such an over powering smell of mildew."}
{"text":"I do not understand the very low reviews that have been posted. Pleasantly spiced food, very good service and a nice atmosphere. It did have a definite resort feel to it, and there is a resort next door. This is probably the reason some of the prices are up where they are.  Okay, the bathrooms were small for this size of a restaurant. Tiny, in fact. The men's room had a tight stall and a small urinal. The ladies' room was of a similar size, I'm told.  Tables - no booths.  So far, some of the better Mexican food we've found in Phoenix.  No lunch menu or specials offered, or we'd give it another star."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you're looking for fresh, authentic Mexican food, you will find it here! Friendly and attentive as well. Homemade salsa and chips are served complimentary when you first arrive. We also ordered guacamole, which was delicious, and my husband and I shared the molcajete which is an entree made for two. Comes with carne asada, chicken, and shrimp cooked in an amazing sauce with outstanding flavors. Tortillas and two sides are also served the with meal. Prices are reasonable too. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Hit this place up for a quick happy hour meal. Had to have the enchiladas, they were a little dry. Parking may be an issue if this place was busier."}
{"text":"This would be good mexican food if we were in Quebec someplace... maybe I shouldn't say that, maybe they have quite good Mexican food in Canada...  But we have excellent Mexican food here in the Valley of the Sun.  Many five star locations.  More than any other location outside Mexico (and probably more than many a location inside Mexico)...  This spot is not one of them.   As the other reviewer stated, a pretty good happy hour, which is why it gets two stars, cause let's face it, a good happy hour can really set up your whole evening.  The food is not good."}
{"text":"This place has great food...but I particularly enjoy the outside patio atmosphere...I give the margaritas 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to authentic Mexican food... The Guacamole was fresh out of a package topped with pre-shredded generic cheese and black olives fresh from a can. Fresh avocados are not hard to come by right now. Veggies on the side were right out of the freezer. Also the bar had a line and only one bartender for the entire restaurant. They might soon be on an episode of Restaurant Impossible if it weren't for the ever changing customer base that comes from the Arizona Grand and other surrounding resorts."}
{"text":"Over priced, awful margaritas and hands down the worst chips & salsa in Phoenix. I have to wonder about the people who rated this 3 stars and up. Where are you from and what garbage do you eat at home to think this is passable as Mexican food."}
{"text":"Other than the high prices, this place is awesome! The food was delicious! Everyone that I was with during our experience here said their food was amazing and we will definitely come back for more. Again, however, the prices are a bit steep which is a shame because I know I can order the same meal for $4 to $5 less at other mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Not good at all.  Average at best.  Table we were sat at was sticky and needed wiping down, had to ask the server twice to do it.  Food was ok but not good."}
{"text":"The patio here is so cute and fun! It was to cold to sit outside but the inside was cozy. We had to wait awhile to be seated and after waiting, the bartender finally came over to seat us. The lunch specials are a great value at $7.95. I had the taco and enchilada combo, it comes with refried beans and fideo. I got the spinach con queso inside my enchilada and it was really tasty but everything else was  average mexican food. I think the chips and salsa were the best part. They are great because you get both corn and flour tortilla chips with pico de gallo and hotter sauce. Our waitress didn't come by very often and the service was pretty slow. If I were to go here again I would definitely sit out on the patio and do chips/salsa with a frosty drink."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the three stars on yelp considering how busy this place is, but three stars is right on the mark.     When I saw the sizzling molcajete on the menu, no reviews from previous diners would have stopped me. But when we arrived at 8:00 pm on a holiday weekend Sunday, the restaurant was less than half full after their rush hour. We thought we would be seated immediately, but us and three other parties ahead of us waited 45 min.   It immediately became apparent that the restaurant is poorly managed and understaffed, at least it is at 8:00pm. Although the servers and hostess were friendly and did what they could, the place was a disaster.  It appeared as though they hadn't staffed the restaurant appropriately for the holiday, or they let servers go home after the dinner rush.   The waiting area had dirty chips and salsa bowls everywhere and looked like no one had cleaned or picked up plates all night.   We waited patiently for 45 min for a table for 2 after they told us the wait was 25 min. Service was ok from our server. But the sizzling molcajete, which is one of their specialties, was not only not sizzling, it was cold in parts. Big disappointment.   I'm sure there is something that is good to eat here considering the huge crowds. Be sure you get a reservation otherwise the wait will be over an hour for dinner."}
{"text":"our server was Jonathan asked for the enchiladas de harina and much to my surprise i recieved a big burrito on the table-i told him i ordered the enchiladas and he said \" this is what u ordered its in a tortilla-i didnt eat much of it at the time because i got full on chips and salsa-when i got home the next day i was surprised that the whole \"enchilada \" was a bunch of shredded beef not the 3 combo enchiladas that was supposed to be one cheese one chicken and ONE beef i ordered so in other words i recieved the wrong item-very disapointed in john"}
{"text":"5 star service for our server, Summer. The food was amazing albeit a little expensive for what you actually get. Disappointing, yet understandable because they are part of a resort. But everything went well and she was very patient with me. I was #BeyondObsessed with both the house guacamole and the regular guacamole, as I said the food was AMAZE! so I left her a $5 tip (I was dining alone) I can't wait to bring a friend with me the next time I'm near Arizona Grand Resort"}
{"text":"I'm looking at this place as a forty year citizen of San Antonio, Texas the Tex/Mex food capital of the US. Jordan was our server and she did a good job considering.      Their Fajitas were terrible with a stale taste and they seemed rubbery. They showed up in the proper iron heating plate but it was set for Nuc so most of the veggies and chicken were blackened. The chips were nice and thick but their salsa was weird. I ordered corn tortillas but hard and dry flour ones appeared, but the butter never arrived. The pork in the giant enchilada was fatty and poor quality. The Charro beans and the rice were good. I returned the Fajitas and ordered two beef soft tacos on corn tortillas and these were fine.    The frozen Margaritas were potent but tasted unusual. It's a hoot trying to get to this place with Baseline a traffic jungle."}
{"text":"The only thing going for it was that it was wide open, they put us in the corner of the courtyard and it was good for the children to run around.   The food was terrible. Even the salsa was not good. The chips were decent, thin and crispy.  I got the cheese dip, just ok. My wife's combo of chicken flauta and taco was not good. Even the rice and beans were not that good.  What do I expect from a resort restaurant. Should've known better... but it is convenient if you're staying at the Arizona Grand resort and have a very large group.  Not only that... that charge 20% gratuity for large groups!"}
{"text":"Food and service good but VERY pricey especially for lunch. A simple cheese quesadilla was 7.50 and to top it a small scoop of sour cream in a little taco shell was an additional 2.50!  Probably wont go there again too expensive when you can go to others for much larger portions and free side of sour cream."}
{"text":"We frequent the squaw peak location - but tried this location when in the area.  Portions are smaller, menu is pretty different, prices higher.  We prefer the other location."}
{"text":"Pretty high prices for below average Mexican food. Just to give you an idea: Chipotle is be better tasting! Lol! Perfect place to grab a drink and an appetizer and sit at the patio- chips and salsa were good. Then have your main curse somewhere else. We went there for lack of restaurants at a walking distance from the Arizona Grand Resort. The patio and ambiance were nice and the weather was perfect to sit outside. Service was good. We ordered a small guacamole. The avocados were ripe, but the guacamole had no flavor and it had awkwardly a bit of shredded cheese on top. We kept adding salsa, limes and salt to add flavor to the guacamole. My friend ordered fish tacos. Parts of the fish were burnt. My other friend and I ordered a combo of enchilada with a chile relleno. Half of the plate was covered with melted yellow and white cheese. After finding the chile relleno and enchilada under the melted cheese they were ok. Asked for tortillas and charged us extra each without letting us know for chewy tortillas. The amounts of food are large, that's for sure. The side of Fideo was not very good. I don't mind paying 30-40 dollars for good food, but this felt as money not well spent."}
{"text":"Took a client here to lunch today.   Service was good. Waitress was friendly and nice. Very responsive.   Food was great. I love their jalapeño cream sauce. Not sure what is with all the negative reviews, I have nothing but good experiences here. Not super authentic, but not too fake. Sits in the middle.   Beautiful property, especially the patio."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a bite to eat at this place. Stood at hostess stand for 10 minutes.  Chef walked by. A waitress walked by.  Neither helped us. Decided to take our money somewhere it would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in almost 20 years, thought I'd give it a second try. Wish I hadn't. It took forever for the food to come out, and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Our server was nice. When the food finally came out, they forgot components of some of the dishes. Street tacos were boring - had better tacos at any of the 'bertos. My buddy had the fajitas and he said the chicken was so dry and tasteless he couldn't even eat it. To boot, it was way overpriced, probably because they are connected to the Arizona Grand resort. Half my party got sick later that night. Horrible experience, and not much has changed in 20 years."}
{"text":"A must go location for visitors.  Squaw Peak location is very memorable.  The food is good.  When I worked nearby, I ate there frequently!  Recently took my Father for his birthday and the memorabilia is neat (Squaw Peak).  The Tempe location is easy to get to and has the same great food.  Fundido is fun ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch shared here with my mom who is visiting  from. Canada. She said it was the best!"}
{"text":"I truly am not trying to be mean but this waitress is bad for business at least by my standards. She is older with an unkept appearance and somewhat spits out everything she says. She may be efficient but Her unkempt appearance made it difficult for us to enjoy our meal. If a waitress does not appear clean, hair combed back neatly, it is not easy to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's is a pretty standard American Mexican place. The food was pretty basic and no frills. I would not get the quest dip because it looked and tasted like cheese whiz. My enchiladas were warm but lacked flavor as did the beans and rice it was served with. The only part I would consider getting again was the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Much better than the North Phoenix location. The menus are different. The food is very good for the type restaurant. I really love their fish dish but it seems to be only on certain menus. The service is spotty but friendly. The patio is nice as is the room across from it."}
{"text":"Sat in the patio (soaking up the nice AZ weather)....  We had a retirement lunch here.  It was roomy and we can be noisy!  :)  The chips were good and crispy.  I got the chicken chimy, it was ok.  Almost flavorless.  I so wanted to LOVE this place but the food was just not that good.  The staff was nice!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered that the refried beans and green tomatillo sauce are not vegetarian! Refried beans are made with lard, and tomatillo sauce has a chicken stock base. Extremely disheartening but the food is still great!  Black beans are veggie friendly, and if you're looking for an additional side, they have roasted vegetables."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Mexican food of all time.  They do have good Cadillac margaritas but that the only reason I would give them a star.  The food was absolutely horrible.  I do not even want to go into detail about why it was so bad."}
{"text":"If this is the best Mexican in Phoenix (per the Arizona Grand resort), then I think Phoenix has a serious problem. Holy crap was that some greasy, bland mexican food.  Taco bell kicks the hell out of this place. Ceviche was inedible - pretty sure it was days old. Meat in fajitas must have been dredged in flour and totally overcooked. Everything was bland, and just BAD."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's at the Pointe is more about atmosphere than food.  It has a good happy hour, but the food is pretty pedestrian.  I was forced to edit and downgrade my rating because of my most recent visit.  Though the service was quite good, the food was horrific.   Was there again recently with some folks from work. It was chosen since it was close to the hotel our corporate visitors were staying. I decided to forgo the usual safe burro and try the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada. O...M...G...what a mistake.  The spinach enchilada consisted of a limp tortilla filled with frozen spinach and covered in a sauce that if it wasn't from a can was seasoned with tin...ha...ha. The relleno was stuffed with queso, breaded, deepfried, covered with the same tin flavored sauce, which in turn was then covered again with rubbery white cheese. Oh boy!  What a treat!  After this meal I have made a vow to never to stray from a burro here again.   So, if you plan on getting together with a big group for Happy Hour, Aunt Chilada's is an OK choice.  If you are looking for truly top flight Mexican food, there are other places that may be more appropriate."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go and it was horrible! Pollo fundido was cold and just tasted like chicken with sour cream.. green chili burrito was very soggy. We were very disappointed and won't be back again."}
{"text":"The Sizzling Molcajete was delicious and huge! If I was a local I would definitely be a repeat customer. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible and super expensive. Service is horrible and overall terrible experience.    Came here for dinner and it couldn't have been worse. Everything was horrible tasting and super expensive. The asada salad I ordered was worse than the salad you get at McDonald's, and it cost a whopping $15. The service was non existent, we never saw our waitress ever! drinks not refilled at all.     Avoid!!"}
{"text":"I'm AMAZED this restaurant does NOT have at least 4 stars! I did not take time to read the feedback but I can tell you the food is very good and the service is as well. I had a spinach enchilada and my friend had the shredded beef enchilada.   The selections on the menu were plentiful. The atmosphere was pleasant- enough said"}
{"text":"Worst margaritas and rudest bartender I've ever experienced. 2 stars are for good salsa and average Mexican food..."}
{"text":"A very large group of us stopped here for dinner last night. Food was wonderful, staff very friendly but service slow. Chris was wonderful but obviously understaffed. Not his fault. Would come back again in a heartbeat. Outside dining area was perfect. Nice patio heaters to keep us comfy. Food plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, however they have Pepsi, boohoo! Salsa was tasty but the chips were stale. They ambiance was bright, colorful, nice patio...food was a 3 out of 5, however it's a Lil pricey for what you get. One beef taco with rice and beans is $11. Steak fajitas are $17. Would I try this place again? Eh probably not."}
{"text":"We were in Arizona for a short vacation and my one requirement was some good Mexican food (and some sun ). Lol  While laying by the pool we started asking other guests for recommendations. Aunt Chiladas was mentioned.  They mentioned the outdoor patio and the margaritas. I immediately went to Yelp to look at the rating and reviews. Hmmm... 2 1/2 stars,  not something I will generally give a try but it was close and we were hungry.   Upon arrival,  the water feature out front was lovely. We asked for patio seating and it was also lovely. It was a little cool out but no worries because they have plenty of heaters to take the chill away until the margaritas kick in. Lol.  The service is very good. They brought us menus and water and chips and salsa right away and our server took our drink orders giving us time to look the menu over. The El Diablo is the Margarita to order. They have a tequila menu with lots of different tasty brands also. We started with the table side guacamole. Very fresh and worth the extra money to have it made to order.  I always order street tacos any chance I get. There was a choice of meats and I went with the Carne asada, Caritas and chicken tinga. It came with Pico, avocado crema and pickled onions. You can also choose between flour or corn tortillas. They were spectacular. My husband had the Pollo fundido and he said it was very good. They give you a lot of food and I think it was a good value.  We tried 2 other restaurants Macayo's Mexican Depot Cantina and Los Reyes de la Torta  and didn't care for them as much.  In fact we ended up coming back to Aunt Chiladas again our last night in Arizona. I again ordered the street tacos (why try to improve on perfection). My husband ordered a burro and enjoyed it.  I'm not sure why this restaurant only has 2 1/2 stars. It is a nice comfortable restaurant with good service,  great drink selections and awesome food priced appropriately. Give them a chance,  you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Service is a little on the slow end, but the servers are great! So if your in a rush, this is not the place for you. Otherwise, seriously the food and atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent food, pleasant wait staff, awful management and 2.5 hour dinner... I'm so disappointed in a dinner we were so looking forward to. We visit Aunt Chilada's several times a year, it's always been a favorite for out of town guests. From the wrong meal being served (and then attempted to be passed over for what she actually ordered... and this wasn't a substitution or special request, but simply an off the menu item...), to nearly twice the original 30 minute wait time to the poor wait staff being so busy there wasn't even to refill our water glasses, this visit was the last for me. I get that every establishment has the occasional bad night, but the last straw came with the manager's beyond lackadaisical and couldn't care less attitude. When management doesn't care how can it be expected that anyone else will? So long, Aunt Chilada's, it been fun."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place while in Tempe, based mostly on reviews on Yelp and another media.  I was greeted by a surly young man who may have awakened on the wrong side of the universe.  I asked for a well-lit area, and he seated me near a window.  Daylight was fast fading, as I was quickly served homemade chips and salsa.  The salsa was uninspired and bland.  The server, Samuel, was prompt and made a couple of recommendations.  I tried the pork fajitas.  By now the sun was down, and when the food arrived, it was so dark at the table, I could barely distinguish the pork from the veggies.  It was good, but I like to be able to see my food.  The candles at the table were sorely inadequate.  I asked Samuel about the lighting, and he said only the manager can change it and he/she had gone home already.  I was the sole diner in that dining room, BTW.  There were others in another part of the restaurant that I could hear, but couldn't see.  I left over half of my meal there, just because I couldn't see any longer what it looked like.  Very disappointing.  I wouldn't return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The salsa is chunky and delicious! I got fajitas, they were decent and my wife got enchiladas, she got one with green salsa and one with red salsa, she liked the red salsa the best. I didn't have any problems with my refills, the waitress was nice and efficient. We finished our meal with fried ice cream and we all enjoyed it. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and never had a bad experience.  It is what it is and I like it for that. It's not gourmet, it's not fancy or original probably not even authentic, but it's dependable.  I've always been served HOT decent tasting food. Their salsa isn't  half bad even though its made from canned tomatoes with added fresh cilantro, the chips are great, always hot and fresh.  Their Carnitas are some of my favorite, my husband is  fan of the cheese enchiladas and I also order the fish tacos too(see pic). All these items have been consistently good.  It can get busy with the annoying resort crowd, but if your looking for just plain old generic Mexican food that will fill you up and not rip you off, this is it. Yes I've had better and yes there is better, but like I said before:  It is what it is and I like it for that. It's not gourmet, it's not fancy or original probably not even authentic, but it's dependable. And I've definitely had worse!"}
{"text":"I was in such a good mood to write something positive, after all it was 80 degrees, sunny and we were sitting outside on the colorful patio pretending it was summer instead of the 10 degrees we left back home in Minneapolis.  On the positive side our server stopped by our table right away with a huge bowl of crispy chips and two large bowls of salsa. We ordered two patron margaritas that came pretty quickly and were good, although clearly not made with fresh juice.  As for the food, its a bit on the mass market side in terms of taste and flavor and certainly not the authentic Mexican I was hoping for.  Perhaps I've just gotten spoiled by the number of great new places serving fresh exciting Mexican food.  If you have kids and are looking for something mild, then this could be the place."}
{"text":"Oh dear god where do I start?! Oh with the less then stellar waitress I had the displeasure of dealing with! What an epic fail she was, if you can't handle a large party (of 6) then maybe you should let your mgr know and bail before you get in way to deep....as you did Saturday night! Let's start with the drink order...if you can't remember something...write it down...maybe then it wouldnt take 2 people and 3 attempts at getting it right..sprite vodka and grenadine...how you managed to get root beer out of any of that I will never Marsha, I will never know! Then you disappear before we order food! Finally get to order the rest of the drinks for the table (had to send 2 back..tasted awful) and some apps...then you were hard to find once again Marsha! Finally we were able to find you (yes...we went looking)and ordered the food some how from you not writing things down our order got messed up...go figure right?! Not such a great first impression...I'll stick to taco bell for my Mexican food from now on!"}
{"text":"This sorry shithole really could only survive in Touristville adjacent to the resort. Good God! I actually felt like my wallet got gang-raped for the experience: one dinner + one quesadilla appetizer + three margaritas = $60. What in the hell is that!? It would be one thing if the food was amazing.... but the so-called green chilis in my quesadilla were cut up raw mild boring jalapenos that added absolutely zero to the food (but cost an extra $2). The poor downtrodden quesadilla soon sweated an enormous pool of grease, which soaked its entire underside, rendering it inedible. One of my friends passed around a guac appetizer, and the raw onions in there would either put hair on your chest or singe it clean off, not sure which. Blech!  I will add a 1/2 star because the margaritas were tasty. Either they used high end tequila, or there was no booze at all in there. For the price, I would hope it was nice tequila. Clearly, since I can't really tell either way, there wasn't much in there. I could also go so far as to add a half star for the ambiance. Total old-school Arizona touristy kitsch, and the patio was very nice for our group gathering. However, with the preponderance of wonderful places with outdoor seating, I doubt the patio alone would ever lure me back. See ya at Los Dos!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Other than the great patio, everything else is awful. Food was awful, management was even more terrible. No thanks."}
{"text":"I loved the molcajete! The margarita was really good as well, and it sneaks up on you.. i could barely make it to the car!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan. My first visit to this place was wayy back when, literally. I had my first Aunt Chilada's experience when I was 8 and my family and I have been visiting ever since then. Not sure why it took me so long to leave a review.  They have one of the biggest tequila selections in Arizona, by far! And if you're a Tequila connoisseur like myself you will appreciate it.  I'm a big fan of their Sunday brunch. They have a great selection at great prices and can really modify a the plates to your liking if you want. If it's a nice day out, I suggest sitting out on the patio. They have umbrellas to shade your area, but it's cute to see the ducks from the pond hanging out and walking around."}
{"text":"My review:  Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.   The food here was just okay and the prices are high.  The staff was friendly and attentive however my entree arrived 1 minute after my soup arrived.  Poor planning on my servers part.  Tonight I had the three enchilada plate and corn with chorizo soup.  I am not a fan!  I haven't been here in several years.  Now I remember why."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went here on a date night and it was great! Great atmosphere, great food, delicious chips and salsa before the meal(I was a tad full for my food), and superb service! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this is such an Arizona institution. I came here recently while on vacation in Phoenix. It had been at least 10 years since I had good Mexican food. And let's be honest. While this is not totally authentic Mexican it's good old AZ-style Sonoran-American combo plate comfort food. And it's really not that easy to find on the east coast. I grew up on this stuff so the nostalgia factor is huge. Such a pleasure having a chile relleno with frijoles refritos, rice and giant frozen margarita. Ahhhh, watch out for that brain freeze. The chips and salsa could have been a little better, but I ate too many of them as is."}
{"text":"We ate there on a Sunday early dinner.  We sat outside, nice with the Mexican music.  I had three item combo, cheese enchilada, beef taco, bean tostado, the meal was excellent, brought some home.  My husband ordered the chili relino and spinach enchilada with cream sauce, his was also excellent, and he brought some home.  We didn't have a drink but the looked great! Would go back."}
{"text":"Met my parents here for an early dinner on a Saturday.  Cute place, quick service. We enjoyed the 2 types of salsa.  The first is a very chunky mild tomato salsa and the other is smoother by spicier.   We all enjoyed to charro beans but mixed opinions on the fide.  The burros and chimis were well portioned meat to tortilla ratio.  My only complaint is how the street tacos were served- covered in cabbage to the extent that I could not identify which taco was which.  Very difficult to eat and enjoy.   Will be back to try some margaritas!"}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of positive comments but no hate either.  I just think it's a tourist trap that has been here for years and gone down hill. It is over priced, and the food is not that great.  The salsa was ok.  I am not super fussy when it comes to Mexican food but I do know good Mexican food.  It sure can be hard to find great Mexican food in Phoenix (of all places).  Explain that to me. The service we had was great, nice young man.  I do not know if because the property surrounding the restaurant has changed hands so frequently, that has had something to do with the quality of food at this place but I remember 20 yrs ago the food was much better.  I would not recommend this place to any friends or out of town guests.  We will not be returning.  The food is boring."}
{"text":"I normally have great things to say about this place. Always ask for flour tortillas chips. Might want to pass on the fideo. It generally has the consistency of spaghetti. Aside from that, the food is usually great. Lots of lower calorie options available.  Today, is not one of the days I have rave reviews. We sat there waiting for 30 minutes after being told it would be a 10 minute wait. They said no tables available. Do they not understand that we can see the patio and half the dining area from the waiting area? We could see 8 open tables in the patio. 5 open tables in the 1st dining area. We passed13 open tables when we were finally called inside.   We waited another 15 minutes at our table before we were even acknowledged by our waitress. She took mine and my husband's drink orders, and ran off to go fill them. That would have been super awesome, except there were 5 of us at the table!!!  We ordered drinks for the rest of our party when she brought our drinks. She brought our food, and then hurried away again. I had to stop her at another table to remind her about drinks for the rest of my table. The drinks were for my children!!   This was honestly the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. This used to be one of my favorite places. Now I'm not sure if I would ever recommend this to my out of town guests again. For a restaurant that gets so much resort business, you'd think they'd treat their customers better."}
{"text":"We celebrated Mother's day early. 5 mom's out for dinner with a wonderful waitress named Katie! She was a beautiful spirit, knowledgeable and very attentive to our needs. This waitress is the reason this restaurant is successful. I've lived here in the valley 17 yrs, this was my first visit but not my last. Great food and superb service 5/6/2018 @5pm."}
{"text":"While enjoying our stay-ca at Arizona Grand Resort, we ventured off to Aunt Chilada's for dinner after the water park. We were seated after an average waiting time of 25 minutes. Our appetizers arrive quickly, the street corn was bursting with flavor! Although our actual meal was delayed, the service and compensation for the delay made the experience a positive memory. The entire table partook in the \"birthday\" dessert. Worth 4+stars"}
{"text":"I ordered a one item combo, chicken burro, with rice and fideo. Chicken in the burro is canned for sure..I couldn't eat it, so asked for a cheese enchilada instead. The corn tortilla was hard af, the enchilada sauce was disgusting! If you know how to make Mexican food... This place is not for you."}
{"text":"Queso dip and chips awesome, salsas very good, service was very good. Entrees were good (chile verde burrito and pollo fundido) but not great. Beers were plenty cold. Would go back without hesitation. Nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food? I don't so!  I went in on a Tuesday afternoon with a few friends. We were not greeted when we walked in. However, we were seated with in a couple of minutes. One of my friends noticed that the chips were stale so she proceeded to ask for fresh beans. I ordered 2-enchilada dinner with black beans. The tortillas from the enchiladas were tough, I couldn't cut them using only a fork. Enchilada's are supposed to be tender, it really seemed as the tortillas were left out and used the next day. The Black beans were so bland and came out of a can. I ordered a side of guacamole and had to ask the nice server to take it back. It tasted really bad-not fresh at all. I have given two stars for the service. It's not the waiters fault so I can appreciate them."}
{"text":"Large portions so you might consider sharing a meal. We received a complimentary cheese crisp from our hotel. It was delicious but huge for just 2 of us. I had the fish tacos, black beans and fideo. I make my own fideo at home and this was equally as good. My husband ordered the crane asana street tacos and said the meat was great but could only eat 2/3.  I would definitely return when I'm hungrier."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location probably 5 times now and this last time was by far the best service I have had ever! I ordered the Pollo Fundido and it was the bomb! I was stuffed for sure. The free chips and salsa were delicious! To top it off I ordered a sangria margarita and I was blown away but how delicious it was. To end the amazing meal we had fried ice cream that was a trip to heaven! I wish it was not so far away from my house so I could come back again. My only concern was that the food came out so fast that we did not get to eat a ton of chips and salsa or have another round of drinks!"}
{"text":"On my grand return to the valley, I was craving Mexican. However, by the time my friends and I got around to eating and stopped chatting, we knew there would be a long line at Los Dos, so we swung by Aunt Chiladas. While it was good, it wasn't fantastic, and I'm not sure I'd do it again.  The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing.   After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way.   The fried ice cream was good, but not the best I've had.  In the end, this was just a good learning experience...but it was great to be back amongst friends."}
{"text":"Where to start? Tables were unbussed so we had to sit at a dirty one. Wait staff ignored us for 20 minutes until finally a busser decided that he would acknowledge us after the fifth time he walked past. We wanted to leave but had some other folks coming to meet us so we were pretty much locked in and resigned ourselves to waiting. Finally one of the three waitresses in the bar area took pity on us and got our drink order and appetizer. Drinks took another 10 minutes and then we were ignored again for the rest of the hour that it took us to get our check and get out of this sh*thole. Oh but only I could give half a star. :("}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the waitress Marcia. if it wasn't for her then we would never go back. she is so kind and pleasant and thoughtful and attentive and the list goes on and on. we only go when she's there and we only sit in her section she takes care of all of our needs and more. we love her and we love the food and when she's not there we walk right back out she is their biggest asset and she deserves a raise and a bonus and a plaque on the wall I love Marcia I love this restaurant"}
{"text":"Yum and yet a bit of a yawn.  Yes it was a bit of yesterday as I appreciated the decor and the speed of the service.  Nothing stood out much.  The place was clean and made me think of driving a few hours further south for the real deal...and that cannot be bad...right?  To be reminded of the real thing so much that you want to leave where you are and go get the real thing?  Your call...not yuck, though."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I enjoyed the enchiladas and the fideo. This place is awesome !!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Outdoor seating is quaint with romantic lighting.  Tableside guacamole is amazing.  The Pollo Fundido did not disappoint and my taste buds highly recommend pairing your meal with the Fideo and Charro beans.  I've also had the opportunity to taste the Steak Tampiquena and I find it very typical for Mexican restaurants to prepare their skirt steak in a manner that does not break down the connective tissues.  The taste was as expected, marvelous.  Of course the staff was awesome and very attentive."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but I have definitely had better.  The outside atmosphere was very nice, the staff was also very friendly.  I'd go back but it isn't what i'm accustomed too."}
{"text":"Well after having this place hyped up on our drive in I was very excited to go there my very first evening in town.  My wife, two friends, and I wandered over and were met with a 20 minute wait which I thought was a good sign.  My wife and one friend ordered specials while the other two of us ordered the three taco meal. The score ended up with the specials winning but the tacos did not. My tacos were LUKE warm and very dry like they had been sitting too long. The double stacked corn tortillas couldn't hold up and fell apart.  Extraordinarily disappointed.  Having been a westerner and now an easterner I was looking forward to really good Mexican. This didn't get me there."}
{"text":"Location: Right off Baseline Road. Across from Fry's Electronic Store  Atmosphere: Not bad..has a nice little front room and seemed clean  Food: Absolutely horrible. The food was smothered in sauce which worries me because I feel they do this to cover up something and it did...flavor.  We ordered the \"Special\" which I feel would have been the best to try...it was very salty and had little overall flavor. The cheese crisp appetizer was pretty much a tortilla smothered in tons of oily cheese. was completely upset and will never go back again.  Recommend: Absolutely not. I felt Taco Bell has more authenticity than this place. I hate to say that but it was a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I was staying at The Arizona Grand for 4th of July and had dinner since its located really close by. The food was really good with big portions. There was 3 of us so we opted for the pitcher of sangria which I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Mostly with business associates.  The food is good but average for an Americanized Mexican Food place. I've never had anything bad here. Every, but it's not worth the drive from my home.  If your close by, it is better than other places nearby. You do get plenty of food for the money and it is satisfying."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we celebrate my friend's birthday here.  What a mistake.  The table was akward for 8 people to see each other but hey, we didn't make a reservation. The sad part is that two of us ordered the fajitas (including the birthday gal).  The food arrived and sat next tto our table for well over 5-minutes.  By the time the waitress came to serve our food, it was cold (although we commented on how when the fajitas had first arrived they were not making a sizzling sound).   The waitress appeared upset that we were wanting our food at least worm vs. cold.  She took it to the kitchen and brough back fajitas that had been stuck in the over.  Food was HOT but now way overcooked.  I wont' be returning  to this place anytime soon -- with some many other great choices, i'm sorry my friedn chose this restaurant."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's had some good things going for it and some not so good things going for it. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and loved how the dining rooms were in separate little buildings and how the courtyard was beautifully lit, it added an air of intimacy to the restaurant.   We didn't have an appetizers, we noshed on the awesome portion of chips and salsa we were served, very yummy! For my meal I ordered the veggie enchiladas and a raspberry margarita (they were out of pomegranate for shame!). The enchiladas were not great at all and totally fell apart as I was eating them. Definitely worth the loss of a star or two. The margarita on the other hand was supremely delicious and it was not long before I'd drank it up.   If I'm ever in Tempe again I don't think Aunt Chilada's would be my first pick but overall it's an okay joint."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by aunt chilada's. I usually steer clear of restaurants that my fellow yelpers rate so low. However, it was my friend's birthday and this is where she choose. I started out with a rum runner that was very much on the pricy side, $9. It was strong, I wasn't expecting to get half my money's worth but I definitely did.  The chips were brought out quickly and I was given a mild salsa and a spicy salsa. They were both really good. That's always my favorite part of Mexican restaurants.  I'm not always a fan of Mexican food unless it's authentic. Most places, are too Tex mex for my liking. I ordered the special, a 6 oz steak with a cheese enchilada, black beans, and rice. I ate it all. It could have been the rum runner, but this was by far one of the best Mexican places I've eaten at.  They also brought out a free birthday dessert with a candle that was delicious and big enough to share. The service was good, but it's a bit too pricy for what you get. I think because  it's so close to the Arizona grande resort they price gouge. We didn't have reservations, but it was only two of us. It looked big enough to accommodate big groups and had many tables. The patio tables look lovely when if starts to cool downs."}
{"text":"My Husband went in for a quick lunch and while he had been here before I had not.  The food was good but our waitress Beverly was a very delightful woman.  She kept our drinks full the entire time, always had a smile on her face and just an all around pleasant woman to talk too.  I think she said that she had been there for 18 years don't quote me on that though.  She made our visit a great experience and we may just go back in the future."}
{"text":"Pass by this place daily and decided to give it a try one afternoon for lunch. Not sure why they don't have a higher rating. We were not seated promptly, and it wasn't super busy doing the week, so I don't know know what the delay was.  Fajitas, a chimichanga and two margaritas became our lunch. The dishes both came with well seasoned and rice and the chimi also came with black beans.  The chips and salsa brought before the entrées included both a spicy and chunky type. Both were awesome.   Wait staff was professional and had no issues. Food and drinks came out as ordered and was great."}
{"text":"Como se dice \"meh\"? Aunt Chilada's sucks mucho. Lets start with a very average margarita for $12, an $11 Mojito made with a mix, and chips with a salsa that could call  any supermarket aisle home. Entrees are way over priced for a very mediocre offering.  I always clean off my plate, seriously concerned with the plight of starving children in third world countries, but on this day even that thought couldn't get me to finish. The tortillas were horrible, how the hell do you screw up a tortilla? Service was also sub par, bordering on rude. Never again, or as the say in Mexico, nunca mas."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!  A full tourist trap.  Went there after golf today to wait for traffic to ease up. Sat at the disgusting, old, dingy bar. (Bathrooms are worse). We order the chicken chimichanga.  HORRIBLE!!!  How you make Mexican food tasteless is a mystery but they did it.  Worst Mexican food I've ever had, hands down. Taco Bell is better.  Service was horrible.  How this place stays open is beyond me .... actually, I'm guessing the only people that go are staying at the resort.  Suckers.  The place needs to be bulldozed."}
{"text":"Aunt Chilada's it is time to hang up the towel..reinvent yourself as a nursing home cafeteria and everyone will be happy.   Your nachos are, well Auntie -they're nasty. The cheese is stringy, the chips stale and the chicken tastes canned..The worst part is all you put on nachos is cheese, beans and chicken - no salsa, no guac, no olives, no onions...Alot of nots.  The hair that was impaled in the cheese is actually not what stopped me from eating...the lack of taste is was haulted me, the hair just confirmed the decision for me.    The margaritas are $8.00 which silly me, made me think that, here in  the land of the sun, where everyone serves margaritas as cheaply as possible, for $8 I must be getting something really special. No, I was wrong.  Nothing special about your cheap tasting tequila and even cheaper mix that is shot off the bartender's gun in a standard pint glass for $8...seriously? 16oz of Mrs. T's and a shot of tequila or rubbing alchohol, everything had the taste of shortcuts at Aunties.   Your bathrooms are dirty and really you have the resort golf crowd not a bunch of rowdies, so its' not them, its you not checking on the faciities throughout the night. And, given that I am paying $8 for margies and $12 for some stale chips, a clean bathroom would have been a nice touch.   Your staff is quite nice and you have plenty of them. So, though you were serving me crap and ripping me off while you were doing it, you were really nice about it. I didn't boher to complain about the hair because if I started with the hair, were would my complaint have ended...again, retirement is the key.   So, Auntie, your mexican restaurant days should be coming to a close. Maybe lay off the booze and consider a buffet style generic mexican food in a nice assisted living facility. This would be your true calling but selling overpriced generic, crap tasting mexican food at the foot of a resort needs to come to a stop - someone is going to get hurt."}
{"text":"It was nice to sit outside in the spring time. It's pretty quaint. The chips and salsa were good. The food was decent. The burrito was good and was big."}
{"text":"Surprised this only has 2.5 stars. Clean. Sweet ambience with a fountain feature and great patio. Our server was VERY sweet, attentive and prompt. Our whole family thought it was delicious. I had the street tacos-mahi, carnitas and carne asada-the marinade was amazing on all 3, tortillas hand made and ingredients were fresh. My husband and sister in law had the chimichanga and devoured it, mother in law loved the chicken tortilla soup. We ordered sopas for dessert, and they are made fresh and hot so they accommodated my request to leave off the cinnamon & sugar.  Overall food and service were fantastic. I left off one star only because the prices are higher than most Mexican places, but the portions were HUGE, and my street tacos had a ton of meat on each one."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food goes, this wasn't the best that I have ever had.  However if you work in the area, it is a good destination for clients or family that are in town shopping at Mill, this should be a viable option.  The food is what I would classify as MexiCali.  Definitely not the home raised Mexican food from Tucson.  Give it a shot, Yelp me back and tell me how it was."}
{"text":"We had heard that Aunt Chilada's was a great place for Mexican food and decided to give it a try.  It was close to 1PM.  The small dining area next to the hostess was empty and I asked if we could sit there.  Hostess said no but would seat us in the main dining room.  That place was packed.  It was not only packed it was extremely noisy.  There were three groups and individual tables were placed between them.  Oh my!  What an awful environment.  We waited for a while and no server arrived.  So, we checked out the lunch menu.   Nothing about this menu was inexpensive.  It was pretty pricey for lunch.  The single taco plate was $10.99.  We sat there debating whether to stay or leave.  Our server hadn't arrived yet and too many negatives were already coming up about this place --- loud, expensive and slow service is what we were seeing.  No thanks.  We went down the road and had a great lunch."}
{"text":"I really don't like aunt enchiladas not very good food. I don't see what the big deal is."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I was starving... I liked the food.  We were at the Pointe for a trade show and this is where we ended up for lunch.  We had no wait and the food was really good, I got a shredded beef cheese crisp and my coworker got the chimi plate.  The chips and salsa were good.  Only issue I had was my empty ice tea glass, I finally had to ask for more when our bill was delivered."}
{"text":"This place is on my regular lunch rotation when meeting friends.  I usually get the Aunt Chilada's Special which is a green chili chimichanga, or the tacos pescado (fish tacos).  It is the only place I have ever had fedeo which is a Mexican spaghetti.    I like the food, and more importantly, my Chicana wife likes the food and she is picky about Mexican food.  This is not the cheapest place for good Mexican food, but it is a fun place to meet with friends."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been to Aunt Chiladas....and what a disappointment!  Went with a large group, we had horible service.  We were not brought refills, the food came very slowly.  We had to go track down our server and a manager to request service.   Seems like since they were getting an automatic 20% tip because we were a large group she must have gone on break or something.    Food was very greasy, had oil ladden calabasita and a shredded beaf greasy taco.     The group I was with was a lot of fun....but the food was not good, and teh service horrible.  Next time the group meets it will not be at this place."}
{"text":"Mexican food is always a good idea. Considering this is suppose to be a part of the resort the prices were average not high. The food was good. I didnt find the guacamole to be that good like I saw in the reviews. Chips were bland ( i like salted chips) and salsa was ok. But they were free so..."}
{"text":"Not even worth my time to write a full review. Chicken is very dry, prices are high, service is terrible, and they got rid of the flower tortilla chips. Stay away."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this place it was a huge disappointment!!  I rode give zero stars but they force you in order to post a review.  I do not  recommend unless you like giving your money away"}
{"text":"I had the 5 shrimp on the skewers and it was delicious.  I like animals and wildlife so I thought it was cute that ducks were swimming in the outside fountain and also walk around the patio in case someone wants to throw them a chip but you may want to sit inside which we did since it was a work dinner. My co-worker had the chicken fundido which she really liked too. The hostess is friendly."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp so thought I would give it a try, sorry I did. The salsa is one of the worst I have ever tried. People in the rest of my party were also very displeased with their entrees to say the least. Ordered a cocktail, which the waitress just raved about, why I don't know. Was basically a kool-aide drink in a cocktail glass. But here lies my biggest problem. Started with the guacamole, chips and salsa. Not the best but eatable. Here comes my entree, OMG. I thought I was going to die! Literally! Two bites or so and I start feeling queasy. And I mean this crap won't stop. So I take a trip to the rest room and figure I will let it pass. But my stomach says different. I started throwing up there proceeded to come home and couldn't stop until every little thing I had eaten at that God forsaken place was out of my system. Will I try it again? I say not. When I told the waitress about the incident she was very nice and quite apologetic. The other women that was called over never introduced herself and was quite rude. Offered to take it off my bill and that was that. By the way I ordered plate # 2 with a green tamale al a cart. I still feel queasy just thinking about it. Good thing there were no great smells or aromas or I probably would not be able to eat this combo any where else either. And to think I went there with such great expectations. I wish that woman, whom ever she may be, would have been courteous. Then maybe I might think of giving them another, try not. Lol."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant great location. Good atmosphere with candlelit table. Wonderful waitress. The food and the Margaritas are to die for. Certainly rated this as our favorite. Thank you"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on this place.  It is grossly overpriced mediocre food.  This is not authentic Mexican food more like Americanized Mexican food gone wrong. The chicken enchilada were made of some shredded chicken mixed an odd tomato sauce/seasoning. It was NOT good and the portions were too small for  the price. The fideo that came with the enchiladas was a disaster.    I will say that the kids menu portions were huge.  A really large taco and a really big bean burro were the best deal there.  The kids price was definitely cheap considering the size.  We didn't have any alcohol so I can't comment on that but either way stay away from  this place it's not worth your money.  We ordered a fajita plate, two enchilada plates, two kids meals, and 5 sodas and our check was almost $ 90. Considering food was NOT good this was a waste of money. Our server was very nice though."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic delicious fresh and authentic Marcia is a great server she help us choose our dishes. I had the aunt chilada what a dish flavor are right on target just enough spice beef melting in your mouth and the tacos super delicious with fresh crispy cabbage and sweet and tangy  this was a perfect combination and I do not even talk about the fried burrito if you stay in Phoenix you have to try!!!!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Still like the one off of Dreamy Draw Dr. near Squaw Peak. This is the second time I've been here and the food just isn't as good. We also had the unfortunate luck of showing up right after a couple big groups so our service suffered as well.   Floors and tables were less than clean. Not disgusting but you would assume they must have been short staffed and that's why; benefit of the doubt.   I did my trademark chicken enchilada which was pretty dry and Jen did some dish with chicken stuffed in poblano peppers. She liked it a lot. I also need to give kudos for offering to swap our the standard sides of beans and rice for one of their soups. Very cool.   Overall was less than impressed and I guess I'm stuck making the 30 min drive to the good Aunt Chelada's versus the five minute one to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered the tortilla soup and it was very good.  Hubby went with caso appetizer and added chorizo. Very good also. Ordered chimichangas and enjoyed those too. Overall a good value for the experience"}
{"text":"Went with a small group for a weekday lunch.  Server was very friendly and prompt with drinks and chips but didn't come back to take our orders for a very long time.  I had a chicken chimi, it was all white meat and plenty of it and it was HUGE.  Decent place for lunch."}
{"text":"The food was good the beverages were goid but the service was terrible.  The waitress we has was snobby and stand offish.  When I asked about a dish or drink she said. \"I don't know\"  and that's it.  So the food and drinks get 5 starts but the service gets 1 star"}
{"text":"My favorite \"Mexican\" in Phoenix.... If you are planning a lunch trip, be sure to get there early (before 11:30) or you will be in for a wait - but it is well worth it.  I LOVE their salsa & chips, the best anywhere IMO and they also offer a 'hot' version that you can mix in to taste.  I am a fan of 'hot' foods with a bit of pep to them and Aunt Chilada's delivers on specific dishes (ie there is plenty of other offerings if spicy is not your style). The 'Aunt Chilada Special' is my favorite - a cubed, spicy beef filled enchilada covered with both red and green sauces, topped off with cheese and sour cream, served with a choice of sides (I normally go with rice and 'fidao' (sp) - kinda \"Mexican spagetti\".  I have been eating here for many years as do many people I know, there IS a reason it is always packed - Highly recommended.  There is seating both inside and outside, so depending upon the weather and your personal taste you can do either."}
{"text":"This place is average. The place is really nice inside, but the food is just alright. Pricing is fair for what they serve. The desert it's pretty good with limited options tho. Our server was fine, but she never came back to check in on us. lol"}
{"text":"First time experiencing this place was April 22 for a special event. We were seated on the patio. Beautiful outdoor setting, but our location was in direct sunlight. They did place a few umbrellas around which helped some. Had 3 options to choose from; Chimichanga, Enchiladas or a Creamy Chicken Fundito. I went with that. The Jalapeño Cream sauce was delicious but unfortunately my chicken was extremely dry. At the end of our meal we were served beautiful desserts. A chocolate cake & flan. Both were good. Chocolate Cake wonderfully rich &  The Flan was light & appropriately caramelized. Service was great for such a large party. We had about 3 servers assisting our table. Will come back again and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"This review is for the incredible service of our waitress, Katie! Katie was absolutely phenomenal, and made our dinner such a wonderful experience. Katie was so friendly with a smile and cheerful attitude, and truly showed she loves her job! She was attentive, kind, and defines the kind of customer service people dream about. Management: Please give Katie a pat on the back because she truly is an asset to your business!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we've dined here. The only gripe I have is the price has gone up significantly on their entrees. None the less I always enjoy their shredded beef with chimichanga, burritos, etc. they have been consistent on the taste. The shredded beef is like dried meat & usually other Mexican food shredded beef are greasy or too much Ah Jus & they kill it with salt properties."}
{"text":"Disappointed to see the bad reviews, because this place is really good. Still one of my favorite Mexican places in Phoenix. I've been dining here for 6 years, since it's down the street from our office, and it's still a great place to go for a quick lunch or after work cocktails.   The service here is friendly, attentive and quick. I made a reservation for lunchtime for a party of 8 and we were in and out of there in under an hour! The food was served hot and delicious. And the best part was they treated our co-worker with a birthday cake, which we laughed at, because the lunch was set up because he was leaving our company. We had played along anyway and he enjoyed his delicious flan birthday treat.   I've tried many dishes here and they are all so good. The pollo fundido is delicious and the burritos will last you for days because they are huge portions. But my favorite part of the dish is the pinto beans and rice. So good! And the nachos are always served hot and the most flavorful salsa in town.   It's not in the most desirable locations, but well worth a visit if your in the South Mountain area.   The outdoor patio is not the best, I'll have to agree. The seats are pretty low and there seems to be birds feeding from the berries in the trees, because we would constantly get hit by a berry and at one point a bird pooped on our menu. So try to get a seat in the patio away from the entrance and the large tree sitting there. But on a beautiful spring day, it's the perfect place to be to watch the sunset and enjoy a margarita!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was quite disappointed in the drink (don't think it had a drop of the patron in it) and the food as it was fairly bland.  The waitress was rushing us out so much as to picking up our chips and salsa and almost our unfinished drink glasses while we are still sitting at the table.  I can honestly say it will be a long time before I consider this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Our service was amazing. John took excellent care of our party of 3. The food was hot and delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very basic Americanized Mexican food for the family. Chips were stale, salsa was bland. Food was fine. Nothing wrong with it technically but it's like a Mexican chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short.   Bad.   Service was painfully slow and pretty negligent. We never even got refills on our water. The food was bland, I've had better from (insert ANY americanized Mexican food restaurant here).   It's a shame because they are in a great location and have an amazing patio. I would never recommend for anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Amazing. I loved every bite. Our waitress was extremely friendly.my wife wants to travel back to the resort just for aunt cheladas."}
{"text":"My husband and I went once and both didn't like our food. About a year later we went back thinking we would give them another chance, and same situation. Food was gross. Too bad because it's a great location."}
{"text":"So having tried this before I went back for lunch. Beat the rush but it still took 30 mins to get the order. Nice service but over priced for what showed up from the kitchen. Salsas were fair but nothing special. Sadly the relleno was flavorless and the black beans also. Other order was a SW chicken caesar. The waitress asked if having it tossed was okay but when it came it had only had dressing in a big glop in the bottom of the bowl. For $10 it was pretty small and a salad only costs about $1.00 at most w/o chicken... which was well grilled and tasty but the cheese added was pretty bland as well. Sorry but will choose another Mexican restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"The soup was bland, the chips were soaked in oil, the salsa tasted sour. I will not go back. The waitress spoke little english and talked too fast to understand her."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to eat here during the weekend celebration of one of my best friend's birthday.  We were staying in Tempe as we were also attending the Arizona Jazz Festival.  In a word the customer experience was substandard.  \"Joseph\" the waiter was not particularly friendly or responsive...Whatever caused his bad day should not have impacted the service provided.  The food was not good at all....two of us had chicken enchiladas...dry, tasteless, with a smear of sauce...black beans and rice had no seasoning at all...so bland.  I asked for more sauce for my enchilada and the server never brought it...apologize for forgetting...although I did see him quickly fulfill the request of a neighboring table for guacamole.  Two things were okay with this experience...the little bridge walkway from the parking lot was great for pictures and when I went to the bar to get surprise Patron shots for us...the bartender was a bit more friendly....Although \"Joseph\" did condescendingly let me know...\"you do know that I can get your drink orders'...in which I wanted to say \"Yes...I've been to many restaurants and remember how it works and you would be required to have checked back often enough for me to to have place my order with you\".   I will not go back or recommend that anyone go there either."}
{"text":"Overall this place was just ok. Went on a Sunday afternoon, I guess it was slow service so they were seating everyone in this small room and the tables were so close together it was very uncomfortable and loud. Our server was nice but the service was not anything special. The pricing is expensive but they give u large portions. For example  The nachos on the appetizer menu is $16.95 but it feeds 4 people. Pina Colada was $9 and not very good. It was all ice and I did not taste one ounce of alcohol. I did not like the chips as salsa...the salsa was a little bland. The patio looks interesting and I could see it being a nice atmosphere in the evening."}
{"text":"Just went to Aunt Chilada's yesterday while staying at the Arizona Grand and it was a great experience. Although there were plenty of tables inside and outside that were available when we arrived, but we waited for nearly half an hour to be seated. But at least they had a waiting area with chips and salsa for us to eat while we waited. Once we finally were seated though the service was really good and we had a very nice waiter. The scenery outside was very cool and i loved all of the colored tables, chairs, etc. There also were a family of ducks that were just walking around outside that the employees told us were always there. Before we ordered food we were brought chips and salsa that you could tell was freshly made that I very much enjoyed. I ordered an shredded chicken enchilada and it can with a side of rice and refried beans. It was very good and very filling. They give you a very decent amount of food for what you pay. But overall I would recommend this restaurant and the overall experience."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've eaten at Aunt Chilada's. I get out to the east side very infrequently, but we were in the area and decided to stop in for lunch. I liked the pond with the ducks out front. When we first walked in, I was hit with the smell of toilet water, like the floors had been mopped with dirty water. Not very appetizing. Fortunately the hostess walked us out across the patio to a different building. It smelled more like food over there so that was a good sign. After we were seated, we waited for quite some time before anyone came to greet us, take our drink order, or bring chips & salsa. We were actually contemplating leaving right before our server walked by and said she'd be right with us. When she came to get our drink order, we also ordered our food since we'd had plenty of time to decide. I went with the chicken enchilada, black beans, and rice. The bowl of chips and bowl of salsa were huge. That was different. The first couple of chips I had were underwhelming because they were cold, but then I got to some warm chips that tasted much fresher. It's a very noticeable difference. The food came out rather quickly, which was surprising considering how long it took to be acknowledged in the beginning. I enjoyed the rice & black beans. The chicken in my enchilada reminded me of canned chicken. It really didn't have a lot of flavor. The enchilada relied on the red sauce for taste and I wasn't very impressed. Also our last water refills tasted odd, like it shared a spout with some variety of lemonade that got mixed in with the water. Not good. But I'm glad I had a chance to remind myself what Aunt Chilada's food is like. I see no need to drive out to the east valley to eat here again."}
{"text":"I was here on business for a week and decided to stop in for lunch with some other guys. I am from an area with a rather large hispanic population and as such I frequent Mexican and other hispanic places frequently and one thing that I noticed is that their prices are steep...but that could just be a cost of living difference. I had the buffet which included several chimichanga's rice, beans, and salad. Everything tasted great. They brought out typical nachos and salsa which did not push the envelope by any means. The mild salsa was pretty much diced tomatoes. The hot was not very hot at all. The staff was friendly and attentive. We were in and out pretty fast despite a lunch rush. Its a good find."}
{"text":"I had been here years ago I double checked online to see if the menu had changed and it seemed the same... well once I got there there was at least six items that were no longer... that's fine.. I will get something else...chips were 2 day old at least so so stale... the food was just as bad. Will never come back it was really really bad."}
{"text":"5 stars for Jeff the bartender!  Best margarita in town!!  He felt with our crowd like a pro!"}
{"text":"On a hot summer day in early August upon deciding to eat Mexican food, we arrived at Aunt Chiladas and were immediately greeted by a young dapper server named Connor. Upon being seated in a cozy corner facing a pond with two lively ducks, we were brought an excess of warm chips and refreshing salsa. Our server Connor, who I might add was speedy, charming, and friendly, recommended us margaritas and in the blink of an eye they were bestowed upon us like mana from the heavens. During our meal, Connor also brought us different salsas to try out. After our tongues were seared with the intangible and unrelenting pain of ghost peppers, Connor brought us milk without even being asked to. Throughout our meal he was extremely attentive and even gave an excellent demonstration of how to prepare authentic guacamole. Thank you for the great service, we will definitely  be going again soon and sitting in Connor's section."}
{"text":"The kids decided this was \"Meh-xican\" food. I have to agree that it was just OK. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but the food was pretty bland; even the jalapeños lacked bite.  I'd read other reviews to beware that the salsa here was spicier than at most places -- I've got to say that was definitely NOT my experience. I don't know if they've gotten complaints and default to a mild version for the tourists, but ours was little more than tomato sauce with a few onions in it.  On the plus side, the kids absolutely LOVED their cheese crisps."}
{"text":"Great location because onsite at the resort.  Service so so.  Chips not good. Salsa fresh.  Street tacos - chicken not good. Steak good.   Queso dip ...not a hit."}
{"text":"Went with friends for lunch last week. I've never been- the atmosphere is fun, the place is huge and has an large outdoor seating area. Its like a Macayos on steroids. Anyway, the food was good, and the service would good also. Except for when my friend wanted a simple substitution. Before we know it, 10 minutes have gone by, I've had an entire conversation about something else with the 3rd person in our party and another staff person was brought over. One of my friends called ordering lunch \"negotiating\". The poor guy gave up and ordered something else entirely. It was good, it was just a weird experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch so we missed the crowd. There were a good amount of cars in the parking lot, but service wasn't bad. Heard terrible things about the place but had to try it for myself. Sat out on the patio under an umbrella. Nice if you don't mind the resident ducks staring you down for chips. They don't bother that much if you don't feed em. Ordered a grande strawberry margarita. Very good. The salsa wasn't anything special but the chips were fresh. Ordered the 2 enchilada plate with rice and beans, one chx one shredded beef. She order a chx burrito. It took longer than we expected to get the food out but was good and filling. Spendy though for 2 plates and 3 grande margaritas ~$70. I'd go back."}
{"text":"The rice is fluffy, the salsa is perfectly mild, the green corn tamale is wonderful. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I dined here once on a date. Needless to say, the date that evening went south. Anyhow, I found the service here average and the time to receive our meal was unusually long -like 20 minutes. The food was fairly bland and not very flavorful and the chips and tortillas seemed to not be very fresh. However, the one redeeming factor is their quesadillas are huge and they don't skimp on the cheese.   This place is fairly average and you won't impress any dates here. But if you need some Mexican food near Arizona Mills, it's alright."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the WORST food I have ever eaten.  The owner and chef should be embarrassed about the lack of quality food they are serving.   I ate their last night with some co-workers and the queso was thick and over cooked, similar to what the queso looks like at the bottom of a crock pot.  I order enchiladas and a taco.  They brought me a shredded taco instead of a ground beef taco so I sent it back. When the new taco arrived and I went to take a bite the shell was stale.  I immediately spit it out lost my appetite and had to go home hungry.  I would have rather gone across the street to Burger King then eat that food."}
{"text":"I had such a lovely experience at this restaurant with my friend. We enjoyed the food so much! The Chicken Tortilla Soup was delicious. The traditional chicken burrito was huge and so delicious! I am not sure what the sauce was that I had on it but it was wonderful! I don't normally drink but the drinks we had were quite delicious too. The waiter was lovely. The atmosphere was terrific. I hope to visit Arizona again and eat there again!"}
{"text":"2 words: not good. The mexican food here is as far from authentic as you can get, plus it is overpriced. I got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop. Then I got a taco and tostada and both were of lower standards than taco bell (I would have preferred a taco bell taco). When I go to a Mexican restaurant in Arizona I expect a freshly fried taco shell, not your store bought Ortega brand taco shell and I expect shredded beef, but at Aunt Chilada's you get the store bought shells and ground beef! I won't return."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible!  Not related (for a very long time, apparently, to the other one with the same name in north Phoenix). Oops. Wish I'd found that out before agreeing to be seated.  Friendly, enough, staff.   Strange layout. We were seated in what looked to have formerly been an outdoor area. It's a separate building. Once seated, we were forgotten for close to 20 minutes.  Finally chips, salsa and waters arrived. Decent salsa.  The beef was not referred to as \"steak\" for any of their selections. Might have been a subtle tip that the meat quality is off. And, that's polite. Was it even beef? Not sure. Where was it cut from? The serving staff didn't know when asked and didn't seem inclined to go find out.  It was so bad that more than 3/4ths of the meals were left uneaten. No \"to go\" boxes. No thank you. Eew. Take it away! And, no interest in going for a dessert. Every good meal deserves a dessert to cap it off, right?  North Phoenix, here I come."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance and wonderful colorful patio. I judge all Mexican restaurants by their chili rellenos, and this one was a winner. Very fresh and flavorful. The service was attentive and helpful. The most exciting discovery was on the dessert menu. They have sopapillas!!!!! Having grown up eating the Mexican/New Mexican food in Colorado and New Mexico sopapillas were a special part of every meal. I was shocked when I found that California and Arizona do not follow that fabulous tradition. Hence, my 20+ year quest to find good sopapillas without having to drive to Santa Fe. To say I am delighted to find them 5 miles from my home is an understatement. For those unfamiliar, a sopapilla is a flaky piece of fried bread, puffed up into a pillow just perfect for drizzling honey inside. The sopapillas here were perfect. This makes a return visit to Aunt Child's a necessity. Treat yourself to great food and finish with the sopapillas!!!"}
{"text":"The appetizer platter we received was really good. Me and my husband enjoyed that. We also got chicken fitijas and was definitely not impressed but it. There was no flavor at all in the plate. Other than that it was okay. Would we eat again. Maybe. We were celebrating our 1 year anniversary so we tried it out"}
{"text":"I think the food was OK. Not great, but a cute little place. But the five stars is for our server, Lucero, an absolutely lovely gem of a young lady.   Additionally, we were also pleased with the attentiveness of the other server, Kyle.    The best part of a restaurant experience is the service staff and  I hope that the management of this establishment rewards them appropriately and does their best to retain and reward such talent."}
{"text":"I really like this place. One of the better Mexican restaurants in the valley. They have great food and their prices weren't outrageous. I sat outside right by a heater... it was heaven. The service was good. Our food was brought out to us right away, but the waiter neglected to notice our empty drink cups. I understand it was busy, and he looked like he was the only one outside at the time, but we were thirsty! All in all, I was satisfied. After we eat there, we usually go and sit up on South Mountain and watch the city lights and walk off the food, lol."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars. The black beans and rice were very good, but my entree - the chile relleno - was lacking. It was smothered in delicious cheese and the fried breading was just ok. I'm not sure what the pepper was stuffed with, but it didn't really taste like anything.   I ordered the Patron margarita with liqueur and lime juice  because I dislike the house kind that comes from a mix, but this one still didn't taste 100% homemade (like they cut it with a little mix or something). The chips and salsa were just ok.   This place is nice for it's convenient location next to the Arizona Grand, but I was a little disappointed by my visit. Good I suppose if you want very Americanized Mexican fare."}
{"text":"This was our first meal when we arrived in the Phoenix area. The food was decent and the margaritas were pretty awesome. We sat on the patio on a beautiful day so we will be back for that alone. The service was good, but a little slow so I wouldn't want to dine here is I was in a hurry. My chili rellano was awesome, but my daughter was not crazy about the shredded beef enchiladas. We also ordered the bean dip, which was a little cold but decent. All in all an ok meal."}
{"text":"Showed up with a party of 5 at 7pm on a Tuesday night.  Was seated promptly and got chips and salsa quickly.  After 20 minutes no server showed up.  Went to hostess that seated us and told her.  No apology just turned to the back and left me standing there.  After another 10 minutes of eating chips and salsa we decided to leave.  Passing the hostess I told her that we were going somewhere else to eat.  She smiled sweetly and told me to have a nice evening.  I asked to speak to a manager.  Manager made no apology but did explain that the server in my area was new but wouldn't be around for long.  I asked what good that would do me now.  She said no good.  Worst experience ever!  Have been going here with visitors for years and have never been treated so poorly.  No one apologized but I guess someone would have to care  before apologizing."}
{"text":"I had the green chile burrito and I kid you not, it looked like dog food. Came close to tasting like it as well. Not authentic Mexican food at all, if you want Americanized Mexican food then maybe but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by one night for dinner and was seated immediately.  I was somewhat disappointed with the menu which was heavy on cheese and fried stuff.  I would have loved to have seen a mole dish. on the menu.  I ended up with the Southwestern Caesar Salad (super tasty dressing), which was okay.  I would not come back again if I were in town again.  I'd try the Sonoran hot dog cart on the corner of Baseline and Priest instead."}
{"text":"Went for Cinco de Mayo drinks and was totally underwhelmed. It wasn't that busy, but the service was horrifically slow, the chips tasted stale, there was no music, and they overcharged us for happy hour drinks.   They get an extra star since their salsa and margarita's were decent though. I'd agree with the other reviewers here that this place is just okay. There are certainly better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I went there last night for dinner with friends. It's a HUUUGE place...doesn't look that big from the outside, but it's a sprawling establishment. Around 6:30 on a Thursday, they were running full. I would have loved to sit outside on the patio because the weather was so perfect, but we just opted for the first available seats, which were inside. My friend was hungry, so she ordered the Aunt Chilada dip (refried beans, sour cream, guac, and ground beef), and some drinks from the bar. Nothing stellar so far. The waitress came to take our orders as soon as we sat down. I got the Tacos de Pescado, my friends got flautas and tamales. We got salsa and chips to start with. The order came really fast, while we were still finishing our starters. I liked my tacos, though I wish the fish was a little more flavorful and spicy. I added lemon juice liberally and salsa, which made up for the blandness somewhat. My friends said their food was good, though far from authentic. I give three stars to this place mostly because of its ambience. I wish the waitresses would give diners more time at the table though..i felt a tad rushed. But maybe that was because of the crowd. Yeah, I can sure go back here again."}
{"text":"It's not great... but it's not awful. A little overpriced for mediocre food. Love the spinach enchiladas. If you're in the area and there's nowhere else close by you want to travel for Mexican, it will do."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time about a week ago and it was awesome! It was kind of slow for a weeknight but service and food were great, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We stumbled upon it after arriving from out of town.  The waiter we had was wonderful, the food was awesome and the atmosphere was also pleasant.  Too bad they're associated with the Arizona Grand."}
{"text":"The food is edible, but not good. I have been there a few times and have always sat outside which is a nice patio area.  However, a nice patio does not overcome the bland food and mediocre service. You are in Arizona, there is much better Mexican food to be eaten."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and was not impressed, although the service was great. Our waitress was friendly and easily split our check for the 6 of us at the table paying separately. There is no lunch menu so the prices were $11-18 per meal. The chips and salsa were delicious but the meal left more to be desired. I got the chicken tostada with refried beans and rice. The chicken was pretty bland and the rice and beans were just okay. I probably would only be back if they offered lunch prices or happy hour."}
{"text":"The happy hour in the bar is amazing. The best deals I ever seen. From 3-4, $3.00 wine and appetizers, certain well drinks and beer too at $3.00, from 4-5, prices go to $4.00, etc.  Clare is the best bartender since the TV show Cheers. Oh and the Pinot Grigio there is sublime.  Do NOT NOT miss the bean dip.  Dinner there is amazing. I had the Mexican Ceasar salad with mesquite grilled shrimp on it and a side of Fideo, the only place in town that has Fideo. They could cook it like crap if they wanted to but they don't love love love Aunt Chiladas! pictures on Instram @lidsamy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Coming from Texas & eating tons of Mexican food.. this place beats all of it!"}
{"text":"So in love with the queso dip. I could have jist eaten that all night long.  We were told Wait time was 40 min. But we got seated after only 15 min. Woot Woot! The shredded chicken tacos were legit"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is just not good.  Went there for lunch and first off the chips and salsa were terrible. The salsa tasted worse than pace from a grocery store jar. Then came my \"taco salad\".  I asked if instead of meat I could have refried beans. Okay, so my $13 \"taco salad\" consisted of a shell with iceburg lettuce and a ladel full of refried beans on the top. That's it. Yeah. That's it.  Oh, I did get some sour cream and guac on the side of the plate, but no tomtatoes in the salad, not even a little onion or garnish or anything. Just iceberg lettuce and refried beans poured on top. It was gross!!  And it was $13 dollars!!  Give me a break.  My husband ordered a black bean chimichanga. The beans were soggy and refried style black beans, no flavor or spice, totally boring. The food was seriously terrible and ridiculously expensive. We spent over $30 on that crappy crap of a terrible lunch and will never go back there."}
{"text":"If you want slow service & decent food for an expensive price this is the place to go! Food was decent but there's better places for less money. Try popos fiesta Del sol."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide where to eat.   Must eat.  Driving in circles.  Must eat.  Want to run over the first a-hole that comes between me and food.  Found this place by mistake.  Family was too hungry to be picky and could not take the 2 seconds to look it up on Yelp.  So we went off the grid.  The service was friendly and attentive.  At one point, they made a mistake and brought our table a second beer.  Which they gave to us, for making the mistake.  Don't get me wrong, I was going to give them a good review anyway, the free beer was just icing on the cake.  The food was very fresh.  Right down to the chips and salsa.  I certainly think that it could  have used more heat, but I feel the same way about water.  I was craving some Chile Verde, so went with the pork.  Not what I had expected.  I was thinking pork marinaded in green sauce.  It was grilled pork fillets that were seasoned to perfection.  It was outstanding.  The Fajita plate had a little more heat, not nearly enough for me, but plenty for my wife.    Kids had quasadilla and were treated like kings.  I highly recommend this place.  Great atmosphere, great food and most importantly a moat around the front."}
{"text":"I ate here as part of a work function.  They have amazing chips and salsa.  That was probably the best part of my meal.  I love Mexican food and could eat it literally every day - but I found this to be a very very Americanized version of Mexican food.  It was \"Eh\" - not bad, not great...just \"Eh\". The best part of the meal were the chips, they were delicious and the salsa was amazing.  I like spicy food and the salsa delivered - but everything else was so mild and just forgetable. There were a lot of us in the group and our food kept coming out in waves.  The first batch of people served started eating and were more than half way done their meal by the time the third wave was served.  I believe our large group plus the large number of diners that were already there very likely overwhelmed the kitchen staff.  We had a reservation, perhaps they could have scheduled a few more people.  The server herself was good, she was on the spot with drinks, refills and more chips.  I don't know how much the bill was because the check was picked up by my boss, but if I were paying for dinner, I don't know that I would come back here if other options were available."}
{"text":"Why so many bad reviews? This place was yummy! My guy and I just had lunch there (Him- steak & shrimp fajitas Me-Burro Verde) everything was good, both food & service. Glad we ignored some bad reviews & tried it :)"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here, locals brought me.  Now I go every time I'm in town, and if my niece who lives here is available she joins me. I recommend the beef enchiladas, with charro style  beans and rice. Chili relleno is as good, I order both!"}
{"text":"I went here while on lunch this past Friday with a co-worker. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised with their items on their menu. I ordered the 2 shredded chicken enchiladas with black beans and rice & it was delicious! The portions were really big! My coworker also ordered 2 enchiladas, one cheese one shredded chicken & she also said they were really good. Her sides she chose were rice & fidello. I was surprised to notice that they offered fidello, she said it was really good.  I was most excited that I only paid about $16.00 with a drink & $4.00 for a tip, so total of $20 for really good food, great service & VERY LARGE portions. I would recommend this place to others. They have a nice patio area where you can sit outside & there is a man made pond, which was very nice. They also offer happy hour daily so thats a plus!"}
{"text":"Its amazing how much they are charging for their flavorless greasy food. I was so underwhelmed I felt obligated to write this here review, which is also appropriately underwhelming. The best thing about the meal was the iced tea. Oh, I guess the service was decent."}
