{"text":"I just ordered food for delivery online.  the website was easy to use and prices are fair. delivery charge is $2 and with one entree and two sides the bill was less that $20 and fed me and my boyfriend with some leftovers in the fridge for later! i got the orange chicken and ordered it medium spicy.  next time i will absolutely go hot.  the taste is good and sweet but not spicy at all.  i will also ask for the chicken to be cooked a little longer, as a personal preference.  i got 2 spring rolls which are tasty and the crab puffs.  the crab puffs come in a generous portion and there is a lot of meat inside each one with a great taste to it.  I was unhappy with the bread on the outside however, it seemed more chewy and hard than the nice crunch that i was after.  The order came correct, on time, and hot with all of the condiments requested.  I wouldn't get the crab puffs again but i will try some other items from the menu."}
{"text":"I came home from work the other day and I found a pamphlet hanging on my door from a new local restaurant called \"The Tasty House\"  Their menu is very impressive.  They have a very large selection on there all separated into appropriate categories which make it easy to read.  \"Chicken\" \"Chow-Mein and Lo-Mein, Seafood\" etc.  As I browsed the menu and looked over at the prices, I really was interested...but alas, the Tasty House would have to wait.  Several weeks later and a lot of convincing later -- I finally managed to visit the Tasty House on a warm Saturday afternoon (11/6/2010) for lunch and here are my impressions:  Location: From where *I* live, the location is perfect.  Located in the \"hole-in-the-wall\" area of around 15th Ave. and Bell Rd. it's only about 5 minutes from my house, but I digress.  The Tasty House really is a small hole in the wall business.  I really enjoy these types of places and my wife and I secretly search for these \"gems\" and try desperately to discover something we can rave about and enjoy eating for years to come.  Interior / Ambiance: This leaves a little bit to be desired.  But...understandably.  You don't look at a menu and see an entire pint of egg flower soup for $2.50 and expect the interior to be \"top notch\" -- and I will level with everyone when I say it's kind of a dive.  The chairs and tables are very beautiful and brand new, but the walls, ceiling, floor, and ambiance is that of an old beat down used up building with some generic Chinese wall-hangs attempting to give some decor to the otherwise plain walls.  Hopefully they can make some money and they can spice it up -- it could really be a delicious intimate restaurant.  The Service: Here is where they got knocked an entire star.  Don't get me wrong:  I appreciate that people could be at work tired, maybe they are not feeling well, maybe they are just having a \"Bad Day\" but my wife and I are an up-beat young couple and we walked into the Tasty House with high hopes to get some delicious Chinese food....  We were not greeted.  No one said Hello.  In fact, let me paint a picture of what we saw:  Nothing.  The entire place looked empty, except for a teenage Chinese boy who had on a pair of headphones and looked like he was actually sleeping in the corner while reading the paper.  Our guess is that he was a delivery guy and he had no orders so he was resting.  Sounds fine to us.  After a few minutes the beautiful young girl came to greet us and take our order.  Rather than try and re-create her attitude via text in a written review, I will simply say that she was NOT happy to be there, and she did not seem happy serving us or taking our order.  That's all I will say -- she could have smiled, once, or at least been happy to give us our food or *something* -- I actually felt BAD for her.  I wanted to help her, like maybe she was ringing people up under gunpoint or she was secretly some type of a waitress hostage.  We didn't really tip, but it wasn't really a \"wait on us\" situation...  The Food: The food was amazing.  I ordered the spicy Szechuan chicken with steamed rice and an egg roll.  My wife ordered the sesame chicken with steamed rice and an egg roll.  We both drank water so it only cost us $10.88 -- seriously.  For lunch.  In Phoenix.  VERY good value.  After a few moments the unhappy girl delivered to our table the most delicious spicy chicken szechuan piled high with delicious crisp vegetables.  I loved every bite.  The Egg roll was nuclear hot and went well with the complimentary sweet and sour sauce and duck sauce.  My wife's Sesame chicken was also very delicious -- although she says it had too much sauce on it, but she tends to like things bland.  It had a great mix of savory and sweet delicious flavor and seemed perfect to me.   The Price: $10.88 for two people for lunch is great, especially with the portions and how delicious is was.  Well worth it, and I highly recommend it to people for lunch or even dinner (dinner prices are about 2-6 more, depending on what you order)... so you could get out of there for probably $14-18 for dinner.   The Verdict:  I would definitely give Tasty House another try.  The food was good enough and delicious and the price was right for me to investigate this as another option.  My only change:  I am going to do Take Out so I just have to pick it up, pay,and go home to eat it."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to see so many one star reviews. This is where we order from often. When we first started to order from here 6 months ago their average review was 4-4.5 stars. The Black Pepper Chicken is amazing and is usually what we get. It is very quick and easy to order online. Hope you give this place a chance despite these reviews!"}
{"text":"Wow! Very impressed!  I just moved to a new apartment recently and took a chance on this place for delivery.  I used the online order option and was quoted 45 - 60 minutes for delivery.  My order arrived in less than 30 minutes, hot, and delicious!  I order sweet and sour shrimp, crab puffs and shrimp fried rice.  The order before the tip was $20 and well worth it since it was easily enough for 2 people!  The shrimp was packaged separate from the sauce so it wasn't soggy and the crab puffs are the best.  Will definitely stay with this option!"}
{"text":"Great food for a hole in the wall Asian restaurant. The reviews on here that express a very late delivery are most likely referring to ordering through GrubHub. I used to drive for GrubHub and let me tell you it is a crap company. Everytime my husband and I have ordered delivery through the actual restaurant, delivery has been phenomenal. Anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, which is pretty standard for delivery in this area. I love their sweet and sour chicken. Probably the best I've had from this quality of restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a dish specifically without mushrooms because I am allergic.  I called the restaurant to try and rectify the situation and they told me they refuse to do anything about it, and that I've just wasted my money, and then they hung up on me.  I proceeded to call back and they hung up on me 3 more times.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.  They stole my money, and they will not fix anything if you have an issue with your order.  Absolutely horrid customer service.  The worst customer service I have ever received from a restaurant and that's saying a lot.  The owner used racial slurs in referring to me as 'white devil muddafakka;"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was just last night or what, but the food was gross. The crab puffs tasted like the filling was expired. The fried rice had raw onions, and the rice was dry. The spring rolls were soggy. My fianc√© didn't even eat his chicken fried rice, At All, and over half of mine is in the fridge not going to be eaten.. We wasted $35 on really poor quality food. And the delivery driver almost walked off with my change ($7). I won't order here again."}
{"text":"I order from this place at least once a week and have it delivered. Every time it's been really good especially for take-out. It's also fresh and the Pu-Pu Tray is actually still hot when I get it."}
{"text":"I have order from this restaurant quite a bit since moving to this section of Phoenix.  However after this last order this will be my last order, unless I am desperate or intoxicated.  Why? Because when I called back to inform the restaurant that the order was wrong, the gentlemen that answered the phone lectured me on how to order. Then the delivery person that brought my corrected order back to my home continued to lecture me also, this is no way to treat a customer or to ensure repeat patronage.  So, I'm done with \"Tasty House\" and have a nice day."}
{"text":"The food and delivery here are very good!!  I didn't buy into some of the 1-star reviews here and glad I didn't!  The food and service here is very good!  Delivery time was 22 minutes.  Food is hot and tasty.  My boys and I ordered Sweet n Sour Chicken, Shrimp with snow peas, and Gen. Tso's Chicken.  All were excellent!  We have no connection with this place, just a real customer who wants to give nearby small businesses a chance... in spite of the many dubious 1-star ratings here.    Don't let the rating scare you.  Someone (probably another nearby Chinese delivery joint) is wrongfully trying to bash it."}
{"text":"Well i give them one star - didn't get my order delivered because \"I live to far\". They took the order and knew the address, it's within the boundaries of their menu delivery map. But would you believe she called me back 15 minutes later and said - oh i check GPS you too far you come pick up order. If i wanted a carry out I would of ordered it and picked it up. I ordered for delivery. Really?  Obviously she didn't care when she hung up on me. Pass - have had carryout before and can't say it was great - shame - another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"Wow, shockingly bad food. Recieved a menu on our door and thought we'd try it out. First and last time eating at (not so) Tasty House.  Would rather run a $50 bill through my shredder than eat this food.  Lady who took the phone order was relatively unpleasant. Food arrived very quickly and order was accurate. I now think it arrived so quickly because they only use a microwave and deep fat fryer. I don't think they own a wok or saute pan, the food was tasteless and colorless. I don't think the fried rice was actually fried, it looked and tasted like white rice with a dash of say for coloring, but not actually fried. Everything was bland, there was no flavor developed in any of the dishes. The pork slices tasted like they had been freezerburned, yuck. I am pretty sure this is the worst chinese food I have eaten in my 43 years.  I'm sticking with Dragon Bowl down the street."}
{"text":"Over last 6 moths had their food 8-9 times and always no complaints. On delivery always laugh they say 45 minutes and they show up 20-25 minutes later. Good food not bad price only wish they could make something spicy enough for me."}
{"text":"I was at discount tire across the parking lot and since I'm pregnant I was feeling hungry and needed to grab a little something to eat. I was told I had to order more food in order to sit in their establishment. The food was not that great and Panda Express is better than this joint. If your thinking of sitting down to enjoy a small meal, think again. Horrible customer service and I will never return to this place even if it was the last place on earth. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"At 1 P.M. on a Tuesday, I was greeted just inside the front door by the remnants of a previous diner's lunch, which didn't have quite the same appeal as those rubber food replicas formerly displayed by Japanese restaurants in more cosmopolitan cities.    Making my way past clean but empty tables and booths to the counter, I was almost greeted by the woman seated there who was shelling and munching what looked like black beans while watching Chinese soaps online. It used to be just a radio; isn't tech grand? Except, of course, when it coughs up 70 MILLION sets of personal information to hackers. I say \"almost greeted\" because as she looked up with a  half-smile to acknowledge me, my attention was diverted by the appearance of who I'll assume was the designated order taker. She offered a similar warmth and was extremely efficient in taking my pre-considered menu choice. Good Service-Check. Good vibe-Check.    With my lunch special take-away in hand in less than 5 minutes, things were off to a great start, and  with the spicy aroma filling the cab of the trusty Ranger pickup,my expectations were in line with the reviews I'd read.    My litmus test for valley Chinese is Pork with Garlic Sauce, although, in order to avoid any \"no substitution\" controversy, I went with the chicken, as shown on the chicken-heavy menu. (limited lunch special version)     In the 90's, it was Hong Kong Gourmet House on McDowell, with their garlic sauce being dark,complex,rich, and delicious; amid rave reviews by co-workers I'd favored with a taste.    Tasty House, you missed the mark by a mile. While the veggies were indeed truly fresh and colorful and generous, where was the \"Tasty\"? The spicy aroma I mentioned earlier had departed completely, as though it had been sprayed inside the bag for effect. Everything, including the frighteningly pale chicken, was steamed, not seeing a wok at all, where the melding of flavors is supposed to occur.    Yes, you have a selection of steamed offerings, but that's not what I ordered or expected. Where is the sear on the chick? Where is the tender-crisp to the veggies, instead of the\" 3 seconds past raw\" you presented?  Add to that a weak,sweet, uninspired \"garlic sauce\" acting as merely an overlay, rather than a component of a whole, and you just lost me. The red pepper flakes showing in the thin sauce failed to merit the \"Hot\" designation on the menu.    The Pork Fried Rice had all the right ingredients but was dry and devoid of the smoky infusion only a properly hot wok can impart.     Based on previous reviews, I'd guess Tasty House can put out some satisfactory dishes. And yes, everything was notably fresh. I'm just tired of having to make concessions to people I'm giving my money to.    Quality,portion, price - all good    Correct preparation, inspirational sauces - not this time."}
{"text":"Old school hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. I have been here now dozen times. Always fresh and hot. Good portion sizes and dishes that are battered or breaded are never over breaded or soggy. The younger girl who is usually up front is a little rude but I think it's her age. The more times I have been there the friendlier she has become. Dinning area is clean but cluttered with junk and 2 litter sodas. If it was for the decor and the girl I'd give this place a 5."}
{"text":"So I'm kinda pissed. Me and my fianc√© order from her frequently, we order the same thing as always. Sweet and sour chicken, broccoli beef, and the pupu tray. Tonight's was terrible. All fried foods were burnt. The spare ribs were burnt and old. His S&S chicken was mainly breading. My beef and broccoli had a wierd taste to it. The ragoons had a overly seafood taste to it. I wish the issue wasn't just the food. Delivery driver called telling us he was outside yet was no where to be found by the front office. When I called he was like oh darn that GPS.. he was 15 minutes away. We finished \"eating\" like 45 minutes ago and I already wanna puke my brains out. I'm seriously pissed off. I want my money back."}
{"text":"Hot and Sour soup was tasty with tons of mushrooms. The General Tso's tofu was good and the veggie lo men was on the money. Delivery was wicked fast. Definitely will order from them when I come back into town."}
{"text":"Service was great when I called in a delivery order. I was able to understand the girl on the other side of the phone much better than when I normally call a decent Asian food place. Much appreciated.  Food got here in 30 minutes instead of 45. Orange chicken was tasty & crispy. Subgum wonton soup broth is slightly bland but perfect after I added a lil rooster sauce &  is full of veggies & wonton & chicken n pork n shrimp. Very satisfying. We got adventurous & ordered the veggie chow mein fun. It's delicious!  Perfectly tasty. Not salty or bland & veggies cooked barely tender. I really enjoyed this meal"}
{"text":"GAH-ROSS!!!  If I could give negative stars I would. We order out frequently (Yes, I can cook but I'm also a Mom and sometimes I just don't wanna). We have used Grub Hub lots and usually fairly happy. Food isn't always terrific but edible.   NOT TONIGHT.   We ordered from Tasty cuz the hubs has been craving Chinese  (and I'm on a diet so I've been resisting). We ordered typical order (General Tsaos, egg rolls, fried rice). I have to say, I've ordered from, and been to, many restaurants and always give the benefit of the doubt.   This place is HORRIBLE! The General Tsaos was not only burnt, but there was literally NO chicken.   The egg rolls? Inedible.   And, just to pour salt on the wound...no dipping sauce for the egg rolls (NONE) and one...ONE...fortune cookie for a party of three (lame, I know..but seriously?).   I kid you not...our dogs who will eat ANYTHING,  would not eat this. We tried. If you want proof I will video them with the disgusting left overs.   Trust me...do not order from here. You'd be better off driving to your closest Panda Express.   And they won't even answer their phones to give us a refund, to boot. Seriously....how are these people still in business?"}
{"text":"Decent food, but this is the worst run business I've encountered in a while.  My order took an hour and a half to get here and when it finally arrived, my food was leaking.  I called after an hour in to check on the status, and the woman seemed completely annoyed with me, simply repeating, \"We're on the way.\"  When I called to tell her they forgot to include something after I received my order, she actually yelled at me.  Steer clear."}
{"text":"Great food very fresh. Quick service. Best Chinese/take out we have had. Very high quality restaurant food!"}
{"text":"Being new to this area, and not completely moved in we have the opportunity to try out many locations for eating out this month. We typically do not like to visit the \"corporate\" locations, and go for mom and pop type restaurants.   We found this place on Yelp and thought we would give it a try. While their website is not the most up to date or the greatest, they do have an online menu which is great because many Chinese or Japanese type restaurants do not have an online menu. We ordered (easy) and we were told it would be delivered in 45 minutes. This was on a Friday night so we were pretty excited with the delivery time.  Food was here within an hour which was still good for a Friday night. We ordered honey chicken with white rice, Chicken Lo Mein, Chicken Fried Rice, Egg Drop Soup, crab and cream cheese wantons, one Pork Egg roll,  and free with our order from an online coupon was Sweet and Sour Chicken.  When our food arrived, they had forgot the white rice. When we called they were very nice about it and said they were so busy that it would be an hour before they could get some back to us. They did give us a free order for the next time we order from them.  Honey chicken- Good but needed rice with it. (would not order again) Chicken Lo Mein - Husband said it was just ok Chicken Fried Rice- I loved it! Was very good!  Egg Drop Soup- My son said it was his favorite, my husband said it was alright (not as good as PF Changs) Crab and cream cheese wantons- I had only one, they were too cream cheesy for me one Pork Egg roll- husband said it was ok Sweet and Sour chicken- My son liked dipping it in the sauce, again would have been better with the rice.  I liked the restaurant and that they delivered quickly. My husband said he was not that impressed with the food. It was CHEAP and good for the price and delivery. I will eat there again (especially since I have a free dish from there!)!"}
{"text":"I like this place because you can order online and the food is good.  No filler vegetables in the won ton soup and General Tso's chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"The honey chicken tasted like it was friend in old oil and the teriyaki chicken was super sweet and fatty."}
{"text":"I really hate to give poor reviews but I was very disappointed with this place tonight. We ordered on a Saturday evening and were told it would be an hour for delivery (busy night). The order showed up 90 minutes later; we almost just left the house and let the order go (that would have been better). The delivery kid knew it was WAY past acceptable for a 30 minute late delivery (not his fault I'm sure)... in fact he handed over the order, apologized and then ran back to his car.  We ordered pork egg rolls, crab puffs, sweet and sour chicken and chef's special chicken. Both the egg rolls and the crab puffs were cold, the crab puffs were overly fishy (we decided to dump for fear of them having gone bad), the chicken dishes were both just deep fried chicken bits and they each just had a side sauce to pour over them...for a house specialty item it was pretty much Panda Express (no offense Panda - you do good fast food). But for the price we paid, about $30 plus tip it was totally not worth it.  It's a sad day indeed and I'm still hungry :("}
{"text":"DON'T' DO IT! I ordered this through Grub hub and it took an 1 1/2 hours to get our food, and when it finally got here the food was disgusting. Everything was covered in old grease with a nasty under taste.  It tasted like the cook sneaks into the walk in to smoke cigarettes... I'm not even sure there is real meat in the fried rice. YUCK! I will NOT be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall Chinese fast food spot with some \"tasty\" options. Tofu dishes for veggie heads too!  Ryan C described this place perfectly, so check out his review ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-house-chinese-restaurant-phoenix#hrid:dPH4TU9Ys-04gmbkYPj5Yg ) to get a good picture of what this place is like.  I dropped in for lunch today and was also impressed by the $5 lunch specials. Unfortunately, they had zero tofu dishes available on the lunch special menu (there are 3 or so tofu dishes on the dinner menu). I inquired about this fact and they hooked me up with a custom tofu dish lunch special deal! Now that's good customer service!  I got the tofu with vegetables dish, which is some tasty thinly sliced tofu, deep fried and doused in a ameri-chino sauce. A selection of vegetables is also tossed in, with white rice and a veggie eggroll finishing off the dish. All this for $5.XX! Noice!  I really dug their tofu dish and the low prices. I'll be back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Worse Chinese food I have EVER tasted. The only good seafood they had was the shrimp. The white rice was so dry that not even the soy sauce could save it. The octopus was slimy and rubbery, the scallops weren't cooked properly either. The delivery guy even had the nerve to ask for a tip despite the fact I gave him a dollar as a tip already. This place was so overplayed. Did not enjoy my meal. Don't ever order delivery from this place because apparently they don't care enough, and are rude."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I've recently moved to Phoenix from So. Cal. and was really missing some good Chinese Food. This place is right next door so we thought we would try it out. They deliver, so that was pretty convenient, but my food was disgusting. I ordered orange chicken, pretty basic, if a Chinese food joint and can't make good orange chicken, I doubt any of the other dishes are any good. The sauce on my chicken was neon orange, almost glowing. It was just disgusting. Too Sweet, slimy and just gross."}
{"text":"I order here quite often, the food is good and cheap and the delivery is always on time or earlier! I love the egg drop soup, and crab puffs. The delivery guy forgot my side of rice and they gave me a small soup instead of a large, but when I called they appoloized and 15 min later dropped off my missing items, no problem. Definitely a great place for when you don't have time to cook and want something hassle free!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice. First time was our first night in Arizona; my boyfriend and I were tired, starving, and smelly. I ordered the sesame chicken dinner special and crab puffs. Boy, they both hit the spot and it all was the right amount of food--not too much, not too little.  The second time I ordered the same thing, but the quality sucked. The breading was soggy, and the container was barely full. Also the eggrolls are nasty but they gave me one instead of the drink that I asked for on the phone. When I asked, \"may I have my drink?\" the girl (who didn't take the order) said, \"You can only have an eggroll or a drink. You got an eggroll\" *points to bag*. And that was that.    I'm not going back except in a time of desperation or intoxication."}
{"text":"What the heck? I have not written a review for this place yet? WOW! I will say this is my go to place for Chinese food when I am craving it and not wanting to drive to one of my favorite spots especially since it is less than 5 mins away from my house. I was CRAVING some chinese last night so I decided to order some pork Lo Mein, crab and cheese wontons and hot and sour soup. OMG, that was the best Lo Mein I have had in a long time. Either that or I was seriously hungry which I wasn't. I ended up eating all of it was is very unusual for me. I was saving the hot and sour soup to have for dinner to day and I must say I was slightly disappointed as I tasted it and it was not as spicy as I would have liked. I order this soup extra spicy all the time, especially when I am not feeling well. So I had to doctor it up in the hopes that it will be nice and spicy for me later.   If you are in the area, give this place a try. I seriously do enjoy the food here and the girls are always nice to me. Next time I will order in person (for my hot and sour soup at least) so that they it is me (they always laugh when I order it extra, extra, spicy) but hey it is a great cure for colds!"}
{"text":"Tasty House has great food &reasonable prices. We usually order for delivery, but I was picking up food for a family member today.   Their delivery service is grub hub so it takes a hour or so, so allow for the time, If your starving, you may want to pick at restaurant because it takes only 15 minutes.  Overall, Tasty House has great food, reasonably priced & deliver on time & friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a month trip to Arizona, got those Chinese food cravings and I'm so glad I found this place. The food is way better here than in Philly!! This restaurant is a diamond in the rough. Seriously, do not expect much from a generic Chinese restaurant. If you want gourmet food, go somewhere else to eat.   I tried out the hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, chicken lo mein and orange chicken. The hot and sour soup was thick and spicy, better to drink it once you get it! Oh gosh, never have I found an egg drop soup that wasn't watery until now, thank goodness for that. It's better if you eat the food inside the restaurant because the soups would be terrible if you drink them mildly warm or cold. The manager is super nice and creates conversations with you as well.  Out of all the other Chinese food places that I tried, the chicken lo mein and the orange chicken here was the best! Normally they would either be too bland or too salty, but this place was just right. Arizona doing it right!"}
{"text":"I usually order from this restaurant through an app on my phone called Grub Hub. This restaurant recently was sold and has new owners/management. Since that time, I have noticed an improvement on the quality of the food/dishes and the customer service is vastly improved. We like the Mongolian Beef, Broccoli and Beef, Orange Chicken, Szechuan Beef, honey wings, and the Pu Pu Platter.  Everything we have ordered has been delicious, hot,  and fresh. Oftentimes our family has leftovers for the next day. The food is just as good the second time around.  We will definitely be returning customers to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Chinese restaurant that has really good food. I was disappointed, to say the least, that my search is not over. Tonight I ordered egg drop soup, plain lo mein, and sesame chicken.  I'll start with the egg drop soup- this was the best part of the meal. It was rather more yellow than other egg drop soups I have had, but the crispy noodles complimented it.  The plain lo mein noodles had potential to be really delicious. However, they were very very (I mean VERY) greasy.  The sesame chicken I have to say was the most disappointing part of this meal. I tore apart probably 10 pieces looking for the chicken. I only received an order of fried batter in sesame sauce :(  I also found it strange that the restaurant sign did not light up out front. I would have totally missed this place if it weren't for the small \"open\" light up sign at the door. There were no other cars or lights in the parking lot. If I were coming here alone, I most likely would have just called it a $20 loss and went home."}
{"text":"I have ordered food 3 times so far for delivery; every time i order from here the food is amazing. I use the eat24 service so i don't have a customer service review but i will say the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery. Got the email confirmation. Almost a full hour later I get a call from grubhub saying my order was cancelled because the restaurant doesn't have a delivery driver. I am confused as to why no one told me sooner. I was sitting waiting for lunch for me & my 2 year old for almost an hour... only to find out it's not even coming or being made."}
{"text":"(Ordered for delivery through their own website)  All the recommendations for the crab puffs are absolutely correct, they are outstanding. The egg rolls were standard, not awesome not bad either. The sweet & sour sauce though... very, VERY good. They included extra large containers of it with the crab puffs and my sweet & sour chicken and I couldn't be happier with it. Delivery was prompt and ordering was pleasant and painless.  The prices are a teensy bit high but not terribly disparate with other chinese takeout places of the like, and if you use soy sauce, be warned that this place dispenses artificially flavored (as opposed to naturally brewed) soy sauce packets which, to me, are absolutely vile and ruin otherwise good food. Other than that, I recommend Tasty House highly and will order again."}
{"text":"Okay so reading the reviews I was a bit skeptic about ordering from here but I went for it either way. So far based on other people's experiences it seems like there have been ups and downs, but since I just started at this place so far all I've had is ups! Yes I only have tried their orange chicken, twice, but that alone was amazing, like someone said in their reviews, it isn't too much but it's not too little, it's a good amount. The food was fresh as can be, it was cooked well, and it was neatly garnished for a restaurant that I didn't expect to garnish their food. I recommend this place so far, my experience could change but no place is perfect. One screw up isn't going to ruin my whole experience, so if you're looking for local mom and pop shop kinda place, this is one of them."}
{"text":"Such a waste of money... Listen to the bad reviews. They were so mixed I wasn't sure what to do.. I made the wrong choice. I live two miles from this place and it took them an hour to get my food here then I got a lecture from the delivery driver how he had been calling me because he got lost and not once did he call. (Rude anyways, it's not my damn fault that you don't have gps). Besides that my egg drop soup is literally just eggs and broth.. No veggies or chicken in it like there normally is. Fried rice is dry and crunchy. Lo mein noodles dry. Shrimp and broccoli just doesn't taste right. Not to mention the $6 for each container of food is so so small. Should've just made the drive to abacus inn. Save your time and money and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Having experienced the no-so-cleanly interior of the restaurant, plus the less-than-stellar quality of the food, I fully expect to have food poising tomorrow morning.    The food is tasteless.  I spent a good 5 minutes trying to figure out what caused the dark brown / black spots on my General Tso's.  The chicken lo mein included some sort of wilt-y, leaf-y (not-so) green veggie.    This was... not good."}
{"text":"This was our second and probably last time ordering their food for delivery! We ordered the food off of Grub Hub at 4:22pm and it is now 6:23pm and still no food!!!  They said there kitchen is backed up. I don't care, get my family their food"}
{"text":"Would you like your chow mein to look nothing like chow mein? Would you like to have zero noodles in your chow mein but actually receive a small white bag of things that look similar to capt. crunch instead? Oh then this is place for you. If you'd like actual chow mein look elsewhere. This has been the weirdest customer service experience of my life. I called after I received my order, which was like..40 minutes later and I live right behind them...like seriously I can jump a wall, walk about 30 feet and there I am. Anyway, that wasn't a big deal I figured it would be that long. I call back after I opened this and saw what I had received. Also, ordered were spring rolls which were not crispy and oily enough where I needed to wash my hands after touching them. I told them this, and they told me that is how their chow mein is.....and I told them I was massively unsatisfied and I wanted a refund. They then told me to come down there and bring the food back. As pissed as I was, this was the last thing I was concerned about. I was then called back by one of the workers stating that they would not give me a refund because I should have known that they make Chow Mein without actual noodles referring to the menu which says \"crispy noodles\"....except there were no noodles....just a white bag of weird small pieces of something they are saying are noodles. I then get into a yelling match with them, let them know they will be taking it back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. I came in there, returned the food and they handed me my money back, I returned the tip for the delivery driver since its completely not his fault that they aren't actually service chow mein. One girl at the front told me \"I needed to calm down, and that if I have illness I should be in a hospital.\" after that I will never ever order from them again. The ordeal of this entire thing is enough to not only keep me from returning but I will tell everyone I know in this area about it. I would vote them a negative star if I could. The only small amount of customer service in the place is the owner who called me later on and apologized. Unfortunately there was a serious language barrier so I'm not sure he understood what had happened other than a customer was majorly pissed."}
{"text":"I used to eat here REGULARLY! I ordered the same items I always get (crispy beef, crispy chicken, and crab puffs). I received my order COLD the crab puffs, the sweet and sour sauce, and crispy beef and crispy chicken. My order total with tip came out to $60.00. When I opened the crispy chicken it wasn't very crispy or spicy as it used to be. The crispy beef which used to be my favorite had undissolved clusters of sugar and again was not spicy as it used to be YUCK!!!! The crab puffs were cold and unappetizing. I will NEVER eat here again. I will pay the extra trip charge to Flamingo Palace on 3rd Street and Bell. I am not chancing another experience at NOT SO Tasty House on 15th Ave and Bell."}
{"text":"This used to be our go- to Chinese restaurant for cheap NY style food. However, recently there have been changes in the quality of food. The pork wontons were soggy and the vegetable lo mein was mainly celery. Very disappointed with the decline in quality."}
{"text":"Veggie fried rice with no eggs, lots of yummy vegan options for us. They didn't have brown rice the night we ordered, but they called us before delivery to let us know. Food was fresh and delicious.  We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Just ordered from them and the lady told me 15 min for delivery. .......over an hour and a half later the guy showed up....after I cancelled my order with a bag of soggy.....cold food in his hands. ......when I called to cancel the order, the lady neither apologized....or tried to keep me as a customer. .....horrible service, horrible delivery  .......just horrible all around"}
{"text":"I went there a month ago and got the beef and broccoli, it tasted really good. I was happy to have found that place not far from home and with good prices. Went back there a week ago looking forward to try something else, I got the honey chicken. What a disappointment, some of the chicken was good but some bites tasted really weird, like if they mixed old and fresh chicken. I'm surprised I wasn't sick the next morning. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"I have a terrible feeling they've closed.  This is the best chinese food we've had in the 9 years we've lived here; they even have mei fun!   The phone just rings...we always get delivery-would love if someone knows if it's still open."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying this was some tasty food.  It was fresh, seasoned perfectly and well prepared.  The veggies were clean and crisp, the sauces did not seem as though they were dumped out of some open jars, and the flavors were bright.  (You cannot fake quality food)  We ordered the pot stickers, sesame chicken and egg foo young.  Delicious.    So why the 3 stars? The place was gross.  I mean REALLY gross.  I actually wanted to hose down the booth before we sat down.  The table was sticky, there was day-old food on the floor, the overhead lights were burned out and there was crap falling off the ceiling.  You could tell this used to be a smoking establishment because nicotine was seeping out from under the paint.  There was a ladder laying against the booths on the other side of the room that blocked anyone from sitting in that entire section.  (Good thing it was dead in there)   The only reason this place gets 3 stars is that the food was worth the chance of catching typhoid from eating in the dining room. Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Place is typical of what you will find for a mom and pop Chinese restaurant.  Went here for lunch and it's probably the cheapest lunch I've ever had at a little over $4 so a star for that.  The food came out piping hot and it was quite tasty so another 2 stars.  I felt the customer service was not all there.  The girl that helped me seemed bothered or annoyed by me.  Would I come back here?  Probably not.  As much as i loved how affordable lunch was,  you get what you paid for and you don't get a whole lot of food.  I liked this place better as its predecessor,  panda king."}
{"text":"The search to find a place that even compares to our favorite, Grand Dragon, continues. Tasty house just doesn't measure up, the Kung pao is flavorless, the egg rolls are just blah and the dumplings greasy. Another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"at a coworkers recommendation, stopped in for lunch an will say not the worst, but was clean, very empty, no other customers.  will not return"}
{"text":"OMG!  I am so disappointed!  The grand-kids and my family are gone for the weekend and I could order from anywhere I wanted - after settling on Tasty House because of their  Chef's Special of Crispy Pan Fried Noodle with shrimp, chicken, and beef, I sat down to eat and noticed the \"crispy pan fried noodles\" were a soggy rendition of lo-mein and called Tasty House back only to be yelled at by the manager when I nicely questioned the soggy noodles and he kept yelling \"that's how we do it\"over and over.  I drained about a half cup of liquid out of them and tried to mix it with my fried rice but there are too many weird/unpleasant tastes.  Worried I might get sick so threw $30 worth of food in the garbage and will drive to east Phoenix to the Desert Jade - now that's how you make pan-fried crispy noodles with huge shrimp, and fantastic food!!  I am $30 lighter but also smarter!!  There is no way this place ever received 5 stars unless they wrote the reviews!!  Oh yea, the crab puffs were made with a crab flavoring, not with crab - they had a really gross super sweet flavor and I could not finish even one  of them!  I could keep going, but I'm sure you get my drift!"}
{"text":"Total crap. How insulting to have to pay for fortune cookies and then they tasted like they were 10 yrs old. Everything was awful. Save your money"}
{"text":"I wish I could say that Tasty House was both tasty and delicious but sadly, I didn't even get to eat my meal.  We place a delivery order via phone at 6:30 and they told us 40-50 mins....no big deal.   At 7:30, the driver called because he was lost.  I gave him the gate code and he said he was okay.  Fast forward a bit, after over 15 phone calls between me, the driver and the restaurant, it is now 8pm and we still don't have our food.  The driver is clearly lost, I have no idea where he is and since he doesn't speak very good English, he has no way to tell me where he is.    I called the restaurant to let them know that he's very lost and at this point we just want to cancel our order, get a refund and go somewhere else.  The man on the phone kept telling me to \"hold on\" so he could contact the driver and kept insisting he was \"5 mins\" away.  At this point, our food would have been so cold it wouldn't have mattered.  After I finally told him I didn't want to wait anymore and just wanted a refund, he told me I would have to wait for a delivery drive to bring me cash back...apparently he didn't know how to configure a refund.  We ended up driving out of our way to go and get the cash back because we didn't want to deal with the charge back.  Turns out they had entered my address incorrectly into their system which is why the driver was completely lost...although I had repeated my address several times and never heard them admit an error.  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and I have never had such a poor experience as I have had tonight."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. The one star would be for friendly telephone service when I called to try them out for delivery! And they found my place even though it can be a little confusing to find.   Other than that - with regards to food (what really matters) it is pretty bad. I ordered the pork filled fried wontons, the chicken chow mein and the mongollian beef.   The wontons were super greasy. The chow mein was a big soggy bland pile of mostly cabbage and chicken. The \"noodles\" were fried won-ton like - not like standard chow mein noodles. When I ordered the guy said that's how it was but I guess I didn't really think about it and thought I'd give it a try.  The mongollian beef was a disaster too - mostly bamboo (I think) and you had to really dig to find the beef. And then, the beef was bland without the rich flavorful sauce that is typical.   It was all severely disappointing - even the  fortune cookie tasted like plastic/chemicals. The only thing I ate was the white rice and a few wontons (cause I was really hungry).   The rest pretty much went in the garbage disposal!!! What a waste of $24!!!!!  Do not give this place a try!!!!"}
{"text":"What is this hole in the wall place?? I wasn't sure if we were supposed to talk to the back of this lady's head or what. Only one other table with people eating and they sat us next to them. So when they brought out our chef boyarde we ate a few bites and I vomited a little bit in my underwear. Got it to go. We \"accidentaly\" left it on the table. I don't want bed bugs.."}
{"text":"Tasty House has 4 reviews -- two of which have been chosen as ROTD on separate occasions.  They may have gotten lucky with the infamous yelp algorithm, but they really do deserve it.  4.5 stars   ( even for a Hole-In-The-Strip-Mall )  The quality, portion, and price all combine together in a trifecta of value.  They are really friendly, ingredients are always fresh, and the food really is tasty!  Fried/Steamed dumplings is a new favorite.  They are thicker and more doughy, like dim sum -- and delicious!"}
{"text":"I received fast service. and it was yummy I will be ordering a lot more here.."}
{"text":"this is absolutely the worst food in the entire fucking universe. not only did they burn everything, no sauces, no cookies. the food is so gross, my dog that eats it's own poop wouldn't even touch it. i tried. she literally ran outside. stay away from this place.    we ordered from grub hub, they called the restaurant to facilitate a refund. the restaurant absolutely refuses to refund my money. they are scam artists. they couldn't even get hired at walmart as a greeter.     i have never had such horrible food in my entire life. shut your doors, pack your bags and go live in the fucking caves of some unknown country!      AND NOW THEY WON'T EVEN ANSWER THEIR PHONES. 40 MINUTES BEFORE THEY CLOSE. WORTHLESS! COMPLETELY WORTHLESS WASTES OF HUMANKIND. I'M ASHAMED THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BREATHE THE SAME AIR AS MINE. THEY SHOULD EXIST ONLY ON DOG FARTS."}
