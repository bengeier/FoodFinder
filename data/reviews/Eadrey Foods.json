{"text":"Love their chicken curry rotti AND EVEN their veggie curry rotti! Soo AMAZING!!! Not greasy at all, perfectly seasoned and has the moistest chicken.  

You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"I get the jerk chicken dinner almost once a week on my way home from work. So convenient and yummy. Sure beats cooking!"}
{"text":"Taking up the space that The Foodist Mart left behind is Eadrey Foods. On-offer are prepared foods to-go and some gift-basket goods - with a bit of Carribean flair. Samples are strewn about to entice you and the staff are eager to assist.

The cold-case is filled with a variety of salads - zucchini, greek, bean, and a very tasty sweet potato salad with a nice crunch from green onions. The small size was a decent amount for a light lunch. Sandwich staples like ham and swiss are also balanced out with more interesting ones like jerk chicken w/mango salsa.

The shelves are stocked with gourmet goods and house-made sauces. In particular, the hot sauces look intriguing. Also spied: Jerk rubs, peppercorn marinade, and apple ginger sauce, to name a few.

In addition, I had a strawberry lemonade that was refreshing, but a bit on the sweet side. Still, very good and I would consider getting it again.

Overall, a nice place for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: we are Eadrey's biggest fans. But know also that we've lived in the neighbourhood since the early 80s and I worked at both of the local elementary schools. As a result, we are able to compare and contrast Leslieville shops and services from a perspective that goes back a ways. Eadrey's Food is fantastic. Period. Both the mains and the desserts are consistently top-quality, with a creative flair plus regular surprises not found elsewhere. Service is consistently excellent and the price point is reasonable. I'm done. The end."}
{"text":"Veggie roti is amazing and enough for two people. Samosa are great. The chipotle chicken sandwich is yummy. Real chicken and very fresh"}
{"text":"I enjoy Eadrey Foods.
The Quinoa, Beet, and Sweet Potato Salads are my favourite.
The Jerk chicken, and Roti are also very tastey.

{"text":"Best roti in the neighbourhood!! Moist chicken in the curry and the veggie curry is also delicious. The hot sauce that Eadrey makes and sells is the real deal. If you're one who can take the spice, check it out! The baked goods are delicious as well. This is my go-to place for some yummy meals for my family."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy options and legit roti! The staff is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place, there's a variety of good eats, and it all looks great.  It's too much to choose from.  Homey and artisan all at the same time?  My tastebuds love you."}
{"text":"This place has such variety and you can't tell from the outside. I had the jerk chicken with rice and beans and it was tasty. The chicken was moist, cooked well with the sauce. Careful if you are asking for some chilli sauce, it taste fiery till it burns your tongue! So if you can't handle the spice, then dont even dare ask for it.
They also have other baked sweets such as apple strudel with salted caramel, biscotti, cookies and macaroons. 
Apart from such a mix, they also sell some artisan things such as jams, teas, marinades and hot sauces.
The beet and onion salad is my favourite along with the samosa. Things that I must come back to try it out includes rotis with curry chicken."}
{"text":"ive stopped in to Eadrey twice now, the service is really great, very nice staff and very helpful. They have good, clean and healthy staples from salads to a variety of proteins. From my initial visits there I think they could likely re-think how they price items to accommodate customers like myself ;) like 2 salads + protein for XX dollars, as well as staying open later (dinner does happen after 7pm) but never the less i would highly reccomend it if you're looking for a tasty and healthy take-out option for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here to pick up the hot sauce that they sale. for a Toronto based company to do a hot sauce is good, but to do a hot sauce that is powerful and very hot is amazing. I'm not in the area enough, but when I am I make sure to come to this area and pick up a bottle or two. this store is small but also has other things available to eat on the fly or take home. this location has street parking and is serviced by the 501 queen, 502 and 503. the staff here are great and the service is amazing."}
