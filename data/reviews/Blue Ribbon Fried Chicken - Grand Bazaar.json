{"text":"I was surprised. I had chichen tenders. Chicken was excellent quality no fillers. Cooked to perfection.  I'd say better than Chick-fil-A. Plenty of fries.  Skimpy on side of slaw."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life (well....since my plane landed in Las Vegas)?  The bad news is I found out this gem my last day in Vegas.  I devoured my Drum Line and the hubby killed his chicken tenders.  Drinks are on point!"}
{"text":"I regret we ordered chicken here today.. We had enough of buffet the last couple of days.. and since today is our last day in Vegas we just wanted a quick bite for lunch before heading to the airport.. The price is too expensive 6pcs chicken is 22bucks.. for me thats ok it must be good for the price.. We order to go coz our plan is to go at Bally's food court where we can grab rice .. good thing We did! why? the chicken is TOO SALTY!!! salty on its breading but when you eat the inside part of it? Its TASTELESS!!! OMG.. You cannot even compare the price and Taste of POPOYES Chicken or even KFC.. Totally Ripoff"}
{"text":"Totally overrated! The loaded fries are really good but that chicken sandwich lacks seasoning. I asked for bacon on my sandwich and they gave me bacon bits SMH. Terrible. Never going back."}
{"text":"Perfect fried chicken!!!  If you are craving for some fried chicken and are bored of all those expensive restaurants in Vegas casinos, this is definitely a place to check out.  Their chicken is perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside while juicy on the inside.  A lot of place have fried chicken that tends to be dry from over cooking, this is not that.  You can also try it with different types of sauces, but I preferred it just like that.  The sides are ok.  Beware the place is generally crowded and you might have to sit outside."}
{"text":"This ain't your Rosco's Chicken and Waffles.  Let's be real about fried chicken in any area dominated by tourists and shoppers- you're probably over paying for not-so-southern style fried chicken.  While Church's (aka Texas Chicken depending where you live) and Jollibee hold my top spots for taste and value, this place surpassed my expectations being smack in the middle of the LV strip.  For about $30, my girlfriend and i had a relatively generous dinner for what LV restaurants would offer at this price-point (3 thighs, a fried chicken sandwich, and sides).  There was no wait to order and plenty of seating, which was nice considering we went on a Saturday night.  Their sauce selection at the tables was nice- honey, some special sauce, a combo of hot sauce and honey, and a siriacha-like sauce.  And of course ketchup for non hipsters"}
{"text":"I heard good things about Blue Ribbon so I went to give it a try. The staff was chewing gum while taking my order and I've noticed all the staffs here don't smile. Anyways, I ordered the Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich togo and the first couple bites was really good. Until I saw a piece of hair sticking out from the sandwich!!! I was hoping it was just a piece of string from the chicken but no... It was HAIR!! It was a long brown hair! I stopped eating it and took couple pictures of it. I don't know if I want to go back here. I was so happy they opened up on the strip :("}
{"text":"I actually went back to Vegas within 2 weeks of my initial review for a conference and stopped by this chicken place again. I think they read my review because they fixed the issues I had. The service was so much better. They got rid of some of the beers and added new ones. The chicken, fries and cole slaw were just as tasty. In fact the cole slaw was so good that I ordered another side of it.  I love this chicken place. I wish they had it in LA. I'm definitely going back when I go to Vegas. The prices are a bit steep but I guess it reflects the market price of the location."}
{"text":"Good chicken sandwich. Like everything in Vegas, it is expensive. One order of fries is enough for multiple people."}
{"text":"Good food but customer service is horrendous. The whole staff gave the vibe that nobody wants to be there."}
{"text":"As I cherish the times I've had in sin City, the aromatic fragrance of sweet, deep fried chicken fills my lungs. Many who wander claim to not be lost, in my travels I stand tall and admit, I have been and will be lost throughout my adventures. Arriving at this chicken joint I'm greeted with humble and inviting personalities from all across the world... The Vegas world. I decided to scarf down a royal wing food entree which consisted of 6 individually picked wings. Succulent pieces of prime poultry. I drizzled every sauce I could get my paws on, and boy.. what a great decision I have made. One of the few good choices I've made in my life. I'm glad to say choosing blue ribbon fried chicken has made my life a little more tolerable. I take my wig off for this place and will return to feast another time. 5/5 will try again."}
{"text":"The reviews way overhype this place. I ordered a two wing basket, added a small Mac and cheese and a medium drink for a tab of over $16. I'd say it was ok, but there must be better choices close by.  The chicken was tender and moist, but not freshly cooked or hit. Really barely warm. Whatever seasoning the sprinkle on it after it is cooked doesn't really help with the flavor. I ate the first wing plain. The second I used a couple of the sauces. I'd say these are mandatory because they add a lot. The honey chipotle was good.  I got lucky with the fries and caught a fresh batch. I noticed the cook just dumped the fresh over a large quantity that were already in the pan so in a few orders the people wouldn't be as lucky as I. The mac in the mac and cheese was perfectly cooked but I didn't care for the cheese at all and didn't eat much if it.  Decor is ok. Staff is listless and not too helpful. The people filling orders seemed clueless, I guess just bored."}
{"text":"Just okay for me. Does not pack a good crispy crunch, but has good seasoning. Popeyes chicken is 100x better."}
{"text":"We have been here 2 days in a row! The chicken sandwiches are amazing, especially the one with pineapple! Fries are perfect and don't miss the honey chipotle sauce!!! Great addition to the Grand Bazaar shopping area."}
{"text":"Blue Ribbon is located in the Grand Bazaar just steps outside of Bally's.  First off, they are open until 2am for the late night eats.  I went at a more respectable time of 2pm I think... you know, you lose track of time in Vegas!  Anyways, casual eatery for all things chicken.  I was surprised to learn that the chicken is not coated in thick breading/batter.  If you want that, then you will be disappointed.  It is covered in a very thin coating of spices, yet the chicken tenders remained juicy and flavorful.  The fries with seasoning were awesome.  Coleslaw was aight... nothing too special about it.  I sat next to one of the sauce caddies, so I was able to taste test with all the sauces.  I didn't have a stand out favorite sauce, but it was fun to try."}
{"text":"Spent a lot of money on a lot of shitty \"nice restaurants\" this weekend. In the end, Blue Ribbon was my favorite place to eat.   Try the Firebird!"}
{"text":"I have not been back to Las Vegas since 2013 and a lot has changed since then!  My friend told me about this chicken place, so I had to try it.  Their chicken was very meaty, crispy, and tasteful.  The seasoning they have on the chicken taste great and you didn't have to dip the chicken in any sauce.  On the tables, they have a variety of different sauces.  I really like the Honey Wasabi it's more sweet than spicy and I don't even like wasabi.    Inside is small seating area but there are tables outside to enjoy people watching.  The staff is friendly and they clean the tables after each person finishes."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken, well prepared.  Crispy burgers not too crispy.  Juicy and with flavorful.  Their honey based sauces were great, my favorite was their honey chipotle.  They also had cane cola."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! Definitely a go to for options on the strip that are reasonably price and delicious. Well worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb !! Stayed in Vegas and hit the spot up twice before i left had to come back for more . Everything is made fresh and the employees there are extra nice ! Loved the chicken , although i would pass on the wings next time they are small lol the 2 piece leg combo is where it's at and it's worth it !"}
{"text":"Wow. I was shocked!  I don't usually eat fried ANYTHING but I took a chance and had the chicken sandwich with caramelized pineapple and HOLY CRAP IT WAS YUMMY!!!!  The staff was nice and the bartender fun. What the place lacks in atmosphere, it feels a bit like a fast food joint in more than makes up for with the food and people."}
{"text":"Had very high expectations for this place. My friend and I got hungry at 12:00am after walking along the strip and decided what's better than some fried chicken! Well, let me tell you... The chicken is very bland, yes it was crispy but no flavor whatsoever. I got the Firebird sandwich and it was terrible. The chicken breast was very dry, not spicy at all. The bread was cold, the fries had probably been sitting there for a while since they weren't crispy at all. Just the overall service we received was poorly executed. Trust me when I say that the McDonalds spicy chicken sandwich tastes 10X better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   Had two fresh fried chicken breast and the cane Diet Coke.  Sat at the counter and was made to feel right at home.  Gonna break one of the Vegas Karma Rules and eat at the same place twice.   Maybe even tonight since they are open until 2 am.  Side note nothing to do with food.  The staff is just good people.  The manager shared stories about her husband's passion for fried chicken that rivals my own.  Team banter was positive.  Observed another manager patiently helping a team member with payroll paperwork."}
{"text":"We wanted fried chicken while we were on our anniversary trip and this place didn't disappoint. The drinks are great! The fries are great and the chicken was great although a bit too salty. I'm thinking maybe that was because we had wings and not larger pieces. Needless to say, the food tasted great and the service was great. We ordered the smoked macaroni and it was ok. It looked and tasted a little low quality so we would never get that again. But overall it was good. The food came out very quick too."}
{"text":"Okay let's begin by walking in your hit with a smell of grease. Okay what to be expected your in a fried chicken place. Look over the menu decided what we wanted. Came to the counter to order I ask the young lady can I sub the sides with a side salad I get I short no. Okay how about mac and cheese. I get a No! All you can get is more fries! Well okay then I'll get more fries. My boyfriend ask about what types of cheese they have. She gives him the well what sandwich. He tells her the blue ribbon. She says it doesn't come with cheese. Okay so we can't pay to have cheese added.?. We ordered waited about 8 min for already cooked sitting under a heat lamp food. And his sandwich was made wrong. He returned it about 5 min in he got up to ask about it and they forgot. For this service and quality of food you will probably get a nicer  server and fresh food at a popeyes."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is good. The people who are working here have a positive attitude and they are nice when they take your order and serve your food. I recommend this place for anyone who is in the area. Try it out."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken... It's hard to mess up and a cheaper option then what is in the casinos.  Blue ribbon sandwich, yum!"}
{"text":"Extremely good and great selection. The crisp to the chicken and seasoning is really good. Open late on weekday which is another added bonus. Restaurant was kept clean"}
{"text":"5 stars for Service. 4 stars for the food! Saw this place on Instagram and had to have it. First off Instagram is all show some of the stuff that I saw they didn't have as people make their own or it was a monthly special.    Ordered a kids meal it comes with 1 chicken strip and I added one more. It was $3.25 for an additional strip I shouldn't haven't ordered another one because the portion is hugeee!  My kid couldn't even eat 1. :( We also ordered the family meal and 2 of their chicken sandwiches. Everyone seemed to enjoy the chicken. I ended up eating the chicken sandwich we ordered the blue ribbon original and the Firebird.  The original one was okay! I liked the Firebird better it was super spicy though but it was a good kick.  I wasn't too crazy for the pickled cucumbers. I love pickles but cucumbers on a chicken sandwich odd combo to me but some people love it. The fries were really good as well as the shakes.   Elvia the girl at the front as well as the others working there were amazing. But Elvia was a total sweetheart, patient and helped me on what to order. They have some good service here.  All in all it was good and glad I can cross this off my list of places to try.  Prices are a little high but overall a good spot to try.  They are very clean and constantly coming around wiping the tables and cleaning up."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. It's not the best fried chicken sandwich I had but I like the variation for it. The chili one that I had was actually pretty damn spicy so it kinda gives a twist to your regular fried chicken sandwich. The other reasons why I like it though is that they have a good variety of sauces(honey, chipotle honey, wasabi honey and so on). I also really love the fries. These kind of fries are my absolute favorite. The thinner the fries, the more I like it. I had a bite of the fried chicken itself because my friend ordered it and that was the most surprise of all because the chicken itself was actually very good. However, I'm still unsure if I'll get the chicken itself over the sandwich just because I feel it's more worth it for the sandwich in terms of being full and a good portion vs the chicken itself.  I personally liked Blue Ribbon...It isn't Howling Rays but I would definitely come back AND it's probably one of the cheaper meals you can get in vegas."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and this place definitely hit the spot. Even in 107* Vegas heat. This place is on the Strip so prices are definitely high, but the pieces were perfectly crispy, crunchy and just a hint of spice. We actually went twice on the trip. Once at 1:30AM for a late snack.  Lots of great sauces to choose from too so you can change up each bite. Definitely worth a shot if you're just on the corner of Flamingo and LVB and standing in front of Ballys."}
{"text":"I was walking around when I smelled something awesome. I looked to my left and saw this fried chicken joint. Couldn't help my self and try it out. All I have to say is the fridge chicken was straight fire!! Most def coming back here when Im in Vegas again."}
{"text":"had this bookmarked for my next vegas trip and well it did not disappoint! super crispy and juicy!!!  the workers were nice but the food took way too long. few customers but not super busy (1:15 am). the sodas taste weird here too lol.   ill come back."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had!!!  A fried chicken sandwich is my #1 choice at a restaurant. That being said, I read others reviews on here and knew I had to try.  I ordered \"The Rancher\" ($9) with a side of sweet potato fries. Comes with bacon and cheese which is wonderful. The sweet potato fries were delicious. They have lots of sauces, my favorite was their ranch dressing.  Overall very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. 10/10 will return before my trip ends!!"}
{"text":"Winner-Winner Chicken Dinner (actually it was lunch) but never the less, this may have been the best fried chicken I've eaten and that includes my wife's which is excellent.  Of course I found this place \"Yelping\" and it lived up to the reviews.  Small eat in take out fast food type place but that's where the comparison stop. Friendly hello upon opening the door and the aroma of fried urns, spices and chicken tips the scales.  Several options of He icee of chicken you desire and nice sides to accompany them I went with a breast and two wings that came along with shoestring fries that were plentiful and a side of coleslaw that was delicious. Chicken was juicy inside and super crispy and  super favorable on the outside. If you are in the area this is a must try. Just good fried chicken."}
{"text":"This was one of the best hangover/hair-of-the-dog meals I had this round in Vegas. I mean, it's greasy delicious fried chicken for God's sake! The sauces, chicken, fries, and side are all awesome. Plus you can get some beers to wash everything down. This was a fun/satisfying place to start the day after an intense night. Good people watching."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Was expecting much more. Nothing about this place stood out to me. The works fries were way tooo salty and I felt like the wings had too much coating/batter or whatever they put on it. They have a nice variety of sauces but nothing that tickled my tastebuds.   My boyfriend got the blue ribbon sandwich and he said the seasoning was too over powering. However, he said the chicken was nice and thick. It has your typical veggies and the bread was fluffy and sort of sweet.   Their habanero sauce was the best one out of the 5 or 6 that they have. They also have milkshakes that I wanted to try along with the alcoholic ones! This joint also closes at 2am on some days which might be good for those late night munchies."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I have ever had.  i just love the crispy fried skin.  Nothing like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"On a hot October afternoon, I was wandering the strip for some lunch and came across Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken near Bally's hotel. I ordered the Blue Ribbon Chicken Sandwich and it was so goood. The chicken was both crunchy AND tender (after trying so many fried chicken places, I realized how hard it is to make fried chicken that is both juicy and crunchy) and it went perfectly with the tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. There's also a variety of original sauces and honeys that paired with the chicken very well like the chipotle honey, wasabi honey, wildflower honey, and blue ribbon bbq sauce. If I am ever craving a chicken sandwich on the strip, this is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"Chicken is ok.. I got the 4 pcs mix, combo seems to include fries and coleslaw.  The coleslaw is the same itty bitty size as the container I asked for to get some ketchup to go.  Food seems overpriced and it took a minute to wait for.    I would go back if someone was treating.  I ordered a side of Mac n cheese this is ok value is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab a quick late night snackie. The fried chicken was crispy, juicy, and tender. I liked how there was a variety of sauces to choose from for dipping the chicken in. My favorite sauces were the honey-based ones, especially the wasabi honey and the chipotle honey. The sweetness provided a nice contrast to the savory flavor of the chicken.  The fries were also a nice surprise I was not expecting. They were cut thinly and tasted super crunchy. Blue Ribbon probably ranks as one of my top spots for fries!"}
{"text":"Yummy fries and sandwiches! Wish we ordered more when we were in Vegas! Definitely coming back to this place when we visit again."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and FRIES were good. As other reviews pointed out it took very long time (30 minutes) to get my order when there were only few people ahead of me and chicken was premade. The counter person was very unprofessional and service is disappointing at best."}
{"text":"The fire bird chicken sandwich was awesome.  We also had sweet potato fries and coleslaw very good!  The staff was very friendly and the bar tender was so much fun!  She was awesome with her megaphone!"}
{"text":"This place was hard to find at first. I live in the nearby Las Vegas area and didn't know where to park as well. This restaurant is located in front of the Bally's hotel in an area called the grand bazaar. If you park in Bally's parking lot and you are a resident here, you can park for free for up to 24 hours using your valid Nevada state ID.  Now, about the food here. I would have to say that the chicken is very tasty and tender. There's not so much batter taking over the chicken experience. They seem to use homemade pickles in their sandwiches. I would recommend this place as I enjoyed the food tremendously. However, I would not recommend the lemonade or the shakes. The price of their shakes is $5.95 which to me is ridiculous. You could go somewhere else afterwards and get better dessert for a lot less. The lemonade tastes like the powder mix not like real lemonade. I was very disappointed with it. Also, when I was trying to locate this restaurant, I tried calling but no one answered, another negative to this place. But overall I would give this place four stars for the flavor and tenderness of their chicken. Check them out and let us know what you think!  Update, I am now a vegan and came here with my family for lunch. I had the kale salad and sweet potato fries. They were pretty good in spite that they're known for their chicken. I was hopeful that I could at least have those two things. I would probably have the salad again, it was tasty after all."}
{"text":"Located in the rear of the Grand Bazaar outdoor shopping area on the Strip outside of Bally's.  Order at the counter.  We got the dark meat pieces with fries and slaw.  It was very good.  Service was fine, but no refills on soda.  I tried all of the sauces on the counter on my fried chicken.  Honey and fried chicken is a good combo."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich here. I enjoyed every bite. I was sick that day and couldn't taste anything. But I was able to taste the this chicken. The only thing I am not crazy about is their seating. It's kinda difficult to find comfortable seating here."}
{"text":"What an amazing chicken sandwich but I think it's pretty pricey.  I'm the biggest fan of fried chicken and this place was definitely on par. I came here on a Vegas trip and I definitely do not regret it. I highly recommend this place.   we all know chick fila is pretty bomb but imagine that x10!!! it's that good!"}
{"text":"I remember the good old days when LA eatery, Golden Bird, was the best chicken ever.  Well there's a new chick in town, and Blue Ribbon Chicken is it.  Haven't had this good of a time getting my yardbird on in ....never.  Wow!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Probably the best fried chicken in the city! Staff is friendly and the location is clean! Very family friendly and the restraint is casual. Employees are helpful and all of there food is quality."}
{"text":"The chicken wings were extremely small for the prices with no flavor or seasoning. The cole slaw was small but again no seasoning. The Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy but again no flavor. Overall, the menu is lacking flavor and seasoning!"}
{"text":"Everything they make is so tasty! Large portions of fries come with all combos. The soda is great but there is also free water available. The sauces are all great! I really thought I'd only like 1 or 2 but I loved them all. I'm definitely planning my next trip."}
{"text":"Yummers! Got the royal wing, blue ribbon sandwich and pulled chicken sandwich. With some sides: cucumber & coleslaw. Food great! Homegirl ringing me up was on the ghetto side no customer service whatsoever! The guys working were on point even helped with bringing our drinks to our table outside."}
{"text":"You can't visit Las Vegas without getting some Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken!!!! It's so golden brown and seasoned by the gods!!!! I am definitely coming back here. It's not a big place and it's really busy but it's worth it."}
{"text":"A \"light\" fried chicken sandwich with all the essentials. Shredded lettuce, tomatoes and my favorite condiment, pickled cucumbers top this sandwich. It's much more like fast food and I'd compare it more to a brand like Chik Fil A. Located in the Bazaar Shop \"alley\" across Bellagio, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken is just one of many affordable eateries on the strip."}
{"text":"No doubt good fried chicken. Mac and Cheese was tasty. Would like to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I have to start this review by saying that I didn't eat at Blue Ribbon. We only stopped by to get my husband a Bloody Mary. But what a drink that was! A sip of it was enough for me to give them 4 stars.  Why? Because there's a chicken wing in the drink! That's something I'd never seen before. And, on top of that, the drink tasted delicious!   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely stop by for a drink and some food, too. In fact, I'm very much looking forward to that!!!"}
{"text":"Been wanted to try this spot.. Now that I have..basic fried chicken that's been over hyped."}
{"text":"Service was good. The chicken was moist, but didn't care too much for the flavor. Tasted only cayenne pepper. I ordered the royal wing which was 6 full wings and fries with cole slaw. I added an a breast as well. The breast was super moist. I may need to try the chicken sandwich next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place for fried chicken. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I devoured my thigh/leg combo along with my kids leftover crispy wings."}
{"text":"The chicken is good, well seasoned and very flavorful and crispy skin. Do not like the fries (too skinny for me, you have to pick up and eat a handful to taste them). The cole slaw was not very good at all.   This particular location is located in an absolutely horrible location. The seating inside this place is a 1. Terrible, terrible seating plan (literally no tables) just bar type seating.  Not comfortable at all. We will not return to this location. We would not recommend this location to anyone nor will be take any friends or family there."}
{"text":"Between a 3 and a 4 but service was good so I'll give it a 4.  I would recommend the chicken wings. The \"fries all the way\" were a bit too much for me. They also sell alcohol. I got a small can of sangria and it was a bit pricey ($10). You might as well go to CVS right next door!  If you want greasy food, definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"Came here twice over the weekend because this chicken is pretty bomb. Plus there are different sauces you can add to give it more flavor etc. Half of the sauces are some sort of honey and there are n two hot sauces which aren't really hot. A line forms at night time, but in the day time the service is fairly fast."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken. Super amazing seasoning! Fries are tasty too. Also liked the cream flavored soda."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! Amazing shoe string fries! Everything was so flavorful. The line moved quickly. There are lots of sauces and honey to put on your chicken. There are options of sandwiches and various pieces of chicken to choose from. Sides, milkshakes (alcoholic and non). Great customer service. Overall had a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Good Hot Bloody Mary! It has Hanson's Organic Habenero Vodka! It $12.00 but it is huge and spicy! And strong of course, you get your money worth! The service was nice!  I surly will be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings were good but may friend has the tenders and she said they were excellent. They come with some type of seasoning which is very tasty. And there are multiple sauces you can choose from as dips  one down side is you can only get regular fries with your order unless you upgrade for an additional price and the prices are already quite high for my taste, but hey it's Las Vegas so I guess it's to be expected!!  What I enjoyed the most was the Last Vegas Lemonade. This drink is a must!!  I believe it's made with lemonade and Kentucky Burbon.  Again, if you are a drinker this is definitely the drink for you."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple times and always sit outside at the little bar, Tiffany the bartender is so much fun to talk with, her service is excellent and such a pretty girl, they have lots of yummy alcohol beverages at the window(Milkshakes!!) I will be going back, can't wait till the weather is nicer, at night this is a cool place to sit and have a snack and a alcoholic beverage!"}
{"text":"The chicken was very good it was my first time having it was so good came back the next day next time I come to Vegas I will definitely be here again I recommend this place to anyone that loves chicken"}
{"text":"The chicken here is gross soggy yet still over breaded.I don't get the high rating!? Chick fil a and canes are much better for half the price.i won't be back. Over priced ."}
{"text":"Great fast option on the strip. Chicken sandwich was amazing. Small fry can easily be shared with another person (or two). Employees were extremely friendly. Would definitely come back again for another visit."}
{"text":"It's on the strip but not, at the same time. Me and a few friends were looking for something new to eat after a long night and we came across the hidden gem. The menu is simple but that's what you need at a place like Vegas because you can easily get caught up with the glitz and glamour of Vegas lights and spend a paycheck on one meal.   I recommend this place to anyone wanted to get away from all the casino noise and cigarette smoke. Oh, the fried chicken is bomb! :-)"}
{"text":"Looooooved this place the tenders are awesome and they have like 10 diff types of honey to drizzle over them (wasabi, chipotle, etc). The chicken livers and onions were also really good for those that like them."}
{"text":"I just won $400 at the casino and i feel like i still lost after eating this half ass chicken. Wtf have you people been eating? I got a basic ass chicken sandwich with a half fresh roll and basic chicken patty. I got the Firebird sandwich. On a bed of lettuce, might as well call it the firebird salad. The chicken is not crispy at all and has no flavor. The chipotle mayo is good but anyone that messes up chipotle mayo should not be in the food business. I bet you can walk next door to wahlburgers and get a better sandwich. Or get pizza at the giordano place next door. This is awful. And their service is nothing special. Forgot my beer and i had to ask her for it and then she started checking past receipts like i was lying. Foh. You guys can enjoy the product of good marketing while i go eat good food."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Let me start with the overall taste of the fried chicken since that's what's obviously drawing people to this place. It was good but not as mind blowing as the experience of getting it turned out to be. We got there around 11 pm on a Sunday. There were about 6 people ahead of us in line. The line took about 30 minutes to get to us. We're immediately told by the girl taking orders that all they have is chicken and we can only order chicken. Mind you a fresh tray of fries just came out. I ask if we can order fried chicken livers and she said no. Only fried chicken! In any case, we end up ordering 2 chicken strips at $3.50 each and a breast at $5.50 along with a chicken sandwich. The total comes to around $25! It now takes another 20 minutes for us to get our food. Mind you, the chickens already all premade and sitting right behind the counter ready to throw into a bag right next to a huge tray of now cold fries that we weren't allowed to order while they were still hot! The cashier continues telling people all they can order is chicken.  My number is called and I go to get my food. It's not to go and I tell the guy it's supposed to be, to which he responds, \"that's not what the ticket says\"! Anyways... We begin walking down the strip and I pull out the strips to munch on while walking back to our hotel and they are kid meal sized tiny! I feel like I've seen bigger strips when I've order nuggets from other places! Definitely not worth $3.50 each! They have a family meal which feeds 4 and comes with 12 strips! Truth be told, I could easily put away all 12 of those strips and last I checked I wasn't an entire family! The chicken sandwich wasnt great at all. You could tell that the chaos happening inside the restaurant greatly affected how this sandwich was rushed to put together. It was soggy and lacked flavor. Long story short... The fried chicken was good but the experience makes me never want to go back especially considering the thousands of other restaurant options all around this one!"}
{"text":"This spot is located in that front-of-the-ballys shopping and eating area.  Went on a quieter Monday evening, and we still had a very fresh, fried, crispy, juicy, moist(yes,MOIST), and tasty signature sandwich. The bread was perfectly chewy and crispy at the same time, the chicken was accompanied by sassy pickles and some fresh cabbage(..?)  The meal isn't done there... The wholesome sandwich is accompanied by a slew of honey based sauces to go with my sandwich (or your other chicken based orders) Wasabi honey, Chipotle honey and brbbq sauce is just to name a few. ANYONE you know who likes chicken with honey or Tang or both. You need to come here!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they put a location on the strip! I had their other location bookmarked for a while and never had the chance to try it. This one is in the Grand Bazaar shops by Bally's casino. I stopped by 10 minutes before they closed and the employees were still very friendly even though they probably wanted to go home lol. I ordered The Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich and it comes with the special sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickled cucumbers. The wait wasn't long at all and I appreciated that they made the food fresh. There's also a variety of sauces at the condiment station... which is great if you're like me and like to dip each bite into something different.   There is seating inside and tables outside as well. The hours here are 11am-2am. The food was really good! Next time I come I'll wear sweatpants to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Good little chicken spot located in the Grand Bazaar in Vegas. The sandwiches are big and  the mac'n n cheese is tasty. Great if you need a quick bite and a beer as you can order both in the Bazaar."}
{"text":"I stayed at Ballys and the Grand Bazaar was right outside. I initially went for Wahlburgers but saw this place and definitely wanted to check it out. Which I did the following day for lunch. I got the drumstick and thigh meal and my wife got the chicken tenders meal. There was a lot of quantity on the food and the sauce options are intriguing (I like the wasabi honey) but truth be told, the chicken was amazing on its own. Succulent and juicy. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The inside is nice with a couple tvs and ample seating. There is a water dispenser and a fancy trash can. I nice place to just chill and eat if you are on the strip and don't want a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"After wanting to come I finally made it in today.  Let me start off by saying that the service was good. Employees were courteous and funny.  Now I'll start with the best part, the Nutella shake. It was soooooo good! Not overly nutella(Ey) it was just perfect.  We upgraded our order to a combo so it came with fries and a side of coleslaw. They were very generous with those and they were just okay.  When it came to the sandwich I give it a 3 out of 5 and here's why.  Their sauce is pretty delicious, the chicken was cooked perfectly BUT I feel like the pickled cucumbers overwhelm the taste of the sauce and the chicken. :( Overall it was good tho."}
{"text":"Blue Ribbon Fried chicken for the 1st time tonight after work at the Bazaar shops in front of Bally's. This is one monster frickin' chicken! So come with an appetite, delicious to boot. I had the Cheesy supreme with aged cheddar & American cheeses. Also big shout out to the sauce wheel at the table. With BBQ, hot sauce, wasabi honey, wildflower honey & Chipotle honey! I tried them all & they are all so creative and good as was the blue ribbon special sauce that come on the burger. You know I gotta have my special sauce!!! The staff was friendly & the wait was short for how packed it was."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh food. You must try the pickled peppers. The staff was very courteous. My husband and I decided to try this place based on the yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a really bomb fried chicken sandwich!  Service was quick and friendly.  We ended up sitting at the bar.  Great choice!  Tiffany, the bartender, was AMAZING!  Even though we didn't order a alcoholic drink, she was friendly and helpful!  She brought our food, gave us ranch, cleaned our table, and chatted us up.  How refreshing!  Thanks Tiffany for making our first stop in Vegas a great one!"}
{"text":"The chicken was hot a juicy but I think it needed more seasoning and not all that paprika they place on the tenders. If our are hungry this will hit the spot when you don't want to wait at Wahlburger next door."}
{"text":"Soooo good.  I ate here twice when I visited Vegas in November. The food is reasonably priced and the milk shake is to die for.  I had the fried chicken, fries, and slaw.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Had a burger with extra chicken and a single wing al carte.  The extra chicken on the sandwich is just another patty. Though it admittedly is quite a bit of food. Wouldn't really say the sandwich was so good that it was worth the 13-14 dollars.  I wasn't impressed by this small fried chicken chain despite being very hungry. The food was fine but nothing was particularly outstanding.   The breading they use is on the bready side and tastes like many other fast food chains. This is especially noticeable with the patty which isn't a piece of chicken breast but more processed like a culet, or again like something you'd get at a chain. The chicken wing I got was fine but it just wasn't high quality.  Was also turned off by the cashier who was rude. I normally don't write about service but this was pretty egregious especially given it was in Vegas.  You can add other sauces at the table though I did not since I wanted to try their food as is.   Personally I would skip the meal here at blue ribbon fried chicken given all the other amazing food choices here in Vegas. It definitely does not compare to great fried chicken places in LA like Howlin' Ray's or Dave's Hot Chicken."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken sandwiches hard to describe but delicious and messy! A very solid Mac&Cheese and the Spicy Slaw was just that. A very friendly staff the menu board is impossible to read so go for the paper menu. I would have missed the sides only looking up. Makes Chick-Fil-A look like White Castle"}
{"text":"I was walking the strips of Las Vegas, cold and despondent, the dinner my friend and I had just barely registering as actual food when lo and behold, we saw a sign for fried chicken near the LINQ, that boring spinning wheel thing that's supposed to be fun but is really, really boring and has terrible views. Anyways, back to the fried chicken. There was a sign for it, we were hungry, we walked in and BAM, this place kicks ass for fried chicken! You can get individual pieces...like leg, breast, whatever your thang is. Their coleslaw was perfectly slawed and crispy and the fried skin on the chicken...blows KFC out of the water. If you're craving late night fried chicken, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Had such high expectations for this place for some evening munchies but was disappointed with the food and the service.   First, the staff is sooooo unorganized.  Everybody's orders took forever when all of the chicken was already made and sitting behind the counters! When we got to the counter the seemingly new and clueless counter girl told us we can only order chicken (because they were out of everything) when a fresh pan of fries literally just came out of the fryer.   This place touts its 12 piece tenders meal as enough to feed a family of four. Thinking they were large my friend and I ordered 2 to find that they were TINY. We also ordered a fried breast piece and the Pit Burger. The tenders and the breast tasted pretty good and were fairly crunchy but by no means lived up to any hype. Especially the teeny portions of the tenders. The burger was not great either... it was kind of overstuffed and the flavors didn't really work. It was too wet overall.   Disappointing experience to say the least given the 35+ minute wait with only 6 ppl ahead of us in line and all the chicken was premade.."}
{"text":"Decent fried chicken for late night last minute. Got drumstick and thigh by itself. The chicken itself tasted good. But damn were they tiny. Average chicken place. Nothing special."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken sandwiches I've had!   It's tucked away behind a small plaza and there isn't any easy parking spots nearby, but it is definitely worth the walk. They have a bar window outside for easy access, but in terms of size for seating it is pretty small. There is seating outside however!  I ordered one of their signature burgers (sandwiches) The Blue Ribbon and their dirty fries.  The burger had delicious buns and the chicken was seasoned well and super crispy!  They also give you the choice of many sauces (about 6) which can suit your taste needs from spicy to sweet to savory. The dirty fries are a must try! Absolutely delicious! It includes bacon and Cajun seasoning. My girlfriend also ordered their cheesy supreme burger and really loved it.   Would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks back with my bro after a long night to meet up with some friends.  Location - Located in the shopping area in front of Ballys.  Venue  - Place is chill with a indoor dining area, little bar top area, and a outside walk up bar.   Food - Food was good and had good taste didn't get that wow I expected from the hype , but good stuff.   Service - Staff was friendly and did a job at getting  our order served after having to remind them about our drinks and getting some condiments.  Price - Regular going rate for food on the strip."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Our party ordered a few different things. We ordered our chicken in my 4 piece mix, the only thing that was fresh and hot was the breast. Everything else was soggy and barely warm. None of the employees seemed to be excited to be there except for the guy cleaning in the dining area. It took 20 minutes to get our food, but only about 5 minutes for the rest of our party that ordered separately after us. We watched a few people that ordered their food after us get it before us."}
{"text":"This by far the best fried Chicken on the strip. It has a light batter and the seasoning is something I've never tasted. This the first time in a long time I've had a great that wasn't dried out due to over frying. The fries were pretty good and the slaw could use a little more taste to it. It comes in a very small container and doesn't match the portions of the other items. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Nothing special I ordered the blue cheese chicken sandwich and fries which came to about 11or12 bucks and my wife had two chicken wings and fries for like 8 bucks personally I thought KFC or Popeyes had more flavor and seasoning in their chicken so  not sure what the hype is. I think it's a bit overpriced for the taste of the food. I saw that an 8pc with 2 sides was $40, like really? Service was slow but they were probably making the food by order"}
{"text":"Really, really good fried chicken. This place must stay packed as there was a steady stream of people in line during our ordering and eating. Missing out on a five star review because the pregnant cashier seemed to be in a daze and did forget one of the two drinks we ordered. Pregnant brain, maybe. I've been there.  At any rate, the chicken and fries were hot and REALLY good. I didn't care for the slaw, but everyone else seemed to. I'm a little picky about coleslaw, so I can't hold it against them."}
{"text":"So this place is on my route to work & I follow the las Vegas hashtag on Instagram & I always see how lovely & photogenic the chicken  sandwich looks......  The photos don't do it justiceeeeee. Chicken was plump & juicy white meat, flavors were there lettuce was crisp.... Just a well put together sandwich to say the least."}
{"text":"BEST DAMN CHICKEN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!    What else is there to say?  It was hot out the grease, fresh, and full of favor.. What I also liked was the different sauces that you dip you chicken in... I would of gave it 5stars but the fries where cold! Good but warm enough.  Service was AWESOME!! My mouth is watering just thinking about this chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken stop for fast delicious food on the strip. Bartender was really friendly and made us a bomb boozy milkshake!"}
{"text":"I did not care for the food. I know it is Vegas so it will be pricey but for the food we got I do not think it was worth it. I have had better chicken and the mac n cheese was not good at all."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. Hmm first I would say the food was okay. The chicken is expensive I warn you per piece. The wing is like 2$ per wing 0_0 that's alot of money. The fries loaded we're pretty good. I ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken was pretty flat and the price of the sandwich was almost 11 dollars. This place didn't wow me and would I eat here again probably not, but heyyyyy guys this is just advice do whatever you want to do lol. Later"}
{"text":"We walked in here totally randomly while touring the strip. I was slightly buzzed off frozen margaritas at the time. The counter girl was extremely sweet and helpful. When I looked around the place, I thought it looked cute, clean, modern, yet homey.  The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas. 5 bucks for a chicken breast and 10 bucks for a drumstick combo. The amount of fries we got with the combo was enough for two people as well.  But the chicken... oh lord the chicken..  Best fried chicken of my life. End of story.    I cannot wait to go back here and order the entire restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It may just seem like fried chicken but it was (kind of sadly) my favorite meal in Vegas. We ordered two chicken combos, which both came with fries and coleslaw and a blue ribbon chicken sandwich. The cashier was friendly and understanding of our indecisiveness as well as our little paying war (Asians always want to pay). But the fried chicken was perfect. Good amount of spice and juicy. I normally don't eat that much coleslaw but i ate almost half. And I couldn't stop eating the fries. The hot sauce available isn't that hot but that was a minor detail. And the staff brought us water without asking, even though it was self-serve. The only thing I didn't like was how loud the music was--we had to shout to hear ourselves."}
{"text":"This place knows how to cook their fried chicken! I ordered a kale salad with fried chicken and was really surprised on how the chicken was perfectly moist! It was not greasy, over cooked, or dry. I thought it was just my luck but I was wrong. I took a bite of the fried chicken burger and the meat was cooked to perfection! They have shoestring fries which were well seasoned and cooked the way it's supposed to be... not soggy and not overly fried. If I ever crave for some good fried chicken, I will definitely go back to this joint."}
{"text":"This chicken was the absolute BOMB. The staff Marcella and Dayshunae were the best. They made us feel at home and got us drunk. We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"If you love fried chicken like me, but don't want to pay the Vegas price, Blue Ribbon is the place for you. It's located in this outdoor food court on the corner of Flamingo Rd and Las Vegas Blvd. They have quite a few options with their pieces of fried chicken, their famous chicken burgers, salads, and other things you can get ala carte. It is not a bad price for Vegas, and the food is tasty. I got their Blue Ribbon Sandwich, which is their most popular/original sandwich. The chicken was seasoned very nicely. You can taste the different spices. It was moist and super crunchy. I added a drink and fries for $2 more. It was SO worth!   My friends got pieces of fried chicken. I tried a bit of their's, and the chicken was the bomb! I wish I was able to go back to that place during my trip, but we didn't get the chance. Next time!   The service there was also on point! They were really friendly and seemed to be enjoying their time serving customers. Unlike most places where you order at the counter and they seem so unenthusiastic. That was a nice change. I'd definitely will come back next time."}
{"text":"It's a lot healthier than the other chicken sandwich places but still tasted really good. They have a large selection of sauces. fries were good"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey for fried chicken but is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin is super crispy and the meat is not overly oily. The chicken wasn't too salty but the right amount of salty. The food was amazing and simple and I would eat this everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken sandwiches, juicy chicken, and loaded fries. Knocked one star for the flavorless cole slaw and shoestring fries but overall, good chicken."}
{"text":"They got our order wrong and the food wasn't soo great. But they did give me a side of fries for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is still talking about the fried chicken he had here. It's a small restaurant. The serve alcohol and mainly just fried chicken, Sandwiches, and some sides. I had the double cheese sandwich that was good but I have had better. My boyfriend had the sandwich with the pineapple on it and he said it was very good but would of got more of the fried chicken instead. We definitely would go back and just order the fried chicken. It was the best. So delicious and the flavor was amazing. It also just fell off the bone it was cooked so good."}
{"text":"I've read many good reviews and I had to try it.  I enjoy good fried chicken and this was good.  I noticed that they added extra dry spicies after they fried the chicken which I found interesting.  Clearly, it gave the chicken more flavor.  The real trick was the sauces.  The mix of sauces and the added spicies made the difference.  It was pricey but this is Vegas. The staff was helpful. I have no complaint.  It is worth a try if you enjoy fried chicken."}
{"text":"I get the rancher because of my love for Ranch. The small fries is more than enough for me to share with the hubby.  What made my experience was the incredible service we got outside. Corey was so attentive but not a bother. He made sure to check in here and there. I see you Corey and your hard work. I just hope your boss sees this too! You are a rare sight to see in the customer service world. Thank you so much for taking such good care of us!"}
{"text":"Hidden just below Bally's so could be hard to find. Good food and decent prices for sandwiches, fried chicken, and tenders. Also alcoholic shakes if you desire. Buffalo sauce would be the only thing I might add to the tables or as an option on a sandwich. We ate outdoors on the patio because the space inside is quite small."}
{"text":"Seriously the best chicken sandwich ever. How can something so simple be so good?  The seasoned breading is so good and of a great consistency. I prefer my chicken sandwiches to be of a thinner cut with lots of crispy breading and this completely fit the bill.  The shoestring fries are fantastic. I'm not big on fries and I don't usually order them but I ended up eating half of my husband's  (whoopsie). They have Boylan soda which is ok, but I'm a Coke girl. I loved this place so much I had it 2 of my 4 nights in Vegas. We had a nice dinner at Buddy V's one night, but to be honest I was just as happy with this chicken sandwich :) They also had a container for serve yourself complimentary water, which seems to be a rarity in Vegas. Great food, great service, reasonable prices. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially the sandwiches, but good lord it takes forever to get your food here"}
{"text":"Pretty standard fried chicken place. It's a small shop located at the bazaar outside of Bally's. Prices were really reasonable considering the location. A sandwich will run you about $9 (no sides included). I ordered the blue cheese bacon and red onion chicken sandwich. I enjoyed it. The orange habanero sauce on the table was good, I dipped everything in it. I also got the livers and onions. Nothing was too greasy or overly fried.  I recommend it if you like fried chicken."}
{"text":"Was looking for a foodie spot on the strip and this is the place! Chicken lover's dream with plenty of choices including signature sandwiches and unique dipping sauces to dip your chicken in. Loved the wasabi and chipotle honey very new experience in taste for me. The prices are great and the food is delicious they even have alcoholic shakes if you're into that!"}
{"text":"The best food in Las Vegas  Great customer service. Delicious chicken and milkshakes. This is perfection."}
{"text":"I like this place so much that I looked for it on Yelp to leave a review. I've been ordering from Postmates for a couple of weeks and this is definitely the best fried chicken I've ever had in Nevada I've been here 19 years I've never had better Fried Chicken. The portions are gigantic the crust is delicious the chicken is moist and high-quality. No question this is one of the best fried chicken places. This is the kind of place that you eat at and then you tell your friend hey you have to try this. I couldn't imagine someone would eat this fried chicken and give it only three stars. I actually read the negative review to see what they were even talking about. I don't review a lot if you look me up you'll be able to see but when I do it's usually great. My mom said if you can't say something nice don't say anything.  this place I have to say something because it really is fresh high-quality amazing food."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and been wanting to try this every time I'm in New York. This location is conveniently located below Bally's hotel. I got the two piece dark with fries. It usually comes with fries and coleslaw. The fries was thin, very crispy and flavorful. One of the best fries I've eaten. As for the chicken, the skin was crispy and tasty but the meat was a bit bland. I was surprised will the sauces available. Never thought honey based sauce would taste so good. My favorite was the chipotle honey."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I got to visit this little joint during my stay in Vegas! This place was fairly cheap with really huge portions. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the fries....they were super duper crispy and seasoned perfectly. I also had their cheeses supreme burger (i love cheese!!!!) and it was to die for. The fried chicken patty was crispy and juicy...... I definitely need another burger right now haha. If I ever come back to Vegas I will for sure stop by again and try their fried chicken wings."}
{"text":"Not too bad honestly. I kept thinking this place looked like a knock off Popeyes, but the chicken is decent for what you're paying (Vegas prices).   Ordered the 4 piece meal, which is a breast, whole wing, drumstick, and thigh. Price comes in at $17.95, cheaper than if you got the dark meal and the white meat meal as separate orders.  Meal comes with fries and coleslaw. Added a side of smoked mac n cheese (extra) bringing my order to around $23. I mean, more than I'd pay for chicken at home, but not the most expensive meal I've eaten on the strip by far.   Heavy on the seasoning, but the breast was really large and juice and so was the wing. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the fries were really really good. I'm not a coleslaw person so I skipped the slaw. Overall, good food with an okay price."}
{"text":"Chicken was okay but not worth the wait. I waited 17 minutes for a 2 piece dark with sweet potato fries and a chicken sandwich that was cold and soggy, also when I went up to the counter to ask about my order I over hear a conversation between a woman who looked like she may have been a manger or supervisor and a cook about prostitution , using profanity. Very unprofessional and disgusting. The staff was apologetic about the inconvenience they gave us extra chicken to make up for the missing thigh than later brought it out to us when it was ready."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not the best chicken on the strip. We ordered chicken strips and fries... the chicken was hard / over cooked and the breading was soft and mushy. The fries are great and crispy. The bbq sauce and honey chipotle sauce are on point."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken sandwich I had , went back following day for a repeat. The sauce in the sandwich is incredible and the chicken is perfect! Will definitely be back next time Iam in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"That bomb chicken!!! if you're in Vegas check this place out. If You don't know what to get just ask their staff and they will give you a good choice.."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken when I was in NY but never got a chance.  I recently went on a trip to vegas and saw that they opened one in LV! I got the chicken sandwich and it was delicious!  The sauce and chicken went together perfectly!  I really love the sauce and the fresh and juicy lettuce! Great place! Love their chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"We happened to walk by Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken while walking down the strip.  We already had dinner earlier and it wasn't quite time for a snack but I had to stop and try it.  I ordered a kid's meal with a strip and fries and a chicken wing.  It wasn't busy so our trip was ideal.  My husband and I sat down at a communal table.  The table has a collection of bbq sauces and honeys.  We taste tested all of them.  Chipotle honey was my favorite.  The strip was good, I had a bite and my husband finished the rest.  The fries were good too.  My favorite though was the wing.  It was tender and tasty.  It had more flavor than the strip.  The batter is light, crispy, and not greasy.  The problem is I only had one but I sure did enjoy it.  Next time in Vegas, I'm having more than one wing."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was horrible. Ordered our food and had to wait almost 20 minutes for entire table to get orders called. It was done and ready just didn't get called and got cold. There was plenty of people working but none of them seemed to be doing much...."}
{"text":"Quick stop on our way to planet Hollywood and it was amazing!!!! Thin, crispy fries and deliciously juicy fried chicken. Fantastic seasoning AND a wide variety of sauces on the side. The chipotle honey is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good fried chicken on the strip.  Its fast (for the most part), decently priced, and super tasty. The fries are shoestring style. Their sandwiches are also tasty.  It looks like each chicken is individually seasoned when it comes out of the fryer.  Another plus is that they are open late."}
{"text":"Good for late night eats, but chicken is just ok. I wasn't blown away, but it was late and I was hungry so it was good for what it was."}
{"text":"Large menu with lots of chicken options. We opted for chicken tenders which were crispy, juicy, and cooked well. We ordered the fries with bacon and cheese which was definitely worth it!!! My only feedback would be I would prefer a thicker and crispier coating on the chicken. Overall an awesome menu!"}
{"text":"So far the best fried chicken I've had in Las Vegas, and yes I've had some by others at higher prices who claimed to be the best.  Both dark meat and white meat.  Not much room inside the small place in the Great Bazaar shops, but service was quick and friendly.  Beer was good, cold, and generous too.  Nice selection of sauces (hot and/or sweet types) on the tables."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick meal and decided to give it a try. The staff was very friendly even with the location being very busy. I only tried the tenders and fries. I found the tenders to be very dry, I am sure many people like them like this, just not my thing. Where they have it nailed for me is in the honey based sauces. WOW. I will be back to try some other menus items and update my review."}
{"text":"One of my favorite for a quick meal in vegas!  I am from Texas, so I want flavor and spice!  The sauces turn the chicken from great to amazing, and the loaded fries were delicious!! My husband had one of the sandwiches, and it was really good.  Great location, very casual for a quick snack!!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town. Fries are amazing as well. Takes a while to get food and service was a little weird, but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Chicken had seasoning on both the skin anddddddd the actual chicken! Imagine such a concept lol I ordered the dark meat 2 piece which was great.  Not a fan of the skinny fries but that should not stop anyone from coming since this is a chicken joint! I have heard their smoked Mac and Cheese was popping but I haven't tried it myself.  If you are in the Bally's plaza stop by to experience the chicken."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit! Me and the lady stopped her for lunch. We both got chicken sandwiches and shared a large loaded fry. Everything was delicious. The sauces they have on the tables are amazing and acompany the crispy fried chicken so well.  The only issue here are the prices. Two sandwiches and a large order of fries shouldn't cost over $35, even if it is on the strip. I believe the fries alone we're $14."}
{"text":"uhh-mazing. Chicken, fries and drinks were great. Ate here twice in one day. Love me some good yard bird."}
{"text":"This place knows their chicken! Everything was delicious!  Great customer service. Thanks Chad!"}
{"text":"If you love fried chicken and don't want to spend an arm and a leg on the strip, this place is fantastic. The chicken is SOOO good. Super crispy. Just the right amount of spice. My only caveat is, if you're not a huge fan of breading, I wouldn't recommend this. It's definitely not a \"light coat\".  They have a nice assortment of sauces for you to try, but honestly I think the chicken is fine on its own. They also have some cane sugar colas which are awesome but they don't give free refills which I personally think is kinda BS, but it is the strip so it is what it is.   You can't really eat anywhere \"cheap\" on the strip, but two people can get out of here for under $30 and definitely feel satiated, which is more than you can ask for a lot of other places. Plus, there's plenty of seating. If you can't find a spot inside or outside the restaurant, off to the side by Giordano's there's more."}
{"text":"9 dlls for a chicken sandwich, i expected more for that,we order 2 piece combo abd the sandwich, it took around 20 mins to get my food,service is crappy,sandwich cold,ask for easy ice on my drink,was my first time here,it will be my last."}
{"text":"I've had this spot bookmarked for a while now. The strip crowds and other madness has kept me away... HOWEVER I had my mind made up that tonight was the night. We made the drive and traveled through the redefined concrete jungle known as the strip. Once we rounded the corner I could see the signs shinning bright and from a bustling business. We could see that it was clearly busy because the building is basically a giant class LEGO piece( DECOR: modern, bright, gameshow meets New York City).   We made our way towards the register and we were greeted by about 4 employees anxiously awaiting to assist us. I ordered ITEM after ITEM after ITEM. The chances of me making this trip again are about slim to none anytime soon... SOOOO why not gorge out on premium chicken and such.   Tenders, wings, sandwiches and old school cola drinks. Instant happiness!    In the end my ultimate suggestion... PURCHASE A BEAK TO BUTT to go on your way out. If you plan on drinking and hangin that is perfect A.M. Hangover food thank me later ."}
{"text":"Located outside of Bally's.  Good, freshly fried chicken.  So good and open until 2:00am to help satisfy late-night cravings.  Crispy crunchy on outside and moist and tender on the inside.  Seating is limited inside, but there are tables with umbrella covers outside.  Or you can have it to go.  The fries are thinly cut and irresistible.  They offer a few sauces to go with the meal."}
{"text":"While fried chicken may not be my favorite food on earth, this place definitely offers the best drumsticks I've ever had.  They are crispy and juicy at the same time. I also loved their seasoning. My friend also loved their chicken sandwich. Friendly workers too! We went there during early lunch time, and we got served pretty fast. I will definitely recommend if you like fried chicken."}
{"text":"As i wandered the slightly maze like Grand Bazaar shops at Ballys in early afternoon trying to decide what to eat, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken caught my eye, the look of the place is cool and casual. Great music playing too! While the chicken sandwiches looked fantastic on the menu, I kept it real simple and just ordered a (bone in) Chicken Breast (visible behind the counter), and it was fantastic! Chicken was tender and spices were great, a nice crunch and not too greasy. Nice selection of drinks and there is a water station inside which is a nice touch. It was a satisfying and quality quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I came here for a yelp elite event a few weeks prior. The food was good. I appreciated the service, and the drinks were pleasant. So when I was asked what I wanted for dinner we were in the same vicinity so this place was an obvious choice to come back too. Now let's talk about the parking..... THERE AINT NONE. This spot is technically located in the Grand Bazzare Shoppes so to park anywhere near the place you would have to park in the parking garage at A) Paris Hotel  B)Bally's or C) do what we did and parked AAAALLL the way down the street for some free parking and spent a little bonding (walking) time getting to the place. Ha   Anyways it's located the farthest from the street and it's sort of tucked in the back so finding it is a little difficult. Considering I've been there before I knew exactly where it was with no problem. So when you walk in you go to the counter and order up there, they give you one of those beeper type of things to tell you when your order is ready and then you wait from there. The menu is very straightforward. Chicken, Chicken sandwhiches, Chicken tenders, Salad which you can add chicken too. LOL they had a few other things that could be customized but the general premise is the same. I ordered the two tenders and fries meal (8.95 ish) and normally for a few tenders and some fries I wouldn't spend 10 bucks but these things are HUGE and they pile the fries HIGH. Our wait wasn't too long and when it did come out it was piping hot. Like you could see the grease still popping on the tenders HOT. It came with a small side of cole slaw and on the table you have your options of loads of different sauces. My favorite is the chipotle honey mixed with hot sauce and some bbq sauce. Everything was great. The service was excellent. I swear the lady taking our order was so helpful to me and my friend. Explained everything, and was so patient with us.   Honestly I don't even think I finished my entire meal. (think they threw in an extra tender for our wait).My signs of a good restaurant experience is if I leave full and happy. Don't forget to check out their drinks too. I had a hibiscus margarita and it was tangy, crispy, and packed a decent punch. All in all. 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service sucks tho! Like 6-8 people \"working\" and it took about 15 mins for 2 chicken tenders and fries! The food was bomb but come on in what world does \"fast food\" take that long. If they cut down on the talking and did their job that would be nice."}
{"text":"Simple fried chicken can be solved when you visit Blue Ribbon. They also offer sandwiches. The location is relatively small but it works and the chicken is seasoned well with a little kick in the skin to make it a bit spicy but not overly. The fries are really good too."}
{"text":"Located in the back corner of the Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops (if you're entering from the Las Vegas Blvd. side), this chicken joint completely threw me for a loop.  I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  Since I've been on a bit of a bacon kick lately, I decided to try THE PIT (crispy fried chicken sandwich with aged cheddar, smoked bacon and BBQ sauce)... Whoa!  I was blown away by the juiciness of the chicken breast.  The hearty bun was toasted slightly but still soft.  The cheese, the BBQ sauce, the Chipotle honey... the service, the wait time... it was all spot-on.  That $9.75 delectable monster barely fit in my hands but I managed!  The stringy fries were fresh, as was the coleslaw.  Beverage-wise, that Boylan's Diet Cane Cola was leagues better than any diet soda I typically drink.    When it was all over, I actually enjoyed watching the futuristic-looking trash compactor do its thing... ha!   This was the last meal before my return flight home, so I was definitely glad to cap off my Vegas trip on such a high note.                   I'm honestly racking my brain to try and think one thing I did not like... but I've come up empty-handed.  Even at $17 for everything I had, it's still significantly cheaper than most restaurants on the strip.  Bravo, BRFC!!  So... when are you coming to Orlando?"}
{"text":"I might be the only person who orders chicken tenders and salad- both were so good. I love the spice and crunchiness of the chicken and the shoestring fries were crunchy and delicious. BBQ sauce mixed w hot sauce was amazing. Weirdly the salad was fresh and yummy too."}
{"text":"Went for a quick stop yesterday. I grabbed a drumstick and smoked Mac and cheese! Both were great but the reason I cared to write a review was because of the Mac and cheese. My husband is a Mac and cheese lover and this one really stood out. It has smoked cheese in it which really elevated it. It was also a great price for a quick snack. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a night strolling the Strip. Mainly because it was one of the only places open. A bit pricey but the chicken was actually pretty good. Beverages could have been better as this place doesn't offer Coke or Pepsi products but an alternative that has Cane Sugar if I'm not mistaken.  The sauces available to put on your chicken is pretty good, lots of variety. Try the Chipotle one, it was my favorite of them all. There is plenty of space to eat as you can also sit outside if you want some fresh air. Once order is placed there is a short wait to pick up your food. Just about enough time to find a seat and sample your beverage. Overall, it's Vegas and it's on The Strip so it's overpriced but when it's after Midnite, your options are limited."}
{"text":"Looking for value for your money in Las Vegas can be a challenge. The gallery of shops and restaurants by Bally's are easy to miss if you are caught up in the crowd heading up and down the strip. Take a sidestep in from the sidewalk and head straight to the back. It's worth it!   We are in but noticed a brisk take out business with lots of locals. Always a good sign. Lots of tables inside and out.  Long family style seating and lots of seats at the bar.  They are licensed so cocktails, draft including some small brews and loaded shakes are all options.  The menu provides alot of options for number of pieces and white or dark meat.  Sandwiches are huge in fresh buns with loads of dressings.  Coleslaw is the non creamy variety, my favorite. Now the sauce, I believe there was 5 including a wasabi and straight up honey.  Service 5*.  These guys are in it. Fast organized and friendly.  Highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I'm giving Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken a solid 5 stars just for being open till 2am in the morning.  But it's really all about their fried chicken.  I've had Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken before at Brooklyn Bowl and I still believe to this day that it's my favorite Fried Chicken ever!  So it was no-brainer for me to stop by their new eatery at the Grand Bazaar Shops which was conveniently located at Bally's where I was staying.  I came in late night at around 1am.  Although I was tempted to try their sandwiches, I was really in the mood for their fried chicken so I got their 4-piece combo meal that came with fries and coleslaw.  4-Piece Combo Meal -- http://bit.ly/2lhtUAn Sooo gooood!  The chicken was fried perfectly with crispy skin and had a ton of flavor.  Plus the sauces were totally enhanced the flavor, especially the wasabi honey.  It's just as good as their chicken from Brooklyn Bowl, but minus the table service and the bowling.  I definitely plan on coming back to Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken again next time I'm in Vegas to try their sandwiches which all look awesome!  And for sure, I'll be back again for another round of their Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas over the weekend for my best friends birthday with all of my close friends. We were looking for a place to eat that was close to our hotel and not too pricey. We stumbled across this place. The interior was simple and it was easy to order. One of the men working was very helpful and suggested I try the Blue Ribbon Sauce. My chicken was cooked perfectly, fries were generously portioned, but the sauce definitely gave it that perfect kick. I also tried the Mac n cheese which was VERY cheesy. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Didn't end up eating here. Prices were out of this world! Should be shown as $$$$ small place and very little place to sit."}
{"text":"Not sure they are world famous yet, but if they keep expanding, they will be!    You can't go wrong here - great location and the staff is super friendly with great service.  The food is reasonably priced, even in a location where you would expect it to be over the top.    Succulent, juicy and flavorful the chicken is excellent.  I suggest staying with the actual chicken pieces instead of the tenders, they had better texture and realistically, the same amount of meat.  The combos come with fries and slaw, but you can sub double fries for the slaw - which I snuggest you do as they are perfectly crispy, crunch and delicious while the slaw is a bit bland.  They have multiple sauces available, be sure to try out the spicy honey."}
{"text":"Not impressed... but then we weren't hungry either, we just wanted to try it.   Service was super slooowww, and from the time we walked in, 2 employees (could have been mgmt or owners) were chatting with a patron & didn't move an inch.  Meanwhile, our 2 strips & 1 drumstick took about 10-15 minutes to come out... AND this is a fast food type of joint.  I mean, we appreciate getting hot, fresh food, but when others are standing around doing nothing while the kitchen is backed up??!!  Not cool.    The drumstick was decent & well seasoned... the strips were whack!  They do have unique sauce options, but the chicken should be the star, not the sauces.   Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I've never had chicken that tasted quite like this! Would I ever get this chicken again if I'm in Vegas? No. But it's for a personal reason. I hate any type of spice/heat period! I have been drink for the last few hours and my boyfriend decided to stop here so I can absorb some of this alcohol. This place is located in the shopping area outside of Ballys hotel. The menu is a decent size and but the restaurant itself is small. The chicken is coated with a seasoning that has heat to it. This is what I didn't like. However, the strips I had were still good after I removed the skin. Also, the fries are great! They have many different sauces for your dipping pleasure. We didn't wait too long and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich I've had... best chicken wings I've ever had this place is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! This was great,  lots of flavor and friendly staff.  I have a sensitivity to eggs and the staff and the manager knew what was in the coleslaw and followed up once I got my order to make sure I was enjoying the meal.  Also,  the chipotle honey on their chicken is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place best part was the fries and all the different types of honey dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. Sodas are local and awesome and you can't miss with fries with the works. If you a want quick meal this is the place."}
{"text":"I love the chicken wings here!  We went on Monday night, it wasn't busy at all. I ordered the Blue Ribbon sandwich and a wing (just to try). The sandwich was good, had a lot of flavor. The chicken wing was great, I loved it. It was crispy and seasoned very well. Next time I go here I think I will do a wing combo vs. a sandwich, both were good, I just prefer the wings over the sandwich, They had a few different house made (I think) hot sauces to try. The fries were okay.   This location in particular is small, but they have outdoor seating if you can't find a spot inside. The staff were very friendly, they greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. The food is made to order, so there's a little wait, but it wasn't too long, Maybe 10 min. I guess for Vegas the prices aren't too bad, especially being on the Strip.  I would love to here again someday!"}
{"text":"Stopped off at the Blue Ribbon during my short stay at the Cosmopolitan. I was pleasantly surprised with this new restaurant, it did not disappoint! My husband ordered the fried chicken, that came with mashed potatoes- delish!! I couldn't choose, everything looked amazing so I opted for the Pu Pu platter. It included one of each item: buffalo chicken wing, rib, fried oyster (wasn't too crazy about this one), duck egg roll and chicken on a stick. Spoiler, it came out with this really cool sterno thingy where you can cook the ribs to your liking. Really, really cool! Highly recommend this place, staff was awesome and food was delish. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came across this spot while searching for new places to try out on Yelp. After looking at the photos and reading reviews I decided to try this place out this past weekend.   They have a fairly large menu with all sorts of chicken items on it. From sandwiches to wings and tenders, sides, salads, milkshakes, Boozy shakes, shots, alcohol drinks and of course fountain drinks. Many of the items on the menu I wanted to try but decided on the Firebird sandwich since I was looking for something spicy.   The Firebird sandwich is a sandwich made with a crispy chicken piece (mine was huge!), shredded lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, pickled peppers which are jalapenos, and a spicy Chipotle sauce all on a toasted bun. Cost $8.75. The chicken was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. It could've used a little more salt, but that's nothing I couldn't add myself. The chipotle sauce was tasty without overpowering the whole sandwich. My only problem with the sandwich was the number of jalapenos they put on it. The jalapenos were terribly hot and they added oh so many of them on my sandwich. My mouth was on fire, so I had to take off 90% of the jalapenos. So, if you don't like spicy, don't get this sandwich. I'll probably ask for fewer jalapenos next time I get this.   My guest got the Cheesy Supreme sandwich and made it a combo. He added a small order of \"Fries with the works\". All combos come also with cole slaw. The Cheesy Supreme sandwich is made with a crispy chicken piece, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, your choice of 2 kinds of cheese and Blue Ribbon Special Sauce. His combo cost just under $14.   The Fries with the works are made of crispy fries and topped with aged cheddar, smoked bacon, and sour cream. The small order was more than big enough for 2 people to share, especially when you have one of those HUGE sandwiches.   The inside was very clean and organized. They had a selection of different kinds of honey and hot sauces at each of the seating areas as well as at the Hot sauce table. They offer ice water for free to their customers, which is very nice on hot days here. Their trash can is a trash compactor. First time I've seen this.   Employees were friendly and very knowledgeable of the items on their menu.   Can't wait to come back. Definitely, a must-try stop if you're in town and love chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered two chicken sandwiches they were good, the fries were perfect nice and crispy. Great place on the strip for a quick bite"}
{"text":"One of the best darn chicken sandwiches ever !  I ordered the cheesy supreme and added smoked bacon! Chicken was cooked to order and was served piping hot with oooey gooey melted cheddar and American cheese, with what seemed like a marinated beefsteak tomato, house made pickled cucumbers , fresh shredded lettuce and a delicious (egg?) bun, and thick cut smoked bacon, perfection !! The fries were piping hot and good , but maybe a thicker cut as an option as they cooled off fast and became crunchy and cold ! While hot they were delicious once cold I threw half away , same for the sweet potato fries, the coleslaw was bland and vinegary ! The real star is the chicken !! Maybe get sides at wahlburger or one of the other restaurants in the bazaar shops?  But I would definitely go back just for the chicken and chicken sandwiches !!"}
{"text":"The best chicken I can recall I've had in many months! Those hush puppies were the best ever!! I wanted to sneak all those flavored honey bottles but my purse was too small lol... I may try to buy a franchise! It was that good!"}
{"text":"Since everyone was going crazy over this chicken, I figured I needed to try it! So, I brought my friend from out of town to eat for dinner.   The location itself is perfect if you're on the Strip. It's tucked away in the Bally's Bazaar. There are a few table seats and a bar seating area. It was relatively small, so we had to eagle-eye for a table. There was a sauce station in the corner and sauces on every table.   I ordered the AM-PM sandwich, which is the January special of the month. It was very good. The chicken was actually fantastic. It was extremely tasty and full of flavor.   The three star review is entirely because of the service. I would give one star for the staff, but the food was too good. So, they entirely messed up my order. I ordered the AM-PM sandwich, the Rancher, a side of corn bacon, a small beer, and a large drink. They gave me mac-n-cheese instead of the corn bacon. They charged me for a large beer ($15!) and forgot the large drink entirely, even though they charged me for it. I figured since the beer was already poured, I would just drink it. I mean, more beer is always fine with me. I think my friend got a different sandwich than he ordered, but he was fine with whatever at that point. The food took a long time, so I didn't even bother complaining about the mistakes in the food. Just not sure how so many things were incorrect from my order.   It was pretty expensive for being chicken sandwiches. The total for the above order was $45. However, I understand that it was on the Strip and the alcohol alone was $15. So, it was okay. I would say the prices are comparable for Strip prices. Just not sure I would pay for it again.   Overall, the food was great. Pricey, but great. The staff was very disappointing. I would give this place another shot but probably at the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"I work at Wahlburgers right next door so I come here a lot during my lunch break. While I haven't tried a lot on the menu yet I can easily say this is the best fried chicken I've ever had. I've never loved fried chicken, but I find myself craving this place. It's pricey for sure but it's also on the strip. I like that they let me have extra fries instead of the coleslaw. They also have some good dipping sauces. Their homemade ranch is really good and their chipotle honey is so delicious. I'm so glad this place opened up next to my job."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say I have a very disappointing review, based on the other reviews I thought this would be good.   We ordered sides of the smoked Mac and cheese. They were out. So we ordered sweet potato and loaded fries.   Were they good? I have no idea. They screwed up my sandwich (the rancher) by not adding the extra cheese I paid for or any ranch on it. By the time I got it corrected, fries were soggy and cold.   Hope your experience is better. We would not give this place another try"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a chicken sandwich.. especially when it's bigger than your mouth! There are multiple locations but the location on the strip is perfect for a meal after a night out. They have indoor and outdoor seating if you need some fresh air. The Bloody Mary was amazing and I highly recommend! The best part is you can always take it to go if you don't finish before your meal. There are many sandwich options and I don't think you could go wrong. The proportions are big but don't forget to add a side of fries. They also have a few different sauces you can add which are on the tables The range in flavor and spices. Don't pass this place up when you're on the strip!"}
{"text":"I love that the chicken is all natural! This place is really passionate about using natural ingredients in their cooking and beverages. Mike at the strip location was soo nice, informative and hospitable."}
{"text":"Strolling the strip a few weeks ago and it was hot. Real hot. I needed some comfort food as the night before was a good but long one. So fried chicken was on my menu. I usually hit up Popeyes, but I'm in Vegas, i can have Popeyes anywhere. And lets be honest, that can always be hit or miss depending on which one you go to. Blue Ribbon was amazing! Great quality big pieces of chicken and fried to perfection! Im a thigh man so i devoured two pieces & some bomb mac n cheese. I struck up a conversation with the store manager to get some info about their history and he couldn't have been more friendly and insightful. Gave me their history and even showed me how to properly mix the various honeys & hot sauces to get the maximum signature flavor. Next time im on the strip im definitely going back! They even have a walk up bar so you can walk the strip with a PBR and a drumstick in your hand lol"}
{"text":"Damn good fried chicken. One of my friends made it a point to stop by this place during our most recent trip to Vegas and it was the perfect midday meal before transitioning into nightlife mode.   Everything was delicious, so it doesn't matter if you went with the chicken tenders, the wings, or a chicken sandwich. Pieces were seasoned well and  breaded perfectly with just enough crunch on the outside, but soft and tender on the inside.   It was early February at the time and it was hot as hell inside. I don't know if the ac wasn't working but if the temperature is like that all year round, you might want to eat outside or get your food to go."}
{"text":"Great place! The chicken has great flavor, it's a little hidden gem  you won't regret going and the price are not to bad either"}
{"text":"* If you're having trouble finding this place - it's in the rows of shops outside Bally's, known as the Grand Bazaar. This is a popular stop in New York, and I'm happy to see it on The Strip (.. and Summerlin)!  Basics: - Order at the counter and sit down or take it to go - Price Range / Person: $12 - $18 (without alcohol) - Any meal listed + side should fill you up - Classics include drumsticks and the Firebird sandwich (there are also seasonal specials not-so-obviously posted around) - Their sauces are great to amplify flavor profile that you enjoy  Critiques of this location:  - The buns on my sandwich was cold and flavorless; it seriously put a damper on my meal, so I just took them off - No one wiping down the tables consistently; did not happen in the hour that I was there"}
{"text":"What i dont get is why dont a lot of peeps know about this place? Shame on them cuz they be missing out on a gold chicken mine. Got my usual firebird and fries which taste exactly how it has in the past. This shows the consistency of their food, unlike some places where it may be good one day but bad the next. Normally i only eat at a place once during a trip, but last week i came here twice cuz its that damn good. #blueribbonchickenarmyYO"}
{"text":"Look, folks, you're in Vegas: Even when buying fried chicken, the deck is stacked against you. But that doesn't mean loosing cannot be fun, or delicious! After an evening of drinking rum and coke, a little blue ribbon fried chicken and side of mac'n cheese was the perfect companion to bring back to my room (and certainly not the most expensive, unhealthy alternative)."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today while we were on vacation in Las Vegas. This place is absolutely delicious if you're looking for an over the top chicken place. We had the sandwiches, mine was a special with chopped bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar, and macaroni and cheese.. My bf had the one with bacon and ranch. We also got the loaded fries with chopped bacon, sour cream, and cheese.. It was all delicious but it is also a billion calories.."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken and cheap by Vegas standards!  Super crispy, super juicy.  Nicely seasoned as well.  I'm not a sauce-on-fried-chicken-guy but they had an assortment of BBQ sauces and honey.  Definitely worth a visit for a snack, especially when the post-imbibing munchies hit!"}
{"text":"Delicious shoe string fries! I could not stop eating them. The chicken treated fresh and moist with a light breading and seasoning. Free dipping sauce as well. A little pricey but still great good!"}
{"text":"We stumbled up on this spot while walking down the strip and the food was good.  I enjoyed the chicken strips and fries.  Good flavor and many other good choices. Only 2 chicken strips though, need to add 1 more to make this meal complete. the service was good also."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers I've ever had. Customer service can be hit and miss sometimes. Sometimes they're super nice and inviting other times it seems as if they don't care but over all real good chicken!"}
{"text":"Delicious fired chicken. I had breast, wing large slaw and cold beer. Awesome. The chicken spice was really good. I but bbq and honey wasabi sauce on side for dipping. So good. I highly recommend. I will be back. Please open one of these joints in San Jose you will make a killing."}
{"text":"We walked by here looking for the Lush store. My girlfriend love chicken so what the heck. We ended up destroying the chicken, it was fantastic. The fries are also splendid, the portion was huge."}
{"text":"This is becoming my bad habit. Ordering the chicken tenders allows me to sop up all the Chipotle honey sauce I desire, without being asked to leave. This makes a great cheat meal if you're on some sort of calorie-restricted diet."}
{"text":"Locals tend to stir away from the strip except for special events or shows... I'm not one of them. So, as someone that loves the chaos of the LV Blvd, it is frustrating to go some of the strip area restaurants only to be disappointed that quality and taste is not high priority... I'm guessing, gearing towards tourist and not for repeat customers. BLUE RIBBON FRIED CHICKEN is not one of those overpriced and underwhelming tourist trap. This fast casual place is not only, over the top with customer service, the atmosphere is modern and comfortable and the food is absolutely delicious at affordably prices. We have had the whole pieces of fried chicken and the chicken strips. Both, are equally as good. The fries are addictive. Looking forward to trying the mac n cheese on our next visit. I can't stress enough, how this place really is worth the wait. They also have adult spirits which is a nice plus! By far, the BEST Blood Mary I have had since being in Vegas. YES, for real! Listen, the Grand Bazaar area is full of tourist trap restaurants... trust me, I been to them all. This really is the only one worth the walk."}
{"text":"Long wait for dry chicken, thin greasy fries. Refused refills on soda which made it impossible to finish the dry chicken.  Took most of it in a to go box, but never brought myself to finish it so now it is in the trash.  Very expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of there oily chicken. Fries were the string size. Nothing special about the fatty chicken. Seems like battered and fried then some Cajun seasoning. For a quick bite, then ok, but there is a lot of people that are eating in this place."}
{"text":"VIVA las chicken. Probably the best fried chicken in Las Vegas. Fantastic service as well. There was a slight hiccup with my order, and the situation was rectified 10 fold. Go eat some CHICKEN!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit pricey but I believe worth the price.  Chicken was crispy, moist, meaty & delicious .  You are given a huge pile of hot crispy shoe string fries . Added flavor profile honey sauce at the table in squeeze bottles."}
{"text":"This.Chicken.Be.Poppin. Every bite is seasoned to perfection. Whatever sauce they use on these sandwiches...BOMB xoxo EatWithReese"}
{"text":"Indeed the best fried chicken I've ever had in US, period. The only problem is that it is tooooo crowded! And the service speed suffers from that."}
{"text":"Ordering is fast. But long wait. Waited 30 min for our food. Order was so disorganized. I don't get why. Order was messed up. Just for tender and fries... didn't get the fries. Friend got a burger which was cold. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place was okay.  I've been to both this location and the one in downtown Summerlin.  Both places were fine but failed to impress.    There was limited outdoor and indoor seating.  I could see it being a problem in the colder months.  Service was great, and the employees in the front and servers were all pleasant.  I ended up getting the dark chicken combo.  For both locations, the chicken was whelming, while the fries were super tasty.  I wouldn't come back though, when there's a multitude of low cost comfort food places around the strip and around town.  If you're near either location and want fried chicken, it's not a bad bet.  Otherwise, I'd make the drive to Raisin Cane's for both price, quantity and flavor."}
{"text":"The food here was good, and for the amount you get wasn't too expensive. The chicken tenders were a bit on the dry side, but the flavor was still solid. Will probably try the dark meat combo next time. The Fries with The Works are what will be bringing me back, though. Not shy with the toppings at all, and somehow the fries managed to stay crispy. The inside is super tiny, so not great for big groups."}
{"text":"This is some good chicken. Popeye's who? We landed and checked into the room and came out to get some lunch. Coming down the escalators of Bally's, you'll see the Blue Ribbon sign. My brother and I both said we heard this was good, so we ate here.  We got the 4 piece mix - Wow, nice seasoning and the breast meat was actually moist. Plenty of skinny fries. I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw though...needs work too me.  We came back the last day of our trip and ended up getting the 6 piece wings. Nice size and still yummy!  Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food, I had the firebird & the chicken breast was perfectly cooked, moist, juicy & flavorful! The toppings worked perfectly together. The shoestring fries are AMAZING too!"}
{"text":"Love the food here!!   Located at the Bazaar in front of Starbucks, this cute chicken restaurant is a great place to stop in and get something quick and delicious to eat.   I came here last weekend and got the Cheesy Supreme chicken sandwich and the Fries with the works. They made it a combo, so it also came with a small coleslaw and I got a lemonade. The portions are much larger than I expected, so I wasn't able to finish everything and ended up sharing my fries.   The chicken sandwich came with 2 choices of cheese on the crispy chicken piece along with lettuce and tomato and their special sauce. Fries are made of cheddar, bacon and sour cream..can I say YUM!! Both the chicken sandwich and fries were delicious and I would definitely get them again.   Inside the restaurant, there are plenty of seating for you and a guest, but it's not big enough to have large groups of people. There are tables outside for those that have bigger groups of people eating here. Each of the inside tables has a collection of hot sauces and flavored honey as well as the hot sauce bar.   Employees here are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"You know it's a good sandwich when you have more chicken then bread lol.  The chicken was juicy, fresh and filling. The bread was soft and light. The toppings were cut fresh and the pickle tasted homemade.  Add a side of sweet potato fries and cole slaw for $2.  They are definitely known for their juicy chicken but their honey based sauce selection tops it off. Wasabi Honey and Chipotle Honey were my favorite. You will walk away perfectly full and satisfied.  Only downside is the drinks are not refillable the milkshake tasted like soft serve but was pricey.  Just go for the chicken!"}
{"text":"These by far are the best chicken wings and sandwich I've had in my life. Seriously, I came back twice in one day. Tiffany is the best bar tender and was awesome."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was on point, crispy and fresh. French fries were thin cut and delicious. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Nommmm! I have a thing for fried chicken! Located at the Grand Bazaar Shops outside of Bally's Hotel.  Their fried chicken is crispy and seasoned very well. Also have unique sauces. The tangy BBQ one is lit! Should've took a bottle to go to dip my Popeyes Chicken in (Since there's no Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken where I live lol)"}
{"text":"Overall chicken was ok and the fries was awesome. I ordered the \"beak to butt\" which is supposed to be chef's choice. It basically has everything but chicken meat. I thought it'd be interesting to try other part of chicken fried. But, I was a little disappointed. The seasoning was good, but the chicken was too greasy. After a few bites I felt it was simply too much oil to eat. I had to throw out half of it. I'm curious to try other things on the menu, i.e. the ones with actual meat not the neck or butt."}
{"text":"Super crispy hot juicy and moist chicken that tastes great. Quick service and this place is always packed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but it is way too expensive for fast food. Even for the Strip. $16 for four pieces of fried chicken? $13 for a chicken sandwich? No thanks. The inside is very small and there are a few tables outside too. Maybe just try cleaning them once in a while!"}
{"text":"The food is ok at best. Looks better than it actually is. If it wasn't so expensive then it would be worth it. The price doesn't justify the quality of food for me"}
{"text":"Chicken was just ok. Good flavor, but just didn't have that crispy fried chicken texture. Fries were really good.  Skinny and crispy with lots of flavor. The price was kind of expensive...$10 for 2 small drumsticks and fries.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food here was good, and tastes fresh. The perfect meal after our Happy Hour on the High Roller."}
{"text":"I really have mixed emotions about this place. I heard about it from a personality on the Food Network so I thought it was a must have. Therefore, I made the trip.  Upon walking in it is loud and a bit small but there is seating outside. The next thing I noticed were the prices. There were close to Five Guys prices and it was over $30 for a beer, fries, two sandwiches and hush puppies. The sum of my Ranch sandwich was not impressive. It was a bit too much bread and I attribute this to the thin piece of chicken that was in it. It was much thinner than a Chik Fil A patty. The chicken was tasty so I would do a leg or breast the next time I visit if I do again. The fries were good but standard at best.   After leaving here, I felt underwhelmed. I feel it was overpriced and under portioned."}
{"text":"Got here with my girlfriend, $8 for burger, and $5 for fries with works (small). we ordered the one with cheese, and another one with  hot pepper. Some people will think that it is too expensive 8 dollars for a single sandwich, but I kind of felt that the price was reasonable. When you go onto Jack in the Box, you will expect to pay around 6-7 dollars for a sandwich. If I think about that, since this place is in Strip and the chicken was fresh too. We enjoyed our time there, food was great, there are seats outside too, so you may be able to get some breeze while you are eating there."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! After seeing countless posts on Instagram about this place, we decided to stop in! Hungover and hungry, we were so glad there wasn't a line on Thu afternoon. We tried the original sandwich and the firebird - both were delicious! Firebird has a little kick to it. Their fried are so good! String fries that are crispy have a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Great wing, just enough seasoning and mild enough to enjoy. Ate at the bar and service was awesome. Employee treat you like family."}
{"text":"Found this place on IG and after seeing the pictures I had to try it. I had a Hibiscus margarita. Fire bird sandwich filled with lettuce peppers spicy mayo cucumbers and tomatoes  it wasn't to spicy you felt the heat when you took a bite of the peppers and the cucumbers gave it a cooling effect, I added hot sauce to mine. Everything fries, had cheese bacon and sour cream. Mac and cheese and a chicken strip so we could try all of the different honey flavors. Definitely recommend and I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Went on a whim and went to Blue Ribbon after a night out, and it was the best decision we have ever made! The special sauce is amazing, as well as the smoked mac n cheese. The service was fast, and the employees were friendly. 10/10 would recommend this to anyone walking down the strip!"}
{"text":"This place is the best chicken spot that I have ever been to! The chicken is so flavorful. It's easily the best that I have ever tasted! Nothing is comparable. It is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"First place my girlfriend and I ate with some friends when we got to Vegas, got a recommendation to check this place out for their chicken. Order the chicken sandwich and the girlfriend got the two piece chicken plate. cole slaw was okay, chicken itself was moist and juicy, not dry at all. sandwich was delicious, the sauces were delicious you can fill your little cups. overall pretty good for what it is. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great flavor! A little pricey, but everything on the strip is expensive FYI.... The chicken had tons of flavor packed into each bite! I didn't want the experience to end. The fries were good too. I like their sauce selection. All of their sauces have a honey base, delicious."}
{"text":"I heard this was one good fried chicken spot from my folks in NYC. So while here in Vegas, I decided to give it a try. And it did not disappoint. Shoe string fries cooked the way I like them, crispy until the last fey; even with ketchup on it. Chicken was cooked well, succulent, juicy, crispy and flavorful. The hush puppies too were on point. Pieces of what looked like corn and carrots in them.  They have a variety of sweet sauces that go with everything. Over all, this was a great place, staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"DAY:  - Saturday for lunch.  LOCATION/INTERIOR:  - located in the shopping area right outside of Bally's.  - they have seating inside and outside.  ORDER & TASTE: * You order first then they will give you a buzzer for when your order is ready.  When you pay with card, there is a prompt to tip - I don't appreciate this system especially because of the service I received. I don't think they served the tip.  The girl taking the order was not friendly.   - 2 pc tenders ($9.95): this is the combo that comes with fries and coleslaw. Chicken itself was okay, wasn't dry so that was at least good. But presentation was terrible. If you like the thin strongly fries, it is pretty good. It was crispy. Still think it was expensive for the 2pc.  - fries the works small ($7.75): I honestly didn't think this was with it at all. It didn't like very appetizing and it was super oily.  Don't waste your money.  * For the price, didn't think the food was worth it.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  - was disorganized and did not seem like they had a system at all.  - waited forever for our food. Which is stupid since they already have stuff ready.   - once we got it, it wasn't event correct. Had to go back inside to get the missing item from our order."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best fried chicken eateries in Las Vegas! I've been here several times and the 30 minute drive is worth it. The parking lot is huge but good luck finding a close spot, just forget driving in circles and head to the back. What gets me is the people inside always appear to be people watching as you walk past the big glass windows.  The menu is simple. Get fried chicken or a chicken sandwich. Both are spectacular. Definitely try the fries with the works. I always order the blue ribbon sandwich with cheddar and an extra patty (huge but delicious). The sauces are OK. Seating has never been a problem, but the seats themselves I hate. They're like sticky picnic tables. You cannot wipe them down enough! Despite always leaving full and guilty about the huge caloric intake....I always come back."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  I always like to ask the people that work there what they like because they usually know what's good. I tried the blue ribbon sandwich and the rancher sandwich with the loaded fries and woah that was a party in my mouth. My boyfriend and I ate everything. I hate pickles but even the pickles were good. The staff was super friendly and helpful too"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and fries I've ever had! Huge sandwiches! Delicious sauces! Smoky barbecue is my favorite. Great coleslaw! Friendly staff, little wait time, and great food. This is our new go-to spot before a night of drinking in Vegas! Also... fantastic music: retro, 80s pop type!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to get delicious fried chicken and fries! My two favorite food!   Their style of fried chicken is deliciously seasoned and fried to perfection. It's crispy, golden brown, and moist, like how fried chicken should be. Their fries are thin, battered and crispy. The food goes so well with each other and it's the best comfort food you can get on the strip!  Try the chicken and fries with their honey sauces: wasabi or wildflower. Both honey are good, even the wasabi one was delicious (that's coming from someone who hates wasabi!)  This location is in the Grand Bazaar at Bally's, which is a new development of modern restaurants and shops that are open late. We came here around midnight and they were still open and happy to serve customers.   Apparently this brand is famous in NYC and Vegas, but being from California this is the first time we tried it since we were in Vegas during NYE weekend.  When I come back to Vegas, I'll hit this place up again and try other combos on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for a late midnight snack/dinner since they were open until 2am. I'm glad it was still open because it satisfied my savory cravings. I ordered the chicken wings with fries. The outer skin of the wings were crispy which is the way I love my wings. Fries were thinly sliced and soft. All went well with the Chipotle honey sauce: sweet with a kick of spice. I am taking 1 star away because there were napkins and garbage on the floor when I walked into the restaurant. I believe all restaurants should maintain a level of cleanliness, even if they are considered fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Man everyone talks about Yardbird but this place is on a whole entire level better then them"}
{"text":"The firebird was the perfect kick! The spiciness was just enough to keep you holding on to a cup of water with the other hand. Nice quick meal on the strip overall."}
{"text":"The chicken was good but it didn't really feel like a nice crunch or flaky or anything. Also the bread falls apart kind of easy and takes away from the sandwich. That was all okay to deal with but i also had the cheesy supreme and with a name like that I figured it had a lot of cheese but it didn't. It was 2 choices of cheese and it was an ok amount.  However, the loaded fries were amazing! Plenty of cheese and nice bacon but the addition of he sour cream it brings was soo good!   Prices were good with everything being at about $8 or $9 but honestly for a place known for the chicken, I was blown away by the fries and the chicken was just good to me. Worth trying but not sure of worth repeating. Maybe getting chicken pieces and not sandwiches would be better"}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich in the history of chicken sandwiches. Chick-Fil-A can go piss up a rope. This place is where it's at."}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious fried chicken and fries!! My friends and I landed in Vegas at around 9:30pm and were starving and wanted some quick, cheap, but good eats for the night. We stopped by this place and were all very satisfied. I got the chicken sandwich, and it was very flavorful. The chicken was well-seasoned and crispy. The sauces were also really good - I enjoyed the wasabi honey and chipotle honey. My friends got the chicken only (drums, wings, thighs), and also really enjoyed their meal. We all loved the thin, crispy fries! Overall, a great, affordable choice for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Blue Ribbons fried chicken has a pedigree to its sandwich but personally is hard to rate. If you don't mind paying extra for fast food than you're loving this spot. For two crispy sandwich meals it came out to $30. I felt that was kind of steep.The sandwiches were good but idk if it's a must have. It's more of an alternative goto.   I would give it a 3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken platters a little pricey but decent amount. 3 tender platter $13. I ate hush puppies and the smokehouse MAC and it was great."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations of this place and that did not help...  The chicken was okay and not the best fried chicken I've ever had.  The best part about this place is the honey... lots and lots of honey.  Different kinds and no limits (other than it takes a long time to pour honey).  The fries were good (a great way to scoop up more honey) but oddly way more than you would need.  I will give it another chance, but I don't have high hopes that it will beat Yardbird for Fried Chicken on the Strip anytime soon...  Ordered: Kerry's Classic The Drum Line w/ Sweet Potato Fries (two drumsticks)  Overall: Worth the try because of the hype, but if you really just want Fried Chicken you might want to check out Yardbird instead"}
{"text":"Passed by Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken while we were exiting Bally's (next to Starbucks), and made a mental note to try one day.   We passed by again, and ordered The Drumline ($9.95 2 drumstick combo) and The Wingman ($7.95 2 wing combo). All combos come with side of fries and cole slaw. Chicken was well seasoned and crispy, but the chicken to fries ratio is unbalanced. If you're actually hungry, you'll definitely need to order more chicken or try a sandwich. Love their skinny fries and slaw.  They had a good selection of sauces for your chicken, but the bbq was my favorite.   I'd definitely want to try their main restaurant at the Cosmo next time."}
{"text":"BOMB BOMB BOMB  Servers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Chicken is crispy and juicy.  Mac and cheese is on point.  Only negative is their soda was a bit flat.   Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tenders and they gave me something different, they gave me attitude about getting my order wrong, then charged me more to give me what I actually ordered, came out dry, and tasted horrible. Don't recommend. Bad food."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of semi-affordable options on the Strip that don't have wait times, so for that, Blue Ribbon serves a purpose. I love me some fried chicken, but I didn't think Blue Ribbon was spectacular by any stretch of the imagination.   The fries are good, and the chicken is solid (lots of pepper flavor!), but it's not lifechanging. The inside of the restaurant was pretty messy when we went (they're busy, I get it, but no one was cleaning up trays that looked like they had been sitting on tables for a while). The staff was also pretty unprofessional; any staff at a Shake Shack or In-n-Out would make this place look like McDonald's in terms of service.  If you've never been to a Blue Ribbon before, this is an \"order at the counter place\" that's pretty narrow inside and ultimately looks like a fast food restaurant (because it is). The chicken sits under lights, and they quickly grab it with tongs and give it to you. You can get food pretty fast as a result, but it's still hardly an upscale fast food place, which you'd expect after spending close to $20/person.   That being said, it serves a purpose. You can get food fast, and it has a lot of bready goodness. It's not fancy, but the fries are bomb, and the chicken is better than most fast food places. Is it worth going out of your way for? I'd say no, but if the craving hits and you just want something simple, it's worth a look."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for a late night meal after watching a show. It was Sunday night after 11 pm and there were quite a few people here. We ordered the 4 whole wings meal which comes with the wings, a huge portion of fries, and a small side of coleslaw. The fried chicken was only ok. It's definitely better than fast food chains but not the best I've had. The skin was crispy but there wasn't much flavor. I also wish they gave a larger portion of coleslaw to balance out the oil from the chicken and the fries. The only downside to this place was there was literally no more sauces out on the table and their sauce station had a lot of empty bottles. Overall, it was a decent late night meal but I probably would choose something else next time."}
{"text":"Okay I'm not sure if I was really hungry after my stroll down on the Vegas strip or what, but their fried chicken was so good!! Hey, we all know what fried chicken tastes like and will know a great one from a mediocre ones!!  They know how to produce good fried chicken that is moist, seasoned well, & fried well. All the sauces were awesome - my fav was the chipotle honey sauce! The lady who is in the front (young black lady) was so friendly! She was such a doll.  If you are looking for a lunch spot walking down the strip, make sure you check this place out! They truly deserve the blue ribbon for their fried chicken~"}
{"text":"Went with three cheesy supreme after reading reviews and it did not let down, very pleased. The \"Fries with the Works\" were excellent."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've had to date. The crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside with the perfect seasoning is the ultimate recipe. Vegas has so many great places to eat and I ate there 4 times in 3 days. Gonna miss you Blue Ribbon."}
{"text":"I hate giving a 2-star review. Majority of the deduction is due to the fact that I waiting around 30-minutes for 1-thigh and 1-drumstick. That's only 2 pieces of chicken. Went around 9:00PM and although there were several orders ahead of me, there was always chicken that was available that I saw on the rack. I'm not sure if orders are done in actual order, so I had to wait for them to come to mine. But if an order is small, such as mine, I'd think you'd get to that and move on to the next one.  I really wanted to try this place, since I heard the chicken was pretty good. And although I'm not going to say the chicken is junk, I wasn't wowed or ever thought to myself that I'd really want to come back because the flavor was unique or something I'd crave. To me, it was a one and done type of thing. And I hate saying that of any business. Flavor was good, but that's about it. Maybe the pieces that I had were flavored inconsistently? I'm not sure. But I did notice that a seasoning is shaked onto the chicken. Maybe mine wasn't addressed as much. And that's all that I think. Just so-so in flavor. Perhaps I *might* give them another chance, but only if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"The chicken taste great! Service is a little slow and prices are okay. Fries are also really tasty shoestring cut. The coleslaw is good but a small portion size of you order to go! I really like this place but am only giving three stars for the extremely slow service."}
{"text":"By far one of hands down best chicken sandwiches (chicken period for that matter) I have ever had in my entire life. The prices here are extremely generous for the quality of food they serve. Seating is limited however we went during lunch time during the week and had no issue getting a table outside in the cool breeze. Employees were very friendly/welcoming. Do yourself a favor and grab a Firebird sandwich to jump start your metabolism for all the alcohol consumption you will be doing."}
{"text":"I don't give a lot of 5-star reviews but every bite was better than the last at BRFC. Unreal delicious. I love fried chicken/chicken tenders etc, and these are the best of the best. Super juicy, amazing flavor. They look spicy/hot but they're not; they're just perfectly seasoned. You won't get a crunch like a battered tender, but instead it's almost like a crispy skin. The fries are good, but if you have to choose one side, opt for the smoked macaroni and cheese. I have no idea what kind of cheese they use, but it'll be my life mission to replicate this. O. M. G. 10/10 would order again. My husband got The Rancher and raved about it. Add this to your must-visit list in Vegas."}
{"text":"My new Fried Chicken FAVORITE!  OK so my hubby and I came into the strip on Saturday night and had parked at Bally's (note: it's not free parking-we paid $7 for a few hours)  Anywhoo with no intention of going out to eat, we saw this shop on the way down the escalators and thought why not as we'd heard great thing about it from the Yelp Elite crew that went (I missed out)  And I'm so glad we did!   We weren't starving - so I ordered the 1 wing and hubby got the thigh or was it breast... whatever it was he loved it. Thick and juicy - lol!  I love love the seasoning and my wing was perfect and moist too!   With it I ordered the Moscato and Modelo 24oz can and we were set!   Food was FABULOUS! Service was SENSATIONAL!  Staff were spot on service and you weren't standing around guessing. They were all very cool!   Thank you! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit this place I'm blown away by the quality of their food and service. Having never been a fan of fried-chicken *gasp* outside of a chicken finger basket Blue Ribbon won me over with their crispy skin and juicy interior.   The Firebird is one of my favorite sandwiches. You can win me over with any variation on a chipotle sauce. I am also a big fan of their Kale Salad. I was a bit wary of it because just about everyone is doing a kale something or other on their menu. The salad was a nice mix of healthy crunch with the fried chicken I was enjoying.  The food comes out fast, they serve Boylan natural sodas, and cocktails on draft. Their draft beer selection is a nice mix of national and local and might I recommend the Hazelberry boozy milkshake. It's a blend of Nutella and Chambord.   I have yet to visit this location into the wee hours, but they are open until 2am. As if that's not reason enough to give this place five stars!"}
{"text":"Hell Yeah.  Moist, crispy chicken.  Great fries, thick shakes.  This is the ultimate in late night comfort food"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken here and I've been here twice. My favorite is the thighs which you can order individually if you don't want the combo. They have a combo that includes hearts and gizzards as well as a plate of chicken lovers with onions. I plan on trying those next time."}
{"text":"When we went to Vegas. We couldn't help but eat here four times. They have the best chicken and fries as well as dozens of choices to choose from. We have zero complaints and the service here was literally Outstanding. They went above and beyond for not only us but everyone around us each time we went. I truly wish they would open one in Orlando because we would be there all the time. You will not regret going here."}
{"text":"This chicken is so good !!!! I got the 4 piece to share between 2 people and it was enough especially if you've been drinking. Then the next day got the 2 piece with and extra wing added. It was great! Come with fries and coleslaw which is very tart and not to good.  Bf got the chicken sandwich he said it was great too. They have a spicy honey sauce Over the chicken. Can't wait to come back to Vegas to visit here again. Staff is super friendly. There's a red head girl she was some helpful and nice !!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I had the Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich with fries and was blown away by the taste of it. The chicken was moist, well seasoned, excellent breading. The condiments on the sandwich added to the flavor. Love this place and will go again when I am back to Vegas."}
