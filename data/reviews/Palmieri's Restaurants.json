{"text":"We chose Palmieris based on the recent reviews and were oh, so disappointed.  We expected something great - at least something really Italian.  Not tonight.  Pasta was overcooked, marinara sauce was bland, ravioli special wasn't memorable.  It wasn't an awful place but it was nothing special.  Prices were expensive for the quality of food.  Waitress was fine and it looks like it  could be a nice place.  Just needs to step it up a notch."}
{"text":"These guys cook great food. Have been here for lunch, when working in the area and dinner with multiples of other couples. The dishes are beautifully prepared, with large portions and fairly priced. Have always had timely and pleasant service.  Cannot leave hungry. Excellent selection. Upstairs bar looks to be a fun place for sports telecasts or live bands. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Chicken Parmigiana is excellent and a good size portion. Staff is friendly and they generally run drink and food specials nightly. Overall great italian food spot!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very friendly, knowledgeable staff. Treated us like friends from the minute we walked in. Clean, roomy booths and tables. (I'm 6'4\") No doubt we will be back.  My only \"wish\" would be to have warm, fresh bread and soft butter.  ( the bread & butter was still good)"}
{"text":"Tasty food, fair prices. I had the Chicken Parmigiano, but with Ziti instead of Spaghetti (and I was pleased that there was no up-charge). The Ziti was a bit overcooked, almost mushy even, but the chicken was absolutely delicious, so I hardly cared that the pasta was overdone. The meal came with the choice of soup or a salad, so I chose Wedding soup. The soup was a bit leafier than I like, but it tasted good anyway. After dinner, I had a slice of cheesecake, which was adequate. I would like to come here again sometime if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. After waiting for aprox 20 min to be seated in an empty dining room we were seated. The waitress seemed pleasant enough but very disorganized. I ordered chicken parm and told her that I did not want the pasta that came with it. The girl said that she could give me soup in place of the pasta, I agreed. My wife ordered sole Romano . When the food came what my wife got was chicken Romano. My wife told the server and she said she would correct the mistake, but when the fish came she told my wife to scrape the rice off her chicken and put it on the fish. My chicken was correct but tasted like old tainted chicken. (Did not eat it all) When the check came I say a $4 charge for my cup of soup. I asked the server and she said \"that's the way it is\"  I understand now why the place was empty for lunch. Paid the check but we will never return."}
{"text":"Food is great! Zander's Bar is clean and friendly!! Bartender Darci is precious!!!! Band is less than mediocre!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy chicken sandwich and french fries. I loved the bourbon onions! The bruscetta looked different than I have seen elsewhere but it was excellent. I could have ordered that as a meal. The cheese sticks are gigantic but you only get 3 which is an odd number. Overall food was great but it was slightly pricey. The atmosphere was a little dim and our server was okay. I had plenty of food left to take with me. I'd would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to go, but they only have one person running the whole bar and tables that are trying to eat in this restaurant's bar!  For that they get a 3.  Unbelievable you have to go to the bar wait like you are waiting for a drink, and order your food and get some silverware tossed at you.  As we waited at a table she never came over to check on us and when our food came our she briskly threw it down and ran off.  Not a word is everything ok, can I get you anything?  I had to go to the bar, wait again, because she didn't bring any salt or pepper, and she certainly didn't apologize.  I have been there when it wasn't so busy and had a better time, but come on!  How do you expect a tip when you have to track down the waitress/bartender/dishwasher/foodrunner!!! Kind of pathetic on the management side.  I mean one person!!!  There are probably 10 table plus a bar to look after!   I don't blame her as much as you could tell she was frazzled but there is a point of common courtesy and I would think that should have occured to her.  Otherwise food is good, prices aren't bad, and they have specials a lot.  Just don't eat in the bar if you expect to be serviced."}
{"text":"Went with my friends and here two parents. A typical Italian food craving scenario. We arrived at a time when we one of singular persons in the restaurant [saturday before dinner rush] so the food was quickly served.  We started with simple drinks, a few pops and a few beers. The selection is your house selections for the pittsburgh area.   The waitress was quick and personable and we enjoyed a few sample appetizers [cheese zucchini]. The portions were on the larger side and all scrumptious."}
{"text":"Really a nice place. Food is good, staff is attentive and the pricing is very fair. Chicken Parmesan was fantastic."}
{"text":"My family used the banquet facilities on the lower level for my son's rehearsal dinner. We had about 70 guests, I was a nervous wreck but John put me at ease every time I talked to him. John and his amazing staff could not have been more friendly, attentive and professional. John suggested we use a bartender, since I wanted the drinking to a minimum and he was right. The food was delicious and plenty full, we could bring our own cake and decorations. We also had our own entrance which was so convenient for wheelchairs, walkers and canes. Everyone who attended was so impressed and want to return for dinner, thanks to John and his amazing staff!!"}
{"text":"Driving up, I had no idea what to expect from a place that looked like it was part of an industrial park.  Walking in, I was further confused as to what I was about to experience.  On the left, there is a large bar/night club which was emitting a cloud of smoke.  Directly in front of us was a bar straight out of the 1960s(ish) and to the left was the dining area.  It wanted to be five star in look and feel and sort of made you feel awkward because unless you were expecting it, from the exterior it seems to be more casual.  Overall, I was impressed with this place.  The menu selection is huge.  Everything from sandwiches and salads to pasta dinners and even steak and seafood.  Prices and portions were very reasonable and you get a lot for what you pay for.  While you are browsing the menu, the server brings you a small plate with olives and a few veggies along with your bread.  Its nice to have something small to tide you over if you are super hungry.  Most entrees come with two sides.  There are soups, salads and traditional sides that go with your meal.  I chose a salad and a side of spaghetti to go with my chicken fra diavolo.  My husband had the chicken parm and chose spaghetti and stuffed pepper soup as his sides.  The chicken parm was HUGE and extremely tasty.  When we come back for another visit, it is likely what I will order.  The fra diavolo was wonderful as well.  The chicken was tender and flavorful and there was a real kick to it.  It isn't usually served over pasta, but when I asked the waiter about the dish he thought it was, so since he had misinformed me, they put it over pasta at no extra charge.  Desserts looked tasty, but we were so full that we both had doggie bags to go.   One down side is that we were seated at the walk way area.  Apparently to get to the banquet room, guests needed to walk through the restaurant, so when a party was gathering, we had many people walk past.  It was a bit distracting.   Overall, a good experience with tasty food.  We will be back, especially since it is so close to home."}
{"text":"Palmieri's makes their own meatballs and sauce, breads their own fish and chicken, and doesn't take shortcuts. Specials are always good and service is friendly. Wish the dining room was a little more full!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We started with fried cheese - freshly made. I  had a special, shrimp pizziaolli, nice sized shrimp in garlic butter with tomatoes and bread crumbs. My husband had another special veal braciole, rolled veal with stuffing. Old school italian restaurant."}
