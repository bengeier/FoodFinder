{"text":"I had one bite of my $5 General Tao chicken and realized that it was deep-fried chicken gristle.  Not that I was expecting big chunks of boneless, skinless white meat, but that was kinda gross.    But the worst was my gf ordered another $5 entree - some pork thing that tasted like the meat had gone bad.  She tried to send it back after one bite, but the owner/chef came back (I think it was the mother of our server) with the plate of disgusting food to tell her that the food was \"fresh and good\".  She refused to take it back and wouldn't offer any refund or even maybe something else on the menu (not that we wanted to try anything else). If my gf didn't want to eat it, she could put it in a box to take home, but that was the only \"option\" we were offered.  Bottom line: it's CHEAP and you don't really even get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Made in China doesn't pretend to be what it isn't.  It is cheap, fast, simple Chinese-based food.  If you walk into this place expecting authenticity, then I'd say you have no experience with authentic Chinese places, because no authentic Chinese place aimed specifically at Chinese people would decorate like this.  Most of what I've tried in this place is actually quite decent.  The menu contains a vast variety of dishes, and many of these are very competitively priced.  This is one of those places where you can get a meal for $5 to $8 including taxes, and the portions and variety are both substantial enough that you'll feel like you're getting more food than if you spent the same amount at McDonald's or Tim Horton's.  The General Tsao's Chicken is extra spicy, but you actually get quite a bit of chicken for the price, and the dish is attractively arranged, which is unusual for cheap Chinese food.  I quite like the Double-Cooked pork as well.  Seating is not the greatest, with all the seats on the side having these inexplicable \"trenches\" right behind the seat so that you can fall backwards into them.  The tables also feel cramped.  It's probably part of the intended design; the murals out front, the lighting and the entire decor suggest that they're trying to evoke a communal kitchen, . The fact that it's probably intentional doesn't make the decor any easier on the eyes or any more comfortable on the buttocks.  I've gone to Mao's Kitchen in Los Angeles, which has the same aesthetic but much more comfortable seating, lighting, and overall appeal.  One of the big minuses at Made in China is the bathroom.  Not only is it one of those downtown Toronto basement deals which make you feel like you're walking into a meat locker, but this bathroom is so dark and cramped that it feels extra seedy.  Cleanliness is somewhat above average, but this bathroom setup has an unforgivable flaw:  Men and women have separate stalls, but have to share the same hand-washing area.  It's a major privacy flaw.  Made in China is a pretty decent spot for its location.  If you want cheap Chinese food and don't mind travelling a bit, I'd suggest going to Chinatown on Spadina Ave., where you can get the same approach -- lots of food, $5 to $8 -- at Goldstone or Canteen.  However, if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive meal around Dundas Square, you can do a lot worse than Made in China."}
{"text":"Hot Pot was average. Started off by choosing soup base (some are free while others cost extra). I got half satay (nice flavour) and tom yum (not spicy at all but sour). Filled out their little sheet of paper with the cooking ingredients and it came out promptly. Each order was given in small portions which is good and bad at the same time as it limits you from ordering too much when your eyes are bigger than your tummy but also bad because if you wanted more, you'd have to order again with a new sheet of paper. They don't allow you to write down how many servings you want but you're enforced to circle what you want and each order comes out as ONE serving - very tedious. The list of things you can order is typically limited with beef, lamb, chicken, pork, various balls, veggies and noodles - if menu is limited, I would have expected the quality to be higher.  Food was so-so and price was unusually more expensive than other places for lunch at $17 per person. I've tried a few hot pot places around and there are definitely others that give you a bang for your buck with superior quality."}
{"text":"OK Hot pot option for the downtown core  My hubby and I have walked past Made in China hundreds of times...but only through a search on Yelp for hot pot did we discover their AYCE Hot Pot! Decent list of different broths to choose from: he went for the satay, I went for the clear broth with thousand year old egg and cilantro. Fairly extensive list of food items to choose from, ranging from vegetables, meat, dumplings, noodles. For some reason, they gave us a sample of their seafood platter - perhaps they wanted people to sample it, otherwise it's an up charge of $3 a person (I don't think it's worth it, but I'm glad we were able to try it). I think they offered some appetizers as well, but we just stuck to the hot pot as my hubby isn't into things like curried fish balls. They provide you with a number of sauces which was great.  Overall, it was OK. Not fab, but did the trick to solve our hot pot craving. As with other reviews, the meats are a little fatty. The clear broth was bland; the satay broth was quite salty. But I'd say for a convenient location, it isn't a bad hot pot option."}
{"text":"My friend and I paid 30 dollars for a miserable bowl of rice and a small portion of beef. If you're hungry go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Passable chinese dishes, but the hot and sour soup was really great. I can see how students would love this place for its budget meals and casual atmosphere. I wouldn't rush back or anything but it was pretty okay."}
{"text":"We visited Toronto on family vacation.  On the day we arrived (tired from a day at Niagara), we got to the condo we rented, unpacked, and crashed for a while.  So we finally decided to explore Yonge St and looked for something to eat.  There were a lot of hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and we couldn't agree where to go, but finally decided upon Made In China.  It was a little weird, going into this huge dining room, nearly empty - we weren't sure what we were getting into.  The menu was expansive, but we ended up ordering of the specials list, except my oldest son, who ordered off the Made in Korea menu (from next door).  All of us were pleased with the meal and it was very affordable.  We liked the unlimited tea that came with the meals. It wasn't the best Chinese food I have had, but it may have been the best I have had for the price.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  He was from China, and had only been in North America for a couple of years, and we had a good time talking with him.   A little sad, however, we were asking about tourist areas, and he was unfamiliar with most everything, almost as if he had never left the premises, which made me wonder about the pay / working conditions / freedom of the immigrant employees (perhaps I've watched too many Law and Order type shows).  All in all -- Good food, low prices, enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Cannot be beat.  Best General Tao in town and more than happy to do special requests.  Excellent prices and awesome staff too."}
{"text":"I have only been here for the AYCE Hot Pot. For about $20, you get unlimited hot pot and soda. You can choose two broths from a decent list, some broth bases require extra payment, I have only tried their basic broths. The one with the duck egg and cilantro is a bit bland and the satay broth base is too salty and has a weird taste I can't pin point.   However the broth being bland/weird doesn't bother me a lot since they provide a lot of condiments to make your own dipping sauce, hot pot to me is all about the ingredients and dipping sauce anyways. What bothers me is stale food.  I love watercress, especially in hot pot. 3 times I were there everything went smoothly but 2 other times the watercress had a lot of yellowing, which means that it is pretty stale and is rotting.   If they were consistent with the freshness of ingredients I would patronize them more often due to the convenient location, but it is a crap shoot, so I would only go if I desperately wanted hot pot and is too lazy to go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I have had regular main dishes and hot pot here with friends. I don't like their food, toooo sweet...i don't think you can call this Chinese food....but the location of this restaurant is good...i wish a really good authentic Chinese Restaurant will open nearby in future."}
{"text":"This place offers a-okay Chinese/Korean food for an a-okay price. I ordered the Korean chicken bento lunch ($5.99) and it was surprisingly fairly tasty. I really liked that they gave a variety of vegetables as sides. This included sour daikon, bean sprouts, and kimchi. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the overall bento was filling."}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour pork, it looked appealing, but the taste did not follow through. It tasted like cubes of fat and sweet and sour sauce. I ended up just eating part of the rice and sauce."}
{"text":"This place has one of the largest selection of menu items I've ever seen in a restaurant. They don't give you one menu. They gave us like 5-6. One for drinks, one for weekly specials, one is the \"normal\" menu, one for sizzling stuff, one for fusion stuff and maybe one more I don't recall. We were amazed they don't just have Chinese food. They also have Ramen, KBBQ, Hot Pot, Breakfast, Pasta, Baked Casserole and even Thai Curry. Impressive selection.  With so many choices, it took forever for us to decide. This is not a bad thing. I enjoy reading menus and fantasizing about eating each item. I eventually settled on the Taiwanese Red Braised Beef Noodles which is a weekly special item at $7.99 and my partner got Thai Chicken Fried Rice, which is another special item. Both come with fountain drink which really means watered down soft drink served in a cup.   As we waited excitedly for our food, we noticed how big this place is. From the outside it looks tiny but it's actually huge. The decor is pretty good. Usually I don't associate Chinese places with good decor but this place is nice.   Of course, the food is what matters. While the menu selection is impressive, the food is less so. The portion for the fried rice was just \"ok\". The fried rice didn't have a lot of chicken and the rice was a little hard. We've had better fried rice. The Taiwanese beef noodle was not \"red\" and it was more salty than I expected but it was edible. The spiciness was a little mild for my taste but passable.  Would I come again? Probably. I've sworn off Korean Grill house so I'm not getting their KBBQ. At these really reasonable prices, it wouldn't hurt to give them another shot. But I'm definitely not expecting amazing food from this place."}
{"text":"Had Hotpot buffet. Food is great!!!! Each customer can get a half lobster, 1 scallop, 1 mussel, 1 piece of salmon, a couple of shrimp and some fish balls for free if you order dinner. Please be aware that it's not really a good deal for small eater. Each of us spend about 30 bucks."}
{"text":"Cool mod interior, giant propagandist mural staring down at you, young efficient if not overly attentive staff - the $5.99 special can NOT be beat.  Admittedly, I was a bit worried about what would turn up on my place for $5.99 which includes a free soft drink -- how surprised was I to find a full portion of delicious food.  I had the winter melon and spare ribs and it was yummy.   I also had the optional bowl of hot n sour soup for $1 more.  This soup arrived n a bowl that would not have been out of place at one of T.dot's finest eateries AND the soup was filled with lots of bits of the requisite bamboo shoot, mushrooms.  amazing for $1!  Made in China has earned itself a spot on my short list of best food bargains in the T.dot.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We visited Made in China on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. We were initially drawn in by the huge Mao era mural while walking down Yonge St, and found that the theme continued inside with similar graphics along the walls and behind the bar. The restaurant shares its large, slightly steamy, primary seating area with Korean Grill House so most tables were equipped with a stove.  Hot Pot seemed to be the meal of choice here as most of the lively groups were having it. Overall the setup was spacious, tables and chairs clean, and the decor refreshingly unique.  Their menu, as with most Chinese restaurants, was extensive and included some really inexpensive specials ($5.99 to $8.99). We ended up deciding on the Short Rib Sizzling Plate and Singapore Style Vermicelli.  Both dishes came out pretty quickly with the Vermicelli arriving in a miniature wok which we thought was a nice touch. The portions were more than enough, but the meals themselves were pretty average.   What prompted me to give this restaurant 4 stars was the service.  Our server was very attentive, genial and most impressively patient.  We overheard her explaining the menu to a group of other non-Asians and were impressed at the way she answered their many questions.  With us, she was very attentive but not intrusive.  Bottom line - she made my dining experience better, which nowadays is becoming more of an exception than the rule.  With a low price point, decent food, cool decor, and great service, Made in China is a good choice for HK style Chinese food along the Yonge strip."}
{"text":"I must be the only person to complete the Made-in-China tour as I've been to the Scarborough hot-spot as well. The design colors and patterns of the space is similar but I feel much more open as there are less barriers and overhead vents in the way. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/made-in-china-hot-pot-toronto   We were asked if we came for Hot Pot, Hell ya! 3 guys walking in looking to scarf down a Cow, which was our intent. This means my ranking is for Hot Pot and not their a la cart Menu.   A la cart seems to be unpopular and solely meant for people that want Chinese but do not understand or otherwise dislike soupy communal Hot Pot. I notice most a la cart patrons are coming in alone so Hot Pot might be less suitable for individuals.   Weeknight Adult($17.95) is same price structure and the selection list is the exact same. The service does make attempts to satisfy and A-OK in general. General MAO Zedong looks over us, classic patriotic I didn't find in the Scarborough branch.   On a Weeknight there was maybe 20% full at any one time and mostly Chinese patrons. This is the season for Hot Pot and the suburb spots of same nature are usually guaranteed to be filled much more than this."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quality food place for cheap then look no further.Specially for students like myself, it is a great place to eat. I am going through their $5.99 lunch deals, and so far all of them tasted great. The lunch deal also includes soft drink (no refill). They sell some Chinese pottery and other merchandise within the restaurant, in case you are interested. The restaurant has a nice interior as well."}
{"text":"Came here with Husband and a huge group of friends a few months back. Hot pot was not all that great, and the soup choices were limited. It was nice that they had split dividers so that if you had one half spicy and the other half not, you'd be able to choose.  The quality of meats were okay, but a bit too fatty for my liking. Most of their other offerings were processed fish and meat balls with imitation crab. Pretty standard hot pot choices, and even still, on the lower grade of quality.  For a price of close to $25-30 CAD/head for AYCE, I expected a little more. Understandable that since it's in Downtown core near Eaton Centre and price will be naturally higher, but wish they'd either reduce the number of item choices and bump up the quality, or go all out and offer a lot more overall.  It's a fun place to go with friends and socialize, but if you're there for the food only, I'd definitely pass."}
{"text":"Aside from the ironic name, their lunch specials are pretty tasty and priced reasonably . They offer a selection of typical Chinese/Japanese/Korean dishes such as fried noodles, ramen, and even pork bone soup.  We regularly visit the place for lunch since its near work. The prices are OK even though the portions are slightly below average. It's a nice place to check out but nothing really outstanding. Will definitely come back to try out their hot pot."}
{"text":"I love their hot pot very much.  We got half lobster, one giant oyster, shrimp, salmon each for our seafood dish.  We love their Japanese fish balls, lamb balls and also dumplings.  Their chicken and crispy beef are fantastic, esp beef, super tender and juicy. Their seafood menu options are very limited, hope they can add something more into their menu in the future."}
{"text":"The $5.99 daily lunch specials, including soda (no refills!) are incredibly cheap and they don't cut back on portions, either.  I've only eaten lunch here, but the General Tso's chicken was great.  My friend had the Thai green curry beef with rice, and I had a little of that, and it was great, too.  Odd to see the flag of the PRC & a big picture of Mao staring down at you in front, and at first it looked like a \"let's-create-a-Chinesey-looking-place-for-non-Asians,\" but most of the customers inside were Asian (look, I'm white myself, but if I see a Chinese restaurant with mostly white people, I'll stay away...)  The staff are very young, friendly, and enthusiastic & also work at the Korean restaurant attached (which shares the same kitchen.)  Would absolutely go there again next time I'm in Toronto.  (The Yelp map also looks a little off...it's in between Dundas & College on Yonge, not north of Bloor...)"}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Actually surprised this palce is still open!  With Made in China, I gave this restaurant two chances and that was enough for me.  First time I went was with a group of friends, on a recommendation from someone who says it's their favourite place to go. I had wonton soup and fried rice, which after coming home I immediately got sick from. The second time I ate here was with a different friend and I had their special \"fried noodles with beef\" that a waiter personally recommended as their favourite dish. Luckily I didn't get sick eating this but the meal wasn't even cooked! Noodles were hard and it was luke warm.  Finally, my friend who ate with me on my second attempt actually went back again because they didnt get sick and thought I was just being dramatic... only to get sick after eating there again!  Therefore, people eat there at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I sometimes eat here from time to time during my Ryerson years, and it is indeed a very decent and cheap eat-in lunch spot. The Maoist propaganda theme cracks me up (and I believe, if not mistaken, some of the merch on display are available on sale).  The food however, cracks me up even more. It may say 'Made in China' on the door, but they serve Chinese fusion meals. Oh, not just that, they make some Japanese, Thai and Malay dishes, and much of their ironic menu is essentially what would you get when a gwai lo imagines what combining Chinese and Thai food together would be like. Since Made in China shares restaurant space and operations with the adjacent Korean Grill House, you could also order from the Korean menu. Sounds a whole lot like a Maoist culinary takeover.  And oh, they also do hot pot, but never got around to try that.  The stuff is very filling and well-presented, but as unspectacular as a typical Chinatown Chinese dim-sum. I once ordered a pad thai (to prove myself the point of ordering Thai at a place that calls itself Chinese), and it was a sad slop of noodles.  It's a very kitschy, Chinese-for-hip-White-folks kind of place. But it's also a damn cheap restaurant, and for the prices, it's very good enough. Especially if you are a debt-incurring Ryerson student tired of campus cafeteria crap, fast food and hot dogs.  {TTC: from Dundas station, walk north past Gould.}"}
{"text":"I spent most of my Uni years going here. $7 dinners... includes a drink and green tea. Variety of choices and awesome setting open late at night. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Go to a hot pot hot pot place for hot pot. Their service is not as good as a real hot pot place for hot pot. The food was good but little sheep or celebrity were better overall. Had the obligatory 10 plates of lamb and watercress. Tip is included in bill already also."}
{"text":"The food here is standard hot pot fare but the fact that its AYCE makes it so much better. The price is standard as well. Some things are a little sloppy but its AYCE"}
{"text":"A great little Chinese place for cheap and reasonable price food ad a huge amount of food for a great price.. Staff is friendly here and it's a nice quiet place to dine as well.."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Made in China is not the place you go to if you're expecting high end hot pot, but for the price you pay here it's of excellent value.  I came here for hot pot on a cold day with my family, and was welcomed immediately by employees who look like university students (Ryerson is adjacent to this restaurant and U of T is also not very far). Despite their relative lack of experience, the students really do try to provide good service, and I do give them credit for it.  AYCE hot pot here amounted to about $20, but depending on the soup base you order it may cost a little more. Regardless, the price for hot pot here is less than other hot pot places in the city, and it should be taken into consideration when ordering your protein and veggies. Their meat selection is not too wide, but their meat quality is actually very good for the price you pay. There's also a decent seafood selection consisting of squid and octopus, and they tasted decent too. I believe you also get a free seafood platter on weekends that consist of lobsters, mussels, etc.  Service, as I mentioned, was excellent and remained great the whole way.  Overall if you're expecting high quality hot pot, this isn't your place. However if you're expecting high value food at affordable prices, this is definitely a place to consider if hot pot is something you like."}
{"text":"Unlike most of the reviews on here, I didn't have any of the Chinese cooked food and came exclusively for the hot pot.... which is delicious! I'm so happy I found a place downtown that does hot pot well - I always had to go up to Scarborough or Markham before to enjoy hot pot.  Their hot pot is very reasonably priced at $17.95 + $2 for the broth. They also have a variety of premium broths ranging from $5 to $6 more per pot. It's all you can eat, and they have a wide selection of meats and vegetables. I especially enjoyed their wontons. They also had a lot of sauces to pick from to mix your own, which is key to hot pot. I came with 2 co-workers from China and they enjoyed the hot pot, as well as my other co-workers that were new to the concept of hot pot. Lastly, the dinner came with all you can eat dessert, and everyone enjoyed the mango pudding and tapioca.  So if you're looking for a good place to have hot pot, this is the place to go. It's quite clean and comfortable, the service is decent and it's well-priced, comparable to other hot pot places in Markham / Scarborough."}
{"text":"Great cheap eats in the downtown core. I've been here many times. Their specials are very affordable, starting at $5.99.  Their ramen menu is great too."}
{"text":"This place is actually located on Yonge just north of Dundas, it's showing up on the map on Rosedale which is incorrect.  Anyway, this is one of those places where you know it's just going to be mediocre. \"Asian Fusion\" is right. Even though the place is called Made in China, half of the dishes are badly done thai food.  I was about to give this place 3 stars because the decor is quite cool, the service was great and the price point is incredible. But the food, oh the food, was just really, really 2 star.  They do have really cheap specials. Lots of options for $5.99, with the option to add a bowl of soup, tiny spring roll and 1 bbq rib for $2.50. And FREE pop! You can get this at any time of day, not just lunch. So makes for a cheap dinner.  Food was presented nicely but just very bland. I had kung pow chicken which I thoroughly doused in hot sauce to add some kind of flavour."}
{"text":"This place has Chinese fusion food and the other side is a Korean grill. They have hot pot, Hong Kong comfort food, Shanghainese food, and Northern Chinese food. I went in for the Hong Kong Chinese food. I had the shrimp with egg over fried ho fun. Ohmigod. It was glutton goodness served up in a mini wok. Those of you who aren't into saucy egg dishes, this might not be the dish for you. This was a typical HK dish, which is usually served over rice, but this place had it over fried ho fun which I've never had before or even seen available in the States. The noodles were nice and tender and the egg sauce added such good overall flavoring to it. When you go to the bottom, the ho fun noodles were fried crispy so there was a nice crunch to it at the end.   I also had fried dumplings which was nothing to rave about. The shell was more like a cheap pastry flake shell, and it tasted kind dry and bland. The sauce that came with it didn't make them any better either.  I wish I had more days to try other HK dishes here. I'm hoping next time I stop in Toronto, I can come back and have my favorite childhood dish - the fried spaghetti with ham. Yum!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: An insanely cheap Hong Kong style diner + hot pot wrapped in a communist-chic decor.  Made in China is basically your typical Hong Kong diner for any meal of the day. You want macaroni with spam in soup? Russian borsch? Spaghetti bolognese in cheese? Baked chicken in Portugal sauce on rice or spaghetti? Done, done, done and done! There are combo menus for everything that will add an appy, soup and drink for cheap.   Their lunch combos are unbeatable for $5.99. For dinner, they have a great \"tasting menu\" for $10, where they bring you a 3-course meal with an appy, soup and main dish. Often times, the dishes are small variations of their usual dishes, or are presented in a platter of 3 to 4 smaller selections.   I have yet to try their AYCE hot pot for about $20, but judging by what other Yelpers say, it sounds solid. Service is also typical of most Chinese restaurants so you know what you're getting into. At the end of the day, while nothing will blow you away, Made In China offers solid and decent food for cheap."}
{"text":"First.. It's not Chinese food ... It's Chinese fusion food. I'm from Hong Kong and I don't like the food here. If you from china.. Please stay away!!  Ps - the 2 stars are for the $ and atmosphere plus there ain't any service"}
{"text":"The food is a bit hit and miss. I think the hits make up for the misses though. And who doesn't love the communist era decorations. Tourists must love this place.  Singapore vermicelli was okay. Vermicelli with pickled vegetables and.. duck (I think) was very good."}
{"text":"OK. THE most important thing for hot pot is the sauce. It doesn't matter u have highend lamb meat or shrimp. When dining there, all I wanted was to go to the kitchen and showed them how to mix decent sauce. I was almost desperate enough to to ask them bring the raw material so I can do it myself...The dipping was so salty and tasted strange..."}
{"text":"I LOVE  this place. Me and my boyfriend come here every week and we sit in the same spot and we order the same two dishes. We get the spicy chili fish and the beijing style sizzling beef plate. We love the food, the staff, and the general atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"With a restaurant name like, Made in China what can one expect from such a place? My guess would be cheap prices, Canadian Chinese food and a place whose decor will be a mixture of loud and contemporary. If you guessed all this as well, then you will know exactly what to expect from this restaurant.  Made in China is conveniently located along Yonge close to Gerrard. It has a large space amongst many other food options and the decor is kinda interesting. You will see murals of random Chinese icons and symbols. There will be a plethora of Chinese cartoony drawings with a panda or rooster smack right in the middle of all the action.  But don't be fooled, this is no run down restaurant. Most of the furniture and decor in fact look well maintained and still give off that new feel.  Made in china has a very competitive daily specials from $5.99 to about $7.99. And the food portions aren't bad at all.  With each dinner special comes a free pop beverage.  I've been to Made in China a number of times and decided to drop by after work with Angela.  There was a ton of seating around 6pm so we were seated quickly. The place can even seem a little quiet at times, so reservations usually aren't required.  We ordered off the daily special menu and each item was only $5.99. I got the General Tao Chicken and Angela got the Oyster Sauce Spare Ribs & Mixed Vegs. The wait wasn't bad at around 10 minutes or so and we were given tea during the wait.  Once the food arrived, we did noticed the portion sizes have dropped a little since the last time we dropped by. A little less in all aspects except for rice. A little less vegs, a little less meat and even a little less sauce it seems. But still I consider Made in China a good deal to in downtown Toronto. The General Tao was cooked well with the typical taste and sauce. The spare rib on the other hand was a disappointment. The flavour was alright but the choice of ribs used appeared to be weak. It was tough and a little chewy. I believe if they cooked it a little longer, the meat would have tasted much better and have a better \"fall of the bone\" effect.  Lower grade ribs used?   Overall, I still like Made in China.  The service is the usual standard attentive \"Chinese\" style dinner service.  They use to have many more options for the $5.99 daily specials but I'm sure pricing across the board has gone up. So this may really be a reflection of the cost of doing business.  Wish they had more options like in the past but at this price and at this location downtown, I can't really complain too much."}
{"text":"Portion size for only being $6 was fair. Restaurant was clear, friendly staff. Drinks could be a little larger... they were basically large shot glasses."}
