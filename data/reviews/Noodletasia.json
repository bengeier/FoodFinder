{"text":"Love this place! From the hot and sour soup to the sushi this place is awesome. The prices are great and so is the service!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, portions are very large and a great value. Sushi menu has plenty of choices. Take out is always great, thanks for always remembering our order Tommy"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I had a really fun evening.  Our waitress was super cute.  I asked her what she recommended and she sat down and explained the menu cover to cover and gave me her favorites out of each section.  They have noodle bowls and traditional Chinese meals like General Tso's, they have noodle soups and rice dishes.  The menu is quite extensive.  The prices are reasonable and the food is GOOD.  It's a comfy friendly atmosphere.  Mmm mmm dig in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here at least 1x per week up until about 9 months ago. I was surprised at how much the food quality has suffered in that time. Everything fried, tasted VERY oily, as if the oil hasn't been cleaned in quite some time.  I went to order sushi and they were out of soy paper, which is crazy. The sweet and sour chicken I ordered instead, was 80% batter and very greasy.  It's also worth noting their sanitation rating has dropped down to 90%, a massive drop since my last visit.   The service was good, however. Our waitress was friendly and came by frequently.  Bottom line, this place will be out if business soon, sadly, unless they make major changes to the food quality.   The manager needs to be fired for letting it get to this point and not addressing all the negative reviews.   It's an easy fix, guys; replace the chef's asap and listen to your customers!  Sad - this used to be my favorite sushi place. Now, I can't imagine coming back."}
{"text":"What happened? We used to love this place. The same items we used to get now taste horrible. And the price seems to be way more. Should have kept the old owner on as a consultant. Will have to drive to coral or Osaka now."}
{"text":"It looks to me like a chain.  The decor is too modern and purposeful.  Apparently it is not a chain.  It has been at least ten years since I laughed at the neighborhood Chinese restaurant adding Japanese food to its offerings.  \"Fusion\" apparently came and flourished without my knowing it.  This is the popular food about which I know the least.  I will say this: the food tastes good.  The ingredients appear to be fresh and of good quality, the prices seem to be very reasonable, and the service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We were huge NoodleTasia fans when Tommy was here.   It obviously took a huge dive when he sold out to the new owners.   The good news is that there are now NEW owners and NoodleTasia is back!!   The sauces are a bit different (not in a bad way) from what everyone was used to but they are really good.   We've been here twice this week, just to confirm our visit and it was great both times.   For everyone that was loyal to Tommy, come back and give it another chance.   Much improved from where it was."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. The service was very attentive, and made sure everything was as ordered. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is my local go-to Chinese restaurant. I usually get it as take-out. Like most Chinese restaurants, they either have over the top 'welcome-to-Asia' decor or this bland no atmosphere kind of place. Noodletasia does fall into the latter category, but don't let that stop you from coming in.   My staples are the sesame chicken or lemon chicken. He usually gets the Mongolian beef as his regular dish. The food consistency and quality is good, the portions are large, and the prices are fair. Tommy the owner is usually at the take out side of the restaurant. He is friendly, fast moving, and knows his regular customers. This place will be in business for a long time."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. We had the Szechwan noodles, the Dandan noodles and the Mongolian beef. The Szechwan noodles tasted kinda like pho but were lacking something. I am a little uncomfortable with the way they mix Asian cultures in this restaurant - on the other hand it's like being able to have all your favorites in one place."}
{"text":"Jumping through Cornelius on a sushi binge, we happened across Noodletasia. Nice and friendly staff, good atmosphere. Fresh fish and yummy rolls. We were hung on how to rate this. 4 stars seemed a little high but 3 stars was just too low. I would say 3.5 stars but we would rather put 4 and tell you 3.5 than actually just give it 3. This place deserves more than 3 stars because its better than just a-ok. Great place, you should give it a try.... Edit: Upon further talk, we decided that they deserve the solid 4 stars. They have a \"suprise me\" catagory on the sushi menue. Tell the chef your likes and dislikes and he will suprise you with a roll. We were suprised and it was very good !!!"}
{"text":"Worst food and experience we have had in the Huntersville area. We had bugs in our food and they didn't even care. The first time we went the food was ok but this time the crab ragoons were sour and the pad Thai was bitter. The rest of the stuff we ordered seemed like it was old and unfresh. I'm not sure if Ramon is new or what but he needs to get it together. We got our food and had to wait another 5 minutes before we even got forks or chopsticks to eat it with. Half way through the meal we ran out of water and never got a refill. We were one table out of 3 that had people in it. They were not busy at all. Last time we ever go there."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from here. Nothing really stands out about their food. The decor is lovely. Very modern."}
{"text":"Noodletasia used to be wonderful! Unfortunately, this place seems to be under new management and Tommy is gone. The hostess and wait staff are awkward and inexperienced. There were several dirty tables that were never cleaned while I ate dinner there. My favorite dish is now ruined, and tastes like over processed store bought food. I do not plan to come back unless I am desperate for mediocre Asian food. R.I.P. Noodletasia."}
{"text":"Cute interior. First impression was that the dining area was cute. Great for groups. Me and my two boys got out of here for $50.  I almost choked on my green tea because when I was ordering, I figured mine to be $20 bucks.  $8 for my veggie roll, $6 for a salad, and I ordered of the $1 menus some individual pieces of sushi to make $20.  So you can imagine my surprise when the bill came to $50, but I forgot that my 2 kids were with me.  The restaurant didn't have a kids' menu, but my kids aren't the kids menu type anyway.  My older son, well, he'd just look at a kids menu and take one of each on a normal day, if you know what I mean! Speaking of him, he ordered the Pho. Guess he was craving it since he hadn't had any since July.  He said it was good, and I believe him because he was slurping that soup like it was going out of style.  My little 4 year old got an order of the lo mein and loved it! Noodles are one of his favorite foods and he was eating this like crazy too.  Made me start to wonder if I fed them any lunch that day.  They were eating like they were starving.  I ordered a seaweed salad, because I always do if it's on the menu.  Love the stuff. Don't know why.  This was supposed to come with squid, but the waitress said they had ran out, so I agreed to just have it plain.  They didn't take any $$ off for the missing squid, but I never mentioned it.  They were nice all evening and the service really was great.  I ate all my sashimi/ngiri plate, and tried one of the veggie rolls. I had planned to take the veggie rolls home anyway.  I was quite full. The boys ordered some tempura Oreo's and thought they were delicious! And I quite enjoyed the fortune cookies I got with the bill.  The first place I've been to where the fortune cookie was brown. Heck yeah, CHOCOLATE flavored fortune cookies. I inhaled those. (Hell, the kids had oreos, they didn't need the extra cookies).   I had been craving sushi for a long, long, time, and I'm glad I made the time today to take the boys out to a place like this! All 3 of us agreed that we would come back here.  $1.75 drinks x 3 $7.50 Chicken Lo Mein $7.95 Pho $8.00 Veggie Roll (8 pieces) $6.00 Seaweed Salad $5.00 Oreo Tempura w/ vanilla Ice cream $1/ea. assorted sushi/sashimi/ngiri"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible. I ordered three DIFFERENT dishes and they were all bland. I am so beyond disappointed, if I hadn't just driven 20 minutes there, I'd go back with the food and complain. Save yourself 8 dollars, go buy some Ramen..."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon and we are visiting. from Greensboro. Fried rice, fried noodle, and chicken w broccoli. Great food and service."}
{"text":"This place was close to the customer site where I was working.  I had the Szechuan noodle bowl with beef.  This is a noodle soup dish with flat noodles, beef, bean sprouts,  and a very mildly spiced soup.  The pieces of beef were good, not fatty or tough.  I would have liked a bit more of a chili kick.  I am willing to go back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The only take out place I have saved in my phone! Great food! You can get traditional Chinese or healthy rice bowls. The owner is often there and the service cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Mu husband and I have tried this restaurant two Sat. afternoons in the last 5-6 weeks.  Both times the service was unprofessional, rude, uninformed, poorly trained, too busy chatting with each other to check on our table, and hanging out buy the kitchen doors drinking Starbucks beverages.  There were very few customers in the restaurant both times we ate there..  The food was just okay.  Shrimp dishes leave a weird taste in your mouth.  Egg rolls are practically empty.  Warning:  If you don't place your lunch special entre order by 3:00 P.M. SHARP, you will be charged the dinner price.  Overall food quality is the same as a mall food court Asian place."}
{"text":"Good quality food, very tasty, & really large portions (at least the noodle bowl was)."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Try the crunchy crunchy sushi roll.   The chicken wings are great especially take out and use your own sauce.  My kids always split a noodle bowl and usually get two meals a piece from it.  Definitely reccommend."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in the area. The vegetable roll is simply amazing.  The vegan rice bowl was also great - especially with the sauce they give you as a side. I just dumped it right in and mixed it up.  I also had the Popeye Noodle bowl (on my second visit) and did not regret it. Tasty and warm - and very filling.   The take-out waiting area (a separate door) could use a few more seats and the bathroom could use some sprucing up - but overall - this place is fantastic and I wish we had something like it in my hometown."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here one night and I ordered the Szechuan noodle bowl with shrimp and my husband ordered the Hunan Chicken. Mine was pretty good and I really liked the wide noodles. I could tell that the shrimp wasn't fresh though. It just had a strange flavor to it so I picked around them. My husband's chicken was just okay. The food was average but the service was very good. On the plus side, Noodletasia is definitely healthier than your average Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in a grim and sterile suburban \"business center\" strip shopping center, this was doubtful from the beginning.  Two of us ordered dishes, and both grimaced when we started eating.  Everything seemed like it had been cooked 2 days earlier.  The place had a scuzzy un-cared for feel, and the service staff treated us like stray cats.  Ate half, and left quickly, wondering about the woeful tastes that can keep a place like this open."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I needed to provide a word of caution.   Noodletasia used to be one of the best Asian restaurants, not just in Charlotte. Not any longer. The food has declined in quality significantly. Believe ownership has changed, but the menu stayed the same. Do not be fooled, this is not the same Noodletasia. The sauces were so sweet, the food was inedible.   I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I love to eat here for lunch - like once a week! I love their pad thai, pad see yew (sp?), ginger salad, miso soup, sushi rolls, steamed dumplings ... okay - I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it was Great! Our waitress was Sonia who provided friendly and quick service, always with a smile. The food was excellent, we were a party of four and ordered a wide variety of menu items. We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have great sushi! You must try the Smoked Salmon Sashimi! Also their Maki Rolls are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I had the Buddha bowl, and was impressed with how good it was!  It consisted of vegetable broth, tofu, tofu noodles, and mixed veggies. I enjoyed a crispy vegetable roll too.  It was all delicious! The staff was friendly, and very knowledgeable about which items on their menu are vegan.  They also don't mind if you make substitutions."}
{"text":"This is always my go to place. I've never had anything here I don't like! It's very affordable, nice atmosphere, amazing food, and the servers are always on top of making your experience the very best. I love it here and would recommend it to everyone! The Yummy noodle bowl and chicken broccoli are my favorite. If you like spicy, the scallion chicken never fails! Also, their hot teas are fresh & the manager is always so friendly! Love love love it."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I stopped in to give this place a try. I was on my way to a friends house and had an hour to kill so I was by myself. Sat at the sushi bar. Was greatest quickly and served a sort of cabbage appetizer. It was very good. Started with a speciality roll that was extremely good. Than I had eel, white tuna and tuna sashimi. Everything was fresh and service was great. I'll return with my family next time !"}
{"text":"My wife, Jackie O, and I eat here at least every two weeks. Tommy, the owner, is always there with a smile. He should be smiling! This place is awesome.   The ambiance is cozy yet fun. We regularly order sushi along with apps and entrees. The sushi usually takes a while but is worth the wait. My wife always gets Pad Thai, which she says is not entirely authentic, but delicious enough to give her \"Pad Thai Cravings\".   The fish is consistently fresh and the specialty rolls are barely 10 bucks unlike some overpriced sushi places nearby.   Service is great 95% of the time, although every place has it's bad days.   Beer, wine and sake could be updated. Overall this is a great regular hangout. Be prepared to spend very little and have leftovers."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! If the food isn't authentic enough, and if they can make it, they'll let you order off the menu! One of the best places I have found in the Lake Norman Area for asian food."}
{"text":"Scallion chicken was great. Just like it was when the owner ran the Lotus 28."}
{"text":"I had the no mercy roll and spicy tuna roll. The food was great with a nice presentation. Service was quick and courteous.  The environment was pleasant and relaxing. I recommend this restaurant for great sushi."}
{"text":"I love Asian food, and these place has it all. I had the Korean bowl which was so yummy. I can't wait to go back and try something new. Love the place, it is clean, modern, and the customer service is very good."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant with great staff and a wonderful owner. There are all Types of Asian foods here. The sushi is great. My favorite is the Singapore rice noodles, a curry dish with just the right kick. My kids love the Mongolian beef and scallion chicken. Just writing this review makes me want to go back and eat. Everything is reasonably priced including the drinks and the decor is neat and clean. I've taken quite a few friends and clients to this place and everyone has loved it. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 2 stars due to service and food taste, but first:  1. This restaurant is not small kid friendly. Didn't take anything away from them but beware parents of small children. I'd go with bigger kids or with the spouse  2. The portions are generous...with no kids menu I ordered noodles for the kids which was quite enough for us all. Ended up canceling the 2nd order because of it.  3. Food was bleh. We got the chicken lo mein and it was not flavorful and half the noodles were cold while I other half was hot.  4. Service. Lowest part of score was service. I purposely told the waiter it was out first time there,hoping she'd tell me about the menu, popular dishes, sushi etc. she just shrugged and said \"ok, ill comeback\".it took awhile for her to return, when she did I had to ask for a sushi menu after realizing I didn't get one...another wait. After she brought my order...never saw her again. Had to ask another waitress if she could get my waitress to bring the check,she let her coworker bring it!   As I write this, I regret leaving her a 25%tip and only did it because I had small rambunctious kids in a non kid friendly restaurant although we were not there long and left and ate somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I was convinced to come back and try it out again. As we had a grupon and at one time I did like this place here we are. Well tonight the food was much better as was the service, although we did have to tell them to wait to being the entree until we were finished with the appetizer. So not to shabby."}
{"text":"I took my mother out to lunch here for her birthday; it was the two of us and my two small children.   I really enjoyed this little place. Judging from the outside, it's nothing impressive, and I thought at first that it was a chain. The inside, however, it decorated quite nicely and although it was a bit slow (mid-afternoon), the service was on point.   During our meal, the owner Tommy came by to ensure that everything met our expectations. My mom has eaten here many times and assures me he is almost always present, keeping an eye on things.   My mom had the green tea and I had a wonderful loose-brewed Coconut Chai black tea blend. Fantastic!    The egg drop soup was a bit thick, but the Hot and Sour Soup was fantastic. Loads of veggies. My kids really loved it. The fried noodles served with the soup were fresh and crisp and thankfully didn't taste like they had been fried in the same oil as a million egg rolls.   We split plates of Chicken Broccoli, Cashew Chicken, and Chicken Lo Mein. Everything tasted GREAT and came with white/fried rice as well as egg roll/spring roll on the side, per the lunch menu.   I will admit that even with 4 people eating (and my kids both had 2 helpings of lo mein) we couldn't finish all of our food. For less than $30, this place deserves 5 stars in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it.  But, nothing special.  I'd rather go to a random \"hole in the wall\" Chinese place for a lunch that would be $2 cheaper.  I got the Bejing Noodle Bowl.  The duck was dry, the rice noodles angel hair thin, were bland, and didn't have great texture.  The cabbage wilted quickly.  Maybe I didn't get the right thing.  Maybe my hopes were up as I have eaten some amazing duck soups in major cities this summer.  Will give it another chance some time, but not in any hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Either take out or dine in, you wont be disappointed.   Pretty much everything on the menus is awesome.  It also helps that the owner and staff are super friendly and accommodating. My favorites?  The Pho!"}
{"text":"Place no longer good. Crazy how new owners ran this place down by offering less for more $"}
{"text":"Best Noodles in the North Charlotte/LKN area. I would have to say the Singapore Street Noodles are the absolute best item on the menu, spicy, ample amounts of chicken/shrimp, and and a perfect amount of curry. The noodle bowls are on point as well. I live around the corner so I eat here once a week and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Noodletasia is kind of the jack of all trades when it comes to Asian cuisine in this area.  Everything is good with, of course, a few stars!  Ambiance is great in here.  They have 3 different rooms and each has different seating/tables.  Staff is typically really helpful and courteous.   The food never takes too long and always comes out correct and hot! I strongly suggest trying the mongolian beef sometime!  Sushi is good...not too flashy but they do have a couple superb rolls (green catepillar + two face are my favorites).    All in all, a great place to go for a date, with a group of friends or even get take out from!  Definitely a local business that deserves some patronage!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware: looks like the place is under new management. New decor. New staff. New menus. Service was so slow that we were able to look up reviews on Yelp while we waited, saw the dismal change in food quality, and left before anyone even visited our table. I'm so disappointed to know that my faithful Asian fusion spot near the house is no more, but I'm hopeful that one of the 7 (I think?) competitors within 2 miles can win me over."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a high rating.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish.    I had kimchi with beef bowl with hot and sour soup.  The soup was ok.  Kimchi with beef bowl was terrible.  I could not eat it at all.  Honestly I am not sure if I would go back there again.  I also tasted sweet and sour chicken while I was there.  Man... Did they get confused with catchup as soy sauce? It tasted more like catchup than sweet and sour sauce.  Is catchup sweet and sour? Now I am all confused."}
{"text":"\"This is a really good choice.\" High praise coming from a busy top level executive after lunching at Noodletasia. The food is well prepared and flavored and so so delicious. Noodle soup is perfect for an overcast rainy day, especially if away from home but longing for authentic Asian food!  I was rather delighted to find an item called \"Surprise Me\" on the menu. When dining in groups, there's the likelihood of the 'I don't knows' so this was a perfect appetizer to start. I specifically didn't ask what the dish included but did enjoy the balance of crunch and tenderness of the fish, all paired with the colorful sauce on the plate.  Noodletasia is a place I'm looking forward to returning to so I can sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of our \"go to\" spots in the Huntersville area. The sushi is always amazing and you get plenty for a really decent price. My husband goes crazy over any of the noodle bowls. Great service, too."}
{"text":"I've been to Noodletasia 3 times now, twice with sushi and tonight the Udon bowl and my friend got the Mongolian beef and it's always been good.  They have warned that lunch is packed, as they do a noodle bowl and sushi special, but dinner it's pretty sedate, weekday or weekend.  Food is tasty, tea is loose leaf, and everything comes out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Noodletasia. I ordered from takeout with this trip. Didn't know they had a separate section of their restaurant for takeout, but that was greatly appreciated and convenient. I always order the chicken lettuce wraps which are delicious. I also get fried rice, spring rolls, and sushi. They're all great! The staff members are very polite and helpful too."}
{"text":"Noodletasia is pretty delicious. Their soups, entrees and sushi have all been good choices. I also love the pickled vegetables they give you to start. The variety of the menu is good because there is always something I want to eat."}
{"text":"Loved this little place...great service. A little confusing to find if you are just passing through but worth the search,,free little nice salad, had cashew shrimp, rice and veggie roll plenty of food.she gave us a sample of a dessert ,an Oreo cookie deep fried in batter omg.  Yummy. Prices good and everyone very friendly.hope to go back next year on our way home from Florida"}
{"text":"This is the best noodle place in huntersville! I love the Singapore noodles (it seems to be my staple there). My mother had the double happiness and had them make it spicy.... We were both very happy with them."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high reviews associated with this restaurant but the dishes that my girlfriend and I were not that great.  First of all, when I order spicy food in an Asian restaurant I expect it to be spicy and it was not.  After asking our waitress for more chilies to increase the heat level she never came back with them.  Also, when it came to my girlfriend's dish the shrimp was extremely fishy and she didn't finish her plate.  All in all, it was a waste of twenty dollars and I doubt we will give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place offers a good mixture of Asian dishes. Large menu, great for every type of eater (omnivore, pescatarian, meatarian, vegetarian and vegan). I enjoy their noodle bowls which are very filling. I recommend trying their Coconut Chai tea which is very flavorful with the right amount of omph. Their vegetable rolls are on the greasy side. Staff is friendly and service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back! Sushi was Great!!! I was a bit afraid about reading a review in yelp about this place being dirty but I didn't think so at all! The only thing negative was the miso soup was way to salty and weak with ingredients- needs some shrimp in it and onions - just broth and tofu is weak! Service was great! I would definitely go back and that says slot right there!!! And was priced very reasonable!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband I are huge fans of this place. The sushi is outstanding. Our favorite dish is the Szechuan Noodle Bowl. The service is always great."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst \"asian\" food we have ever experienced. Try Eez or Ensos. The quality is so,poor we tossed it."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened in the past 6 months or so, but the food quality and flavor have significantly declined since my last visit here. My husband ordered the seafood delight, which came with bland fried rice, and was itself very lacking in flavor and drowning in an overly sweet sauce.   I ordered the Pho (my favorite Vietnamese dish by far) and my biggest problem with it was that the beef in it was pre-fried with a handful of cilantro dumped on top. I prefer the traditional serving style with the assorted additions (cilantro, basil, jalapeños, bean sprouts, hoisin and chili sauces) served on the side.   We ordered the pan fried dumplings as an appetizer, which were ok, but nothing special. We also ordered the Pink Lady roll to try the sushi and were pretty disappointed. The pieces felt mushy and include what has to be the most flavorless salmon I've ever ate.   Overall my two stars are from the excellent service we encountered and the prompt arrival of both our drinks and food. I would not however recommend that anyone I know choose to dine here."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it. The inside of the restaurant is bigger and nicer than it looks on the outside. We had crab rangoons for an appetizer and we each got one of the noodle bowls as our entrees. All of it was delicious. The service was also very fast despite us stopping in at 6pm on a Saturday. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"There is a huge difference in this restaurant now that Tommy is no longer here. I stopped by after work early on my way home because I was starving and they had just opened. After I was seated I heard the hostess tell the server he had a table and his response was \"All ready?\" I'm sorry, don't open at a particular hour if you don't want customers. The food is average now. I don't think I would go out of my way or plan to go here...I might if it is convenient  and on my way home.   I tried crab rangoon and pork bun appetizers...they are average and the sushi has had a slight dip in quality and taste. I ordered some of my favorites and a couple of new ones I had had before and enjoyed (Bubba Shrimp) and they were nearly as good as before. There is just a huge difference in atmosphere and quality of service now that he is no longer here and a difference in the quality of food.   I will say I had to ask for a plate for my sushi, chopsticks and the shrimp and eel sauce I asked with my sushi more then twice. I would also highly suggest that servers learn to speak in a lower voice, out of ear shot or not at all if they are going to continue to laugh and joke about their paying customers and not to keep yawning where customers can see and hear.   I also asked for my check at one point because the servers were busy putting together silverware and I had a feeling it would take awhile to get the check when I was done. My server told me he would just bring it to me when I was done (not when I asked for it). So, I sat and watched my server and other servers sitting at the sushi bar chatting and cleaning silverware for a good ten minutes before he even looked at my table."}
{"text":"Made my first visit out for lunch and I was rather surprised. Not going to lie, expected to see take-out quality food being served on a dish instead of a box. Wrong. Please note, I only went for the lunch specials and not their vast sushi checklist and dinner specials. I will come back to try the sushi to get a better feel for the restaurant and give an updated rating when that time comes.   I ordered the General Tso's Chicken Combo w/ white rice and egg roll. It ACTUALLY had chicken and not slathered in breading that's hiding a sliver of chicken inside. It wasn't doughy at all and the flavor was definitely there. Rice was of usual restaurant quality, so it's adequate for my tastes. Egg roll was filled with cabbage and a little meat slurry mixed throughout. Eh. Not a fan of mainly veggie filled egg rolls. But, hey, if you haven't had any different kind of egg rolls, then you wouldn't know the difference. Overall though, the combo was great and all of them cost $5.75. Not bad at all.   The service was excellent and attentive. I only had an hour for lunch and they got me in and out within 35 mins. Interior decorating is clean and simple and no tacky Asian inspired \"art.\" Well maintained and in a great location inside the Rosedale Shopping Center."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good but I can't go far enough to recommend more than two dishes. The absolute best meal available and all you need consists of the Vegan Noodles, which is incredible.   I also like the Hong Kong.   The sushi is okay. Nothing fantastic.   Also, the chopsticks are horrible. They have splinters and break easily... I don't know what the deal is. Outside of that, the food is still good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant which has been a go-to for years has gone from excellent to mediocre at best.  All of our favorite dishes no longer resemble or taste like the prior owners version. Highly disappointed and unhappy with the changes."}
{"text":"Avocado was hard in the sushi. The noodles were over cooked as well. Not our favorite."}
{"text":"We were looking for some sushi and the previous reviews suggested Noodletasia was a good place (first time here).  I'm not a sushi fan but my dinner partner is, so we gave it a shot.  The scallion chicken was great and my friend called the sushi awesome.  The volcano (sushi dish) was the better of the two selections that he had and would rate 5 stars.  The fried rice was very good, but I wouldn't order the egg rolls again even though the skins were nice and crisp.  The chicken wings were tender and crisp with a hint of ginger. The price was better than reasonable.  I would go there again and try more menu selections.  I don't think that I'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has the best noodle bowls around. I love the hong kong noodle bowl (So yummy) and its very affordable. One of our favorite things other than the price and portions is that we can bring our five yearold here to eat. They do a lot to accomodate the kids (Changing TV stations and making custom chop sticks that are kid friendly) We have made this one of our favorite stops for fusion style asian food."}
{"text":"The food was great I got the curry noodle bowl I loved it. I tried my friends dumpling appetizer it was delicious !  Are waitress was underage so she couldn't recommend any alcohol beverages to me but she was nice when it came down to her customer service.. I would deff go back to this restaurant again to try more of the menu. Oh and I forgot to add the sake was amazing great portion size as well!"}
{"text":"I have to echo everyone else's sentiments: this place used to be amazing, but things have changed, and I don't think I'll be going back. My favorite noodle bowl is gone from the menu and the one I ordered to replace it was bland and all its ingredients were overcooked. Bye, Noodletasia. It was great while it lasted."}
{"text":"There are not enough stars to give Noodletasia. Everything I have ordered has always been delicious and the staff are always wonderful and helpful. There are a very small number of restaurants that I have been to that treat you this well, and they deserve every bit of praise that they earn."}
{"text":"Started with the Tempura Shrimp sushi which was excellent. Ordered the lunch specials. My wife ordered Kung Pow Chicken and was able to make it less spicy for our toddler. I ordered the Orange Chicken with egg roll and fried rice. Kung Pow was decent, but we did request less spice, so it would be unfair to give a negative review. The orange chicken was great. We would definitely eat here again and highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. We have been going to Noodletasia for over five years and loved it. Tommy was fabulous. From what we experienced today Tommy is no longer there. I asked if there was new a new owner and first was told new management, then new owner.  We order tempura and a sushi roll first and then 2 entrees. After over 30 minutes our entrees arrived. Waitress seemed confused that we asked where the appetizers were. She forgot to put the order into the kitchen. On both entrees the chicken was horribly overcooked. We even pulled all the chicken out of the terryaki bowl since it was not edible. Older gentleman comes and asks how everything is. We explain we are still waiting on apps. He says the kitchen is backed up yet there were only three other tables in the restaurant. Waitress shows up with a sushi roll, not close to the one we ordered. She takes it back. Again we are asked how is everything and we ask again for the tempura. Ten minutes later we are asked again how is everything and we ask about where the sushi roll that we ordered. She explains the chef doesn't know how to make it, he's new. Now over an hour and no appetizer yet. We are done with the meal. Older gentleman comes to the table again. I ask about the tempura. This surprises him since he has no idea we ordered it. Says waitress is new but they are doing their best. He brings a young lady over, says she is the neew manager. She offers 10% off our meal. What a joke. Thne tempura finally arrives and is grossly undercooked.  It felt like a family took over and it was their first day. Now we understand why the place was almost empty at prime Saturday lunch time.  We will not be back unless we hear that Tommy is runing it again."}
{"text":"We went here last night since it's across from the hospital but we had Tom yum, singnapore noodles,  and a few other dishes, but it was lovely! The decor was very contemporary and the owner even had a few conversations with us, overall I had a wonderful dining experience here.. Will definently tell others and continue coming back here!"}
{"text":"When Tommy was the owner, this was a GREAT restaurant.  Now, not so good.  Need a  minimum purchase of $5.  Want just an egg roll to snack on?  No need to stop here anymore.  Try Fusion 108 which is right around round the corner."}
{"text":"Love the Dan Dan noodles!  Great flavor with a nice spicy kick. I was disappointed in the cashew chicken- I was surprised it was battered chicken which isn't my style."}
{"text":"We picked up an order on Friday and I loved the food so much I demanded my birthday dinner be there the next night. The sushi is amazing and the food is great as well. Prices are very reasonable also. I highly recommend the volcano and beauty & the beast rolls."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for dinner with my daughter for the 1st time. She had a Chicken rice bowl and I had the Yummy Noodle bowl (make it Hot) and we shared a California roll.  Everything was extremely good and the service was excellent.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Not seeing what everyone is raving about. I'll try it one more time in the future and update my review. Until then, meh."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff. Prices aren't bad either. I'd like you to crank up your air conditioning a little bit please!"}
{"text":"So we went back and we were so excited. My husband was dying to try the No Mercy roll as recommended by our previous, wonderful waitress and I was jonesin for some more noodles. This time we were treated to not one but three people serving us. The two young, caucasian girls seem clueless. Sweet but clueless; as a former server, I know that just doesn't cut it.   Previously, my husband- a curry neophite- had been told they could adjust the heat in any dish so he may ease into the curry experience. Our main server said they couldn't. Hubs wisely asked for the sauce on the side. He really enjoyed the No Mercy roll and the extra salad but the curry sauce was far too strong for him. We were also disappointed to see hot pink ginger on his plate (unlike before).   The staff was attentive, my glass was never more than 1/2 empty, my noodles rocked and the prices are great but I took away one star for the clueless staff, lack of child friendly drinks (your choice for them is sweet tea, soda or water),  the ginger that wasn't fresh aand being told two different things by two different people."}
{"text":"I went with my husband, oldest and youngest sons for dinner. It was much nicer inside than I expected. It has a \"chill\" atmosphere. Our food was good, tea not so good. They serve wine so it would be a nice \"date night\" place if you wanted something quiet and not too pricey.   We will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"We were regular weekly customers before new management took over and always knew we would get outstanding service, outstanding food at a reasonable price. Tried it tonight for the first time and we were so very disappointed in the food, the service and the prices. The food was undercooked and bland. Didn't finish anything we ordered which we rarely do. Walked away hungry. Yes.. Food was that bad. Service was less than ok. Why did they have to \"fix\" it when it wasn't broken? We paid the bill in full but we will not return."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the environment Noodletasia offers; modern-esque decor and prompt and friendly staff. And c'mon, lets be honest. The name is awesome.  I ordered Edamame and the bowl of it was huge! Almost too salted but good none the less. For dinner I had the Udon Noodle Bowl with Tofu (also a huge proportion of food), which consisted of bean sprouts, broth, udon and chunks of fresh tofu. It wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad either. Minus one thing: as a vegan, I can notice what kind of broth there is. It was chicken broth in my vegetarian dish. Yuck. I didn't drink the broth and I picked out the edible stuff but yeah, super not cool. Make sure to ask if you are vegetarian/vegan and are ordering a noodle bowl (or really anything... just to be safe)."}
{"text":"Place didn't really look open but I was looking for a good Asian restaurant for lunch.  Decent lunch special, Noodle bowl + Maki roll for $9+  Delicious eel maki roll! - good wasabi and ginger  - rice was a tad on the moist side but didn't really affect the taste/texture.  Szechuan noodle bowl, was a bit surprised though. - more like a soup or pho.   This was a little disappointing (only because I expected a lot less broth in a noodle bowl) - large flat noodles, more like the pastry in a southern chicken pastry dish.  Many too large to get on spoon.  - just the right amount of spicy - beef is cooked just right but pieces are too large (not cut all the way through) - bean sprouts are only good for change of texture.  - overall dish is clumsy (to eat) and one note.   Chocolate fortune cookie is good!  Friendly prompt service.   I'd try it again, knowing what to expect.  ----  Update: Tried it again!  Got the fried noodles this time.  It was pretty oily - but a lot of food.    Maybe I'll stick with the sushi."}
{"text":"Came here because of the good rating on yelp and was very disappointed. I got pho and it was so salty I couldn't eat it. The service was slow and my boyfriend got the Pad Thai and it was tasteless and very salty. Wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"The service was very attentive here, I think the server re-filled my Diet Coke no less than four times. I had the wonton soup, the wasabi wasabi roll, and a side of edamame, all of which were quite delicious. Prices were reasonable, a bit more expensive than KO but not quite as pricey as Enso. The atmosphere was also very cool - it was minimalist/modern and appeared to be quite clean. I'm excited to be working in this neck of the woods post 2013 so I can visit again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in and around Charlotte! My boyfriend lives close to Noodletasia and needless to say, I want to eat here EVERY DAY. My personal favorite is the Vegan stir-fried noodles with added chicken (which they don't have on the lunch menu but will still make them if you ask). They are yummy and no one makes them like Noodletasia. On days when I feel like I eat too much of the Vegan noodles, I go for my second favorite, the Hong Kong noodle bowl. My boyfriend loves their sushi too (I'm not a big fan of sushi). The only reason I don't think they are worth 5 stars is the terrible disposabe chopsticks that they have here. They are poor quality wood with splinters that almost always hurt my fingers. I'm always tempted to pick up some chopsticks from Pei Wei and use those here. With a classy place as Noodletasia, I wish they invested more on better quality chop sticks. But the delicious food still guarantees regular customers like us"}
{"text":"My first ever one star review. I don't know what happened to Noodletasia, but I suspect they're under new ownership and management. We got food there tonight and it was one of the worst experiences I've had in recent years. It started with a flyer in the mail, a menu with \"30% off\" handwritten in red marker. \"Kind of a cheap way to do a coupon\" I commented. Our first mistake was not looking at the menu. After all we eat there a lot and know what we like. Liked, I should say, because it's not the same menu. Missed that clue. Anyway we show up at the restaurant and they've changed the layout a bit. Nothing major, but that was another missed clue. The wait staff seemed a bit frazzled even though it wasn't all that busy, like they didn't quite know what they were doing. Clue #3, and by now I was beginning to suspect that this wasn't the same Noodletasia. The menus, once nicely bound and elegant, were now just printed on plain sheets of paper and stapled together. A lot had changed on the menu, with signature dishes replaced with generic Chinese food. We ended up getting our food to go, and that's probably for the best. The first thing I noticed when we got home was that the generic packets of \"soy sauce\" weren't actually soy sauce. Not a soybean to be found on the list of ingredients, just water, salt, corn syrup, and coloring. One last clue for what was ahead. I'm sure I won't surprise anyone when I say the food was bad. The chicken in my wife's meal was tough and dry. That's still better than what I got - mine was mostly raw. Obviously I can't tell you how it tasted since it went straight to the trash. Even the rice was overcooked. Overall a miserable experience. Goodbye Noodletasia. You used to be one of our favorites. With as many choices as there are for decent Asian food in the area we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Oh man... this place is pretty darn good if you are into noodles.  If you have a noodle fetish.. this will ease that craving.  For those that don't, allow me to explain the noodle fetish.  When I was growing up, it was always, rice , and rice and more rice. Anything other than rice was exotic.     Rice was boring, dry and requires jaw exercises , all that chewing leaves one parched and tired. Noodles on the hand was savory, slupry delicious soup, warms you up quick, all - in - one meal, a novelty and exciting to the sense and the palatte.  Oh yes... noodles are like having a mistress that you visit occasionally... so forbidden.. kinda exciting and naughty.  . Ahhhhhhh yesss.... noodles.... yummmm....   Noodletasia is like noodle wonderland. I had their Curry Noodle Surprise.. it was heavenly good. The soul of the noodle is a concoction of spicy coconut south indian curry based soup.  The chicken topping is generous and compliments the sweetness of the soup.  Buddy of mine went with the kimchee rice and it exceeded his korean tastebuds.. so this place has some creds to it.. if it passes my buddies taste test.. you know this is legit.  I will be back .... this is one hot mama of a noodle joint.."}
{"text":"Noodletasia...even the name evokes curiosity!   This little fusion restaurant is located right off of Gilead Rd., nestled in a multi-use shopping center. Inside, Noodletastia is pretty slick...a nice amount of tables and modern interior. Hubs and I popped in for a quick lunch and were impressed with the friendly service and expansive menu. The owner was very accommodating and seemed to personally greet every one of his patrons.   I ordered the Kim Chee noodle bowl - a huge bowl of noodles, green onions, bok choy and shrimp simmering (actually boiling!) in a spicy both. The flavor of the Kim Chee bowl was super tasty - hot and spicy with a (favorable) sour aftertaste. While the noodle bowl had a great flavor, I had such a problem consuming it! The bowl was larger than my head and there was so much broth encompassing the long noodles, veggies and shrimp I didn't know whether to use the spoon ladle they gave me or my fork. And naturally, because of my feeding attempts I ended up with half of the noodle bowl splattered on my white shirt. HOT. I was, however, quite enamored with the chocolate fortune cookies we received with our bill!   Truly, though, the flavor was delicious but the end result was frustrating for me because a) I was hungry and couldn't get enough food in my mouth and b) I ended up with an orange splattered shirt. Maybe if the noodles were cut in half or if there was a better apparatus for taking it down, I would have been more satisfied and less splatter-fied. Next time I hit up Noodletasia I'm going to order something a bit more, \"consumer friendly\"!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all. Not because of the food.... which I never even got to try.... but because of the horrible customer service. I arrived with a party of three other people for lunch and immediately noticed at the empty hostess station there was a very nice credit card laying there by itself. Someone could have easily grabbed it.   After waiting about 5 or more minutes a person finally came up to us and seated us. Then we waited another 15 min to be acknowledged by our waiter. They dropped off the menus and we never saw her again. The place wasn't even packed so there was no reason for us to be ignored. We waited 20 minutes trying to flag someone to come take our order but finally got up and left... and no one acknowledged us on our way out.   So if you are wanting this type of food I highly recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was super slowww, but well worth the wait. Even the little cabbage salad they give you while you wait is really good. Tonight I got the shrimp with lobster sauce and fried rice. Awesome, it's like a garlicky, creamy egg drop soup with shrimp. Even my picky eater went to town on his shrimp fried rice. I have to say, the Inferno Tower was the bomb. It's like a crunch roll with imitation crab and tuna. The name kind of implied that it would be spicy, but it's not. Either way, really delicious.   We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was the second and last time I'll be ordering from Noodletasia. The first time, about a month ago, we ordered online and my husband went to pick it up.  They never got the order. While my husband waited for them to complete it they admitted that their online ordering has done this before but they made no effort to offer anything for our trouble.   Fast forward to today, we were persuaded by the Groupon and thought by phoning in the order we'd have better luck. When we went to pick up they had no idea where our order was or how to run the Groupon. They eventually did find the order though and when we got home and started going through the order and we were given Steamed Chicken with brown rice instead of the Sweet and Sour Chicken with fried rice we ordered. I called to see if I could go back to the restaurant to exchange it (which in my opinion in the Least they could do) and the owner/manager said they are too busy so they can't accept any exchanges. Okay...  Now the quality, first time around was alright. Basic Chinese food. This time we decided to try their noodle bowls and sushi. Sushi tastes premade. The tempura shrimp in one roll was stiff, cold and soggy. The Ramen was the worst I've ever had. I can make better ramen. He steamed chicken we got by accident was mushy and gross. The fried rice was pretty good but it's pretty hard to mess that up.   So, needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably half a dozen times as I live a few miles down the road. Every time I come, I wonder why I don't come more often. The staff is very friendly without being overbearing, and the owner seems to always be there at least for dinner service, he seemingly greets every patron too which I always appreciate.   I usually stick to the sushi menu, so I can't speak to the cooked menu items. The Green Catepillar is one of my favorites. I also always choose a \"Surpise Me\" roll, and I've never been disappointed. The sushi just literally makes up something on the spot and it's always something I've never seen before. All the rolls are $8-$10 and would easily be in the $14-$16 at other sushi restaurants in a 10 mile radius. They also offer amazing nigiri and sashimi, many for only $1 - and large portions.   They also often bring tempura-fried oreos to the table if you're a regular or especially friendly. I wouldn't care what the interior of this place looked like as good and as reasonably-priced as the food is, but it just adds a gold star that it is cute and funky."}
{"text":"With all the good reviews and was craving for sushi, we gave Noodletasia a shot for dinner before it closed for the night.   The waitress are super kind and greeted us with a warm welcoming as well as asking us if we needed a highchair for our 23 month old toddler. Sat us down right away and there was quite a few people in there when we got there. The place looks really \"dead\" on the outside, but once you walk in, it's like a modern style interior restaurant and I liked it.  Brought out our drinks and a plate of salad. Don't know what it was called, but it was yummy.  We ordered the Bubba Shrimp, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Spicy Tuna and Double Pork for main course. Of course, being the pregnant lady I am, I couldn't eat the spicy tuna one but on the look of my husband's face, he loved it. The Bubba Shrimp and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon were AMAZING! Oh my goodness. Like my mouth had an orgasm or something, it was really delicious and I've been on a search for good sushi and I think I've found the place. Definitely worth the 30 minute drive and my husband agree too.  The Double Pork was good, I expected more meat but it was covered in vegetables so I would just probably come for sushi. I am willing to try something new each time I go so I'm quite excited to go back. Love the service there too, it was fast.   Definitely will come back. 5-star for everything!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure they have such bad reviews. We have come here the past couple of years and it is our favorite Chinese restaurant. We love the food here and it is good quality. There was only one time where the service was bad, but there are a lot of  restaurants where service is bad ALL THE TIME. It could have been just an off night. It didn't stop us from coming back again. We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I took my family to Noodletasia after reading the reviews on Yelp. I was sorely disappointed.  The decor is nice, the service friendly and prompt, but the food was horrible. We started with Crab Rangoon which was burnt. The dipping sauce they provided was sweet and sour, no better than what you would get at Panda Express.  For dinner we ordered a variety of entrees. Two of my kids ordered Pho which was tolerable. The shrimp in the Honey and Walnut shrimp were crispy, which was nice, but the sauce was SOOO thick. It was like sweetened mayo. The salmon nigiri was possibly the worst I have ever had. It tasted like it had just come out of a plastic bag. My oldest daughter ordered a crunchy roll which I didn't try, but she only ate half because it was soggy. The beef in the beef chow fun tasted good, but the noodles were over cooked and mushy. Honestly, there was very little that was positive about the food. I may be spoiled because I travel a lot and currently live in San Diego where the food is infinitely better, but even my kids thought the dinner was sub-par.  We did order the mochi ice cream for dessert and I will say that the mochi was pretty dang good. We had mango, strawberry, chocolate and red bean. All were very good. Overall, this was a VERY SLIGHT step above Panda Express (except the mochi). With tip it was almost $80 for the 5 of us and none of us felt satisfied (again, except the mochi). So . . .  it's a great place for dessert . . ."}
{"text":"Noodletasia is tucked away in a shopping center off Gilead Road in Huntersville.  I've been here too many times to count, and this is always my go-to place for a great Asian meal.  They are also our first choice for carryout.  They do a brisk carryout business, and even have a separate area connected to the restaurant where you can wait for your meal.  Now, if the offered delivery, we'd eat there at least a few times a month...that's how much I like Noodletasia!  We have enjoyed just about everything we have tried there.  They offer quite a few varieties of (soup) noodle bowls, lots of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese dishes, as well as sushi.  The portion sizes are generally large enough to have leftovers.    For starters, we usually have the crystal shrimp dumplings, basil rolls, and soup (if we are not getting a noodle bowl as our entree).  For something light, I love their shrimp noodle salad with ginger dressing.  It's a big enough portion for a meal, the shrimp are grilled perfectly, and the dressing is amazing.  The sushi is also good for a light meal, but some of the sushi items I have tried are a tad bland.  (I never use soy sauce, but some of them require it for seasoning).     One other minor complaint I have is that while they give you a ton of shrimp in their stir fried noodle and rice dishes, the shrimp are very small.  I would rather have fewer--and larger--shrimp in these dishes.  Service is always quick and attentive.  I also like the fact that they serve a variety of reasonably priced hot teas.    You definitely need to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The place is kind of hard to find. It's in a shopping center, in a corner. It's a tree kind of blocking the sign. Anyway, the food and service is excellent and I love the scenery! I'll, definitely, be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi was decent and the price I felt was fair. I had the green caterpillar rolls. I also got the Beijing noodle bowl and was disappointed: the broth was fairly bland and the duck was dry (I realize duck is naturally dry but this was notably dry). The service was very fast and friendly. Overall a decent albeit pricey first experience."}
{"text":"Noodletasia has amazing food! The service is always nice and friendly even if it is sometimes a little on the slower side. I personally am not a fan of sushi but my family raves about it! My brother comes here specifically for the sushi :-)   The owner, Tommy, walks around and says hi and you see him bringing food out etc. but they have a good mixture of food to offer. They have things from sesame chicken to tofu and snow peas. The Canton noodles (pan fried noodles) are amazing as well! Most Chinese places don't have that dish (keeping my fingers crossed for chow fun to show up on the menu)!  One thing I really do love, aside from the calm/family atmosphere, is that you get good food, good service, and you're not breaking the bank. Food is always fresh and even if you want to change dishes (chicken instead of beef or snow peas instead of broccoli etc) they always accommodate with no hassle.  Great sit down for some affordable Chinese food. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Decent. It was better when Tommy was there. The last time I went to pick up food, I asked if they had spare ribs? No. I got wonton soup, sesame chicken, and lo-mein. All of it was good, not great. But that's not what stood out. I went to use the bathroom and the door wouldn't lock. Then I noticed the toilet was running. Then I saw a Walgreen's plastic bag in the garbage for a bag. And when I left the bathroom, the chef was standing right there, itching to get in. It's the little things. Not a bad option, but not great."}
{"text":"There's an old adage.   \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\".   This place used to be the bee's knees. Now it's like a wounded prize horse that needs to go to the glue factory.   One revered sushi Mecca has been reduced to a new owner who's ego and pride is wrapped in a front end remodel and a menu revamp. I'm all about the aforementioned if it's a plus. But holy moly, this place should be featured in the \"how to destroy a restaurant in record time\" reality series on One of those channels. We will NOT be coming back ever again unless one of the yelpers wants to take one for the team to see if it's changed.   BIG RED FLAG: 30% off for the month of August."}
{"text":"I love the curry surprise noodle bowl, changing the noodles to the thin rice noodles. My husband loves the pho noodle bowl, changing the noodles to tofu noodles, and the \"Dragon and Phoenix\"; switching between the two depending on his craving.  The kids have gotten the fantasy shrimp, teriyaki chicken rice bowl, and the dragon roll with added eel sauce, and they have loved them. I have gotten $5 sushi rolls before that were very very small and not worth the money, but the last two times I came (at lunch), they were normal sized and worth it.    I am happy to finally see a kids menu now, although there are only a few selections....maybe it will expand in the future to include items like teriyaki chicken.  Hint hint.  Overall we are happy with the menu, food, and friendly service."}
{"text":"The noodle meals were very good. I  would like to see the place get a little makeover. It is starting to show some good wear. But I did enjoy the meal and we were heading to the comedy  show and they put our meal in for a fast order. I had the Yaki udon and would have like to get beef but the shrimp was good. The Pad Thai I thought was a little spicy. But overall I like the place"}
{"text":"Hip decor with modern design and interesting original paintings. A menu with an emphasis on noodles served in styles from all over Asia but with consistent excellence and honesty to the source. Great sushi choice and prices. Unique teas served in a plentiful pot for $1.95. Precise and prompt service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service, as always, continues to be excellent.  Tommy, the owner, always makes his rounds.  The food on this cold evening was better than I remembered (Shrimp/rice bowl)!  Finally, I must say, the Apple Sake made me a fan!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out Noodletasia on Valentine's Day in an attempt to save some cash. I was disappointed on the drive over as I usually prefer a fancy, upscale, intimate dining experience on the ol' V-Day, but on the drive home I slapped myself for being so silly. Noodletasia, while not fancy smancy, was a great restaurant and I will definitely be going back.  It's a small place, yet the tables aren't packed close together, so you still have some privacy. The hostess greeted and sat us in notime flat, and the waitress came over shortly after with the pickled veggies and took our drink orders. The miss' and I split a carafe of the lychee sake ($8) which was mighty tasty. It didn't have the strong bite of alcohol and it had a nice, sweet taste.   For dinner we decided to share two orders of sushi and a bowl of noodles. We ordered the Green Lantern roll ($9) and the Two Face roll ($9). The Green Lantern was my preferred of the two and was a shrimp tempura rolled up with other stuff, topped with a slice of avacado and served along with a sauce of spicy mayo and eel sauce. I simply love the contrasting textures and temperatures of a tempura sushi roll, as the crunch and heat of the tempura item meld with the cold and soft roll. The Two Face roll was a disappointing pile of mush. The contents of the roll kept falling out, which is not a good thing in my book. Also, I was not a fan of the sauce that came with it, which was hot, spicy and just plain weird. I don't know what it was, but it reminded me of this \"conch sauce\" my parents brought home for me from a trip they took to Florida once.  For the oodles of noodles we shared a bowl of Yaki Udon ($8.75), which consisted of chicken, shrimp, bok choy, scallions and these delicious fat, slurpable noodles. I was pretty blown away by this dish and couldn't get over how great everything tasted. The shrimp were nice and firm, the bok choy was crunchy (at least the white ends were...my favorite part of bok choy), the noodles were thick and hearty and the flavorful sauce really tied the dish together.   I would definitely come back to Noodletasia. The combination of sushi and hot noodles is wonderful, and they definitely do the noodles right. If we're in the mood for just sushi I will definitely be going to Sushi at the Lake, but if the miss' gets a hankering for sushi and I'm not feeling it that night, you'll find us at Noodletasia."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious!  My husband and I tried out this new Sushi and Noodle bar and really enjoyed ourselves.  Portion size is more than adequate and the sushi  rolls are unique and tasty.  I tried the Tom Yum noodle bowl and it was great, a little spicy; a nice kick to it!  My hubby had the Gilead Roll, which is wrapped in rice paper instead of rice and seaweed.  It was different but really good.  To top off our yummy meal (also, they have a noodle bowl literally named Yummy Noodles so it must be so, I'm definitely trying it next time) we had a dessert....Tempura fried oreos...THAT'S RIGHT...FRIED OREOS, so good!  We were very pleased and will be sure to be back soon!"}
{"text":"We came because we had a coupon for 15% off our bill. Nothing really went wrong, but I do think this place was just very mediocre. We got one sushi roll to split which was really good. But the two Chinese dishes we got were meh. They tasted the same and definitely should not have. Our server was really friendly and super sweet. But if you're looking for a better than Panda Express type of food, I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I am an occasional diner at this restaurant. We went in for take out today and were greeted by Coco, who was a joy to talk to as she made recommendations on the various items on the menu. She even got our pre-ordered wings spiced to our taste up by the chef. The sweet chilli wings were some of the best wings I've ever had. They come smothered in a sauce teaming with natural flavors, sweet, spicy and fragrant with tastes and aromas of basil amongst other herbs. On Coco's recommendation, we tried the dancing scallops which are tempura fried scallops topped with what looked like uni and other savory ingredients. I used to be a professional caterer and consider myself quite the chef but I was blown away by this dish! I can honestly say that this was the best seafood platter I've ever had in my life and everyone should try it once or twice; you'll thank me for it. I have always loved the Singapore curry and get it on every occasion I visit the restaurant but the dancing scallops have become my new favorite dish. Coco gave me a chance to meet with chef Jim who had prepared these amazing dishes for us. He is as humble as he is talented and I can't wait to see what else chef Jim has brewing in the kitchen. By the way, after we tasted a bit of the food, we couldn't wait to get home and eat so we just sat right there in the restaurant and ate almost all of it. That's how good it was!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat out (or get take out from). Even our 4 and 6 year olds love it. The noodle bowls are fabulous. Curry surprise is the best. Love the sushi and they even have soy wrappers. Not on the menu so just ask. If you are in the area and in the mood for Asian definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch, and I've only ever had the Singapore noodles.  Spicy, with a Indian curry touch.  I ought to try some of their other noodle or rice dishes (I'm not a huge sushi fan)... but the Singapore noodles are just soo good...  (and less than $7).  On Sundays, while they are open during lunch hours, they only serve dinner portions.  Coming from I-77, turn right at the CVS stoplight, and it'll be on the left"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try Noodletasia because of the VARIETY on the menu. The issue with \"fusion\" restaurants is that they don't specialize in a particular cuisine. Some fusion restaurants are good and some are bad.   My service was not horrible BUT the food was totally bland. I ordered Chicken Ramen and my friend ordered the Yaki Udon Chicken. I felt like the Ramen was something I could have made at home. It was like they bought a pack of 99 cents pack of noodles from Walmart and served it. The broth was not flavorful, it tasted like water. As for the Yaki Udon the noodles were fine but the chicken tasted like it came straight from the refrigerator.   I hate to give this place a crappy review but it's definitely not the place you want to eat. If you're completely okay with bland and \"western-ized\" food then have a seat. I hate for people to think that this is how these noodle dishes should taste."}
