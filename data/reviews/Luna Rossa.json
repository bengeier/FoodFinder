{"text":"Really enjoyed it. We were a party of 3 girls and shared 2 plates. More than enough food. We shared the butternut squash ravioli and the lamb chops. Both were really good. Coming back."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing special. But the worst part was the service was terrible. Not worth the price for the ok food and terrible service! If you do go, order the pizza."}
{"text":"Ducked into Luna Rossa on a whim to get out of the crazy wind that was sweeping through Downtown last night. A friendly hostess seated us immediately, and a waiter was at our table to take our drink orders in a moment. The restaurant ambiance was a welcomed escape from the usual Fremont Street chaos... until the live entertainment passed out tambourines to a table full of kids... and encouraged them to make as much noise as possible throughout her Beatles tributes. Then for a moment it was Karaoke hour as she passed the mic over to a customer who wanted to belt out \"Sweet Caroline\" (and suddenly we wanted the tambourines back).   On to the food! Warm, soft bread was served promptly (though the olive oil and balsamic were a little behind). We ordered the meatballs in marinara sauce and the Luna Rossa pizza. Both were pretty good, but honestly nothing to write home about.   The service is what redeemed my experience at Luna Rossa. Our waiter was very attentive, quick and polite and we were welcomed and thanked by the hostess. The ambiance would have won me over as a fan if the tambourines were torched and mic reserved for the paid professionals."}
{"text":"Nona, e molta MOLTA maleducato!  Perche Ti comporti come un opsite del tua ristorante e un intruso? Il cibo e solo medicore (at best) e tu servizio e terrible. After living in this neighborhood for nearly 2 years, I have given Luna Rosa every last chance. Only Miguel, the 1 employee who is not a family member, seems to understand what good service is. The rest of the family are slow, rude and completely oblivious to the fact that some patrons parliamo italiano. I can only suspect that they survive on tourist patronage. Please do not waste your money on this outwardly rude and underwhelming family establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a September Sunday after riding the river mountain loop trail and ordered hearty comfort food (sausage sandwich and chicken parmigiana) on the terrace overlooking the little Lake Las Vegas. The flavors were excellent but the reason I took the trouble to write this review is that the bread on the sausage sandwich was obviously just baked seriously good crust white bread that is common in Europe but rare in Las Vegas, even at Italian restaurants. I asked the waiter where they bought the bread and he said they make it themselves. With that king of attention to detail I want to go back and sample some other dishes."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great crust, superior service and friendly staff.  Was the perfect meal for afternoon at the pool for hungry teenagers.  Restaurant has been in business 11 years which is a credit to their quality given the tough economic cycle they opened prior to and survived through."}
{"text":"This fabulous Italian restaurant sits in the village of Montelago on Lake Las Vegas,and is a great find. Miguel was our waiter for the two times we have visited for dinner. His wise direction has never steered us wrong. My wife and I are never disappointed with the lobster and shrimp stuffed ravioli and a nice bottle of Chianti or Pinot Noir with our dinner. The martini I had prior to dinner was perfect and had blue cheese stuffed olives. The restaurant gets crowded, but I have never seen the wait over 10 minutes. We have always made a rez for 6:30PM, and have promptly been seated. I don't know how or why people have rated this restaurant badly, as we have always been treated with respect and have always had a great meal. Ask for Miguel if you want to be treated the best."}
{"text":"Seems like a very random location for this restaurant, but I'm not complaining! Bf & I wandered in while we were exploring Fremont street and shared a Casertana Pizza (buffalo mozerella and basil) and Crostini della Tradizione. It was more than enough food for lunch, and our bill was around $20.  The pizza was a bit soggy but still very good. Not too heavy on the sauce which, in my opinion, is perfect. The crostini was one of the best things I tasted my whole 6 days in Vegas. Simple but SO good - I'd go back just for that.    We did feel a little out of place as everyone else in the restaurant (4 or 5 other tables) were speaking Italian.  A group of 4 were seated RIGHT next to us, while most of the restaurant remained empty, and they proceeded to give us semi dirty looks throughout our stay. It was awkward.   All the staff spoke Italian too, which was pretty cool.  Our waitress was fairly attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our food. You can eat outside, or inside if you want to pretend you're somewhere other than Fremont Street."}
{"text":"We've lived in the area for three years and only today that my friend and I got to try Luna Rossa for lunch. We've been to the other restaurants in the village quite a few times which are pretty good. Well, Luna Rossa was a disappointment. Felt like I was robbed. First, we ordered the Calamari Fritti. The menu price is $10.99. I was charged $16.  Second, I ordered the Penne Vodka. The waiter asked if I wanted chicken or shrimps. It's not after I got the check to find out  that I was charged $4 for the chicken. The menu (we ordered off the lunch menu) did not say anything about extra nor did the waiter.  The Chicken Parmesan was $15.95 which was the dinner price. Unfortunately, I did not bother to review the check until I got home as you think they are trustworthy. That was a mistake. The waiter kept on talking us into ordering alcohol. The bigger the bill, the bigger the tip? Needless to say this is off our list....again."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Luna Rosa! We were visiting Lake Las Vegas  just for the night and chose this restaurant in spite of mixed yelp reviews. Our waiter, Gianna, was the perfect combination of helpful and prompt without hovering and  his accent was delightful! I ordered the lobster ravioli - amazing! My dining partner. Had a risotto with mixed seafood dish, loved it. We will definitely eat here again! There was a free concert out by the lake that began just as we finished, perfect  addition to the evening."}
{"text":"When i tell you the most amazing pizza I have ever had.. a very simple Hawaiian  pizza. I asked for a little side of Marina. It was perfect. The taste. The texture. And when i tell you the bruchetta was gorgeous. It was insane how pretty it was, but the taste. Oh my gracious. It was so good.  Our waitress was lovely. So kind. I hope to one day be able to get back to this little gem."}
{"text":"Great, authentic restaurant in a very nice resort setting. Lots of Italian being spoken by the staff, lots of care taken with the food. We had a beautiful salad (it's harder than it sounds) and really good house-made pasta and gnocchi. Good wine list. One of our favorite meals from our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than Luna Rossa! You can sit outside and enjoy the lake, and often live music. The waiters are just attentive enough and speak Italian (big bonus). The wine list is impressive. AND, they are always very accommodating with our vegan choices."}
{"text":"My wife and I were greated by Brandon (ask fot him you'll thank me later) I ordered pepperoni pizza wife ordered lamb and calamari for drinks Italian bottle water and a cosmo for the Mrs. one og the other waiters poured tap water in our glass brandon saw it from across the room and replaced the bottle and glasses...after I asked for the chexk he brought out a complimentary desert...total bill was only $82"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a small group around December 22nd. The food (for 7 people) came out in three batches over 30 minutes -- some had finished eating by the time other's food arrived. The staff was not available even to refill water in the meantime -- let alone asking for reasons for delay.The bill was inaccurate and when we pointed it out, we were yelled at by the waiter (who earlier had told us that he moved from Italy over a year ago). Food was of average quality. Mandatory tip of 18% for such a terrible service!!  I will not return or suggest this to anyone. The Mexican restaurant at the Village at Lake Las Vegas on the other hand had a fantastic service and great food."}
{"text":"We went last night for our valentines anniversary. We were seated right on time as we had reservations. Our waiter ask the bus boy to give us water we did not get it until our soup was served. Our waiter was so enamored with the girl sitting behind us who was with her husband that he couldn't be bothered with us. All the while he was showering them with freebies such as Jell-O shots etc. our food was barely ok. We would of had another glass of wine but he didn't come around so we could order.. All in all it was a very bad dining experience for a very special day."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! I will never eat here again we had the most atrocious waitress of all time. She was lazy rude snappy and extremely annoyed that we wanted even the smallest things. The menu is 3 pages with one entire page dedicated to pizza after waiting 30 minutes to order she came and asked us for our order 3 people ordered pizza and she said \"no pizza, we to busy to order pizza no no, order something else\" then she turned around and walked away. We were so shocked with her. Not happy we all ordered pasta after we finally flagged her down again. 20 minutes later the table next to us got a huge pizza delivered to their table. After every other event that had passed ( spilled water on me, yelling at my husband for not knowing what his dish he ordered look like, etc...) I asked for the manager, he wouldn't come out so I confronted someone else about the pizza  and they basically insinuated there was no pizza on the floor and no one was eating pizza and that I was full of crap. They refused to fix any problems we had and didn't care about anything. No one would refill our drinks and she left every dish on the table from all 5 of us throughout dinner. No one would bus the table and every drink came in a new cup, there was no room anywhere after appetizers and the meals. IT WAS AWEFUL!! DON'T EVER VISIT THIS PLACE OR LAKE LAS VEGAS AND STAY AWAY FROM THE FEMALE WAITSTAFF AND THE BARTENDER WHO CALLS PEOPLE LIARS."}
{"text":"There Pizza was delicious, I thought it was a little pricey for 4 Pizzas with one topping we spent $70.00 The person that took our order, could not speak very good english, in fact he was rude. I would not recommend this place to eat at all. Find another restaurant in the Village."}
{"text":"Very nice... traveling with family, plenty of food.  Kids love pizza.  We loved the service, wines, and mainly the food. located in a picturistic town."}
{"text":"Lovely location overlooking the lake.  Flexible with last-minute reservations (and we were a party of 7).  Not ideal for small children.  Had to flag down the server multiple times (more water, ready to order, ready for the check)...The food wasn't bad, but overly priced.  The wine and dessert lists were both extensive.  But here's why I won't return: two antipasta plates were brought out by the server and as we did not order/ask for this, we assumed it was a complimentary offering.  When the bill arrived, we were charged $72 for the plates ($12 per adult), which we naturally disputed.  On top of the server not removing the antipasta from the bill, he refused to assist us by separating the bill into 4 checks (which in honesty wasn't something we asked for upfront, but hey, it happens).  With Lake Las Vegas' Village struggling the way it is, you'd think the businesses there would bend over backwards to bring their patrons back, especially the locals.  Long story short, I've got a bad taste in my mouth after this experience, and won't be recommending this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the kids and hubby after a morning of kayaking and stand up paddle boarding. We were starving and hot. We were worried it might be too fancy for the kids but it was perfect! Kids shared the spaghetti and the pizza and lasagna were amazing! Service was beyond great also! Can't wait until we go back!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, atmosphere is beautiful and the service fantastic. Did I say the food was awesome!!!!! We had the risotto pescatora( I'm butchering the language) knocchi spinach in bolganese sauce, spinach ravioli in a tomato sauce and a pepperoni pizza! Fantastic !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I go to Lake Las Vegas I like to eat dinner here or at their neighbors, Son Risa. Luna Rossa has such delicious homemade Italian food and their desserts, oh my god! I love the setting and their food. I especially love when the little old guy plays the accordion. It's so sweet and I love that little piece of Italy this place offers me."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Great food.  Alissandro was awesome...again !!  ...made the dinner fantastic.  He's super knowledgable and makes excellent recommendations ...you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Good food but misleading and you don't get what you're supposed to get and they don't take care of it they just let you live with it"}
{"text":"Gratuity20% for 2adults and 1kid, really!?!    I got bad experience at the #LunaRossa(yesterday) it wasn't good service, he's served and gone but he's charge me 20% of gratuity! I won't go back to this place."}
{"text":"Good food! Tiramisu and cannoli was perfect! Service was great and the ambience was delightful. Thanks Roberto! :)"}
{"text":"Recently experienced a Jazz night at the Lake Las Vegas and had a wonderful time. We found the setting to be quite romantic and picturesque. So my friend and I decided to go back there and try Luna Rossa. I ordered tuna carpaccio, it was fresh and tasty. To continue the seafood theme, I had pappardelle special with lobster and shrimp in saffron sauce...it was heavenly. Pasta was properly al dente with just the right touch of saffron. The most surprising and delightful element of our dinner was the manager, Alessandro's attentiveness. We asked him to recommend a wine to complement our meal. He recommended Jermann Chardonnay and we took his advice. And thank god, we took his words. The combination was perfect. We had a lot of questions regarding Italian wines and he patiently explained the beauty of each with passion. He was very attentive throughout our dinner though the place was busy with weekend tourists. When you have good food accompanied by excellent service, your dinner is elevated to another level. And that was the experience we had."}
{"text":"We were staying for one night at the Hilton village and found this place close to the hotel.  From the moment we stepped through the entrance we were made to feel like we weren't welcome.  The restaurant itself is well decorated and has an extensive menu.  Our waitress was rude and clearly we were an inconvenience.  It was decided for me that I wasn't having an appetiser and I would be sharing with my husband.  Everything was disjointed and since the table next to us had an overly attentive, bordering on creepy, waiter it made our experience much worse.  The food was distinctly average and nothing Italian about it having actually eaten in Italy many times.   We couldn't wait to get out of there.  My advice would be not to bother with this place unless you like rude unhelpful staff and average food."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for menu and water. Didn't help it was 100 degrees outside.  Anytime the server was at our table, he never looked at us once. He was always looking around at passerby's. Took our wine list away before we even looked at it, then asked if we wanted drinks. I politely told him he took our drink menu away so we never had a chance to look at it. It was very obvious he would be very quick to get an attitude in any situation. Plus, it was Mother's day and it wasn't a very pleasant customer experience. But customer service is huge and they easily failed at that. The food was not very good. Caprese salad was just \"ok\" and the calamari was HORRIBLE!!! Bland and overly chewy. No flavor. No one thanked us for dining or wished happy mothers day as we walked out. Not a very pleasant experience. We DEFINITELY won't be returning. Their name shouldn't be Luna Rossa.....it should be Luna Grossa."}
{"text":"A must if in Lake Las Vegas, good quality Italian food, authentic, which is not easy to find!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day a bit windy,after a walk around the beautiful 'PROMENADE\" we decided to eat something . My husband and I ,we are both Italians..The restaurant was not very busy . They had two table of two outside ,two couples ,one group of seven people,and one table with a party of four inside . The manager or owner with a blue shirt  ,let us pick the table. The restaurant is lovely ,small ,but still very nice. Waiting staff are all hispanic and they make loud  comments on the guy(in the blue shirt)  and call him \" the old man\" in their own language(not very respectfull in front of everybody )when he is busy outside.. I think actually even if he was a little fast asking questions and keept walking not listenig  much of our answers..was the only one taking care of our table.  We order two pizzas,sorry to say not very good..the  dishes they served at the table next to us they did not look specials either..sorry.  If you  are enjoing  the lake view, watch for the busser ,he'll get your plate even if you are still eating.."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place a solid three and a half. But, I can't- and hey, if you aren't expecting the absolute best Italian food out there but need something to lean on, then this place is for you.   It was relatively busy when we walked in, but there were still some tables open and we were seated relatively quickly. Bread and olive oil came promptly. The service was good, and our server was very nice. We actually talked a little bit when dinner was over. His service alone made me round this review up to four stars.  Onto the food. I ordered the Gnocchi Sorrentina, which is gnocchi in a tomato basil sauce with pieces of fresh mozzarella. My mom originally ordered a salad, but the server was kind enough to let her change her order shortly thereafter to a pasta dish with penne, chicken, and broccoli in a light cream sauce. My dad got a salad with salmon, my brother a pasta dish with bolognese sauce.   The food was good, typical Italian. The sauce on my gnocchi was exceptionally good, along with my mom's cream sauce. I didn't taste the other two dishes, but I heard good things. Portions were perfect- not too big, nor too small. We had Creme Brûlée for dessert, a perfectly sized Creme Brûlée that was tasty. Overall, it was a good experience. Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"The mushroom risotto was wonderful. It was rich and earthly. Best risotto I have ever had. The gnocchi was very tender and fluffy."}
{"text":"Not equipped to handle more than a few customers at a time. Rude and inefficient. Don't know the definition of customer service. Would never eat there again and definitely would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"OK- I hate to write a negative review, especially at a place I've only dined once. Maybe they were having an off day. Maybe their chef died and they brought the janitor to fill in (no disrespect to janitors!). I don't know what happened, but I do know that it was one of the worst meals I've ever had! My friend and I both had panini sandwiches; his was sausage and peppers, mine was chicken with some sort of cheese. The sausage wasn't great, the peppers almost tasteless, and neither sandwich was made on a panini press. Someone took an Italian roll (not a very tasty one either) put grill marks on the top and stuffed the appropriate filling inside. Not a panini!! The sandwiches gave new meaning to dry and tasteless.  But what really makes me write this review is the so called tortellini soup. Just looking at it, I knew it wasn't soup. The broth was a translucent gray with green stuff floating in it. I was being served tortellini pasta water with pesto dropped on top! The people involved in this restaurant should truly be ashamed to serve this so called food. The restaurant is in a nice place- get someone who can cook a decent meal, preferably, someone with taste buds."}
{"text":"Terrible food & terrible service.  The lasagna tasted like chef boy r Dee from a can.  Very pricey menu"}
{"text":"Heavenly!!! The food was so fresh, flavorful and authentic tasting. The service was great.  The overall feel of this restaurant was just perfect. Love love loved it!"}
{"text":"Had an event at the Ravella with my company and had a free night, so I decided I'd try out Luna Rossa.   I had the penne with chicken and broccoli and my colleague had the ziti with vodka sauce. Both were delicious. Also a big thing for me at restaurants is the bread and it was fantastic, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Would give it five stars but the server ignored us for quite a while until he came to get our credit card, then he laid it on thick, obviously hoping for a big tip. He did give us a each a free glass of dessert wine, which was nice."}
{"text":"Worst service we've experienced in a very long time.   Had dinner here with my wife on Friday night.  We were seated immediately but our server didn't make his first appearance until 15 - 20 min in. We were hungry with an early start the next day so we stayed.   He was extremely rude, seemed to be in a rush....cutting us off in the middle our order and walking off, returning  impatient as ever, carelessly threw our dishes onto the table, slamming them into each other. Only after our disgusted looks did he finally calm down and the service began to improve slightly.  The only thing saving this review from a 1 star was the food .  We got the gnocchi fritta appetizer, spaghetti and meatballs, penne pasta with a cream sauce and broccoli with chicken (sorry don't remember the exact name and couldn't find it in the online menu).  Favorite dish was the pasta w cream sauce. Sauce was creamy and delicious. All the pasta was cooked to perfection. Least favorite was the gnocchi fritta...was very good but not as good as the other dishes.   Food was great but I'll never eat here again because of our experience with the server."}
{"text":"This is a new location from the same owners of the Luna Rossa at Lake Las Vegas.  I have never been to the original location but had a TERRIBLE experience today at the Downtown/Fremont Street location. I went with two other people and we ordered the meatball sandwich, filet mignon sandwich and lasagna.  Lasagna and meatball sandwich were both cold and flavorless.  Am assuming that this was previously frozen and microwaved before it was served to us.  Also, the water glasses and silverware were very dirty. We were very shocked when we received our bill... All items that were ordered were supposed to be part of the lunch menu and were supposed to include drinks.  We were charged $3.75 each for our sodas and by that point we all just wanted out of the restaurant. It was really expensive for a previously frozen, microwaved lunch.  The only good part was the Krispy Kreme donuts that we stopped for on our way back to work."}
{"text":"I would really give this a 4.5. We started with a calamari appetizer...just okay but sauce was good. My entree was a special of the day Mushroom Ravioli which was to die for! Big portions and the sauce was heavenly. Another special was Chicken Saltimbocca but my husband asked to substitute veal and they did it! He says the veal was done right, extremely tender, and sauce was excellent. We asked for decaf coffee--no dessert because we were too full--and it did seem that it might have been freeze dried rather than brewed. Our service was great and they were very nice even though we both were not dressed up (it was a Sunday night). I highly recommend this restaurant and will return!!"}
{"text":"Our organization paid $26 per person to hold our banquet here. They expected us to share food barely enough for 2 people among 7 people. We had to ration and was starving in the end."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night during a staycation with the bf at Lake Las Vegas. There are a small amount of restaurants, but there's variety. We decided on Italian and ended up here at Luna Rossa. The location of the restaurant is lovely, very close to the lake, providing a great view from their patio. I also really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere.  I would give the food about a 3.5. The standard bread starter was...standard. Our calamari appetizer had a very nicely seasoned, crispy breading. The bf's spaghetti and clams came in a flavorful white wine broth. I went with the spaghetti and lobster, which I was kind of hesitant about because I don't like gambling on the amount of lobster that comes in the dish. Luna Rossa did not disappoint! There was a whole lobster tail full of meat, and the shell was used in the plating. Each bite of pasta was accompanied by a buttery chunk of lobster tail. Mmmm. For dessert, we had Lavazza coffee, creme brulee and cannoli. All were decent.  I decided to bump up the rating for the great service we got, especially our server, who turned out to be the owner. We did not know he was the owner until the end of our dinner. There was some miscommunication and he thought we needed a hotel room at Ravella. He offered to make a call to get us a special low rate. Too bad, we already had a room.  I like to help out family owned businesses. His family also owns the Black Pepper Grill also in the village. And yes, this is the same Black Pepper Grill that used to be on Eastern. So if you find yourself at Lake Las Vegas and are in the mood for Italian, Luna Rossa would be a fine choice."}
{"text":"Best of the best!!  Our group of 6 'mature foodies' from New England dined at Luna Rossa.  We unanimously agree that the food & service was some of the best we've  enjoyed, ever.  Our server, Alexandro, was exceptional! He memorized our 6 orders for drinks, apps & entrees, including dietary restrictions for a few in our group, with changes being made to a few of our orders.  We were quite impressed when every order arrived exactly as ordered!!   Being our first visit to Luna Rossa, we asked Alexandro to surprise us with appetizers of his choosing.  Alexandro didn't disappoint as the apps he chose for us were amazing!  We enjoyed platters of thickly sliced fresh tomatoes & mozzarella topped w/basil & balsamic vinegar; lightly fried calamari w/a wonderful spicy marinara; and finally shaved prosuitto w/mozzarella.  Everything was fresh, delicious and perfectly seasoned. Our entrees varied...gluten free pasta w/meatballs & bolognese sauce; chicken parmigiana; seafood blend over pasta; and veal parmigiana.  Every entree was perfectly cooked, seasoned and prepared to our individual specifications....throughout our meal we each expressed our delight and that our meals were some of the best Italian food we've ever had...from the East coast to the West coast!! We're returning tonight to try their pizzas, which looked & smelled fantastic as servers passed our tables with pizza & we watched stacks of pizza being picked up for take out. Visit Luna Rossa in the Lake Las Vegas in Henderson, NV.   Thank you again to Alexandro for such an amazing dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian cuisine, owned by an Italian family.   Service was a little awkward since everyone spoke Italian more fluently than English but overall still a very pleasant experience.   Linguine & clams was the best serving of this dish I have ever had!!! No complaints over the portion of clams served with the pasta. Super generous & there were smaller clams in the light wine sauce. SUPERB!!!  The bf ordered rigatoni with bolognese and ate every last bit of it!!!  Not a lot of options for food in this village but we would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has a high rating here in Yelp. I went here with colleagues for dinner on a Wednesday night and the place was practically empty but they put us in a corner near the toilet.  I'm not sure why but since we were all quite hungry, I didn't want to make a fuzz so we can just sit and eat. For starters, we had the Caprese which was ok -- it is difficult to mess up sliced mozzarella and tomatoes with basil.  For the main course, I had the grilled lamb chops with rosemary garlic white wine sauce.  The lamb was overcooked and tough and not seasoned well.  I shared my dish with my friend so she shared her Grilled Salmon with the 8-yr old balsamic vinegar.  The balsamic vinegar was great but the salmon was also overcooked, dry and not seasoned well!   Our server was ok but he was talking to us like we didn't know a single thing about Italian food.  Well maybe he was just being proactive explaining each and every item in the menu. The only reason I put two stars instead of 1 is because of the desserts.  They had a chocolate bomb which was hazel nut ice cream covered in a chocolate shell.  All my friends ordered their own ice cream and all were good specially the pina colada one."}
{"text":"ALDO gave great service. Had the lobster ravioli/shrimp in pink sauce- really good. Husband had Homemade pasta was really good also. Us and the kids loved the dessert ALDO brought out- truffle ice cream. 4 stars bc it was a little pricey- but you can get 10% off with check in"}
{"text":"As a person who loves Downtown, but has yet to discover all the delicious wonders it has strewn throughout, I enjoyed this new place. One, I love the name. \"Red Moon\" is something that catches my attention right off the bat. They have a little bar at the front and the dining area is pretty big, but not too big. You need a code to get into the restrooms, which I find very safe. Downtown folks and bathrooms can get a little crazy sometimes, so I appreciate the thought from the owner(s).   As for the food, quite delicious. We had their Capri salad, lasagna, Margarita pizza, and just a simple sausage and pepperoni pizza. All that was perfect for four of us. The Margarita pizza was my favorite. The lasagna was pretty darn good too, but I have had better.   The only thing that was not perfect, though he was very very nice, was the inattentiveness of the waiter. It took him awhile to realize we needed more drinks and to come check in on us.   Other than that, everything was very nice and delicious!"}
{"text":"Ate here over the weekend while staying in lake Las Vegas. Food was very good. Had the gnochetti for an appetizer and then shared pizza and lasagna. I could have eaten 2 orders of the gnochetti it was so good. The pizza had a very thin crust and was very tasty. As for the lasagna I am very picky and I try it in many places and outside of Italy this was some of the best I've had. Will definitely be going back here next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place was hugely underwhelming. It was very expensive (almost nothing under $20). The food was good, but the service was snooty."}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying at the Hilton and wandered around the village and stumbled across this restaurant, and I am so glad we did!    For dinner my beau and I split an order of fettuccine alfredo, we asked them to include chicken which they were very happy to oblige, but alas, upon receiving it, there was no chicken *sad face*.  Sans chicken it was still delicious, the sauce was so creamy and rich, but not too rich, just right!  Another friend of mine ordered a pepperoni pizza, and to the surprise of everyone, it was incredible!  The one who ordered it even claimed it to be the best pizza he has ever had, and he is a (self proclaimed) pizza aficionado!    For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which was to die for.  Another couple ordered the strawberry tiramisu which they thoroughly enjoyed, and my other friend ordered the cannoli and had zero complaints.    The staff was very friendly and accommodating (even if they forgot my chicken).  My only complaint is that our waiter was very slow to move along the process.  He would bring something out and would take forever to come back again.  Especially once we were done with the dinner, the dessert menu and ordering took a lifetime, as did signing the check.  Even though the meal dragged out, the good company I was surrounded by and the delicious food made the night perfect!  If I am ever back in town, I will be hitting that place up for dinner... or at least dessert!"}
{"text":"The italian food is great but a bit overpriced!  The servers are really awkward it seems they warm up to the locals.  Nice atmosphere roght on the lake.  Try the truffle pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was even better. The fried zucchini arrived in French fry size bites and was so good we ordered more. The lobster ravioli was 5 stars per the kids and the filet and lobster was perfect.   If you are around lake Las Vegas check this place out it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic food and great atmosphere. Our waiter Aldo was friendly and knowledgeable, very friendly. We will come back to this location."}
{"text":"This place was great. My husband was not feeling well so we ended up ordering to go. They were very nice about it and although they forgot one of our salads they made up for it with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Loved the setting, came out to Lake Las Vegas for a race and arrived late Friday and they were still open. There was live music playing at the Lake which killed the mood a tad but wasn't so bad.   Checked the menu posted out front, walked in, took a few minutes to be helped. Everyone working seemed to be appalled I showed up on my own. Oops?  ordered the PENNE AL POLLO E POMODORO, didn't get bread until my food came out. Bread was great, pasta was average. Left right away. Don't know if I'd come back to this restaurant again in particular but just enjoy the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian fare. Great staff, attentive to our every need. Nice ambiance, with a very good guitarist."}
{"text":"This is a newer establishment in downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street. The whole downtown experience was quite new to me as I'm usually a stay-on-the-strip kind of guy. However, this area is quite interesting and a lot more popular than I thought. Needless to say, things are more affordable around here.   As for this Italian restaurant, it's a pretty good size restaurant. I came here during lunch and had a pleasant experience. Don't expect a quiet romantic setting as this restaurant is on the busiest street downtown, but that goes without saying. It's more of an upbeat, festive environment. The food was a pleasant surprise, I had the Seafood Risotto and the NY Steak. For dessert I had the Tiramisu and the Creme Brulee. I really recommend the Tiramisu, it was delicious.   Overall, I had a great experience and I would come back if I was in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Finally!!! An Italian restaurant worth raving about that is excellent in food and price.   My husband had been here before, last spring with my mother-in-law (who's Italian, born and raised in Italy). She enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, and the conversation with the waiter who was also Italian. My hubby finally had a chance today to take me there and it was worth it.   1. Food- I had the penne alle vodka w/. shrimp. It was amazing! The pasta cooked perfectly and same with the shrimp. The sauce was flavorful and not too heavy for a 90 degree day. My hubby had the linguine with shrimp and tomatoes. It was delicious as well and light. The bread was served warm and was yummy.   2. Portions- Portions were perfect size. Not too big where you need a doggie bag but not too small where you are still hungry. I walked away with enough room for a scoop of gelati across the street (Tutti Gelati is as close to authentic gelati as I have tasted since moving to LV other than Espressamente illy at the Palazzo).   3. Cappucino- this may sound silly but the way you can tell a good cappucino is by the foam. When you pour your sugar on it, and it doesn't collapse, that is a sign of a good cup. And my cappucino was yummy. Made with LavAzza, a brand I use myself and used alot in Italy (along with illy brand).   4. Ambiance- it was great. We sat outside on the patio under the shade and enjoyed the view of the lake. Our waiter was very nice and we later discovered from outside of Roma. I wonder if he's the same person from last spring.   5. Price- Just right for quality Italian food. Lunch for two (plus the cappucino and a bottle aqua frizzante), it came to $40 excluding tip. This to me is pretty good considering everything.   I highly recommend people go to this restaurant as well as the Lake. Granted it was a 25/30 minute drive for us but we will definitely be back. Can't believe this place was kept from me for so long!"}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone else about this place.....the tourists will spoil it. Okay, so it's on Freemont, but the owners AND the chef are original Italian's from the old country. Great food, great value. Manager, Chris, knows his stuff and will liaise with the chef if you need a tweak on your meal. We now go here everytime we are in Vegas. They even remembered us from our last visit. Had live music, a duo. wasn't Italian though...that would have been the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Well. We have frequented luna rosa on numerous occasions. Our favorite waiter, Allassandro is most accommodating, customer oriented, and provides value added service. His friendliness, and attention to detail, will amaze you. The food is always prepared to our liking, appealing to the eye, and presented as gormet dining.  We really enjoy the enthusiasm Allassandro demonstrates while  he opens a bottle of wine.  Allassandro is always professional. We always leave feeling like we were treated special. To the chef, Thank you. To  luna rosa, thank you for wonderful dining. And Allassandro, thank you, for making our dinners always so pleasant."}
{"text":"I order take from menu posted online and was charged totally different prices, nearly double  Also changed for different items than I ordered 32 for veal parmigiana  22 for a 14 in pizza"}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service... table for 4 ... 2 out 5 dishes sent back and the \"manager\" rude to paying customers. This place is a joke. Avoid."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for its patio seating, especially when it's nice outside. It has been a great place for a large group as well as an intimate setting with my husband.   I'll be honest, I have experienced a bit longer wait times when they're busy and if the patio or restaurant is full, it seems as if the tables are a bit close together. Nothing where you're on top of each other listening to each other's conversations, though.  Most importantly, we have had good service and the food is memorably delicious. I wish I had photos to add from both experiences!"}
{"text":"We have been here so many times and never had a bad experience. Located at the village at lake Las Vegas, it has a very European charmThe food is always delicious, the servers always friendly and efficient. Ortolana sala, grocchetti fritti, calamari, pizza, pasta with chicken and broccoli are some of my favorite dishes. Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch and pleasantly surprised with probably one of the best pizza's we've enjoyed since moving to Las Vegas over 10 years ago!  Thank you Giovanni, your service was awesome!  We will be back for more!  #lakelasvegas #lunarossa"}
{"text":"Awful. Cold food both times i went here and management that does not care.  when paying top dollar you have to get it right."}
{"text":"We were with a pretty large group and our server was incredibly rude and impatient the whole time. We made reservations nearly a week in advance and they sat us all in a corner as if they didn't have space for us. Extremely over priced for what we got. ):"}
{"text":"The food was good fiancé and I went their for a nice night out and the service was pretty bad, I was almost done with my dinner before they have me a refill on my soda."}
{"text":"Wow a lot of people out there seem to really like this place. On the other hand, I though my meal there was horrible.  Me and a group of friends were staying at a hotel across the lake for a friends' wedding and wanted to get some food the night before the wedding.   I got the spaghetti pescatora and my friends got the paghetti and meatballs, risotto al funghi, and salamone allacento balsamico. All of the above were plain bad (I've been to Italy 3 times and I know what good Italian food tastes like).  Although I doubt I'll ever have a reason to return to the hotel resort, if I do I certaily stay away from Luna Rossa!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friends on a Friday night, and it was GREAT!!! The food is SOOOO yummy! Their fettucini with pink vodca sauce is wonderful, the salad is awesome, the prosciutto crostini was UNBELIEVABLE, sooo good I can't describe! We are definitely going back there. Price is very good.   Not ok -  they kept the doors opened so it was kinda hot inside but the food made up for it!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the entrance - the pizza shop downstairs is starkly different than the restaurant upstairs.  Small, but very inviting room. Food was fantastic. Lobster Ravioli was one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my service today. I came in today with my little Chihuahua and she was inside her own tote bag, she's my service dog and we where treated extremely well. I forgot the name of the individual who served us, but I do remember his the boss there. I want to thank you for your outstanding service today. Your great food recommendation and your attention to detail. I will be back again and hopefully I can bring my family when they visit me. Try the Italian Chardonnay and the prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer it's a great starter."}
{"text":"They have a great toasted mozzarella appetizer that should not be missed. True Italians running it with authentic pasta. Pretty casual, so good for families."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great. Love the patio overlooking the lake. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Our evening at Luna Rossa was a disappointment.  The waiter was testy from the beginning.  The food was good, but the staff seemed to have a very bad attitude.  Our waiter was the second rudest waiter we have ever had, anywhere."}
{"text":"My best friend recommended this restaurant before we left for our conference here in Las Vegas. Once here I went on Yelp to find it and began to read the reviews, some of which were not favorable, but in the end we decided to go anyway even though it was a 15 minute drive. I will tell you it was well worth it.   Luna Rossa, which means red moon in Italian, is a lovely restaurant overlooking Lake Las Vegas. This is a great location on a street of shops, bars and restaurants that almost make you feel you are in Disney property. You can eat outside on their patio (with outdoor heaters if the air is chilly) or in a more romantic setting inside. In either location you are looking at water in the middle of a dessert!  It was a Saturday night around 9pm. We were seated right away by a friendly smiling staff. We had immediate service and were handed an extensive wine list and full menu. The waiter was adorable with his Italian accent and explained the specials in detail. We ordered a bottle of Banfi Classico Chianti reasonably priced at $44.00 and a prosciutto fresh mozzarella appetizer for $15.00. Delicious crusty rustic Italian bread arrived with oil and vinegar. I love this earthy bread that is a staple in Italy. Quite soon after our appetizer arrived along with the wine. The prosciutto was tasty and not to salty, and the fresh mozarella balls offset this spiced ham perfectly.  We now ordered the rest of our meal. We decided to share a Caesar salad, I chose the Manicotti with Spinach and Ricotta filling, my husband chose a special which was a Rigatoni with a truffled cream sauce and sautéed filet mignon cut and incorporated into the meal. Our salad came right away, simple and perfectly balanced with the right hint of anchovie in the dressing, yet not over powering. It was also the correct amount of dressing, my lettuce was not swimming, and the shaved Parmesan cheese was not used sparingly. There was enough cheese for just about every bite.  Again, without any wait, our dinners arrived. My manicotti was so good, I woke up the next day still dreaming about it. The sauce was a fresh tomato marinara with the perfect hint of garlic. The filling delicious, with an added bonus of a small side of perfectly crisp sautéed vegetables with a few breaded crisped quartered potatoes tucked in the corner. My husband was kind enough to share a few bites if his al dente (firm and to the tooth as a pasta should be) rigatoni and I was again so pleased to see that the truffle oil was not overpowering the delicious homemade cream sauce (as so many chefs are want to do.)  We both finished our meals with nothing left to bring home. We had no room for dessert as a result, yet compromised by ordering cuppachino. Two perfectly sized cups with stiff foam arrived sprinkled with cinnamon, instead of the oversized lattes I usually receive at other restaurants.  I whole heartedly recommend this restaurant. On the night we went, it was indeed perfect! Our bill came to $129.00."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! I loved it! I should of taken a picture. It was delicious!!! Papperdelle lobster in spicy marinara sauce it was soon good!!!!!  If your near by check this place out! Solo good!!!"}
{"text":"Best food great service good prices friendly atmosphere, just wish they still had the grand piano here"}
{"text":"I had the ribeye and my wife had some sort of unpronounceable dish that looked like tortellini. Both were incredible. The food came out in less than 15 minutes and was cooked perfectly. Then to cap off our delicious meal, our fantastic waiter Alessandro gave us a free tirimisu to make up for the loud table nearby, even though they weren't really bothering us. All in all great service and great food."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and sadly it is never busy. Today, was no exception; there was a total of two tables, one was ours.  So one would think that the service would be phenomenal.  Lunch too two hours. Our appetizers came as lunch was being served. I had the Ahi Tuna Special. It was special alright...cooked well done. I may as well had tuna from a can. At least dessert was good. Rarely have I had someone mess up something pre-made. I really wish the service  (and food) was better,  this place has so much potential."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant last year while our stay in Lake Las Vegas & made sure we made a reservation to come back this year! We love the pasta & my boyfriend especially enjoys the pink vodka sauce!  He isn't much of an Italian cuisine fan but this restaurant is his only exception..decided to make it a tradition for his birthday.   It has a beautiful lake side view, out-door dinning with florescent lights..inside restaurant can get a little crowded due to size. This last dinning experience, im a little disappointed. Service wasn't as expected, did not greet us when we walked thru door. Made a reservation which we mentioned it was for a birthday, and would like a dessert since we were celebrating a special occasion. Not sure if they caught that we had a reservation but i did mention it when they seated us but they failed to do the request. They don't seem very attentive to reservations and requests. Didn't receive the dessert, i guess i was afraid to mention it since the waiter hovered over me during my meal.. instead we grabbed dessert next door at Rocky Mountain Chocolate store. Nonetheless, food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this will be the last time we eat here. We are residents and frequented this establishment quite a few times. The food undoubtedly is very good and authentic. However, I cannot say the same about the staff. We went there this past Saturday evening expecting a wait. It was a beautiful evening and diners were eating outside. When we arrived there was maybe two couples outside the door and a diner with his dog apparently waiting to be seated. There was a large sign at the door saying to come in and check with a hostess. We proceeded to do this and waited at the hostess stand, we were the first in line. Two servers said they would be right back and for us to wait. After five minutes a server comes up to us and rudely tells us to go back outside that the seating was first come first serve.  Both the patron behind me and myself said that we were following what the sign said outside. His response to me was \"señora please outside, whoever comes first gets seated first\". Let me mention that there were plenty of tables inside to be seated at. Both my husband and I as well as the people behind us left.   There is a way to speak to your patrons and I was very angry at his attitude. Perhaps they were shorthanded but this was not appropriate. Because of this we will no longer eat at this establishment. As I mentioned, the food is pricey but good. They need to work on their customer service and hire friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Just about the worst dining experience I've ever had. Walking in, just my mom and I, 3 different waiters came up to us and tried to sit us when the first waiter was already in the process of trying to sit us. We were then sat outside near the gate and our table rocked and it hurt to sit in the chair. Our waitress kept referring to us as Lady. \"Do you want water Lady?\" Didn't sound good. Nobody explained anything on the menu. Once we ordered, my spaghetti was ok, but my mom's parm w eggplant was inedible and looked old. We placed the plate on the edge of the table to show that we were not about to eat it, about 3 waiters and even our own waitress looked at us and the plate many times but then kept walking away. 10 mins later she came to us and said how is everything. When we finally got a chance to tell her about the food, she looked at us weird and said ok...it was awkward. We just decided to leave. I tried to talk to the manager and they all kept saying he's really busy n what not. I waited for 5 mins before I finally gave up and left. It was ridiculous. I stayed mad for like the whole rest of the night. That was My experience."}
{"text":"This has a nice setting and great service, food is ok, but its way over priced and small servings."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but the server looked like he wanted to shank us! I had the Caprese Pizza and my boyfriend had the Cannelloni. Both were delicious! The pizza was huge so most of it came home with us. I would go back again despite the server hating us for no reason! :-)"}
{"text":"Exquisite! Dined for lunch on a Monday. The Village at Lake Las Vegas was a bit lonely but Luna Rossa had several tables filled with jolly guests. That was my first clue we had selected the right venue. I selected from one of the many board specials. It was hard to only pick one. The pumpkin ravioli in sage butter with fresh parmesan surpassed my expectations. It was brilliant. As did the minestrone. I don't even like minestrone soup. I ordered it to warm up, as it was brisk outside. It was so chocked full of veggies and flavor, I am now a fan. My companions enjoyed their luncheon salads too. The grilled chicken caesar salad was nice and the caprese salad featured thick slabs of best quality fresh mozzarella. The neighboring tables had pizza which appeared delicious. Service was excellent. Presentation superb. Atmosphere lovely. Room with a view. We will return. $$"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food.   I got the petto di pollo ai funghi and it was very light and delicious! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible, service! Did I mention TERRIBLE service! Wow!! We waited 2.5 hours for our food and were there having dinner a total of 4 hours!!!! 4 hours I kid you not for dinner?!?!   Asked the server for bread perhaps 4 times, he kept walking by the table and ignoring us, never brought the bread and when I finally reminded him he came back and said the kitchen wasn't making any more bread?? Seriously?!?!  Legitimately the worst experience I have ever had in my life. The food was super overpriced, --which I wouldn't have minded paying for, had the service even been mediocre.   My husband's chicken parmesan didn't even come with pasta or any side, besides some measly boiled vegetables and was slathered in breading. Nobody working there even spoke Italian. Will never return. Worst experience of my life!"}
{"text":"My main dish was fantastic, the pappardelle with shrimp definitely made one of my top five pasta dishes of all time. The calamari, however was one of the worst. Chewy, bland, lacking charisma and the marinara was salty and too tangy. The service was lacking. I'd expect top notch for restaurants that charge $30-$40 a plate. Our server didn't tell us her name, didn't let us know of any specials (we had to overhear them from the server talking to the next table), nor did she offer or suggest any wine. But with all that being said, I'd still come back for the delicious homemade pastas."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Luna Rossa if you like Italian food.  Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, and best of all.....Delicious Food!"}
{"text":"The Good: Well as others have said, the pizza is pretty good and we had a fairly attentive wait staff.  All of our food was pretty good.  The Bad: The Prices! This is priced like a very upscale restaurant, I definitely had a bit of sticker shock.  I found it offensive to have entrees this price that are being served on white paper sheets instead of white table cloth.  Will I go back?  I probably will not return for the sit down experience again.  Really just too pricey for what we got... I may get some pizza again through the window though."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal there today. Fabulous meal from the salad to dessert! Lasagna, rigatoni, sorbet, cannoli and cappuccino, we enjoyed it all. The atmosphere was relaxing. The service wonderful! We're home! Thanks Giovanni."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! All the other tables that got seated after us got their food and Diego the waiter treated us soo bad. After over an hour we finally left still hungry! The cook yelled at us as we left\"Go to Taco Bell\". Never again, save your money and time!"}
{"text":"We actually wanted to go to Pizzamania next door. The open sign was on but door was locked so we called the telephone number listed on Yelp and it rang through here at Luna Rossa. We were told to come here to the restaurant and the gentleman let us order what we wanted at the Pizza place (fried calamari and meatball sub) and said he would match the price and he did The sub was okay but I loved the fried calamari. The restaurant is very nice with linens on the table, modern colorful light fixtures, and nice Italian music playing."}
{"text":"Pretty hard to beat no matter what city you're in. Great outdoor seating, setting and service. On top of all that, the food is fantastic! Any negative review on this place are highly suspect with questional motives. Five stars and would give it six if I could."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a little difficult to find, since it is down at the bottom of a pedestrian mall. It is also one of the few businesses still open in the pedestrian mall - it's a little weird walking through the area. Even the Casino is closed with chains on the doors. When I got to the restaurant it was jumping! Nice staff, food was an B+ to A-. Pretty good but not amazing. I would go here again, though."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Not a place for kids. The waiters/hosts are not welcoming towards kids. Kinda ironic since it's in a tourist spot. They kinda think they're at chic bistro in Milan, maybe they're trying to forget they're actually in a cement oven in the Vegas desert.   One star for decent food (a notch above maggianos). One star for the view.  Will not return."}
{"text":"verything was really good...except the New York strip was not cooked to temp!!!!! OMG that's the worst.....the waiter was arrogant.....so there you go.....my salad was delicious"}
{"text":"Lovely location in the Village at Lake Las Vegas, currently with a view of the kids and tweens enjoying Ice Skating on The Lake (which lasts thru Valentine's Day). One star for location.  Patio dining is wonderful, weather permitting, and on this Sunday before MLK Day, the weather was terrific. So another star for the lovely patio where smoking is allowed ... Thank you Luna Rossa.  Unfortunately, we ordered from their Sunday Brunch menu ... which is apparently NOT where this kitchen shines.  We shared a plate of pancakes (no sugar-free syrup - booooo), which were thin, dense and had a pasty consistency.  We also each ordered an omelet ... I had the Italiano with Italian sausage, mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce.  Again, the term \"light and fluffy\" proved not to be in the chef's vocabulary.    My omelet was overcooked and dense, no fluffiness in sight. No evidence of mozzarella either ... I think it may have been mixed in with the eggs, but this cheese addict was looking forward to stretchy, gooey delicious cheese snuggled amongst the sausage ... but sadly, it was not to be. Topped with only about 2 tablespoons of marinara (which was yummy), so I had to ask for more and when we checked on its ETA, was told they had to heat it up.  Really?  An Italian restaurant that doesn't have a bubbling pot of marinara on the stove 24/7?  Very odd.  My date had the Lago Omelette (ham, swiss, mushrooms), which looked overcooked to me, but he said it was good. The \"hash browns\" served with our omelets appeared to be those frozen squares purchased at Smith's. Blecchhh!  Toast arrived cold and sans butter. I am always a little bummed out when I get cold toast on which butter will not melt. It is just so much less appetizing to eat cold dry bread with butter that just sits on top mocking me with every bite. Icky.  No stars for the Sunday Brunch, but I will award a final star for the amazing Lavazza coffee served.  The mimosa that came with brunch and the Lavazza coffee at the end, were the best parts of this meal.    Service was just okay. Didn't impress or annoy to any degree.  I may give Luna Rossa another chance to wow me with their regular menu ... but I cannot recommend this place as an option for Sunday Brunch.  C-"}
{"text":"Very good food but expensive for what it was! I guess that is the price for Lake Las Vegas! I was invited here by some friends for dinner and even though the food was good I was less than impressed by the service we received!   Our server was very rude, he keeps walking away before we finished talking and it was very frustrating! Not sure if he was busy or did not want to serve us but he was annoyed and it was very obvious! He took my order my pointing at me... that's it! Pointed at me in a \"what you want\" manner. What kind of service is this? He also never came back to check on us once the food was delivered!   We got calamari which was very good, I ordered peen with chicken and broccoli which was $22, it was good but expensive for a very basic dish! The rest of my party seems to enjoyed their food.   Other staff were very friendly and treated us better than our own server! The bus person constantly re-filled our drinks and picked up our dirty plates.   A very meh place for me...I wouldn't make the drive just to eat here."}
{"text":"First off, the food here is phenomenal. Very good and decent sized portions as well as nice pacing as you would get in a European restaurant.  Our party went on New Year's Eve and had reservations booked for several weeks. Nothing on their website nor when they called to confirm said anything about an altered special menu for the night so some in our party were disappointed since popular items on regular menu were not offered. They need to be better at communicating changes like that and setting expectations. We overheard others surprised by this and upset as well.  They should probably take out one table and rearrange to be sure decent space between tables. It's very crowded and requires severs and other guests to squeeze by as you're trying to eat and enjoy things at your own table. Otherwise ambience is nice and on weekends they have nice mellow live music played.  Overall 4 Star mostly for the food and overall serving/pacing experience but they need to be a bit more on the ball with some details and making changes clear."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic and deserves way more than its current rating. To start, my dad and I ordered Calamari and Bruschetta - both were delicious. For my entree, I got the Strozza Preti Con Pomodoroni E Gamberi. My dad got the Linguine Pescatora. We both thought our meals were outstanding. The shrimp on my pasta was delicious and very tasty. The service was also very quick and we will definitely be back next time we are in Lake Las Vegas! P.S. Make sure you use the Yelp coupon here for 20% off the bill!"}
{"text":"Came here back in January for my wedding anniversary, my husband and I wanted to get away from the busy city and we loved every moment of it, came in and the staff was very friendly and helpful, it was a late Saturday night so there weren't many customers which was great, they had candles lit all over and there was someone playing the piano, I had the chicken and broccoli pasta with sun dried tomatoes, my husband had the lobster ravioli, both were quite appetizing, we had a wonderful experience and we hope we have the same experience this upcoming anniversary, we even went ice skating before we ended the night!"}
{"text":"Charged 25$ for a 14\" half cheese half pepperoni pizza even though their online menu lists the price as 14$. Staff refused to honor the online price.  Pizza was only worth 9.99$ at most."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and even better martinis! If you're looking for a date night I would highly recommend this cute Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"EDIT: as I was finishing my review I noticed the restaurant offers 20% using the Yelp app if I would have seen that I would have certainly not had issues with the prices.  Overall the food was good but shy of spectacular, the service was decent and I found the prices on the higher side but the portions are certainly large. Some of the details: We were staying at one of the resort by lake Las Vegas and decided to stay around the lake for dinner. We read the mixed reviews and wasn't sure what to expect but decided to go Italian instead of French although the French bistro had better ratings. The hostess was welcoming and our server was pleasant. He wasn't too wordy but I certainly didn't mind it at all but some people used to more attentive service might not appreciate it. I would maybe describe it service with a European flair or lack of it. We ordered a glass of wine, a glass of beer, sparkling water, one of the specials - fettuccine with meat sauce - and a sausage pizza. The rose was quite approachable and good but not spectacular (FYI - it is listed under whites). My pizza was quite large, easily shareable at least 20 inches if not larger. The sausage had a nice hint of fennel and the pizza dough could have been a bit saltier but overall pretty good. I'm still deciding if it was worth $24 but not bad at all. The whole wheat fettuccini was a bit thick for my taste but the meat sauce was quite good and needed a little something to make it great. Again the portion was quite big and my partner could not finish it. We also got a basket of bread with baguette slices and (I assume) focaccia but I didn't try it since I was told something weird was going on with it. Finally the bill came to $88 for two for food and a drink each. Overall that's not bad especially if we consider the amount of food served but I feel some might find better value at another place closer to the strip or downtown."}
{"text":"Alessandro was a great waiter. Meat and cheese plate was phenomenal was a meal on its self. Pepperoni and sausage pizza was great Service definitely was spot on Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Chicken Parmigian plate and a Chicken Alfredo plate to go. The prices online showed it should have been @ $35 plus tax. My wife got there to pick it up and was charged @ $57. Last time I checked the sales tax isn't that high in Nevada.  Secondly, if I am going to pay that much for food it better be the best food I have ever had. Not even close. I've cooked better food in my own kitchen and I am not anything close to a chef. Both plates were very bland. The chicken on the alfredo was dry.  I definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"My experience here was unforgettable! Where do I start! This has to be the best memory ever! Dinner was amazing! It felt like a little Italy . My love and I were so happy there ,we ended up chit chatting with the couple sitting next to us. talking about how amazing everything at the restaurant was next thing we knew our tables were gathered the owner shared some amazing stories with us . None of us wanted to leave hahah.... Food was delic! And the experience was the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere, food is authentic. Romantic and very beautiful . I love authentic Italia food and this was definitely five star  ."}
{"text":"Service (inside) was good, pizza (pepperoni) was quite tasty, Mushroom Risotto was average at best.  Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Julia and Allesandro are incredible people. The service was absolutely amazing! The food was the best I ever had in this entire area. The service was the best I have seen and I could not be more satisfied. I was here for a bachelor party and everyone was so impressed with the food! Drinks! And amazing atmosphere! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is FABULOUS?. Roberto, the manager, provided EXCELLENT service. The Tortellacci ShortRibs were beyond good. Also, not to be missed is the Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Makes a delicious chocolate martini. Stopped in for dessert. Must came back for dinner"}
{"text":"After walking around the Lakes a bit, we stopped and looked at the menu and we were intrigued by the variety they offered.  So we decided to go here instead of the French restaurant across the walkway.  What a mistake!  First off, the service was terrible.  We waited a good ten minutes before the server even acknowledged us with a simple \"hi\" as he walked by for the 4th or 5th time.  He then came over and didn't even ask if we were ready to order, simply pulled out his paper and looked at us.  We both ordered the gnocchi, but different flavors of it and asked if bread came with the meal.  A simple \"ya\" and then he walked off.  He brought the bread and drinks out about 5 minutes later and we quickly discovered that the bread was terribly hard and crunchy.  So, after crunching through what seemed like a crouton, we decided no more bread.  The gnocchi finally arrived and while it looked appealing, once I touched it with my fork, it was very apparent that it was way overcooked.  The consistency of it suggested that there was no pasta covering at all.  It was all mush.  My girlfriend's gnocchi was the exact same way.  After choking down a few bites, we flagged down the server, got our check (which was expensive) and some boxes.  We were hoping we could salvage the gnocchi so it would be edible at home, but that also didn't happen.  So we settled on Burger King.  Lesson learned: try the French restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I found this place on accident a couple of years ago and I am glad I did. This is located at the end of freemont street, which is very nice since it is away from all of the crowds and the loud noise. There is a live musician here on weekend nights, which is fun to listen to.  Luna Rosa wasn't very crowded when I visited, which was nice. We got our food very quickly and had excellent service. A couple of people in my party needed help deciding, but the server was able to help them by recommending their favorites. The server also provided great comedy by finding something we had in common and making jokes about it throughout our meal.  It is a little pricy, but not necessarily for Vegas standards. The food is also very, very good, so we didn't mind. Something as basic as the pizza is amazing, as are their pasta dishes.  Unfortunately we did not get to listen to the music this time, but when I came here before, it was at the perfect volume-you can hear the music and the people sitting across the table, even if you're right next to the musician. There are also many tvs by the bar where you can watch sports or the news while eating. I would recommend Luna Rosa. It's a short drive or bus ride from the strip and offers excellent food and service, at the perfect location on freemont street for a family."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Luna Rossa when exploring lake Las Vegas. The food was amazing. I got the penne al pollo e broccoli and my other half got a pepperoni pizza. My pasta was amazing the sauce was delicious and the portion size was perfect. The pricing was just right as well! We had a blast. We definitely would come back, and there should be more locations in Las Vegas, such as in Summerlin! It's be awesome. We'll be back for sure and I definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Once again my culinary mind has been blown at Luna Rossa in beautiful lake las vegas.  I EAT HERE SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK and the quality of food and service is always second to none. BASED ON OTHER REVIEWS it appears Alessandro who is one of the best waiters in Las Vegas IMO has received lots of undeserved scrutiny and it dissapoints me that many individuals that leave Yelp reviews have no idea of adversities and unexpecred circumstances that occur on a daily basis in the reataurant industry. Instead of being reasonable and understanding, some people feel soo entitled to perfection that they actual get satisfaction out of their constant negativity...... I really hope people can see through these skewed reviews and I encourage you to go to Luna Rossa and see for yourself why it is a great place to dine and ask for Alessandro. You wont be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice, food is great, no doubt. Higher end Italian dishes that all look perfect. Service was inattentive and really dismissive both times. Many years ago, we ordered the valentines' dinner with several courses here once, and they dropped off only the main entree instead of the entire coursed dinner. I remember there was no price listed on the Valentines special, and my boyfriend asked how much it was, the rude waiter scoffed at us and apparently thought we meant only the entree instead of the entire special. Strange. Then he raised his voice at us when we argued about it when he finally dropped off the entrees. We were the only nicely dressed people in the room that night, but we were in our 30's and it was all obese senior citizens in sweatpants and pajamas. I wrote an email to the owner back then, describing in great detail our valentine's dinner experience. She sent me a $100 gift certificate to come back and apologized. But we were too offended to go back. 6 years later, a friend dragged us, and once again, same service stye. Pouring tap water instead of offering good water etc, not offering refills of cocktails or dessert. I like a little more sales/info/offerings. We like to spend money and get offended when people don't feel like they can sell us things."}
{"text":"Had a horrible meal here last night on 9-19-11 for my Wife's birthday. It was a busy night with Jazz and fireworks at Lake Las Vegas, but the hostess was helpful and found a seat for fairly quickly. That was the end of the pros for the evening. We were greeted by a waiter after 15 to 20 minutes, ordered a glass of wine, a lemonade and a glass of water for my daughter. The wine and lemonade came out relatively quickly, 20 more minutes before we saw the water. Ordered a meal, with appetizer (Caprese), a salad and two entrees. The appetizer and salad came out at the same time, Appetizer was bland, salad was great. Then another 20 - 30 minute wait and only one of the entrees arrived. It was PENNE AL SALMONE AFFUMICATO  (Small tube pasta with smoked salmon, peas and shallots in a vodka pink sauce) - which came out more like macaroni and cheese over penne with smoked salmon mixed in.... underwhelming. My daughter ordered SPAGHETTI AL POMODORO (Spaghetti pasta, garlic, basil and tomato sauce), we will never know how it was because it never came. We all ended up sharing one entree, and despite asking the waiter several times, they just couldn't deliver. Drinks remained empty after delivered and we were never asked for another round, top off the water etc. Overall the worst service I've experienced and disappointing food. I'll not be back. The price for all this out the door (1 wine, 1 lemonade, 1 appetizer, and 1 entree) $60! Felt like I was robbed of a good  evening and half my wallet"}
{"text":"Great food and cool area! Wish more shops were still around though. Overall great food, and the best cappuccino I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is good that's why we came here again. But the service remained poor. Managers frowns at you. They are not too happy to serve you.  We'll have to find a better go-to-lunch place at lake las vegas. Somewhre with good food and good service."}
{"text":"We had a great meal and Sarah our server was the best...we ended up here because it was cold and rainy and we didn't want to eat in a smoke filled restaurant...in one of the casinos , the service was great as was the food, quick and well prepared..."}
{"text":"Walked in here looking for some good pizza to go. I said hello and they looked at me like I was crazy. No hello, no smile noting.  I told them I wanted one small pizza. They told me it would take 15 minutes. I said no problem. I sit at the bar and wait. Was offered no water. I had to ask them to give me a glass of water. It's hot as Hades outside!!! Give me a glass of water damn it!! Rude inattentive service. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Decent but not great.  I had the chicken parm with pasta for lunch which was average.  I was annoyed because the place smelled like fresh paint.  My biggest complaint is the automatic 20% gratuity on large parties.  15% is standard and 20% is for great service which we did not get."}
{"text":"Great view of the lake.  Good sangria.  Serve their bread with olive oil and balsamic,  traditional Italian."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at Lake Las Vegas as our \"honeymoon\" since we couldn't go on a real vacation due to being a full-time student. When we were choosing where we were going to eat, we only had about three or four options since Lake Las Vegas is small. We looked up the menu online and the food sounded delicious.  I called to make a reservation for us since it was a Saturday night and we didn't know how busy it was going to be. Roberto took our reservation and to our surprise was also our waiter for the evening. He was wonderful! He was very knowledgeable with the wine selections and he knew when to check on us without it being too over the top or not seeing him enough, it was just right. My husband and I both had dishes off of their homemade pasta menu and it was amazing. My husband is very picky with his food and even he was surprised that he enjoyed everything as much as he did. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an intimate dinner for a date night!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian in Vegas! Everything on the menu is worth ordering twice! This place has it all great food, amazing service and the best location! Perfect for any season for a family or friend get together over looking the lake Las Vegas during summer nights with a live band or in the winter when they have the ice skating on the lake this restaurant is perfect to enjoy the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"This was not the romantic evening I was hoping to have. My girlfriend and I went here last night to try something new that was recommended by the staff at the Westin.  I ordered the chicken Parmesan I asked the server to just eliminate the vegetables because I don't want to waste food. He looked at me like I asked him a complex equation, he then said he would bring me some spaghetti w/ sauce, he then explained that all their pasta is made in house and it may cost a bit more. That's cool with me.   Food comes out and there's a big pile of veggies on the plate, no problem with that I can eat around them. Then my in house made penne w sauce? It wasn't supposed to be penne humm.  Man whoever makes their pasta should go work for Barilla because it tasted and looked like the stuff in the stores. Hummmm, and it tasted turrible.  my girlfriend ordered a minestrone soup that was basically just a bland veggie broth. We wanted to send back the soup and the pasta but the waiter didn't come back to the table for like 30 min. The. He asked if we wanted a box? We said no we want to return this stuff. He took the plates and ran off and we didn't see him for another 20 min. He never apologized or asked us if we wanted anything else. We paid the bill and left. It was one of the worst meals I've ever had.   We do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"First I have to say we went here for New Years. Extremely fond memories been at this location several times. We have never had a poor experience until this year. The waiter we had we had to waive down anytime we wanted something or to reheat a cold plate.  When we got up to leave we said bye to another couple we knew there they had the same feedback and the other two adjoining tables also didn't have a great experience. I gave it three stars because of past experiences and realize any place can have an off night."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmigiana-- it was quite good. Wife had the lobster ravioli and it was equally as good. I would've given them five stars but the service was a bit off tonight. They were quite busy so I will cut them some slack. Server forgot a few things and it took some time for someone to recognize us when we walked in because the hostess was on the phone."}
{"text":"We ordered the Calamarie which was very very good. We then ordered a margarita pizza that looked and tasted like regular cheese pizza and it was extremely soft and greasy. Even after cooling down the cheese was still dropping off the crust that I had to eat with a fork and knife so we only ate 2 pieces and got rid of the rest"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian and it is delicious!  We can't get   enough of this place. Actually saw a star here also. Get the ravioli."}
{"text":"Having just spent the week at the Venetian/Palazzo we came out to Lake Las Vegas for a long weekend to unwind.  On the first night we dined at Luna Rossa and it was excellent.  Very authentic, great service and outstanding food.  Possibly the best Italian meal I have eaten.  We split the Crostini and a Caesar salad, both were very fresh and full of flavor.  I then had the beef short rib stuffed pasta with Alfredo sauce and shaved black truffles.  Easily the best pasta dish I have ever had.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I never made it to the food. Waitress walked past three times with an obvious hatred of her job. When the maître'd came to sit me at a table we past many clean and empty tables and he sat me at one with dirty dishes and made no attempt to clear one dish. Although he did fleck off some crumbs. I left."}
{"text":"The perfect antidote to the Strip!  After a week of work convention meetings, racing to dinners, and evening events on the strip, our work team was lucky enough to have ah dinner here in the private room.  Not only was the food and wine outstanding, with personalized recommendations for each of us, we felt like we were guests in Roberto's lakeside Italian villa.  Thank you, Roberto and staff, for the wonderful meal and an experience that made us feel like superstars.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise when we visited The Village at Lake Las Vegas which is full of closed or vacant restaurant/office spaces. The staff is very friendly and attentive, making room for our party of six without a reservation and during a busy 4th of July weekend. They have a great menu/wine list and the food is terrific. We started with Calamari Fritti, Prosciutto & Mozzarella and Caprese  Salad, then had Lobster Raviolis with Tiger Shrimp and Linguini Pescatora for our main course. Everything was great and we couldn't have been happier. They view from their patio is nice, right next to the lake, but The Village is pretty much a ghost town and remaining businesses are struggling. I hope they continue to stay open as they are worth visiting if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"Luna russo is  wonderful place to go for dinner it captures the essence of italy.  Alessadro is amazing . The exotica bomba is refeeshing and the best tiramusu .   l"}
{"text":"great food! awesome customer service! ambiance of the restaurant is warm and inviting"}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican Grill in Lake Las Vegas.  Well worth the drive.  Margaritas are to die for, food (all of it) is exceptional, service is incredible and the mgr/ bar keep, Omar and his amazing staff are so friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. This place is overpriced and they only try to cheat you out of more money. When I paid an astronomical amount for my rehearsal dinner, a few people stayed after the specified time drinking. The staff continued to serve them and said nothing then tried to charge them 1000 dollars. I had already left and got a call from one of my bridesmaids and on the night of my wedding had to go down there and show the contract to them that said any time after would be charged at 250. I still did not think it was fair that we had to pay the 250 for a few people still drinking. They should have just charged them per drink after the rehearsal which would not have even come to 250. When I talked with Valencia, the woman I booked it through, she argued with me incessantly something I don't think I deserved after spending 4000 dollars on my rehearsal dinner with them. She should have been apologizing profusely that her staff tried to extort another 1000 dollars from me. I had actually gone to eat with my family there prior to the rehearsal dinner just to make sure the food was good and had a bad feeling then when the wine had flakes in it like it was an old bottle and I should have just cancelled my rehearsal dinner with them then. These people are thieves and the food is really mediocre Italian anyway. Don't bother going here and don't book an event here. They are very unprofessional and you will regret it!"}
{"text":"Pizza crust was good...don't get the Cesar unless you like the fishy taste of anchovies , lasagna was bland."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE!!! Number one, I'm a foodie and an unprofessionally trained chef and caterer, but an Italian place fundamentally should know how long to cook spaghetti. The pasta was far from aldente. It was crunchy still and pasty and my son couldn't eat it. My husband ordered lasagna which came out looking like a stack of something shapeless sitting in a pool of tomato sauce which was straight from a can with no other seasoning to it. I know because I use it as my pizza sauce all the time. It was ice cold as well. Lasagna should come out baked and smoldering and at $19 a plate, you better do something special with your sauce. My daughter and I ordered the Luna rosa vegetarian pizza. It was marginal, but at least it was cooked correctly. Don't visit this place if you want anything other than pizza. The service was horrible. We had an older lady service us and it was like she was barking at us the whole time. It took an 57 minutes to get our food which I normally would not complain about if the food was good. For goodness sake 57 minutes for uncooked pasta, Tomato sauce right from the can and ice cold lasagna???  I was going to complain, but my kids said no that I would ruin their first night on vacation so I shut my mouth..."}
{"text":"Very quaint Italian establishment. Elegant atmosphere. Delicious meal with superb service. A must visit when you are in the area.   From the time you walk in the door, you know that you are in for an elegant dining experience. Excellent wine list from many of the most select vineyards. There are a variety of choices in cuisine to satisfy the most delicate palate.   You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"All honesty this place felt like it was all over the place.The location on Fremont st. was odd...you first come up to the take out pizza window but then you realize you can go inside and sit. Well with a first impression like that you would expect this place to be more casual...nope they are trying hard to be upscale...trying was the key word here :-/ At first I walked away because the \"singer\" was super loud on the key board. I get they want live entertainment but I would much prefer something on the softer side than that noise. My hunger for pizza got the better of my judgment.   The food was pretty decent....I had better pizza but what really threw me off was when I ordered their artichoke, prosciutto, mushroom and olive pizza I didn't expect it to be all segregated...I like my topping to co-mingle with each other :-) What I did love was their bruschetta toast topped with mozzarella, prosciutto and sage butter :-) That was pretty awesome! Next time around I think I will just grab a slice and a beer from the to-go window and post it outside to people watch."}
{"text":"After a forgettable disgusting meal on the strip, we drove a short distance from the Westin Lake Las Vegas to this amazing restaurant! We sat outside on a beautiful night. The bread they brought out was great. Then we ordered zucchini fritters. They were perfectly battered - very lightly. The chicken parmesan was insane. Again lightly battered and just perfect. None of that overseasoned nonsense for entrees here. Anyway, if you're in the Lake Las Vegas area, come here! No idea why they don't have 5 stars. Nice scenery, great service, great food. Perfecto!"}
{"text":"Nice location by the lake good for outside dining on a nice day. But pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"For 50 bucks you should get a steak that's of higher quality than a Dennys, but you won't here."}
{"text":"A hidden gem outside of Last Vegas but definitely worth the drive. Don't be put off by the lack of people during the daytime or the closed casino. The restaurant offers excellent service and outstanding homemade Italian food. Lake Las Vegas is beautiful and this restaurant makes it more than worth a trip off the strip."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing. The service level is good. The quality of the ingredients is not.  I could not finish my chicken dish. It was tough and rubbery. They didn't care enough to adjust the bill. Oh well."}
{"text":"A beauty location on Lake Las Vegas is combined with brilliant good and impeccable service by the manager Roberto.  The Food was wonderful and you must have the Strawberry Tiramisu!  The coffee is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Food was good but way over priced. Server was not friendly and rolled his eyes when we requested cheese on our dish after he recommended against it. Did I mention the food was WAY overpriced. For the price we paid $100 for two people with no alcohol, I would have expected better service and more food."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here Thursday night This restaurant over looks the lake beautifully and the food here is delicious.  There were a few small things that weren't on point, but our visit was still great. 1. The fake candle on our table was out 2. We were not given bread until about 15 minutes after we sat, so we ordered an appetizer we wouldn't have ordered if we knew bread was on the way. Besides these two minor issues, every thing else was perfect. The food tasted like authentic Italian and I enjoyed every bit of it. I will be happy to visit the restaurant again. I love the ambiance. It has a romantic and peaceful feel to it. This is the perfect restaurant for date night. Great Italian food and a romantic view by the lake for a decent price."}
{"text":"I am updating from my previous review as I gave my favorite restaurant another chance from my last experience. I have to say they exceeded my expectations. We were seated right away and our server Vito was great! Our food was absolutely delicious as it always it. We did not have to look for our server at all he was very attentive. This restaurant has always been special to me which is why I was saddened on my experience last time and am happy that today was wonderful. I drive just about 50 miles one way to come have my all time favorite meal and will continue to do so. Thank you for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I will start with the service was good. I did have to ask for more water but, I can deal with that. A co-worker and I went for lunch as its next to the new Denny's on Fremont Street and wanted to try somewhere new. We ordered the calamari and caprese salad for the appettizers. The calamari was good but, the sauce could have used some \"umf\" to it. The caprese was really good. I would have liked a little balsamic for it but, I just added some salt. I ordered the spaghetti ai pomodorini. My only request was no tomatoes (not fond of cooked ones) and to use angel hair instead. What I got was angel hair in butter. No flavor what so ever. There was hardly any basil or garlic.  So basically, we had an expensive work lunch ($50 for both of us) and it had no taste. Now I'm not a cheapskate but, I want what I pay for.   I won't say I wouldn't try it again but, maybe next time I'll do a dinner and see if its any better."}
{"text":"After seeing a show, my friends and I were looking for somewhere to eat that wasn't fast food.  This was about 11 at night, so our options were very limited.  We were NOT about to go to Heart Attack Grill, so Luna Rossa won out!  When we first got there, they tried to seat us inside, but we were having none of it.  There was a guy playing the guitar and singing into a microphone, so it was LOUD and it was BAD.  So we decided to save our eardrums from the terrible music and sit outside :)  They had a limited late-night menu, but there was still a good variety of dishes on it.  I had the broccoli alfredo, and that was really good.  It really hit the spot.  I liked my friend's bruchetta, too.  It was very fresh.  So I docked one star for the annoying music (it's Vegas, surely you can find someone better!) and one star for the service.  Our waiter was friendly enough, but it took close to 45 minutes!  That is CRAZY!  And it's not like the place was all that busy at 11 pm..."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant parm and a calamari app. My roommate had the lobster spaghetti. Both entrees and appetizer were horrible. The eggplant parm had no breading and was so soggy I had hard time discerning the cheese from the eggplant. My roommates lobster was overcooked and the sauce was horrible. The calamari was chewy and cold. Awful does not do this place justice."}
{"text":"We usually attend several technical trade shows each year held at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  We always stay at the gorgeous Lake Las Vegas Hilton in Henderson, NV.  Luckily for us, Luna Rossa, a wonderful Italian restaurant is located a few steps away across the square.  The waiter kindly let me practice my newly aquired Italian language skills on him to order, and then brought us wine and bread, Insalata Caprese, Shrimp and Lobster with pasta and Veal Picatta.  After dinner he brought dessert menus, then said, \"Wait - let me surprise you!\". He brought us an artistically plated dish of Sicilian Cassata.  Wow!  It was extraordinary, but then, the whole meal was fabulous, and the service was perfect.  He was there the moment he was needed, knowledgeable, professional, and very patient with my fledgling Italian skills.  I can hardly wait to go back.  Love Luna Rossa!"}
{"text":"Slow food and service ruined a great view, sunset and evening. I headed down by the water from the Hilton to dine outside and enjoy a great evening in Lake Las Vegas.   This is a nice restaurant with great ambience and perfect location right by the water. Love the patio. Seating outside, but the restaurant seating is also nice.   The food was ok, better than average I guess. I was pretty frustrated at how slow the service was so it certainly took away from the food. I was traveling for work, so dined by myself and not in a hurry. It took a long time, to get greeted and placed beverage order. The initial server had no smile and seemed like she didn't want to be there. My server was a nice guy, but seemed to be disinterested in serving a single person.   The food took a really long time, for a not very busy night. When I was done it must have been at least 20-25 minutes before my server came back to my table to check on me. I got to be so long that I started to just watch him, and the other staff move around and pretty much show no acknowledgement of my table or any of the obvious sighs I was done. Pretty disappointing for what could be a really nice place to dine.  I'll try one of the other places with a great view from the patio."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Exceptional, homemade Italian cusine in a great setting. I felt like I was actually in someone's kitchen in Italy. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here for Valentines, ok a late valentines lunch. Firstly, this is the second time we have been here. Our first visit we ordered some cafe; we were looking for a good coffee after our walk around Lake Las Vegas and this place suited our exact need. The espresso was perfecto. Our second time here we had lunch and the food was awesome! Jiovanni our server was so engaging and knowledgeable about everything having to do with our food, and the food was awesome as well."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Lake Las Vegas in a while. Came here and we're happy to find this place still open!   Had goat cheese grilled veggie salad which was delicious and a shareable size.   Have the Luna Rosa pizza which was delicious.   Nice ambiance with a guitar player and views of the lake.  Can't wait to come back and try the pasta dishes we saw at other tables!"}
{"text":"The food sucks and so does the service. The fet alfrado is the worse ever.. Its our 3rd and last time going in. If your of color don't expect service.."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Would have been nicer if there were more people in the village. The ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant was literally next to our hotel in Las Vegas. Luna Rossa offers a great dining experience, friendly staff and perfect portions of food. Everything on the menu is homemade and our bread was fresh from the oven. This is a family friendly place, but not recommended for small children or infants. Despite the high prices, Luna Rossa doesn't disappoint and we would definitely come back here if we could."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great service and great food. We had the waiter make us an antipasti plate and everything on it was amazing, especially the goat cheese. Homemade pastas were to die for. Again, the service was impeccable, very authentic waiters from Italy. Felt like we were on the streets of Italy."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE FOOD , OVERPRICED BS, they catch you in walking down lake Las Vegas saying they have ac and get you by looking at the menu, like your walking down downtown Mexico streets. Horrible customer service, never again,"}
{"text":"I moved to Henderson 2 years ago and came upon this gem while visiting the lake with my kids. Absolutely love the food. Since we found this place I haven't been able to order delivery pizza as I compare everything to Luna Rossa."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at the NEONOPOLIS site for dinner on our last trip and it was well worht it. The place was empty so we were taken care of right away. Let me tell you, the Calimari was some of the best I've had ever. Very unique flavor and the pizza was superb. If you are downtoan, please give this place a try."}
{"text":"Where to begin. When you have to ask for the side of meat sauce you ordered three times when you aren't busy, do I need to continue? If only the service and food matched the location and decor. We will never be back.  The pasta should be made in-house!! Not from a box!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Food was wonderful but the service we received was even better!  Our server was Eddie and we enjoyed him so much!  He really took exceptional care of us and was so sweet with our kids.  His suggestions for entrees, wine and dessert were spot on.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to eat in the village and try this place. We were all pleased!  The waiter was more than wonderful.  Once we sat down I realized he was going to take our palates on a tantalizing food ride.   He opened with specials which two of the four of us got.  The pork and the blue crab linguini , the other two had lamb and lasagna.  I asked which item I should start with and he asked if he could create an antipasti dish for us and we all happily agreed! Every entree item was delicious, antipasti delicious and recommended Chianti delicious!  I am looking forward to our next stay in the area.    Yes I will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"lets start on the goods... The pizza here is by far the best Ive had in Vegas. great flavor and came out surprisingly pretty fast. we ordered just a basic peperoni pizza and i cant wait to eat here again.  the bad.... service. sat at the bar last night. the bartenders were so rude and inexperienced.   will defiantly return but sit at a table next time."}
{"text":"Cute classic italian place in the village at lake las vegas. Large menu and wine list. Service was ok. He was quick and friendly, but tried to herd me into a wine I didn't want. He did offer me four free samples...  Im kinda an italian food snob as I can cook it well at home. This fare was just ok. Not awful, not great.  Gnocchi was tender, but lukewarm and the sauce had no real flavor. Similar problem with the pizza, just not awesome.  Crust was obviously made in advance...it was way too symmetric.  The sauce was ok and it was buried in mozzarella.  Again just ok."}
{"text":"hi everybody,i have been with my wife(we are from oregon) at this location for dinner a week ago,OMG what a horrible experience we had!!!! Our server(named Tina from what i remember) was extremely unkind,did not care about giving us any kind of service.i ordered a classic lasagna,and my wife ordered a pizza.the lasagna was ice-cold!!!the pizza was ok.we asked for the manager(can't remember his name but was a guy with a beard) which apologized but did nothing!!neither for the check or offering a round of wine,dessert,nothing!!!so if you are looking for an extremely overprized restaurant,unfriendly incompetent staff,and bad service in general this i the place you want to go,otherwise avoid it at any cost!!!!Mike and Jenny."}
{"text":"Our party of twelve showed up twenty minutes prior to closing and they treated us like gold! Amazing food. Amazing Service. Chicken fettuccine Alfredo was great. Spaghetti and meatballs, literally out of this world. Pizza was even fantastic. Oh and the salads. Pretty much the best experience. Our waiter was so kind even though he could've been bugged that we showed up at the last minute. Can't believe they don't have better reviews!"}
{"text":"WORST experience ever! I was literally shaking when i was walking out of this restaurant.Our server alexandro has some serious problem (perhaps pertaining to particular races/ethnicities, i'm not quite sure). The whole time i was there, service was not great at all but i didnt want to ruin my night complaining as we were there celebrating a birthday. After an entire meal of horrible service, I asked for the check and a water re-fill. Our server returned 15 minutes later, and I was in the middle of a conversation when he dropped off our check (we happened to be speaking in korean at the time). As the check was being placed (very rudly) on the table, I happened to laugh at my friend's joke. Alexandro turned around and yelled at me asking what i am laughing at. I was shocked and told him that i am not laughing at him. He started yelling calling me names and pointing his fingers down at me. I was so shocked i asked what is wrong with him and instantly i just knew he was not normal. I just asked him to grab the manager for me. He then started yelling at me again saying that i dont deserve to complain about him and he went on and on. The manager finally came and she apologized to me. She didnt want to listen to what i wanted to say and she instantly just told me that she will take care of the bill for me. I told her that i do not want her to take care of my bill and i will pay for my own food since i enjoyed the food. I was not seeking compensation, but simply wanted to inform her of the server's outlandish behaivor. I told her the problem is the server and told her what happened. She just said that she's sorry and she will take care of the bill. I told her that she does not have to apologize and taking care of my bill is not what im looking for. she asked what she can do to make things better. I told her i want a genuine apology from the server himself. she said that he is very busy and he will not come apologize to me. At that moment i just paid for my food and walked out of the restaurant with the worst experience ever in my life. I have worked for the last 10 years in hospitality (on the las vegas strip), in many facets of VIP service and this was deffinately far from that!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were at Lake Las Vegas for a marriage retreat and decided to dine here Saturday night for \"date night.\"  My husband and I shared a caesar salad, mushroom ravioli with bolognese sauce (a request we made after the very polite server, Giovanni, mixed up the specials of the day), and a pizze margherita.   YUM is all I have to say.  First of all, we told the owner of the restaurant how amazing Giovanni was. I actually spent half of the meal speaking to him in Italian. Molto Bene! She was so funny about it, she kept saying \"I know,\" in regards to his fantastic service.  The ravioli was amazing. The bolognese sauce was even MORE amazing.  Lastly, the margherita pizza was phenomenal. We ended up saving half of it, but it was so tasty that we devoured it once we got back to our room!  I cannot wait to come back! Next time, I think we'll just get the pizza. It was drool worthy, and better than a pizza we recently had at Pizza Rock, our previous favorite pizza spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some drinks and a snack after a few hours on the lake and it seemed nice until we actually ordered.  The waiter looked almost insulted when we didn't have a huge order at 3 pm and it took way too long to get our drinks.  What was worse is that 15-20 minutes after our drinks were empty, we still had to go and get the waiter for a refill.  This would have been more understandable if they had been busy, but there were only two other tables aside from ours and they each had their own waiter and there were 3 other people just standing around.    On the plus side the pineapple ripieno was very nice."}
{"text":"This is the place you'd like to go for good Italian food for sure!    Found this restaurant while in a business trip around two month ago, we continuously dine here for three nights and return to LA with full five starts satisfactions.   This trip, we rerun to it as royal customers!  Wonderful food, drinks, and friendship is the way it makes you keep going back.    Highly recommended 5 starts Italian restaurant from me!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, the price a little high. Has a great view and you're paying for that. Had the gnocchi appetizer it was flavorless. Chicken piccata.. good. My date had a pasta and just average."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant at Lake Las Vegas.  Had the Filet and Lobster the Lobster literally melted in my mouth.  Had a view of the lake.  Great and food and service."}
{"text":"Impressed with the service and the food. Greeted and seated right away, loved that there's patio seating but it was a hot Sunday evening so we chose inside which still had a great view. Staff was very friendly and attentive. We got two appetizers and two main dishes, bill was $90 with our 10% off for checking in on Yelp. Prices were expected, Lake Las Vegas and an authentic Italian restaurant. My boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo, I got the tortellini - both were very good!"}
{"text":"Love it here I taken friends that come from out of town and they love it as well!! Perfect for a romantic dinner, and the service is great too!!"}
{"text":"Best gnocchi spinach prosciutto with Alfredo. Homemade and you can tell. The manager was so thrilled we were happy, which was nice. The crostini appetizer with mozzarella & prosciutto was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Out in the desert in Henderson, Nevada we were invited in to read the menu because it was so hot outside (about 112).  Thank heavens we decided to stay!    Our waiter, Giovanni, suggested the caprese salad special.   My husband ordered a house salad and I asked to have mine for dinner.   My husband mildly asked if they had carbonara even though it wasn't on the menu.  Our waiter went and ask the chef and they agreed to make it for him.  They immediately brought (other servers) a caprese salad and surprised, I went a head and started it.  Giovanni was on top of that.  He took it away saying it was wrong and immediately sent the house salad for my husband who told me it was really fresh.     My caprese salad and his carbonara all arrived in a timely manner.  Giovanni was correct!   The mozzarella was creamier.   What a great dish.  The carbonara was excellent according to my husband.    Our waiter also suggested an Italian Chardonnay (Bramiti Antinori) that went extremely well with my salad.  Fun place!  Top notch food.  Attentive staff.  We finished with the  strawberry Tiramisu.  Light and right!  If I were ever to return to the Lake Lake Las Vegas Hilton I would make a bee-line to Luna Rosa."}
{"text":"Had 9:30 reservations on valentines told them i was running 5 minutes late, told me it was fine. I then arrived right at 9:30. Not only was i turned away they were very rude about it,Try the restaurant at the Hilton if you like good service."}
{"text":"We were looking for an Italian restaurant to eat dinner the first night in Lake Las Vegas, so we found Luna Rossa. This was some of the best Italian food and service I've ever had! I don't think rating on Yelp for this restaurant is proper, for me they deserved 5 stars!  We ordered four cheese pizza and were absolutely delicious! Every bite was just as good as the last. Lobster pasta was just amazing!! Melts in your mouth with perfectly seasoned and cooked. Clams and mussels are so tasty and the sauce was so amazing too. The strawberry tiramisu is so good and make me can't stop eating them. They have very nice outdoor seating area with great atmosphere. Don't forget they also have amazing wine collection!!! Where have you been all my life.   We really enjoyed our times spent there, it end up we went back to Luna Rossa 3 night continuously before we return to LA. I would strongly recommend this place to everyone. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place. We had amazing times and I'm definitely going back, Grazie Luna Rossa!"}
{"text":"First time to Lake Las Vegas. It was very nice there. Jazz playing down by the lake and alot of people. We went to Luna Rossa for our anniversary dinner and it did not dissapoint. Waited a few minutes to be seated.The place was crowded and we did not have a reservation. They set a table up and seated us. We had the following: Apps- Bruschetta and Calamari   -Large pieces of calamari with a side of marinara. Very tasty. the Bruschetta was also good.  -Main Coarse- I had the lasagna and my wife had the Veal Piccatta. I enjoyed the lasagna with the hint of bechamel sauce. Would order again if there wasn't so many other items i wanted to try. The Veal was tender and the sauce was perfect. Cant wait to go back and try the other dishes and their Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Last minute trip to lake Las Vegas and looking for something to eat...  We were craving Italian tonight, so boyfriend and I decided on this place.   We got seated pretty quick, and right off the bat you can see waiters running around like chickens with their heads cut off! It was pretty busy inside so maybe that's a good sign the food is great?  As we got seated, it took about 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and when we did, our waiter only asked me what I wanted... My beau was not pleased but let it slide. When he came back, we wanted a beer and asked for a recommendation, and when we asked how it tasted, he said..\"it tastes like Italian beer\". Wow, but of course!!! How stupid am I!!! So after we received our Italian beer, it took another 10 minutes to get complimentary bread... We were some what annoyed, but not too hurt since our check in included 20% off our meal!! (Thanks yelp!) so here is what we ordered:  - fried gnocchi - lobster ravioli  - pappardelle with shrimp and saffron sauce   Fried gnocchi was not crispy as imagined, quite soggy actually, but the gnocchi itself was tasty... Or so I thought for the first 3 bites. There was a weird taste, almost like a smelly mildewy cheese taste. I thought there was cheese inside, but there wasn't... Only 4 pieces tasted like that. Grossed out!!!  Lobster ravioli was descent, but the filling was a bit too fishy. The sauce and pasta were cooked perfectly though.   The pappardelle pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, saffron sauce was amazing (wish there was more of it since it seemed more like a coating) and there was a good amount of shrimp, all which were a decent size and perfectly cooked. The bread we received was nice and crusty, although it took about 15 minutes for the second order.   In general, this place was just ok. They have specialty pizzas so maybe they're more popular with that. The atmosphere seemed crazy rather than a romantic little restaurant in Italy. Everyone seemed rushed, no one seemed friendly, and it almost felt like if you took too long on ordering or asked for assistance, they put a curse upon you! Thank goodness for that discount, and pricing was reasonable ($65), but other than those reasons, I wouldn't return. That's too bad since my saffron pappardelle was delicious!!! Plus it's not worth the 45 minute drive.   I hope this place realizes that there's no business if the customer doesn't feel warm and welcome. Hopefully some staff retraining will help. I hope so, because guests will flock if the food and service is top priority... Plus, they need it all the way in lake Las Vegas... Just saying!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were in LLV for a team event.  I had dealt with Giulia previously, who helped me book a prix fixe menu for a group of about 20 people.  On the day of our booking, something happened and the power went off to all the buildings on the side of the street where the restaurant was located.    They ended up relocating us to the next-door restaurant: Mimi and Coco's Bistro and managing to offer us the exact same prix fixe menu that we were expecting at Luna Rossa.  I guess Mimi and Coco's is a partner of Luna Rossa.  Turns out to be a really lovely-looking restaurant.  They gave us a big table in the upstairs area.  We had the whole section to ourselves.  It also bears mentioning that the team event going on meant there were hundreds of extra people staying at LLV hotels.  So if they had decided it was too much trouble to accommodate our group at this alternate location, they probably still could have totally filled the place.  Especially with other restaurants closed from the power outage.    Our table was beautifully laid out when we arrived.  We had just the one waiter, but he was helpfully assisted by some bussing staff and his service was courteous and excellent.  The meal consisted of several courses.  All of which were very tasty and generously apportioned.  We never felt rushed, but neither did we ever have to wait.  Even at that big table, everyone had their meals at the same time.   Finally, the price was very good value.  Especially considering the quality and wide assortment of dishes. On any future visits, I'll be sure to visit either Luna Rossa or Mimi and Coco's, confident in a pleasant evening."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever left a restaurant feeling scammed. My fiancé and I were visiting lake Las Vegas and thought we'd give this restaurant a try... BIG MISTAKE. I wish we had read the prior reviews more. The dinner started with my fiancé ordering a $10 glass of wine from the menu when the waiter instead insisted he would bring him something special without telling us what it was. The most expensive wine glass on the menu is $12. When we got the check the waiter had charged us $14 for bringing us a wine we didn't have a choice on. He had 2 glasses which ended up adding $8 on to the check. Next we order an appetizer and a meal to split. The waiter tells us he will bring us a \"small side of Pasta\".. well the small side of pasta that WE DIDNT ASK FOR ended up costing us $20. He charged us $10 for each side that we never wanted without ever telling us it would be $10 a plate... we never would have ordered it if we knew it was. After dinner I asked for a dessert menu, the waiter insisted he would bring us something special and never brought me the dessert menu I asked for... he ends up bringing us a dessert we hated and never would have ordered... another $10 added on to the bill without telling us what it would cost. We ended up paying an extra $8 for wine, $20 for a side we never wanted and $10 for a terrible dessert. I run a food blog and have never once had an experience this bad. The food itself was subpar. Don't make the mistake we did."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there on a Sunday night. We were seated right away, bread and water were brought to the table right away.  We then had a wonderful dinner and delicious dessert. Instead of wine try their lemon drop martini. ;) We would go back."}
{"text":"Very nice place - great ambiance.   The food was delicious.  Don't forget the strawberry tiramisu."}
{"text":"It was the worst services we ever had. Very rude , disrespected us , bad quality, we will never come back and we don't recommend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Terrible !!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a chance to dine here on a Saturday night. We made reservations for 7:30, but there were still tables available when we arrived. We were made welcome from the start, it was apparent that all of the employees took a great amount of pride in the restaurant. Alex was our waiter, and he did an outstanding job in explaining the menu and guiding us towards some outstanding dishes. We enjoyed the calamari, it was just right.   For the main course we had the veal picatta, which was outstanding. We also very much enjoyed the papperadele with creamy saffron sauce. For dessert we had Dream Bomba,  delicious!  Overall, excellent and not to be missed if you are in the Lake Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Horrible. The staff is so rude... SO VERY RUDE!!! We asked about a spice in the sauce because of an allergy, and the waiter made us feel like idiots for asking. There was also a singer that made it impossible to have a decent conversation and didn't have any business singing, he is awful. I'm sorry that I wasted an evening here. I will NEVER go here again, and will tell everyone I know not too. Just awful."}
{"text":"We ate here last week and I was impressed. Good Italian food that would make my nonna angry that I liked it so much. This place IS fine dining at its best.  The gnocchi were splendid, light, tasty. The seafood pasta my husband ordered was cooked perfectly & the seafood tasty.    I had the lasagna and my goodness I wish I had room for a second piece, it was perfect.   Wish this place was nearby so I could go to it again.  Service was prompt & friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing! We ordered the Rigatoni al Funghi, and the vodka sauce, combined with the mushrooms, led to a tasteful dish that my brother and I polished off in seconds.   The penne with chicken, broccoli, and sun-dried tomatoes was surprisingly delicious. My family and I normally find chicken breast too dry for our taste, but the chicken in here were very tender and full of flavor. Overall, the dish had many layers of taste, each part, the chicken, the broccoli, the penne, all combined to create a very delicious dish.   Our waiter had a great sense of humor and gave some good recommendations, like the strawberry tiramisu, which was simply amazing. There was an abundance of strawberries in the dessert and it wasn't overly sweet.   The restaurant itself was warm and friendly.  Large windows let the afternoon sunlight stream through and lit up the warm tones of the walls. The view of the lake was also very calming.   We will definitely be coming back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Meh. Our first visit to this restaurant. We dined early at 5pm in a pretty much empty restaurant.  Overall - meh. Food - meh. I have had better for far less. I suspect that the Parmesan that they came to sprinkle on my tortellini came from a canister with a green top. Service - meh. It was neither outstanding nor lacking. The table linen was soiled from a previous diner and the chairs were filthy. I brushed off as much dust from my chair as I could - the waiter just shrugged and walked away. The view of LLV was nice from our table - we were seated on the patio since we had our pup with us. Overall a very spendy dinner for meh food and meh service."}
{"text":"This place had fresh made pasta and fresh baked bread. The parmesan here tasted fresh but I didn't confirm if it was. I had a veal chop cooked medium it was slightly over cooked but tasted amazing! My wife had the stuffed ravioli with mushroom sauce, I tasted hers and it was also amazing. For dessert, I had the peanut butter and caramel bomba. It was very rich and creamy. My wife had the cheese cake with Italian cherries that were candied. It had a very unique taste. The tase of the food was great, but the price didn't match. Although, the area is touristy, so maybe that would justify it? Service was good, but waiters could use more smiles instead of dry faces. Our main waiter was really nice though. Get ready to fork out 200 w tip for me, wife and daughter."}
{"text":"Came here with my company during an event we held at the nearby Ravella. We liked it so much that we came back twice in the 5 days we were there.   First of all, our waiter was very nice and very helpful, suggesting items on the menu that ended up being great.   I had the Chicken Parmigiana and it. was. delicious. In fact, I had a hard time choosing anything else after having that the next time we went. Now that I think of it, I don't think I did lol.   If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after a night of a unplanned pub crawl of downtown, it was Memorial Day, and we had a only planned on going to the DCR, but to our dismay it was closed that day, and so was Vanguard, boooooo. So we tried Lady Silvia, no one was in there and the bartender seemed bothered that we were there (wouldn't you be excited to see customers when the place is empty)? So we ended up back on Fremont at the Griffin.......one too many Honey Jacks later I was conversing with anyone and everyone, including Metro, and my friend decided it's time for me to eat. So we end up here and under her instructions I must eat 3 slices of pizza before I may drink anymore. Um ok, no problem. 3 tomato/basil slices down the hatch. All I remember about this place is #1 the pizza was pretty decent when you're hammered, #2 the bathrooms require a code to get (you get the code from the bartender) and #3 they have ranch dressing. This place is pretty good option when you find yourself on a random pub crawl, and compared with your other options for a quick fix in the area. This is isn't the worst option."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what to think about this place...went on a Friday afternoon and wanted to try a lunch special to split, nothing too heavy since the day was just starting. Sat on the patio and the day was gorgeous outside. Tried to order a dish off of the lunch special menu and get the sauce subbed out for alfredo instead. Our waiter, who I'm guessing is the owner or co-owner told us it would not be possible as the combination didn't go well. I proceeded to tell him exactly what I was looking for (a dish with breaded chicken, alfredo sauce and cappellini) to see if they can do something similar, so he went ahead and did so. Also ordered their fried calamari to start off. I had water (bottled) and hubby had a coke. They served complimentary bread with oil/vinegar. Couldn't ask for anything more...perfect weather, perfect location, restaurant not too crowded. The calamari arrived and half filled the serving platter as the other half was filled with some salad and the sauce bowl. Nice light breading, quantity however did not match the price point. When our meal came, our server put a plate down in between us that had a breaded chicken cutlet on the plate with a couple of lemon wedges. He also had a bowl filled with cappellini and alfredo - he put the bowl down and proceeded to split the noodles and put half on my plate and half on my hubbies...I actually wish he would've just left it for us to do on our own as I never eat half when we do split meals, I always go with about 1/3 to my hubby's 2/3, so this really threw me off a bit and I ended up having way more pasta than I would've preferred. When our meal was coming to an end, my hubby's drink was unfilled for a few minutes and our server did not come back to check on us, we had to flag down a different server that was helping a nearby table to ask for a refill.  When we were ready for our check, it took several more minutes for our waiter to come by and he asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu - politely declined. Our check came and totaled over $50 - apparently the big bottle of water cost almost $2 more than just ordering a regular soda. The calamari was priced at more of a meal price than an appetizer....and then the part that really got me, we got charged separately for the breaded chicken and the alfredo pasta - they charged us like both were meals on their own! I couldn't believe the way they nickled and dimed us...there is absolutely no way either of those could've been a meal by itself.  Yes, the food was good and the service was so-so, but when I was expecting lunch special prices and proceed to get hammered with half a hundo for lunch (that we split mind you)...I can't really feel like this was a 5, 4 or even 3 star overall experience. 2.5 stars is all I can muster based on this visit, rounded up for gorgeous location and exceptional food quality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before heading to an evening event. Sat at the bar with Jen very good bartender/server. Had a cappuccino and salad. I would definitely come back to this place for dinner and try them out the menu seemed nice."}
{"text":"Stayed at Lake Las Vegas Hilton for the RAGE Triathlon at Lake Mead and needed to carbo-load the night before. Brought my mum with me for her Staycation, and when I suggested this place, she was fine with it but wasn't holding her breath (she's lived in Italy for 6 years and has never been excited about Italian food in the States).  In this case, she enjoyed every bit of the meal! From our appetizer (Calamari Fritti) to our main dishes -- I had the seafood risotto (Risotto alla Pescatora), she had the Ribeye -- she was quite impressed and told me they were all \"cooked correctly and tasted authentic.\" She even reminisced about Rome with our server (at least, that's what I think they were talking about since their conversation was in Italian).  It's a bit of a drive from her home, but I'm definitely taking her back to this place.  Oh, we had an early dinner (I needed to be up at 4:30am for the triathlon the next day) and glad we did -- the place started to fill up around 7PM!"}
{"text":"For Fremont Street, this place is pretty damn great. Most of the time I just don't want to trudge all the way into a smoky casino just to eat a $9 prime rib.  Luna Rossa has a legit pizza oven, and the pizzas aren't bad.  My friend ordered pasta bolognese which was pretty good.  They also have a late night menu when you're not feeling hot dogs or fried Twinkies.  The food is straight 3.5 stars but the accessibility and the service push it to 4.  Remember - we're talking Vegas/Fremont Street standards.    In Vegas you're eating at the best restaurants in the country and dropping $$$$$, or you're at a buffet.  Luna Rossa is one of the few middle ground restaurants.  I like that it has a street entrance and from your seats you have a good view of the mayhem.  Definitely beats the casino restaurants!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, best service ever.  Will definitely be returning. Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp is the best."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian, and this place delivered. My husband and I started with the Bruchetta, which was delicious! They cooked the bread just perfectly. We shared the chicken Parmesan, which was a great choice because they have very generous portions. We also got a side of their penne pasta with marinara. Their pasta noodles were delicious and so was the marinara! Our service was phenomenal throughout the whole dining experience. We split their gelato to end the night, which was another generous portion of 3 scoops! The prices are a little high, but that's expected at a resort. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a solid lunch here for a party of 6.  Clams and Mussels along with a pepp pizza.  This place seems a little out of place on Fremont.  A little pricy for my taste, but lunch was good.  Service was outstanding, again a surprise for the location.  I'm just not sure this is the right spot for this restaurant.  Just seems out of place."}
{"text":"Twice a year we do a stay vacation at The Westin. For the past four years we have always ate here. The food is beautifully made its authentic Italian food! The strawberry tiramisu is to die for so yummy & fresh strawberries. I could seriously eat three. We've always had good service. Spent New Years Eve as well it's a up scale mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Salad with grilled veggies and goat cheese amazing.  Service was very poor. Automatically included an 18% gratuity so no reason to pay any attention to the guests.  Seriously didn't come back to refill drinks until they brought our bill."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's day with my husband and sons. The food was mediocre we ordered the pepperoni pizza, fettuccine alfredo and the bone-in rib eye steak. The waiter, Diego, brought our food in and instead of rib-eye, he gave us filet mignon. The rib eye was supposed to be medium rare, this filet was well on the outside and rare on the inside. Clearly a waste of good meat. We told him we got rib eye and he went to check and confirmed our order was the rib eye. but my husband didn't want to get upset so we just told him to just leave it. Ok, what really bugs me is, this waiter clearly made a mistake and not once did I hear an apology for his mistake. Our table was ignored and when we asked for refills we had to ask three times. We were nice and didn't complain (which I think now we should have spoken to his manager) but own up to it if you made a mistake. When we got the bill he still did not apologize. So I told him I would've appreciated an apology for his mistake and he just nodded and muttered I apologize. I told him no, it's too late. And he walked away. The restaurant was not even busy at all!! I would not recommend to come here because not only was the food not great but the service was just as bad. Sadly we only went here because sunset and vines was still closed but I wish we waited for it to open instead of coming here. Thank you Luna Russo for a wonderful Valentine's day experience. (I'm being sarcastic btw)."}
{"text":"I live fairly close to Lake Las Vegas, and have made a point to try to get out there more these days and try the restaurants. My husband was craving Italian for dinner one recent evening, so we decided to try Luna Rossa.   It was a slightly windy evening but we still decided to sit outside. The patio area is lovely, with a great view of the lake. There was a man playing the accordion when we arrived that played some great mood music. The man that seated us seemed to have some difficult understanding that we did in fact want to sit outside and did not need to order any wine... but our actual waiter was on point for the entire meal.   We started with the bruschetta and my husband also got a bowl of the minestrone soup, which he was kind enough to let me try (so my review would be complete he said, too cute!!). The bruschetta was excellent, the bread was piled high with fresh tomato and it was full of flavor. As was the soup, which was full of yummy veggies.   For my main course I went with the risotto al funghi. My husband had the manicotti. The chef did not skimp on my mushrooms at all, and the risotto was cooked perfectly. My husband devoured his manicotti, which is always a good sign.   Is Luna Rossa worth the drive to Lake Las Vegas from the Strip? I would say no. The food is good but I wouldn't call it great, and I found the pricing to be a little high. If you are in the old Henderson area and wanting some good Italian food, this is a worthy spot."}
{"text":"Italianisimo... Everything were great ..!   Great food , great service ... Great atmosphere ..   Todo Perfecto , excelente servicio   La"}
{"text":"We walked in and were told to pick a table ourselves so we decided to pick a table by the window overlooking the lake. A very nice view. My husband, myself, and our two daughters 9 & 12. We sat at a table with six chairs. When the waiter came to our table he seemed irritated that we decided to sit there asking with frustration when the other two would arrive. I told them it would just be the four of us. He then asked if water was ok to start and we said yes. Happy about the prompt service so far we started looking through the menu. We then waited for about 20 minutes and were not acknowledged again.... It wasn't busy. There were four other tables being served but we were not?! We decided to leave and go to Sunrisa Grill after not being acknowledged for so long. When we got to the front door the waiter smirked at us and being the passive woman I am I simply said thank you, while politely smiling and left."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I always compare wherever we go to the experiences we have had here and it never compares! Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"Been going to this Italian restaurant for over 7 years, when in lake Las Vegas .  Great location and great food .  If you plan on visiting lake Las Vegas give this place a try, we have never been disappointed .  A large selection of Italian food items, and some very good wines.    Try going on one of the days there is a concert right next door since you can sit  outside and eat and listen to the music."}
{"text":"A great little Italian restaurant away from the city. It was quiet in this restaurant on a Monday night. There's indoor and patio seating. They have a great wine selection! I went with the lobster ravioli in pink vodka sauce which I highly highly reccomend! Great for taking your significant other or family dinners as well. I enjoy this restaurant compared to ones in the city because it's not loud and there's not a lot of traffic compared to other places. Sadly the cannoli was a disappoint. The cream was very rich and delicious but the shell itself was hard. I could not even cut into it with my spoon! It hurt my teeth to even bite into it."}
{"text":"Quick \"Staycation\" for us at Lake Las Vegas before kids go to school. Looked for someplace that had pizza and stumbled across this place. Total Italian place that reminded me of a place back East.  Ordered pizza for the kids and had to try it...no joke the best pizza I ever had! Wife tried it and said the same thing. Fresh, made from scratch by first gen Italians. Great place and will be back!! Definitely worth your time!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm!  I would say this place with worth a trip to even if you are not staying at the hotel.  Another metric to use besides the star rating is how far I'd be willing to drive for this pasta. I'd say about 5-7 miles out of my way, so residents of Henderson, come on down!  What I tried: Caprese- so fresh. The tomatoes were sweet and the mozzarella was so creamy! Gnocchi in creamy pesto sauce- melt in your mouth gnocchi in the nicest creamy sauce Fettuccine in black truffle alfredo sauce- very flavorful, nice and nutty with the truffle. It was even good cold the next morning  The staff was so friendly and attentive, and they made great recommendations. A fun and delicious experience!"}

Exotic Bomba Mango, passion fruit and raspberry sorbet all covered in white chocolate Drizzled with dark chocolate * The best part of the menu, could not get enough 1 Soft Drink or Ice Tea Included per person Price: $26.00+tax+20%gratuity per person  Its a small place with lots of help, unless you ask someone to replace the burned bread on the table, instead of more bread the waiter rolled his eyes walking away probably thinking no one saw him and never brought back more.  There was one gal a bus-person who was exceptionable and I tipped her separate from the waiter.  Drinks are expensive  I paid 25.00 for two cocktails a scotch rocks and vodka cranberry.  On large plates in the center of the table to share is not what you get, it was a normal sized dinner plate and after 3 people there was not enough for the fourth and we had to ask for more.  Our waiter while taking a drink order from our second table, I touched him to let him know i wanted something, he acknowledged me stating just a second in an unfavorable tone, then went to the bar to give the tender the second tables order then helped two other people before he was in range again and I asked if my second was up so that I could add to the drink order when he said oh sorry i was busy taking an order.   So the moral of the story if your planning an event I do not recommend this restaurant for the type of service and food you should get for the price. No Value, No flavor, No service!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant in the Lake Las Vegas village.  We dined tonight and had our usual excellent service.  I wanted something not on the menu and they accommodated my request graciously.  Both my husband and my meal was terrific.  We like the fact that we are never rushed and it feels authentic.  Will definitely continue our tradition of dining at Luna Rossa."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. Seriously asked for four cheese, and got a cheese pizza with crispy bread and no tomato sauce. It's unreal. Just awful."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Had dinner with my grandparents here tonight. And my very Irish retired 84 year old ex chef grandpa is hard critic when it comes to food. But ....he loved this place! You have to try the tiramisu- especially the strawberry one. Our waiter.. Forgive me I cannot remember his name was absolutely the best!!! If you want impeccable service and great food and fantastic wine.. Go here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional! The food is even better if it can be! I have been back twice in a week! And the same great experience both times! It's well worth the small drive to the lake!"}
{"text":"We went last Saturday.  Drinks: When we first got there I ordered a glass of wine, took over 15 minutes to receive it. My friend ordered a vodka tonic that had almost no vodka. Asked waiter to take it back and take off check. He instead brought back new vodka tonic. There may have been a language barrier - English didn't seem to be his first language.   Food: It took 30 minutes to receive a soggy crust pizza.    Service: Our table was ignored - as many other tables, some people walked out. Finally had to ask another waiter for our check.  Good points were the decor and layout of the restaurant but that does not outweigh the poor service and food."}
{"text":"Strawberry Tiramisu was awesome! The restaurant looks very nice from the outside, but I did not have the best impression when walking in. Party of 2. The hostess said \"Outside is Full\" with not other explanation just assuming we wanted to sit outside. It was a holiday weekend so maybe they were busier than expected. A manager came by and said he could get us seated outside. Then when we went outside they didn't seem to have a server for us. We ordered wine and pretty much everything from the manager which did not seem correct. Everything took longer than expected including getting dinner, ordering dessert and getting the check. I am not sure if it because we were on the patio. The tables on the patio are also very close together. People would get up and break glasses by slightly bumping someone else's table. I live in Henderson and I don't make the drive to Lake Las Vegas often, but I was hoping for a better experience. I was also disappointed that the whole Lake area was pretty dead by 10pm. I am not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Very good food, and the atmosphere is fantastic (especially if you get a table outside overlooking the lake). Even though most of the other retail shops in Lake Las Vegas are closed, it is still a very nice place to visit."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Food was incredible service was outstanding. Will be coming back very soon. Tiramisu probably the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"We recently purchased a new home in Lake Las Vegas and we visit The Village quite often. Luna Rossa is our absolutely favorite place to go. We crave the pizza, the pasta, the veal...and love the service by Fausta and Allesandro!.  While our primary home is not in LLV, we wish it were. We cannot say enough about how much we love Luna Rossa. Make it a date and go there...trust me, you won't regret it! Ciao!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying what I ate was a good B+ meal. I had a prime rib stuffed pasta with Alfredo sauce and truffles. It was pretty good. That being said it was extremely over priced. Paid $29 dollars for it and it was a small to medium portion. My husband had a basil tomato sauce gnocchi. It was ok. Not worth 22 dollars that's for sure. The bread that was served before hand was so hard on the outside it was like chewing on glass. The servers breath smelled of cigarettes. Fast service though and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant, everything we ordered was great from the cheese filled gnocchi appetizer, our two entrees which was the lobster ravioli and the braised beef Alfredo tortellini and for dessert we had the strawberry tiramisu. It was all delicious and the staff was very attentive. It was very busy outside but everything came out on time. The only thing that saddened me was seeing how empty Montellago village was, as there was no shops opened. Used to come here a lot for events and fun. Hope it picks up again soon!"}
{"text":"Ended up at this restaurant for New Year's Eve because Mimi next door was all booked. We came in to ask for two open seats and the hostess kinda made it seem like she didn't care for us to be there. She asked us if we wanted to see the menu first before she sat us. We went ahead and sat down and tried it. The food was good and decent but definitely over price. Our server was friendly but he seem rush during our dinner. We ordered the bruschetta for $18 and ravioli for $49. Both definitely over price and not enough shrimp in the ravioli but taste was good. Food was good here but I definitely think the price was too much for quantity of the food. We ordered a bottle of wine as well and got the strawberry  tiramisu for dessert. Dessert was yummy. Overall we came here for last minute options and food was good but prices were high."}
{"text":"Although the food was great, my waiter was terrible. Bad attitude and was not friendly. I took my family of seven and spent $250. I could have chose the Mexican restaurant but I chose this place and wish I had not."}
{"text":"Amazing wonderful and perfect. We asked the server for his recommendation and we were so happy we did. I had the Luna Rosa Pizza my wife was served one of the homemade pasta dishes.   Vito made the best cappuccino I have ever tasted. Went for my wife's birthday. We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is to die for! Their pizzas are incredible and the atmosphere is the best! Great views of the water and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"First of all- delicious!  The waitress was very helpful and recommended the chicken sandwich. Two of my friends had it and said it was delicious!  The personal pizzas where pretty big (although the cheese was a bit greasy). My husband had the pizza and I ordered the appetizer called the \"CROSTINI DELLA TRADIZIONE- (Toasted crispy bread topped with melted mozzarella, Italian prosciutto butter and sage - very good) \" and it was enough for the two of us."}
{"text":"An Italian gem with amazing food.  Be sure to try \"any\" homemade pasta dish...you won't be disappointed...A bit of star sighting when i was there...Nigel from \"So you think you can dance\"!  guess its where celebrities go to have some privacy.  Service was attentive but not overdone...Try it!"}
{"text":"OMG, tonight we went to Luna Rossa Italian restaurant at Lake Las Vegas. The waiter we had was a small extremely RUDE man that was completely pre-occupied by a ridiculous \"so called incident\" outside the restaurant. My wife was totally appalled by what was going on and simply asked this waiter what was going on outside. This \"waiter\" spoke down to my wife and continued to now insult me as well! The manager came to out table to supposedly apologize to us. This lady was smirking the whole time which was a greater insult then the waiter himself.  My friend's best friend had a bug on the table in front of her, and they all tried to tell us it was a fly that came in. The waiter tried to accuse her of bringing a bug in the restaurant!!!!! Do not eat here; the food all tasted the same and was grossly over-priced!!"}
{"text":"Amazing wine list, ask about the vintages, I was a little worried about my super Tuscan until a 2007 arrived at our table. The food is delicious as well, I had a rigatoni with filet and truffles, amazing! The eggplant appetizer was truly fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I will start off with what is good about Luna Rossa, since this is an update, I have been here on 3 occasions, all with different outcomes. The first time here I ate at the bar and it was a good experience. The second time, I ordered pizza from the take out window. While a bit pricey - still good. Lastly, I came here for dinner with friends on a Thursday night. Now, not my number one choice to dine on Fremont Street, but I relented to my friends who wanted to go.  First of all this is what Luna Rossa is - an Italian restaurant serving mainly pizza (out of a window, no less), that is attempting (and failing) to be an \"upscale\" (HAR HAR) restaurant on Fremont Street. Their menu reflects this, especially the dinner menu. Not one item on their dinner menu is under $10. I'm no cheapskate, but the menu itself falls incredibly flat. Appetizers that they didn't have. Pizzas that with so many toppings the thin crust becomes soggy in the middle (yeck!), and overpriced entrees!  I am not paying over $10 for spaghetti and meatballs unless I am sitting in a nicer looking dining room in a place where people aren't zip lining outside, okay? AND people better be dressed nicer, because obvi this place doesn't have a dress code.  The place itself looks like an eatery - not a fine dining establishment. There is PAPER on the tables for God's sake. My friends and I had the following -  Salmon Dinner Entree - One friend didn't want pizza so she got the salmon, said it was pretty good. BUT because me and my other friend ordered pizza - she did not get any complimentary bread. Yes, Luna Rossa will refuse you bread service if someone in your party orders pizza. RI-DIC-U-LOUS. It says so right in their menu.  Artichokes, Olives, Proscuitto, Peppers Pizza - I don't remember the real name, but I remember what was on it, because  with all of those toppings the thin crust became soggy very quickly. It was like eating moosh pizza in the middle especially.  Here's the kicker - Luna Rossa charges you an 18% gratuity - NO MATTER WHAT. You had bad service? Too bad, you've already been charged. There's only three of you eating? Too bad, you've already been charged.  What is this shady business? (OK - they have it printed in the menu, but that doesn't make it any less BS.) Even if our service had been outstanding, which it wasn't, it was just basically good service - I wouldn't have tipped MORE after the restaurant has the audacity to force a required tip on me. I think they're probably doing it because of their location. Perhaps they have a lot of tourists who don't bother tipping? I don't know, I don't care. But I do know one thing - I will not be back here, and I will certainly tell my other local friends who hang out downtown to steer clear of this place as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Very authentic! Reminded me of being in Italy from the moment we walked in. Great chianti wine. We came for dessert and their tiramisu and dream bomba were to die for!! We will definitely be back! Thank you to Fausta. Such a sweet lady!!!"}
{"text":"The worst place I have literally been to. The staff is so rude. The food is questionable at best. They were empty with customers, now I know why."}
{"text":"One of my party members food  came out cold my rigatoni pasta was just ok. The lobster and shrimp ravioli was good I liked that a lot. My server came back from break smelling like cigarettes. To sum it all up it was ok"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Terrific service. We had the gnochetti fritteria as an appetizer and I could have eaten an entire plate of it by myself it was so good! The lobster ravioli was recommended by the waiter and it was on the money. Strawberry tiramisu was a perfect end to a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"We decided on this beautiful day to have lunch here. It had been a while. And while the food and service were still very good...I was taken back by the prices of their cocktails. $ 14.00 for a Vodka on the rocks........Are you kidding me....Wednesday afternoon in Lake Las Vegas which is a ghost town during this time period.....So if you are like me and enjoy a few drinks with lunch or dinner...and you don't want a bill for nearly  $ 100.00 for just your drinks, I would go somewhere else. One wonders why there was only one other couple eating in the entire place. Sorry guys but that's not right and you know it. ."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took almost 10 minutes before we were even greeted then when we asked to sit out side the hostess looked annoyed and said she would have to see. After walking around twice she stood halfway away us and said nothing then looked even more annoyed when we didn't immediately follow her. She showed us 2 tables and told us she didn't care where we sat. We waited almost 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us.  Meanwhile we realized we got sat at a broken table (we close it because it sat 3 people better) and the two tables we were shown were the onlyones with plain chairs while all the other chairs had over flowing cushions. When the server finally showed up she was very unapologetic and seemed not to care that we didn't have menus much less beverages.  We told her we changed our minds about eating there. She threw some the silverware and replies \"ok.\" And walked away. We went back around to the front and were ignored for another 5 minutes before the hostess came back around and rudely asks \"What?!\" We asked for a manager she rolled her eyes and replied \"that is me. \" At that point my husband walked out.  I told her their customer service was rude and we would never be back."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in Lake Las Vegas.  If you eat outside, you get a good view of the man-made lake.  In that sense, it's no better than dining in front of the jungle ride at Disneyland, but gorgeous nonetheless.  As for the food, I ordered the Risotto Pescadore.  It was delicious and contained a generous helping of the seafood items (clams, mussels, shrimp, octopus, and various fish).  The restaurant is a little on the pricey side, but if you factor in the outdoor atmosphere and the lakeside view, it's really not bad at all."}
{"text":"Peaceful ambience on the water... Roberto, the manager, as in true Italian style,  treated us like family. Food and service were  easily 5 star. Pricing is what you would expect for a 5 star restaurant.."}
{"text":"Went here for my b-day with 3 other friends.  It was a Monday so it was a ghost town at The Village.  It seemed that our server was the host as well.  It took forever to get anything.  He had a nice attitide but I really wasnt impressed with the wine which I tired 2 different glasses and at 11/12 dollars a glass it should be good.  One thing I will give them props about is the fact that they didnt have a cheese platter on the menu and when I asked for one he was willing to have the kitchen make one.  So we had a cheese platter, calamari and some other appetizer that had thin slices of beef on it (not sure what its called).  We didnt order entrees.  My friends raved about the calamari.  Honestly I think this place has the potential to be great but the lack of ambience in the entire place (the Village) ruined it for me.  I cant imagine they will stay in business much longer if the casino doesnt open back up.  I wish I would have ordered and entree so I'd have a more informative review as far as food is concerned but if your looking for more than just good food then I wouldnt recommend this restaurant.. and thats assuming the food is good..."}
{"text":"Honestly, I sat for 20min without a menu, as I watched them give menus and serve others. It's the closest pizza place to the hotel room . I had to literally call my order in just to get tended too. It's really sad when such beautiful scenery, has such rotten service ."}
{"text":"had their italian sausage & murshroom pizza... it was fresh out of the oven and super delicious!!!  sit outside if the weather allows... nice view of the lake..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and original Italian cooking. The best restaurant in the area. We will for sure come again."}
{"text":"Visited this place when I was in NV for a wedding. There weren't too many restaurants in the area so, it was only natural that we went here. Grabbed a drink at the bar and then ordered 3 pizzas for take out. The sangria we ordered was good. chilled and it was 103 degrees in Henderson in july!! so go figure!!  The pizza was fresh, medium sized for 20 bucks (expensive if you ask me!!) but tasted good so I won't complain!!"}
{"text":"So, had lunch here today and the restaurant looked cozy and nice with white linens and smaller version of Valentino's when I was still open (I used to work there). I thought I might be a little under dressed in basketball shorts and T-shirt but was told it OK, that was nice. Seated and helped promptly but checking the menu noticed prices a bit higher, understandable since it's \"Lake Las Vegas\" and it's a tourist restaurant.   Order margarita pizza and Lynn ordered linguini with calamari in a spicy tomato sauce. When the margarita pizza arrived it looked like a plain American cheese pizza with no tomato or mozzarella slices and some sprinklings of basil pieces cut into thin strips! Lynn's pasta looked better and I being in the business didn't complain or ask differently, thought I'd try it out.   The pizza tasted what it looked like, a cheese pizza. Nothing special: no basil leaves, no tomatoes, no charred crust, just a cheese pizza. The pasta was good but nothing again too special. Unfortunately I always compare Italian food from my experience with Valentino's and from working with my former boss, a American Italian with an Italian husband!   To sum it up when it came to desserts we opted for only a espresso for me......wait for it.......it is probably the worst espresso ever served! No offense to our server but I would hate to think he would accept a espresso like he served to me since he was Italian. Where is the nice \"crema\" on all quality espresso? It wasn't on my espresso that's for sure! The espresso looked like a small cup of black coffee! Like I said before my experience with Valentino's made me extra particular then your average Asian. I was trained to make espresso's with a nice crema so when you put sugar on top of it, the sugar sits waiting to sink or be stirred in, this was not that type of espresso. Yes, might be ranting about espresso but when you work for Italians you learn to make good espresso!   Average Italian restaurant in unfortunately a slow/dead village. Maybe it's better at dinner?"}
{"text":"This is the closest I believe I will get to Italy, for now. After a little debate between Mexican and Italian, this place was chosen, and I'm glad it was.   When we arrived, they immediately seated us and the setting was cute and small with low lighting. Picturesque I should say. Once we were seated, our drink orders were taken and the server, Leandro, informed us of the specials. One of them being pumpkin ravioli. I thought, \"Hm, tis the season\" and I ordered it.   While I was waiting in anticipation, the bread came out. And I love bread! I nearly at the whole basket it was so good. As I'm still stuffing my face with bread, the food comes out. Great more to dip my bread in! Haha! The presentation was nice (I forgot to take a picture). As I went to take my first bite, I can see someone else at our table looking; pumpkin ravioli is not the norm. Put it in my mouth, start chewing and hm it's pretty delicious. Now, the sauce was a little sweeter than I would have liked or guessed, not bread dipping good, but over all I liked it. The pumpkin was blended just right.   All while we were eating, Leandro kept checking on us to make sure everything was all right. He was very good and had a sense of humor. When we were done, he asked if we wanted desert, which we were all so full there was no way. Maybe next time. Which I definitely will be back to try the other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Seems very authentic.  Service was par but trying to split a check took 40 minutes and that had taken away from my normal stars I would give. The servers speak Italian so they didn't understand what we were trying to do I guess.  We literally had to write out the check so she could put it in the computer.   Sorry we had to do her job.  Obviously they weren't used to us outsiders.  Manager was no help and found humor in our situation.  If you are starving stop by, good food. Want service don't go."}
{"text":"I could not have adored this place more. It cheesy, I'll give you that... but kitsch is never out of place on Fremont Street!   Service was friendly and attentive. I got the pesto gnocci and made a special request for them to add capers.... DELICIOUS. So good, I recommend it. I  The place really got going when a exhuberant older woman took to the keyboards... waiters passed around tamborines, and I had a blast joining in on the music.    I recall the prices being pretty reasonable, my plate was under $15... plus plenty of soft bread on the table and frequent drink refills.  Thanks Luna for a really fun night!"}
{"text":"Classic Italian restaurant by the shore of Lake Las Vegas. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. The weather was perfect so we sat outside. The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was fabulous."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian restaurant. To start the menu options were outstanding. My wife is vegetarian and she had many options to chose from. I as well had a difficult time deciding. The service was excellent. The food was exceptional.  Probably my favorite Italian restaurant of all time. I do travel a significant amount all over the US. I/we will be back."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever! The food was awful. We even sent back an uneaten dish because the meat was rancid and they never took it off the bill. Stay away!"}
{"text":"They make the best Italian food in town! When you come here ask for Julia! She is phenomenal! Such a sweetheart too!!! You gotta try anything with the Alfredo! It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"Went out to Lake Las Vegas and this was the only option aside from the Mexican restaurant.   Mussels and Clams Served in a tomato sauce. Couldn't believe how big the mussels were. Completely unexpected.  Octopus Carpaccio Don't let the presentation fool you. The octopus is cooked perfectly. Tender. Not rubbery at all like you would expect. And the lemon oil was very refreshing."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, as we live near Lake Las Vegas and had not been here yet.  We typically go to Auld Dubliner when we are down there.  So, one weekday afternoon I decided I wanted Italian for dinner, and we settled on Luna Rossa.  It was not crowded, we were seated immediately.  The wine list is actually more expansive than I was expecting at a place at Lake Las Vegas.  But, the reds are kept at room temperature.  During the hot summer months in the Valley, this made the wine seem even hotter.  So, that was frustrating.  To start, the wife had the caprese.  The ingredients were not of good quality.  The tomatoes seemed like they were purchased from a local grocery store and then stored in the fridge, which is not good for a tomato's flavor.  Likewise, the mozzarella was mealy, didn't have a nice pull when you would cut it.  I had the gnochetti fritti, which was basically fried cheese balls that you dip in red sauce.  The red sauce needed a hit of herbage for flavor, but the cheese balls were good.  To eat, the wife had the lobster ravioli with tiger shrimp in a vodka cream sauce.  I'm ignorant, so I can't remember the Italian name of this dish.  But, it was a winner, and it saved Luna Rossa from getting a 2 star review all on its own.  It's a LARGE portion for $28, approximately 8 or 9 huge raviolis plus 3-4 large shrimp.  The sauce had a little bit of creaminess to it which was nice when you cut into the ravioli.  We took a good amount home.  If you eat at Luna Rossa and like seafood, this is your dinner.  I had the sun-dried tomato gnocchi with prosciutto in a cream sauce (again, can't remember the Italian name).  The cream sauce was forgettable, I had to douse it with pepper and parmesan cheese at the table to impart any flavor.  The gnocchi was solid, and the prosciutto was of good quality.  It basically was just 2 large pieces draped over the dish.    We didn't plan on having dessert, but when I saw they had strawberry tiramisu we had to give that a shot, as strawberries are my favorite fruit.  It was good, but we couldn't finish it due to sweetness.  It comes in a large wine glass and is layered with cream, lady fingers, and strawberry sauce.  There were a few fresh strawberries on top, and I could have used more of them.  The bites with all ingredients were excellent, but you only got a couple of them.  This is a fair price at $8, but I would prefer to pay a little more and get fresh strawberries in every bite.  They have a large patio which I bet is an excellent place to dine when it's not 100 degrees daily."}
{"text":"22$ for pizza margarita?Below average food and way too overpriced.Server was waiting by the table until I tip him which was really disturbing. Nice atmosphere thiug"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and authentic Italian food.  I enjoyed my meal... not a 5 star though."}
{"text":"Great meal and service. Portions are large enough to share.  2nd time here.  Both times awesome service and food."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place.  Warm friendly staff that provided such great hospitality.  The food was so great.  The portions are very generous so consider splitting with dining companions.  Atmosphere is nice.  White table cloth service overlooking Lake Las Vegas.  Would recommend this if you want a nice Italian."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Italian food!!! Been to Italy many times and this lasagna was the most authentic I've had in the states. Want to eat every meal here as I can't wait to try everything they make. We also had the pizza and gnocchi appetizer which were both delicious. Can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"The staff at the restaurant was very rude and I will never return again. The food is nothing to right home about and service sucks. I also felt as if I was being discriminated against because of my race."}
{"text":"I wish I had looked this place up before settling. I came here on my anniversary, it has to have the absolute worst service ever. On top of that the food... the food tasted so plain and not as flavorful as I depicted. We were both excited to have a romantic dinner next to the lake, but our experience was nothing more than being at an expensive McDonalds. We had the absolute worst table where when someone opens the door to the outside it would swing and hit our chairs. Not to mention they literally separated us from everyone else as if it we were living in the 50's. Ridiculous. Our servers and hostess were completely rude and for some reason ignored us our entire dinner when we asked for a refill. I didn't want to leave because they had a delicious looking dessert menu, but when we tried to order the only thing they had available was a cheesecake?! Really? Why would you even bother having a separate menu for it. In all honesty if you are looking to order a lasagna that cost $26 and was drowned in sauce maybe you'll love this place. Will never be coming back. Everything about this place was a joke. Spend your money else where. It's not worth the time and money to come here."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 for my husband's 40th birthday and Roberto (the boss) was welcoming, funny, and personable. He took care of us by serving us his suggested mixture of antipasto and discounted our bill.   The food was just as delicious. Roberto allowed us to order stuff that wasn't on the menu but it was on yelp. Must order the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy trying new restaurants. However, if you want friendly service, this is not the place. The waiter,Allesandro  very RUDE.He claimed to be the manager and the waiter when I asked to speak to a manager. He definitely did not like his job. He talked as if I was beneath him.The worst experience and service ever! I will never go back again!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for me and my wife. We used to eat here at least once a month. The food was great and service was awesome. Now not so much. It seems that there is a child seating people and they have no clue what to do. When we walked in it was busy and we we're told no reservations when we called. So we asked to be put on the list to be seated. Lol, this girl said we don't have a list. What do you mean. I asked well then how do you keep track of who's up next to be seated. At that point someone came in and walked right by me and said we have 2 and they got seated. I looked at her and said what was that. She said well you have a large party ok no problem  then how long will it be, then just as I asked some waiter came over and said what's the problem I asked how long it would be he said 45 mins. As he looked at me to be surprised and walk out not to return. I said ok we will see you then. He got all piss ed at me for some reason. So we went back at about 40 mins she said no table yet. OK. Another 30 mins went by she said sorry no table. So I said you just seated about 25 people as they walked in. Wt.... the answer well they just walked in. Wtf are you talking about. If you can seat 25 people as they walk in then you can seat are party of 10. She said oh we just gave your table away so it will be another 45 mins. So I went to talk to the waiter who told us 45 mins in the 1st place he said if you talk to me again im Calling security. I thought to myself wtf is going on here. We are now 2 hours waiting and guess what no table available.   This new management needs to get some real people in there befor this place runs into the ground. How do you not have a waiting list. It's so elementary for a restaurant. Stop giving your your daughter and sons a job and run the business correctly other wise it will run its self into the ground.   By the looks of the reviews it's seems this has become the norm for this place with no common sense on how to run a restaurant. And children running the show. Great job to the new owner. You really know how to run the place into the ground.   GET A WAITING LIST. AND A NEW STAFF OF WAITERS. IT'S OBVIOUS THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO DO."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We didn't get our water until the middle of our meal. It took us to order 3 times for our sprite. And we never received bread at all. I tried to talk to the manager and she could care less. They said that they are super busy so they can't do anything about the poor service. The worse! And they call this fine dining?? Junk!"}
{"text":"This place has a good view of Lake Las Vegas and excellent lasagna. Two important reasons to go there. Also, a good Italian wine selection. Prices are $40-60 per person plus drinks. Was $155 with tip for the two of us.  Ice cream parlor nearby too."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner this past Fri evening.   Giovanni was a great host and waiter.  We learned a lot about the food, which was excellent!  We will stop by again while staying at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Was at Lake Las Vegas for a staff retreat today. My party and I decided to have lunch here. Food was amazing! The pizza was delicious! The cheese they use is to die for! Calamari was on point. Lightly breaded and crisp to perfection! That marinara sauce! Speechless! Chicken parm was amazing as well as the gnocchi. Definitely must try. Food itself could be 5 starts but customer service is a big factor when I rate a place  We got there when they opened at 1130AM and they had a total of 3 tables that included ours. The other tables were also part of our retreat but we decided to dine in separate tables. Our table was the first to order yet it was the last to get our food. My salad and the calamari came with the two pastas which arrived about 15 minutes after our pizza!  They also messed up on our pizza. We ordered half pepperoni and half Hawaiian. They gave us a full Hawaiian with pep on half the pizza. Um? That is not half and half. To top it off when I told the server he knew about and states he was already dealing with the chef. Um....if you knew about the issue you should have told us  and asked if we still wanted the \"messed\" up pizza or what.   Finally, getting the check and paying took another 20 mins.   Overall, food was AMAZING but service was not so much. Knocking off two stars because of SERVICE only."}
{"text":"It was our first time in this area.  Oh wow, such a nice surprised!  We were there on a Sunday late afternoon, most of the restaurants in the village are not opened until 5pm for dinner.  Which left us very limited choice but I'm glad Luna Rossa didn't disappoint us.  This place is a little old school, very Italian and authentic restaurant.  Roberto was welcoming and funny!    The homemade gnocchi was the bomb, Roberto was right, they do have one of the best gnocchi in town.  Nom Nom Nom....  The fried calamari was delicious as well!  We ordered the pizza as well but we were too full to eat it.  It sounds gross, but the left over pizza still taste delicious on the next day!  Definitely will go back if I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Started with the caprese.  It was okay, nothing special.  Had Santa Margherita pinot grigio with dinner - always a winner.  The pre-entree bread basket had these hard, compressed bread nuggets that were difficult to break into the crust or chew.  Even a soak in the olive oil/balsamic at the table did not do anything to soften them up.  Had the grilled salmon entree.  It was done medium well, so I was happy.  The accompanying green beans were sauteed and crunchy.  The roasted potatoes had a good flavor.  Not much attention from the wait staff.  I guess I could say I've been here, but probably will try another place on my next visit to the village."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was serene and romantic. The buffalo motsarella and tomato salad was delicious. For entrée  we had a Mergeritta  pizza and the Chilean Sea-bass which was recommended. Both dishes lacked in flavor. I was expecting a more robust flavor in both dishes considering the price if these dishes.  For dessert we had the pineapple sorbet which was presented beautifully and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Pianist was great, but felt the need to be really loud at the end of each song. Became a joke. Biggest issue: their Creme Brûlée is DEEP. Not enough burnt top, too much filling. Big and shallow is the key to Creme Brûlée. This was too much Creme, not enough brûlée."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the pepperoni pizza. It may seem a bit pricey on the menu for such a plain dish, but I assure you it is well worth it. The cheese just melts in your mouth as the whole thing just dissolves on your taste buds. The service is a bit slow to start out with, but as soon as that pizza comes out. All the waiting feels like nothing."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on the night I proposed to my girlfriend. We got there later than we expected with less than an hour before our arranged gondola ride. When we walked in it was empty, but steadily picked up in business as we were there. We advised our waiter that we had to be down at the docks in 50 minutes and he took care of us quickly. We both got a different rigatoni dish, and they were amazingly good. The pasta is al dente, but most likely would be cooked longer if requested. We also ordered garlic bread which was delicious and was not added to our bill. Overall I enjoyed my experience and recommend that if you visit Lake Las Vegas to give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"I was trepidatious at first to recommend this place to my visiting  friends because of the complaints about the  service. I was delighted when our server Aldo came to make us comfortable in the outdoor area where he arranged  heaters and tables for our pleasure.  The food was authentic and lovely as mentioned often here. But it was Aldo's attentive care and suggestions that raised the meal to a wonderful dining experience.  We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Another one of my go-to places when I'm in Vegas.    It's not the best Italian food in the world, nor did I expect that from a small, tourist-friendly walk-in establishment on Fremont Street.  But it puts out respectable food at decent prices with better-than-average service.    My wife and I found this place based on a recommendation from a Tix-4-Tonight worker at the 4Q.  For $2, we bought a voucher that gave us half off a second entree.  Why not, right?  We tried Luna Rossa, liked it, and have gone back a half-dozen times in the past year or so.    After a few hours on Fremont, I'm never really in the kind of shape to give a review worthy of submission to Food & Wine magazine.  What I can report is that having grown up on Italian food in northern N.J., I can safely recommend the risotto, carbonara, bolognese, and rigatoni al funghi.    One weird thing I ran into:  I bought a large beer at the ABC store on Fremont.  I then walked down to Luna Rossa to have dinner.  They told me I had to finish it before I could come in.  Fine, whatever.  Then, I noticed that other people were bringing in their drinks (the football beers, the oversized fruity drinks, etc. sold on Fremont).  I asked the waitress why my low-rent beer was being discriminated against.  She told me that they allowed drinks purchased on Fremont into the restaurant (the touristy-type drinks) but not cans and bottles.  Personally, I prefer policies that make sense.     Again - don't forget to buy the voucher and save some $$.  My wife and I are headed back to Fremont in a couple of weeks.  I'll see you at Luna Rossa!"}
{"text":"There was a big in our water so we left. Also each dish is about $30. I don't know what would make a pasta dosh worth thirty dollars,  I know they are not making their own pasta in the back,  or catching fresh shrimp."}
{"text":"I ordered Tortellacci Ripieni Brasato Di Manzo Al Tartufo Nero and it was so perfect I did a scarpetta to my dish!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Brews Best Beer fest. Was seated right away. Wanted pizza but told no pizza. No explanation. Ordered the calamari to start. It wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. The seafood pasta dish I ordered had way more pasta than seafood. I will say that the flavor was very good though. Over all it wasn't a bad meal but, with the service we got, we did feel like it was a bother that we stopped in. They seemed unhappy and/or ungrateful for our patronage. I don't know if this had anything to do with the Beer Fest, but next time I think we'll try a different place."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian restaurant we had a late lunch in. Everyone around us was speaking Italian as were all the servers.   We ordered the muscles and clams in an amazing tomato garlic broth that was sopped up with excellent bread until it was gone. We also had the caprese and Cesar salad. The Cesar salad had a nice garlicky dressing and was not overdressed. A great meal."}
{"text":"Food Amazing! Service and staff, not so much. Wife and I were both happy with our entrees. I had the mushroom risotto and my wife had the shrimp ravioli. We both were impressed by the food based on the negative reviews we saw online. Our waiter didn't read us any specials but overheard another waiter read out the specials. We had to ask ours to please let us know what the specials are, I shouldn't have to ask. The manager seemed rude based on our first interaction with him as we walked in. We walked in, he was busy doing other task and just looked at us with no expression. I had to greet him and ask him for a table outside. I was going to give this place 4 stars for food but the overall guest experience is a 3."}
{"text":"My family and i walked in.. We werent even greeted. We were given our menus without any greeting or explanation. The only staff member who talked to us was a busser who noticed we didnt have water. We kept waiting for a server to approach us to ask if we were ready to order.... They were just chit-chatting in the bar. Worst thing about it was.. There was only 2 tables other than us! Guy with the long braided hair was the one who just opened the door for us and handed us our menus. No greeting whatsoever and just kept passing our table. We walked out."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I LOVE this restaurant!  The sangria is worth the drive to Lake Las Vegas alone.  Be sure to get the clam linguini, and lobster ravioli!"}
{"text":"We wanted to go to a last minute dinner during our staycation in Lake Las Vegas. We called Luna Rossa to make a last minute reservation after I did a little yelp investigation. Luna Rossa was very pretty and clean. We were sat immediately and ordered calamari to start which was a good consistency and paired with a delicious dipping sauce. We were starving and not feeling too adventurous so my bf ordered spaghetti and meatballs and I had the lasagna. Both delicious. One of the best lasagnas I have had. Aldo was our waiter and he was extremely attentive and personable. Aldo is definitely a fine dining trained server. We were seated by the window and an umbrella fell, leaving the sun shining brightly into our faces. Another server (maybe server assistant?)saw this and promptly went outside to adjust the umbrella to shade our face. I'm HUGE on service and they were all 5 star. Highly suggest."}
{"text":"Service was superb!! Everyone was incredibly nice and accommodating.   We sat outside because we had our fur baby. They were very nice to even our fur baby.    The food; I'm not even a huge fan of Italian but I tasted my sons spaghetti which was delicious.   The sauce is the best sauce I've ever had.  I also tried my husband pasta with sausage. Oh it was fantastic!!!   The atmosphere is relaxing and the lake views are spectacular!!"}
{"text":"For all the poor reviews, I was expecting less than the authentic meal we experienced. Pros:   Indoor A/C or lakeside alfresco dining.  Service was excellent. We even received complimentary limoncello when we mentioned our travels to Sorrento and the Amalfi coast. Live accordion music gave the place a lovely ambiance. Fresh and light calamari. Not oily and generous portions. Great portions of clams and mussels. Fresh and light gnocchi. Excellent and various flavors. Been to too many Italian places that use the same sauce for everything...definitely not the case here! Also, the desserts were great! Fantastic tiramisu (not to soggy) and great Sicilian semi-freddo.  Cons: Caprese salad was a little skimpy on the basil and tomatoes.   Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with my aunt for lunch and it was awesome! Right by lake las vegas water on a beautiful day and our server was so passionate about his menu items I loved all of the suggestions he made to us and could tell he loved the food they make. We had the lasagna, a salad, calamari and it was all delicious!  Will definitely be coming back there again! You get 10% off your first check in at this restaurant and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Weirdest reception I have received in a long time.  I was hanging out waiting to be seated and several staff members hustled around me with no acknowledgement.  Finally a nice man noticed me and summoned the maitre d (I am assuming) who came over and said \"Can I help you?\"  Perhaps he did not know that women by themselves still needed to eat (I am trying not to judge here).  After the initial awkwardness the experience got better.  My actual server was fine.  It was annoying that the Rose by the glass was not available.  I ordered a calamari with pasta which was okay but by the end of the dish it felt a little one note and I think I may be spoiled by getting fresh squid off the boat where I live, so I was disappointed that the squid was likely frozen a bit rubbery.  They do make a point of providing bread for the table with olive oil and vinegar which is always appreciated.  I would also have liked them to turn up the lights a tad so I can see what I am doing.  Nice patio seating when it is warm enough."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas for two 40th birthdays in our group. We decided to hit the \"village\" for the last night of our trip. We called Luna Rossa prior to our visit, to check on their closing time. When hearing they closed at 9pm, we realized we wouldn't be able to get there until 8:30pm. The person on the other end of the phone said that would be no problem, and they would see us when we arrived.  Upon arriving in the village, the place seemed like a ghost town, and we were skeptical about the quality of the restaurants that remained open. We found Luna Rossa, and a sweet Italian woman seated us right away on the patio.   At that time, we were the only diners and the patio, and it was perfect. There was a sulphur-like odor coming from the small lake next to the village square. However, it faded in and out.   Our waiter, Alessandro, who is from Italy, was amazing! We were greeted promptly, drink orders were taken, and we began with a shared appetizer, the Gnochhetti Fritti. The appetizer was delicious, as well as the wine we ordered. Next, we asked if we could be made a \"family style\" Caesar Salad (which wasn't on the menu), and  were told we could definitely be accommodated. We ordered one meal to be split between three of us, the TORTELLACCI RIPIENI DI BRASATO DI MANZO. We also ordered  the PAPPARDELLE ZAFFERANO E GAMBER, and a friend in our party asked Alessandro to bring her whatever he wanted. She said she wanted something \"spicy and with shrimp\".   When our main dishes arrived, we were all extremely impressed. Our food was wonderful! We shared amongst each other, and were all very pleased.   We told Alessandro about our birthday celebration, and I happened to have candles for the occasion. I asked for a dessert to be split, and he assured me he would take care of it. He also mentioned there were two couples inside that were also celebrating a 40th birthday.   The other couples had finished their meal, and Alessandro brought them out to meet us and to have a drink with us before they left. He provided Limoncello shots for everyone.   When Alessandro came out with our birthday dessert, we sang and enjoyed our shots and TIRAMISU. Alessandro continued to respond promptly and efficiently to our every wish.   We laughed and talked with the couples Alessandro \"matchmaked\" with for a long time. After they left, and the restaurant had long-since closed (it was approximately midnight at this point), Alessandro continued to make us feel there was no rush to leave, and we enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere, conversation, and last night of our trip.   We finally left around 1:30am and truly enjoyed our 5 hour experience! We were so impressed with Alessandro, the rest of the staff, the food, and our total experience. We can't wait to visit Luna Rossa again on a future trip to Las Vegas, and request our new favorite server, Alessandro!"}
{"text":"Omg Bad Service!  This review is for the walk-up window only.  Went here last night which was a Saturday.  My bestie and eyed the piña colada machine and decided to get one to share.  The lady was a little short with us and short on her customer service skills as well,  and when I asked for an extra shot of rum to put in, she got aggravated.  I ended up getting charged a whopping $17 for one drink!  I know that this lady must have to deal with drunken idiots all the time on Fremont, but geesh!  She obviously filled out the application and got the job so it is what it is.  Stay Away!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pastas and wines with a view of Lake Las Vegas, their version of the Ponte Vecchio and gondolas.  Lovely place for lunch.  Great service with charming waiters."}
{"text":"OK, I know everyone's supposed to be friendly at a bar and the staff makes great tips when they are. The female bartender at this place was witty, friendly and deserved the extra tip we gave her. She recommended the colder beer instead of what we ordered and proved to us that she wasn't trying to get rid of some less wanted beer! I'd be back here again if I didn't live so far but I will go there next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the calamari with angel hair pasta and my wife had the grilled salmon dinner. Food was excellent. I come back here every time I'm in lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was great.  I got the pizza with chicken and broccoli."}
{"text":"Good is expensive for what you get. The waiters have a lot to be desired. Terrible service it is embarrassing to bring out of town guests constantly get orders wrong, bring appetizers with the meal. So tired of going there and getting such awful service. Not worth the price. They need better management."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Owned and operated by Italian immigrants. Everything here is excellent. Beautiful location at Lake Las Vegas in the village. You can dine on patio and enjoy the lake view. Looks like Tuscany in the desert. Really magical serene place. I am looking for a second home here I love it so much."}
{"text":"A last minute Sunday night decision on where to eat turned out to be a delightful dinner. We grabbed another couple and decided just to try a different pizza place. I did a UrbanSpoon search and found some good reviews out in Lake Las Vegas. There house wines were great and reasonably priced and we could of made a meal on their soup. Some combination of a bunch of vegetables, but really tasty. Never did end up with a pizza, cause their specials sounded delicious and they were. Take the ride. Worth it. Oh yeah, Migel, our waiter...long pony tail and a fabulous personality."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. I'm not one to give low stars but this place just did not cut it for me. The food was bland and overpriced. The service was generally okay, so I won't harp on that. But let's talk food quality. We ordered the gnocchi and chicken Cesar salad. Let's talk about the salad, it was pretty gross. The lettuce wasn't good, and the chicken was dry. I could hardly eat it. It tasted like it was sitting in a fridge for a few days. Then the gnocchi, that was better but not by much. They were cold when served and deep fried. Now granted I'll take that the frying of them could just be their style but cold and fried. Yuck. Last thing I'll comment on is the dipping sauce for the gnocchi. It tasted like they opened a jar of Prego and put it in a container.  I was really disappointed by my experience. I hope you guys won't take this as me wanting to bash you. You have a lovely spot and potential to be really good. Please, work on it."}
{"text":"For being one of only a few restaurants at Lake La Vegas Village, it's not a bad choice. The service we had was pretty good at the beginning, and then rushed and annoyed at the end. After we got our food, the waiter didn't look at us once. Still, the handmade pasta was fresh and tasty. Cream sauces are heavy, so share unless you've got a big appetite! Salads were simple but fresh. Prices are a little high, but, again, there's not much choice here."}
{"text":"It was back to Luna Rossa for another delicious Italian meal.  This time I had Zuppeta di Cozze e Vongole, mussels and clams in a spiced tomato and garlic broth, along with Gnocchetti Fritti once again, and a half order of excellent creamy Caesar Salad.  My entree of Scalloppini al Tartufo Nero with Mushrooms added, thinly pounded veal sauteed in White Wine Sauce topped with shaved Black Truffle, and served with delectable Roasted Potatoes and assorted vegetables, met all expectations.  The mushrooms were plentiful, and the vegetables colorful and varied.    Once our waiter forgot one wine refill.  Otherwise, service was excellent in a comfortable and casual lakefront setting."}
{"text":"The food is is good the service is great nice view on the lake if you seat outside but something missing there not sure what ,Maybe a good vibe or a music ."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I had their special of the day that came with side of vegetables. I asked if i can have pasta instead and they accommodated me instantly. Food was great as was the service."}
{"text":"WAY OVERPRICED! When reading the Yelp review of price, etc, there were only 2 $$, but when we sat down for dinner with the menu in hand, the review did not match the average cost of the dishes, drinks, etc. The \"fresh\" bread was squished and dry (clearly not freshly baked). Our waiter was not very friendly and not very attentive of basic needs- water refills, Parmesan cheese after the dinner was served, checking on us for anything we need like a new beer, etc. There were 5 of us and there was an included gratuity!!! There was no toilet paper in the bathroom in any of the stalls, I informed the bartender. They don't validate for the parking structure across the street either. For the prices they charge, the venue, service and food did not reflect the high price.  Won't return."}
{"text":"We had lunch on 8/5 what a lovely little restaurant. I had lobster ravioli. It Initially came out with this amazing sauce that exploded in my mouth as soon as the fork inserted in my mouth. What a joyous and happy moment. Then I realized that this greatness was too good to be true. This sauce is cream based and some sort of lactose.  I had to send it back and they remade it for me with the marinara sauce. That was still delicious but the original way was amazing!  The ambiance was great. Outdoor seating available also. Overall what a nice lunch or dinner place.  We will return 5 stars!"}
{"text":"For an Italian family, this place is quite a disappointment. We had a party of nine and tried almost every popular dish and the cannelloni was the only good one."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere but after sitting with our menus closed for over 10 minutes and being ignored by everyone but a kind busboy, we left."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to in the us. I am Italian and I have very high standards as far as Italian places are concerned. I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when my be took me there for the first time. The food was delicious. We got fried calamari and baked salmon with veggies! Our server was very accommodating. I asked to replace marinara sauce with something else because of my stomach and he came up with a great solution for me! We had a great time, the atmosphere was amazing. I noticed that most of the tables were reserved, so I think it would be a good idea to make your reservation in advance. It got very busy  later in the evening. I am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Luna Rossa has been my go-to for Italian dining for quite a long time now. I feel that because it's not in the midst of hustle & bustle, it feels like I am on vacation when I go there. The outdoor dining is in itself relaxing, and when you visit on a weekend evening, with festive lights twinkling, hear live music on the lake and watch people relaxing or dancing, the experience is complete. I have had several delicious wines here. Even the prices are not as steep as they would be elsewhere in Las Vegas. Calamari, oh so good!! Entrees, just as savory. This restaurant has served for birthdays, Mother's Day, family visits, client lunches/dinners, date nights, afternoon lunch breaks, and just because. Luna Rossa has you give pause to your day in true European fashion, and I will continue to be a loyal patron. I enjoy conversations with all the staff as well! See you there soon!"}
{"text":"We ate here on our honeymoon and it was as probably one of the best meals I've ever had. I'm not a macaroni and cheese fan but once I tried it I will always order it! We will be back for our first wedding anniversary"}
{"text":"Wow! Nothing short of excellent. Amazing wine and Roberto the manager is so kind and accommodating. We had the chicken parm and mushroom risotto and we're both so pleased with our meal. To top it off they offered a buratta caprese which was to die for! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, view & service.  Lake Las Vegas is a well kept secret.  We shared wine, pizza, pasta in a bit of peace & quiet."}
