{"text":"Great! Good flavor, Mac-n-cheese has a nip to it, mostly lean meat, but wondering why I got 2 slices of bread with my 2 meat special instead of a muffin? Otherwise very nice staff and great food"}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the pulled pork sandwich! So tender and juicy. Brisket was also amazing! Perfectly cooked and juicy. Gotta try the ribs.. Falling off the bone delicious.. Yummy corn bread. Really great food! Worth every penny and the trip. Very friendly staff also."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about coming I'm not a bbq fan but my boyfriend is. We've been to bbq places before but I've never had anyone wow me. I got the 2 meat special I had the ribs and brisket the bbq on the side for the brisket just in case. It seriously blew my mind. The bbq sauce was amazing the meat was nice and tender the mac and cheese, and baked beans were fire! My boyfriend had the 3 meat special with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork with baked beans and mac and cheese he was beyond impressed. He couldn't stop complimenting the chef and his wife which are also the owners. The restaurant feels so cozy and nice.
It's a hidden gem in Henderson. The owner came and talk to us told us about how it started and his previous experience and more of his background. He told us he loves what he does and once you take that first bite you know he does. Definitely going to be my bbq to go place. Only down side was the no beer but rules are rules since they are next to green valley hs it's understandable so I brought the rest home and I'm enjoying the rest with a nice cold beer.  keep up the great work! You can also write on the wall I didn't do it this time but I will the next!"}
{"text":"So decided to check them out again after first order. Great service, the fried okra with ranch sauce was an awesome hit at the crib. Great meaty ribs and very gud bbq sauce. Now this is definatley a good spot to get your rib fixes. Keep up the gud work."}
{"text":"Our children told us about a great little barbecue restaurant not too far from Green Valley High School. Tonight, we decided brisket and ribs were just the ticket for dinner.  First, let me just say that when you walk in the restaurant it smells AWESOME!   All smokey barbecue goodness.  

Then add to that the very sweet team who manage the restaurant - they are proud of the food and truly like what they do.  The chef advised that only the freshest ingredients are used and his owned blend of spices.  After speaking with them, I ordered ribs, brisket, mac & cheese, skillet beans, and heavenly corn muffins.  

While I was waiting for all to be packaged, I received a sample of the brisket.  Oh my god, it was perfect!   The sauce was sweet, but not too sweet, smokey, but not too smokey, and on and on.  The brisket was perfectly smoked and just melted in my mouth.  

Fast forward to everyone eating and everything was so great!  All the meat and side dishes were prepared beautifully and perfectly seasoned.  I cannot recommend this restaurant and the food highly enough.  It is a hometown jewel.  My family will be back!  Hope to see you there....over sweet potato or apple pie...yum."}
{"text":"Today, I'm going to give them 3 stars. I whole heartedly feel that this will change with time but at this point 3 it is. 

My husband and I each had a pulled pork sandwich with the slaw on the side, we also shared sides of mac and cheese, fried okra, a large soda to split and hot sauce on the side. ($24)

Cole slaw has always been very risky for me so I didn't want to chance ruining my sandwich. Surprisingly, I really liked the cole slaw, it would have been just fine piled on top. 

The pulled pork sandwich was really good. Definitely the strongest player in our experience. It was soft but not too soft, the barbeque sauce was sweet and delicious. The onion roll was the cherry on top! Absolutely loved it.

The mac and cheese was plain, a good plain though. Maybe it had a few jalapeno pieces in it? ...not enough to really make a flavor impact. 

Okra is one of my favorite things to eat with bbq, if you've never had it, you have to try it. The fried okra was good, I would have liked the pieces to be a bit bigger so each bite has a better veggie/breading ratio. 

The hot sauce was very good, it wasn't that spicy but had a nice flavor. It's a watery hot sauce, not the thick smother-your-food kind, but still delicious.

The service was awkward, she was very polite and checked up on us during our meal. We were one of two couples in the restaurant so she had time make sure we were happy. She seemed very nervous, but sweet. She seemed to not know where any of the keys were on the register so ordering was a slow awkward process. The food came out in only about 5 or so minutes.

I do wish they would have had the drink choices where you can see them at the register because when we ordered our drinks she didn't ask what we wanted so I assumed it was out in the lobby. After taking a glance around I notice it was in the back and quickly spouted out \"Coke please\". If I had known they had strawberry soda, I would have been all over that.

The dessert selection they had displayed did not look enticing, which was a let down because I was looking for peach cobbler to close the meal. They had something that looked similar to peach cobbler, but they looked kind of dried up and maybe a day old (or two).

The 3 star rating mostly comes from lack of menu options, I was craving brisket only to be disappointed by their 4 options: hot links, ribs, wings, pulled pork sandwich. After ordering I saw a flyer that said \"brisket special\" upon asking I was told they didn't have that anymore. I'll just have to check in for the brisket every once in a while. I'm sure being a new restaurant effects their ability to provide variety.

Overall: 
The food was average/good. 
The service was awkward/good. 
The menu options were disappointing.
The location is fantastic.
The music was great.
The price was decent.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich and BBQ skillet beans, that's what I'm talking about.  Always hot and so good. This is my 5th time back.  I love the writing on the walls for the guest.  This is the place for lunch.  Friendly staff with a great family attitude."}
{"text":"I'm really excited about Hog Heaven,the Baby Back ribs are your best item fall off the bone tender!!! I have been three times and all three times the ribs have been so tender,the results are delicious. My grandchildren had BBQ sauce all over their fingers!!"}
{"text":"The brisket is delicious! A great little place tucked behind another restaurant.  Service was great and the food was delicious. The seating is a bit scarce if you were to dine in, but we got it to go and had no complaints."}
{"text":"The BBQ was pretty good, but everything else fell short. The cornbread was dry, the sides were mediocre (canned beans are always canned beans ... even if you add saut√©ed peppers and onions, $4 cheese fries with unmelted shredded cheese on top is just unappetizing, the sweet tea tasted a bit old, but the Mac & Cheese was good!). The sauces were a highlight as they were clearly homemade and the wings were perfection - the saving graces for this visit. We might be back, but when we feel like Famous Dave's might've been a better option for the money, it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Finally found a good BBQ place with excellent customer service and yummy food! Ribs and collared greens are BOMB! They even deliver! Don't miss out by not trying & going to this place! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas! I've tried multiple restaurants out here and none of them really impress me. Hog's Heaven had a nice selection of everything you would want.  The service was great and we will definitely be back. Great job Anthony and V!"}
{"text":"My husband brought home a menu from here that Gator Pizza had in their shop. Since we both love bbq we decided to give this place a shot and I'm so glad we did. I ordered the bbq wings and they were huge. Very juicy and the sauce was delicious. My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was cooked to perfection. Everyone was very attentive to us and made sure we had everything we could possibly want. One lady even offered to change the tv if we wanted to watch something besides the music channel they had on, but we were jamming out to the y2k music they were playing. 

The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because it was insanely hot inside. There was a fan but it wasn't moving the air enough to make it comfortable. Other than that, we will definitely be back because our neighborhood needs good restaurants and now we have Hog's Heaven."}
{"text":"Barbecue aficionados, your prayers have been answered, again!  A new bbq joint has opened up! Hogs Heaven BBQ is the newest and the fifth barbeque joint to open in Henderson in less than a year. So far everything we tried the ribs, mac 'n cheese, and honey butter corn muffins, all legit status!

FAQ's ...ok...only two visits in, so here are the deets so far:

Q. What meats do they have?
A.  Babyback, Links, Chicken and Pulled Pork (no brisket)

Q. What about sides?
A.  Offhand I remember, mac n cheese, collard greens, fried okra, potato salad, all homemade too!

Q. Any desserts?
A.  Yes! Pies!!! Sweet Potato, Bourbon Peach Cobbler, and Apple..all made from scratch!

Q. How are the meats prepared?
A.  Their menu says smoked for hours in mesquite wood. Bbq sauce is smothered over the ribs. 

Q. How were the ribs and your meal, did you like it?
A. Oh hell yah! Our family loved it enough that after the sample Doug had us try, we ordered 1/2 rack of ribs, even though we had dinner already!  We are also a big fan of their bbq sauce, it had just enough zest to it. Creamiest mac n cheese, ever! I like that here was a bit of jalepeno to give it a lil kick!

Q. Ambiance? Service??
A.  Fast/Casual dine in/take out/deliver.  The place is clean, max occupancy 55, There are couple tables that fit families and seating around backside of restaurant. A large screen TV.. Menu board above on wall, or grab one on counter.  

Service is great! Family friendly. Dining space is just right. Smells great in there! 

The two young ladies we met the first time there were very helpful, Doug who prepared our ribs was really cool and when we told him it was our first time to try, he offered us each a rib to try!  Next visit Verlice(sp?) introduced herself to me as the co-owner, her husband is the bbq genius.

Q. Okay Shirl, where is this place again?
A. Cross streets Warm Springs/Arroyo Grande. The restaurant and parking entrance faces Arroyo Grande. Your visual cues Dairy Queen on the corner, just drive a little past that and the Chinese restaurant(which is now closed). You'll see the huge banner on their storefront, make that turn into their parking lot.

What I think is also cool, they have kids meals, they will soon offer a special lunch menu during lunch hours for Green Valley HS students. They DELIVER! The prices are really reasonable and in line with the other bbq joints in the area.  

Now to decide which is the best bbq in Henderson...that's tough, because each place has their strong points and nuances that shine through. For sure, I'll get the baby back ribs, order xtra sauce and sweet potato pie here. Welcome to the Hendo hood, Hogs Heaven! Hey, you can call Henderson barbecue heaven now!"}
{"text":"They just sold out of brisket, but hubby & I tried a 3 meat combo. Ribs, pulled pork & BBQ wings.... messy and yummy!!! Beans and Mac n Cheese were okay, but we will have to come back to try the brisket & some other sides too!!

We have seen some really good places at this location, but since it's tucked away behind everything it doesn't get much traffic.  I hope it gets more traffic so it can stay around. :)"}
{"text":"So first great great great service and good food!!! Worth going to again to try more menu items. I ordered  pulled pork sandwich, potatoe salad and a glass of tap water. The reasons I did not give a 5 star are as follows: Plastic silverware (I don't mind plastic or paper plates, but I like real silverware), the bun does not hold up to the pulled pork, I had to eat 95% of my sandwich with a fork, potato salad was under salted for my taste, but was great with the homemade seasoned salt on the table, and I thought for a lunch close to $12.00 was a bit steep especially since I only had tap water to drink. Another thing I was a disappointed about was they had packaged hot sauce instead of homemade. Don't get me wrong I overall enjoyed my meal and the folks there are extremely friendly, it was just the little things where they missed. Oh and the portions are perfect!!!! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for bbq in Henderson. Located in the same lot as the DQ at Arroyo Grande and Warm Springs. Note that the entrance & parking lot is on the back side of the Mexican restaurant. 

Dropped by for lunch on Monday around noon. Ordered a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on the side and a small order of collard greens. Total w/tax $11.34

I have not tried much of the menu yet, so my rating is based solely on the few items I had. I do plan to try out their ribs as they are smoked for 6+ hours.

Pulled pork sandwich: Definitely satisfied my craving for the day. The pulled pork was served hot with an adequate amount of sweet BBQ sauce. The onion roll was extremely soft, but when paired with the hot pork, made it difficult to hold in my hands. I ate most of the sandwich with a knife and fork; which I don't mind doing, especially when the sandwich is well packed with meat.

Coleslaw: Offered as a topping on the pulled pork sandwich or can be served on the side. I opted for it on the side. Served in a generous portion. Coleslaw had a nice balance of flavors..not too overwhelmingly mayo-y. Cabbage tasted fresh and crunchy. Only detraction: black pepper was coarsely ground, some of which were too coarse for my taste.

Collard Greens: Arrived piping hot. Definitely a lot soupier than I've tried in the past; I prefer for my greens to have a bit more bite to them. Paired well with the pork sandwich. After finishing the greens, I was left with about 1/3 of a cup of the cooking liquids.

Service/Location: Staff was extremely friendly and often checked to see how my meal was going. Restaurant space was clean with two large picnic tables and a couple smaller tables. Dined in for lunch and was surprised that no one else came in to order or eat while I was there.

Overall: I'll be back to try the ribs and some of the other sides offered. Desserts were tempting too."}
{"text":"Ok kids  today restaurant reviews is a little  bbq joint (hole in the wall) that's been around for years but has moved  2 or times over the years. I ordered  the Brisket lunch special with coleslaw and Mac-n-cheese and honey butter muffin.  The food is served  smokin hot. Very tender meat cooked to perfection  the bbq sause is good not overpowering on the meat . The Mac-n-cheese  is good Cole slaw is a mayo based with a taste of sugar.  
Now as far as the ribs the last time I had them they where good , saving this for the next review. I would recommend  this place to anybody that want good food and good price $$$"}
{"text":"I have made it my mission to find a good barbecue place in the Las Vegas area, specifically a place with good baby back ribs. Its has been very difficult. I have tried a multitude of \"highly\" touted places across the valley. I haven't really been satisfied with any of these places. I saw that Hogs Heaven opened up by Green Valley High School near where I live so I thought I would give it a try. I have since tried the baby back ribs three times. I have been very happy with the ribs that I have tried. I would even go as far as to say they are my favorite Ribs in Las Vegas period. They are very tender ribs with a good sauce that is not too sweet with the right kick. They have ample meat on them as well. Las Vegas is definitely a barbecue desert. It has been very frustrating to find a good place. They also have a very friendly staff. I do not often recommend places or critique them because I am not very fond of the yelp culture. However, I deeply admire good barbecue, and I want others to find good barbecue in Las Vegas because it is so difficult to do so.  This will probably be my only Yelp Review unless I find a place that is better. I would give this place a try if you like baby back ribs."}
{"text":"First time and glad we stopped..really cool folks...smacking good Q...BBQ jones satisfied"}
{"text":"Undecided about this place. Their ribs are great! But I just ordered buffalo wings and they were way too salty. Might have been good without the extra salt, was inedible."}
{"text":"from the moment we walked in, i had a feeling this place was legit. it's small and has a homey feel to it. you immediately notice their \"og wall\" that is like a real-life yelp; people draw on it and write down their praises for what seemed to me was about to be some delicious grub. the owner immediately introduced himself to us (its a family-run joint) and shook our hands. once the food came out, i took one look and realized i truly was in hog heaven. i ordered the brisket and hot wings, and it came with two side options (i ordered the fried okra and mac & cheese). and, yeah, my suspicions were confirmed...this place is legit af. if you ever find yourself in the henderson area (or vegas, for that matter), make it a point to come find this place."}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday afternoon.  Parked by Dairy Queen and walked over to find they have a parking lot right in front, just have to drive around the back.  We ordered a 3 meat combo.  They didn't have many meats to choose from.  We picked ribs, links and chicken wings.  Meats were really good, especially the wings which we only ordered because our choices were limited.  Portion sizes for the meats seemed a bit small compared to other spots.  Mac & Cheese and Beans were our sides.  They were ok.  I would probably skip the beans next time.  We also got an order of Hog Fries Supreme those were dope.  Highly recommend.  Only slight disappointment was the dessert.  I was hoping for peach cobbler but they only had a few slices of pie that didn't appeal to me.  Overall, solid family owned bbq spot.  Definitely deserves a repeat visit.  

I think they do not take American Express.  The girl at the counter said my card didn't go through.  I used another card and then called Amex who said no charge was attempted."}
{"text":"It's been extremely difficult to find decent barbeque here in Vegas, but even more so in Henderson. This new restaurant is a nice change of pace for the location and the shopping center overall. 
The BBQ is excellent but a few times they have been out of certain items. I also think their seating is way too limited. They can only realistically seat two parties of people. 
I think it'll be a great spot for after the high school football games or for lunch occasionally.

I met the owner when it first opened and he is a very nice, professional individual and I could tell he is passionate about his business. I know with time this business will eventually thrive, and hopefully expand!"}
{"text":"Not your typical chain restaurant BBQ. This is real BBQ folks. Amazing flavors, huge portions and friendly staff. So happy to have this gem so close to home."}
{"text":"Honestly.  This is one of my worst BBQ experiences in the world.  The restaurant is not very nice, its difficult to find and the menu is extremely limited.  I ordered brisket + 2 sides and an unsweet tea.  They only serve sweet tea.  The brisket was a very fatty cut, dipped in BBQ sauce and there are very strange chunks of something in the Collards.  Overall, this is not a great BBQ restaurant.  I would suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and perhaps I'll come back when the kinks are worked out. The ribs were very big and meaty I'll give them that, but two-thirds of the rib meat was dry and a third of it was actually really tasty, the fatty part of course. they had no sweet potato pie even though it was on the menu and there was an actual sweet potato pie sitting on the counter. The macaroni and cheese was tasteless and so were the collard greens."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't know what else to say... this place blows every commercial/chain so called BBQ place out of the water! Amazing ribs, huge slices of juicy brisket and the best damn greens I've ever had! We couldn't leave without trying one of everything! And as a small business owner myself I love the customer service and pride they have in their food! The owner came out to check on everyone and talked to us like old friends! We will be regulars here... I have no doubt!"}
{"text":"We've been here two days in a row! Great food friendly service. Nice hidden gem mom and pop joint. Anthony will make you a great meal...Authentic bbq in green valley!"}
{"text":"We just finished our food from our first time here. I got the Hotlink sandwich and it is great. It is topped with grilled onions, cheese, and BBQ sauce. Anthony gave us a sample of the ribs and it is by far the best ribs we have ever had. Definitely check this place out. You will not be disappointed. We will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out because I wanted to try a new place and the positive reviews convinced me to go here! Note: this place is a little tricky to find because it is connected to the Mexican restaurant in the plaza. They have their own little parking lot in the back or you can just park near the Dairy Queen and walk past the Mexican restaurant.

I ended up getting the 2 meat combo with the ribs, brisket (recommended by the staff), fried okra, and french fries. The highlight of the meal would have to be the brisket because it was really flavorful, tender, and filling. I wish the portion size was bigger! I might just have to double up on that if I do come here next time. The ribs were good, but they weren't special compared to some other places I've been to. The fried okra was okay, but I felt like it had more batter than actual okra so I will probably try a different side. Fries are steak cut and are okay. 

I would recommend this place if you have any cravings for BBQ and are too lazy to travel far lol."}
{"text":"with another new BBQ place opening in town I wanted to see how they compared to the ones I frequent for a comparison, plus these guys are closer to my work and residence.
First thing I noticed on the menu is that they didn't offer a meat combo, something I am used to ordering so I decided on the 1/2 rack of ribs, mac n cheese and baked beans. 
Ribs were dry, like they may have been done for a while and reheated
Mac n cheese- nothing special with these, they put jalapenos in the mix, not a fan
BBQ baked beans- again nothing special about these either.
Seating is limited and the benches are wobbly, just an overall unimpressive experience."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and I use say the service was phenomenal. I met the owner and he was delight. He took care of us as locals, for sure. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!!! This place didn't live up to those pictures that are posted!!!!!! The meat was very bland no smoke flavor, and was drenched in a tangy Bbq sauce to mask the quality and flavor of the meat."}
{"text":"I went there last night for the first time and met Anthony the Owner! Cool guy! The food was the best bbq I ever had in Las Vegas living out for 11yrs!!!!! I will be going there again today for some more good BBQ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Henderson BBQ scene! BBQ has been one of my favorite foods since I lived in Texas so I'm happy to try each new spot that opens in the area. Hog Heaven was a stand out for me in the local scene.

Don't let the hidden location throw you off. They are in the DQ parking lot at Arroyo Grande and Warm Springs, but on the back side of the Mexican restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is not fancy, but it's clean and simple. There are a few long picnic tables for those that want to enjoy their BBQ at the restaurant. We did takeout since it was a weeknight and we wanted to get home. 

My husband and I both selected the 2 Meat Special that comes with two sides. Priced at $11.99 it was more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food included. We also added a Corn Muffin and Peach Cobbler to share.

All three meats we tried were delicious. The Pulled Pork was the stand out for us. It was super moist and had a nice sweetness to it. The BBQ sauce on top was delicious. The Ribs were amazing as well. The meat was so tender that it just fell right off the bone and they had a nice smoky flavor. The Hot Links were hot as expected and also flavorful.

All four sides plus the corn muffin were delicious too. The Baked Beans had tons of flavor with a hint of sweetness. The Potato Salad had a pleasant tasting dressing and wasn't too tangy as can be a problem with potato salad. The Macaroni and Cheese did not hold back on cheesy flavor and tasted great. The Fried Okra was lightly coated with a well seasoned breading that made for a delicious side. The Peach Cobbler was good, but not amazing. I'm definitely going to try the Sweet Potato Pie next time.

The cook (owner?) was very friendly. They were out of the Collard Greens that I originally ordered and he made a point of apologizing about it. He said he'd owe me next time which was not necessary, but appreciated."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place because it's within walking distance from my home.  Nothing really stood out to me as being anything special and nothing is drawing me back.  There were not many choices on the menu if you don't like pork--I was hoping for brisket or fried chicken but they didn't have either one.  The fried okra was decent but the okra was a little sparse--although the portion was generous.  The macaroni and cheese was super cheesy but not super flavorful but decent.  The music and television were both so loud I could hardly hear myself think.  The girl at the counter was very sweet and accommodating.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience, I'll probably not go back."}
{"text":"I had to add a star after I tried their fried chicken. It took a little while to make (like 25 minutes) but it was totally worth it!

New update: They are losing 2 stars because they have a bunch of kids that work there with absolutely no concept of what customer service is. They have taken their fabulous fried chicken off of the menu and I will most likely not be returning."}
{"text":"ribs are great! fall off the bone! hot link sandwich are amazing and so are the bbq wings! a must try!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! We tried this place Saturday night and my plan was to go back Sunday after church for more peach cobbler. My heart sank when it said CLOSED SUNDAY. Food was great and the owner was super sweet. They accommodated us and made us happy. We're going back."}
{"text":"My partner and myself always looking for good barbeque.  You either have to travel on the other side of Vegas or you grill yourself.  I didn't know this place opened a year ago.  I know now and I am a fan!  Just text my mate at work to let him know that finally Henderson, NV.  has discovered some \"flava.\"  God knows it needs it.  You have to try the peach cobbler and the link sandwich was da bomb!

To top it off, Anthony (the owner) and his Wife are incredibly nice people.

{"text":"Without a doubt the best bbq this side of the moon. I love small hole-in-wall family owned and operated restaurants.
If you're seeking fancy decor then this is not the place for you...just simple clean tables and benches. It's a little hard to find the first time...just remember that it's located behind the Mexican restaurant. 
I ordered the half slab of baby back ribs and a small portion of beans. They are smartly cut individually..no fighting to separate them. The amount of no fat meat is truly amazing on each rib. The bbq sauce is absolutely 110% fantastic.
The beans were just right...not too spicy..not too bland. 
I was offered a sample of their just made Mac & cheese..not a side I ever order...but I noticed that they offered Banana pudding...another item I rarely order...I asked if I sample it instead of the Mac and cheese.
They brought out a full size piece and I'm glad they did. All I can say is double WOW. I think I just found my new favorite favorite dessert. 
Anthony the owner came out from the back to make sure everything was perfect...and it was. .in each and every aspect.
Be sure to bring your appetite..appetite appetite as the quantity is equal to the quality."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely won't be the last. Ribs and wings were yummy! Had the mac n cheese and beans for our sides, both were amazing! Hope this family owned BBQ joint does well!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at work today  from Hog's Heaven BBQ. The pulled pork sandwiches are filled with flavor and juicy meats. The ribs are awesome as well. The potato salad, mac and cheese were good too. I will definitely be eating here more often. They even deliver which is great for when you don't want to go out in the heat for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb . Reminds of back home in LA.Hands down best BBQ in town . Best service ever . Everything made fresh . You not going find anything better in Nevada . Thank you"}
{"text":"Yum! Everyone says they have the \"best\" BBQ in Las Vegas and typically they're either \"almost\" there or so far from the best it's a wonder they're in business. Yesterday we found the best BBQ in Las Vegas, well actually Henderson. The ribs are cooked to perfection and yes, they fell off the bone, sauce was thick and tangy with just a tiny bit of sweetness. The kids pulled pork was incredible. Served on an onion bun, it was savory, not fatty and could fill up an adult! Hot link was covered in melted cheese on a soft bun that held together until you finished every last delectable bite. We loved the service. Truly, it was like being around a friend or family member that just loves to cook and feed you until you can barely move! 4 adults ate for $34.00. I'm a fan and will absolutely be back again. Location is just a tiny bit tricky but make a turn at the light and you'll be in Hogs Heaven soon enough!"}
