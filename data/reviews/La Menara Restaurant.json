{"text":"Well a very interesting concept. A friend was back in town from Australia, so a group of us decided to go to La Menara. The concept is a Morrocan theme, which include tajines and belly dancers.

The decor apparantly hasn't changed much in the last 15 years because there are pictures on the wall that illustate that. The seating arrangement is very uncomfortable. Low benches and extremely low tables that make you think you are in a harem, and not the good kind. Makes it very hard to eat and socialize.

Ther service however was excellent. Very kind and accomodating. 

The food is a 35 dollar 4 course meal (soup, entree, main, dessert). The vegetable soup was ok. I really enjoyed my escargots which was my choice as an entree. It was spicy, just how I like them. I got the salmon for my main. Nothing special very ordinary. The vegetables that accompanied them were not very good either. There was a side of couscous that was decent. Overall, the food didn't stand out.

The other thing that was interesting about this place is the belly dancing. There were a couple of them and they weren't bad. But when they get the fellow diners involved that's where you see some people try too hard.

Anyways just keep drinking and the night will go by quickly. :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a horrible experience here! I originally thought this restaurant would be a great location for my bridal shower and went to meet with the owner in January 2016 to see the restaurant in person. When I first visited in January, I thought the place was wonderful - the decor was beautiful and the food was pretty good. I was fortunate when my cousin hoster her birthday there a few days ago. I feel badly saying this so openly and publicly but it was a very bad experience - not only for my cousin and I but for her 20 guests too. It took 30 minutes for a glass of water to arrive and another 2 hours for the food to arrive ...Many of my cousin's friends ended up leaving early because the food hadn't arrived by 11 pm and they were hungry! Two other guests found hairs in their food - it was probably the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time and I certainly will not be doing my bridal shower there!!!!"}
{"text":"You could drag me kicking & screaming back to this den of degradation.  Ordinary food complimented by men and women trying to belly-dance and in the process looking like fat, sleazy puppets.  If you must go, go drunk...you'll laugh at the antics...and quite possibly not be able to remember the silliness the next day."}
{"text":"!!! Horrible Experience !!! - The food was BAD ordered the Sea Bass dish as entree the fish was stale and cooked even worst. Ended up leaving the place just after the starter course which was also forgettable noting unique, authentic or safe at this place.   

Never again - Bad food, bad service & an disgrace to beautiful Old Montreal restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Beau restaurant , bon plats ,  belle chorégraphie de balladie  faite  par les danseuses du restaurants qui invite les gens  à danser avec eux s' ils le désirent . C'est bien d'y aller pour une évènement spécial. 

J'ai adoré cérémonie pour verser  le thée  de menthe ."}
{"text":"Super beau resto dans le vieux Montréal un décor à faire rêver et à se croire dans un conte des milles et une nuit. Service aimable. Idéal pour les groupes voulant se dépayser, découvrir une cuisine de l'orient dans ses bases, et aussi s'émerveiller en observant les danseuses du ventre qui nous font littéralement quitter Montréal pour aller vers des contrées exotiques"}
