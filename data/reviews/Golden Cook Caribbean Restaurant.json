{"text":"I have tried many Caribbean restaurants and this place never disappoints.  The rice and peas is perfect! Never overcooked and always so flavourful.  I've tried both the jerk chicken and the oxtail as well and it has never disappointed me.  I often drive out of my way just to get some good food from this fine establishment.  I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Update: This place wins my favourite Caribbean in the hood (out of 4 establishments). I visited the highly-touted place which I mentioned in my earlier review and did not find it as good as Golden Cook."}
{"text":"Not too bad
Place isnt too big but has a wide range of things available
I was actually next door buying food for the bf but i wanted something else
So i walked in this establishment and there was a very friendly lady behind the counter
I got ackee and saltfish w food ...but because i was feeling a little under the weather i told her only dumplin no banana , etc. 
She was more than happy to oblige and even wished me to feel better. 
The food looked nice and hot made fresh when i arrived. Its just her alone so dont expect anything extravagant.
I think her focus is grocery items or more so meat, in a few freezers. Also few carribean items like cookies, sauces, seasonings, drinks, etc. 
The food was pretty good and flavourful.
My only complaint is almost no saltfish but a whole lot of ackee which is usually the case. So i wasnt surprised at all.
Paid 12$ for ackee and saltfish and shirleys cookies."}
