{"text":"By far the Best Hangover Restaurant in the area!

Their food is good but not amazing. 
The portions are generous.
Their staff is very attentive; you will NEVER finish your coffee before it's refilled.
Most of the patrons are old folks, that's neither a positive nor negative comment, just a fact.
The place just feels like a standard home-town diner and that's exactly what I want every time I go there.
If you've ever seen the movie Ground Hog Day, the diner in that movie is pretty much the atmosphere of this place.
Seriously, this place is a fantastic Saturday-morning hangover cure."}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch in town. All you can eat buffet Sunday mornings. Perfect for meeting family or going after church. Friendly atmosphere, cozy, and exceptional prices. Great local flavor."}
{"text":"OK so I can see the truth in some past reviews: I mean the place is a little older, it's in a strip mall, it's not a culinary adventure but it's really nice people with home style food that tastes good, is served hot and is quick.  Some days that works! 

As a parent to 14 months old twins if I want to eat at all like I mean one meal a day at all it's got to be all of those things - quick hot fast and friendly because seriously you want friendly at least in one bit of your day...twins can be a nightmare.  Obviously we aren't wasting away but man it feels like it when all I want is a good brunch. 

Their breakfast buffet on Sundays was pretty tasty - fruit bowl, bacon, sausage, ham, eggs, fried potatoes, obrien potatoes, some delicious bread pudding thing, pastries and cookies (which I actually didn't get to try. C someone's two little kids went nuclear...oh um yeah...)

Thankfully they seemed ok to have us back - Jessie was really nice and kind to us (which lost servers aren't when they see kids) so we shall return and we will do so hungry!"}
{"text":"Sadly, they are out of business. Stopped here last week and a Restaurant equipment auction sign was in the wondow."}
{"text":"One thing, GREASE GREASE AND MORE GREASE. Everything here was so oily and gross, even the toast looked like it was sweating. I sucked it up and ate it because I bought it and I was with family but man was I sick a couple hours later. I don't like leaving such negative reviews but there is something seriously wrong here. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere homey but it needs some updating and maybe some dusting too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times... and honestly all I can say is that it is OK. It is like food to fill your stomach... but not food that you particularly enjoy the taste of. I have had breakfast (the omletes are pretty decent), as well as some main sources. Any meat I have gotten was a bit tough. The salad bar is pretty weak in my opinion. But this place does have the small town diner feel and most of the time the service is good."}
{"text":"Decent food and service. Limited, but existing gluten free and vegetarian options. Breakfast menu looked good."}
