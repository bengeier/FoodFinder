{"text":"Today I was supposed to get a BLT with avocado instead I got a vegie sandwich.  I was also charged a dollar for a deli item I didn't order.  This was my first and probably last experience at Sam's deli as there are too many other options close by."}
{"text":"We pop in to Sam's fairly regularly due to its central location, but it seems the sandwich ordering/assembly process is much more difficult than it should be and often results in incorrect orders. For example, what I ordered - turkey breast on sourdough, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, extra mayo, mustard. What I got - turkey (check), cheese (check), lettuce (check), tomato (check), avocado (check) on toasted bread (no) with bacon (might be an added bonus to some, but if you don't eat pork products, not so much) and mayo. Their ingredients are high quality, so while their sandwiches are fresh and flavorful, they aren't inexpensive - so it would be nice if they were right."}
{"text":"I love this place - I go whenever I'm in town! The best sandwiches with the best meats ( Boars Head-yummm) The coffee they make is really tasty and they make everything with care. The Ceasar salad is to die for - fresh, crisp, zesty and oh so tasty! I highly recommend the Itailian Combo - it is the real deal. The '5.00 sub' place cannot touch this place - it is deeelish and the prices are great....HIGHLY recommend!!



UPDATE: looks like the old owners are across the way at Steve's Deli now. New owners don't seem to have the knack as Sam and Ellen. Go next door!"}
{"text":"I have noticed that they are having much better \"specials\" lately that are reasonable. For that, I up them two stars. I also missed breakfast at home so I stopped by and got a bagel with cream cheese due to a convenience factor. $2.00 (not bad) and it was nicely and freshly served."}
