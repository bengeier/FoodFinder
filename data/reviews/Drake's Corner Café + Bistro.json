{"text":"Despite the fact that I live basically across the street, I've only eaten at the Drake once before this past weekend. It wasn't bad the first time I suppose I've just found myself there for drinks only since then.  So last Sunday rolls around and my husband suggests we go for brunch, really glad we did. We each started with a Drake Caesar (the classic one) but it had a really great punch of fresh horseradish that I loved. I prefer a celery garnish to the olives served here but overall the cocktail was excellent and the rim was nice and peppery.   I struggled between ordering the Caleb Benny or the Bagel + House Smoked Salmon but went for the bagel in the end. I'm SO glad that I did. This is not your traditional long slices of smoked salmon, it's chopped up finer and has more variance in it's texture. Below the salmon was whipped cream cheese and above was a chow chow topped with alfalfa sprouts. The chow chow had the most wonderful sweet, tangy, pickled flavour to it. It reminded me of a sweet giardiniera. I've been thinking about the dish ever since - I even finished the massive portion.   Husband had the classic benny and also almost finished his. He loved it and really appreciated the 'real' slices of ham. No deli meat here. Also the fresh cheddar biscuit was a welcome subsitute for an english muffin.  Man, I might have to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Overpriced. Underwhelming food. Inexperienced service staff.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Two members of our party waited 20 minutes after everyone else's food was brought out for their chicken and waffles. The gratuity was also added automatically, which is fine for a large group, but it's your job as a server to TELL THE CUSTOMERS that it's already been included.  There weren't that many tables, but our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time without giving any update on the food that was still missing from our table after half of us had already finished eating. I ordered the benny and it was seriously ho hum. Definitely not worth 15 bucks. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I couldve spent my drake gift card on impressing ladies in the underground getting them hammed but i took the smarter route and spent the plastic on meeself at the upstairs cafe.  go here on a good weather day, the patio is awesome and even the inside is fairly open. the host of glutton for punishment was eating at the table next to mine (dope show!) ordered the drake burger. talk about damnnn juicy. really simple w bacon and (first time trying) Russian sauce. fries were also really good. staff is always sparkly and you can grab little eats to go.   don't be inimidated by all the patrons with big sunglasses and egos, this place is definitely the spot for a lunch date on queen w."}
{"text":"Brunch here on the weekend is great! Food and drinks are delicious and the service is always friendly. They even take reservations! The side patio on a warm day or the lounge by the front window are my favourite places to sit. I find the bistro to be cramped, especially during peak times.  To drink I recommend the rich, spicy and refreshing Drake Caesar. It's thick and lush and a meal on its own. The coffee here is surprisingly delicious as well. A nice foamy cappuccino always hits the spot for me.  My favourite things to eat on the menu are the eggs benedict and the chicken and waffles. Everyone knows that eggs benedict is only as good as it's hollandaise sauce and the Drake doesn't disappoint. The hollandaise adds to the richness of the runny yolk and balances the toasted english muffin and salty smoked pork loin. It's a classic done right.   Chicken and waffles is another scrumptious brunch option. The sweet jam and maple syrup work so well with the savory waffle and crispy seasoned chicken. The Niagara cherry jam really sets this dish apart from other variations I've tried elsewhere. I agree that the sweet and savory combination sounds a bit odd, but I assure you that it totally works and you'll come back to order it again and again."}
{"text":"I come here quite often it seems like a hotspot for out of towners I usually get good service but it  depends  on who you get! But the vibe and decor is good.. The coffee good and scones.... Goood!!! Try the patio upstairs in the summertime!"}
{"text":"Came by today at around noon for brunch. Waited for about 20 minutes for a table for two (would've been quicker if we had opted to sit outside on the patio).   We started with the warm scone share plate which came with cream and preserves for $8. The menu indicated that they were \"Toronto's best blueberry scones\" according to the Toronto Star. I must say, they are absolutely right! These were some of the most amazing scones I've ever had. They were nice and crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. The share plate came with 4 small scones and came with a vanilla cream, butter and preserves. This is highly recommended!  I also ordered the eggs benedict - 2 poached eggs, smoked pork loin, toasted english muffin, hollandaise + hand cut French fries ($12.75). The hollandaise had a very strong lemony flavour which I didn't enjoy at all since I'm not a huge fan of lemon. But, my boyfriend loved it. So, it really depends how you feel about lemon. Other than that, the eggs were perfectly poached and the smoked pork loin was nice. I also really enjoyed the fries which were nice and crispy.  My boyfriend ordered the Smoked brisket hash - fried eggs + chipotle cream ($14). The dish didn't look very appetizing, but hey, it's a hash. The eggs were cooked nicely but the meat was on the tough and dry side. Flavour-wise, the hash was decent, but not memorable.  As for the service, I found it to be a bit slow (I think they may have been short-staffed since it's the long weekend). It took us a pretty long time to get our coffee ($2.95 each) and it also took a while for us to flag someone down to get our bill.   Final thoughts? I'd come back to pick up some scones, but the rest of the food wasn't very memorable."}
{"text":"I guess working 8:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday has made me forget how awesome breakfast can be! I stayed at the Drake Hotel and had breakfast here twice and it was delightful both times. Their orange juice was so orange-y! Very refreshing. I also had their coffee, scones, home fries, and pancakes. All were a perfect way to start the day. I even had a bite of their peanut-butter maple bacon doughnut, which I think was a special treat they had that morning (the next morning they had birthday cake style doughnuts complete with candle). I like places that have fun with their doughnuts and amazing orange juice. Good job, Drake."}
{"text":"While I've never had dinner on the cafe side before, I think I'll go back. Was hoping to drop by for dinner in the main dining area but it was overtaken by a post holiday party.  That forced us onto the cafe side. I like The Drake even though I feel really uncool every time I go there with all the retro bohemians and their strategic piercings and tattoos. The cafe is basic --- a bit cramped. The dining chairs are more utility than comfort but the atmosphere is relaxed and casual --- just how I like it. Had the beef brisket + sides (3 sides come for a special price of around 20 bucks). Brisket was HUGE! Cooked homestyle but very flavourful. Get a side of Mac 'N Cheese and fries and you're all set for the night. With 1/2 litre of Red it cost about $60 tip in --- pretty good deal I'll say. Side benefit...cute artsy female types. +ives: relaxed dining, solid comfort food -ive: chairs, they're rock solid."}
{"text":"Overhyped. Overpriced. My Nicoise salad was subpar and our waiter was a tad snobby although very easy on the eyes. Pleasant substitute for the knowledge of spirits, I suppose. The moment someone challenges me on how to take my gin and tonic is the moment I question the integrity of said establishment.  Fortunately, the place is practically in my backyard, so it didn't feel like a paramount waste of time and resources. I'll check them out again and see if their garden patio fixes my initial impression."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with a few friends. Heard some good things about them few years ago and decided to try it out despite the super inconvenient location.  Here we go....the okays and the bads.....  Okays: The cafe was casual, pretty good hangout place for brunch with lots of natural light. Also the scone was really delicious, as many reviews have stated previously. We went with a group of 5 girls and they didn't decide to charge us for the scone in the end...not sure if it was too much of a hassle to split $3 on 5 bills...or whatnot..but hey, I'm not complaining.  Bads: Almost all of us ordered the Shakshuka, as it is something rarely seen on other brunch menus. The food was mediocre and the baked egg at the top of the skillet was almost rock hard from over baking. The thin pieces of baguette were horribly burnt and remained burnt even when I asked for them to be sent back... The price was not worth the quantity nor the quality.  Further what really irked me was we had made a reservation at 11:15 and at 12:30 the waitress came over to tell us we had about 5 minutes left before the next reserved table was set to arrive. I have never seen a restaurant allocate only 1 hour to each table before. The usual is 2. I was definitely not impressed with this.  Needless to say, despite the good (and free) scones, I will not be coming back...."}
{"text":"Coming on a weekend for brunch is pretty key here. The menu gets stepped up many notches, and is at the (relatively) affordable end of brunch in the neighbourhood. There isn't really anything on the brunch menu that you can go wrong with, though the drip coffee tends to be hit or miss.   The weekday lunch menu is decent in a reliable way, but the evening menu is decidedly meh. It kind of just feels like the lunch menu without the breakfast items and more expensive. That said, it's a good hangout option at any time of day, especially when the side patio opens up."}
{"text":"Why did you change your chicken and waffles from white meat to dark meat (with some gross skin/fat)?!!! You've lost a loyal customer. I ate there almost every weekend."}
{"text":"I've had a fair amount of brunch in Toronto from the east side to the west side, and Drake's eggs Benny is HANDS DOWN the worst I've ever had.  Poached eggs covered in a bland, soupy hollandaise sauce.  A measly portion of ham that under a blind taste test would appear to be a tasteless mystery meat. The less on your plate, the better  Mediocre, forgettable toast (and to think, the drake owns a bakery)  A big handful of greens covered in nothing but the taste of horseradish. Why horseradish?  NO HOMEFRIES. Not mandatory but kind of a staple to bennies for me so that's just the expired cherry on top.  All for an incredibly exorbitant sum of SIXTEEN %!?@ing dollars.  I know this review sounds over dramatic. But I'm not a brunch snob. All I know is no amount of salt or pepper or hot sauce could save that meal.   I feel cheated. Robbed.   Executive chef Ted Corrado do you even taste this brunch menu? Have you had your own eggs Benedict?   I'm only writing this so no one has the same experience my partner and I had.   With countless other incredible brunch spots in this massive city, don't settle for this subpar brunch-ripoff.  If you're hankering for breakfast food, you're better off making eggs and bacon at home and saving money.   From the bottom of my heart, you can do better."}
{"text":"Amazing it was like my mouth was being serenaded by spices and butter. I had some sort of lobster tails for app and I usually don't like lobster. and a steak. It was like I was in Europe again.  I only eat meat that comes from real farmers so this place only has their food from local farms."}
{"text":"Went for a quiet Family Day brunch with my partner. Hostess & guy server were great, but our regular server was just plain RUDE. MAJOR attitude. Why? Not the first time that service here has been spotty. The manager was not at all helpful, basically told us that we were nuts when we took the trouble to share our concerns with her.  I definitely think that guests deserve better. Do NOT go here, if respectful service is something you value!"}
{"text":"The food is really really fantastic! The breakfast was to die for. The beans/potatoes alone are worth going back for. Price wise, it's only ok - but the food is so good, I really didn't mind. Great ambiance too. The coffee was good and had free refills."}
{"text":"Brunch, outdoor patio, sangria, one of the best waffle and chicken. House made smoke salmon on cream cheese and bagel. Perfect compliments of pickles, red onions. Food is tasty, considerate, creative."}
{"text":"Zombie Brunch: False Advertising  We went with our kid and nieces expecting a Zombie Brunch, but the only Zombie-like thing was a couple of servers behind the bar wearing make up. There was no special decoration and no special items on the menu.  I checked on an old post about the Zombie Brunch from 2012, when there was a special menu and it certainly look more fun http://www.thedrake.ca/blog/2012/10/zombie-brunch-drake/  We live uptown and the only reason we went to The Drake was to have a Halloween experience we DID NOT have. We could have gone to any other restaurant since there was nothing special about this."}
{"text":"I wanna like this place a pantload, but both times I've come away feeling underwhelmed by my meal. Both times I've gleefully perused the menu (dinner and brunch), dewy sparkles of drool forming as I made a decision. Both times the written descriptions were much more delicious than the end product.  First let me say that the drinks and the atmosphere are excellent. I love having a nice sit here and ordering one caesar too many at 11am ($5 Caesars?! I'M ALL IN). I bet this joint is bangin' in the summertime.  Also the scones. The scones are definitely worth devouring.  And now back to the food. Meh meh meh. My brunch was better (scrambled eggs with a really nice accompanying salad, and I'm feelin the ricotta-topped toast), but overall I'm not racing back for more. The fish & chips were lackluster, but I shoulda known not to order them when not two days earlier I was eating fish & chips fresh off the boat in Nova Scotia. Yuh, I'm a total fish snob, so there.  All whining beside, the drinks/atmosphere/scones are worth returning for. I'll give the menu another go-round as well - I'm not hating, I'm just not raving!"}
{"text":"Met up with a few friends for a mid-week drink on the patio...  - This is definitely a nice, shaded patio to spend time on & the comfy booth benches are nice for a protracted evening.  - The white wine sangria is a lovely peach colour and has a nice not-too-sweet flavour. The only confusion with this was the reasoning behind the \"soapy\" tasting cherries - I am sure they have been soaked in something with good intentions, but their flavour was not a pleasant finish to my drink.  - For munching, I tried the red rice maki -it was a yummy, if over-priced, snack. Friends tried the fries and the tomato alphabet soup and were quite pleased.  Overall, I would go back in the evening at the request of a hipster friend but it would not be my first choice for a patio or culinary experience."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles were the best! Drake Benny and Drake Burger was great as well. Service was excellent. upstairs patio is where it's at!"}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes before our coffee came, but it only magically appeared when I asked the server where it was. Then I watched as the two tables who were seated the same time as us and ordered at the same time as us get their food. They were almost finished their meals before we got ours. We waited for 30 minutes for brunch. We didn't get an apology. I'll also note that the restaurant wasn't very busy, so the ratio between workers and customers was actually very high. The food was average brunch fare. Don't waste your time and money here when there are so many great places to eat on Queen West."}
{"text":"Happend to be in the area so I dropped in for breakfast with a friend. I counted at least 4 vacant tables but was told to put my my name on a waiting list and that the wait would be at least 20-30 mins. I was offered to sit at the bar if I wanted but didn't look very appealing. Sorry but I don't care how good the food may be, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We went to the Drake Cafe for brunch this weekend, having been there twice before.  Reservations are pretty much a must after 11:00, unless you're prepared to wait.  Service is great considering how busy they get and staff are hip and friendly. Now for the food. Fried chicken and waffles are ok, traditional 3 egg breakfast is just that...traditional.  They used to serve a dynamite jalapeno cheddar biscuit which is no longer on the menu, much to our dismay. Overall, the food is average but what makes the Drake for dining is the   large bustling patio and secluded, funky Sky Yard."}
{"text":"I just had the best burger in TO, and it was in this lovely restaurant with a patio, I had a salad instead of the fries, they do charge you for the exchange (weird), the salad was very light and green, the burger, I ordered medium rare, it melted in my mouth, the milk bun looks very fluffy, but as soon as you bite in to it you see it is very light, and delicious.  I had the wanderlust juice drink, it was really good, but at $8 I kinda wished it had some booze in it (which you can add for $3), I can't wait to go back and try more of their food. The service was pleasant, the food did took a very long time to come out."}
{"text":"Pretty damn disappointing! My wife and I had the Pan Seared Salmon $29 and the Drake Dry Aged Burger $19 on 9/25/16. The portion for the salmon was ridiculously small and there was nothing on that plate that justified the price. Getting angry thinking about it again (Gggrrrrrrrr!) The burger was nothing special. The fries were over cooked and very greasy; they were not edible. This place has gone downhill. Stay Away!  Other options in the hood: Beaconsfield, The Good Son, Union, Old School"}
{"text":"Had brunch here one Sunday. I ordered the dessert for breakfast, their pancakes! They were amazing! Maybe one of the best pancakes I've had, it was with this espresso sauce and fruit."}
{"text":"This is the hipster temple of Queen West. A bike frame chandelier runs the length of the bar. It's cool looking and cool feeling. So never mind the service is a dash slow (too slow for takeout coffee, though they try) and lineups stretch around the block on weekend mornings. It's The Drake!  Ordered the fried tomato sandwich today and it was absolutely delish. Some great vegetarian options, more than The Lakeview and cheaper than some other nearby hipster fare, though not by much.  A must-see if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I brought my bf's friends from out of town here for brunch in a Saturday morning. I called ahead to make reservations but they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 8 people. But the hostess advised that their busy times are between 12-1:30, so anytime before and after we wont have to wait long to be seated. we went at 11, so we were seated immediately.   We sat inside by the open windows. So we got the best of both worlds as it was forecast to rain (but didn't) and still enjoyed the warmth and the sunshine.   I got the blue berry scones that came with a infused butter and rhubarb and citrus jam.  Good call yelp reviews!  These are indeed the best scones in Toronto!   I ordered the eggs Benedict... It was served on a bagel. It wasn't huge but it was filling and it tasted great.   The friend's wife got egg whites with hashbrowns. Which she said was good, her regular breakfast.   The guys got the southern fried chicken and waffles. I wish I got this and now I'm craving it. The chicken is glazed with maple syrup I think and it was garnished with cherries. Great dish! They enjoyed it and I enjoyed the few bites I was able to steal!   The service is prompt and efficient. They were friendly and I will definitely be back again to order my own fries chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I had been to The Drake before with my best friends a few years back so I was pretty excited to bring my boyfriend here to try it. The best part was that it was a Friday and we had the entire place to ourselves.   My boyfriend and I decided to get the Drake breakfast and the chicken and waffles. We split everything which I always find is the way to go. The breakfast was great but if you go to The Drake you absolutely have to get their chicken and waffles. They are so epic! They put, and correct me if I am wrong, cranberry sauce over the chicken which adds a nice tartness to the mixture of sweet and savoury. So tasty.   The service was really prompt and courteous, but then again we were of the few that were there so one would expect to be treated well. I recommend The Drake for anyone that's looking for a great breakfast in Toronto."}
{"text":"Started off 2016 with brunch at the Drake's! A quaint corner cafe with an eclectic spin on classics. I got the smoked salmon bagels with eggs Benedict. Unlike most places, their salmon was chopped up and mixed with the cream cheese, providing a unique flavor texture combo. Yum! Treated myself with blueberry scones as dessert which were excellent. 2016 is off to a great start!"}
{"text":"Great diner atmosphere. A dialed in experience like the Drake in general. Love the art and bicycle frame lighting. Coffee and service is great. I was surprised that there are no dedicated vegan options on the menu. Even substitutions are very limited. Why no tofu to sub for eggs? However, the granola and fruit with soy milk instead of yogurt was very tasty. The bagel I had was not exciting (I'm from New Jersey and thus a bagel snob).  Add some good vegan options and you'll get five stars from me."}
{"text":"After dark or afternoon, Drake always comes through. Toronto Life calls it a \"hidden gem\" for brunch, perhaps because it isn't the first place that comes to mind?   I love Drake's brunch on many levels, starting with the fact they take reservations - a rarity for great Toronto brunch spots. Once there, service is always pleasant and whether you're seated in the cafe or the bistro, it's laidback.    I spent this beautiful Sunday morning with the chicest twosome I know - trust, there isn't another couple in Toronto that is more in vogue than these two. The three of us had a nice catch-up over a shared plate of Toronto's famed warm blueberry scones:     Flaky + sweet Simply sunhsine on a plate   Us ladies had Benedicts - Drake's traditional with pork loin, and their Caleb with smoked salmon:     The arugula (\"rocket\") was a nice touch.   The lone man had the Lumberjack:       Three eggs, sausage (or bacon), home fries, toast and buttermilk pancakes.  That's a mouthful...   This Sunday morning, no rain was falling; just a lovely day for three friends, brunch, and a stroll down Queen Street.  Parfait, j'aime ma vie."}
{"text":"Very crowded with interesting looking people. The foods is very good and so is the service. Great place to people watch."}
{"text":"Last time i have been enjoyed too much on Drake's Cafe. Is this place are great and fresh my mind. I ordered breakfast. The breakfast menu always like pizza. Its delicious.!! Guys you can visit this Cafe without any hesitate."}
{"text":"Was excited about trying this famous spot but left underwhelmed by the food. Lobster nachos & fried chicken were ok, grilled octopus not so great. Don't think the meal was worth the price."}
{"text":"I end up here a lot due to living in the area and I'm never too impressed.  The food is good, like not out of this world, but good. It is not, however, worth what they charge.  The low rating though is for the service. They continuously make you feel like they're doing you a favour. Our last brunch there, on a slow weekday, we waited 15 minutes to get menus. Waited another 10 for our drink order to be taken so we ended up ordering our meal at the same time. Our breakfast then came out before our drinks or cutlery. When we asked for both, my mother in law kindly mentioned we weren't  sure who to ask where our drinks were, because of another woman taking the order, and the current server made some comment how they work as a team. Fine, sounds good, but there is a weak link in your team if a table has to sit and wait 5 minutes for cutlery while their breakfast gets cold in front of them. We were then told our drinks were coming with out explanation or a simple \"sorry for the wait\". This is just one visit but it's basically what always happens. Just totally made to feel that they are doing is a favour by letting us pay $15 for bacon and eggs. Pretty over giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Been having breakfast there for the past few days and appreciate the service and the quality of the product. Very competent egg cookery and the pastry they are selling onsite looks delicious! Service also very helpful and friendly. Not exactly the cheapest venue but value for money."}
{"text":"Overpriced, esp. given the relatively low grade food, piss-poor service from a deaf waitress, as in literally deaf. No excuse for poor service. Wish I could expunge what I did waste money on."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast for my first, and last time at the Drake this past weekend. I ordered the ALT, but much to surprise, I got a little extra protein that I didn't ask for. That protein came in the form of a maggot.   It was hands-down the most disgusting thing I've seen in a restaurant. As someone who worked in the industry for a decade, I can honestly say I've never seen anything remotely comparable to this.   Do yourself a favour and check your food before you eat it...you never know what you're going to get!"}
{"text":"Went there twice and had great experiences. The sandwiches and soups were very good. They are friendly and to sit outside in the summer of Toronto is such a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Considering I go here almost every weekend for brunch, I would have to rate The Drake a solid 5 stars! I've never stayed in the hotel, but the brunch is to die for! The blueberry scones are amazing, the breakfast burrito is great (w/added sausage), and the chicken and waffles are amazing! It's easy to rack up a bill though. If you're frugal, a bill for two is about $40 and if you get the scones to start and alcoholic drinks and coffee, you're looking at an easy $70 for breakfast, so be aware! The service is great too though! Everyone is super friendly and down to earth... Hipster central and I love it! :)"}
{"text":"Big open windows letting in the warm slanting afternoon sunlight, crisp witbier from one of my favorite breweries, and an undeniably solid salad.  Add some free wi-fi and a date with my e-mail inbox and you have the makings of a charming, comfortable, and capable café.  This is the first time I've tried Unibroue's Blanche de Chambly - I'm a fan!  Now I just need to figure out where to find it retail near me at home... having had their Noir de Chambly in Boston about a year ago, I had a hunch that the lighter style would be right up my alley.  Who would have guessed the Québécois knew how to brew?  My sashimi salad had plenty of generous cuts of fish, and it wouldn't have surprised me if each leaf of crunchy lettuce on the plate had been hand-selected for perfection; not a single leaf was wilted or soggy.  Sometimes, it's the simple things that make all the difference."}
{"text":"I've been on a mission to try different brunch places. This Sunday we went to check out the Drake.  It's super busy so my recommendation is to make a reservation beforehand; if you can. Otherwise be prepared to wait for a bit. You can request to sit at the bar as well to try and get seated earlier. The vibe of the place is energetic with lots of people flowing in and out of the restaurant. The place has an old school diner feel to it, but a bit more modern and eclectic.  The bartender was friendly and efficient; my only critique would be that I wish the coffee was refilled.  We ordered the blueberry scone plate and the Lumberjack. After reading the reviews on here I wanted to try the scones. The scones are served with cream cheese, preserves, butter, and fresh berries. The scones were not too sweet and flaky, but I found them a little hard. You definitely need a coffee or a tea to go with scones. I got a regular tea that came in a cool tea bag. I enjoyed the preserve that was served with the scones. The Lumberjack is a large portion of food consisting of 3 eggs, apple and sage sausage, home fries, pancake, and maple syrup. I loved the sausage. The sausage was cooked perfectly; the apple and sage complimented each other. The bacon was cooked the way I like it; not too crispy. This along with the scones was definitely enough for 2 people to share."}
{"text":"The Drake is horrible. The food is so insanely overpriced and it's not bc I'm cheap, it's bc the food isn't good. Last time I was there we sent half of what we ordered back, something w watermelon in it and a lobster dish. Inedible. Shitty condescending waiters and a bunch of uncool patrons. It's great for smokers tho and if you're waiting for the Beaconsfield across the street to open up."}
{"text":"Kind of a beautiful place to end up for a weekend brunch.  I've come here a few times and love the ambience every time.  The narrow room has a nice kitchen crossed with bistro feel.  and the patio is nice when the sun comes directly upon it.   the breakfasts are tasty but not spectacular in value or quality.  But definitely worth an a-ok rating.  The pastries are beautiful and made in-house.  The scone is supposed to be really good- I tend to hate scones but my dining partner said they were a \"taste-explosion\".  The croissant, also made in-house was less than spectacular.  Not buttery or flakey ENOUGH to get a good rating from me.  I also tend to hate croissants unless they are perfect (i.e. Brassai- or next-to-perfect- Carousel bakery @ St. Lawrence).  Great place but I, personally, am not charmed by it."}
{"text":"Decent food but too slow and inattentive (a la Queen West hipster apathy). Over-trading on the name and hype for too long now. Time to get over yourself and step up your game Drake. I'd love to enjoy coming here again sometime."}
{"text":"Love this place it's always a hit!  From the blueberry scones and the cappuccino to the breakfast burrito swap the cheese to goat cheese with extra guac and salsa pure heaven!   The service is fantastic! The atmosphere is chill and all around great!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, delectable food and free WiFi. Do you really need anything more? I spent several hours here each day I was visiting Toronto since I was staying in the attached Drake hotel. The first time I settled in, I'd just been told it would be 4 hours before I could enter my hotel room and armed with little more than my laptop I prepared for the long wait. Despite my hogging a table for 3 plus hours and ordering little more than a latte, the waiters and waitresses were downright jolly. They never bothered me and simply made themselves available if needed.   Beyond the service the food is excellent. I had an incredible bagel with cream cheese & lox that had an amazing mixed lettuce, capers and paper thin slices of red onion sandwiching perfect slices of smoked salmon. The lattes are potent and the caesar I sprung for (when in Canada!) was well done...though I'm not quite used to that clamato aftertaste.   The pain of an 11am room check out time is certainly eased by it's existence and I do believe it's the cafe all others should hope one day to be."}
{"text":"Chicken. and. Waffles. The end.   JK.  Walked in on Sunday morning at 10a and snagged a table for 2, no problem. I think the key is to show up before they start serving alcohol, because that's when most people begin brunching.   Don't get me wrong, the place was busy and our server definitely had her hands full. We had to ask for refills on coffee etc, but that sort of stuff doesn't bug me.   Back to the food. The chicken and waffles is one of the best things I have eaten in Toronto ever. The herbed waffle is fluffy, with just enough crust to stand up to the syrup. The chicken is all white meat, the breading has the perfect texture and savoriness. The syrup is sweet and tart, and what really makes this stand out from other chicken and waffle offerings. I would also like to say that the chicken to waffle ratio was spot on. I am not proud of it, but I ate the whole dang plate.   What I loved about this dish is it's ability to hit on so many flavor notes- sweet, salty, savory, tart and be so well balanced. I have to stop, my mouth is watering.   Hubby had the eggs benny and loved them. He offered me a bite, but well...I was busy.  Dear other items on the Drake brunch menu: I'm sorry I will never order you because I will always worry that you won't be as good as the chicken and waffles.   XO, Erica"}
{"text":"Nice spot for Sunday brunch. It was pretty busy when we came in. Had the chicken and waffles which was amazing huge portion."}
{"text":"Four words to ecstasy: Milk Chocolate Passionfruit Pudding.  I could go on about how luscious and dreamy this pot of heaven was; sweet and tart with a thickness unlike any pudding I've had. Honestly though, describing this pudding's ethereal qualities is sort of like trying to explain to someone what kissing feels like.   Some things are better left to experience."}
{"text":"Superb!! I'm kind of blown away by the deliciousness of the breakfast I just had (I had the Drake Breakfast and asked them to make it vegetarian and they added kale and mushrooms- yum!) the service was so friendly and lovely! I'm a huge fan of the drake cafe!"}
{"text":"The Drake has great Brunch and very good service.  The coffee on the other hand is awful.  Do yourself a favor and order a beverage other than coffee and you should be fine :)"}
{"text":"The soup I ate here was so freaking delicious. In the winter there's nothing quite like a bowl of piping hot, hearty and/or rich soup and that's exactly what the Drake served up to me during our stop in here. I also had fries (you really have to try to mess up fried potatoes) and a salad that were both good.  While we originally stopped in to dine in the breakfast area they let us in to the bigger restaurant portion as it was opening at 11 and offered us that menu, which did feature two breakfast items on it. So if you are looking for a later breakfast in the area this isn't a bad spot to stop in to."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot in the West End! I loved the coffee and the staff was great. Constantly refilling my coffee without asking. I ordered the breakfast sandwich because i was intrigued by the combination of avacado and pork belly! You must try this with their habanero sauce! Actually you can probably have the sauce with anything because it was that good! I would definitely come back here and try the other breakfast items and also the lunch meals. Great little cafe for some quiet time, or catch up with a friend!"}
{"text":"So we were looking for a place for brunch and thought we'd check this out since they had an outdoor patio.  It was closed but we went inside to ask only because we had our little doggy with us.  The host said that the patio was closed but went to ask someone else.  She came back and said that it was ok.  They opened up the patio just for us!  Very impressed that the went out of their way and sent two of the waiters outside to unlock all the table/chairs and wiped them down.  Now that's customer service!  We sat at the end near the door and our doggy was able to sit just on the outside of the patio. They provided us a bowl of water for our dog which was really nice.  The bathroom inside was clean, unisex and big.  Breakfast was great and came out fairly fast.  The rosemary sausage was amazing.  and so was the raspberry jams.  They kept our water/coffee cups full.  Great food, great service.  Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Cool spot in a trendy neighborhood! Loved my caramel latte and avocado toast. Plus great service !"}
{"text":"I found the portions quite small for all the dishes we ordered.   Food is decent but not out of this world and when you factor the price ($15-$16 for the dishes we ordered), the good atmosphere and service could not make this one of my go to places.  However the place is quite busy so I'm sure many people may dispute me.  Not saying it's a bad place but found it expensive for the food/portion size."}
{"text":"AMAZING cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich and I will most definitely come back for the food...but the service was lacking just a little bit. It was between breakfast and lunch shifts so maybe they were a little short-staffed? We had to walk into the bar area a couple of times to ask for more water/our check/silverware but the food was just so amazing it negated the lack of attention from our waiter. Highly recommended for the atmosphere, cheddar biscuits (that they bake themselves each day) and fresh fruit salad."}
{"text":"A number of advantages to this almost hipster style diner cafe tucked in the corner.   Very good service...things taken in the right order, efficient, accommodating and polite.  Food...excellent breakfast options including a surprisingly delicious fried chicken and waffles, really delicious blueberry scones with mascarpone cheese, butter and jam. The soft and sexy scrambled eggs with mushrooms was also solid. The coffee could use a little work but otherwise a comfy dining location.  I'll be visiting again if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a holiday and had to make sure they were serving brunch. Starts at 9 they say.  The brunch menu looks a lot better than the breakfast menu, understandable I guess.  The duck confit hash was delicious. One poached egg deep fried with a heaping portion of duck and what's supposed to be ham but looks like bacon! It also has this pickled thing that I guess is celeriac, taste delicious. The hash itself was like a potato hash pancake but it was a bit chewy instead of crispy. That for me could have been better.  The eggs benny had ham but tasted a bit like bacon. That was also a great taste in my mouth. The lemon in the hollandaise was quite clear in taste profile.  The service was nice. The muffin was delicious too. They have all those condiments you see at the commissary, but not the zucchini bread.  The one thing that I could tell was not right was they said they were starting at 9 serving brunch, but the food took a while. And a table that came like 20min after us got their food really fast after us. If the kitchen is not ready, please tell me. I may not leave, and I also might. But I deserve to know I feel."}
{"text":"Hit this place up while I was waiting for some friends.  Decided after taking a looooong subway ride I needed something cool.  It was pretty empty around 6pm-ish so I basically had the entire inside of the cafe to myself.  Service was nice and everyone was friendly.    Clean, quirky and a pretty decent sized patio this place I am sure gets packed later in the evening.  Great place to sit on the patio in the evening and just people watch.  Haven't tried any of the food items here so looking forward to that next time I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"The vibe: Great looking cafe and patio inside the swanky and cool Drake Hotel. The people watching here is pretty top notch, which is a bonus. It's a great spot to come for brunch with some girl friends, since there are some big tables and the service is accommodating and patient.   The food: Although the prices aren't bad, there aren't many dishes on the menu that wow me. The best thing I've had for brunch was the blueberry stacks with the lemon curd and ricotta. Perfection. If all their meals tasted this good I'd give them a higher review. I've had the vegetarian sandwich, which was great, and friends tried the salads, which were both OK. The quality of the food is good, but it isn't amazing.   My go to meal: Blueberry stacks  Secret: A great spot for people watching."}
{"text":"It was good!  There. Done. Long-winded review is as follows: Restaurant was rather dead on a Wednesday at 7:30... to be expected though I guess. Our server was kinda creepy, not gonna lie. Octopus appetizer was out of this world. Tender, flavourful! Grilled Romain Salad was so many different textures, tastes, and elements.  Very enjoyable. Prompt service, great meal."}
{"text":"Incredibly small portions, the shakshuka was one egg in  a a tiny bowl and wasn't spiced properly, added greens was about 12 leaves for 6 dollars!"}
{"text":"After a long trek to the Drake Hotel from Eaton Centre (traffic was horrible), my two friends and I finaly make it there.  It was the three of us, and we got seated in about 10 minutes after sitting on a little couch to determine what kind of food we wanted to have that night.  We ordered the following: 1) BC SMOKED OYSTERS: with some grilled bread and radish, this was an interesting meal.  I usually don't eat oysters, but it was absolutely decliious.  I was a little bit confused about why they gave us canned BC smoked oysters - I still can't tell if they actually just took it out of the can or it was just presentation.  Nonetheless, it was a greally great appetizer to start.  2) FRIED SESAME SQUID: with kimchi!? and charred scallion aioli.  The calamari was a bit disappointing, I wasn't very impressed.  Adding kimchi to the dish threw it off (and not only that... the kimchi wasn't that good).  The aioli sauce was really good though - but I wouldn't really recommend this dish.  3) BEEF CARPACCIO: tenderloin, flatbread, and arugula.  This was my favourite appetizer to start off with.  The mix of the truffle oil with the flatbread and the tenderloin was just absolutely amazing.  Definite commendrecommend.  4) CRAB SPAGHETTI SUCCOTASH:  my friend ordered this; we don't know how it was; but I guess she had no complaints.. So I guess it was good.  5) TUNA TATAKI:  my friend and I shared this (we went to Taste of Danforth prior to this; so sharing three apps and then this was REALLY filling).  Lightly seared with ginger, sesame, etc. -- It was actually really good!  I would recommend this in future instances.  Service wasn't bad either - the people were friendly and what not.  I initially found our waitress to be slightly annoyed of us probably because we were taking forever to order; but as time passed by, she grew on me.   Great place to hang out with some people on a Friday evening after work."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ate out on the patio because of the nice weather but it got windy real quick and i ended up getting lots of leaves and impurities in my drink :(  The scones are a must! Super flaky and buttery. And their homemade jam?! YUM :) Also for the croque Monsieur which was served with a leaf salad. Good portion size and the sandwich was super crispy. Pretty pricey but food I had was good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"So, I came here for their après work deal. $6-10 sushi and cocktails.  I was quite impressed.  The sushi was amazing. Mine was basic, just salmon, cucumber, & avocado. I loved it.  Then I had their Kahlo cocktail.  O.M.G.  Sultry with mezcal which I loved. Agave nectar & other ingredients I don't remember. My oh my, what an amazing drink. And it snuck up on me super quick.   Atmosphere cute. The lounge was cute as well, but an event was taking place. I wanted a more chill area to read & space out while enjoying my meal.  Love.  Service was slow at first though -_-  Will come back. Service better be better..."}
{"text":"Cool looking place with an interesting menu.. but slowwwww, unattentive service.. so many other choices nearby , consider somewhere else if you're on even a shred of a schedule."}
{"text":"Intense yoga followed by brunch on Queen West is my weekend ritual and I've been working my way through all the various brunch spots on this strip. This week, I decided to try the Drake Corner Cafe. The side patio is lovely on a sunny day with lots of umbrellas for those who prefer the shade. We arrived at 11:30 and were seated right away.   I started with some fresh mango juice - refreshing and sugary sweet. Then my DC and I shared a plate of those famous blueberry scones. Believe the hype. They were divine -- everything a scone should be: warm, soft, a bit of crispness on the outside, granulated sugar sprinkled on top, dense but not dough-y, and triangular. The 4 mini scones were served with strawberry jam, butter, and clotted cream. It felt like going for high tea. I also had the yogurt and homemade granola with honey and fruit to round out the meal. The yogurt was plain yogurt (I would've preferred vanilla), but the granola was surprisingly crisp and flavourful with a variety of nuts.   Service was smooth and swift, no complaints. I would come back to try the rest of the menu. The breakfast burrito, especially, sounds really good. I was also intrigued by the make-your-own mimosas and caesars on the menu."}
{"text":"The vibe is great, the servers are awesome, and the food is decent. Drake's is part boutique hotel, part bistro, part dive, part cafe.... it is super cute and somehow works well no matter what the concept. Queens West is ones of the cutest neighborhoods I've visited in Toronto, and that's due largely in part to gems like Drake's. The place offers a full bar, and eclectic menu and free wifi.  During my visit, it was neither busy nor packed. I noticed that most people were there alone, sipping coffee and checking their phones, quietly reading, or working away on their laptops... I enjoyed the lively scene, and how it is was somehow still pretty quiet inside. I easily found a table next to the window near two people holding a business meetup. I unpacked my macbook and got to work over hot coffee, fresh salmon, eggs and warm bread.   Stayed for hours. Got a ton done. Enjoyed myself. It was a great day."}
{"text":"Get the scones!!! The preserves, butter and vanilla they give you compliment it very well. Be warned, the portions are quite big.   Good place to get brunch. Free street parking before 1pm on sundays i think."}
{"text":"Aw man, if I lived in Toronto I think I'd have to take up residence at the Drake Hotel...more specifically, the Drake Corner Cafe. Even though I just finished my breakfast here mere hours ago, I have absolutely burned it in my brain as some of the best pancakes, evar. Evaaaaar. And this girl knows her pancakes/hotcakes/griddle cakes/flapjacks.   The cafe itself is just plain lovely. You'll spy plenty of patio space, an eclectic menu with something for a variety of tastes and quick, friendly service. After my decaf latte arrived it took me all of .2 seconds to order up the Short Stack: three sizable fluffy pancakes, topped with blueberries, blueberry drizzle and a small but sassy scoop of mascapone. Oh, and do not forget the coating of lemon curd in between the pancakes. Are you drooling yet? Because you should be.  It's not a cheap meal - pancakes were $12.95, latte was $4 but I enjoyed it so thoroughly. It was a beautiful breakfast and one that I plan to repeat (read:eat) during a future visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I was there in May 2015 for Canadian Music Week to meet a colleague for a showcase taking place in the Drake Underground.  I arrived and joined my colleague on the patio.  There were only three tables occupied on the patio, and what appeared to be a private event inside, and maybe 6 servers or so.  Three servers gossiped around the POS, while I tried to make eye-contact.  It took 20 minutes for a server to come over and ask if I wanted a drink, while my colleague downed his beer.  When I finally received a pint, it wasn't very cold, and I had to drink it quickly to make it to the showcase on time.  I've experienced better service at The Drake in the past, and was disappointed in my first visit to their cafe."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Ambience is nice and relaxed, people who work here are friendly and happy, always a good sign. Good for a weekend brunch if you're not too hungry. Good coffee, decent food. Only peeve is that food takes a while to prep. I've been here twice during low traffic times and they have been slow."}
{"text":"Went there for the \"Seafood Sunday\" special they were starting this month. Friendly service and nice ambiance but the food was very average in presentation and taste. I might give it another try but not recommending as a must."}
{"text":"The Drake is always a good time...from the underground to the rooftop. The main part of the restaurant was closed when we went, and the roof was also closed for an event so we ate outside on the patio. It was a gorgeous night, so we happily obliged. I have to start this by talking about our server Tyler, he was AWESOME! So friendly from walking us through the menu, to telling us all about the Drake itself, Toronto, and everything in between. He even brought us mugs of hot water when it got chilly outside. Make sure you ask for him when you eat there, he rocks. The food was really good, my highlight items were; lobster nachos, the salmon, short rib, and flourless chocolate torte. If you get the chance, definitely hit up the roof for a drink."}
{"text":"Loved this place - beautiful morning even though it was really windy - sitting on patio was fabulous! Coffee was great - breakfast was off the charts good especially threat fried chicken thigh!!! And the servic was awesome - so friendly and real! Lasted to end the meal! Go there you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive staff, great cappuchinos, and good food! The place is nicely decorated, with lamps made out of bicycle parts, and has a cool vibe to it.  My friend and I had the eggs benedict and the Drake breakfast. I do not understand the complaints about the small portion sizes - we could not even finish our dishes before we were completely full!   Nice place for brunch, and to hang out on a friday afternoon. Will be back to try their sangria!"}
{"text":"Check it! This is easily one of the most vibrant breakfast experiences I've ever had. Vibrant? Yeah, I said it. Expansive windows, vibrant colours and shiny metals make this place an instant \"wake-me-up,\" offereing a fresh feel in a histroic setting. Service was spot on during a recent brekkie trip... our server was full of awesome suggestions for eats, and a loose leaf tea rec that packed some mad flavor. As for the food, super simple - egg whites scambled, toast, avocado, tomato and a small salad, but super delicious. I can't remember an avocado tasting this creamy good, and here's a quick idea of you want to make the perfect bite: Slice up that tomato to fit your toast, shmear some avocado as you would cream cheeese, load the bad boy up with some egg and you are good to go! A wifi situation makes it easy to work, and even though they have limited seating at tables, they weren't quick to rush me or my bud Chad G during a recent laptop sesh. I dig the vibe, the staff, the wifi, pretty much every single bit about the place!"}
{"text":"The Drake reminds me of the Ace Hotels stateside. Chic, boutique hotel that's super hip and a place to be seen at. In fact, I'm a little torn with my rating. The place certainly gets plus points for style. It's completely instagram-worthy and anyone that's a style and design lover ought to check out its premises. The food was also quite good. I came for a quiet lunch and enjoyed my food and my time there. Food is a tad pricey but delicious. I imagine, if I lived in Toronto it would be the kind of place I'd come meet a date for cocktails. A venue you start at but ultimately go elsewhere for a foodie-worthy meal. So food was average at 3 stars but over all the experience and setting lends to a higher rating."}
{"text":"Douchey hipster service.  Average coffee. Very unimpressive overall. On the bright side kinda reminds me of the cafe from seinfeld"}
{"text":"This place has a wicked patio and is filled with beautiful, hip people.  That's about all it has, though.  The food presentation is excellent but totally underwhelming in taste and overpriced.  A burger here is $17 bucks and tastes pretty average.  The burger down the street at Queen Star is bigger, tastier, and 5 bucks.  Other items on the menu are similarly meh and pricey, but it is a pretty cool hangout spot, which I think is what you are paying for."}
{"text":"I spend just about every day here, and I love it. The food is always amazing, you can hang out there all day on your laptop, and it's great for meeting friends."}
{"text":"Love the place. Been there many times with the wife and kids for sunday brunches. Food is great, especially the eggs benedict and the breakfast burrito. Also the waffles are great. Pretty decent coffee as well. All in all a real favourite in Toronto. The live music is also great.  If anything they could maybe do a couple of updates to the menu. Couple of the items are pretty plain. Especially the eggs and bacon. Its just that at a place like this you expect a bit more creativity even with stuff like that."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch recently and I thought the food was great!!  I had the herb waffle with the southern fried chicken.  It came with creme fraiche and Niagara stewed cherries. The waffles were rich and the chicken was crispy on the outside with a lovely maple flavouring and the meat inside was tender and juicy.  We all got mimosas, which hit the spot, however, it would be awesome if they had a bottomless mimosa option.  Although, they probably would not have been able to get us out of there.  Everyone else at the table also enjoyed their meals.  One of my friends had the eggs benny and my husband and other friend had the burrito.  I heard no complaints!  Oh and we had the blueberry scones to share and they were as good as a scone in Ireland.  My favourite part was that it came with vanilla bean clotted cream which was sooo decadent.  Totally need to go back for brunch!  The prices were reasonable and the servings are adequate.  My only complaint was that the service was on the slow side and they need to break out the heat lamps as it can feel nippy on the patio these days."}
{"text":"Ordered the Drake Burger today. It was on some promotion, so I received fries and a burger for almost half price ($10) compared to their original $18.   The burger came with double cooked fries. Really tender, cooked well, enough salt :D  The burger itself had Russian dressing, Perth bacon, and cheddar cheese. The burger was cooked medium rare - my favorite! No filler at all. Just straight pure beef. Very smoky, nicely charged and grilled on the outside, very juicy on the inside. Drove to get it take out, arrived home after 15 minutes and it was still really good.   I would definitely recommend a try. I think $20 for this burger is a fair price but perhaps expensive for some. There are definitely cheaper burgers out there. I mean if you prefer the modern take on the burger (Holy Chuck, Burger's Priest) or 50's diners burger (Diary Freeze, Jumbo Burger, Apache etc...) It's all up to you but if this burger is indication of the rest of their food, then this is a must return kind of place.   I am excited to see the rest of their food..."}
{"text":"I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts diddly dee... hold on to your seats coconut ice cream lovers, this place is the shit!  Yesterday was a bad combination of blistering heat and an impromptu walk to work (damn you 501 Queen and F*ck you too 29 Dufferin). I needed something good to boost up with my impending bad mood. With no shoe store or cupcake eatery in sight I thought all was lost and then I saw Drake Scoop +Tees *cue heavenly \"ahhhhh\"*  As you might already guessed, this place sells... t-shirts and ice cream (I know... they should have been more straight forward with their name!) I walked in they the adorable scoop girl asked if I wanted to try any flavours. COCONUT I WANT COCONUT is what I \"calmly\" exclaimed! It was magical and I immediately wanted a cone... then I saw the toppings. Graham cracker crumbs mixed with butter?! BRING IT ON!  Honestly I didn't even leave the store and I had pretty much finished my cone, while browsing through their small collection of hipster silk screened tees.   This place is gonna be dangerous...yummy, yummy danger!"}
{"text":"Drake's is an awesome place for brunch especially on a sunny day when the patio is open!  I love how you can find sunny and shaded area on their huge patio..  Now I think all I care about is the nice patio..  And of course having a drink or 2 helps?! Apricot Frizz ($9) is light and refreshing. Now I think all I care about is the drink..  I ordered Wild Blueberry + Ricotta Pancakes ($11.95) is OK, but probably won't order that again..  I tried Southern Fried Chicken + Waffles ($14) Savour+Sweet at the same time  Services are casual and friendly... love the laid back vibe..   Isn't it that what I want on a Sunny Summer afternoon? Laid back and enjoy a drink with my friends! :)"}
{"text":"The arugula and radish salad I had today was a touch uninspired (c'mon, throw in some pumpkin seeds or other crunchies to mix it up) but the crostini and cream cheese on the side livened up the mood a little.   It was the bite of Miriam W's milk chocolate and pomegranate pot de creme that sent me into a tantalizing tizzy the likes of which I haven't experienced since first biting into Terroni's flourless chocolate cake. It was just so good that one bite was enough to slap a grin on my face. I can't imagine how blissed out I'd be after eating an entire ramekin's worth!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious lunch in a nice environment on a weekday, look no further than Drake's Corner Café and Bistro. Sure, the cool kids might tell you to come here for weekend brunch or not hit the hotel in the day at all, but trust me, this Bistro makes a bonkers lunch, and the lovely staff don't mind if you stick around with your laptop.   Things I love on their menu: +Avocado toast with lobster (I am not normally an avocado lover, it's more of a guac) +Chicken and waffles +Eggplant sandwich +Caesar (for drinking, duh)"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Drake on a recent wekeend trip out to Toronto and had a fantastic time.  Amazing hotel.  Grabbed brunch at this spot both Saturday and Sunday and didn't leave disappointed.  Had the homemade granola both times along with a sampling of their various scones and croissants.  All were good.  Fresh juice, good coffee and tried the GF's pancakes with thyme ricotta the last day.....some of the best I've had."}
