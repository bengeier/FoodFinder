{"text":"I've been here twice once with the old menu and then they just introduced a new menu.  The first go was solid but unspectacular a sold C+.  The tacos were good, and so were the margaritas, my wife particularly liked their frozen margarita (which she is really picky about).  It was a challenge with kids because on the original menu there was not a kids menu.  Which I get and probably wasn't the best idea to bring them but they were able to put together cheese quesadillas on corn tortillas and chips and salsa.  Service was solid and would have given it 3 stars overall.  On our visit tonight we were excited to give it another shot because they revamped the menu and added kids items.  The margaritas were very different then the first go around.  First trip they were made with fresh ingredients and tasted good.  This time the margaritas were filled to the brim and above in some cases with ice and they were made with heavy sweet and sour - reminded me of something you would get at chilis.  My wife couldn't get the frozen one because the machine was broken.    The first course we used a coupon for the green chili cheese crisp which I would give 4 stars, the second course we ordered 3 kids meals: 2 bean and cheese burritos and a cheese quesadilla.  We had shrimp tacos and fish tacos and another family member order the burrito.  The kids specifically say on the menu: item+fries+small drink.  the burritos were served with avocado, lettuce and sliced tomatoes on the side.  The kids quesadilla came with black beans and rice.  The beans were a nasty dried mush and over salted.  The kids burritos were huge filled with the same black beans.  No fries were brought with the meals. Again I understand certain restaurants don't want to accommodate kids but then why the hell change your menu?  When asked the server why they made the burritos with black beans he said they don't have any other types.  So I grabbed a menu pointed out that refried beans is a side dish!  He told me that was weird because they don't even have those in the kitchen.  I said well the kids really don't like these so they are not going to eat them.  And responded by saying \"well I can go back and see if we have some OLD pintos beans or something and remake them?\"  Now I was getting annoyed so I politely asked him to take them off the bill.  He replied they just put the new menu in and the kitchen staff doesn't know how to make everything yet.  Fish tacos, shrimp tacos were a joke!  They brought out tortillas the size of a silver dollar.  I love street tacos and the original trip we had the tortillas were excellent but these were half the size.    Overall I say this places is going downhill and fast.  I saw someone in the kitchen staff playing on his phone and caught one of the servers snacking on chips out of the bin!  I hope here hands were clean!!! There aren't many reviews on yelp and that's because the place is empty.  Word of mouth travels fast there are far better places to go in Chandler and the rest of the valley.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"The Living Room is my favorite restaurant in Arizona so I was excited to try La Sala and was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. It was a Thursday night and service was SO SLOW. Server didn't even take my finished drink for 30 minutes when I had a fresh drink in front of me already. Small table so had no room. The tacos were terrible. Honestly the most boring/gross thing I've ever had and there was hardly any meat/fish/etc in it. The salsa was decent, the guac tasted like it was out of a container from Costco, as did the chips.  Also, ordered their house margarita but was told they can make it with flavors so I ordered a raspberry margarita... it tasted like they poured cough syrup in it. Will never return, way better Mexican restaurants than that everywhere in America but ESPECIALLY in ARIZONA"}
{"text":"Ordered enchiladas, they didn't resemble an enchilada, came in iron skillet looking like a glob of cheese with a few pieces of dry chicken on top and no tortilla in sight. I was told they are in there somewhere.  It tasted terrible. if their going to make dishs, they need tell the customer what they getting.Dinner for two $60. Definitely Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with this new menu - great service and location was perfect. There is so many more options now and they are out of this world"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a Mission type restaurant in Chandler, boy was I disappointed!! I went the first week it was open and the service was awful. The server didn't even know what the food was that he brought us. Ceviche is pretty easy to recognize.  The food was good but was not hot. The tacos were good just overpriced.  Overall I wasn't impressed, but I always give new places time to get their act together. So I went back last week, on Thursday around 5.  There was one guy at the bar and no one else. Not sure how they are going to make it without customers, but ok. So on with the review.  The menu has completely changed after a couple months of being open.  I didn't think the taste was bad before.  I tried the green chili stew, don't bother, very forgettable.  For the main entree I had the brisket taco platter.  First thing I noticed was the dried food on my plate.  One of the others in my party has the same issue.  You would think with no customers they could at least clean the plates properly! Well the food was ok, at least this time it was to temperature. The service was good but not great. There were a lot of bodies there but not much work going on. Overall. Mediocre on food and service.  I won't be back.  There go my hopes for a good Mexican bistro in C-town."}
{"text":"What a difference good service makes! I was here a few months ago and we had 3 or 4 different people waiting on us, our orders got mixed up and we were left sitting without any help for a while which was frustrating. So second time back was MUCH better! Sat at the bar, bar tender was great! Margarita and tacos were awesome! Got the Nom margarita, shrimp, brisket and carnitas tacos. Shrimp taco was amazing! Brisket and carnitas tacos were great... can't decide which was better. I will be back (Schwarzenegger voice)!"}
{"text":"Some friends told us about this place. We were happy to hear that there was a good Mexican restaurant in our neighborhood. They had enjoyed their meal so we decided to give it a try. Upon arriving we were greeted with a friendly face and were seated right away in a comfortable booth. A pleasant waitress came over right away to ask us about drinks and offer chips. We really liked the complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were warm with a lovely chipotle salsa on the side. Refills were cheerfully given. My husband had a beer and I had a skinny Margarita, one of the better skinny drinks I have had. Entrees: I had two tacos and a side of guacamole. The guac was very nicely flavored and the tacos were very good - chicken and pork carnitas. My husband tried the chimichanga and loved it. It was accompanied by rice and beans, which were both quite good. He could only eat half of his dinner since the portion was large, but he was excited to bring it home to have for lunch the next day. Wait staff and other employees came by our table frequently to see if we needed anything. We will definitely be coming here again, and soon!"}
{"text":"I like this place, the food, and the staff.  I have one big problem, which is being charged a different price than what the menu says.  Went there 2 Fridays in a row, once happy hour, once later.  Both times I was charged more than the menu price for my beer.  Tonight was bottled domestics.  Charged $5, menu said $4.  No, it was not a happy hour menu.  Bartender was new to the location and handled it poorly when i questioned him.  I've been here twice and was overcharged both times.  I can't recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  Unique chips for the yummy salsa - splurge on the refill!  Highly recommend the spicy watermelon cocktail to get started. The beer is also Ice cold and perfect.  Also loved the veggie tacos featuring goat cheese and mushrooms on mini tortillas.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just tried this new restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it. Our food came out (cold) before the appetizer. It's pretty expensive for the amount of food but the biggest disappointment is you have to pay for chips and salsa. That is very unusual for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent - we both ordered taco platters and the food was delicious !  The carnitas was juicy and tender and the brisket was full of flavor.  I read the previous bad reviews of their rice and ordered black beans instead but my husband liked the rice and pinto beans as his two sides.  We went for lunch last sunday and would go back again.  Service was attentive and our food arrived quickly.  We both liked the placement of the taco protein on the side because you decide how big or small you want your taco to be."}
{"text":"This place is great! The chips come out hot, the salsa is great tasting but not to spicy. We had a couple of taco plates that tasted great and offered way to much food (you could easily share). The margaritas will make your mouth water, and the service was great!  I'm looking forward to trying some additional items, all the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here. I liked the Fajitas but they were not amazing. The staff was okay. I was confused about the set up with the dual restaurants. There was no host either. Expensive though even with the groupon."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here today - first visit. Attentive & friendly staff. Very good salsa but the Tacos are the stars here. Brisket taco w/ pickled shallots? Yes please. Their meat is fire/wood grilled and you can taste it. Fabulous! Wonderful food, $9 lunch deals. A real bargain for this fine fare."}
{"text":"Ambience: Walking into this restaurant, it feels very western with a modern feel. Very nicely done. Intimate lighting, comfortable booths, nice seating. The bar was also put together very nicely.   Customer Service: It's a seat yourselves concept. The waitress/hostess explained that to us as soon as we walked in. She was really sweet. Overall it was just ok. It was a slow night and the staff definitely took there time and there wasn't a real sense of urgency.   Food: Unfortunately, it was just ok. We ordered the tacos and a taco platter. The best was the Carne Asada. Chicken was good, Rockfish was just ok. Rice and beans were ok, a little dry if you ask for my professional opinion. I didn't like that you had to pay for chips and salsa or guacamole. Most Spanish type places put that on the table for you to pick at. Also, it seemed like they charged for everything. Example, if you wanted some sour cream they charge $1 extra for that. Not cool.   Drinks: The drink I had was delicious. I had one of the margaritas and it was very tasty. Lots of ice but tasty. Was it worth $10, no. A little high for me which is why I didn't order another. At $8 per drink they'd sell more.   Restrooms: N/A"}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon, good thing I had it.  Just two of us, two margaritas (good), fried fish tacos dinner, also good, and brisket taco dinner tasty.   Still paid additional $25, plus tip.  Only complaint,  beans had strange seasoning, I personally didn't care for.  Decent chips and salsa.  Wouldn't go back, mostly due to distance from where I live.  Trendy Scottsdale place."}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite go-to for Mexican food! Consistently good! Great Margaritas and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We went out tonight looking for a close, convenient place to eat and we found a winner. The brand new taco & tequila bar, La Sala  in South Chandler is outstanding! The service and food were great and we will definitely be back for a return visit.   We each ordered a 3 taco plate, her's were carnitas while I had Rockfish. Each dish were expertly prepared in the traditional Mexican fashion, but not too spicy! Nice proportions and reasonably priced.   We especially enjoyed the salsa and chips that were served before our entrees.   It was hard to decide which drink was better, the Patron or the La Crema. Both were very good!  Excellent service was provided by our servers, Manlio and Christopher. Both were very attentive."}
{"text":"I thought the management would be embarrassed by their staff's lack of attention to their patrons- but unfortunately I think this is par for the course at this establishment.    Run- far, far away. **Unless you like cold food, missing items (which you're charged for anyway), and being ignored."}
{"text":"Cold, Burnt, Missing Food and Poor Service   Where to begin...  Our dishes were all poor, Tacos were cold, rice undercooked, enchiladas and chimichangas burnt, and worst of all the kids meals were the last things brought to the table after adult meals - instead of the first.  Awful service on a family meal.  Place was only half full on a Saturday night, which makes me think how can a restaurant like this survive - don't waste your time or money here. Plenty of other great restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My bestie and I went here before a show at talking stick resort and were SO EXCITED because the one in Chandler is our place to go for a girls night out. When we learned of this location so close to the venue we got very excited. Sadly, it fails in comparison to it's sister location. We both ordered virgin strawberry margaritas as are both pregnant or breast feeding; the ons we got were so sour they were not drinkable. When we reported this to the waiter the response was \"yea that is the problem with virgin margaritas\" I have never had a sour strawberry margarita, they are usually too sweet. To be told they were not fixable was a shock. We ordered our fave, Queso and the brisket cheese crisp. The queso was good, no issues there.  However, the cheese crisp was floppy with no crisp to it at all and I think there must have been a shortage of brisket because there were pieces of the dish that had no protein on it at all. After the poor drinks and the skimpy portions and the soggy cheese crisp we didn't dare order our churros.. I didn't want them to ruin those for us. Needless to say.. I will stick with the Chandler location."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Was there tonight 6/30 so the guy and girl working-give then a bonus. The food was fair. Except for the guacamole, that was good."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today around 2pm. There appeared to be only the bartender working and there was one patron at the bar. We were welcomed to seat ourselves. We waited quite a while for menus to be brought out and even longer for our food orders to be taken. The street corn appetizer was tastey but the presentation was sloppy. The rest of the food, which also took forever to come out, was disappointing. The bartender was very nice and apologetic for the wait. Unfortunately one nice employee is not enough to ever bring me back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had been out all day and I had a hair appointment that ran way over so it was 830pm on a Monday and we were both starving. I had a craving for fajitas and saw the Groupon for this restaurant so we bought it and went. I did not realize that it was two restaurants in one, and more of a loungie place, so bringing a 4 year old was not ideal. But we were starving and it was late so there was no turning back. The bartender, wish I had gotten her name (blonde hair, tattoos, beautiful) was so gracious with us from the moment we walked in. My daughter was overtired and hungry, so not at her best to say the least. The bartender was super accommodating and kind to us, considering we were using a Groupon and apparently that side of the kitchen had closed, but they prepared our food anyway. Everything was delicious, but the service was what really made our night. My crazy daughter was acting up and running around and nobody made me feel bad for it, even though I of course was stressed to the max. The server, and the manager were also very attentive, kind and went out of their way for us. We just moved to the area so we're not familiar with the restaurants so I was very grateful for the service we received despite it not being a kid kind of restaurant. We were just a starving mom and daughter with a Groupon and we were treated so well! I will definitely be back with my girlfriends or to try their brunch but just wanted to say thank you to the staff that was working last night, from the kitchen staff to the manager and bartender and sever, because you treated us so kindly. And of course the food was great as well!  And their sangrias are only $4 and really good! Being a busy single mom I go out to eat all the time with my daughter, and I don't like to be relegated to the Applebee's and chilis of the world. It was so refreshing to be treated with such great customer service when dining with a 4 year old. This place is doing something right when they go above and beyond for their customers like they did for us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Wine glass was dirty. Water glass had broken chips of glass. A Mexican restaurant- I asked for a veggie taco and they were perplexed. What they came up with was lettuce and cauliflower. Argh. This is a terrible place trying to make up for it with a great location and high prices."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. Queso was very Velveeta-esque...chips were clearly store-bought...chimi was dry...carnitas were pork, but definitely not carnitas...no lime with the tacos...rice and beans from a high school cafeteria...and everything was bland -- not a pepper to be found anywhere. Based on the ratings, this type of chow clearly appeals to some, but hubby and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. I highly recommend trying the old fashioned- it's made with mezcal. Great twist! We started with the Mexican street corn, and chips with guac. I had the chimichanga. Brisket meet inside was tender and flavorful. I did wish my food was a bit hotter, and my husband had to send his back to be heated up. Could be due to Restaurant being new and getting into swing of things. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Groupon has made this place must more affordable. They do not have a lunch menu, so your only chance is to save is to buy the $14 for $25 deal. The place wasn't that crowded on a recent weekday, but it did not affect the food quality, except for the rice. The spanish rice was very undercooked or overcooked - I couldn't tell -but it was left uneaten. The tacos here are kind of served fajita style, which works for the most part until your tortillas gets cold. I ordered the brisket version of the tacos and was nice and fork tender with no fat in sight, although it could have been served hotter. make your own tacos and away you go. We also had that green chile pork in a cute pot which got good reviews as well. Oh and we liked the chips and the chipotle salsa as well."}
{"text":"Friendly service, food came out fast. I enjoyed the chips & salsa and the Farm Salad. Vegan and vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Food wasn't even average for prices and service was non-existent. We had the tacos the chicken ones are your best bet if you give this place a try. Given how empty is was we expected decent service or turn around time for food but I guess that's why it's always empty."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great - kid friendly, date night friendly, girls hh friendly... it's cool! However, once there, the service was terrible and the food was ok. The happy hour prices were nice, but they charged us the regular prices during happy hour. I think it was a mistake and they fixed it after I pointed it out, but there was really no apology and our waitress seemed annoyed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our girls night out evening at the really quaint restaurant. Riley thank you for great service and we loved the food!  Nice date night spot and also if you want to leave work and just go get a nice drink and maybe watch the game or something La Sala is the place for you..."}
{"text":"Food decent but service is incredibly slow.  Went on a Wednesday night. There were three other parties there. One waiter seemed to be handling the bar and the restaurant floor.  It took 50 mins to get our food.  No apologies or offers to get us chips and salsa while we waited. (I guess chips and salsa don't come for free at this Mexican restaurant).  Instead the waiter just wanted us to buy more drinks while we waited.   Sharing a kitchen with the Living Room may not be the best idea if it affects the service here."}
{"text":"1st time here. Great happy hour!  Service was top notch (ask for Ashton) and food was awesome!  Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting friends.  Saw some good reviews so we thought we would give it a shot.  Ordered a round of Margarita's and they were ok... nothing to brag about.  Ordered our food and my friend ordered the chicken burrito and made them aware that she was allergic to onions.  Well, all the burrito had was chicken.  No cheese sauce, nothing!  So he asked for sour cream, which they eventually brought out.  My other friend and I ordered a variety of tacos, shrimp, fish and chicken and they too were just ok.  Had initially ordered them on corn tortillas, but they came out on flour.  No biggie because they eventually brought out a side of the corn, and they were very greasy!"}
{"text":"The ceviche was excellent and actually has olives in it. Something new! Red Sangria was ok, it wasn't my favorite and tasted like something was missing. I ordered a chimichanga and it came with beans and rice. The chimichanga was excellent BUT...didn't come with enough sauce so had to ask for more and even that wasn't enough. I wasn't going to ask for more though. The meat was so good and made to perfection. The only thing I didn't like was the rice! The rice truly was gross. It was white rice stuck in a ball like a big blob of glue with corn bits inside. Skip the rice  Our waiter was very good, Tony."}
{"text":"This is another addition to the Living Room/ Rock Lobster/Chop family in Downtown Ocotillo Plaza. I like the inside of this restaurant. It's got a contemporary Mission Revival style look to it and has a decent amount of space (about 15 tables). Cocktails are a big deal here so they have a large bar area. La Sala (\"living room\" in Spanish) serves a menu featuring a modern take on classic Latin American dishes. The server staff did their job. They took my order and I got my food. I just feel the staff wasn't very welcoming and were more engaged with their daily chores around the restaurant. Once I got my food no one checked on me and I was just handed a bill at the end. The chimichanga I ordered was delicious. It was pretty large and filled with a generous portion of shredded brisket. The meat was very tender and flavorful with a hint of spiciness. I was a little bummed they didn't serve chips and salsa as that is my favorite thing about Mexican restaurants. Overall I had an OK experience and will check them out another time. They offer a limited menu of discounted food and drinks on their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. The prices are a bit high. The frozen margaritas were good ($10 each) though. One person's order was messed up so it was sent back & corrected. Then when my cheese crisp arrived I saw it was burnt all the way around. Well one order had just been sent back & I didn't want to risk spit in my food by sending mine  back. So I ended up eating about a 1/3 of it before i decided it wasn't worth eating.   4 of us had lunch & the bill was $72 (5 alcoholic drinks included in that).   I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon a few weeks ago after wanting to try out this new restaurant close to my office.  We decided to stop in Saturday night for dinner and really enjoyed ourselves.  I started with a white sangria (very tasty) and shared an order of queso with my husband - seriously good stuff with fresh tortillas.  I enjoyed the enchiladas for my entree - perfect size for me, but probably on the small side for others.  Small dining room that is open to the  Living Room next door, friendly servers and good food...definitely a lively atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good food, Seems fresh. Nice Spanish ambiance. I'm giving them four stars instead of five because they seem a little overpriced, although this could be because they are located in Gainey Ranch. I've only gotten to-go from here and service has been great! I had their chicken tortilla soup which is creamy and a little spicy, very good. And their steak cheese crisp and chicken nachos- pretty good. They have happy hour with really good deals!"}
{"text":"We actually ended up walking out since we never got service at the bar. Even people next to us noticed and were trying to be polite to my wife and I. Never again. They should screen their bartenders better, customer service still matters, even at the bar."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service. A group of 3 of us went here for the 1st time on a Wednesday night. There was only one other table of 4 there at the time. The servers were working between the living room and la sala. The wait staff was never around and it took forever for our drinks...and forget about ordering more drinks or refills on water. You couldn't find anyone. Let's move on to the stale chips fried in rancid oil!! We had the waitress try one and she agreed they were awful! I wouldn't waste my time going to this restaurant. There are far better Mexican establishments in Chandler....the margaritas were awful too!"}
{"text":"I will join the others in saying, please return to your original menu and food quality.  We loved our visit when you first opened, but when we visited last week we thought the burrito looked and tasted like the 99 cent frozen grocery store one.  Service was very slow and not friendly.  Not sure if we will go back unless we hear about a change."}
{"text":"Banging guacamole! Great service, good prices especially for their lunch special.  Rice was good too, not dried out like other places.  :) their carne Asada tacos are legit tasty.  New Yorker here in Arizona for the first time and I am impressed."}
{"text":"The only reason this got two stars and not less is the waitress. She was great and very nice and apologetic for all of the mishaps we experienced. Number one: we ordered drinks and the chips and salsa. The chips came out way before the drinks. When she came to take the rest of our order the drinks were still not there. She went to check on them and came back to take our dinner orders. Several minutes later our drinks arrived and it was the incorrect drink from what I ordered. The chips were good--warm crisp and salty. The guac was bland. The waitress recommended the brisket so I did the tacos and my husband the cheese crisp. The brisket was very bland. The tacos were a bing blob of the meat with tortillas on the side. The drinks weren't good either--I finally did get the correct one but it wasn't great. When the bartender brought the correct drink, he managed to spill it all over my husbands meal. I said something under my breath but he didn't seem to realize it. (Yum--a strawberry Serrano cocktail drizzled over a brokers avocado cheese crisp ). The waitress said the manager would be over and he'd comp our round of drinks. There were 4 of us. He took care of 2. And never came over to see us. We were very nice to the waitress and she even appreciated our kindness. For the manager to not even come over?!? Give me a break. This city is filled with SO many other much better restaurants (even Chipotle)."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing service!! I have a corn allergy and they not only made me flower chips so I could eat the salsa, but made my own batch of rice without corn without my asking. So accommodating and friendly!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their food.  It seems very fresh and tasty.  I look forward to coming back again"}
{"text":"This place \"WOWS\", in every possible way from decor, service, drink and  the food!  Can't wait to go back. A little snafu with my drink, but quickly remedied (was there with a group of 12- so all is forgiven with the rowdy bunch). Brisket chimi was cooked to perfection.   Next time, dessert!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed an early dinner here on the weekend.  The weather was in the 80's, the doors were open a nice breeze and fresh air made for a comfortable environment.  The staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas and added a carne asada taco.  The wife ordered fish tacos.  The cheese enchiladas beans and rice were all around good.  It came with 3 enchiladas and a price that matched having the additional enchilada.  The carne asada taco was amazing, from the perfectly seared juicy meat to the smoky salsa and the tangy pickled veggies it all just worked and left me craving more.  My wife enjoyed her fish tacos.  Find her review under Kara Davis for more details."}
{"text":"Saturday night - one hungry hotel guest from across the street (me), two behind the bar (barkeeps), three at the bar (locals), four tables in the dining room (all looking for service), five minutes before I'm even greeted (and then I get a snarky 'Hi - can I get you a drink?\") six-top walks in and the two from behind the bar clamor to them, seven-teen minutes before I get my food.  Unimpressed to say the least. Shrimp taco platter had an ice cream scoop ball of old nasty minute rice, re-hydrated refried beans, and fresh from the freezer shrimp - masked by a spicy mayo and a few shreds of cabbage. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I found this gem on Groupon. Decided to go try it out on a late Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised! We ordered the Brisket Cheese Crisp which was not only cooked to perfection, but it was super delicious (order this as an app for sure)!! Also, being that we were in a Mexican restaurant, we ordered tacos, of course! The tacos (with a side of salsa) were also tasty! We sat at the bar and Aaron (the bartender) took care of us the whole time. Highly recommend this place as we will certainly be back!! We've already visited the Chandler location twice since the initial visit to the Gainey Village location. Love this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this place probably 5 times and love it. Food is delicious, people are friendly and the ambiance is great. Only reason I'm leaving a 3/5 star review is from attention to detail... we had to ask for silverware and dishes to enjoy our appetizer, I asked for double meat on the cheese crisp (which I was charged for) but didn't get it, the water we were served was warm tap water and I had to ask for extra salsa twice because she forgot. I do love this place and enjoy the tacos as well as the cheese crisp, so hopefully next time it's a wee bit better of an experience. We'll probably head back to the Scottsdale location in lieu."}
{"text":"Cute place. Needs a patio tho. We got food on hh and everything was pretty tasty. Have been here three times now and sat at the bar. Service was good and food came out fast. You can get a beer and taco combo on hh. Great prices. Def a good spot to check out."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately the reviews proved to be true. We recently moved to the area and were excited to try this really cool looking restaurant. The food was actually pretty good despite the beans being cold but the service was terrible and extremely slow. The staff was not friendly at all. I didn't see a single smile on any of their faces the entire time we were there. They seemed extremely busy despite there only being four tables seated. Our chips and salsa came 30 minutes after being seated and literally 2 minutes before our dinner. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"BEST. TACOS. EVER. that's all.  I've been here three times in three weeks and I'll I can think about is their shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"The food was good; however,  we watched customers send back cold food and we personally had to send back food as it was not what we had ordered.  Our first concern was the glassware was spotty and did not seem appealing when ordering beverages.  As we continued to observed, we found the staff washing glassware with new water in the sink but the rinse water was cloudy and unchanged and that was followed by a coffee like color in the sanitation sink.  No wonder glassware looked as it did.   We will give this one more try before crossing it off our list...hopefully things improve with cleanliness and quality."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch one Friday afternoon recently since we drive by every day. We both had a margarita as they were on happy hour and we really enjoyed it. We had the guacamole and chips and they were good. I noticed that every taco had pretty much the same toppings which I thought was very, very bland. I was hoping that each taco had a topping that would complement the protein inside but it seems there was not thought behind anything beside the protein.  I asked our server what were the best selling tacos and he said the crispy shrimp and the brisket. I said to him to surprise me and give me two tacos. He ordered me the brisket on a flour tortilla and the grilled fish on corn. The brisket was flavored nicely but the toppings were so flavorless. I would have thought he would have ordered me the crispy shrimp since he mentioned it was a best seller and one of his favorites but no he ordered me the grilled fish. I literally had one bite as it was not good at all. The fish inside was so tiny, the corn tortilla was cold and the toppings inside were tasteless again. I literally could not eat one more bite of it. The server was nice and friendly but didn't even notice I didn't eat my taco (there was only 6 people in the entire restaurant at the time so it wasn't like he was overly busy waiting on other tables). I was disappointed in our lunch as I think they still need to work on the menu and tweak some of the recipes."}
{"text":"Yummm!! What a cute place and right next door to The Living Room! Great happy hour menu! Nachos were the best ever!!! And be sure to ask for their hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Great Beverages! Freat Food! Great Sports! Football And NASCAR! Did I mention the people are very cool!  Ben is very creative and puts together great specialty drinks!  Personally I love the grilled fish tacos!  Don't forget the many specials... NFL nights! Sunday, Monday AND Thursday!"}
{"text":"The place was great when they first opened. We came here at least 3 times and the 4th time it was a disaster. They used to make a great old fashion with a huge round block of ice; this time it was crushed ice. My wife ordered a drink and it was half filled. The rest of the order was bland and mediocre. It seems like they skimped on whatever they could. The street corn had a drizzle of topping. We ordered chips and guacamole and received enough chips for one and when asked for a refill they charged us for it! Also I swear our server was high; he forgot our order, he asked us if we needed to order after we had just placed an order with him, etc. It is sad when a place that was once one of our favorites decided money is more important than the passion of having great food and service. On the bright side one of the servers remembered us too bad we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Enchiladas and tacos are some of the best we've had. Recommend trying. Nice friendly staff. Infused seasonal tequilas made on site are great!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch after reviewing the \"Where\" magazine in our hotel room. We were so excited to try it. The restaurant has a lovely patio with full length windows that open into the bar & restaurant. In fact, the restaurant is so open it goes into the neighboring restaurant. The waitress was very pleasant when she came out to service on the patio. I am not sure but she may have been a co-owner she was so excited to hear where we found out about the restaurant.   First, We had a bowl of chips and salsa. Apparently, the chips were a mix of old stale chips along with some new fresh ones. The salsa was fresh and delicious. My partner and I both noticed about half were stale. Our meal consisted of a lunch special of a taco platter. My partner had brisket tacos and I ordered one fish and one shrimp taco. Yet, Both tacos were extremely small like a street taco. The plate was loaded with rice and beans as most places tend to do. My shrimp tacos only came with three little shrimps.   Then, when the meal was over and I got the bill, The charge for both the plates was two dollars more than what was advertised - - or so I thought. I brought it up to the waitress' attention, and she informed me that brisket and shrimp was a dollar more per taco as stated in the fine print below on the menu. What is surprising to me is, it was lunchtime and there really weren't that many people there, AND on the bottom of the receipt was a coupon for $5.00 dollars off your meal on the next visit And a 20% off coupon inside the billfold. So my surprise is: why couldn't we have a discount because I didn't notice the fine print. It just doesn't make sense in my book. For the small tacos and lack of understanding, I think I'll head down the road next time."}
{"text":"Not a kid friendly spot. Service was meh. Our waiter forgot our app, gave it to us after entrees and still charged us full price. Waiter also got the wrong tacos I ordered. Originally ordered tap beer, the tap went out. Food was very average, nothing to go back to."}
{"text":"First off this place is just a extra little room in The Living Room restaurant that looks like it shares the same kitchen. We started with some chips and salsa that tasted like they were cooked in dirty engine oil. Next I had some carnitas tacos that had no seasoning at all, they just tasted like plain shredded pork. I also tasted part of the chimichanga that also had the same dirty burnt oil flavor of the chips. They had a cool little bar though, however I didn't see any bartender working at it."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas for $10. Brisket and Carne asada tacos bomb! Delicious mesquite flavor. House made hot sauce so so so so so so good. Bartender gave us great table service. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and good margaritas. If this is what you are looking for I highly recommend. Only negative is the price point is a bit inflated but not unreasonable"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times before, with various friends that run the gambit. The service is amazing, the food is great, the tequila is beyond, wow what a selection of GOOD tequila! Great light to full dinner/ pre funk place. The atmosphere will help your mood, the service and their helpful knowledge about tequila will take your mood even higher.  But for the sake of your well being order the Latin Caesar salad with carne asada, simple made perfect! Salute!"}
{"text":"So our server explains the keg pump isn't working well so the beer just foams and is a little warm. This is as he serves it! After tasting it, I elect to try ice and ask for some. When the ice doesn't arrive, I walk to the bar and ask. The young lady there drops everything and delivers a full glass of ice. Next time our server comes by I surrender the beer and order a glass of wine. He comps the beer and delivers the wine...as we are finishing our meal!? My shrimp quesadilla had very few shrimp and not enough cheese. The contents were so skimpy the tortilla wouldn't stay together. Amateurs who may or may not provide what you ordered."}
{"text":"I loved their ambience and service and great food. They are generous with chips and salsa and sauces. EXCELLENT SERVICE. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos are amazing. Tender and flavorful!  Two tacos and the guac and chips was more than enough to satisfy my craving for Mexican food.   The staff was friendly and efficient!  I will return!"}
{"text":"My wife is Hispanic and she says these tacos are the best. I agree though, I am just a gringo."}
{"text":"Went here during the first week that they were open so I wasn't expecting perfection. Let me start off with the fact that the food was pretty good. Not the best but definitely better than most. Also, the service was surprisingly good given that they had just opened. However, now lets talk about the value. The prices were pretty high even by Scottsdale standards and the serving sizes bordered on insultingly small. We ordered some green chili pork stew, which is one of our favorite dishes, and we were pretty surprised to see the price and then we were dumbfounded by the portion size. Seriously, it was a ramekin of stew. Not a bowl. Not a cup. And the cost was more than we have ever paid for this dish anywhere (and more than double what a portion that size should have been). Our other food was also relatively tasty but tiny. The place is nice. The service and food were good. However, we are not likely to return, even though we are at that strip center all of the time, because we just don't like to leave a restaurant feeling seriously ripped off. Without major changes this place will not last through the summer."}
{"text":"Sunday, May 7 at approximately 12:00.; takeout order placed at the establishment. The manager on duty took the order. It was very simple, two taco platters, one with grilled shrimp, one with grilled fish, both with corn tortillas. And, one order of  Shrimp Ceviche. He left with a very large bag but when he arrived home, there were only two individual tacos and both were with flour tortillas. The cold slaw filling was made from nothing but cabbage and mayonnaise. The tortilla chips with the Shrimp Ceviche tasted like they were fried in rancid oil.  The manager was obviously an idiot and the food was really awful!  But I do have one good thing to say about the establishment (and the others in the same strip mall). If your married and looking to hookup with someone other than your spouse, this is a great place for it!    Guaranteed home run every time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time not too long ago.  I'm a big fan of the area, as I go to neighboring restaurants all the time. I was craving Tacos, and we said screw it...let's try this place.  Their menu wasn't bad...but it wasn't all that big. You just can't be picky. my friend got the Green Chile Burger (I think thats what its called). She really liked it alot, and it looked good.  I got 3 tacos (1 fish, 2 carne asada). Not gonna like, I wasn't a huge fan of the fish taco. The carne asada was actually really good. It tastes fresh and authentic as if it had just been grilled in the back and didn't taste preserved etc. Thats what sold me.  Customer service was fantastic. She was very helpful, and she dealt with a really annoying customer nearby really professionally. Props to her and the people that she has to put up with sometimes!   Customer service 5/5 Restaurant cleanliness 5/5 Food 4/5 (5/5 for the tacos) Price (3/5)  I'll be back to try and get this review to 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"There are some things to love about this place, but some meh mixed in as well.  Loved - Margarita selection is great. Loved the spicy pomegranate.  - Love the tequila selection - Fried ice cream was great - Carne asada tacos were really good - Love the modern look of the restaurant - Love the bar section. Large screen TVs to watch while sitting at the bar. - Food presentation is really nice - Service was great.  Very friendly staff.  The Meh - Queso dip. It was a real thick Velveeta cheese like dip.  If I have the opportunity to go back then I will probably try the guacamole dip instead - Chips come from a bag. Note, I don't know this for a 100% fact but they look and taste that way.   - Salsa.  It tasted fresh but had no heat to it at all. - Rice and beans (side dishes on my taco platter entree)  Summary This place overall is between 3 and 4 stars, probably depending on what you order.  If 1/2 stars were available then I would give it a 3 1/2.  Since they are not I rounded to 4 based on the awesome service."}
{"text":"Tried this pretty little Cantina for happy hour.. great skinny and spicy margaritas!! The appetizers were satisfying and the chips are so good! Crunchy and not to thick or thin. Nice ambience and love the little touches like the ornate Mexican glass water bottle at table, Spanish decor and the bar is aesthetically pleasing. Will be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Cute spot, nice and attentive staff and great food. I recommend taco Tuesday, 2 dollar tacos!"}
{"text":"Definitely not up to my Mexican food standard. The meat was okay but their fry oil is terrible making the chips, tacos, and anything else you deep fry taste old. I am amazed of all the great reviews since it wasn't great. for it being dinner time there is only us and one other table. Other than the food, the service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"First time at La Sala I found the service to be way above average and the food was fantastic.  Happy Hour prices were good.  I had the Cheese crisp, Street Corn, and Shrimp Tacos.  All were amazing.  I will be back and I will be telling friends about this place."}
{"text":"When I eat Mexican food, I want to fill up on chips and salsa. I could generally care less about the actual meal. Driving home one day I decided to stop in with the hubby for a quick late lunch. Service was great. The waiter was friendly and food came out fast. Cheese enchiladas were good and not covered in mounds of cheese. Rice was undercooked but that's ok. I don't really like rice. Margaritas were good and strong. My only complaint is that the chips tasted like fish. Literally. It kinda grossed my out to think the homemade chips were fried in the same grease as a piece of fish. Probably wouldn't come back for that reason."}
{"text":"The ambience is cool but if you are hoping to drink or hear Latin music, forget it! Latin is just a written phrase under their name. The waitress never heard about caipirinha, most famous drink I. brazil and the DJ only had Only one Brazilian song to offer!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with coworkers this past Friday. Not at all impressed with the service. Bartender was training new waitstaff who was overwhelmed by a table of 7. Most of us had ordered ala-cart tacos which should have been a simple order. 2 of us had ordered a burrito plate. No alcohol just waters, teas and soda. 3 orders were screwup & one of those didn't come out until the rest of us were all done eating. All of this went on as the bartender became busy with customers at the bar and what I assume was the manager who was pacing at the door absolutely doing nothing to fix the problem. The tacos were tasty but $4 per taco for lunch seems too high. I work in the complex and would put this last on list for lunch."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour, $5 draft beers and a taco! Food and appetizers came out very quick and were delicious!"}
{"text":"This new Mexican Fusion Restaurant can be a small plate experience or full meal with several entree size meals.  A good wine selection, beers and , of course, a selection of Tequilas."}
{"text":"New places are always fun to try. My husband and I went out on s double date. Uber was our plan because we knew some tequila tasting was in the future. Food was excellent- carne asada and shrimp tacos, chicken quesadillas and guacamole. I enjoyed sipping on the spicy pomegranate margarita (NEW to the menu). Nice place!"}
{"text":"Went their Saturday and the food was very good. The restaurant had an ambient of lights that make the atmosphere very nice. If you don't believe me go yourself."}
{"text":"Shrimp Tacos - Bay shrimp with cabbage mayo Fish Tacos - Tilapia cabbage mayo Rice - With canned corn mixed in Beans black from a can with cotija cheese Salsa - Stewed/canned tomatoes not fresh Guacamole - Old tasting avocados Service - Served wrong dinner - not very alert  They don't serve fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"We thought this was our favorite taco booth at the taco festival so when I saw a Groupon we had to go in and try them again. Winner winner chicken dinner!  The family was very excited when we arrived. We had just the parking spot waiting for us. They have a great little patio but we opted for a booty inside. We got sat quickly and water and chips and salsa came out quick. We were here for tacos so we went straight for the tacos a la carte: four chicken, three pork carnitas and a carne asada.  Yummo! They were all great but I would say the pork carnitas was the winner, my husband said the chicken.  My frozen margarita was probably at least a 12oz drink. Delicious! Super frozen so melted at the perfect rate. Got the fried ice cream to share. It was heavenly. The restaurant has a beautiful tile bar and they played a great Spanish station. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with my experience tonight. I decided to not give one star because  I did love coming here before. I had people tell me the food and service wasn't good but I couldn't believe it. They've made some changes to the menu and skimped on a lot. They no longer serve empanadas. The street corn was very basic. There was only a little mayo tajin stuff and most of it was just corn. This use to be my husband and my favorite place for street corn. We tried the enchiladas they added to the menu and the chicken taco platter. The dishes didn't look appetizing when they brought it out. There wasn't much food on the plate (which was fine in the end because I didn't eat all my food). The enchiladas tasted like a microwave oven dish. Good enough to eat just because you are hungry. Not worth $13. The taco platter was a make your own style and also tasted meh. My drink wasn't filled to the top like it usually has been. My husband ordered a oaxan old fashion that was watered down and asked for the watermelon serrano instead which was better.  I'm not try to be mean but we thought our waiter was high. He was the only server happy and smiling which we liked but he kept forgetting what we ordered or even if we ordered anything.  It seemed as if they were skimping to make their budget. I'll say that atmosphere is still nice and drinks were still good. I wouldn't come here for food anymore, if at all. I am really sad and hope some changes for the good are made soon. I use to recommend this restaurant a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to Living Room, so you can order off their menu as well.  I really like the chips and salsa here.  Nachos with chicken are good too.  But the green chile stew is spicy and deelish!  Homemade flour tortillas.  Good happy hour prices with a nice wine selection.  Service is always great and attentive!"}
{"text":"We went to la Sala about a month after it opened and had fantastic food. I ordered a taco platter, it was a small portion for a restaurant, but more than enough for me. The presentation was beautiful a d the flavors were ahmazing! Our daughter ordered ribs of the appetizer menu because they didn't have a kids menu and she has been bugging me to go back ever since. There were 8 of us and I don't remember all the orders, but we all said we'd be back. I had a Paloma and it was excellent. Everyone else had margaritas and the said they were great!  Fast forward to last week. The menu had the same basic items as before, but they added a kids menu. For appetizers we ordered nachos, green chili stew, and a couple of orders of ribs. Those were all great. I ordered the shrimp tacos that I loved so much lady time, but what I got didn't ever resemble last time. I wish I would've taken a pictures I got a blob of beans, a scoop of rice, 3 tortillas rolled in wax paper, and a blog of under cooked, salty shrimp under a creamy coleslaw. When the server placed it in front of me I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she said it was. Who completely changes a meal at a restaurant and doesn't change the name or something to alert customers? One of the men in our group ordered his food with a side of beans and the beans were cold. The margaritas were more ice than anything and the Paloma was now made with pink grapefruit juice (another change not mentioned) and it was just ok.   I just don't understand why the changed sooo much within months of opening! Unfortunately, the changes were not for the better. I hope they will go back to our original experience. I don't know how I would know though. After our last experience I have no reason to return/"}
{"text":"this place is truly amazing!!! wow where do i start??? the service is great the waitress that was taking care of me her name was taylor was real professional, she would just keep bringing me drinks without asking and she even brought me one to go when i was done eating so props to taylor for a job well done. then next came the food which was excellent not to pricey and you get a lot for what you pay for which fills you up. i was very happy with my experience here and will difitnley be back again."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food in a very clean and modern environment.  I would recommend this place to friends and will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit. We had the chimi, green chili pork and a brisket taco split between the two of us. Their fresh made salsa is amazing and bartender was top notch. Only thing preventing five stars is that the rice was undercooked and not tender. Had to put a lot of salsa on top to compensate."}
{"text":"Once again, really wanted to love this place! What a great location, atmosphere, and the food is fantastic, if you ever get it. The service here is, bar none, the worst service we've had anywhere in Scottsdale. We went on a Sunday night, and the service was horrible. The entire bar was covered with dirty dishes and glassware. It took forever to get waited on. The servers were distracted and rude. We figured maybe they were short staffed, so we decided to give it another try. We went on a recent Friday night, and were told to sit anywhere. We sat at a table that had been recently occupied. The waitress cleared the table, but didn't wipe it down. We ordered drinks, which never came. Twenty minutes later, she reappeared and asked if we'd like to order a drink. She didn't remember she had already waited on us! There were only six occupied tables in the place, and we're not usually that forgettable! All the tables in the restaurant were talking about how horrible the service was. One lady asked three times for a refill on her water, and finally got up and got herself a glass of water! We finally got drinks, and after almost an hour, our hors d oeuvres. Our food came right away after the appetizer. My husband had ordered a chicken dish, but received a beef dish. We were over the whole thing by then, so we just left without saying anything. They didn't seem to be very interested in customer service or feedback anyway."}
{"text":"The service is crazy slow, the tall guy behind the bar is awesome but he can't run the entire joint. Our bartender was sweet but she had no idea what she was doing. We sat at the bar because the restaurant was empty for the most part but our sweet bartender still couldn't offer mediocre service. We ordered fresh warm chips and guacamole to start, I asked for a cup of soup and a taco. We were on our 2nd round of drinks before everything we ordered was placed in front of us at the same time. Soup-Chilled  Taco-Warm  Chips-YUCK!!! The worst after taste ever...do NOT order the chips! I think the food has a lot of potential but temperature is everything. Not sure if I will go back...."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable spot...Josh the Bartender was very attentive even on a busy Friday Night. Tasty Nachos and excellent Margaritas!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the mediocre reviews..what I ordered was great!  The chips are light and crunchy, the salsa is flavorful without being too spicy"}
{"text":"Had good at the bar.  They could take in the cash if they were more attentive at the bar.  I'll stick with bartenders I know who are on the ball .  Only 7 people at the bar.   Food good."}
{"text":"We were so so excited to try this place as we're huge advocates of not going to chain restaurants and supporting the community.  Also we're huge fans of the Living room and Chop and absolutely love them! La Sala was a disappointment tonight, we went to order drinks and even though they call themselves a tequila bar there's no speciality margaritas or even a tequila list. We ended up ordering (vodka) drinks and one person was passed over to not order, and two of 5 drinks came out wrong. We were going to order dinner but thinking it was a Mexican food restaurant some were hoping for burritos or even a simple enchilada. The menu was pretty small and the tacos looked amazing but sadly we ended up next door at the living room since most people in our party wanted more options than just a taco platter. We hope to try them again soon!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. I expected it to be \"chain-ee\" but it was pretty authentic. Chips N Salsa were top notch and tacos were tasty! I can't wait to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love the place but it started off rough due to the bartender (Dillion). Instead of being welcoming, we felt awkward walking in there and someone telling us where not to sit vs where to sit. How about a smile Dillion? If you don't want us to fend for ourselves then maybe hire a hostess? The place was not that busy for a Saturday night and that should tell you something. Hats off to the cooks and our waitress (Cameron). They both knew what they were doing, but Dillion should work in the back where he doesn't have to deal with customers."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks. Food was good. Service was excellent and the margarita was better than most. Will return again for sure."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:46. Stood at the hostess stand for another 3 minutes then was told the kitchen was closed. I asked what time it closed and was told at 9:00. After showing her it was 8:50 the server shrugged her shoulders and said, 'closed but you can try next door'. We were really looking forward to this new restaurant, too."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try a new Mexican restaurant and have been seeing this one advertised on Groupon for a while so thought I would give it a try.  Based on the reviews I was a little nervous about the chips because someone commented they thought they were from a bag.  There is NO WAY they were from a bag!  They were delicious along with the salsa.  I had a regular margarita and my son had the spicy pomegranate.  They were so good we actually had two.  My son doesn't like guacamole so I just got a side and it was good.  I had a grilled shrimp taco and fried fish (recommended by server) and they were very good, liked shrimp the best.  My son got the brisket taco dinner and loved it!  We definitely will be back!  Good find for a new (to us) Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My son took us to La Sala because he had a Groupon. I had never been there and won't be going back. Let's start with the server. In the bottom 5% of any server I've ever had the pleasure--or in this case, displeasure--of ever dealing with. Never smiled, impolite. Either she was leaving the job for one with the DMV, had broken up with her boyfriend or her dog died that morning--or all three. The chips and guacamole were above average. I had the chicken tacos, beans and rice. The tacos were tiny; they looked like an appetizer. Rice and beans unmemorable. One good thing: The enthusiastic manager came over a few time to ask how we were doing and replenish our corn chips.  I question whether La Sala can stay in business. A chain like Manuel's if far superior"}
{"text":"Beautiful layout! We loved the leather booths too. Manlio was our server and was attentive, friendly, and took great care of us. We ordered the nachos with tomatillo chicken, they were probably the BEST nachos we've ever had! Next we had tacos: Fried/grilled shrimp? Go with FRIED! they were lightly battered, crispy and delicious. Also ordered carnitas and carne Asada. Look my pics, lots of meat, wonderful grilled flavor too. And alas, it's dessert time so we got the fried ice cream! It came on a crispy cinnamon churro-like bowl!!! Overall we had a wonderful dinner with great service too. Everyone walks by and smiles, grabs empty plates, fills water, asks if you need anything...It's a MUST TRY restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Tacos were excellent.  Had the carne asada and the chicken tacos.  They were fast, delicious, and fairly priced... about $4.00 per taco.  I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Straight up, this place is outstanding for what it is. No need to dress up, yet it is still classy. Food is fantastic, fresh, tasty and served relatively quickly. The reason I gave this place 5 starts is because of the premium tequila menu. The bar tender Brandon, makes a phenomenal Margarita and the service was friendly and accommodating.  I laugh at the stupid snowflake who have this place a bad review. Happy it didn't detour me from coming to check this place out."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and we're pleasantly surprised!  Quest is really good. Great margaritas and the food is amazing. Service is good too. Lots of parking. We will be back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Really good service but that's about it here.  Everything was super average. We were hoping this was gonna be a finer dining experience. It left us a bit flat.  The ribs were super dry and the Mexican corn tasted boiled and like they just sprinkled some cheese on it. Not much to write home about. It's s very casual place. I believe it's owned by the same people who own the Living Room next door. Which has  much cooler vibe an decent food at best as well.  Probably won't be back and I doubt this place lasts very long. People were super friendly though!"}
{"text":"La Sala opened recently next to one of my favorite restaurant, Living Room. Since both restaurants share a kitchen, I had pretty high expectations for this place. Restaurant size is smaller than the Living Room but the atmosphere was pretty cosy and intimate. If you have a party of four (or less), I don't think you will have an issue getting a table as they have a lot of booths that accommodate that party size. If you have bigger parties, call in advance to make a reservation. My party of 6 walked in without a reservation and thankfully, the community table at the back of the restaurant was available. Food - everything was ok, nothing too special. I ordered the shrimp ceviche and chicken enchiladas. Would probably not order the ceviche here again. Not worth the money. Otherwise, the one great thing about this place was that the servers were great - very funny and social.   Note: No patio. No dogs allowed."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is great deal with the $2 Beef or Chicken deep fried tacos. The salsa and guacamole are always delicious. The best taco selection off the regular menu is the brisket, the flavor is amazing! Taylor has been our server several times and is always super friendly. Stephanie is always so nice as well!!!"}
{"text":"This is not the place for Mexican food.  Although the place was quite nice inside, the food was boring and bland."}
{"text":"Calm down with those prices. If the food is good, I'll pay. If it's not, I won't be back. The food was already prepared before we walked in and kept warm until it was ordered. Pickled garnish on tacos is not fresh.  The additional star is for the refried beans...spicy and good.If I could give it another star for the $12 margarita, I would, but I can't.  Since it is fast food, it needs fast food prices. There is nothing special going on here."}
{"text":"First time here and I had the pork carnitas tacos while my husband had the burrito. The food was good, service was good. I recommend it and we will be back. I hope business picks up because it was not full on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the best margaritas in Chandler by FAR, and delicious tacos. We love coming here for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a quick bite to eat before heading to the movies.   We ordered some appetizers to share. I got the street corn and the carne  asada taco. The street corn did NOT have enough cheese and mayo on it at all!! It's like they only put it on one side of the corn! What about the other side!? Lol. I like my street corn smothered in cheese and mayo. The taco was basic. Nothing special. However the drinks are delicious! I'm not sure if they have a rotating menu but the drinks that I ordered are not currently on their website. I saw someone post a picture of a tiramisu martini and I just had to try it. It wasn't on their menu so you'll have to ask for it. It was strong but delicious! They had a cocktail called warermelon Serrano which was also delicious. I also don't see that on their website either.   I honestly think their drinks are better than their food. I'd come back for happy hour. Which is Monday to Friday."}
{"text":"$13.95 for 3 tiny things cheese enchiladas, $3.50 for a Diet Coke . The enchiladas weren't even good, way to salty. Served with rice and beans and the rice was ok, but the beans were not good. Carne asada  tacos $13.95 small portion and not that good. We will never go back."}
