{"text":"845 and the posted hrs say 9pm. Just told me it's closed. Really?  Good riddance! How are you still open?"}
{"text":"Finally a hotdog place that rocks!  Grilled dogs, crinkle fries and onion rings. Get a signature hotdog or build your own. Causal atmosphere offering a bar but no TVs which my wife said is a good thing. If your looking for a hotdog spot, you found it. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"the cashier forgot or never learned manners which was a bad takeaway from the experience.  be prepared to pay for the food here; a bit on the high side for hot dog joints.   the hot dogs we ordered were both good which left two smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"I got two kinds of chili dogs, can't remember the names, but one had cole slaw, the other one didn't. They were good. They had a nice bite to them and the buns were nice and soft. I got the fries, but I was not impressed with them. The onion rings were pretty good though.   Seating seemed tight, but the place was decently clean. The drink station seems lackluster, maybe I've just been spoiled by the touch screen dispensers with infinity+ options.   Overall, it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I asked for a signature dog without onions, it arrived with onions. Bacon was a little too crispy and burnt tasting for my liking.  The dog itself was decent. Nothing worth going home and smacking my mama over, but adequate.  I hope to give this place another chance in the future and hope for a better result."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and a fun atmosphere. The kids love coming here.  All the dogs I've tried are great, with my fav being the Whistle Pig. The onion rings are great too...well seasoned, thinly slices, and crispy."}
{"text":"Let me just state that coming from Chicago we had high expectations.  We also were very disappointed.  Now I can understand that not every hot dog that claims to be a Chicago Dog comes with the neon green relish.  But that is no excuse to serve badly burned food with rotten tomatoes. The french fries were barely thawed and the unseasoned, burned onion rings smelled like they were cooked in rancid grease.   The staff paid very little attention to customers and were more interested in watching the tv over the bar and horsing around. The 2 gentlemen that worked there were flat out rude to people. They actually seemed inconvenienced by having to bring food to tables and there were only 2 other tables in the whole place at 6:00pm on a Friday night.  On the up side that restaurant is very clean.  I really wished they took as much care and pride in their food as they do in the way their restaurant looks."}
{"text":"This will be a short and sweet review.  (OK Not so much--Yelp kept pestering me to add more).    The dogs are outstanding.  So are the rings.  Service is consistent.  It's not super fast because the dogs are grilled and then made to order.  But it is consistent and good.  Staff is casual/friendly (the ladies a bit more so then the gentlemen who can be kind of quiet).  Value is good.  Location is good but it IS a little hidden.  You kinda have to park and then look for it.  It's worth taking a few minutes to find it.    I recommend the Coney Island Dog. That's my go-to.  But pretty much everything there is great.  They also do \"specials\" which can be pretty creative.  Check the signboard when you go in.    The best deal is the double dog combo.  Basically you get 2 of their dogs (any kind you like) a side and a drink for $10.  That's a LOT of food.  Let me tell you, their dogs are decently sized but they are all meat.  There's not a bunch of junk or fillers or whatever manufacturers put into cheap hotdogs.  I'm a guy and I gotta say it'd be very hard for me to eat ALL of that in one sitting and if I did, I'd need a little time to recover.  :)  Lighter appetites?  If you get this, just plan on taking some home.    This place is never super busy.  Sometimes there's a short line to order but it moves quickly.  Then you're getting your drink and sitting down.  It takes a few minutes to get your food.  The grill is in the back and it's constantly going.  Counter staff get the plain dogs from the grill and put on all the fixings so you can actually watch that if you want.      There is a bar for seating, dining and drinking (looks like a full bar--never sat there).  There are large screen TVs around, usually with a game on.  There is outdoor, covered seating.  Occasionally you will see families with their dogs dining out there.    I don't know why more people don't go there.  It's a great hot dog joint!"}
{"text":"Finally got to JJ's the other day and was happy I did (just sorry it took so long). The hot dogs were awesome!  I had the Whistle Pig -  it was incredible - and the Joliet Jake. I'm not a big fan of relish but wanted to see how it compared to the ones I've had in Chicago.  JJ's wins! My son was pleased and full from his Quarter Hounder.  Love the fact that they have a bar with great beer choices.  You can come have a dog, beer, and catch a game.  Haven't tried anything else on the menu but they have lots of choices beyond hot dogs.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was heading home from Raleigh and while I was hungry, I didn't want to spend a lot or have a long drawn out dinner.  JJ's fits the bill.  On the positive side, their dogs are grilled and not boiled.  Their menu covers the gamut of hot dogs from around the country.  Growing up in Jersey, we ate all beef dogs, Nathans, Hebrew Natl, Sabrett so eating the Sahlen's hot dogs was definitely different. For my money there is nothing better than a good beef hot dog.  JJ's does offer a beef dog as well as a veggie dog so next time I'll try the beef.  All the hot dogs are served on a Martin's potato roll.  I am not a big fan of the Martins rolls.  I found them a little on the gummy side. I had the Chicago dog.  Their version was good but was missing the poppy seed bun.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to make one just as easily and good at home but when your in the mood  for one and don't want to cook it the JJ's is a good alternative."}
{"text":"Well.....to start, they wouldn't accept the Check-in offer of a free basket of hand-cut fries because they \"don't have hand cut fries anymore.\" The cashier actually told me that their \"marketing manager doesn't update things as much as they should.\"  We waited a good 15 minutes for our food to come out. There were only 2 other tables in the whole place. It was also uncomfortably warm in there for some reason.       The cashier recommended the cole slaw to me. I'm not a food snob by any means, but the slaw was horrible. I think maybe they make it with sour cream instead of mayo. I'm really not sure what was wrong with it, but I very much disliked it.  The tea was not to my liking either- I tried sweet and I sweet mixed, and I just wasn't crazy about the taste.     I don't know- this place was just not what I expected. I don't think a hot dog dinner ( 2 double baskets, 1 single, and 2 kids meals) should cost $40. They're just hot dogs, and they weren't awesome. They were ok."}
{"text":"Sooo glad to see these fine dogs land in my Ballantyne neighborhood.  JJ's just opened in Ballantyne Commons and since I received a coupon for a free dog from their facebook page, I stopped in for the first time after work last week.  Of course I was not disappointed. Chose my favorite, the Char Heel combo.  The server taking my order suggested the homemade lemonade and boy was he spot on!  It was delicious without being overly sweet or too tart.  I decided to eat at the small bar area since it was early in the dinner hour.  Friendly service at the bar as well and my ticket was immediately transferred there from the front.  Washed the dog down with a Natty Greene's IPA.  Lots of local brews on tap and a great selection of bottled beers too.  Sit at the bar and watch some TV, or bring the fam for a quick meal.  Can't wait to try the Chicago dog for the next hole punch in my JJ's card.  Pickle and sauce bar too for those needing extra flavor for their meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time this weekend after getting a coupon in the mail. We had a great experience, and look forward to coming back sometime in the future, especially for the $2 Tuesday specials.  My wife and I each got two different types of hot dogs. All 4 were a delicious treat.  My only criticism of one hotdog was the Chicago Dog. It was very yummy overall, but  being from Chicago, its a little bit of a let down to see a Chicago Dog not served on a poppyseed bun.  Heck, even Sonic manages to do that. Such seems to be a reoccurring criticism of this place, and something I would think management would fix by now.  It's a minor detail at the end of the day, but it's a detail those of us from Chicago care about.  Thankfully, the taste of the dog was still spot on, so it's not worth getting bent out of shape over as some on Yelp have done.  Overall, a great experience. I really appreciate the  char the hot dogs get when they cook them.  It really adds an extra dimension of flavor to each bite of your hot dog.  I would also like to suggest with onion rings, that JJ's serve it with a side of some type of spicy mayo sauce of some sort.  The onion rings were very good, but a spicy mayo  sauce would give them that little extra zing.  I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place for hotdogs to bring the kids out and a good family atmosphere I recommend this place highly.  I had a awesome time in there with my father and I made a great night very low-key place with A nice staff staff parking is okay."}
{"text":"This spot gives you a feeling of being in a real hot dog joint. This is a no frills place. But the food is good the atmosphere is better."}
{"text":"I've given it another try. I see improvement in all directions. Staff is more friendly. They don't have the \"deer in the headlights\" look anymore.. I thought their signature dogs were very good. Great location and atmosphere. I think once this place is really fine-tuned it will be a great addition to dining options in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"This is the best place on Earth. I know I gave 5 stars but if I could give 6 stars, I 100% would. The hot dogs are AMAZING and you can get great deals on Tuesday. I love the hot dogs and they side are just as awesome. They have a great, really nice manager and the place is well run. 3 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"For the best dogs in Charlotte they tasted fair...I've had much worse but also much better...we've had better hotdogs at home.  Fries and chips were OK.  Milkshakes were not great.  Service was good.  Overall it was just OK."}
{"text":"Quality of the hot dogs is a lot better than you typically see.  Certainly now our goto place for a dog!  Onion rings were great too.  The orange-aid made with fresh squeezed oranges was light and great!"}
{"text":"Creative menu, stellar execution.  What a fun place!    They did well to round out all their food options with a strong bar showing.  You can bring the kids, but you can just as well have a casual hang out here with your friends.  You get the sense that this place is run by good people.  Who also care a lot about their customers."}
{"text":"what can you say...hands down best dogs in charlotte..dirty jerse and coney today...favs got to be whistle pig...bacon on a dog...how could that not be great"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I posted a \"1 star\" review noting that my children, ages 10 and 11, were not fond of JJ's Red Hot dogs.  Mentioned that I question a place where children would turn up their nose to a hotdog! Apparently, the folks at JJ's didn't like my honest yet negative review; had Yelp corporate remove that review. It was removed based on a technicality, that a review cannot be based on another person's thoughts...   To comply 100% to the rules and highlight the fact that JJ actively attempted to remove a negative review...  He is mine from my POV!!!  JJ's hotdogs are marginally above those hotdogs at the local gas station that spin and turn 24hrs a day. The attempt to \"fancy\" up the fare with toppings which are not fresh or tasty.  Really a \"lipstick on a pig\" attempt of a gourmet hotdog. The flavor does not match the prices, again not too much better than dogs at the gas station.    As for the kids hotdogs, they have a think skin on them which my kids did not like.  Had to return to the counter and order a regular \"adult\" menu dog for them to even bite into them.   If you are still reading this... it's just a hotdog right!?!?  Yes, just a hotdog... nothing to get too worked up about BUT they did ask for my original review to be removed! Unbelievable! Some my disagree with this review but do yourself a favor and just make Nathan's at home!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Two big, delicious hot dogs with a great variety of toppings, plus a side plus a drink for about $10. Excellent.   Had the Sonoran (Mexican flavors) and the Joliet Jake (Chicago dog) which were both excellent. The Joliet wasn't the best Chicago style (my favorite) I've had but it was up there. The Sonoran had beans and a salsa and some creama or something.... It doesn't matter. It was perfection.  Homemade chips were well seasoned. They also have a pickle bar (house made) and pickled onions that are exceptional.   Can you tell I liked it?  All dogs are $2 on Tuesdays after 3pm..... Good deal for sure. Regular prices are $4 a dog which I think is fair."}
{"text":"When it comes to a simple yet unique charlotte experience, JJ's kills it every time.. I realize their hot dogs are made in NY.. but their flavor combinations, and their originality are so local - we love bringing our out of town guests for a JJ's hot dog and let them see how a simple hot dog can be elevated to a fun, gourmet experience."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and the prices are as well. There is a pretty big selection of different hotdogs/sausages and if you don't like that, you can build your own. There are plenty of other items on the menu if you're not in the mood for a hotdog.   I got the Chicago style hotdog with a side of onion rings. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you once it's ready so it's like half sit down. The hotdog was pretty good - the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The onion rings were ok - they were extremely greasy which isn't my favorite but I ate them all anyway.   I'll definitely be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the tater tots w the works!!! Definitely a must do! Love  these hotdogs!!!!  Would have given 5 stars except it was seriously hot (temperature of room)"}
{"text":"Best gourmet hotdogs around south charlotte. Pay a little more and get quality with a decent draft selection on a sunny day(they even had a band). Can't really mess up a hotdog, but they make them just a little better for ya."}
{"text":"I came for Yelp restaurant week to grab a quick lunch. The guy at the register helped me with a couple of questions I had, and I decided on the chicken sandwich. *see pic* I was surprised that it came in a hot dog bun, but then it makes sense because this is a hot dog place! I just wish that my sandwich was a little bit bigger. I chose a salad as my side and was disappointed that it was old and wilted... threw it away. My lemonade was great and my sandwich had a great taste...wanted more of it."}
{"text":"I like the casing on the dogs here, and the fact they char them. Had the Carolina dogs, chili was good but the slaw tasted like it was commercially bought not made in house. The slaw was the only negative I have. The home made chip an ranch are awesome! The \"pickle\" bar is pretty cool too"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat hotdogs but these are great!  And the owner is sweet and hilarious!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch. I am not in this area often, but after I left a meeting I needed a quick lunch.  I normally stop at the Dilworth JJ's and was looking forward to trying this location.  Location is okay - tucked away in a non-descript strip mall typical of the area.  They do have a nice little patio.  Inside is typical JJ's  - you order at the counter and they bring it out to you.  I got the 2 dog combo with house chips.  The chips here were pretty good but a little too crispy.  The dogs were great - a JJs #1 and Char-Heel.  Will come back here if I am in the area again as JJ's makes one of the best dogs in the city."}
{"text":"This is an update: Recently went back and the food was much better! I was very impressed. The hot dog wasn't tough at all, and didn't have a burnt taste either. I think they just left them on to long the last time. I will be coming back frequently. I didn't have the onion strings, but I hope they get better the next time as well. Great service as always and the staff is very friendly, and very customer caring."}
{"text":"I had no real expectations of a hot dog place, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  A simple menu with many different dog combinations and sausages though you you can make your own as well.  I opted for the whistle pig while my wife got the Chicago style dog.  Great dogs all around.  The thin crinkle fries were a great side though the onion rings will be on my next combo.  A quick family dinner with good hot dogs that the whole family enjoyed.  We are eager to go back.  What else could we ask for?"}
{"text":"Decent place to get a hot dog. I really like the crinkle cut fries. They used to have a strong game pickle bar, but seem to have less and less offerings each time I return. They also have other menu items if you're not interested in a hotdog."}
{"text":"Wow. I have eaten more hot dogs in the last few months.... thanks JJ's!  You don't sell hot dogs, you sell dreams! Your hot dog creations are the best! My fave is Wiener the Pooh. I mean honey, peanut butter, bacon and sriracha!! Yes please I will have more of that. Dog of the week is great too! Hogtoberfest! !! See you soon."}
{"text":"Favorite hotdog place in the area FOR SURE! The crispy skin on the dogs is great, lots of variety for toppings, and atmosphere is awesome!  Only regret is getting mustard... their yellow mustard has a KICK to it. My fault, not theirs!"}
{"text":"My family's favorite hot dog joint! Kids meals are great and super reasonably priced.  Brats and sausages are some of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Let me just put it out there:  Things I love (in no particular order) :  1. Hot dogs 2. Bacon 3. Cheese   And lucky for me JJ's knows how to put them all together on a super delicious hot dog.   Thanks to Amy C, I scored a free hot dog from their Facebook page so I decided to give the new location a try and see what Ballantyne had to offer. So on Sunday afternoon I popped in, the place was pretty busy but I guess that's always a sign of good food.   No need to review the menu I already knew what I wanted....a WHISTLE PIG and onion rings. Ok, seriously if you like bacon this is the salty goodness hot dog you have been waiting on. I'm hooked.  There was some confusion with my coupon at the counter, but after two cashiers and the manager came over the issue was quickly resolved. And I found a table in right in front of the tv. The setup is similar to the other location, funky decor (yes the drums are still on the ceiling) open kitchen and a bar in the corner.   After a short wait my food arrived, I was a little disappointed in the onion rings. I'm totally a fan of the onion rings because I love how they are so thin and the seasoning is delicious. But on this afternoon they were served up cold. I guess it's because they were so busy, so no problems I just doused them in ketchup. Still good, just wish they had come out hot.   Highlight of the meal...of course was that hot dog. Delish! There was bacon, cheese and mustard with every bite. I am a fan of their buns (hehe) because they are proportionate to the hot dog and it's just plain good stuff. I don't really know another way to put it. YUM!  I'm going to do it. And admit that for now this is my favorite hot dog on the menu.   Now, don't get me wrong there are plenty more for me to try but for now, this holds first place in my heart.   I'm sure you will find me at both locations again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped into JJ's in Ballantyne one Friday afternoon for a quick bite. Ordered the Whistle Pig hotdog and the tater tots that. Came with the Yelp check-in. The tater tots came with burnt bits of sage on all sides that gave them the flavor of Thanksgiving stuffing gone bad. The hotdog was as wrinkled as a shar-pei and unfit for human consumption. A first for me, I actually spit a mouthful in my napkin, threw it away and left. Mic dropped."}
{"text":"Love! Love!  Family friendly for sure. I knew my kids would have no issue eating here. No crying = enjoyable dinner says anyone with a toddler.   I ate the Quarter Hounder as a single meal. I was unsure if I wanted to get two but I was full and satisfied with one.  The secret sauce in my hot dog was EVERYTHING! I wish I would have came up with this super hotdog place. So smart. Did I mention your side order can be Tater Tots... ugh that was the topping on the cake for me. Yum yum    The staff was really nice and super patient while we were trying to figure out what to order. It was clean and cute. They have some outdoor seating... I just looked out at it. I hate eating while sweating :)   This is a place will visit again, for sure. Thank you Yelp for leading me here!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. It has a great vibe and delicious dogs! My favorite is the Chili Cheese Coney! They also have $2 dogs on Tuesdays. I think the name is misleading because we thought it was going to be the nasty red hot dogs my dad would always buy because they were cheaper! We finally decided to just give it a try and I'm super glad we did!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at this location.  The dogs are fresh and the staff loads it up with more than enough toppings.  My last experience came this past June with a lot of laughing as one of the guys who delivers the food had \"sharted\" and had a shit stain on his pants.  My brother was in from MI, my Dad was in from FL and we thought of telling the manager, but didn't think we could do it with a straight face.  We weren't the only ones either because others were laughing as well.  Other than that, I love JJ's."}
{"text":"I will be the first to say that I am not a hot dog fan... I don't eat pork, beef, or any other mammal.  But, I heard they did have a veggie hot dog, so when someone suggested we go there, I was game.   As it turns out, they also have chicken offerings and salads. So, I ended up getting the Sonoran Salad with grilled chicken tenders.  This was comprised of mixed greens, borracho beans, cheese, salsa, tortilla chips and their ranch dressing.  I have to say, I did not have high expectations, but the salad was good... I would definitely order it again.  I also split an order of onion rings and while they were not the best onion rings I have ever had, they were not bad.  The employees working the night I was there were very helpful & friendly.    For a quick casual spot, this is not a bad option... and if you are not a fan of the dogs, don't worry - they also offer the salads, salmon sliders, a Portofino mushroom veggie dog, and a couple of chicken sandwich options.   Oh, and as the other reviewers have mentioned, they have a pretty decent selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"If you have not been here yet you are a IDIOT. 2 dollar Tuesdays is a given. For  2 dollar tuesdays you can select any beer on tap for 2 dollars including local Brewery beers. Which is crazy!! Next up pick any hot dog for 2 dollars and every week they have a dog of the week that will keep you coming back if you like to try new things like i do. Next up get the classics like the Tar heel or the The connie dog. I love these hot dogs and i try to go every tuesday with my crew."}
{"text":"You people must not know or like good hot dogs.  JJ's is a grease pit on their onion rings and the dogs well lets just say they bark."}
{"text":"I've been a longstanding fan of the East Blvd location...since the day they opened....and before. Happy to report it's the same, kick-ass menu with a bit of a different backdrop and layout. It's really cool to see this young concept spreading their wings to the ol' land of Ballantyne and they've carved out a nice piece of the adjacent shopping/eating center to Ballantyne Village.   It's nice. Like.....really nice. For the concept, I can't think of any other branding that has as much attention to detail as these guys. The place is just pretty and easy on the eyes. The aft entrance is so slick with all of the different kinds of signs and angles. A brand/company that adjusts their look slightly based on the location typically has a good eye for their customer base. Good show, ladies and gents.   We got our most recent meal to go and it was my first time doing so. It was such a stellar experience. My wife called in our order, for 6 hungry mouths mind you, and they gave us pickup time of 15 minutes. We arrived almost exactly 15 minutes later and there our food was in one bag. Done.   Glad to see these guys in the Ballantyne area and doing what they do best -- Hot Dogs."}
{"text":"Okay; not a culinary hot spot but come on, it's hot dogs at the finest.  This local business makes their own sausages and sides from scratch.  I'm a big eater but 2 dogs are hard to finish.  You get your bang for your buck here,  Beer selection top notch too. Enjoy when you need your dog fix!"}
{"text":"Good hot dog and condiments.  Great homemade chips.  Friendly staff and manager. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"This is a good solid place to grab a hotdog or sausage when you need a bite to eat and need it somewhat quickly. We tried the Sonoran hotdog-- tasty, but not really anything amazing. I'd probably enjoy the beans that were on it better if I'd ordered them as a side. We also had the Kasekreiner sausage combo and it was really good. More filling than the hotdog as well. We chose the onion rings as the side and while they were thin and crispy the way I like them and had good flavor, they also were a bit on the greasy side.   The other drawback was that we chose to dine in and most of the tables needed to be wiped down.   All in all, I'd consider popping in for lunch if I were in the area again. The price was right and the food good for the price."}
{"text":"Great hotdog joint. Fast service, good prices and good eats. Really good ole crinkle cut fries to. Nice little area to dine outside when the weather permits."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a buddy suggested it. I'm not a SUPER big hot dog fan, but I must say these were good. The service was very friendly and quick, and the place was clean. It's a perfect spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Wieners. Weenies. Dogs. Sausages. And of course Red Hots! There a lots of words to refer to a hot dog. But JJ's Red Hots takes hot dogs to a whole new level. I've seen many-a-check-in from fellow Yelpers and I finally had to see for myself and I was so glad I did  The hubby and I ventured in on a Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't really that busy and it allowed us to really take our time studying the menu.  I finally settled on The Whistle Pig (bacon, duh!) and B settled on the Sonoran. Our sides consisted of the housemade chips and onion rings.   I was super happy with my order and as I sat there, I was trying to figure out when our next visit would be - especially with prices so reasonable!  The staff was super nice and the service was fast! JJ's - we'll be back!  And don't forget to check in before you order - a free onion ring basket!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something quick and inexpensive, and we've been wanting to try JJ's for a while. For about $6.50 I got a Coney Chili Cheese dog with onion rings and a drink. When the food was ready, I was actually surprised by how much I got for the price. The hotdog was good and the onion rings were very good. My wife got the fries which were not bad either. It's not every day that I'm in the mood for a hotdog, but next time I am, we'll be back at JJ's."}
{"text":"So I heard via Yelp, Radio and TV that this was the the place for the best hotdogs in town ....  And  so it was game on to see . The menu was extensive... so plan a minute or two to decide....   So I tried the \"Char-heel\" with a side of free tots  (compliments of Checking in on Yelp) !   Ever bite of the hotdog had hotdog in it. There were no empty bun bites as the dog was a wee bit longer than the bun. The bun didn't overpower the dog. The chili and slaw that topped it were placed inside and on top of  the bun thus guaranteeing it to be in ever bite you take.  The dog was grilled and flavorful!  The free tots were delicious... not sure if it was cause they were free but seriously they were simply delicious! Not over fried or greasy. They were light and crisp and just delicious !  The over all opinion is this place IS ever bit as good as I've heard!   Two thumbs way up !"}
{"text":"I went to JJ's hoping to find a great hot dog. At first I tried the Señoran dog but it was far from the authentic ones in Arizona. I was a little more impressed by the chili cheese dog but not for the price. A good but not great dog but not worth a special trip... I originally was going to give this a 2 star rating but I was very impressed with how JJ's handled my feedback. Based on the fact that they clearly care about how they are perceived by their customers I believe that 3 stars is a more appropriate rating."}
{"text":"They're so nice. The first time I came through it was like 5 minutes before closing time and they were still super nice. Food was still hot and they were accommodating.   Sooo I'm craving things I don't normally crave and although my dude was getting a salad trying to be on the healthy side, I still had to appease the fat girl (or pregnant me)... So I had to get me some dogs.   Now I used to make boiled hot dogs in the kitchen. You know, something quick and tasty, but who really wants a woogly wiener??? Surely not I. I love that they grill their wieners until they're a little charred. I like a little burntness for some flava.   Char-Heel is my fave!!! Perhaps I'm biased being I'm a semi-Carolina gal. But I love me some chili and slaw... Pretty much on anything... Burgers, hot dogs, pizza, ice cream... Okay just hot dogs and burgers. Add some mustard to that bad boy and what else is needed? Seriously, if this is your style such as mine... Get It!   The other dog, (check the pic) is pretty good. I couldn't finish it since I'm experiencing pregnancy symptoms and really need something fresh when I eat... Hence the reason why my other dog was good. The freshness from the cole slaw almost made me feel like I was eating something healthy.  Basically, whatever your taste buds are craving, you can't go wrong. Burnt hot dogs... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This was ok. My hotdog was very dry. Location is small but cute. This restaurant has a bar which is different."}
{"text":"I really on including a picture to got with this review but by the time I remembered I found this on yelp, I was 3/4 of the way thru my first dog. I got one with sauerkraut, relish and mustard and the other with cheese and bacon and cheese fries. My only regret is I don't have a larger stomach! The iced tea was great, not overly sweet and really set off by the lemon I added to my cup. The cheese on the fries was incredible and I claim to be a guy who doesn't really \"do fries\" for healths sake, but I found myself devouring all of the fries and using my hot dog to wipe up the rest of my cheeses I didn't try any desserts but my next trip will definitely include something from that part of the menu.  If your in this area, I would stop in for a great lunch that won't leave you broke, but very, very full."}
{"text":"Great place to get an excellent hotdog or sausage.  The only reason they got 4-stars is because they have 2 TVs and they're only viewable from a few seats.  Other than that,  they're totally 5-star!"}
{"text":"JJ's has developed quite the reputation for specialty hot dogs in Charlotte, and it's well-deserved. For $10 I had a handcrafted Double Dog Plate with a Chicago-style dog, a Carolina-style dog and fries, as well as a drink and selections from the serve-yourself pickle bar. The hot dogs themselves were premium quality beef, with fresh toppings aplenty. I especially liked the slaw and chili on the Char Heel (Carolina style). The fries were like mini crinkle-cuts, crispy and yet still potatoey. What a delicious Plate. And I love the counter service and table delivery format. Takes the pressure off tipping in a tight-budget age for diners!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Tons of veggie options for my wife. Excellent atmosphere and fresh taste. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Go get a hotdog!! Great onion rings! Try different ones each time you go! Very well priced. They have a bar as well if you would like an alcohol beverage."}
{"text":"Fun hot dog place. Lots of toppings and other menu items like chicken tenders, sausage, and love their thin onion rings. The dogs are nothing special which is why I give it 4 stars. But the topping creations makes the difference and fun experience. And they serve beer too!"}
{"text":"As a fan of the East Blvd location, I very much enjoyed my visit to the brand-spankin'-new Ballantyne location.  Decorated well, great seating and views of the fountain.  And as with the East Blvd location, the overall dining experience is a 3.5 that I am rounding up in hopes that I just haven't had the right dog/side combo yet.  Located in Ballantyne right next to the McAlister's (on the same side as Libretto's and the burger joint that shan't be named), they did a fab job of turning the place into a dog joint.  Comfy seating throughout and expedient service.  From their FB page, I got a coupon for a free dog (go there now and get the coupon, free wieners are a good thing!), and since I am eating like they are taking me to the gas chamber until my Nutrisystem torture plan gets here, I decided to get 2 dogs and onion rings.    The food: I had previously had the Chili Cheese Coney at the East Blvd location so I ordered that again, no onions.  The dog is good - good char, snappy skin.  Bun is fine, but their chili just doesn't get me all atwitter.  It's meh.  And I wish they had a better melting cheese, as the cheese that is sprinkled doesn't melt, it just kind of sits on top of the chili.  I added ketchup, it was fine. The Whistle Pig - dog with BACON, cheese, onions and mustard - I had them skip the onions and mustard.  Big pieces of bacon that covered the entire dog, though rather chewy.  Again with the shredded cheese, no melting.  Dog was grilled/charred well, bun was fine, bacon and cheese combo (I added ketchup) was good.  I liked this better than the chili cheese coney. Onion rings - incredibly greasy.  I mean, I am eating hot dogs and fried sides, so obviously I am not on a health kick, but the onion rings were crazy greasy soaking through the wax paper and coating everything it touched.  Thin cut onions with a crunchy, well flavored batter.  I only ate a few before the oily taste just became too much.  I do like the dogs at JJ's, so I an going to keep trying combos until I find one I like.  A dog, side and fountain drink combo is $5.99, so it is reasonable.  They have Coke products to drink (Cherry Coke - YAY!).  There is also a pickle bar with some very interesting choices - the quick pickles are yummy."}
{"text":"Received the scolding from the owner, Jonathan L., that I missed the point and took it in stride. Although owners and business partners are touchy when they hear other than positive comments, those unsolicited and frank comments give businesses information that might help them grow and thrive.  So sad when businesses falter and go away with the owners saying, \"But everyone we asked said it was OK\"!  Yelp! can be very useful if a business is interested on just how their business is perceived by the anonymous public.  So the reviewing journey continues.  My wife and I just returned from a month in Iceland.  We rented a car and drove the island where hot dogs are the rave.  Everywhere you go there are hot dogs.  Gas stations, separate booths, in malls and along just about any street.  We are not hot dog fans and were stunned as how popular they are there and I thought of frequently about JJ's Ballantyne.  Well, I GOT IT.  The Icelanders sell a so-so hot dog, but, like JJ's they have lots and lots of TOPPINGS, which, similar to JJ's is what they want and what they cherish.    Some of the popular toppings were unusual, like white tartar sauce and those canned fried onions and other sauces along with the standard mustards (plural intended) and onions, chopped tomato and other veggies.  Icelanders put quite a load of things on their dogs because the hot dog is only a vehicle for the toppings.  The toppings are the thing.  I GOT IT!  So my son and I were out and there was a JJ's on East Boulevard in Charlotte.  We ordered and on their roof top tried three different selections along with just a plain bun and regular dog.  And of course, beer is the perfect hot dog beverage.  The dogs themselves were OK, but once you doctored them with whatever you liked they went down well and we were passing them back and forth to experience them all.  You can read my review on that location and in it I am clear in stating, hopefully to the satisfaction of Jonathan L., the miffed Ballantyne proprietor, I GOT IT.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/jjs-red-hots-ballantyne-charlotte?hrid=cWiEsnjM5FoXIPj8Dzl1vg  If you like unusual hot dogs or I should say hot dogs with clever, unique, themed toppings and/or have children with you, JJ's is the place."}
{"text":"All diffent kinds of dogs, had the italian sausage with pintos. It was all great, small but good beer selection. $2.00 drafts on Tuesday! Not a lot of bar crowd but great starter place."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at JJ's. The hot dogs are great. They are so good that I actually order something called the Char Heel every time despite my hatred of UNC-CH. It's a Sunday tradition to go there with my son for lunch. Today the staff went above and beyond with just the little touch of catching his name when I said it and calling him by name. Really made him feel like a rock star and that's what moves a good business into being a great one"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here, and I will come back whenever I am in this area. The hotdogs were terrific both times - good flavor, texture, and preparation - and the buns very fresh and tender. I don't get lots of toppings, because I like the hotdogs and I like to really taste whatever topping I do get and not have too many things going on at once. This time it was sauerkraut, and it was a generous amount and just to my liking. The big surprise, though, were the onion rings. I love onion rings, but too often find them really disappointing.  Not this time! To begin with, the onions are sliced fresh for each order (the taste and texture told me that, but I also asked staff members, who verified my guess). Next, they are sliced very thin, the way some places do for a garnish. Third, the batter was light and had a nice seasoning that didn't overpower the fresh, sweet, onion flavor. Finally, they were cooked to a crispy perfection, neither under or over done. I'm glad I hadn't had breakfast that day, because otherwise I could not have finished my meal. It was my lunch, and I skipped supper that night. Finally, the staff members were friendly and seemed to care that I got a good meal.  I did!"}
{"text":"Hands down, JJ's is the best tasting hot dog I have ever had. I generally don't choose items with a ton of toppings and went for the all beef hot dog but everything tasted fresh and the staff was incredibly accommodating in portioning off the condiments so my to-go order wouldn't be soggy by the time I got home. Plus, they've got cherry soda!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good hot dog and this place delivered.  The hot dog itself has a good snap to it and the topping selections are diverse and delicious.  Love me some Chicago style.  Also, you cannot go wrong with the tots."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in a year or so, but doggonit, the Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives piece (and a buy one get one free coupon) stoked my interest. The dining area is attractive and nostalgic, and includes a great little bar set off separate from the eating area. Sanitation rating was 97 and service was friendly and fast. Customers order at the counter and food is delivered to your table.  I went with a Triple D Combo for $12.95 before coupon. It consists of a Chili Cheese Coney Dog (with chili, onions and shredded cheese), the house-made Kasekreiner (Austrian beef and pork sausage stuffed with Emmentaler cheese topped with kraut, diced pickle red onion and house-made horseradish), both on delicious buns, that were more than just an afterthought. Both dogs were tasty but the sausage was especially so.  The Soon-To-Be-Famous Onion Rings are aptly named and deserve their own paragraph. They are light, sweet, thinly sliced and melt in your mouth. Of course, they are also a bit greasy but hey, I'm at a hot dog joint! I didn't come here to lower my cholesterol and blood pressure. I knew what I was getting into. For the record, they do sell chicken sandwiches and tenders.  I also like the pickle station, and found little to complain about, even the fountain drinks had a good mix. It's not a Gotta Try in my book, but it is pretty doggone good."}
{"text":"This was a shot in the dark, but a pleasant surprise! Great atmosphere, excellent, char-grilled hot dogs and a very nice staff. Fries were krinkle-cut and had just the right amount of crunch and plenty of salt.  The dogs? Snap, good toppings and plenty big enough to fill an empty gut on a cold and wet day. Great job, JJ's!"}
{"text":"I like the location in Dilworth better. Hot dogs seem freshly grilled there. This location is more spacious but the hot dogs don't seem as quality as the Dilworth location. Regardless we still love JJ's. Excellent service here!"}
{"text":"Very good. I enjoy their hotdogs. I do wish they would make a simple cheap ($2.00) \"regular\" Carolina (chili & slaw) dog. Why not give it a try and see how the sales go? Call it the 'low dog'. I still like the idea of getting 3 dogs and a coke for $7.00 for lunch. If they had that option this place would be gold. It reminds me of this bar that served the beer at room temperature and then when I complained they said \"That is the correct temperature for serving beer.\" What? The correct temperature for serving beer is the temperature the customer wants the beer to be served at. Same for hotdogs. (BTW that bar is no longer in business - go figure).  I understand the concept is to 'raise' the lowly hot dog to higher standards but at $4 for a hotdog they are competing with subway ($4 for 6 inch sub and a coke). It is just difficult when I'm thinking about lunch to choose one hot dog over a 6\" sub. To me - every lunch compares to subway. Just because subway is the value leader. haha (Taco Bell is the dinner comparison)."}
{"text":"I don't know, like, this place is ok. Sahlen's hot dogs are good anywhere, but here they burn them. I like a good grilled casing but these are a little past that threshold. The bun was good. I like bread so I'm easy to please there. The toppings are, well, I mean they are toppings. They're not amazing and they're not bad, they just are. I like cheese/bacon/onions in any form so I'm still easy here.  We got the onion rings and side salad. The salad was alright, it's cheap and from a hot dog joint so I'm not going to complain.   Them onion rings though. Boyyyy let's talk about these things. Hot garbage 100%. Super oily (though still crunchy, props to ya for achieving that). They don't taste like anything. I don't get it. The batter looks super flavorful, so even though I can't taste any onion I was expecting something in the batter. The only flavor in these was some super hard core black pepper.  I don't know, guys. Dinner was cheap. It's a hot dog joint. I'm being to picky I guess, but it just wasn't that great. Darn you, Guy Fieri, this is not the Flavortown I was looking for..."}
{"text":"Good hotdogs, good service. Check them out for a tasty meal under $10! Can't go wrong with the chilli cheese Coney."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dog joint with classic and modern takes on toppings. Cool vibe and nice bar area. We went today on July 4th, because... duh, right? The staff was very helpful and pleasant. I messed up our order (I repeat, entirely my fault) and they made it right promptly and without question. They really made an average experience excellent. Can't recommend enough. Important to note that it's not a cheap price-point, but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"The staff was excellent !  Very clean and the food was ok. I was just not a fan of quarter hounder, but char heel was not bad. My kids weren't fans of the puppy dawgs. But my kids are picky about everything.In my opinion I thought they tasted pretty good. I really enjoyed the onion rings . I will be coming back to try some of the other options on the menu.  Oh and  They have a BAR !"}
{"text":"I very rarely get in the mood for a dog but I wanted to try JJ's so I made the trek this afternoon.   First of all enough with condiment graffiti already! The mustard belongs belongs on the bun with the dog bathing in it, not on top the sauerkraut and onions!!  Service was very good and they obliged my request with a smile.   The dog itself was good, not the best I've had which was from Chicago but the quality is certainly better than what you get from a typical street cart. I was a bit disappointed because I like my dogs grilled, this one was somewhat grilled on the outside but it tasted boiled (full of water) inside.    The sauerkraut was fresh (as in fresh out of the can)  but totally bland and the chopped onions raw, I should have skipped those.  $4 seemed a bit high for what it was.     The fries looked real, with skin and all but tasted nothing like it -more like salty cardboard. As starved as I was (by that time it was 2:30pm) I couldn't eat them. Now I'm out of $7 so I'm less impressed.   I ordered the bratwurst and let me tell you : Waldhorn has nothing to fear from JJs. It was OK, not great, expensive at $6 and topped again with kraut so bland they don't even use peppercorns when cooking it.   With taxes and tip I spent around $15 and drank tap water. It's not often that I buy a hotdog and end up wishing I had gone to a German restaurant instead but there you have it."}
{"text":"Their dogs and tater tot's are out of there and swirled. And the flavor options are fabulous. Since you don't have a comment card or a messenger on Facebook I guess I'll have to leave it in my review I wish y'all had a gluten-free bun option even if it's a slight up charge. I also wish y'all had a large drink option especially for to go orders because I know in the restaurant y'all offer a free refills. Other than that I love your restaurant and your hot dogs"}
{"text":"First of all....Hats off if you can keep a business a float selling Hotdogs...I don't know how they do it but more power to them.  - The Good: The staff is friendly and it's a great location with good seating and good atmosphere. The hotdog had good flavor and was well charred. The chili on the hotdog was good as well. - The Bad: I could probably state this and be done with the review but for me it really is a total buzz kill that you are using some generic ketchup. I first thought my fries were bad until I figured out it was the generic ketchup I was dipping them into....tasted like sugar and vinegar. It was horrible. Bring your packets of Heinz if you go!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  It is always the kids first choice when we ask what they want. Best hotdogs around!"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned hot dog joint that takes great care with everything from their ingredients to their decor. Their specialty dogs are all great and once you've tried them all you will come back for their always inventive DOW (dog of the week). Top it all off with a milkshake. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers, I was excited to have JJ's in the neighborhood and even more excited to have a coupon for a free dog, so a friend of mine and I ventured over on a Friday at lunch.  We met at noon, and it took us forever to find parking.  JJ's is on the backside of Ballantyne Commons East (around from Bad Daddy's), and the parking is pretty limited.  In we went!  I love the decor the place - aluminum chairs, fun splashes of red, TVs in the corners, some high top tables and some low tops.  You order at the counter, and they give you a number.  I love hot dogs, bacon and cheese, so I only had to look as far as the Whistle Pig!  When the woman behind the counter asked which side I wanted, I asked her opinion, and she immediately said onion rings.  Yum.  My friend tried to be a little healthier and got the chicken tenders with a side salad, but this was my cheat meal for the week, so I was all in!  Our food came out promptly, and I immediately chowed down.  I loved that they put most of the condiments you'd need on the table so I didn't have to keep getting up and down for ketchup, mustard, etc.  As excited as I was about the hot dog, I bit in and... eh.  It was a little overcooked for my taste, and the onion rings were most like onion strings (thin and stringy instead of big ol' circular hunks of onion, like I like) that were too greasy so the batter was falling off.  None of this stopped me from eating everything in basket, but I have to say, I was a little disappointed.    I really appreciated that the employees came and cleared our trash and asked if we needed anything else, and I loved the feel of the place and the decor, but the food was a little underwhelming.  I was pretty bummed I'd eaten that as my cheat meal, but maybe my tastes just aren't what they provide?  It was bad, and if you like a more well-done dog and onion strings, it might be right up your alley."}
{"text":"An  all american hot dog and more !  There is nothing more relaxing than sitting down and enjoying what I consider a classic. The hot dog. At JJ's Red Hots they have just that, and more. You can peruse the menu and enjoy a basic Sahlen's  hot dog and fries . You are also able to choose from a list of specialty hot dogs like  \"The Char Heel\" , or the \"Dirty Jerz\" . They also have one of the best Bratwurst that I have enjoyed  ever.  The tater tots are very good and help round out any of the entrees. There is a selection of house made pickles .They vary this theme by offering pickled carrots, onions  that are delicious. They offer traditional, bread and butter, or spicy selections from the pickle bar. The restaurant is clean. I like the fact that the wait staff are out in the dining room wiping down and cleaning tables without being told to do so.  This is also a fun place to watch a Pro or college game on TV. There is a nice bar area and wide screen TVs to watch your favorite team play.  Give them a try for lunch, dinner you will become a fan too."}
{"text":"Great place! The Royal with Cheese is a dog to get a hold of! An explosion of flavors with the andouille sausage, blu cheese, grilled onions and spicy mustard. Make sure you get yourself one of their delicious milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"absolutley obsessed with this place. to the point of being unhealthy! :)  everything is fantastic - and i think about it all day long! ;)  the chips with homeade dip - their awesome & original hot dogs - cant get enough!"}
{"text":"This is a great place in Ballantyne to stop for a quick lunch. The foos tastes excellent and prices are OK. Sometimes they get too busy but overall a perfect place for families also."}
{"text":"Went in the early afternoon. I know it sounds crazy to say the fried onion rings were greasy, but there was a pool of grease at the bottom of the container. You can fry food with out it coming out saturated with oil. Yuck. The fixings for the hot dog were better than the actual hot dog. Maybe my timing was off. I don't feel the need to return. So many better options out there."}
{"text":"Hot dog joint. Fast service. I'm from NY so the best dogs in my opinion will always be Nathan's, Hebrew National and Sabretts. I would return if I just had a taste for one."}
{"text":"How disappointing!! I ordered a chili dog with onions and cheese. First of all, the hotdog was chewy as in overcooked with a smidgen of chili. It was more like an essence of chili. I kept thinking the next bite would contain more, but NO it didn't. And before you know it, 4 boring bites later, the $5 hot dog was gone! Won't be back."}
{"text":"We are always pleased with our orders and service. The staff is always attentive and courteous and since we have changed or orders to \"lightly charred\" we have never had a bad Dog! They also do a great job keeping the fries from getting too greasy"}
{"text":"JJ's is one of my favorite places to go.  Great prices on beer.  Yingling, PBR, Natie Bo twelve ounce cans are only a buck.  You can't go wrong with No. 1 dog or the Mad Dog.  The red chili is to die for.  If you are looking for a kid friendly place that sells adult beverages then JJ'S is the place."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, and interesting offerings - the hot dogs themselves are always good. I'd like to see better-prepared sides (e.g. mushy french fries, uninspired chilly) and better service - it's a little spotty."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty.   I ordered a double dog combo Joliet jake(tomatoes, sport peppers, diced onions, relish, celery salt, mustard, and a pickle spear)  I subbed grilled onions for the diced onions  Grilled onions and peppers are considered a premium topping at .49. They charged me .50.  I dislike paying a premium for a hot dog to begin with and then being charged for subbing something without being refunded for the regular topping (.25)."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of JJ's on East Blvd, but never been to this location. It's just as good as the original, with a nice twist that they have a bigger draft selection. Great, real Sahlens hotdogs with traditional & new creations. The Royale with Cheese is a blue cheese infused brat with a locally made blue cheese pimento cheese & topped with ground mustard & grilled onions. One of the best sausage dogs I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. The staff are attentive and always busy... Checking to make sure all is clean and good. If I can offer anything (for both locations), it would be a nice addition if they had dill relish. Go Panthers!"}
{"text":"Hella good come here every two weeks I love that you get to customize everything you order."}
{"text":"Hot dogs in Ballantyne? You betcha. Colleague and I came here on a whim, looked at the menu briefly before heading to the bar.   Once I saw the taps, I was sold. Bells Two Hearted? Check. Allagash White? Check. Avery Salvation? Check. Sierra Tumbler? Check. Seriously impressive pound for pound tap handles, with three canned CO beers to boot - Dales pale Ale, Fate Tire and the biggest treat of the evening - Avery Ellie's Brown.  And then there was the food. Solid Chicago dog and a delicious Char Heel(chili, slaw, onions, mustard), along with fresh house battered onion rings.  Will be back."}
{"text":"First of all, I REALLY want to like JJ's. They have a great concept, a cool and clever menu, and a good atmosphere. They seem to be really involved in the community and use and sell a lot of local products (Local Beer, King of Pops, etc.)   We have been 3 times now, and really just find it to be sub-par for our expectations. We have tried various dogs and sandwiches. Most recently, we both had the \"signature dog\" with Chili, onions, beans, bacon, jalapeños and mustard. We found the Chili and beans to be lacking in any flavor whatsoever. The bun and hot dog were high quality, and the hot dog gave that nice \"snap\" when you bit in. Despite all of those delicious sounding ingredients, we found it to be a bit pedestrian.    We also split a side of onion rings, which were greasy and flavorless. We each took a bite and decided to throw the rest away.   Overall, just disappointed.  I hope in time, JJ's becomes the Charlotte institution that it could be."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Great beers.big patio. Very nice folks who work there and and will tell you how everything is"}
{"text":"The hot dogs were dry, burnt, flavorless and the buns were pre-packaged Costco buns (not made fresh in house). Weinersnitchel hot dogs can easily outclass this place at $1.69 each.   It boggles my mind how this place has an average 4 star review. Maybe everyone in the South has never had a good hot dog. Poor folks.   The only positives I experienced were the strawberry shake and the Cherry Coke.   To be perfectly clear, I've had hot dogs at Costco that were far superior to these.   I'll be amazed if this place is still in business 5 years from now if they keep cranking out these flavorless, dry, and cheaply made products."}
{"text":"Overall a decent hotdog spot. I had the \"Double Dog\" combo where it is 12.99 for two dogs and a side. A little pricey for the quality honestly. I could make these better from my own kitchen an a pack of Ballparks. Super friendly staff. Good atmosphere. Not worth the amount of money but it is not a bad place to eat for some average hotdogs. The chips... I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by the hot dogs. I went in with high expectations of a gourmet dog place and the only mildly impressive thing was the presentation. The dogs were luke warm and the cheese on my dog wasn't melted. The cheese fries had a gravy like substance on them that was less than appetizing. The only upside was it was clean and the staff was pleasant. The hot dogs weren't anything I couldn't have made on my own grill at home."}
{"text":"Not a restaurant. It's a hot dog joint and proud to be it. Delicious and very very tasty. Fast friendly service and who can argue with a pickle bar."}
{"text":"Good solid food. The folks are super nice and always get my order right. The onion rings are superb!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay.  During my first visit ,the pop machine was broken and it was really dirty.  The food was just alright like I said.  The hotdogs and brats were nothing special and were clearly over boiled because they were really squishy .   The fries were burned and rock hard.  The onion rings, however, were fantastic .   All in all, I suppose I'd possibly come back but there was nothing about the food here that I couldn't do in my own kitchen for the same price in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"It was pretty good... Dogs were awesome, had the onions rings for side but kinda disappointed- mostly breading on very thin rings... for the price it was really good"}
{"text":"Dry, flavorless, stale tasting hot dogs. I would not recommend this place at all. There aren't many hot dog places in Charlotte, so there is nothing pushing this place to be fresh and step up their game."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon to grab lunch with the kids.  You have a choice of ordering at the counter or sitting at a table and getting served.  Since the bartender greeted us as we walked in (nice how they put the bar right there) and it had been a long morning on the football practice field...we opted to sit at the high top table in the bar area and be served.  Chad the bartender/waiter was very helpful and attentive.  The son was excited because he was able to sit at watch the Xgames that were on the TVs.  We ordered The Joilte Jake (Chicago style) and the Sonoran (Southwestern Style). Son ordered kids chicken fingers and daughter ordered Puppy Dogs (think mini battered and fried dogs).  We also had a coupon for Chili Cheese Chips.  All was really good!  Hot dogs were cooked just right and the topping were fresh and very good.  Bun was not soggy - that happens when you have too much \"wetness\" on top.  Chili Cheese Chips were really good and probably crispier than if we had ordered the Chili Cheese Fries.  Kids both liked their meals, though the kids chicken tenders only had 2 tenders and that wasn't enough for the 10 year old who had 2 hour football practice.  My son asked the owner, John, if it was supposed to be 3 tenders and he said no, just two, but said he would hook him up and he did!  2 more tenders..very nice. We spoke to John and very nice guy, used to write food reviews for the Charlotte Observer (likes the Yelp community!!)  The price was good and we had a look at their salads as they went cruising by and they are very large.  We will definitely be coming back!!  They have a full bar and TVs inside...There is also outdoor patio season and they are going to do some special things for football season..nice spot in Ballantyne East shopping center...on the back side (not facing Harris Teeter), next to McAlisters.  Patio has a view of the fountain."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in town. Always fantastic tasting and there are a million ways you can have yours. They have sausage dogs as well. Quick service and they make their pickles in house. Yumm"}
{"text":"Great dogs! Lots of choices. Would like to see avocado as a topping choice and pico de gallo too. Would also like to see foot long hot dog as a choice. Dirty jerz was yum. Enjoyed the white hot though still prefer zwigels as a fave.  Was excited about hand cut fries but they were beyond crispy and dry and we like them crisp.  Will go back again. Nice to know the dogs and sausages are gluten free."}
{"text":"Business ran out of fries during dinner hours on national hot dog day...ice machine...no ice. They knew this and never refilled it. Customers had to ask for ice and it was rationed. One register open so it was a wait to order...just ratchet!"}
{"text":"Now this is some good food. Pretty good bang for your buck. I have stopped here twice for lunch and it just seems to get better and better. They have wifi which is really nice. The fries are really good and their homemade lemonade is delicious. I have yet to go wrong with selecting a different type of hotdog. I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The best place to get hotdogs. I'm sure everything on the menu is just as phenomenal, but I just can't seem to order anything besides the hotdogs every time I go!  My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place and I am so glad we did. We go weekly and take other people every time.   I never would've imagined that I would put these crazy toppings on a hotdog. But I tried a hotdog with pimento cheese and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it? Order the big cheesy when you go!  Tuesdays are the best night to go. All regular dogs are $2 and all draft beers are $2. It's not the cheap beer either - they serve local craft beers.  If you haven't been you're really missing out!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  If you are originally from Buffalo, NY... GO HERE!!!!!  You'll know why!  Food is delicious and service was amazing.  Owner was dining and was super approachable and down to earth!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to JJ's and I am equally as impressed as the first time. Try the borracho nachos. They are made with thin, round potato fries rather than chips and they are SO good. This place is a great value, you really get your money's worth in both portion size and flavor. Great customer service too. Keep it up you guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The onion rings are perfection. Super flavorful onion with a light non over powering batter. Served with a side of house made ranch for dipping. Pairs perfectly. I had the char heel. As a Carolina raised girl, I am always a fan of a slaw and chili topping on my dogs. Had that perfect pop you want when biting into a dog. Delicious. We will be back for sure! Best hot dogs in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Saw JJ's reviewed in Our State magazine so drove to the Ballantyne location from Monroe.  Friendly staff, good atmosphere, excellent dogs.  Worth the drive for sure."}
{"text":"The Chicago dog is straight from The Windy City. The onion rings are from somewhere else -- out of this world.   Food is really well done. Staff is always friendly and helpful.   Get here, and get yourself some redhots!"}
{"text":"Great dog! Try the chicago style dog or the homemade chili and cheese. Just the right amount of chili sauce, not sloppy with chili. Also pickup a bottle of cheerwine like a cherry coke but better. If your hungry and I was this is a great place to eat sit down fast food. Ambience is very informal and fun."}
{"text":"My husband goes to JJ's with co-workers for lunch and then raves about it, but this was the first visit for our 1.5-year old and me. It's just as good as my husband describes. The menu is great, the beer selection is top notch, the staff is first class. Seriously -- whoever is responsible for the hiring has a lot to be proud of. There is even a good amount of vegetarian and chicken options. JJ's is a fun idea pulled off flawlessly."}
{"text":"Well, some of us can admit when we we're wrong. Is that one of these cases? Who knows? Where was I? Oh, yes! Updating my review for JJRH. I was fully prepared this time for my return.  I was prepared that it was going to be expensive. Taking some time to carefully review the menu, I \"mistakenly\" settled on the gut-filling Double Dog Combo with the World Famous Yelp Dog and The Joliet Jake as well as the fresh made tater chips and and an ice cold bottle of water.  I wasn't a fan of the Jake dog - didn't hate it, didn't love it, but I was surely impressed with the flavors of Abby's Yelp Dog!  Place is clean and employees are very friendly!   TIP: Check out the Pickle Bar!"}
{"text":"The \"new\" JJ's location (which isn't really all that new any longer) is a nice addition, since you don't have to head all the way to East Boulevard to get a dog.  Of course all the usual suspects are there, and just as usual, they are all tasty, but it's the good old Char Heel that is the star of the show. It's not that any of the others are bad - just that the Char Heel is the champion.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a dog, or even if you think you might be - not the regular old hot dog from when you were a kid."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. Good bit of options on the menu. Hot dogs are delicious. I love their pickle pepper bar. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a fun place w great food.  We were visiting the area from SC, and really enjoyed a very casual night out w our little girl.  Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner a few months back. I ordered the Char Heel and loved it. They also have a small bar with side items like pickles and jalepenos.  I was pleasantly surprised to see there was a local musician performing on a small stage. It really added to the atmosphere. I'm not sure on what nights they do this though.  Overall, it was affordable, had a great atmosphere and simple but tasty hot dogs."}
{"text":"So first, it was hot. And yeah I understand. If it gets too hot, then the AC breaks and it's just uncomfortable to eat, and I don't mind.   The gentleman who rang as cashier seemed that he didn't want to be there and didn't seem to acknowledge me or any of the other guests. Coming as a young restaurant manager, interaction between guest and employee is very important.  The food was alright for hot dogs. The JJ's No. 1 Red Hot was very good, messy, and I enjoyed it. The Sonoran was okay at best. Maybe it's just me, but the beans didn't really give it the taste i would have liked. But it's my first time so it wasn't all too bad. May consider going in again, but on a cooler day."}
{"text":"I have been to JJ's before,never Ballantyne location.Always pleased,not today-weenie's crunchy black.As bad as the food was the sticky floors (my shoes kept sticking)and General lack of anything clean-really turned us off.hotdogs yes,but never from JJ's Red hots in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I grew up on sahlen's hot dogs and this place is a slice of home. Great food, especially for Western New Yorkers!"}
{"text":"Great dogs and awesome beer prices. Definitely a family joint where kids can be kids and moms and dads can breath easy. Never overly busy - I hope this isn't a sign of it being at risk...... Definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Good spot to get a charred dog. They have cheap beer as well. Great crinkle  fries, tots, and onion rings. The chili and slaw mix really well on the Char Heel. Consistent every visit."}
{"text":"I am a fan! I came with one other person and together, we were full off of a $10 meal.  We got the double dog combo. It's 2 dogs (doesn't matter how many toppings you get), a side and a drink! They were very generous with us and gave us 2 cups for beverages. Their toppings are limited but I enjoyed the grilled onions and peppers and the cilantro lime crema.   I've read many reviews on the onion rings. They were just alright to me. While the portion is generous, they were lacking in flavor and there was so much oil and grease! You feel kind of gross after eating them. I would recommend trying something else. Other than that, I'll definitely come back! Especially for $2 Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This location is great! I love the bar area, I really think it's a good idea.  The restaurant is huge with a really nice layout.  It's open, inviting and comfortable.  Everything is neat, clean, and well organized.  The food comes out hot and fresh.  The employees are very attentive and nice.  I recommend trying there homemade lemonade. It's surprisingly refreshing.  There are tvs here and it's an ideal choice for a quick bite or game day!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hotdogs and combo and menu prices are decent. My only issue is that I literally watched one of the guys touch my boyfriends hotdog with his barehand. I was going to ask for a new one but my boyfriend wasn't bothered. His appetite was ruined however when he began to eat the tater tots which were over salted. Also the food was pretty eh for all the hype."}
{"text":"Hot dogs were big and juicy, I could only finish one. The fries were crispy and the sweet tea was good. The cheesy tater tots tasted like the cheese had beer in it. That flavor was a little odd, but good. I'd def go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place for the friendly staff and good value. Regular prices are reasonable, but $2 Tuesday is an unbeatable deal for a dinner out. The beer selection is very nice, they always have local options and tasty seasonals. The hot dogs fill me up, but if you want a side the onion rings are thin and crispy, much easier to eat than traditional thick ones in my opinion. Also, the rocket sauce is BANGIN', but enjoy with caution because the spiciness does sneak up on you after a few bites."}
{"text":"For a hot dog place.... I give this place 5 stars.  I love that they burn the hot dog, just how I like.   And I love their orangeade.   The music selection is always good and their serve beer and wine.   What's not to love here."}
{"text":"I ventured into JJ's on a whim that I believe was influenced by hearing the name mentioned frequently on Yelp.  Maybe I am confusing the name with the significant other of our former CLT Yelp CM.  Nonetheless, I heard of it.  We wanted a quick place to go for lunch.  This is where we ended up.  Atmosphere - Casual, warm, clean, hipster-ish-y for a modern location, inviting, an intimate space while still feeling easy to maneuver about   Service - friendly, trained on the product, communicative  Food - Being overwhelmed with choices (I know...it's odd...isn't this just a hotdog joint?) I opted for the Hand Crafted (build your own) option that allows for 3 toppings.  I got a hotdog on a toasted bun with slaw, JJ's Hot Relish, and...yellow mustard.  I think my lack of sleep the night before guided me to the choices I made that in all actuality were just plain odd.  I believe my mind was focused on the slaw that I saw on another patrons order and the rest fell into the \"I like hot stuff and yellow mustard separately...why not together?\" thought process.  I knew this was an odd order to place based on the puzzled look from the person at the counter.  I also opted for some fries, onion rings, and un-sweet tea.    Everything arrived to the table piping hot!  The hotdog was good, but probably would have been better sans slaw or just slaw.  I appreciated the grilled appearance and taste of the hotdog and the bun was soft but still substantial.  The fries, while commercial in appearance, were awesome!  They were cooked perfectly crisp and tasted clean as if they were made with fresh oil.  While the fries were cut to the perfect size for me, the onion rings were not.  These onion rings were the shoestring fries of the onion ring world and unfortunately, I am not a fan of shoestring fries.  In my opinion there is too much of a greasy taste.  The tea was as good as un-sweetened can be.   Overall - If you want a quick and inexpensive bite to eat with a great atmosphere and solid food, I do not think you can go wrong with JJ's Red Hots."}
{"text":"A perfect lunch for yourself, with friends or with business clients.  Food Portions good size.  Pickle bar is outstanding.  Killer bar area with big view of windows and TV's for the sports minded crew.  Recommend trying the Cheesey Dog this week.  The WORLD's BEST home made pimento chez around!!!  A perfect menu with specials - value with great tasting food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really good hot dogs. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I have anticipated this place opening for some time as we need a good quality, inexpensive restaurant in Ballantyne.  I stopped in for lunch and all I ordered was the \"whistle pig\" hot dog.  It was really well cooked with a charred but not burned exterior and was served hot.  The roll was of good quality as well.  I saw several of the platters going out to the customers that were dining in and the onion rings looked amazing.  I would have ordered some if I was not just having a light lunch during my break from work.  I am curious to see the atmosphere during football season at the bar as they only have 2 tv's.  I will certainly be bringing the family back to try the full side order menu."}
{"text":"Ordered my linner (lunch-dinner) here on Tuesday for the $2 Tuesday special.   Since I'm a vegetarian, I ordered the Vejjie sandwich, which is basically grilled portobello mushrooms and onions in a balsamic vinaigrette and other sauce spread on a potato roll, it was pretty good.. A little too heavy on the balsamic vinaigrette, but it wouldn't stop me from ordering it again. I got the combo and could have got fries, chips, coleslaw or barracho beans. I went with the beans- pinto beans, onions, peppers, beer and melted cheese. They were very tasty. It also came with a drink- any soda, lemonade, orangeade, un/sweet tea. I got the sweet tea which was pretty good too. The combo was $7.99 and very filling.  Next time, I'm going to try a milkshake, orangeade, salad, and some of the other choices. Can't wait!!!  Good job, JJ Red Hots in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"Several dog varieties based on toppings or you can make your own. The dogs are excellent , grilled and somewhat charred- very tasty. Generous amounts of toppings are created with a regional flare, like Coney Island and Chicago.   Onion rings are vey good."}
{"text":"So good! They have a vast selection and lots of toppings. Their combo prices are very reasonable...I was starvinggggg and almost got two hot dogs but one was more than enough. For $7.99 I got a hot dogs, tater tots and a drink, I got the \"quarter hounded\" which had bacon, queso, lettuce and tomatoes & their special sauce...which was amazing. I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"This is amazing we have a hot dog place in charlotte that's this good. Like if I could rate 6 star I would. Try the bratwurst!!"}
{"text":"The location is quite large for a hot dog establishment and there is a bar in the restaurant. The hotdog selection is vast and I feel the pickle bar is a nice added feature.   Being from Chicago I had to refuse to try the Chicago style. My questions about the chi town dog ended when I found out it wasn't served on a poppy seed bun. Whats next?...not Vianna Beef.  I ended up boycotting all the red hots and having a turkey sausage which was \"ok.\"Overall, im a firm believer that hot dogs were meant to be served from:   1. Stands  2. Hole in the wall grease joints   -or-  3. Portillos  The whole Americas' dog deal just isn't my thing. Dogs are ultra local and should be kept that way. Call me a purest but Com'on man!"}
{"text":"'The hot dogs are good. Just got mustard & onions on one and chilly & slaw on the other. The toppings were slim. But it was delicious!!  The fries they offer are crinkle cut & skinny. They are not good. If they would serve  thicker fries it would be much better."}
{"text":"JJ red Hots bumps hard! My husband and I went to a lunch date and I got a sausage and one of their fancy hot dogs. Anytime Im i the mood for not the regular I come here. There is always a different kind of dog through the week."}
{"text":"I agree food is just ok.  The menu items look delicious on the board but what you get is entirely different. I got the Southern Girl with chili fries.  Crinkle cut fries fried too hard and the chili - not fresh it just sat on the fries seem as though it was straight from a can. I had to come home and add some shredded cheese on top to make it edible.  Needs improvement.  The hotdog was ok."}
{"text":"I had the bratwurst & Whistle Pig hot dog both were delish. The toppings on each were perfect but the lemonade wasn't that great, a bit sour."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. The tater tots here are amazing, got a hint of spiced up hotness to them.  Great positive for me, they got cherry Coke and cheerwine as well. Not to mention a bar with some tap beers. Not bad guys, good spot. Hangover? Come grab a bite"}
{"text":"Charlotte - I had the Coney Chili and Cheese Dog with onions here and it was great. Had that lil Smoked taste to it and it was one of the best hot dogs that I ever had and I will be returning"}
{"text":"I don't know why it's taken me so long to write this review, because I absolutely LOVE this place!  The ONE negative experience, and the loss of the 1 star, is because around the 2nd time I visited, I ordered the Chips and right after I paid, I watched my cashier go to the pan with the Chips and scoop my chips up with his bare hands. What the what!!! No gloves, no tongs, nothing. The only thing I could say was in that moment was, DID YOU JUST DO THAT IN FRONT OF ME!?!?!?! He looked at me thoroughly confused and said \"what do you mean\". I asked for more chips that were not touched by him and explained that I didn't appreciate him picking my food up with his hands. He was still confused and said that's how he grabs them. In that moment someone else walked up, took my chips, used gloves and gave me new chips.  I haven't seen that guy since & now I look extra close as they make my food and they always use either tongs or gloves.I almost didn't return, I thought that if this was how they did things I surely can't go back, but it's so good, I had to give them another chance.  And i'm glad I did!! My go to hot dog is the Char Hill. Everything good about North Carolina is in this hot dog. Thick & juicy grilled hot dog, chilli, slaw, onions & mustard. The only thing missing for me is the ketchup which I add on the side. Their hot dogs are so good I can eat them with no bread. I sometimes also get the Italian Sausage which is Italian Sausage, Mustard & Peppers. But as I type this review, I am sitting here thinking it would probably be good if I added white slaw on it as well. Yuuuummmmm!! For sides i've tried the Chips & Tator Tots which are both good. They also sell King Of Pops popsicles. Which for some reason are kind of melted and broken in their freezer. Doesn't make me want one, though I love King Of Pops. I think i'm going to JJ's today, this review has me fiending!! I love that their bread is also thick and soft. Not thin, mushy bread from a watery hot dog being thrown in it. They have it all figured out!! Go to JJ's!!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought of a hot dog joint in the heart of Ballantyne.  Why the folks at JJ's, of course.  Now I can eat at JJ's original location when I am home and at this location when I'm at work.    This location is slightly bigger than the original location on East Blvd and has a bar.  The decor is similar with a drumset light fixture and the license plates on a wall near the ceiling.   The menu is right before your order so you can make your decision first and then place your order.  Select a dog or sausage or two or order the combo which comes with your choice of side and a fountain drink.  You'll receive a number and then they will bring out your order.  The dogs are amazing here.  The sausage is good also but I prefer the smokiness of the dogs and the various toppings.  They have various selections for your to choose from or you can choose to make your own toppings combination.  And finish it off at the pickle bar with pickled onions and other veggies.  Good Stuff JJ's, as always!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicago style dog and the Quarter Hounder with house chips.  The queso on the Quarter Hounder was great, and the Chicago dog was filled with toppings.  Both great selections and would eat again."}
