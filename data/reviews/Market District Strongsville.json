{"text":"We really enjoyed the delicious pizza we ordered from the Cafe - ($8 special for Large 2 topping between 4 and 8p) and the Friday night Flights/Bites.  Good music. Nice atmosphere. Seems to be lots of \"regulars\""}
{"text":"Awesome staff and incredible selection. Love the ladies in the Eagles Nest too! Our kids love to go there while we shop! The Curbside Pick Up has been life changing! Love Curbside service and the staff!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice grocery store. Has a restaurant, bar, bakery, gelato stand, salad bar, amazing meat selection, expanded cheese section, expanded organic, housewares, bulk foods, huge beer & wine selection, and lots more.  Services include dry cleaning, curbside express, pharmacy, & more.  The food at the restaurant is excellent.   I have tried the sandwiches, burgers, & house made chips & everything was delicious.  Curbside express allows you to shop online & pickup at the back of the store.  They do the shopping for you!  Love all the local grocery products at this store & the large selection of seasonal items.  So much nicer than your typical Giant Eagle store."}
{"text":"GE wants to try hard to take on Whole Foods who will soon be adding another outlet in Rocky River.   I grocery shop there for high end and specific items but do the discount run more often.  The added feature at this location is the bar and dining feature.   Not sure they have nailed it yet.  Selections tonight included the herb roasted salmon with jasmine rice and fresh veggies.  Bland all the way through though veggies were sauted properly.  Also found a pin bone in the filet.  Portion was bit small.  Fish tacos were also on skimpy side....need more fish and some kind of better slaw mix.  Managers were receptive to feedback and made the experience right.   But also can't help feeling a less than  enthusiastic attitude from staff.  Not exactly off putting but not as welcoming as I know this company requires.  More smiles and warmth needed.  Bartender was also a bit unsure of products.  Need  more information on descriptions.  Bar was not yet full and imagined that it would be impossible to get proper service once every thing cranked up.  Work in progress...more training."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I live out of town and love wandering around. Awesome wine/beer. Fresh foods, cheese, bakery, all are awesome! Great to just wander and pick up unique stuff.... PS did I mention sweets?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. I stood at the butcher counter for a good 15 minutes before eventually walking off. The guy behind the counter ignored me and took orders of several others."}
{"text":"i love shopping here! their wide variety of food makes cooking much more entertaining."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! On top of being a supermarket that sells premium groceries, there's a bar, a Starbucks, and a caf√© inside! The food is actually pretty good for what it is! My friend and I ordered a salmon burger and fish tacos. By no means should the quality be compared with that of gourmet restaurants, but for a casual eatery/setting, it's pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Oscar Blues Tenfidy is $14 at Market District and $10 at Acme. I get that this is supposed to be an \"upscale\" store and selection isn't bad here, but a lot supermarkets have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"We go to dinner at the cafe quite a lot.  Burgers are in my top 2 in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! When you walk in you have the choice of sitting at an awesome bar or grabbing a drink while you shop. There is also a Starbucks inside and a kitchen so you can sit an eat as well. The store is always very clean and the employees are always helpful and kind. Definitely a great addition to Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch as well as grocery shopping.  I'll review both experiences...  LUNCH More variety than most lunch places (sushi, taco's, burgers, salad bar, pizza, Starbucks, etc.).  So if you're with indecisive co-workers, it might be a good choice.  Prices are a little high IMO.  The dining room atmosphere and food presentation is better than the food itself, which is just average.  SHOPPING Basically your standard Giant Eagle, but about 50% bigger and with 50% more selection.  They have more high-end displays than your average Giant Eagle, but overall it's the same brands and everything.  So just like the cafe... it's the presentation and atmosphere that makes it unique, not the food."}
{"text":"Is this concept working?  Does anyone go here for the bar?  While it seems cool to have a bar in the grocery store, I've never really seen anyone patronizing it.  The grocery store itself was fine.  On par with every other Giant Eagle, with a few more offerings that I mostly don't care about (gelato, bulk seasonings, dry aged- beef).  I ordered some breakfast tacos in the restaurant area.  Service was pretty bad.  I stood at the empty counter for about 10 minutes (thinking they were closed) waiting for my husband to check out with the groceries before someone came up and said \"Do you want to order something or not?\"  The $8 I paid for 2 tacos and hash browns was too much, and it took literally 15 minutes for them to prepare (there is a timer on the screen that you can see), which seems like a lot for foods that must have been already cooked and just reheated.  I would treat this like any other Giant Eagle.  Everything else seems like a waste of space to me."}
{"text":"4 samples of any of their draft beers for $5?! Yes, please! What a steal deal! They have a great draft list here and during happy hour beers are only $2 and they do not accept tips.   Everyone should check out their 4 food and drink samples for $5 friday events- they are cheap, fun and they usually have a local band for entertainment."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only. So they build this monstrosity on Pearl Rd. so they could build this trendy restaurant/bar. I finally get time to try the food here thinking that it will be really good. WTF?!?!? I paid over 20 bucks for a quasi-Chuck-E-Cheese quality pizza and a burger that I would classify as a Poor excuse for a Bob's Big Boy clone. How can they fix their face to call this average cafeteria food gourmet? I am SO disappointed. I will say the service was excellent and timely. The kitchen seemed very clean. Their issue is the quality of their food. They will not be able sustain this cafe if they don't address this issue. Well I guess they can expand the bar when the restaurant fails."}
{"text":"I decided to go and check out the store on their soft grand opening in October 2014 and decided to order a burger for dinner to go. Well made a wrong mistake the Meal i ordered i got my lettect but no salad dressing, oh and by the way if your eating while reading it stop eating. so anyway i ordered fries that never made it into the meal so i got home and soon to realize the burger tasted funny after already calling the store to notify them what happen that my fries and salad dressing never made it Even though i paid for it.      But My burger was raw inside and not cooked. so I contacted the store again told them and never went back after that because of raw food was not cooked well enough. If something not right speak up and say something no matter how often you have to call and report something on your order they will listen but also make sure you are in contact with the Department manager so they are aware of it.      If you do get sick from raw food just notify the health department and have everything together that they will need."}
{"text":"Quick review that may or may not be updated:  - As with all new stuff in the burbs, crowded with everyone looking at the shiny new store. Guess I'm guilty too as I went against my better judgement   - Pretty much the same as the other GEs with a bit more artisan products.  - The bar had a good selection of beer at great prices, but the food served there was average... maybe.  I will go back, but will wait for the novelty to wane."}
{"text":"I always gave Market District the benefit of the doubt and actually frequented the place lately but after tonight never again. I went to the fish counter to get some Chilean Sea bass this afternoon...about $35 worth...and walked away with a horrible experience. Fast forward to 8pm, we just put the baby down and we're expecting to cook a nice meal. I fired up my trusty Weber kettle and came in the get the fish out to season it. Upon opening it I noticed an offensive smell and proceeded to grab a piece out of the bag only to find it was slimy and left a white film on my hand. Needless to say, my wife took it back sans receipt and returned it for a refund. She said everyone was nice and they handled it in a timely fashion. This still doesn't change the fact that the night was ruined. With the condition that fish was in it should never have been sold. The person working the fish counter should've recognized this but instead she told me what a great choice I made and how it was going to make an excellent meal. WRONG. All it did was ruin our dinner. Not to mention the charcoal I wasted and the dill I bought especially for this recipe went in the trash. I usually give places a second chance but this was inexcusable. Never again GE Market District...never again."}
{"text":"We are not complainers. That being said, we ate at the Market District restaurant. Burger was not good (so not good) and salad was abysmal (wilted and only filled half the bowl and this was a dinner sized salad). Staff was kind. But this is a no go. $10 small burger with a tiny fruit dish. GET THE SALAD BAR if you want a salad."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite grocery stores in the area. They have everything in stock, a restaurant and bar, eagles nest, dry cleaner, you name it. 50/50 experience with the employees friendliness. There are worst grocery stores."}
{"text":"Ok, forget everything you know about grocery shopping. This isn't just shopping, it's an experience.  I come here often to pick up some food from the prepared foods bar. I travel for work constantly, which explains why I eat out so much when I'm in town. I love restaurants but sometimes I just want to grab a chickpea and feta salad and sit on my couch in my undies while watching Game of Thrones. As great as restaurants are, they tend to have minimum pant requirements.  The prepared foods bar has everything from crabcakes to quinoa salad. I can grab something fast that isn't fast food and be on my way.  On my most recent visit, a band was playing in the bar area of the store. Did I mention the bar? Strange concept, but the bar is usually close to full in the evenings. Not sure who the target demographic is supposed to be since I can't imagine deciding to go to the bar that is located inside a grocery store, but hey, seems to be working out ok on the nights I am there. Might even be a marketing genius out there who thought that a person probably buys more after a drink or two. Someone told me that you can order a drink and take it with you to drink as you shop. But I have never seen anyone actually do this, so I have no idea if that's true or not. So don't blame me if security makes you put down your IPA while you pick out your almond nut butter.  I have only eaten at the restaurant once. It was brunch and I had an egg burrito thing. It was actually pretty tasty, but expensive. I would eat there again, but only out of convenience. But the layout of the restaurant is cute and modern looking and it's easy to forget you are in a store.  I actually enjoy just browsing the aisles looking at the products. The person who does the marketing and merchandising better be paid handsomely because I never leave with just the items I came in to buy. I get suckered into to buying stuff I had no idea I even wanted.   And the wine/beer selection...Oh. My. Lawd. I should just have my payroll direct deposit go straight to Market District. So many beers, so little time."}
{"text":"The Friday night Flights 'N Bites are the best. Usually just $5 -$7 for the glass, three tastings and food to pair with the wine or beer.  Live music!! Sometimes an older crowd, but if you need more food, they have a great menu and wood burning oven for pizza."}
{"text":"This is the coolest grocery store I have ever seen. Wider selection of food than most other grocery stores. Not to mention, the beer/wine selection is incredible. You can probably find any beer you want at this place.   There is also a starbucks, a bar, a cafe, and plenty of lounging area with couches and TVs. The cafe has great burgers. And the breakfast omelet was very good as well. When I was there for dinner, there was a live band playing music and they were phenomenal. The atmosphere was very fun. It definitely exceeded all of my expectations."}
{"text":"I will never again buy any prepared foods from the restaurant area in my life after being there today and watching their food service prep crew!!! Food sits out for extended periods of time getting cold and their servers wear the same set of plastic gloves while they touch counters, screens sinks and peoples food!!! Absolutely revolting... Then they give you 2 sandwiches that have been sitting out for 15 minutes and expect you to be grateful!!!  Got home and threw my cold food out.  You have list a customer for life..."}
{"text":"I've noticed that a lot of things from opening day have been undone.   There used to be a huge island of organic/vegetarian stuff right across from the organic/vegetarian fridges. There was a sign floating above this island celebrating this very thing. Somewhere around Thanksgiving it had been cleared out and replaced with \"Gobble! Gobble!\" and turkeys. Since then, I believe it is now the home of \"Pies! Pies! Pies!\" The fridges still have stuff at least, so that's nice. I'm not a vegetarian, though my girlfriend is, but I have to say those veggie burgers there are the best! They're really good and we can't find them anywhere else except here.  The ready-to-go meals have reverted to mostly the same menu as the GE counterparts. I've picked some up occasionally and every time they've been under-seasoned and tasted bland. I'm not sure about the pick-your-own-veggies-fruits candy bins, but whenever I walk by now, they're just empty. I'm not sure if they're actually getting use or if they just never refilled them.  I feel like my rant about coconut water was received and countered with an enormous end-of-an-aisle promo display of TONS of Harvest Bay. Funny.  Beer and wine selection's pretty good. It has room to improve some still - mainly referring to the beer selection. There's definitely the space for it.  Such a nitpick, but, every time I leave from there, the first set of automatic doors still has the exact same rectangular metal trim missing that I can't help but stare at as I exit. Such a small detail, but it's like the grocery store equivalent of a zit.  Something I forgot in my last review that is totally awesome. If you don't like carrying around all your reward cards and have put the time into entering them into your smart phone, the self-checkout scanners can actually scan the phone's barcodes! This is great since almost everywhere else you have to manually enter in the numbers. I hope the card readers get NFC-capabilities (Apple Pay/Android Pay) added next. Right now, that's just limited to Whole Foods and West Point Market in Akron.  I'm also pretty impressed with their stock of men's bath amenities. I don't think I've ever noticed shaving brushes in any grocery store."}
{"text":"Dude, this grocery store is AMAZEBALLS! I have never ever been to such a BEAUTIFUL grocery store in all my days. I could go on and on all day about this place.....but I won't. Plus, you should just come and see this place for yourself. But a few things to note:  1) Parking is a'plenty here! Not short on spots that is for sure. Plus, this is easy to get into and out of on the main road. Which makes it even more enjoyable.  2) If you are a beer and wine lover. THIS. IS. THE. STORE. FOR. YOU. I have never seen a larger wine and beer selection in a grocery store. Not to mention, they have an actual bar you can sit at and drink. Getting drunk before you shop? Totally possible here folks.   3) Their cafe here is so cool. Not only can you get MTO food (made to order) you can also get prepared hot foods AND shop out of the cold case. They have a microwave area that you can warm the food up. Their seating area here is GINORMOUS. And the booths are the most comfortable booths I have ever sat in. I honestly wanted to sit here ALL DAY!   4) Free WIFI? They have you covered here too.  That is all I have for this store....there is so much more, but I tell ya, you have to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Was in the area and needed to run to the grocery store, so I decided to check out the new(ish) Market District. And dang, I really wish there was a directory like there is at the mall when you first walk in because this girl had not a clue where to start. WOW, this place is large and in charge might I say. Literally thought to myself \"Wow, I'm not in Kansas anymore\". It has such a different presentation than the other grocery stores in the area. Definitely seemed like they are trying to make grocery shopping glitzy and glamorous which kind of makes me laugh a little.  I literally ran in to get ice cream, and celery, and chicken broth, so I can't really review all the departments. The store is really really large like I said before. I didn't have enough time to check out the starbucks, and the wine & beer selection, or look at the bar and cafe section. But all the parts that I did see, I was pretty impressed with.   I think it's really interesting that they have a Gelato station. I'm a HUGE gelato fan, and wonder how much success they are having with it. Gelato, is usually pretty expensive, but I found the prices to be a little steep for a grocery store gelato place. When I stopped and oggled at all the somewhat good looking gelato, there didn't appear to be anybody working the counter, and I didn't have time to wait for somebody to appear, so on I went.  Their ice cream aisle is really great. And I can't tell you how awesome it was to see all the different brands they have. They had a nice little feature of Jeni's and Graeters and a few other brand's. Honestly I came to try and find Ben and Jerry's new core flavors, and they have 4 of them. So I was able to walk out of the store a pretty happy girl.  Definitely planning on coming back in the near future to go grocery shopping when I have more time, and comfier shoes."}
{"text":"Great place to shop and chill. We like eating here then shopping since you shouldn't shop hungry, kids meals are really good and we can try a different wine or beer each time."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed my brief shopping experience here. It reminded me of a Whole Foods.  We went here to pick up some cakes from the bakery. For the end of the day on a Friday, I was impressed that they still had plenty of options.  We got a cheesecake that was topped with fruit as well as a sponge cake.  Prices were reasonable and everyone enjoyed both items.  In general, I don't shop at Giant Eagle because the prices are higher so I doubt I will ever do my regular grocery shopping here. But for a last minute dessert run, I would go back.  I didn't have time to explore the rest of the store so it's a good idea to read the other reviews as well."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Even though it is a grocery store, it doesn't feel like it at all when you are sitting down in the bar area enjoying a delicious meal. Sometimes there is even some live music which is always a plus. Would definitely recommend people to dine in!"}
{"text":"You seriously need to put on some walking shoes (or in my case, lower heels) to be walk in this Giant Eagle. Goodness!  Picked up the Sea Bass & Filet Mignon. Both were VERY fresh! In fact, the woman in the seafood department was just cutting it up as I was walking up.   I also decided to pick up a cupcake &  some french macarons for dessert. Surprisingly, the cupcake that I got (cookies & cream) was moist & the icing wasn't too sweet. I normally have the worst luck with grocery bakery cupcakes but, this one was really good! The french macaroons were...meh. They were larger in size than a regular macaron. I got the chocolate, caramel, & pistachio. The chocolate one was too sweet & tasted like a brownie. The caramel was just okay but, I kind of liked the pistachio so,  I'll have to try that again.  Overall, I'm really impressed with this upscale giant eagle & will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the family here today.   Food was good. The seasonal French Toast was yummy.   They do have a kids menu  Coffee was fair.   There is a bar and a Starbucks in this store!  Update: We really like it here. Lots of options and they have different specials each night. The pizza is good. I made salad from the salad bar today and hubby ordered a burger. The fries are delicious too!!"}
{"text":"This store is impressive, with so many choices of foods to buy and services to check out. Will definitely shop here again. My one issue is that I tried the grilled cheeseburger and it was AWFUL....very greasy, undercooked and way over-priced at close to $11.00 without a beverage. People in restaurant taking my order were helpful but so busy and restaurant seemed understaffed...had to go and get my food myself, after waiting 20 min for it to be brought to me as instructed. So, will not get grilled items there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Market District is one of my favorite grocery stores in the area. It is partially because you can drink beer and wine wine while grocery shopping. My boyfriend and I have visited the Market District restaurant several times and we've never been disappointed. In all honesty the restaurant is a lot better than the local chain restaurants in the area. The groceries are a little pricy but they are high quality and worth a few extra dollars. Check out Market District for a quick bite to eat, brew, and/or grocery shopping."}
{"text":"So rude! Last Monday afternoon, I came in hoping to buy a whole filet (aka filet mignon but in one piece still) and the man at the counter was incredibly rude. He informed me the \"meat cutter\" was gone for the day and said that what I was asking for was unavailable. He offered no alternatives and when I tried to explain the recipe I was following he made a sexist comment \"well you'd have to get your husband to cut it\"... my mouth fell open. Seriously?! Did he really think I was incapable of cutting into a steak? Unreal. It made me NEVER want to visit this location again. I will be buying my filet mignon and all other specialty meats at Heinens or really anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is a grocery store that happens to have a bar/restaurant. All serve their intended purposes. They have a large number of items you won't find at a regular GE.  1. Are you able to purchase groceries at the establishment? Yes. 2. Are you able to purchase and drink alcoholic beverages from the bar? Yes. 3. Are you able to purchase food from the in house \"restaurant?\" Yes.  Prices: I don't fret over saving $0.50 on something. If this is an issue to you, that's your problem.  Service: Customer service is acceptable. This is a busy establishment. Be patient and wait your turn for help, like an adult.   Seriously though, read point(s) one through three. If you have a problem with a grocery store having a bar/restaurant...bypass it by not being a patron to those two features. It's that simple."}
{"text":"Love the people and service here!  Every employee I interact with does their best to be helpful.  The new selections are impressive.  The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the prices.  Some things are very overpriced compared to the prior location.  The store and parking lot are clean and the willing of employees to help load groceries is helpful."}
{"text":"This place made me feel like I was back in a Chicago Whole Foods without the pretentiousness. Couldn't help but order a drink at the bar and the staff member told me all about the events that they have and appeased me with my questions about how business was going. Prices were surprisingly normal and I was waaaaay happier than usual shopping with a glass of wine in tow. 1000x would come out of my way to shop here."}
{"text":"Since my first visit I have stopped in for lunch 2 additional times.    Service was better and all 3 dishes I have tried were of good quality.    I have tried Turkey Club, Pizza, and the Market District Burger which was also good.  My take on the prices, ehh probably $1 too expensive.  So not outrageous but if they were to shave $1 across the board the prices would be a good fit in my opinion."}
{"text":"Happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6pm bottled beers are 2 for $4 or a dollar off draft beers which are not typically more than $5 to begin with. Do you need another reason to return? Flights and bites should seal the deal then. Every Friday from 6-9pm. For $5.40 you get three pairings of beer or wine and food. They rotate each week, one week beer, the next wine. During the beer night, you keep the glass, which typically is all the incentive I need since the glasses are usually sweet!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food there, super fresh and great quality. Hands down the best soda mix I have ever had (the coke mix is on point).  Reasonably priced and quite honestly the food is the only saving grace of visiting this Giant Eagle. The people there are so unbelievably pretentious and absolutely miserable to be around, honestly the largest collection of snobs and \"I demand to see a manager\" you will find just south of the West Side Market.  Excellent aged beef in the back, super nice staff in the butcher shop and bakery, the staff at GE is fantastic, its just really difficult to stomach the Chads and Paiges that shop there."}
{"text":"Best grocery store in OH.   Restaurant - Starbucks - cooking classes / Demos - sushi chef & great selection of organic + health food (similar to whole foods)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. For number 1. I love being able to drop my kid off at the eagles nest and let her do a craft while I rome around this store. And if she is not with me it is nice to have a beer and browse around. It has a great little bar that you can get a beer and enjoy a piece of pizza while watching a game, which I have done that numerous times.. The meat dept is AMAZING, I have to thank all the butchers there. I am not sure what the one guys name is but he has guages in his ears. WISE BEFORE HIS YEARS. Butcher shop to me have been loosing stamina in this economy but the mafkey district has brought it back with this crew. I LOVE the aging section.. The only complaint I have is the check out. Sometimes there is somebody there to tell you what checkout to go to and other times theres not. I am sure it has to do with the volume of people in the store, but sometimes people just wait dumb founded and then when you go to a register they say they were there first. Slight miniscual thing but I have come across some real cranky people. Other then that a great store and they will always have my business."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Market District Cafe, a beer and wine pub inside a grocery store -- what a concept!  The Cafe has a varied selection of craft beers on tap. If you're shopping you can get a beer to accompany you on your rounds. There are some wines, but I haven't paid attention to them. There's a good selection of bar food: Burgers, sandwiches, wings, salads, apps.   I ordered wings with garlic/ginger glaze. Tasty, but essentially all the kitchen did was toss the fried wings with what seemed to be bottled Thai sweet chili sauce. Seems lazy to me, so I'm dinging the Cafe a star."}
