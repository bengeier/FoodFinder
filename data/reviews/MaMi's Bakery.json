{"text":"Just dropped by this adorable little bakery that just opened in Aurora.  The desserts look amazing!  I was out walking so didn't indulge but will definitely be coming back to pick up one of those pineapple cakes.  The owners were a nice friendly couple who told me they make everything themselves and they just opened a week ago.  Enjoyed the ice coffee and looking forward to trying some of those desserts!"}
{"text":"Came by this cupcake store to grab a cupcake for my moms birthday. They are very pretty and many are super shiny! Very well worth the price! About $4.50 per cupcake they're super camera worthy! The taste is okay, not bad. I find it very creamy. However the packaging is great too! Cute little bakery! You can find parking on the side or a parking lot right by!"}
{"text":"Tried a few of their pastries and loved it! We also placed a special order of  a few dozen chocolate covered strawberries for an event. All of our guests loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bakery in town , and relaxing spot to enjoy cappuccino and delicious pastry. Place is so cozy and welcoming , and every desert we have tried was amazing. They have gluten free options and you can order birthday cake at very reasonable price (our favorite Raspberry merengue)."}
