{"text":"Awesome food.Great staff ! Glad to see a place that's going to make it in this spot! Definitely try the margaritas ... Ariba Ariba"}
{"text":"This place is legit. The tacos Mexicanos hit the spot. Margaritas are killer too. The wait staff are friendly as well."}
{"text":"My quest for a good, authentic Mexican restaurant in Lake Norman continues.  I would place this one a bit above the others I have tried (I excuse the excellent Verde from this list, and would call it Mexican-inspired fine dining).  The flavors have more depth, more nuance, than typical suburban Mexican restaurants.  The menu is extensive, perhaps too much so.  But the steak in my Burrito Verde was overcooked, dry, and tough.  The margarita did taste like it was from a mix.  The service was good.  This location has proven itself challenging, and, sadly, I would not bet on El Toro's success."}
{"text":"Any Mexican restaurant with 5 Mexican beers on tap, is ok by me. We didn't eat there, but the salsa and chips were authentic and delicious. I'll definitely be going back to dine."}
{"text":"El toro is the most authentic Mexican place in the Cornelius/Huntersville area. We really enjoyed the bar area , it was very nice compared to all other Mexican  places in the area. The dining area is also very nice and very inviting . This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"LOVE El Toros food. I will sometimes say to my family- lets go somewhere different, lets go to el toro!!! My family all love el toro also. I would absolutely recommend el toro!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for my first time ever today and ordered from the lunch specials ($4.99) menu.  Food was excellent and service superb.  All staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Food had a nice fresh and light taste.  Just simple good Mexican.  Restaurant was clean and has a great layout. Could not have had a better experience and will definitely make this a regular place for dining out!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite. We go at least twice a month. Very delicious food, great atmosphere, and awesome staff. chicken chimi is my go to. But everything is yummy. Recently tried the fish taco platter. Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We've been looking for a Mexican restaurant since we moved here.  Finally found one that we love.  Best chicken soup and guacamole."}
{"text":"Very so-so Mexican food and service. Bland tasting fajitas. Forgot my tortillas until I prompted them. My #1 Mexican spot remains to be Taxco in Huntersville at Northcross Shopping. Have been going there for about 13 years now and it is always the family's \"go to\" restaurant if we aren't itching for another, specific type of food on any given night. I need to rate them stars on their own page for both food quality and lightning fast service. Most Mexican restaurants I've been to are either 3 or 4 star in my opinion. So that provides further context for my 2 stars at this place. Doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I have had in a long time, excellent staff and service. The Camarones AL Diabla were amazing (spicy). I will be back again. You can tell the food was made with love."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience, bad sevices or a bad meal here. We took our son there for his 15 birthday and the 3 waiters were slammed. Standing room only with people coming in like crazy, but they still took the time to sing happy birthday to him. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner a couple months ago and it was good enough that we thought we'd come back and try it for lunch.  BIG mistake!!!!!  Their lunch menu is very limited and when I asked the waiter if I could order something off the regular menu, I was told NO.  The lunch I had didn't even come with rice or beans....what kind of a Mexican restaurant is this???  I got a taco and an enchilada thrown on a plate with nothing else.  The appearance of the food was not appetizing and the taste wasn't much better.  If you're going to come here, make sure it's at dinner time when you have much more to choose from.  The lack of customers at lunchtime explains it all, plus the servers are less than friendly and accommodating.   IMO, Casa Garcia in Denver is a MUCH better choice than this place for lunch and dinner.  We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is huge with a decent bar and patio area! The tacos are great and they have several different kinds. The chili rellenos were good too! So far my favorite Mexican food place in the area. 
Oh! Beware on May 5th this place gets crazy. I mean no parking available at all crazy."}
{"text":"Got dang amazing Mexican food. .well slightly americanized but who cares. The portions are wonderful and match the price you would expect to pay.  Unlimited chips and salsa at no charge which our daughter loves and the food tastes great and hasn't been over cooked one time we've been here (around a dozen since opening). Got a side of grilled chicken togo and got three times what we expected.  Very friendly staff.  Will be back at least once a month."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant you should absolutely try!  Authentic Mexican cuisine at a more than reasonable price.  The staff is friendly and extremely hard working.  This place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here and everyone loved the food. The service was good and the price is great. I highly recommend it for regular lunch, dinner or private events. You must try the chicken soup and spinach enchiladas."}
{"text":"Food, service, and price all get 5 . The only downfalls I found would be the horrible acoustics that made it very hard to hear and the air conditioning that seemed to be set high so it felt like it was 80 degrees inside.it was about 86 outside, so it was still better than that. Next time we will pick a cooler night and enjoy the GREAT food on the much quieter outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Always fresh, great servers and the Margarita are fantastic.  Don't pass on the Queso Dip with Chorizo."}
{"text":"We came here a while back with some friends it was our first time coming here and it won't be our last it was very good fast friendly service you could tell they actually want to do a good job. they are great for a family outings  and their queso  and guacamole was very good! I got the chicken enchiladas and I would order it again!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in the area in a while.  Great Food and Service.  The restaurant and bar area is very nice.  They should have a salsa night on the weekends.   Love this place.  Highly recommend it, check it out!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today after finding on yelp. Server was nice & food came fast and hot. I'm a big mexican food fan but the food was pretty good but nothing special.  I got the lunch chimichanga...not very filled with chicken but since I'm not a big eater no big deal. I would come back but I wouldn't run back as again its average this go round. Maybe different next time."}
{"text":"We were promptly seated at lunch time; there were many tables available. Complimentary salsa and chips were immediately delivered. Once our order was placed, it arrived quickly. Their lunch specials are well priced and generous in portion. The fajitas were amazing as was the pollo al queso. We will definitely return to give their dinner and margs a try, although those prices do seem a little higher than expected in comparison to other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Fast food and great atmosphere, family friendly. Busy place on the weekends but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is delish!~  It was hot, tasty and quickly served.  We went in at a very slow time when service can sometimes be bad in restaurants but that was not the case here.  Very good service, reasonable prices and delicious food."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to come and relax after work with friends... The queso dip was really good. Their food was not expensive!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic tamales you will ever eat ...
Great food, excellent service and the staff makes you feel like part of the family ! 
Best Mexican restaurant , so fortunate to have it here in the Lake Norman area !"}
{"text":"Get the Guacamole it's the bomb. The place is a nice design first time being in here. Nice people very friendly"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, but 2 out of the 3 of us got very sick within a few hours of eating here. We both had chicken dishes and water...the one who didn't get sick had beef and tea. Not sure if it was due to the food or poor sanitation, but I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"THE BEST margaritas anywhere! I always get the Cadillac, but I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong.
Excellent service time and time again.
Food is yummy. Bueno Queso."}
{"text":"Got the chicken fajitas for take out. When I picked up the food, the restaurant seemed very up to date and clean. Food was delicious and on point! Can't wait to go back and eat in at the bar(which has 4 big screens!)"}
{"text":"Slow service. They recommended the steak and cheese burrito...  Pretty bad. 

Drinks weren't the best.

Fajitas were good. 

Go to la unica"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant, they have all the regular Mexican foods on the menu. I would recommend"}
{"text":"Wow.  Good Mexican food. Great servers and a full bar.  A++. They have a chicken dish for lunch or dinner that has chorizo and grilled chicken together tossed in queso.  I can't remember the name of it but it's on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was SLOW, waited 20 minutes before they ever asked us what we wanted to drink or bring water.  Food was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Don't order takeout from here if you want to eat what you ordered. Third time we've ordered takeout and it's been the complete OPPOSITE of what we ordered... like when we tell them what we don't want on the food they put it on the food. Got ignored by one of the waiters when walking in to pick up food and said \"I'm picking up\".. he greeted people behind me and brought them to a table like I was invisible and I stood there until someone finally asked me if I needed help. My boyfriend is allergic to jalapeños and said not to put them on his food and they were on it, in turn making the food inedible. The drive to them isn't worth $8, so now my boyfriend isn't eating dinner. We've been coming here for over a year and while in-restaurant is ok, takeout is horrible. Sorry, but after this experience we will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm that picky female when asked \"where do you want to eat?\" Always replies with the \"I don't know I don't care\" since moving to Cornelius almost a year ago my response is a quick \"El Toro!!!!\" I love this restaurant the Macho Chimi is my favorite!!!! Quick, inexpensive and tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Finally something that can last in this space. Service is very fast, very friendly, every time. Typical large mexican menu, large portions at great prices. Chips and salsa are always good, sangria is good and the beers cold. The Fajitas are a regular favorite and even split the single portion with extra guac salad. Makes for a great simple date night anytime. Can usually be out in 30 minutes if needed."}
{"text":"Always quick service and food is hot and fresh.  Favorite salsa I've found in NC thus far."}
{"text":"I was craving huevos rancheros for Sunday brunch and decided to try this place out. They don't have brunch style menu but they do offer their version of huevos rancheros. It's not your typical corn tortilla topped with refried beans, over easy eggs and tomatillo sauce. They serve it with flour tortillas on the side, eggs are over hard and red sauce. Delicious. A little on the salty side but it satisfied my craving. Good flavors, nothing lacking. Service was quick and our table was supplied with chips and mild salsa. I'll definitely be back to try out other goodies in their extensive menu. Vegetarian friendly and many seafood options."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Staff and food is outstanding, family ran and is a great place for lunch or dinner.  I also utilize the carry out services. Big Bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Read a few reviews which tout El Toro as much better than La Unica... sorry to say I can't agree. For me, La Unica is still our go-to Mex, and one of our neighbors, a transplanted Bay Area Mexican, agrees.

But El Toro is adequate and I would return if I didn't want to brave the wait at La Unica. I had the Carnitas dinner, not on the menu, and it was good, as was the top shelf marg. My dining companion complained on excessive breading on the Chile Relleno and didn't care much for the standard salsa but liked the salsa piquante which we asked for. She also liked her burrito and skinny marg."}
{"text":"Keeps Getting Better

I have been coming to El Toro every now and then and all I can say, it keeps getting better.

I've also been to events catered by them and they do a great job there as well.

My most recent visit was several weeks ago when my wife and some of her friends went to a show at the Belk Theater so I had to fend for myself.

Thought a bit and decided on El Toro. Walked in and was promptly seated at a nice table off to the side.

Menu, chips and salsa and my beverage order was there in record order.

As I looked over then menu, I sampled the Chips and Salsa, Great way to start off dinner. Chips were nice and fresh and still hot. Salsa had a fresh spicy taste that was refreshing.

By this time, I had decided on the Monster Steak Burritto. I know I referred to it as a Giant in the picture I posted by Giant does not go far enough. The official name in the menu refers to it as Monster Steak Burritto.

Monster it is because it covers all of one plate with a little room left over for the guacamole, the pico de gallo and the salad.

The flavor is great with a good balance of cheese, meat etc. Steak is good although a bit overcooked.

Considering how little they charge for it, one of the best values in Cornelius or anywhere else in the area.

Service is great and Atmosphere is excellent as well.

Great place to unwind with a cold Corona and Lime, Marquerita or what ever. Beware the sweetened tea because like most places around here, way too much sugar.  Order 1/2 and 1/2 instead and you will find it to be still a bit on the sweet side.

Good place for solo dining or for large groups. Works either way."}
{"text":"Fresh salsa and chips to start. Nice margarita. Extensive menu. Good authentic Mexican. Fast service and fun atmosphere. Great Cinco de Mayo festivities!"}
{"text":"I'm picky about Mexican food. Whether it's authentic or americanized...I have my favorites and they both need to taste good. El Toro does not fail the star rating it has been given. The Mexicanos tacos are steak/chorizo and a very spicy sauce...ala what you probably get from a good taco truck, and they were SO GOOD. Seriously spicy and I absolutely loved it. My husband had the regular steak tacos and he raved about those too! The rice and beans weren't anything special, and the salsa is better at Unica imo. The bar inside seems very clean and large...I can see myself sitting there and having a few drinks."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today.  The service was great.  Chips came out with a medium spicy salsa.  I like a chunkier salsa wife liked this salsa better.  Big menu.  I had a pork burrito and it was very good.  I am a big fan of Zapatas and I don't think it is any better then Zapatas."}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff is great, margaritas really good.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried El Toro for the first time last night. Very good experience. Nice atmosphere, spacious, and friendly service. Oversized Margheritas and draft Corona are a plus. Extensive menu, very quick service and very good food at reasonable prices. Will be our go to place when we want Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great service... Been there several times and the food has not disappointed me at any time. The tamales are the best in the area. Drinks are reasonable and the beer is super cold. Please try it."}
{"text":"Terrible to their servers. Making their servers pay for the kitchen's mistakes. Racist kitchen workers. A bunch of losers."}
{"text":"Very good! And quick service too. I ordered the Macho Chimi - which gave me enough food for almost 3 meals! My only complaint was the free chips and salsa (which really, you cant complain about if they're given to you for free!!) But they were just ok."}
{"text":"The manager Jorge is wonderful. The wait staff is friendly and the food is really good. The menu offers more than the average Mexican restaurant. Try the chicken soup. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For Americanized Mexican food, this place is excellent. It's also very reasonably priced, especially the combo plates, which at the time of this review, were all $8.75.  Portions were generous, so you're definitely getting your money's worth. We also liked that the salsa served with the chips was mild, so kids (or grown ups who don't want spicy food) can eat it. So many restaurants miss badly on this point. Don't worry, though; if you like it hot, there are a few different hot sauces on the table to kick the salsa up a notch or five. Based on items consumed by our party, I can say that the enchiladas, burritos, and chiles rellenos are quite good. The tacos were just average, because the ground beef was really, really bland. Some more seasoning (cumin, salt, pepper,chili powder, garlic) would be helpful. The margaritas were pretty good, though not exceptional. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Food came out within a reasonable time. Drinks stayed filled. 

Overall, I'd say this place is better than most of its nearby competition. Give them a shot."}
{"text":"Good, quick & everything you want in a Mexican restaurant, the drinks are strong, the portions are big & the service is Bueno...hands down, BEST MEXICAN NORTH OF CHARLOTTE, NC...Lake People, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. So much potential and yet fails at nearly every level. Three of us went in Tuesday night. The hostess was nowhere to be found. We waited patiently for almost ten minutes before even seeing an employee. Finally, as we were getting ready to leave, one of the servers sat us. We then placed our drink order immediately with the same server that sat us. Fifteen minutes later, my wife went to the front to find out if we did in fact actually have a server. The server came over in a huff and asked us what we wanted. We placed our meal order and still did not have the frozen margarita I had ordered from the get go. The server then told me the bartender had turned off the margarita machine. At 5:30 on a Tuesday night??!! Come on. The food eventually came out another 25 minutes later. My fajitas wee incredibly tough. They did taste good though and the rest of the food was fantastic. We then waited, yet again, to get the bill. I had to run down the server to get it and then he disappeared. I had to hunt down the hostess to pay for my tab. The bill we received at the table was correct but when they ran my card, it was for a higher price than the one we got at the table. They had \"mistakenly\" added a second margarita to the bill. They could not figure out how to fix it so they asked if I would just take cash. Once again, the food was average, definitely not your 'real' Mexican food stop, the atmosphere was nice but forget about service or a quick bite to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pitcher of top shelf margaritas at a fabulous price!"}
{"text":"First time here, ordered to go over the phone. Very polite and easy to understand. Menu so big had a hard time deciding! Ordered for 3 ppl and we all really enjoyed the food! Had the macho chimi with chicken, which was drenched in queso sauce, absolutely delicious! Guacamole that came with it was not the best, that's ok tho. Tacos Monterey- chicken, very good, pico, cheese and lettuce come in a separate container- steak tacos is the same. Chips and salsa were delish, as were rice and beans. No reason not to come back! One thing tho- even tho we ordered just 3 meals we ended up with 8 aluminum containers of various sizes, rice and beans in two, 3 meals in three, and lettuce, pico, cheese in three. I just wish it wasn't so wasteful and they could save on their end too. At least they are recyclable :) can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"This is my fav Mexican restaurant in this area. Quick n friendly service. I personally love pollo el toro but so far whatever we ordered, we loved! And the margaritas are big!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and reasonably priced.  Great entree selection.  Super margaritas.  Attentive service.  Good for large parties too."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, good.  They have a very extensive menu, but you're sure to find many great options to keep you coming back for more.  The lunch menu highlights some of their best dishes.  Seriously, in a hurry?  You can get in and out in half an hour, if needed.  It is a large restaurant, so it can look empty, even with 50 people in it.  They have a great covered patio, to enjoy when weather permits.

i personally like the tortilla soup, the nachos, the chicken & spinach, or a good ole quesadilla.  Variety, for sure.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but honestly the service was so bad I wouldn't come back. We were treated like an inconvenience from the moment we got there. The server was rude, didn't check on us once, and there were about 10 servers just standing around talking to one another at the front of the restaurant so its not like he was too busy to check. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday right around noon.  They have the usual complementary chips and salsa.  Salsa was good, but no real heat to it.  I am not sure if they have a spicier version.   Service was very fast, and courteous but they rush (they don't rush the patrons they just zip around!).  Lunch combos are really inexpensive, $4.99 for a taco, enchilada and beans.  Everything was good!  If I worked nearby I would definitely put this place in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and away from my all time favorite Mexican restaurant. Ordered the fajitas to go. Husband brought it home and to my surprise the fajitas had a ton of meat but only TWO tortillas. There was literally no way possible to fit all the ingredients into those two small tortillas. I called. Spoke to the manager. He gave me the \"too bad, that's how everyone does it\". I assured him that is not the case. He told me I can always ask for more. So I asked if he would charge me if I did. He said yes. Unacceptable! They don't give you enough tortillas for the meat they provide and they will charge you if you ask for more! I told him I would not be back. He didn't care and seemed fine with it. Too bad really, we eat ALOT of Mexican takeout and were really looking for someplace good close by."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican I've found in the Charlotte area. I've been here about 8 times and have had consistently great food and service. Servers are attentive, food comes out quickly and is delicious, and prices are pretty low."}
{"text":"Margaritas are delicious, salsa is tasty- I've had the enchiladas Popeye and the tortilla soup, they were both really good. Will be back for sure, gonna try the fish tacos next!"}
{"text":"I'm stunned that El Toro could be rated 4.5 stars.  At best it is an adequate bland Americanized restaurant with no authenticity. I should have walked out when offered a Diet Pepsi. 

The chips were stale and the sauce bland.  The five enchiladas were muddled mess with no distinct taste. 

I'd recommend the Indian restaurant across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the LKN area!! Great guacamole and salsa. Chicken fajitas are delicious and so are all the other dishes we've tried thus far. Don't forget to order a margarita!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place last week and I have to say it is refreshing to find a place that not only has a great menu and service but also doesn't overcook their chips.  We used to go to La Unica because the service at Chicos is so lame but then Unica followed the same pattern once they moved to the bigger space and the service went down there as well.  El Toro has got our business now!!!"}
{"text":"Always great food!  We have eaten in and taken out and have never had a problem.  The food is consistently good and not expensive for what you get. They are always friendly!  Our go to Mexican restaurant...hope they never leave!"}
{"text":"El Toro is always great, fresh and fast. Great service and variety. Their tortilla soup is so good."}
{"text":"Ok, I tried this place because so many people told us how amazing it was. We usually go La Unica but wanted to try something new since that place got big and the service has not been so good. It was OK, nothing special. The prices are good but the quality of the meat was not as good as we have had in other places. The drink was nice and strong but the glasses so thick It looked like more in it.  It was not bad, but not as good as I was expecting. The place is nice and large . I would have loved so see a small Mexican band or just some Mexican music.  Not so sure if I would go back"}
{"text":"What a great find this place is.  Tried La Unica a few weeks ago and was rather disappointed.  Tonight we wanted Mexican, so we gave this place a shot, and we're glad we did.  We got take out so we didn't experience the serving aspect, but our orders were ready within 15mins, and were absolutely delicious.  While waiting I looked around.  Decent bar area with several TVs. The seated area isn't overly big, so I assume they could be on a wait on weekends

I had the steak and cheese burrito was very tasty and moist (despite negative reviews).  My wife got the chicken quesadilla and she loved them (easy to please).  We will definitely be back for carry out and dine in.  Much better quality and prices than La Unica IMO."}
{"text":"El Toro you have found the perfect home!!  Margaritas are outstanding!  The food is amazing and service... Well, I've lived in the lake norman area for ten years and the service at el toro is unmatched!!"}
{"text":"Love it!   Finally some good Mexican at exit 28.   
Great margaritas (had the Cadillac) and a good mix of traditional and Americanized dishes.   Worth a try.  I have and will come back.  
Have had some of the best tex-mex in houston a and San Antonio and Arizona.   Between 4 and 5 stars, but for Cornelius and price, let's go 5."}
