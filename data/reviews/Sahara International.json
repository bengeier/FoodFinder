{"text":"I like Sahara very much, but I do think that Nate's is better. Still, it's quite good (very juicy kebabs) and I think even cheaper than Nate's."}
{"text":"My dad has taken me here a few time. He recommended that I try the mensaf dish. It was delicious. I have yet to try anything else there. The restaurant has a nice casual look with a Middle East vibe. It's a family-owned place and the service is very good. I highly recommend it. And let me know what other dishes are good."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We liked the traditional Middle Eastern Culture of this restaurant."}
{"text":"SKIP!!!

Okay I'm recommending you fly by this place without thinking twice not because the food is bad (I don't know) but I entered and the lady at the front was so incredibly rude I just left. Pretentious. 

So. Yeah. I just went across the street to Abu Ali. I'll write a review or this place later. 

Hungry and annoyed :)"}
{"text":"Came to visit the family and my sister suggested sahara for a late evening dinner. Wow! Everything was sooo delicious. We both got the Sahara Platter. The meat tender. Grape leaves done right. Basmati rice with caramelized onions and a few raisins mixed in...perfect! We split some sort of veggie sampler platter that included hummus, baba ganoush , tabouli and falafel. Each were great. The falafel, best I've ever had. Really. I've eaten at many a Lebanese and middle eastern restaurant in LA and nothing compares. The wait staff was very friendly and food came at a quick to reasonable pace. The place itself is traditional and casual. They also had some sort of large pistachio cookie that hit the spot. I will be back next time I'm in town. .......My nephew was able to eat too. They have an American kids menu. He had chicken fingers and fries. He gobbled down the whole thing and also enjoyed the cookie."}
{"text":"Sahara is a great middle eastern diner serving everything from kebabs, tawook, kefta, and kibbeh, to fries and chicken. The (mostly young) staff are quite helpful, but maybe almost condescending if you're an anglo ordering from the more traditional section of the menu.

My wife absolutely loved the relish tray you're brought... if you love your vegetables (exotic and household) pickled, you'll love it here.  The desserts are also rumored to be awesome.

Last tip: don't get a window seat on a hot sunny afternoon!"}
{"text":"This in my favorite middle-eastern restaurant in the Cleveland area, and among my favorite restaurants in the area.  It is extremely reasonably priced.  The food here is very authentic--be prepared for a rough ride: it can be quite spicy and the flavors quite intense.  The food is coarse and rugged...very filling, sometimes surprising you with the vivid flavors.  I love it.

I must emphasize--this place is very very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is simple but nice; sometimes you will find a rowdy group of men arguing in Arabic about which soccer game to watch.  You feel almost as if you've stepped into a different world."}
{"text":"This is my favorite middle eastern restaurant ever. Also, one of my favorite and most frequented places in Cleveland. I love it.

The starter plate is my number one addiction. I have never had a better hummus in my life. The starter plate comes with hummus, baba and tabouli, which is great to mix together.

I love the Chicken Shwarma sandwich, and my b/f loves the different vegan options. Maja dara (sp?!!) is his favorite, and he likes the falafel for a lighter lunch alongside the sampler.

Sometimes you have to wait a while for the food, but we really love the servers there. Great, authentic place. I love it."}
{"text":"I had a very good meal here.  I don't think the address is correct, unless there are 2 Saharas, but I couldn't find it at the listed address.  I found it at 12501 Lorain Road.

My Meat Shawerma sandwich was absolutely fantastic.  The Fattoush was good but a bit dry, as was the Tabouli.  We really didn't care for the Hummous, but all in all a good meal.

Plus, I found they carry Guava juice!  My son loves that stuff, we call it the \"magic elixir\"!"}
{"text":"Every single time the Old Man comes to town, this is our meeting place. For that reason alone, it holds a special place in my heart. Everything that I have tried on the menu has been outstanding. I prefer most menu items to those of Nate's Deli, only with the exception of hummus. The grape leaves, shish tawook, kafta and kabob are awesome. You can get all of the above mentioned items along with some tasty rice for around $13. I think it is called the Sahara platter or something. I really have not been disappointed. I find the service to be quick and attentive. A nice atmosphere to have conversation and great food."}
