{"text":"Wow! You guys sure are idiots! Seems your $30,000 typical Scottsdale millionaire clientele are going to cater you right out of business and your doormen are doing a great job of being douches!  Some well known clothing, music and restaurant industry people came out, and wanted to just do bottle service and stay away from the crowd and lay low, and are known immediately in the Cali area, but were not recognized by your idiots at the door.   No worries! Were known right away across the street and were comped and treated the way we were supposed to be treated.  Not that anyone needs to be comped, but it's just how business goes and the tip is always a beautiful site right?  Trust me, we take very good care of our servers.   Well, anyway, Good job! Just like I remember Scottsdale, full of trash and wannabes.  At least Cali isn't as racist lol.  That's ok, sheriff Joe was pardoned by your orange leader. LOL! Good luck! You lost some good references this go around! You'll need the luck!  The added amount of misogyny and racism to the whole experience was so interesting and incredible that I honestly don't know that I still can fully grasp it.   Did this place hire the doormen as a joke? Is this for real? I'm sick and feel like this must be a reality show.  Is this an experiment? A social experience? A prank? Real life?! Come on?! Seriously?!  If I still lived here I would bomb this place with pussy hats and an equal opportunity march.   What a joke!!!! And you want to present yourself as Cuban?! Get outta here! You're a lily white, frat baby boy!!!!  I'm a girl and I can kick your ass! At anything!!! Smdh"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 9 for brunch, got a nice booth but then had several more people join us.  They offered to move us to a larger booth without any complaints.  $20 champagne bottles with OJ are great and our server Cara was on top of everything keeping our champagne poured and water full!  Great day time hang out spot!  Nice South Beach vibe, good music from the DJ, not too loud so we could all talk and hear each other, check it out!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The short bald man who runs security at the women's bathroom takes payment to let people in before those who have been waiting in line and grabs women by the waist to herd them in like cattle. When I told him to not touch the women he threatened me and told me I should have been smart enough to pay him. Love to see misogyny at play in positions of power at bars :)"}
{"text":"Drinks are tasty music is great the food is awesome great atmosphere I feel like I'm in Miami."}
{"text":"Riot house has improved so much! I haven't been back in for food yet but the DJ plays Latin music to go with the Miami theme and the head bartender makes amazing drinks for how busy they are they hustle through pouring too! Great improvement!!"}
{"text":"This is the best new bar in Scottsdale. The riot hospitality group has outdone themselves."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe, me and my girlfriends are always looking for the best new spots and I definitely think that this is going to be a killer place to start going to. Their drinks are phenomenal there's not many places in the Scottsdale area that I actually have cool interesting drinks. I definitely recommend hitting their menu they have fantastic food as well."}
{"text":"Such an awesome venue! It has a very high class beachy feel. Loved their specialty drinks - especially the Kombucharita and the Shrub A Dub Dub. Another great unique addition to Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Trash. If these guys don't figure out their lines, business will continue to walk away. You can't discriminate day one. Or ignore the population that will keep you alive."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Regina George bartenders. Shitty people (see: Jean Ralphio, SUR), Beware: large congregation of fuckboys."}
{"text":"New favorite brunch spot! Ate all of the amazing food before we could get a picture. Had the vegetable crustless quiche which came with a perfect side salad, breakfast flatbread that I'd prob the best pizza I've had in a while, but the potato casserole...omg. Must try the sparkling melon, key lime martini with ice (pictured) and chia seed trilogy (pictured)."}
{"text":"Newest, hottest club in Scottsdale. Huge screens everywhere, great ambiance. I think once they work out the \"we're new\" kinks, it will be fantastic. They have a ton of bartenders, drink wait isn't horrible considering how busy it can be.  Biggest negative: Not enough women's restroom stalls. Be prepared to wait in a long line!"}
{"text":"Craft cocktails are off the charts and bbq chicken flatbread is . Can't wait to watch games on their ginormous LED screen. Great new spot in old town with a chill, beachy vibe. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with expectations like all the other places in Scottsdale. Their kitchen was closed on a Sunday @ 7 pm. Secondly the bartenders was inexperienced. Anything beyond your standard jack and coke will be difficult to get made. Thirdly, culturally I've haven't been able to understand the underline racist tones of the dress code in Scottsdale. This place just like the others will give you the fifth degree about your shoes if they are Jordan's or Nike shoes worn by the very men that are playing on there TV's during basketball games. Open minded critic. Hopefully they will improve as the new kids on the block."}
{"text":"Good unique cocktails and the food is great!  Loved the vibe of this place. Next time I'm back in The area I'm definitely going again!"}
{"text":"I brought my out of town friends to old town and we saw that Riot House was new and decided to try it out.. we had a lot of fun on the dance floor. I decided to join my friends for a cig out in the front and when we tried to get back in they said we \"were too intoxicated\" and wouldn't let us back in... then we couldn't get in anywhere after that. I honestly don't understand it. There were so many more people more intoxicated than us, we in no way were obviously drunk. Really disappointed. Don't recommend drinking here because they'll kick you out with the slightest buzz."}
{"text":"They have a really good brunch. I like the quiche and a breakfast flatbread with chicken sausage. They also have really good mimosas. I recommend going with a bunch of friends for brunch for champagne on Sunday Funday. Fun new place to get happy hour as well, great food great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like the layout,  and the music is on point.  But,  the bar is under staffed and there are servers standing around doing nothing, very frustrating when you stand there for 20 mins waiting to order a order a drink. And I feel like the bartender is bias. She went to a lot of other men before my black husband."}
{"text":"I'm not a person to go out much but I'm not even kidding. It was an amazing vibe and great place to hang with my friends and just let lose. Me and my friends felt welcomed (especially coming from the west side to Scottsdale)  I think it was the door man or a manager, I don't remember what he was but I remembered his name, it was Nicholas Knudsen who treated us like we were VIP's walking in. I'd highly suggest this place to anybody who wants to enjoy a good time with people who know how to cater to their clients!"}
{"text":"Riot House is the latest creation from the people who own Whiskey Row and El Hefe, two other popular bars located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale bar district.  Is it an ok bar? Sure. Then, why only two stars, you may ask? Because Riot House adds nothing new to the nightlife district. It is nearly identical to the other two bars in layout, food choices, music and overall feel. The only real difference is in the back wallpaper has a giant palm leaf print and a few fake hanging plants scattered around. Riot House is like those cookie cutter, generic houses in suburbia. Basically everything looks the same except the paint colors and the layout is flipped. The biggest, hottest bar district in the state of Arizona needs to keep creatively changing to stay on top. Sadly, the newest bar is just more of the same."}
