{"text":"This east side butcher shop is another one of Cleveland's AMAZING deli spots for corned beef and pastrami (and roasted brisket, and salami, and turkey, and, well, you get the picture...). I've never had the pleasure of buying a big ol' hunk of meat from here that wasn't wedged between two pieces of bread, but given how top-notch the sandwiches are, I'm sure this place is perfect for all your carnivorous needs. (Yes, I am aware that the phrase \"carnivorous needs\" sounds like a cast-off line from my non-Yelp writing gig as acclaimed romance novelist Danielle Steele.)  Seriously, the meats here are so tender you'll probably sweat gravy.  Most of the sandwiches come in small/medium/large sizes, and are priced, like, $5.95/7.95/9.95, give or take a few cents depending on the variety. Some, like the Reuben, are only in one size. There's a 10 buck boxed lunch that comes with a sandwich, a pickle, potato/mac salad, chips, a cookie and a pop, and a cheaper combo box that's $7.50.  Oh, and there is no seating inside so you'll have to take that puppy back to your home or place of business (but if you're like me you'll just woof it down in your car)."}
{"text":"Cleveland sure does seem to have a lot of top notch locales slinging brisket in it's varied forms, and as I discovered today, Mr. Brisket is up there along with similar civic luminaries like Slyman's and Corky & Lenny's!    I popped in shortly after noon and was quickly greeted by the friendly guy behind the counter who took my order for the Charles Barr sandwich - a combo of corned beef and pastrami.  It was cool to be able to see the guy slice up both cuts to order, and I was out of there in no time.  I don't always need the sandwich to be piled obscenely high like it seems every other place does, so this slightly more modest-sized option is good to have, and at $7.50 a pop is a good value as well.  I saw on their menu that they have sandwich specials on Tuesday and Sunday, so will have to come back on one of those days for sure.    But man, that Charles Barr with the perfect smokiness in the pastrami and melt in your mouth corned beef is something to behold!"}
{"text":"Agree with all the positive reviews mentioning corn been and pastrami. Just wanted to add that their steaks are also amazing. Great place, owner always remembers my name!"}
{"text":"My family has bought corned beef from  Mr. Brisket for years now, especially for St. Patrick's Day, because it is the best in town. Not only is the product good, but the service and employees are as well. You can see that they pride themselves on a good quality of food at an affordable price. Whether you are looking to purchase meat for a special occasion or just a carry out lunch for the day, Mr. Brisket is one of the best you will find in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is the place to go in the Heights for all things meat. Ribs are top notch. They are always super helpful. Their sandwiches will make your brain explode (seriously)."}
{"text":"First time at Mister Brisket and it was amazing. Let me start by saying that the service was great and very fast. The food ... Woah!  It was great. I had a corned beef and pastrami sandwich. It was made to order, moist and so so satisfying. Go go go eat here!"}
{"text":"I was reading the other reviews and its all true! This place has the best meat. They carry Berkshire pork, nobody else has it and it melts in your mouth. Their corned beef is awesome the pastrami is awesome and their brisket will leave you speechless.  Anytime you have a question about meat, these guys have a Ph.D in it.,and are more then happy to share their knowledge. The best part is the prices! They are better then the grocery store and the meat is better!"}
{"text":"I called mr.b for the first time yesterday for a pick-up. he was closed but offered to make my order if i was there in 10 min. man, i got there in 5. he unlocked the door and let me in while he finished my order. food was just as good as his customer service. amazing dude, with crazy good food."}
{"text":"I was very hopeful that the food would meet my high expectations (based on reviews). Unfortunately, the Reuben was mediocre and the dead fly I discovered in the middle of the sandwich was horrifying. I shudder to think that I could have taken a bite without looking! Things happen, I know, but this was a huge turn off. Perhaps I should have taken note of the less than stellar appearance of the place and backed out the door. On a positive note, the young man who served me was helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some NYE beef, the two gentleman working the front of house were busy with phone orders and online orders, but stopped what they were doing to help me figure out what would fit my menu, and also be cost efficient. Really really knowledgeable staff. As i was waiting for my beef tenderloin to be butchered to my specifications i noticed that they had a tuesday special, $5.95 for a large corned beef sandwich with any additional purchase. Let me just tell you this is the best corned beef you will ever have. simply amazing. I'll be going back for more butchered meat and deli meats."}
{"text":"I had to follow through considering the great reviews. This morning I had the best corned beef sandwich I've ever consumed: texture and taste unmatched by my experiences which include many NYC and L.A. venues. Looks like Taylor Road will be a frequent destination."}
{"text":"Oh yea... Mr Brisket does have one of my favorite deli sandwiches in Cleveland called \"The Duke\".  It is about a pound of Turkey, Brisket, Corned Beef and some sort of Salami with Thousand Island and Swiss.  It is great for those who love their meat injection. Their BBQ Brisket is also amazing.  Get a sandwich of it on white bread. Pure heaven!!!   They also have these Veal Thai Sausages that are spectacular on the grill.  Each bundle feeds two and it adds big style points to your BBQ."}
{"text":"I am of the clan of Reuben Fiends. You can tell we're coming from the scent of thousand Island wafting through the air a full two minutes before we enter the room. We try to insert the word \"corned\" into as many sentences as possible. And we hover dangerously close to proposing marriage to a man who has good sauerkraut.   Well, fellow fiends, the quest is over, because the best Reuben in Cleveland, nay, the state, has been found! It resides in Mister Brisket, in a charmingly humble store with friendly staff who will learn your name and ask you how your family has been. Forget Slyman's, they're a one trick pony that thinks more meat = better meat, and that's just not true. Quality over quantity dictates Mister Brisket comes out on top.   All the meats here are of solid quality, and locals in the know are aware that this is the place to get the best steak or burger or ribs for their next cookout. The smells alone when you step in the door here will make you swoon in carnivore heaven.  All sandwiches you can order come quick, and are reasonably priced. They run great Tuesday deals on the sandwiches, so I would always come on Tuesday for the discount. I love their pastrami and corned beef.   Their Reuben is a work of art. You know this place means business when the second you order your sandwich they get a massive fork and take a large hot side of corned beef out of a delicious bath and slice it fresh to layer on the sandwich. The bread is the right kind of rye, the kraut is assertive, they are not stingy with the thousand island, and they press the sandwich enough to really perfectly melt the cheese and get a buttery crunch on the outside. But the star of the sandwich, and 80% of its bulk is succulent, fall apart thick sliced corned beef. It's handheld perfection, this sandwich.    Run (at least that way you can burn off some of the calories preemptively) to Mister Brisket, unhinge jaw and insert perfect Reuben. I'll race you there!"}
{"text":"We got some meats including skirt steak and it was very good.  We also got the half corned beef half pastrami sandwich and it too was very good not as big as slymans but good."}
{"text":"We stopped into Mr. Brisket for lunch today and were pleasantly surprised. The pastrami and corned beef were outstanding and the people were super friendly. It's carry out only, but I wished they had a few tables outside where we could enjoy them."}
{"text":"Excellent Pastrami sandwich, friendly service, and their cuts of meat are fantastic.  There's always people who find subjective things to whine about on yelp, but there's no denying that this place is excellent and fairly priced.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I would bring my own bread, next time.  But this place is damn good!"}
{"text":"What's for dinner?  Stoll into this tiny shop and look on the chalkboard menu.  Or look in their website and place a phone order.  THE finest cuts of meat and poultry around.  I picked up the most beautiful and delicious USA Prime hanger steaks.  Folks there are very helpful and know their stuff.  This is not a place you sirt down and eat..get your food and carry it out.  Excellent."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I first discovered Mister Brisket, and they have only improved (they have a dining room now). This is a great butcher's shop, but I want to talk about the pastrami. Two slices of Schwebels (Youngstown born Youngstown Bread), a slice of cheese, a squirt of mustard, and the best pastrami I can even contemplate. Heaven every time I go.  And the folks are great too. The old man's got stories, Hank's got jokes, and once Mrs. Herskovitz (I think) gave me a slice of lemony cake that I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"First things first: I had just returned from the East coast and I got a little spoiled there. I was hoping to find hand carved Pastrami like I had in Philly in the Reading Terminal at Herschel's. Hence the four stars are only because I REALLY wanted the hot hand carved stuff.  I am lucky enough to know some great  food people and when I asked a local chef who has done a great job putting Cleveland  eats in the national food spotlight  \"where can I get the best Pastrami in Cleveland\" He said go to Mr.Brisket. I grabbed my passport and crossed the Cuyahoga to \"the other side\" and hunted down this little gem. I THOUGHT it was a sit down place, WRONG!   The owner was extremely genial when asked what brought me in. He basically said \"we are butcher shop that sells sandwiches\". They have a fabulous seletion of meats they offer as well as do catering. He was happy to \"talk shop\" as he quickly pulled out my much desired Romanian Pastrami and got to slicing my sandwich and 2 lbs to take home. My only bummer here is that I was really hoping for hot of of the oven and it was cold from yesterday, BUT it heated beautifully. While waiting for him to finish slicing, he pulled out a freshly cooked corned beef and put it out samples for  me and other customers who had begun to queue up. It was heavenly, almost melted like butter on your tongue...even outdid Slyman's.  While I still want to try my own hand at making pastrami at home, I will most definitely go back and you should too and this time I will grab some of the Thai sausage!  1 downside, bread quality...too squishy...I like a more hearty bread to hold the goodness and I don't think it needs mustard. The flavor is subtle and needs no \"window dressing\""}
{"text":"No frills, no fluff, no veggies...just the best corned-beef in the Clown...the bread is just so you don't get your hands smelling like you want to eat them.  This place has a real meat-atude."}
{"text":"One of the best butcher shops I have ever been to. The owner is extremely knowledgable and very helpful. The quality of the meats is top notch. Whenever I need some fantastic meats, this is the first place I go."}
{"text":"Dear Mr Brisket, or should I call you Mister? Thank you, thank you, thank you for supplying me with my midwest/Northeastern corned beef sandwich fix. Growing up in Michigan, I am used to having my sandwiches as big as my hands. Your meat was delicate and fresh, it melted in my mouth. Thank you for telling me the meat actually comes from Michigan, the sandwich tasted every bit of \"home\". Your mustard had just the amount of fresh kick I needed, and your bread was soft and fresh. I wish I had time to come back and try your potato salad, but sadly I did not. The chip options satisfied me and your choice of beverages was just right. From the moment I called and ordered a pick-up, I knew you were the one and you DID NOT disappoint. You have no seating, but who can sit with the anticipation of having you? I even ate the whole sandwich at once when I got back to my destination. I know, don't look at me like that. It had been ssssoooo long, I am not ashamed. I planned on saving one half like a squirrel saving nuts for winter. I ate the first half...looked at the other, licked my fingers, and that was all she wrote wrote.  I guess that's the only good thing about us being so far apart. There probably will never be a \"next time\", but at least you reminded me of why I love the famous Jewish Deli's of NY/DC/Chicago so much.   P.S. Don't the best always wind up being in a little hole in the wall? Your memory brings a tear to my eye as I write this.   P.P.S Can you overnight FedEx me a sammich? :-("}
{"text":"Unbelievable, how have I been in Cleveland for 5 years and never heard of this place.  Stopped in today after I found it on the internet, I have had Rubens from L.A. (CANTORS) to N.Y. (Katz) and this stands up to either and anywhere in between.  My friend had the BBQ Brisket and said it was one of the best Sandwiches he has ever had.  It's really a specialty butcher shop so only to go on the Sammie's.   Got a few items to try from the wide variety of meats.  Stock pot is on already making some chicken broth.  Will let you know how it goes.  Just for the record, they couldn't be nicer folks."}
{"text":"If you enjoy eating delicious corned beef while standing, this is the place. I have been coming here for their corned beef for years now, and always enjoyed it. Not a place for a date (unless you wanted it to be an awesome one) as there is not really a dining area aside from the loose chairs floating around.  They also have excellent butchering services. I have gotten delicious meat slabs from them, and they always prove to be the highest quality. They also have dry aged products worth trying."}
{"text":"The BEST pastrami I've ever had I've been to Katz and I've been to Swartz in Montreal   This place is better than both"}
{"text":"This tiny hole in the wall is a hidden jem.  It's easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. I've been going here for years.  It's a family owned carryout deli /butcher shop.  It has some of the best corned beef and pastrami in the city. The owner may seem surly but is a very friendly guy, actually everyone there is friendly. The sandwiches come in three sizes- scooby (small), large and extra large.  They also have \"boxed lunches\" which is basically a combo meal - sandwich (small or large), pickle,chips,cookie, and a drink.   Everything is reasonably priced.  They have strange days/hours, so it's best to call or check online."}
{"text":"A quick Yelp search brought me to Mister Brisket and their Reuben Sandwich will bring me back. I asked them to make me their best Reuben so they whipped me up a 1/2 pastrami 1/2 corned beef melt in your mouth panini. With just a few items on the menu, Mister Brisket delivers Quality, specializing in meats, particularly beef. I can't wait to try their Brisket next time. Vegans Avoid!"}
{"text":"Just commenting on the service because unlike Richard H's prediction, I just recently became a vegetarian (well, pescetarian.)   I came here to pick up a sandwich for my bf to try out, and I have to say that this local establishment is one that I think everyone should support b/c of their awesome owner and other guys behind the counter.  Before they found out that I was a veggie lover, they put a bunch of samples on the counter for all to try after I announced that it was my first time there. Generous.  They busted my chops in a way that only Clevelanders can get away with. At the same time, the owner is cultured and aware of Cleveland goings-on (he was up to date about Cleveland Orchestra performances)... we are a city full of paradoxes!  By the way, I got the corned beef + pastrami sandwich (there are deals on Tuesdays!) and he loved it."}
{"text":"i was buying food here for a few years. just found a new website that gives restaurant inspection results in cuyahoga county= cuy. cty board of health.  mr brisket is a dirty place with 5 critical violations- equal to a \"d\" rating. i am very disappointed in them because they are in my neighborhood. do not eat here and go on that website to check out all restaurants before you eat there."}
{"text":"This place has the best corned brisket and the best service. I was walking around the area while waiting to be served at the nearby DMV and stumbled upon this butcher/sandwich shop. Immediately was given some amazing samples, which then prompted me to order, and I wasn't even looking for anything to eat! It was that good. Definitely ask the guys who work there for recommendations, they know what they're talking about. They also had this really cool sodas. The only downside to the place is that they don't have anywhere to sit."}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN the best steak I have ever eaten! Raised in California I know good food when I see it and have been waiting for a place to try in Cleveland that makes my jaw drop. Mr.Brisket is THAT PLACE! From the service to the highest quality meat, this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"This has been on my bucket list of places to try, based on Yelp reviews.  I stopped in on a Saturday morning after a massage at Quintana's, just a few steps away.   As mentioned in other Yelp reviews, the place is not fancy, but the staff was friendly and accommodating.   There is a chalkboard, as you walk in which lists that day's offerings.   I went with the Corned Beef lunchbox special.   I watched as my sandwich was made, the corned beef was sliced to order, very generous amount on fresh rye bread (Schwebels), with mustard.   The special included cookies (packaged, nothing to write home about), your choice of salad (cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad), pickle and a soft drink.  All of this for $10!.  I arrived home, my sandwich was still warm, the pickle was crunchy and the perfect accompaniment to my sandwich, as was the macaroni salad.  This was definitely a good choice and a great value, especially compared to the $10 chicken salad sandwich (no sides), that I had the day before at Karl's Inn of the Barristers.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First visit today and I was pushed to this great little spot by fellow YELP reviews; and they didn't lie.  This is a very small shop, no dining room. The owner was present and we talked a bit. Very personable man that has a great deal of passion for his business.  He has two employees (At least that is what was present on my visit) that were fevorishly making sandwiches for either invisible guests are a ton of pickup orders. I am going to assume the later as person after person walked in, picked up an order and left. All the customers seemed delighted to be there and anxious to take a bite of their order.  With all this excitement I was not the exception.   I ordered a Ruben and got an authentic garlicy dill pickle wedge with it which was also delicious. Forget the pickle.  The sandwiches come in like 5 sizes I think, I ordered one up from the smallest and it was a boat anchor! I mean I don't even want to know what the largest looks like.  The meat was smoky, pickled perfection with some of the best sauerkraut iv'e had in a long time. The bread was fresh and had the right amount of deli-pull to it; with a tougher but not hard crust.  I will be sharing the web site with my co-workers and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best sandwich spot on the east side. Wish they were open longer, but the corned beef and brisket is the best."}
{"text":"I can't believe there's only two reviews of Mr. Brisket so far...perhaps it's because all of the people who know and love it and come here all the time don't want the secret to spread too far so they can keep the high quality of the store where it's at.  Came here on a chilly Saturday because the football games on Sunday required a menu of corned beef.  The smallest?  7 lb. for only two of us!  No worries, the guy behind the counter said for us to cook it up and then bring in what we didn't eat and they would slice it up nice and thin for us and put it in more manageable portions...for free.  Now that's what I call customer service!  So far we've only had the brisket, but from their menu, it looks like they've got almost every type of beef you could ever want to cook up, will definitely be coming here for more cuts.  We also got a pastrami with stadium mustard and sauerkraut to split for lunch, unbelievably good stuff.  The quality of the meat here is second to none.  I would love to see these guys do up a food truck in the summertime, they would have lineups down the block for these sandwiches for sure!"}
{"text":"This has been our family's go to special occasion butcher shop for decades--the very best cuts of Brisket and the recipes to go with it, and being able to bring our cooked products back for expert perfect slicing never ever disappoints.    And from time-to-time, I'd stop by and grab a great corned beef, pastrami or hot brisket sandwich for the road...but now they have a small comfortable dining room--you order at the counter and they will bring you your food!    The sandwiches are big, bigger and biggest.  BUT don't cheat yourself--order an amazing cup of chicken noodle soup to start with!  Finally, they either have or will get for you all kinds of the best meats available.  Let them be YOUR source for meat!  Great people, great food, GO THERE!"}
{"text":"For those who may share my generation's preferences Mister Brisket is not all that. I have had both corned beef and beef brisket sandwiches. In size and price they are  preferable to the over-sized-high-priced sandwiches found at more celebrated deli type eateries. The beef in both was dry for those of us not raised with fear of fat. The bread was grocery store variety. The beef was cut from a refrigerated roast then taken in the back for reheating. This odd process may account for the dryness. Yesterday as I ate my sandwich I thought I would so much prefer the brisket served on a plate with gravy. I expect if I return it will be to buy by the pound."}
{"text":"I was only in Cleveland for a couple of hours, and I'm so glad I went to Mister Brisket. The service was quick, the sandwich was excellent, and my wallet was still in good shape.   It's a great place that I will be returning to if I ever make it back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Screw the sides, stick with the meat!   The Reuben here is beyond ah-mazing and you definitely get what you pay for. It appears that this place truly takes pride in what it puts forth and their efforts have not gone unnoticed. On every sandwich that I've tried the meat has always been perfectly seasoned,  deliciously tender, and cooked so well that you'd swear you've just taken a small bite of heaven. Don't let the stores appearance fool you, judging a book by it's cover could be your biggest mistake yet."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect from this hole in the wall type place.  I asked what is best and the response was as I hoped, it's like picking your favorite kid.. I had the large brisket with thousand island and swiss.  Excellent, tasted great, just incredibly seasoned.  I brought have the sandwich back to Baltimore for my wife.  It was that large and good...even I wanted to share.  I will definitely make this trip again.  A+ brisket"}
{"text":"Got take out from here (once). We got the corned beef and the brisket sandwiches. Both were really good! I liked the corned beef better of the two, but I'd go back for anything on the menu. Their horseradish dressing is fantastic - very strong and spicy. It'll clear you out! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Pastrami! Ordered a pound... Only mistake... I should face ordered two!!!! Nice staff."}
{"text":"Where to even begin? The best pastrami in town, hands down but it doesn't stop there. We bought the best steaks that i have ever eaten in my life from Mr. Brisket. His beef is prime, even the sliced turkey is a cut above - and the owner is passionate about what he does - like no other. I bring his meat as gifts to friends! You must stop in and get a sandwich along with a few other things. It's a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"This place is great.  If you're used to the Jewish delis in NYC, come here and you'll feel a bit less homesick.  Closest thing I've found in Cleveland (at least in my short 2 yrs here).   So don't let the somewhat shabby appearance fool you- stop in and grab a sandwich.  The brisket really was delicious.  My boyfriend and I shared a large, which I regretted after.  I didn't want to share!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mr Brisket I wish you had a sister Ms. Brisket. If you did based on the corned beef I would marry her in a heart beat.  The corned beef is every bit as good as Slymans maybe even better.  They also offer a great selection of other animal protien as well."}
{"text":"In search of a great Reuben, I went to Mr Brisket led by a great reputation and raving yelp reviews.  First thing I noticed on entering was a hazy smell of scorched vegetable oil, almost like burning paint from their sandwich press.  It was not pleasant.    I read their chalkboard and it said \"All Reubens $11.95\".  Wow, their price for Reuben's have gone up a bit since the last yelper posted the photo of their chalkboard!  Thinking I was getting a huge awesome sandwich, I placed the order.  It was not bad, but not the biggest, best or even greatest.  The corned beef was excellent and the bread was very good, but it was light on the cheese, kraut and dressing.  Their sandwich press also gave it that nasty flavor of scorched oil, not a nice grilled toasted flavor.  For the size, it was definitely not worth $11.95.  The staff was very nice and the service was quick, but their corned beef deserves better presentation than the Reuben they make.    If it came off a griddle like a grilled cheese does, was bigger and had more condiments they would have something worthy of my $12."}
{"text":"This may be my all time favorite quick lunch spot in Cleveland. The lunch box is just such an amazing compilation for a good price, I just don't think it can be beaten.   I've had almost every cut of meat from Mr. Brisket, and I have to say my favorite is the Brisket. The Corned Beef is also incredible, as is the Pastrami, but the Brisket is just as good as it gets. When you combine it with the Tiger Sauce (mayo + horseradish) it makes a sandwich so delicious you kind of feel sad when (and if) you finish it.   The boxed lunch also includes a side (both the potato and macaroni salads are also insanely delicious), a soda (Dr. Brown's Black Cherry is my favorite), a pickle, and a chocolate chip cookie. Perfect.  Also everyone who works there is ridiculously friendly and will help you through everything. I'd actually recommend just going in and talking to them and they'll help you build the perfect sandwich for you."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. I like to get sandwiches to go and get meat to take home for grilling. Everything has always been great."}
{"text":"I'm a regular now, so what I'm about to say is kinda a big deal...  There's no better meat house in town. This is it. You can stop searching. In terms of varietal cuts, especially beef and pork, this is my go-to locale.   The quality is certainly top notch. You won't find browning meat sitting in a maxi pad on a foam tray here. Instead, they'll cut you a steak right there and then with a saw in the back. What you'll go home with is an ultra fresh, cut to your specification hunk of vibrant looking meat. Want a 2\" thick Ribeye? No problem. Bone-in or bone-out? No problem. Want the bones on your rack of lamb frenched? No problem.   The chalkboard in front of the counter is just a starting point to what they offer. But to get the real insight, talk to the extremely helpful Hank or Sanford. Every time I'm in, they'll go out of their way to help me through my purchase. Educating me each step of the way on the various cuts and the nuances between each. He's clearly an expert in his craft and an invaluable personality that is so hard to find these days, especially in this industry.    The last time I was in, I was looking for meat to make shish kabobs. Hank gave me his recommendation and offered to trim the fat and cut into 1\" pieces for me. Really?  Outstanding! Now that's service.   Then there was this time a year or so ago when I bought a 7lb brisket that I planned on pickling. What ever would I do with all the extras though? Hank made the recommendation to bring it back in and he'd throw it on the slicer so I could take home more manageable razor thin deli slices for corned beef sandwiches. Really? Wow.    When I gave thanks for the outstanding service, his response: \"No worries, that's my job\".   This type of personal service is refreshing and can't be found at the big box monoliths. And it's the primary reason why I'll continue to patronize mom and pop stores such as this. Mister Brisket, I'm glad you exist. You are a rare and dying breed. Don't quit doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"This is primarily a home delivery place but a few years ago they opened up the deli counter.  Nothing fancy, nothing complicated.  A menu of sandwiches with the classic sides - mac or potato salad and a pickle.   Hands down, the best pastrami sandwich I have EVER had.  The owner and his wife are extremely friendly and thet ensure that all of their products are of the best quality.  Where else can you get a great sandwich served up by a Clevelander with a PhD in pyschology?  Make sure to read the article to the right of the front door - intersting story about how they got started.    Great little place!   Check it out!"}
{"text":"The best pastrami in Cleveland, hands down. He also sells top quality meat/seafood and supplies countless of the city's top restaurants."}
{"text":"They have somewhat limited hours, and there is not much to the actual place itself- in fact you'd probably whiz right by it thinking its in a mostly unkempt building on Cedar/N.Taylor-- but if you do enter this GEM then you will find a friendly bunch of guys who will serve you up some of the most tender and delicious cuts around. Highly recommend the pulled pork - comes on a jumbo roll - thumbs way way up!!!"}
{"text":"This is a little meat shop located on the corner of  Cedar and Taylor, across from Fairmount cleaner's.  It's a little hidden - I totally would not have noticed it all but my friend (who is a big fan of corned beef) raved about this place again and again to me until I had to give it a try.  I have never been a big fan of corned beef, but this little place was a pleasant surprise to me.  They basically give you a bun that is jammed with a two inch thick wad of meat.  I've tried the corned beef and the roast beef and both are very well seasoned and delicious.  Now, every time I drop my clothes at the cleaners, I always stop by here to grab some lunch :)"}
{"text":"another hole in the wall kinda dumpy looking place .. but those are usually the best finds .. no eat in here but the 2 brisket sandwiches we took home were delicious & worth hunting this joint down .. got 2 on rye w/swiss & horseradish .. damn tasty I gotta say .. we will be back .. just wish their hours of operation were not difficult to work around the schedule of us working folks M-F"}
{"text":"Easily one of the top three deli's on the planet. Thats right, the whole darn world. The pastrami, the corned beef, the turkey...all amazing. Great bread as well, and the proverbial cherry on top is the Stadium Mustard! Take that, NY! Seriously, I've been to all the big spots in NYC, and while they are certainly good, I can do without the gimmicky sky-high pile o' meat (and subsequent sky high price). Give me this place with REAL cuts of meat for a REAL price. Dine-in is not available...just a counter and a few chairs to wait if need be. Grab a soda and some potato salad and hit the road. No fuss, no muss.   Better yet, the people who work there are all extremely friendly and helpful. They will gladly prepare what you want the way you want it, and offer great advice as well. If you are really hungry, try The Duke...a full pound of four different cuts of meat. I was able to conquer this monster but it easily could have been two meals (but, I like a challenge). Seriously, this place is a true, can't-miss gem."}
{"text":"carnivore delight genuine butcher shop with flying salamis   Aside from the great sandwiches, aside from the owner Sanford's pearls of wisdom, and aside from the salamis that dangle in various corners of the store, this is where I buy my beef, pork,chicken, lamb,and now seafood as well.   Great pricing on USDA Prime  beef, Kurobuta Pork from Amish farms near Sandusky, flavorful chickens that are not factory farmed...  ...You can NOT, EVER, go wrong with Mister Brisket.     Whole Foods beef?  Meh.  \"Kobe\" beef?  That's bullshit.  Tell you what;  Go there and ask them to cut you a 2+ inch bone-in ribeye.   Cook it using the Ducasse method linked below. http://forums.egullet.org/index.php/topic/119838-the-best-way-to-cook-a-thick-steak/   Eat it and weep.  Weep the tears of joy. This will blow your mind.  Carry on..."}
{"text":"Look for corned beef or pastrami on the East side of town? You HAVE to go to Mr. Brisket! I used to deliver for these guys in college and told everyone about this tucked away gem on S Taylor. Ask for the Charles Barr!"}
{"text":"Attention meat eaters:   Do you like pastrami? How about corned beef? If you said yes to either and have not been to Mister Brisket, you are truly missing out. The sandwiches from this place are TO DIE FOR. They have a sizable sandwich menu for takeout and the sandwiches come in a small and large size. My husband and I split a large for a light lunch. Fantastic, tender meat. Some of the absolute best corned beef and pastrami anywhere and you just can't beat the prices. For meat this good, it's worth every penny of MB's fair prices.   Grab a sandwich for lunch here and walk down to Cain park to eat it in the summertime. SO SO good."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. The corned beef is amazing (and I have been a Slyman's devotee for several years now). They are practically in my backyard and they make up tasty sandwiches lickety-split. I'm looking forward to using their catering services for the holidays. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Mr, Brisket, how do we love thee? Let me count the calories...er, ways.   Folks, if you are not familiar with Mr. Brisket's Bountiful and Beautiful Basket of Bombastic Beef (and other stuff), what the heck are you waiting for, seriously?   We have had his prepared foods at least a 1/2 dozen times in the last couple of years and every single time perfection was achieved.  Once we ordered a Reuben, finished it halfway home and damn near turned around to get another one.    This is not an eat-in place but with the quality so off-the-charts you won't care schlepping it home.  Plus, they deliver! To the West Side, too! (Apparently their drivers have passports or something and are well-known to the border guards.)   In all seriousness, this place is very special. East siders are lucky to have it in their back yard and West siders are lucky 1) it's worth the drive and 2) they deliver.    So, thank you, Mr Brisket, for being a true Cleveland Landmark, whether City Hall recognizes that or not. Your fans sure do."}
{"text":"How could I live so close to this place, but have never tried it?  I had a day off, so my friend suggested we try Mister Brisket. Oooh. \"Oh, this has been the top of the yelp list!\" I exclaimed. So off we went.  Mister Brisket is definitely one of those hole in the wall place. We parked in the old Rite Aid plaza, crossed the street and entered the small sandwich shops. The people were super friendly behind the counter, and when I asked the guy what was good, he was like, \"everything!\" with a big smile. Hmmmm.   So we studied the chalkboard and as the sandwiches looked gigantic, we both ordered budget boxes (small sandwich, with chips, cookies, and a pop..for around $7! What a deal!). Got our sandwiches quickly and walked to Cain Park to go eat them.  She got the corned beef sandwich. Mmmm. That corned beef is really good. Usually, I would never order corned beef because it's usually dosed in salt high enough to cause you to have a stroke, but really, the corned beef was just right- not too salty, and just plain good. I got the pastrami sandwich. Ooh baby, that's good.  My only gripe about the food was that the bread...kind of sucks. I mean, it's just.. bread from Schwebels (which is fine, btw). But I feel with that caliber of meat, why didn't they have amazing bread with it? Perhaps I've been spoiled with the Zingermans of Ann Arbor and what not, but....man, change that bread. It's so smooshy and flimsy. If they got some good hearty crunchy bread with that meat..it would be amazing.  Nonetheless, worth the try!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I were on a roadtrip, I saw the name and had to go here. I love meat. We talked to the owners who are super sweet, they gave us samples and holy moses the corned beef is incredible. the best I've ever had. And yes, I've been to NYC and Montreal. I even had to ask for a handful to take with me for the road in addition to my giant sandwich.  So we happened to be driving through cleveland on the way back, and we were super sad to learn they were closed on Mondays, so I emailed and asked if they would be willing to come in and just quickly sell us 5 lbs of corned beef (i know, I am that crazy, but it is THAT good). To my surprise, Mr. B wrote back and said no problem! What a guy!! So we got our corned beef to take back to chicago with us and I realized I had to write this review. Oh also, he included us in his newsletter. How cool is that? GO HERE NOW, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I worked as a driver, on occasion, for Mr. Brisket back when all they did was meat delivery. I recognized a great product back then, so when I heard they were serving sandwiches I had to get over there as soon as I could, secure in the knowledge that the quality would be unparalleled. I was right.  While there is nowhere inside to sit, the bus stop across the street makes for a nice \"urban picnic\" setting. But I didn't come to Mr. Brisket for the decor, anyway. I came for the meat. I had the Charles Barr sandwich (corned beef and pastrami on rye with Swiss and yellow mustard) and it was fantastic. Both meats were hot, tender, flavorful and top quality. I got the box lunch combination, which included the sandwich, a pop, chips, potato salad, and a cookie. All that for just $9.95, which is really a great value.  I'd be here every day for lunch if I lived closer, and I'm sure my arteries are thankful this isn't the case. Until next time, Mr. Brisket."}
{"text":"I find it rather difficult to justify the quality of food using words but here goes;  I'm from New York and I've been to legendary pastrami and corned beef places such as Katz Deli and Carnegie Deli. I think it's safe to say Cleveland has a comparable gem in Mister Brisket.  I had the \"Charles Barr\" Reuben; it was two slices of rye, pastrami, corned beef, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing and swiss. The pastrami and corned beef was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sauerkraut was very subtle. Overall the sandwich was one of the best I've ever eaten. It was nothing too crazy like Melt Bar and Grilled next door but it was tasty as hell.  This IS a hole in the wall so don't expect a few tables, silverware and a waiter. Service is great, food is tasty and the prices are just right. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed every sandwich I've tried at Mister Brisket. As far as sandwich spots in Cleveland, I would put them as a distant second to Slyman's. They are definitely worth a visit. A very old school feel with quality food."}
{"text":"3.5*, which is pretty decent coming from me for this type of food.  I've been to Katz in NYC, I've been to S*** here in Cleveland, I've been to Montreal.  I keep thinking that I'll love pastrami, and it never really seems quite right.  I went a a Sat early afternoon (maybe 12:30-ish) and I was the only one there, served right away!  PROS: very affordable, super friendly staff, easy/fast take out, you can try a slice of pastrami/corned beef/brisket to see what you want before you order, the sides are also delicious (I got the potato salad), good size, the lunch meal comes with a drink and a pickle  CONS: very fatty, bread was unimpressive  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Mister Brisket is my sandwich mistress on the east side.  Certainly don't introduce her to your lady during a date, but on a lonely afternoon, there's really no better sandwich in town.  One really must forgive their lack of indoor seating and run down interior, and look through to the meaty goodness within.  Mister Brisket has the best pastrami in Cleveland, hands down.  Watching each individual piece being sliced from a smoking hot hunk of seasoned beef is honestly a religious experience.  Their meats are tender, juicy, and incredibly flavorful.  The employees craft sandwiches such that the meat is able to speak for itself, never hidden away behind piles of veggies or condiments.  It's not the cheapest lunch, with $8 being standard for a sandwich, but the quality most certainly makes up for the price.  I honestly think that the Melt across the street could learn a thing or two from these meaty sandwich artisans.     Do yourself a favor and stop in if you haven't yet, absolutely worth your time and money."}
