{"text":"My mother and I were driving around last year looking for something to eat and absolutely unable to agree on anything when we saw Am's Thai Tokyo humbly sitting on the corner across from the carniceria in its non-descript white building. I've since been back a couple of times, so I've had a good sampling of their wares.

The summer rolls (fresh spring rolls) are up to par, but what makes them special is the amazing peanut sauce they serve on the side. Main dishes begin with a bowl of soothing chicken and rice soup with bits of onion and cilantro floating on top. Noodles are made in house for entrees. You'll notice that they're irregularly cut and have a slightly chewy texture. The curries aren't mixed from paste and from what I gathered from one of the servers their herbs are grown in a backyard garden.

Sadly, I haven't had an opportunity to order a hot pot from them, but I did notice families and small groups coming in expressly for that reason and really hope to do so myself next time. 

My personal favorite of theirs has been the larb nam tok: marinated grilled and seasoned beef served on a bed of lettuce. Savory, a little vinegary and delicious. Great on hot days when you want a cool, but still satisfying dish. 

The only complaint I'd lodge is that they don't necessarily ask you about how spicy you'd like a dish, but you can always request the chile tray to add some extra!"}

Get the egg rolls.  You will not be disappointed.  I even got an order to take home with me because of how good they are.

Also, if they have their dumplings - get them as well.  Yummy!

Everything is fresh and made to order.  It's amazing food with great service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten there twice this week.  It's right off Hwy 29 (N Cannon Blvd).  We've had the Phad Thai, Pha Nang with Seafood, Hibachi Chicken, & Hibachi Steak.  ALL HAVE EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS.

The food and staff are off the charts!"}
{"text":"Welcome back, Am!  I was crushed when you closed your retaurant many years ago and thrilled that you are open once again with your superior offernings.  Ate lunch there today and was just as impressed as ever!!!"}
