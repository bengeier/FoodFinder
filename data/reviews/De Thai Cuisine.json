{"text":"Excellent Thai food. This restaurant has become one of our favourites."}
{"text":"Ordered drunken noodles and the Thai Dumplings. Dumplings were tasty with nice garlic & spice, but $8 for 4 tiny dumplings was a bit much. The drunken noodles had some kick, but the abundance of baby corn, celery, & carrots was a BIG disappointment. How about some peppers? Underwhelmed and overpriced"}
{"text":"Wow, the Pad Thai is the best we have had in Canada. That being said. The portions were a bit small for sharing, but suitable for an individual. The presentation of each dish was second to none. If you admire French cuisine for it's visual appeal, you will appreciate the extra effort here. The other dishes including ,Chicken( a little light on the basil) and rice dishes were very good, but not outstanding. The 5 star dish here is the Pad Thai. If you have room for desert(which you will with the smaller portions), try the Roti. It is as good as you find on the streets of Bangkok. If you live close to Marda Loop, you need to try this place,   A quick mention on the décor, it is fresh(like the food) and simple and elegant. he place is well lit and comfortable.   Oh, if I forgot to mention is, you have to try the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"So yummy! I love the papaya salad and gone drunken noodles. Great service and friendly staff. And delicious food. It's never too busy, easy to walk in and get a table. Really clean."}
{"text":"Convenience at a price.  De Thai is located in the heart of Marda Loop, which offers free parking and proximity for those of us fortunate enough to live nearby.  However, being the only Thai restaurant around, the menu is a bit pricier than most.  Chicken satay...3 stars.  A decent offering but not worth $12.  The chicken is fried rather than grilled but was still cooked well.  The meat was a bit over seasoned, though...I could taste the saltiness even through the peanut sauce.  The peanut sauce was also just decent, nothing special...some folks may like the bits of peanut in the sauce but I didn't care for it.  The accompanying vinaigrette was more or less eye candy as the skewers were covered in the stronger tasting peanut sauce. Overall, this was an average dish.    Spring rolls...4 stars.  Very good rolls.  Perfectly cooked; golden brown and crispy.  The problem with small rolls is the limited filling, so you end up enjoying just the fried wrapper.  Pad Thai (chicken)...4 stars.  Nice and light.  The noodles are lightly coated in the peanut tamarind sauce.  The sauce is used sparingly and doesn't drown the dish.  It also has good color but could use a bit more flavor.  The dish could use a bit more chicken, as well.  Larb (chicken)...2 stars.  All the right flavors are there (lime juice, chili peppers, lemon grass, scallions, cilantro, fish sauce and bile for that traditional bitter taste) but the protein killed the dish.  Using and sautéing minched chicken breast only made the dish taste very dry.  The sauce, itself, is already very rustic and adding dry meat only makes it worse.  Boiled/baked and shredded dark and light meat would've given this dish 5 stars.  The tender boiled meat would balance the sauce out.  Perhaps I'll have to try beef next time.  I requested lettuce leaves but the dish is usually enjoyed with sticky rice.  Red curry (chicken)...4 stars.  A decent offering.  The sauce has good consistency, color, and flavor.  Kind of strange to see zucchini, but then again, you could add almost any vegetable to curry dishes."}
{"text":"Really good food! Not quite a 5-star because the lighting/atmosphere could use an upgrade. But if you want some fast, quick, good Thai food - go here (and maybe don't order the calamari)"}
{"text":"Just finished a fabulous dinner here! Spring rolls were awesome, Tom kha soup was extremely flavorful and the drunken noodles were fantastic. I suggest no more then two chilies if you like spice but aren't a pro!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with my pup looking for some quick take-out to bring home when I came across De Thai.  It's situated on the main strip of Marda Loop and has a convenient parking lot out back - if you can grab a spot!  The lunch menu was awesome!  Great price and great value for the portions.  It's just enough for lunch time.  I ordered the pad thai noodles and the pad-tew (beef w/peanut sauce and zucchini).  Both were awesome!  Great flavour and the pad thai was not a bright red which is great!  Their spring rolls were also nice and great when they are really crispy and thin.  The restaurant was not busy at the time but I hear it is quite busy for dinner.  I will be back to try them out!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 2 because of the service and speed of delivery.  Otherwise, I would give it a Zero.  The food was not hot and was completely tasteless.  I've been eating Thai food all over Canada for over 50 years, and this was not the worst, but close to it.  We shared the salad rolls, chicken satay and chicken pad thai.  The salad rolls were fine.  Chicken satay - the chicken was white and cold, and there was a very chunky peanut sauce on the side.  The pad thai was mostly bean sprouts (chew, chew, chew) and the noodles were so thin and mainly non-existent.  The sauce was bland and boring.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. A little on the expensive side, but the food quality is as good as it gets for Thai food in Calgary. I prefer this Thai restaurant to some of the top ranked ones in the city."}
