{"text":"The homemade burger is really good. The normal burger is average. The fries is nothing special. I took off one star for their price range. The homemade burger combo is around 12 bucks. The other star is because their normal burger doesn't taste that good."}
{"text":"Tried the all stars burger and it was amazing! Freshly grilled with a variety of condiments to choose from. Only wish the buns we're toasted a little more. Going to try the Kaiser next time!"}
{"text":"Love how they kept the look and the vibes so authentic. Best burger in Thornhill.
The burgers are amazing, but the fries could use some umph."}
{"text":"if you like burgers, you're going to like this place as long as you order the \"All Star Burger\". I've been going to Golden Star for more than five years now. The All Star burger is tender and juicy, and always done to a a perfect medium well right in front of your eyes. Also make sure you top it with their homemade BBQ sauce. 

This is a family run business, and if you get lucky  you may run into the hilarious owner who will sing for you while you wait for your burger. What's more is that since they are licensed, you can enjoy a nice cold beer with your burger which makes the experience even better without having to have to pay through your nose.

Bottom line... highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic, there's not much more to say than what's been said.  I'll restate that it's all about the All-Star Burger.  As far as the staff being indifferent, it's a burger joint, there are no waiters, everyone's behind the counter, it's what it is."}
{"text":"Suffers from a fatal flaw that afflicts far too many burger joints: nasty fries. Short and stubby (how does that happen?), limp, soggy and greasy. Come on boys, bring your deep fryer up to temperature or something and give me some crunch. The burger is decent (make sure you order the CORRECT type of patty -- don't get the small thin one), but I don't go very often on account of inferior fries."}
{"text":"Reliably good fast eats. Generous portions. A recommended landmark and a worthy place to have a grilled to order burgers, dog, chicken, steak, fish, or veggie burger. Inside could use some updating, but it's functional and clean and does the job."}
{"text":"This is your classic burger joint with a no frills and old school decor. It actually reminds me of Harveys back in the early 90's. 
My friend has talked about this place for some time now so I decided to check it out with him.
I had the house special which is the Homemade All Star Burger: 6 oz of 100% pure beef juicy goodness. Loved it and makes me sad to think of wasted beef in McD's burgers. 
Anyway, toppings - the usual suspects and I had them all less the mayo. The burger held together better than I expected (though I tend not to put it down when I start eating in the anticipation that it'll fall apart).  Delicious. What a real burger should taste like."}
{"text":"Best Veggie burger of life! Straight up till I die. This place is like your classic burger joint, everything down to the décor is an absolute beauty. the Fries and onion rings are really tasty too. It's a little expensive here but well well worth it. My boyfriends first time here, he was so impressed that he immediately set up a yelp account to review it (still trying to find that review haha)"}
{"text":"I had heard legends about this place prior to finally making a visit...only to be thwarted by a \"Cash Only\" sign, prompting me to make a walk down to a bank down the street (say no to ATM fees).

When I finally got to Golden Star, I was pleasantly surprised by all the happy and friendly staff. I tend to associate burger joints with high school kids being paid minimum wage, grumpy, attitudey, etc.

When I got to the condiments, I stood there slack-jawed, trying to decide what toppings I'd like on my burger, but the guy was friendly and patient while I made my choices.

Unfortunately, I made a mistake and ordered a regular burger instead of the all-star burger. I took a bite of Boyfriend's All-star burger, and it was definitely more flavourful, but the regular burger was still delicious. The patties are rather thin, which surprised me, but I guess that's why Hero burgers seem cardboard-y to me.

The meal didn't seem huge, after all, it's just a regular sized burger...but word to the wise, don't operate heavy machinery after dining at Golden Star! I took a 2 hour nap after getting home, and I didn't feel hunger for over 24 hours after the burger

Thing to note:
beverage is small. not sure if they offer refills, didn't ask."}
{"text":"Best homeade burger in GTA.  Get the homemade burger or nothing. Regular burger is just a frozen patty.  Fries are average.  Ask for them well done."}

{"text":"Quite literally the finest burger that I've eaten, as far as I can remember. I had the 12 oz. MVP Burger with all the trimmings-- a true gastronomic epiphany. Be sure to get the sauteed onions!

A little on the pricy side, but you do get a rather healthy helping of fresh, high quality beef, grilled before your very eyes, so it's *well* worth it!"}
{"text":"A Thornhill establishment and multiple best of the city winner, although I'm not sure why. If you're looking for a boxed burger on a not so good bun then this is your place, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Harvey's in terms of food and operation. 

We ordered 2 home burgers, one fries, onion rings and a gravy. Total came to approximate $30.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Honestly. I do not understand what the big fuss is about over this place.
Friends of mine used to say ``its the best burger around here!``..so the first time I went with my boyfriend, the service was just awful..when I was asking for the toppings on my burger, the cook stated ``what else???..as though I was giving him so many issues for asking for lettuce, tomato and ketchup..no smiles, no thank you just here you go..we tried it and honestly, there was nothing that special about it..the burger was like any other burger people can grill at home..fries were eh but this place is nothing to write home about...this was of course 5 years ago..
Recently, we were around the neighborhood and thought, hey maybe they had an off day and maybe its changed 5 years later..we decided to give it another try.
BIG MISTAKE!
Every staff member there looked like they wanted to be anywhere else but there..the girl at the front mumbled our order and everyone seriously looked like they could give a rats ass about customer service..I get it, sometimes people have bad days, but come on..way to go downhill all the way with all your staff..and honestly, for the price of your combo..its not worth it AT ALL!

I do not recommend this place at all! Drive a little further north to Steer Inn Burger...at least their food is worth it and their staff are funny and welcoming!
Golden star..I do not care if your a family run business..maybe you all need to re-structure what it means to first) make a good burger, and second) provide at least adequate customer service."}

It's so good definitely go there"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.

People love Golden Star. For some reason, the burgers and shakes at this shack excite consumers like funnel cakes at Canada's Wonderland. What's the appeal? I think it's a combination of nostalgia, uniqueness, authenticity, and fat.

Whatever the case, this place delivers an old-fashioned off-the-grill meal that will satisfy anyone looking for a burger + fries + milkshake lunch the way your daddy used to order.

The milkshakes are quite tasty. The menu is filled with salt, fat, and cholesterol, so of course it tastes good. You can't go wrong, really.

3 stars"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Childhood memories galore and always delivers on exactly what that big yellow sign promises...delicious burger, diner style fries and friendly service. I probably end up back in Thornhill once a year and when I do, I find my way to Golden Star. Such a treat. This time, the Leafs were playing and obviously they've got it on. Make sure to spend the extra couple loonies and get the homemade burger, you know, because it's homemade. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So i heard a lot of good things about this place and thought that I would give it a try.

Well for sure the A-Star burger they had was GREAT!! the Fries were very AVG and the drink was Small. Overall the combo will fill u up for sure coz the burgers are huge, a bit bigger the the Whopper u get in Burger King! 

However everything is good except for the price, maybe it used to be cheaper when it was less known, but $12.50 for a combo isn't worth it i thought, but still good to give it a first try."}
{"text":"The owners are a blast. Not sure his name but he rhymes, riddles and jokes!! Good vibes!!

Lets not forget that the food rocks!!! Burgers are the best, no exaggeration. Go for the home made burger. 

Only one weird thing.... The BBQ sauce is not like any BBQ sauce I ever had.

5 Stars to Golden Star!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Burgers in TOWNN!
Deff recommend it.
a bit too pricey but veryy yummyy"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times in the last 15+ years and everything is still about the same. Burgers here are pretty good but nothing special, definitely not enough to warrant 5 stars. It is better than burgers from fast food establishments but in my opinion does not come close to burger priest and other gourmet burger restaurants. Downside is that it is still cash only, you would think that  after all these years they would take debit/credit."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking...another dang burger review?! 

The debate on best burgers has become an essential topic of conversation with any real foodie but as much as it's been discussed, there never seems to be a clear victor.  Because of that reason, I may be using some restaurants to compare during my review to ensure that this is an accessible review to everyone. (ie. Saying their onion rings is crispy and tasty is too vague, but saying their onion rings are similar to the ones at Harveys may allow you to associate how it actually would taste because I'm pretty sure its safe to assume that most people reading this have been to a franchise like Harveys...right?) Hmm...after editing my review a bit, I think most of my comparison will be to Harveys.  I'm not saying they're in the same league though.

Everyone has their own tastes and rules s when it comes to these tasty delights in a bun so before you read further, here are mine:

1) Thy Burger shall not fall apart - I HATE it when the burger(not the meat, the sandwich as a whole) starts to rip apart/leak profusely/condiments fall out.
2) Thy Burger shall not be messy - I guess this goes hand in hand with my first rule.  If a burger is able to stay together and not fall apart, then it's safe to say it won't be a messy burger
3) Thy Burger Condiments shall not be so overwhelming as to mask the taste of the patty itself - If I can hardly taste the meat, might as well get a regular sandwich.

Those are simple preferences that I've set for myself when gauging a good burger.  There is never one sure fire answer for each.  (ie. A burger that won't fall apart can have a solid bun to surface area to contain all the meat and condiments, but another option would be to present the burger tightly wrapped up for gripping and eating.

So finally..on to the review:

Décor:
This is like a trucker stop diner to me. Maybe a borderline greasy spoon because there are a lot of regulars here too.  This restaurant apparently has been around since the 60s and I'm sure they've made some renovations over that course of time but definitely not recently.  This place is great as a casual hang out to eat with friends or maybe have a date if the other person appreciates food and trying new things.  
It's a place where you can just as easily do take out or dine in.

Food:
You don't come to this place for the ambiance, you come for the food straight up.  I've heard about their homemade burger and how even though it is a bit more flat, the texture and taste is fantastic so I went for that and split a Banquet burger as well (bacon and cheese). I'm happy to report that it did live up to it's expectations! The meat was tender and juicy even if it was thinner than most burgers out there.  Typically condiments aren't really talked about but the bacon that they put in the banquet burger was super thick and really complimented the burger meat without completely overpowering it.  The bun itself was average (toasted and soft) but it was good enough to prevent the burger from falling apart.  The burger was just right in my opinion but imagine if it were thicker with the same texture and taste!? Wow.  If you want to compare burger meats, this one is similar to Johnny's Charbroiled Burgers on Victoria Park and Sheppard.

The sides were so so. Like said before, I'll make comparisons and the onion rings and fries here are very similar to those of Harveys so don't expect too much in this department.  Though they really do pack it in..meaning they put so many fries and onion rings in each box.

Service:
If you're not rude to me and instead just friendly and courteous, I couldn't care less about it at these types of restaurants.  Thankfully, the cashier was friendly and that's all I needed. The restaurant setup is similar to that of Harveys where you order from the cashier first and then get your condiments on your bun and then go sit down.

Overall:
This is a great diner to mozy on over to get a tasty but not too filling burger (just don't gorge on the sides).  I would definitely go again because the first time I went, I did do take out so I wasn't able to fully experience the burger at its hottest and I guess \"freshest\".  I've been to many burger joints but there are still some that have eluded me: Burger's Priest, Prime Burger, Apache.  This place is not the best I've ever had in my opinion though.  I actually quite enjoy Johnny Rockets or burgers from M&M Meatshops....I know I know, most of you probably think I'm stupid but when I give you my review and reasoning behind it, you'll understand how it correlates to my Commandments of a good burger."}
{"text":"This is one of those beat up old-school burger joints.
Don't be fooled by it's appearance. The burgers here are BOMB!
Do you eat Johnny's Burgers for breakfast, lunch and dinner? Yes? You'd love Golden Star!
Friendly staff and amazing food.

They need to spend some money on renovations, that's all."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed on a recently visit and being my first time there.  Ordered the home burger, fries with gravy and drink.  The burger was raw in one area and the toppings were not generous at all.  The drink wasn't even filled to the top.  Was not worth the $13.55.  However the gravy for the fries was really good!

My friend had the wings...I should have ordered that, they were good!"}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place and it's always looked busy, so I decide to try it for lunch the other day. The customer service was great as everyone was friendly and you get to watch them cook your food. Didn't know they don't take credit or debit till it was time to pay but they do have an atm on site. Price was reasonable for the amount of food we got and for the quality of food. In all we left feeling satisfied and full!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, old school fries and onion rings. We got the homemade all star burgers!! Portions are huge!! Just make sure you bring cash! No \"plastics\" are accepted. But they do have an ATM in case your stuck. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"\"The one with all the flying napkins.\"

The Good:
Burger was large; fast service; quality was OK (I'd say on the level of Wendy's which is funny, see below)

The Bad:
Place looked like it came from the 1970's; beef was a little dry; combo was definitely not worth it

Overview:
Went there today with co-workers for lunch. We got in our car debating where to go and we were this close to going to a simple Wendy's but one of them really had a hankering for some good meat so we drove a little further for what they promised to be \"the best burgers ever\".

The place itself looked like it hadn't been renovated since 1970s, but I didn't mind (since I was there for the food after all!) We ended up each getting the All-Star burger (they explained how the different burgers came from fresh and even more fresh beef but I can't remember what was what, only that this was the \"freshest\") combo, which came out to $9.82 after taxes. If I'd known what the combo included, I probably would have just gotten the burger since that was less than $6 before tax. The combo just added some taste-less fries and some pop from concentrated syrup.

The burger was massive (bun was definitely not large enough for the burger!) and I had \"the works\" for toppings. Maybe it's just me, but I felt the meat to be a little dry compared to others that I've had and tasteless. I can't imagine how dry it would've been if you don't get toppings (I had the works), but make sure you grab tons of napkins if you do cause things are gonna get messy! Toppings were all falling off for everyone and luckily I grabbed a handful before we went out and sat down on the patio...it got windy though so make sure you hold your napkins (=. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it and we were all debating about how this was the BEST burger ever.  In my opinion, think Hero Burgers are better - they're juicier and taste meatier.

Overall, it's OK but the combo was definitely not worth it (most of us agreed on this). I might get the burger again next time but most likely will try their \"Hot Dog Surprise\" (can't remember what it was but he explained it to me...something about melted cheese and bacon I think?)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite mom and pop greasy spoon burger spot. I have been going here since high school.

I recommend eating there as the fries and burger get soggy fast.

onion rings are good, fries are good, and my favourite burger is the all star burger which is made there each day."}
{"text":"Found this place through Instagram one night with a buddy while craving burgers.

It reminds me of Johnny Burgers in Scarborough.  Food was OK.  Burger was cooked nicely and toppings were your basic traditional toppings.  Poutine gravy was canned gravy but considering I don't mind canned gravy it appealed to me.  Real cheese curds on the poutine which was nice.  Fries a little soft inside.

Had a chocolate shake which was the worst shake I've ever had.  It was icy as if the ice cream was freezer burnt which didn't make it creamy but chunky and like a chocolate icee.  Would not get this again.

Does not accept debit or credit which in this day and age I feel is a bit of a boon.  Why not accept this other then to make money off people who need to use their ATM.  They had a modern POS so it's not like it couldn't be integrated.  Also the male employee who was not in uniform like everyone else, perhaps the owner was not very friendly or jovial with the customers.

All in all I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"try their star burgers (a.k.a. home burger...yum!! fries are also good. bring cash--- no debit, no credit, no dice.  they do have an atm--1.25 charge :(:(:(:(:("}
{"text":"Burgers how they were meant to be made! Before walking  into this place I could smell the charbroiled goodness from the parking lot.  The restaurant itself has a retro vibe and feel. Burgers are prepared on a flame broiled grill in front of you...reminded me a lot of Harvey's when Harvey's used to be good but this is by far better.

Had the Allstar burger with fries and a side of gravy. The burger was a 6oz homemade fresh all beef patty! Solid bun to meat ratio, and one of the best tasting burgers in the GTA. Fries were crispy nothing amazing but good enough as the burger is the star at this place.  The gravy was great really elevated the fries. 

Been here a handful of times and never walked away disappointed. Service is great its a family owned business. Prices are a little high but the quality of thier food reflects that."}
{"text":"Their Home made burger is the best in town. Quality has been consistent in the past 7 years that I've become a regular customer. Overall my top 2 in burgers within the GTA. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. It has been open forever. Family run business. Reasonably priced and good portions. If you are going...order nothing else but the Homemade with fries. The burger to bun ratio is perfect. Not shy on toppings. Fries compliment the burger nicely. Gravy is dirty..... which makes the fries even better. Decor hasn't changed and  gives that retro feel. Say hello to the picture on the wall of the Godfather for me."}
{"text":"This place is about 10 minute drive from my home.
This is our new alternative to the cheaper and greasier Pizza-Pizza and McDonald's. 

A family run business (which we should all support) with super tasty burgers and sweet potato fries. I always order Home Burger and s.p.fries.

Highly recommended. They only accept CASH (a 3rd-party ATM m/c in on the premises if you don't mind paying a fee for cash withdraw)."}
{"text":"This place needs to be updated, but honestly the best burger place in my opinion.  I have tried Johnny's, The Burger's Priest, Five Guys, Fresh Burger, Big Boys Burgers... etc.  and this place is on top of my list.  Good parking and free wifi as well. CASH only is the downside."}
{"text":"Great local burger joint that has been around since I can remember. They're 2nd generation family run and are known for their all star homemade burgers. 

Very reminiscent of Harvey's sans the chain.

 Keeps the old school diner feel alive but upgraded to 2.0 with the LLBO stamp of approval; that means beer with your burgers boys

Super cool manager who took care of me and my gf really well; he didn't charge for cheese or her milkshake. 

Just a great vibe when you walk in and the burgers are juicy and big. The fries portions are huge too."}
{"text":"now here is a place to recommend to your friends (but don't over recommend as I don't want to wait in long lines).

so continuing with my burger joint review:

I have been here probably 10-15 times total, so safe to say it is on my 'safe\" list to satisfy the craving.

what I had: I usually have the all star burger here, as always with bacon and sauteed onions, as at all burger places so that I have a comparable burger base, so I am comparing apples to apples among restaurants. I added pickles, tomato, lettuce, onion, ketchup, home made sauce.

analysis: So overall, the product is quite good, and deserving of a 4 start rating. all in, ibut over and above, I think it is the best value by a wide margin in the city so it is a 5 star place. the reason being is that the burgers are delicious, the quality is consistent from day to day, and the price is unbeatable.

1. service: service was ok, as always. they are friendly, and the brothers in the joint are sort of dorky, but nice guys. some servers have attitude, but most are still ok.

2. price: around 13$, which is I great, considering this is a combo price, and i also got bacon which is extra.

3. taste: the bun is good, adequate amount of crisp (although depends on who makes it, can be hit or miss). patties are very good, fresh flavourful, juicy, never spongy. so over all as you bite into this thing, it is the perfect concoction of flavour, texture, fresshness, and juice, all of which make it killer tasting.

the fries are very good, best part is the type of grainy ketchup that they use, which is hunts I believe? but it is very very good (although I know it is quite subjective but its tastes superior to anything else I have had, even better than beer beestro fries. 

4. portion size- I find it on the high medium, not quite large, size. which is a plus.

yes the place is rundown, but thats a part of the atmosphere, ok?

I havent been to marben or stock yards, but right now golden star is the run away joint, for which i sometimes drive 100km to! 

go and get a burger there.. shouldn't be a disappointment 

PS try a black cherry milkshake"}
{"text":"This old diner is hidden with all the modern buildings that I pass by it many times and didn't even notice it.  I was recommeded by my friend so I gave it a try.  The place itself is old and the seating is uncomfortable.  The burger itself is very good and the portion of fries they give you is plentiful served to you in a green bin.  The onion rings are good as well.  I got the banquet buger and fries while my gf got the allstar burger and onion rings.  Beef was juicy and texture was great and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  They cook everything right in front of your eyes as well.  The pricing wasn't so bad either around $10 a person.   Only bad thing is the small parking lot and the cash only."}
{"text":"My current pick for the best burger joint in Toronto. 
Go for the homemade burger with cheese. The patty is amazing, juicy and tender. Add some mayo as a topping and it feels like its melting in your mouth. It's big and filling and this alone would make it worth the trip, but the fries are also pretty great too. Usually better when they're done a little longer (ask if you want) they are thick cut and crispy. Portions are very large, so don't expect to be hungry for dinner if you've eaten lunch here. :)
Annoyingly, the price keeps on climbing ever higher. Over 25 bucks for 2 people to have burgers is getting a bit much and turns this into an even more occasional visit. Also, a minor complaint: the drink with the combo is tiny for some reason (equivalent of a small most places). Especially for the price you pay (over 10 dollars)...c'mon drinks are cheap on your end I'm sure.
The decor is really dated, but honestly this is a family place that has been around forever so it sort of adds to the charm: wood pannelling all over the place, bright orange booths, worn countertops, photos of the owner, the same staff as long as I've been going, and all. There's a reason the place has been open so long that the decor look like this: because of the food.
If you're in the north end of the city it's more than worth the visit to this super cool classic family run burger joint."}
{"text":"Another old classic that has stood the test of time. Three generations of family have kept this Thornhill landmark going strong. The service is great, beer is cheap and the homemade burger puts just about every chain to shame. Toppings are fresh and if you are lucky enough to see the original owners son, he'll recite the classic lines of 'Golden Star it's the best by far, you can get there by car........' As the flames from the grill leap up a good foot and a half or so. 

The decor is probably mostly original from it's opening in 1964, where Yonge St was a drag race haven for old muscle cars in what was a much more rural Thornhill. Now stuck between a massive condo development and a crappy used car dealer it's still an iconic burger joint and not just for the trip down memory lane."}
{"text":"My all-time favourite burger in the city. No matter where I travel, I always end up comparing a burger I try elsewhere to a Golden Star burger. The homemade is the only way to go at Golden Star; juicy burgers cooked on a grill by staff who have been there since I was a kid. Service is always fast and friendly. Decor hasn't changed in years, and likely isn't going to change. Fine by me, but it would be nice if one day they started taking credit cards. For now, as it has always been, cash only. 

I usually ask for my fries well-done. As the fries are thicker cut fries, I find that sometimes when Golden Star is busy, the fries tend to get undercooked. Some friends enjoy the less-done fries, so I guess it is just a personal preference. 

The grape drink is a classic and a must have! Don't forget... they have great BBQ sauce and fried onions to top off their burgers."}
{"text":"I ordered the All Star Burger with bacon, cheese, and mushroom (additional fee for each). I also had a strawberry milkshake and some onion rings.

The burger was great, I didn't ask too much add ons like lettuce and pepper as I knew it would get too messy when I take a bite. I opted for tomato, pickles, cooked onions, and barbecue sauce. Even then, I took out some of the tomatoes later on. I liked the combination I ended up with, the bacon gave a welcome crunch to the soft buns and moist burger patty. I haven't had a proper burger in a long time and this was a great experience to reintroduce me to the meal.

The onion rings were okay, nothing spectacular. I didn't get to finish everything because the quality went down when they turned cold. The milkshake was surprisingly good. My issue was they put it in a coke disposable cup with the plastic lid and all. I was expecting it to be served on a traditional milkshake cup, since everything else in the place is giving off that vibe.

I'm trying to eat more healthily but I'll definitely go back for the burger, against my better judgement."}
{"text":"Over priced, small drinks, no debit, long lines.....not close to other fresh burger joints. Good spot for the dealerships across the strretthat have short lunch breaks but wouldn't go out of my way. Fries are horrible."}
{"text":"The all star burger is pretty good. It is by no means the best burger that I've had, but at $7.5 is fairly priced. I liked the beef, and there were quite a lot of other things added. I must add though that it's not huge... I was pretty hungry after I finished it (although that was after a workout), and I ended up eating a lot of fries (there goes the workout). 

So why only 3 stars?
-the combo is expensive. Granted you get a lot of fries, but over $10 is too much for a diner like this place. The fries can easily feed more than 2 people... it'd be better if they gave a smaller fries serving and reduced the price of the combo by at least $2. Also the drink size is quite small. 
-the beef in the other burgers is pretty bad. I took a bite of my son's burger, and the meat tasted worse than Mcdonalds.  

There is a fairly decent size parking lot. I may return, but mainly for the burger. If I did return, I'd probably share one serving of fries between  at least 3 people for better value/ health"}
{"text":"Typical non franchise burger place. It's been around for over 50 years. Place doesn't take credit or debit but they have an atm on site."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the best old-school charburger joints in the city, similar to Burger Shack and Real McCoy's and MUCH better than Johnny's and Apache.

OUTSTANDING fries, GREAT homeburgers, decent onion rings, crappy shakes but in a bunch of interesting flavours, and (sorry previous reviewer) truly awful from-a-cheap-powdered-mix gravy!  I do however agree with another previous reviewer and ask for my burger bun to be double-toasted in the conveyor toaster.

In fact, the only thing preventing me from declaring Golden Star the king of drive-in style burgerdom is the truly horrid gravy that is not only made from a crappy powdered cornstarch mix, but strangely then pre-portioned into dozens of tiny styrofoam cups and is just sitting around under a heat lamp waiting to be ordered!! 

Well, that and the halfway-decent, but unfortunately frozen onion rings instead of the amazing hand-battered killers at Burger Shack and Real McCoy's.

ON THE OTHER HAND, Golden Star has amazing homemade burgers (ahem - with extra/double/triple toppings yours for the asking) and really really great fresh-cut fries, which make Golden Star a can't miss choice for a great drive-in charburger.

Cheers
.James."}
{"text":"Old school in the best way possible! Been going to Golden Star for years now and I have to say its my favorite burger joint in the city! Forget all those pretentious and expensive burger restaurants.. If you enjoy good burgers, fries, steak sandwiches try Golden Star! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want to eat a burger that isn't wrapped or in a box and comes with fries or crappy breaded onion rings...

Golden Star exceeds what I am looking for when I just want a burger that's real and fulfilling of my craving! What I really like more than the burgers themselves is the onion rings. Fresh and battered, not breaded, crispy, golden and goes great with the BBQ sauce. Best of all, when you are finished, you don't feel sick or like you've eaten something that you're going to regret.

4-stars only because the price point is a little more than you'd expect, but at the same time, you get what you pay for...

Check them out sometime..."}
{"text":"I always like when simple foods are cooked really well . This is a simple and authentic burger joint. I came here with a party of 6. You order from the menu at the front and pay. Then you watch them cook the meat right in front of you and when your burger is ready, you can dress it how you like. It's a simple concept with a basic menu but their food is cooked to perfection and super tasty.

We ordered the hot dog, a couple hamburgers, and a couple steak burgers with fries. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, I asked for debit, they said cash only, when I said your still in the Stone Age. The comment that I got was if it's not broken why fix it . Really. People are force to use their ATM machine."}
{"text":"I've lived in Edmonton for 27 years, home
For a visit and we decided to try Golden Star since I haven't eaten there since moving out West. It's still an amazing spot. Burger was how I remembered it and the poutine you won't regret! People were friendly, and the owner and his son were so welcoming and friendly! We need one in Edmonton!!! We will be back again before heading home to Edmonton. A lot of reminiscing from my highschool days!"}
{"text":"Average burger, subpar onion rings. Ordered the homemade patty, but wasn't able to tell a big difference compared to a fast-food chain burger. The person putting the burger was friendly. Come here for the rustic feels and expect less of the burgers."}
{"text":"This is your quintessential old school burger joint. Anyone that grew up or lives in Thornhill has fond memories of frequenting this establishment after a late night partying with friends. I never imagined 20 years ago that I would now be bringing my children here to cure their burger cravings. The burgers and fries are still delicious and the 1970s style orange booths are still in the restaurant as I remember them. The poutine and onion rings are also very tasty but be prepared to leave feeling pretty full if you order these as sides with your burger. It's hard not to devour everything because it's that good. I highly recommend this place for a quick and delicious burger meal in a retro burger joint atmosphere."}
{"text":"No question about it, my favourite place for a great burger in the GTA.  Their All-Star burger is a juicy, freshly made homemade patty.  When I say homemade, I mean homemade.  They create the patty on premises.  The french fries are freshly cut on premises as well.  You can see the prep area in the back with the large bags of potatoes being peeled.  I haven't had their regular burger in years (I think it's an ordinary frozen patty) but why would I change?  The All-Star burger is the way to go with an order of fresh cut fries.  The onion rings are okay as well.  Frozen, not homemade, but passable none the less.  The owners Joe & Frank have taken over for the founder Frank Sr who you can see there from time to time.  It's a family run affair as Joe & Frank Jr have their kids slowly taking over and keeping up with the great food.  Great milkshakes as well.  Cash only, but an ATM is available and usually working."}
{"text":"TBH....when it comes to QUALITY burger...this joint is one of the revolutionary....with the old fashioned deli atmosphere....i love their patties are soft and juicy and the way they melt the cheese on top is amazing...MUST GO for burger enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, perfectly cooked, fries and onion rings are always so delicious, it takes me forever to choose between the two. Not really on the completely cheap side, but affordable. Amazing burgers. Would defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was gr8. Would bang again. Much sex, wow. Only negative is that they have bad jokes. There are no umbrellas in december."}
{"text":"First time here, all this Yelp drama about a specific burger joint is making me crave burgers all day everyday!

I can't believe how I missed this place considering that it's near my area and that they've got a massive sign with a shiny golden star. Anyways I walked in and staff were very welcoming. He recommended me their all star burger which is a never frozen, 6oz homemade patty pressed and prepared fresh to order, Included toppings reminds me of Harvey's good ol' toppings. For a little extra you can add bacon, cheese, an egg, or mushrooms. Overall it was juicy and fresh.

I sure liked their burger. Next time I might try their 12oz MVP burger."}
{"text":"Great old school spot.  Excellent burger and fries.  Clean place, super fast to order and they cook in front of you.  Love the burgers and fries, gravy is ok."}
{"text":"With all the modern burger joints opening up, this one stays in the top 10 while making the same burger that they made decades ago.  

Always get the home made burger, it's tender with strong garlic taste.  Fries are great too, but you may only need one order if your with someone.

Staff are always chatty and no matter how busy it is the line moves and they never mess up your order."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant as I was looking for a burger joint near my home. I have to say I am very happy that I found it. 

The burger patty and steak are big and juicy. Onion rings are really tasty. On top of that the service is very friendly. The dining environment is nice too. They always have ball games playing on TV and beer is offered here too.

Like other reviews mentioned, they only take cash so please bring your own. The only snag here i think is that the restaurant is located on yonge but outside the subway zone and a bit of walking distance from steeles. It is best to drive here.

Still this is a great burger joint. Will come here again and again."}
{"text":"This burger joint is located just north of of the official border of \"Toronto\", at Yonge and Steeles. It has a very cute diner exterior and interior look to it. Fast food style where you line up and place your order then find your own seat and throw out your own garbage after.

The five stars are for their amazing burgers and fries. I like Burgers Priest. I like Holy Chucks. But maybe I like this more, given the quality of the burger and speed they make it, not to mention prices are better here too. They also don't give flimsy buns. Comes with sesame seeds and still a great messy delicious burger.

A hidden gem, since you tend to drive past it, but they have their regulars coming here to fill it up.

The homemade all star burger is where it's at. A 6 oz burger for under $8 compared to a smaller burgers priest specialty burger for over $10. Fries were fresh and thick cut."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a burger for lunch. In terms of overall atmosphere, it had a traditional diner type of feel. It is a bit like Harvey's as the other reviewers mentioned in that you get to choose your toppings. 

I got the all star burger 6 oz with an addition of bacon and cheese. The burger was pretty good overall but didn't think the bacon added too much. I wouldn't recommend adding it. The 6 oz was good enough to fill me up but there is an option to try the larger 12 oz burger.

There is free parking in the back and they do appear to serge alcohol as well as there is a bar in the restaurant. They don't take credit card so bring cash. Overall, I would return if I happened to be in the area but would probably not actively seek it out."}
{"text":"Burgers don't get better than this in the GTA! Located just north of Yonge and Steeles, this place is a hidden gem in Thornhill! Burgers are between $7 - $12 and are always fresh patties. There's plenty of parking at the back of this restaurant too. Free toppings include: onion, tomato, relish, lettuce, pickles, and caramelized onions (highly recommend the caramelized onions!!!!!). Sauces include: BBQ, ketchup, mayo, mustard, and chipotle. Other toppings such as cheese, mushrooms, etc, are an extra cost.

CASH ONLY! There is an ATM in the restaurant but it takes 10% or 15%. Employees are always friendly - they'll say things like \"what can I get for you today, boss?\" or crack jokes with you. There's a TV inside that's always playing some game (great place to watch the Jays in the summer). Try the onion rings while you're here! Burgers get super messy so get the napkins ready."}
{"text":"This is a Toronto icon. The burgers are fantastic. I've never had anything else there because I always go especially for the burgers. 
Great atmosphere. 
This is one of my regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"It's an old school family run burger joint.  The thing you need to know about Golden Star is that they have two burgers.  There's the regular out of the box premade patties and then there are the homemades.  Only order the homemade burgers.  You will pay more, but they are worth it.  They're thicker, juicier and taste much better.

What goes on the burgers?  There's no chipotle aioli.  Your choice of toppings are pretty traditional ketchup, mayo,  bbq sauce, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles and hot peppers.  They will also add cooked onions if you want them.  The onion rings are pretty good as are the mulititude of shakes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place, for nearly 2 decades, seeing an entire generation of the owner's family grow up. 

It is one of those rare neighbourhood spots, which keep disappearing at an alarming rate - glad to see it still be around. 

The burgers are excellent, the service is superb (most of the staff have been there for eons - was really surprised to see some new employees). 

I've been there hundreds of times, and will probably visit hundreds of times to come :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers (homemade only) and amazing onion rings. I wish I could return but I found a long hair in my fries and had to pull it out of my mouth... Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good, not great, and way overpriced. The famous steak on kaiser sandwich, for example, is a small but decent cut of beef. But by the time you add fries and large soda to your meal (no combos available) you're out $14.55, too much for what you get. The same goes for burgers and hotdogs. But the place is clean, guys are professionals and thanks to a great location, place is always busy. Three stars on a stretch."}
{"text":"KThis hurts me so much, you have no clue, I love Golden Star, when I would bite into that jucy, grilled burger with that amazing BBQ sauce, I would be flooded with pure food euphoria.
Now, the skys have darkened over Golden Star, I walk in and there is no sparkle, the magic seems to be gone, I buy their burger now, and it's smaller than I remember, I bite into it waiting for those endorphins, but the burger tastes different, almost, I know it's sacrilegious to say, but, it tastes, almost store bought, I know it's not, but the taste is off. 
All my life I've eaten at this amazing diner, with my parents when I was a wee ting, to when I was a teenager, doing co-op at the roy foss across the street, and now to present day.
From all that time, just these past two to three years, the recipe for the burger has been tweaked or a supplier has changed.
I'm still giving you guys 4 out of 5 stars because the burgers are still good just not as good as it once was, and, for all the memories. (Cue Memories song)"}
{"text":"Thornhill, my home turf! Golden Star has been a family favorite for 35+ years for my family.  My parents took my brothers & i there all the time when we were kids. My brother played on their soccer team when he was in elementary school and knows everyone there by name. We were there every week to eat in or take out! If you look at any top 10 list for best burger places you WILL find Golden Star on it and for many reasons! It is on my top 3 list with Johnny's & The Burgers Priest. The combination of meat vs seasoning makes their burgers so good and then grilled to perfection. Their fresh cut fries are AMAZING and you can't have a burger & fries without their onion rings. I had a burger, fries w/gravy and a large grape drink recently. Hubby had a steak on a kaiser which was grilled to the right temp and served on a fresh kaiser bun, kids had tenders & fries and finished all of their food! Usually my hubby orders his burger with nothing on it because he loves the taste of the patty/meat. No need to over power with a crazy amount of toppings on these burgers. Less is more - and believe me - you want to taste how good the patty is. 

I was surprised to read a few other reviews saying the restaurant & decor is outdated.  Their decor is classic & vintage - no need to update. It's all part of the experience. Staff & owners are friendly, funny and very pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a no frills diner with good burgers and fries... as diners should be. The service is great. Very friendly staff. It's cash only so bring cash!! We didn't know that initially, and their ATM was out of cash so we had to go to the bank across the street to take out money. If you have the appetite, make your fries a poutine. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tried many burgers over the years in Toronto. This place is still top 5 for me. It has a unique taste of its own. It has a diner feel to it and the best part is they serve beer. 

Recommend to eat there as by the time you get home the burgers will be soggy. 

Prettt much its a gem in the rough. You will enjoy the burgers. Mame sure to get home made."}
{"text":"This restaurant received a lot of hype from my coworkers so I figured I'd give it a go.

The decor is similar to that of an old diner and more like something you'd see closer to cottage country than in Toronto. That being said, there is plenty of seating both indoors and on the patio.

The service was quick, friendly and somewhat funny with just the right amount of cheek from the burger assembly guy.

I ordered a burger combo and added cheese and bacon bringing my bill to $10.11 after tax. It's important to note that they only accept cash here, which kind of threw me because I hardly ever carry cash. They do have an ATM machine on site but let's face it, anyone that values the security of their debit card would NEVER use one of these!

Thankfully, my (dear, sweet, kindhearted) friend spotted me a tenner so I wouldn't have to spend the afternoon washing dishes. We proceeded to the condiment aisle (which is quite similar to the set up at Harvey's) to have our burgers dressed and off we went.

Now, as you may have seen from my previous reviews, I do suffer from the occassional burger craving. Unfortunately, this would not have satisfied that craving. The patty, although seasoned nicely, was very thin and somewhat reminiscent of the processed burgers I used to get in my high school cafeteria.

I'm not saying it tasted bad, it didn't... but I didn't get the impression that it was a homemade burger. It wasn't thick and juicy like I've read in other reviews of this restaurant... messy, yes (make sure you have plenty of napkins!) but that was more from the condiments I selected. The fries, on the other hand, seemed to be hand cut and were cooked nicely.

I can't say that I was overly impressed with my experience at Golden Star. For now, I will have to give them a 2 (and a half) star because although I have experienced better, I will give them another shot and try something different."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers wow! The place has been there forever and could use a makeover, but I guess that's what they're known for. It is a little ridiculously priced for what you get but worth it once in a while for my cheat days."}
{"text":"With the thaw we're starting to finally work through our growing list of Toronto bookmarks. 

Was happy to get takeout from GSR and finally taste a non-chain burger. Got the All-Star, per recommendations, and am forced to conclude that chargrilling overwhelms the nuances of beef that I prefer to taste. 

For me, way better than Hero, but south of Five Guys. The search for the elusive 5-star burger continues. (Though technically I would've given 5 stars to Don's Drive-In in Traverse City 30 years ago...and probably today if I ever got back).

My family tells me the place is entirely retro and the guys are super cool and efficient."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST burger in the city, and being a burger connoisseur I try one everywhere I go, and have yet to have one better than Golden Star's.

I kid you not I have a burger AT LEAST once a day. And this is by far the best I have ever had. 

If you are considering to eat here do not think twice. Go sooner than later because I guarantee it will change your life."}
{"text":"On the way to a meeting just around the corner on Doncaster, and on the prowl for some food, this place was a god sent! 
To the rescue? not quite, but it did fill my tummy.  When I came across Golden Star I immediately thought of those old burger joints that have tested the tides of time and survived in light of the usual burger franchises (McDon's, BurgKing, Wendys, etc).  

The decor, is still the same (as previous reviews) and has always kept its image as a burger joint/ diner still reminiscing with the orange color booths, brown laminated flooring, and Coke napkin dispensers..... for the real deal...

Firstly I found their burger patty could have been a wee bit bigger in comparison to others such as Anderson's, Johnnies, etc.  I felt that they could have added somemore flavoring to their burgers....but again maybe its just me! 

Secondly, their burger buns I felt could have been more toasted, and at one point it felt so flimsy that I was unable to hold the burger properly without having some of the ingredients falling out of it.  

The price of just a burger was a bit steep.... $4.80? hmmm....I understand that it's homemade... HOWEVER on the bright side their service, portions of fries are great I was just disappointed with their burger :("}
{"text":"A place that I have driven by for many years but never took the time to try. It's been around for 35 years and that does have to mean something. The burgers at this place are decent. The are large in shape and juicy. But they are a bit thin but not too much. The fries are also decent but not great. 

The only problem I have with this place is the lack of indifference by the employees. The place is a bit dump like. Trays are stacked high, floors are dirty, etc., Perhaps I came when it was extremely busy and the staff had no time to clean things up.

The restaurant does look its 35 years. It has a pretty retro vibe with bright orange curvy chairs and dark coloured tiles. I think it's pretty cool but others might think otherwise."}
{"text":"The Best there was, the best there is, and the best there ever will be!
That is all I have to say about GoldenStar.  I have been going to this place forever and I love the fact that they have not changed a thing in 50 years.
The steak on a kaiser with shrooms is amazing.
The home burger is the best in Canada and possibly the world. 
The fries are fresh cut and always good.
The Onion rings are addictive.
Even their wings are amazing.
My only complaint, the regular burger is not that good.  Its what they serve at Johnny's.   That frozen processed patty.  Some newbies will order that burger and say that this place is nothing special."}
{"text":"This was once my favourite place but recently they have gotten very rude!  The place feels really dirty, the burgers are good... but the experience overall takes away from the food.  
The biggest annoyance is when I hear CASH ONLY!  ... Guys we are in 2014 I won't pay a $2 fee to get an overpriced burger and we all know why business ask for cash only... 

My take is the place is good... I would support it over an franchise place, but I won't go out of my way to go there any more... I hope the turn it around"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers fries and service. A hit with the kids.  It's been a while since I've been but every time I go back it's everything it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"Food is 2 or 3 out of 5 stars, the service is probably a 1.

To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this place. One day I'll go and I'll feel like I got great service because as I'm walking out with two full bags the owner/manager will call out and ask if I need a box to carry them in, and I'll feel taken care of and great about my purchase.

But then there are nights like today where I walk in, order the same kind of meal I usually get (Combo 1) and once I get to the guy who puts the toppings on I realize they have no lettuce. Not even that big of a deal in the great scheme of things if you want a burger, really. But the thing that boggles my mind is how the owner/manager had enough awareness to let me know right away that I was buying the \"smallest burger,\" and then proceeded to accept my money, but omitted including the smallest of decencies to forewarn me that an important topping was missing from their roster. At 8:00 at night, when they've supposedly been out of lettuce all day because \"the holiday might have mixed things up with their supplier.\" (You can't go out and buy a couple heads of lettuce then? Whatever.)

Now a minor problem becomes a bigger annoyance because NOW I feel like I've been gipped. Not only was there no apologetic attitude about this big lacking of service, there was no acknowledgment of the shortcoming at all. I had to ask if there was no lettuce, and if I hadn't they would have all probably just acted like nothing was out of the ordinary. Guys, it's not like you're missing some hot peppers or you're short on tissues. Lettuce is kiiiiind of an important part of a standard burger.

Basically, if I'm paying almost 10 bucks for your \"smallest burger,\" I wouldn't mind being told that it's going to be incomplete. That's all I'm saying. The food honestly just isn't good enough to make up for this laziness and lack of consideration."}
{"text":"This is not a bash on this place but really a comparison to all the competition out there.
I have been looking forward to finally trying out this longstanding establishment, especially hearing many recommendations from friends. 
I ordered the Homemade Allstar 6oz burger. I liked the numberous sauces and toppings which helped to make the overall burger moist and juicy. The burger meat had a very beef taste which I like, however, in comparison to other establishments like Hero Burger or my current favourite, Freshburger, the burger was dry and dense. It might be how it's suppose to be, but my taste shifts towards a thicker and loose patty.
Finally, the price is what seals the deal. The burger alone came to $9.30 where at other establishments that would provide a full combo. Maybe it's location and history but it's hard to justify the price when there is so much competition out there."}
{"text":"My last review was a little harsh, and Ive been here a couple of times since then.
The food is good, and the son/sons(?) do try their best with customer service which is definetely good. I witnessed one (idiot) customer who ordered a burger, and as they were about to put his toppings on it he decided to change his mind and get a chicken instead. It was kind of busy, so something like this would be really annoying to the cooks/management. But the \"manager\" definitely did a good job handling the situation and the idiot had his chicken burger in no time. 

The burgers are good, and combos are super filling. 

Probably the only hand-burger place id return to multiple times."}
{"text":"I think that people like the CONCEPT of this place more than the actual place itself. Everyone likes to tell their friends \"oooh I know this old school place that sells amazing burgers and its a classic or I'm so cool for knowing that this old burger joint with amazing(sarcasm) burgers exists.\" Exactly like burger shack or burger hut on eglinton and on Sheppard respectively,  Let me tell you what I think. I think they use cheap meat, they are dirty, excessively greasy, cheap everything, the fries suck, just because they serve it in an old style basket and a paper doesn't make it good. I bet the only reason this business is surviving is because its owned the land that its on since god knows when. If it was soo amazing and was doing well then they would renovate and keep up with all the other businesses that develop over time, I bet the owner is making a little bit of profit to get by but but obviously not enough to fix up the place. Cash only? I wonder why?"}
{"text":"One of the best home made burgers in Toronto! 

The place's been here since 1964, it is old-school but with good food! The place is big with enough tables. You have to order at the register and wait till it gets ready for pick-up, so no one is bringing food for you if you mind ;)

I ordered Homemade burger with onion rings. The burger tasted absolutely good and different from other burger shops, it was juicy and made with real meat and a tasty mixed sauce (it was a bit too spicy for me though) and the onion rings were so crispy and good, I really enjoyed their food.

The only thing I need to mention is they only accept cash! And if you don't have, you need to get from ATM and get charged! It surely is better if they accept debit cards too! 

Overall, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place needs a renovation. Get rid of that dingy yellow sign and slap a smile on the manager's face and this place would start looking friendlier.

As for the burger, its nicely seasoned and the toppings are fixed to your liking. Fries are hot and fresh, like they should be. Lines are extremely long so be you'll be standing on your feet for awhile.

Decent place to eat a well-made burger, beats Hero Burger for sure."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had so far in Toronto.  Excellent flavour.  The fries, which are served unsalted, are also first rate.  Counter service was friendly and pleasant.   Old fashioned local feel.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The only reason I give 2 star is bcos the customer service..Customer service is very good!! The burger is horrible!! The reviewer that gives more than 3 starts prolly cos they got no tastebuds or don't know any better burger n also prolly cos they been here for a While so \"reputation\" maybe also the reason. It's floppy n no taste!! Go to FAT BURGER instead in disera dr! U WILL NEVER regret it!!!"}
{"text":"After a 2.5 hour nap... yes I said it, a NAP, I was absolutely famished.  What place in my area would pack a wallop of food and flavour that I have not tried yet?

GOLDEN STAR!  Business has been open since 1964 which is amazingly impressive considering the developed area.  The website said that they will be celebrating their 50th Anniversary this year.  I have been driving by this place so many times but have not had a chance to go cuz some other food place was tickling my tummy fancy.  It was time to try their signature burger.  

Reading the reviews on Yelp, it was totally helpful as I was prepared to go in with CASH and order their famous \"All Star Homemade Burger\" with fries!

That I did and in a combo might I add.  My wife got the ordinary hamburger for $4.80 and was not impressed at all.  It was such a normal, thin patty boring burger and was not worth the price.  

When our burgers were ready, one of the burger dressers said that they would bring the fries to our seat as they were fresh going into the fryer.  Unfortunately, they forgot to bring it to my seat and I had to walk over to them to remind them.  They apologized.

My All Star Homemade Burger was absolutely stupendous!  I am totally a fan of this burger.  It was soft, flavourful, kinda like melt-in-your-mouth quality beef patty.  Couldn't really get enough of it!  Each bite was delicious and the condiments helped big-time.  The water from the hot peppers and pickles made the bun a bit soggy which broke it apart but I still enjoyed it.  Next time I am going to have the burger with normal diced onions instead of caramelized onions and no hot peppers to reduce the water.

I never really rave about French Fries that much but THESE were seriously a cut-above your normal fry place.  They were fresh, medium thickly cut and were down right delicious.  Reminds me of higher grade Swiss Chalet fries.  It comes with a basket in a generous portion.  Totally complemented the burger.

The drink size was a bit smaller from our normal \"medium\" in other fast food joints but meh, whatevz!

Love the old school 70s/80s vibe to the restaurant.  Takes me back to the old school 80s McDonald's.  We went at around 9PM and there was a lot of people seated although no line-up.  I gotta hit this place up again in the future and get this combo again for that $10.99 deal."}
{"text":"Prices were not bad, however the main star, the burger, was not the best I've had. The burger was a bit thin and the bread too bulky.  Fries and onion rings were good and they give you a big amount."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out this place after hearing so many good things about it! Let's just say I'm definitely coming back. I must say it's a hidden gem. I'm always around the area and I can't believe it took me this long to come try it out. At the time they were only accepting cash but they have an atm machine inside for those who don't carry cash. You get to see them make your burger which is always a plus for me. The onion rings were so crispy, I'm still drooling while writing about it. From the service down to the food; everything was great."}
{"text":"Was craving a burger. Hard to find a good burger place now a days. Saw Golden Star Burgers and decided to try it. If i had to just rate the burger i would give it a 5 star. Tasted great, fresh and cooked to my liking. 
Got the sweet potatoe fries, and i love sweet potatoe fries but was disappointed with these ones. Very thin, flimsy and oily . 
Price is also a little high for just burgers and fries. 40$ for two burgers and fries. def not worth it...So 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Dont know what took me so long to come try this place.  Burgers are awesome! Fries...amazing! Service...great!  I've driven by this place for the last decade or even more...heard excellent things about it and never thought to stop by!  Until now.  I am hooked.  You know when you eat a burger and you have this crummy feeling in your belly afterwards because it was so greasy?  I get that all the time.  This place however leaves you wanting more! Gotta go back soon!"}
{"text":"OK so we sent as a company of 4 ppl at this restaurant at 10:40pm without knowing what time they're closed at. We asked when they're closed at and they didn't properly answer, just concentrating that they'd get the money from the dishes we ordered. We got the burger at 10:50pm and 5 mins after they were asking each of us if we'd finished the meal, and 11pm straight they switched off the light. We thought it was kind of rude so we wrote this review together. It is unacceptable to treat customers like this, and they should've told us to just get the dishes to go and not taken at the restaurant because of the closing time. The burger quality is alright however but quality of satisfaction is under average. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Best Burger anywhere...and great fries too ! The home made burgers are the best....flame broiled and all of the toppings that you want to put on. The problem with all of these new burger restaurants is that they make them on flat grills and all of the fat stays in....at Golden Star, they are flame broiled and the fat drips out and you get the amazing bbq flavour...and those fries...mmmm yummy !"}
{"text":"I like these independent burger joints. Esp when the decor is a little out of date you know they are relying on the quality of the food rather than a swanky atmosphere to attract people. Food is good here. Fries were a little overdone and almost burnt but at least they were real potatoes. Burger quality was very good. A combo will run u about $10 which is more or less expected, but I wouldn't consider it cheap. Try the milkshakes too - also not cheap at $4 or so but they are good."}
{"text":"As I get older, I'm always trying to eat better.  However, there are times where nothing beats a good burger.  Golden Star aptly satisfies that craving and then some.  Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area.

Pros:
100% pure beef burgers made fresh to order
Simplistic, no frills atmosphere
Burgers are well made, won't fall apart easily.

Cons:
Location might be a problem for those who don't drive
A little more variety on the menu couldn't hurt

Golden Star is pure old school.  I'm not born in Canada so my memories of old fashioned burger joints are from the movies.  Golden Star could of very been one of the places they could film those movies.  It's a simple place, no banners, frills and other unnecessary junk.  I honestly like the simplicity.  I'm here for a good burger, not eye candy on the walls.

Golden Star has a pretty simple menu.  They only got a couple of items, but they do them all very well.  I had the All Star special which is a 6 ouncer with bacon and cheese added.  I might as go all out right?  Burger was made fresh to order.  The staff there are very flexible on making the burger the way you want it.  Toppings are your standard fair.  They have a homemade BBQ sauce that's just divine. 

The burger itself is pretty well made.  I was suprised how well it held up throughout.  Only a couple of loose lettuce pieces and some melted mayo fell out while I was eating it.  The fries are alright, nothing special but nothing wrong either.  A combo will fill most people up pretty well.  Price for a combo is about 2 dollars more than a combo at McDonalds and that's well worth it.

So that's Golden Star in a nutshell.  If I'm in the area with friends and we're craving burgers, we're definitely coming here.  My fav is still Johnny's on Vic Park and Sheppard.  Golden Star is up there though, make no mistake about that."}
{"text":"Golden star surpasses most burger shops, but not by much. They're burgers are really good I give them that, they are big and satisfying but the patty itself would of benefitted from salt and pepper, the bun was a definite winner as it was soft and soaked all the deliciousness. The poutine definitely lacked, although there was an abundance on my plate (or whatever the basket weave thing this) I do believe they should of seasoned the fries before they drenched it in gravy and sprinkled cheese on it. Lastly, it definitely is pricey for what it's suppose to be, an old school burger shop. 

All in all, this place lacks seasoning. If you need to bring your grandparents anywhere for lunch, this is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"I really do not know what all the fuss is about
I made a special trip, planned for the day and EVERYTHING because i love me some good burger
But i was quite disappointed
The burger was so thin and too charred on the outside
it hardly held up with the bun and toppings and everything
It was also flattened sooo much...all the beautiful juices escaping and just too much charring
Definitely not impressed and definitely would not go back"}
{"text":"Classic old burger joint that does fast food the right way

I've only been to Golden Star twice, but the second time was even better than the first. First off, you should get their homemade all star burger. It's more money, but worth it as it's made fresh in house. They charbroil it on the grill, and it's fresh, moist and tasty. The other thing that is a must is their BBQ sauce. It's absolutely delicious and has just the right amount of acidity to cut through the fattiness of the burger. To be honest, I'd recommend getting everything on your burger, but feel free to omit things you don't like.

I tried the fries on my second trip, and they are delicious and the portion is huge. You can definitely share a portion with two people.

Another thing worth noting is I believe it's cash only, but there is an ATM. So yeah, bring cash. Also the staff there is very friendly. My girlfriend wanted a splash of pop to take a pill with, and they gave her a free refill on the house (even though they don't do that). Definitely one of the better burgers in the GTA, and I definitely hope I'll be back. This is a place you'll want to take your kids too. And one day, they'll want to take their kids too."}
{"text":"Can't say this classic burger joint is worth the 3.5 stars it has on Yelp..

Ordered a MVP burger (2 x 6oz patties on a kaiser bun).. $14.10 - cheese is $0.75 extra.

Burger was dry and didn't have much flavour, even tho the juices were just dripping right into plate as I eating it..  Also the patties were flat and big as opposed to thick.. I guess that's why it didn't have much flavour and didn't taste juicy..

Place has been making burger since 1964 (so it's says all over the place).. And the place did have lots of customer when I went 10pm at night.

Bonus is, old fashion burger joint with LLBO!

I would say 2.5 stars.."}
{"text":"If you're from Thornhill (Like I am) Golden Star is pretty much a staple.  It's the first place aside from the Tim Hortons parking lot that you go to hang out when you get your license. Anytime I go home to visit the parental units my younger sibling tends to suggest g-star. This place SCREAMS greasy spoon, but my oh my is it spectacular. My regular order is a standard burger, fries and a pop. This runs about $10 which is about the price you pay for a burg combo in the city these days. The home made beef patties are out of this world! There is JUST the right amount of grease which is sopped up by the super fresh bun which is instantly soggy after the first bite. 

I swear this is the reason why I have such a soft spot for diner/ homestyle food. Truthfully it's places like this that are the reason why I never cook."}
{"text":"This place is great, super solid, delicious burgers, fries, and a great place to get a lunch. Staff is super friendly as well.

Cash only, but there's an ATM there, or a RBC across the street."}
{"text":"Just went in for fries and gravy to go. Got home only to find the small carton of gravy was  literally half full.  Buyer beware.  Check before you go"}
{"text":"Trust me... here is your order; Deluxe Burger w/ Poutine... 
A big homemade patty w/ cheese and bacon... and their delicious gravy on a basket of fresh fries (and ofcourse some more cheese) ... you won't regret it..."}
{"text":"Roadhouse burger joints don't get much better than Golden Star. There's not a lot that you can make any criticism about here. The burgers are juicy and generous, big flavour and topped as you like. Their poutine is not to be missed either, chunky French fries, rich gravy and the ooziest curds you could imagine, a trip here without it is a trip wasted. The only thing that fell short for me was the onion rings, with the hopes of the colossal classics, I was handed a basket of crispy skinny rings. If you don't mind paying a little more for a top notch burger, it's a necessary visit."}
{"text":"Another restaurant I can't believe I haven't written a review for! This is hands down one of the best burger joints I've ever been to. It's family-owned and a jewel of the Thornhill area. 

I always get their homemade all star burger, as the beef patty is made in house with a variety of fresh ingredients. I absolutely love that I can get freshly chopped AND sautéed onions on one burger. 

It's an all-male cast every time I visit this place and they're all really great guys. They make sure to ask you exactly how you like your burgers and make them right in front of you. 

The burger can be a bit greasy, as well as their fries. But it's not like I could eat this every day anyway.. It's for those special occasions, when you feel like you've earned a golden star for all your hard work! ;)"}
{"text":"Golden Star is one of the places I missed when moving downtown.

It's very much an old school burger place that grills burgers over a flame, and when you drive by the smell of charred meat lures you in.

This is not gourmet, this is not Burgers Priest/California griddle style, you can't order your burger rare, but if you go, don't even think about getting the \"regular\" burger, its just a frozen patty, and you will be disappointed, unless you are under 12 years old.  

Get the homemade burger.  Yes, it costs a bit more, but it is house made, and it is loaded with garlic and seasonings.  Its not a thick burger but it tastes great when grilled over the flame.

The best topping they have is their sauce, I think they call it BBQ sauce but it is clearly a mix of a bunch of sauces and has a mustard bite to it, which is perfect on their burgers.  This is not rib bbq sauce.

I love their fries, because they are a good size.  I'm not a fan of shoestring fries, and I want a fry that is big enough to dip into the little paper cups of ketchup that you fill yourself.

The shakes are from a machine, but I think of them as a blend of shake and slushie... and the cappuccino is my favourite flavour.

They also have coke products, fountain and bottles, and that purple mystery drink that is the epitome of old school burger places.  

They have always been cash only, but I have noticed that is becoming more common every day with small restaurants, and I can't blame them considering the credit card companies take a cut, but it does mean you need to be prepared or be willing to use a no name ATM... shudder."}
{"text":"This is a Thornhill landmark, unchanged in decades. I'm amazed this stretch of Yonge hasn't yet been turned into towers and condos, which now loom right across the road, but Golden Star is still there in full retro glory. It's a burger joint as they were before McD made them into production lines. I usually get steak on a kaiser, delicious and not offered at chains, but the burgers are great too. I'm not a fan of the greasy battered onion rings, but many folks like that. (My best rings are at A&W.) You'll pay notably less for similar at a chain, but chains don't also provide a trip down burger memory lane, plus you can wash it down with a nice cold brewski. Take that, Harvey's."}
{"text":"In a city that is bombarded by chain burger joints and severely lacking in 'mom & pop' or independent restaurants this is a welcome sight for a newcomer.

This from I am told is a place that has been around for ages as a family owned institution in this area.  To be honest, I have seen and had better - without taking anything away from the Golden Star, they do a decent job and I would certainly prefer this over the clown and the king.

The homemade burger is huge and worth the price.  The condiments are laid out in the 'Harvey's' style with a wide variety of toppings and such (sliced dill, tomatoes, lettuce, sweet peppers....etc.).  They are a little skimpy on what they put on the burgers, so ask them for extra lettuce and other condiments.

What needs improvement here is the staff that doesn't seem to know how to work in unison, they are a little bit discombobulated in their teamwork.  They seem to clog up the moment a rush of clients come in.  I think they can improve and move up a star if they review the workflow for efficiency sake.

Oh, yes - this is a CASH ONLY restaurant.  Remember they have an ATM if you forget this important point."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I ever had in Toronto. Fresh, tasty, right portion and right price. Open late. Old style environment. Strongly recommend. 
However, cash only  ATM is available but charges fees."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. 

My friend and I ordered Homeburger with fries and Steak on a Kaiser. 
Homeburger was good and tasted fresh. 3 stars are for the burger. 

Fries were not very good. On a dryer side and soggy. Not sure if it was the batch I received that wasn't so great, but definitely had better fries. 

Steak on a Kaiser was not so great either. The steak was very thin and didn't have much flavour to it. We both agreed that we would not order it again. 

All their food tasted like something you eat at your friend's BBQ parties. Maybe that's why people like it? Just nothing special. 
I really wanted to like this place as it has great reviews on Yelp, and has been in business for a long time. 
Quite disappointing, but maybe I'll give it another try sometime."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. A. Godsend.

If you want to know what a real burger tastes like, you go to Golden Star Burgers. The All-Star and MVP hamburgers are the star of this quirky, old-school joint... and when I mean old-school, I mean it. The decor screams 60s diner; it almost feels like you should expect a waitress rollerblading to your table with your food.

And I love it.

An All-Star burger lands you 6oz of pure beefy goodness and their MVP burger, 12oz, with your choice of toppings. Think Harvey's, but mounds better. I ordered the All-Star and the portion size was enough for me, but I'll definitely be back for the MVP.

It's really hard to describe the first bite of this burger, but let's just say it was gone in seconds. The patty is super juicy and packed with flavour. Paired with their onion rings and it's a match made in heaven.

What's really nice about this place is how you're able to see them assemble your burger in front of your eyes. You can tell how fresh their ingredients are.

If you're in the area, stop by one of the best, if not THE best, burger places in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best burger place and although I don't live in Thornhill I drive up for a burger from time to time when the cravings hit. Usually I add mushroom which makes it go from great to MMMMMFFFFF YESSSSSSS"}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 star review.  Had the home burger combo which includes their home burger, fries (Yukon golds) and drink (coke products served) for 13.00 all in.  You can add cheese and bacon to your burger at additional $.  These are not truly charbroiled over charcoal for the extra smoky flavor but gas grill which gives the patty a nice bark.  The decor is very fitting for the old school feel and has a separate bar area for beers if u want a cold one to accompany your burger.  One word of warning, the old school decor also extends into the washroom and only use if u really need to or take a deep breath and do your business fast!"}
{"text":"Wow. Ive been here many times as a child and I remembered loving the food. I finally went here recently and the burgers were such a disappointment. The vanilla milkshake was so icy too... Spending basically $40 for two burger combos that tasted less than mediocre. Never again. Go spend your money at a Harvey's"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger.
I ordered the MVP, and rings.
The rings were good. Nothing special.
And the burger was pretty nice. They toasted the buns which I liked, and they add the toppings in front of you.

My only complaints were that the patty was somewhat tough  (like the burgers you get at am American diner but slightly better), and the bottom of the bun disintegrated because of all the juice from the patty and toppings.

Service was nice."}
{"text":"hmmm hmmmm nom nom nom... 

Stuffing my face with All Star Burger ($5.95) with all the condiments and onions falling everywhere... that's the enjoyment of eating this sloppy burger alone. 

The beef has so much bite and it is thick..so it still stay moist and juicy inside. Just love the charcoaled marks on my meat!!!

Golden Star's All Star Burger is sure an All Star in my burger list! 

The interior does have a certain charm... dated.. and familiar... And even the guys that fix my burger looks perfectly retro in his blue uniform... 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"There is no better place. Will always be my favourite. Classic taste. Homemade burger is the only way to go. Homemade BBQ sauce is to die for. James and family are the greatest in the Biz. Whenever anyone orders an original (frozen patty) I honestly feel like telling them to leave lol. There is no comparison with the homemade. Burgers priest, holy chuck - great taste - but where is the love? Steer inn - lol yeah right. Johnnys is cool but taste doesn't come close. Lots of cool burger places around Toronto - but GStar is the ONLY burger joint I LOVE."}
{"text":"After a negative experience in which my mother was rudely treated and continuously  contradicted by a staff member at the condiments lines, golden star management immediately rectified the situation. I am happy that the restaurant immediately took action and apologized."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want in a burger joint. This place has practiced their trade for over 50 years and you can really tell. The mixture of meat/seasonings in their beef is perfect. They have a really good poutine and I'd recommend upgrading to that if you're a fan. The fries themselves are good on their own though! 

I'll gladly come back to this place over and over and order their all star burger, it's one of the best in the city. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for fantastic burgers. Go for the home burger for sure. Great grilled onion topping. Would love to see grilled mushrooms too."}
{"text":"Best homemade burgers in town! 
And a great old school diner aura. Love it !"}
{"text":"Got the golden star burger combo and upgraded the fries to a poutine for 3$ extra. The burger was pretty good, the patty wasn't too dry but it also wasn't that juicy. 
The poutine was decent, I found the gravy and cheese curds pretty good but the fries itself had a weird texture."}
{"text":"'Golden Star... best by far'
Local burger joints like this just don't exist anymore.
Like Johnny's in Scarborough, this place is a true institution."}
{"text":"There food is great well priced. I write this because this is what yelp wants. Not the truth I'm sure no one will see this"}
