{"text":"I went here for lunch today. The tequila lime ribs are awesome they're cooked to perfection and have a great smoke. Great fries and prices aswell. Will definitely be back. The ribs really make this place stand out. Great to decor and ambience as well!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Clueless staff and lacking service. Kitchen is disorganized. This is my third time visiting . Did this place change ownership? Coz this place used to be a lot better !!!"}
{"text":"Not your average burger joint!  Nicely renovated inside for an upscale casual dining experience.  Staff is alway friendly and will bring your order to the table with a smile.  All kinds of different meats to try, although I enjoyed the Chevaps so much the first time I've never had anything else.  Definitely worth a visit, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Buns and toppings where all very fresh. We had the prime time and double cheddar with poutines. Poutine was also satisfying. Nice clean restaurant."}
{"text":"We were on a hunt for a good burger joint and that's how we end up at Big Butcher. We went there this evening and I ordered their signature classic burger (pljeska) with fries while kids and my wife got brio burgers, Serbian chevapi and delicious onion rings. The burgers are absolutely to die for. No kidding! The patty is fresh, tasteful and grilled to the perfection. They offer a wide variety of condiments ... the Serbian cheese (kajmak) is a MUST!!! The service is great, fast and friendly ...  we'll go back there for sure. Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"Lately I've only been reviewing places that surprise me and this one did.  We just had lunch there and we so happy to find a place serving naturally raised meat so well prepared.   Everything is made in house, including the bread and buns. 

The ribs were excellent, made European style... the meat is cooked to fall off the bone and then grilled for a bit of char.  You can choose a sauce but I thought they were so authentic that they probably don't need it.  They were delicious. 

My husband and son had salad, chevaps and the club.  All were very fresh and well prepared.  The chicken was delicious. 

We're happy to have found a place to grab a quick bite.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"OMG, I quite possibly just had the best burger in my life.  

I was craving a burger all day and googled \"best burger Etobicoke\" a few places came up including this place.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.

I had the diablo which was excellent.  The bun is made in house.  It wasn't too spicy so don't be too intimidated.  It was tasty and cooked perfectly.

The owner is very sweet and obviously takes great pride in his food and it shows.  

I definitely recommend this place.  Like i said, quite possibly the best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and well-presented on wood boards. Cevaps were unique and tasty! The Primetime burger and poutine were both quite good as well. The owner came by to greet us and was very sweet and also offered a plate of thin BBQ sausage which was delicious. My wife bought some jarred spicy spreads to take home. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girlfriend on a Sunday just as they were about to close. Staff were friendly and insisted it was ok and that we could order. I got the souvlaki bun. My gf got the ribs. Souvlaki was tasty, although i found the flat bread to be a bir too much breading. My bad as i meant to order it without bread and salad instead. My girlfriends wings were nice, soft and fell off the bone. The sauce was mild, im not sure if the offer more choices in bbq sauces but I would normally prefer something hotter and more spicey. Still good though. They are new so im sure they will add to the menu over time. The restaurant itself is nicely laid out with plenty of seating and the staff seeming very nice. Prices are decent, not too expensive. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Fantastic quick spot to grab some burgers and other fast-food staples. I live less than a minute drive from the shop and I'm in there at least 1 every 8 weeks. Chevaps, Lamb Burger, Poutine, Primetime Burger, Chicken, Salads it's all great quality"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to drop into this place ever since it opened. I became a little hesitant when I discovered that it, like the AWFUL restaurant down the street, specializes in Balkan cuisine. Not that I don't like Balkan cuisine... it's just that I had such a terrible experience at the place down the street.

Well I was more than pleasantly surprised. I absolutely loved every single thing about my Pork Belly Sandwich and Sweet Potato Fries. The pork was perfectly tender with a wonderful sweet glaze, served on one of those European soft buns. It was perfectly balanced by the crunch of the pickled cabbage and the saltiness of the spicy mayo. And it was all complimented with that little hint of cilantro you'd get every now and then.

The decor of the place is very nice and welcoming, almost charming. There are plenty of magazines laid out in case you want to really take your time. It's very clean and spacious to boot!

It still grinds my gears, however,  when places call themselves BBQ when they have NOTHING to do with BBQ, (just like the \"place\" down the street). Also, please don't compare this place to Appalachia on the Queensway. They're two entirely different cuisine types. Appalachia makes true Southern BBQ and this place is a European Grill.

Perhaps I'm being too generous with 5 stars after only one visit, but thinking about my next Pork Belly Sandwich from this place puts me in a great mood!

I'm sure I'll be back. Soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a better rating, but I got sick after this, and my wife wasn't feeling all that awesome either.  I like this place better than she does, but there's nothing all that special to it in the end.  Great variety, but something missing in the taste/flavour sadly.  I *might* try this place again, I'm not sure.

The real reason we came here: Burger's Priest was packed to the gills on Saturday afternoon, quel surprise.  We like it there, but people in the neighbourhood know about it now, making it that much harder to eat there.  Aside from the wait, I'd prefer the Priest as well."}
{"text":"The Good:
Burgers. Had the Brie Burger and it was delicious, with a nice twist. Who would have thought cranberries on a burger could work?? The real clincher that sets this place apart though is the bread. Made in-house and very tasty. 

The Bad:
Fries are a little ho-hum, but that won't stop me from coming back. It's a BBQ place after all, not New York Fries.

Overall this is a great alternative to my favourite burger joint in Etobicoke and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time I've been here. I will definitely be back. I had the diablo burger and it is one on the best burgers I have ever had. Reasonable prices great customer service. Apparently there will be brisket and pulled pork available tomorrow so I will be back later this week."}
{"text":"They are so disrespectful ...the food tastes so awful and burger was cold. We came as office lunch and two of us got soup from somewhere else...the lady came and s√†id that we are not allowed to bring outside food!!! So they stopped eating the other food....they just lost a full office costumer....dont know how they got 4...must be all fake i guess...salty and saucy"}
{"text":"I would say the overall rating on this place is correct around three stars.  

The burger had that eastern european half burger, half pork sausage flavour to it (which I like) and was very thin.  So if you came in here hoping for a giant beef burger, you ain't getting the giant burger or beef flavour here.  That said, the burger tasted fine, toppings were adequate and bun was decent.

Fries were fresh cut and nice (a little undercooked but that is a personal preference), but way too small a portion for my liking.  

I would say no pleasant surprises, but a few disappointments. 

- Burger needs more meat
- Combo needs more fries
- Combo is a bit pricey for this neck of the woods"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today Swiss magic burger, onion rings. Did take out I'm only 5 min. away.
Onion rings were soggy batter falling off with an odd taste (not onion) I would say the oil was old but the place is pretty new.
Swiss magic had cheese, caramelized onions honey mustard (couldn't taste mustard) added pickles
Magic would have been that I ate the whole thing the burger lacked seasoning and overdone.
With a banana bread

Maybe I should have relied something else like the first review. 
Lots of competition in area. Ie BP
I don't know if I'll go back and try something else.
Service was slow but if it's good I don't mind.
Two owners appeared to be doing a job interview at a table table!? $16 tax in with a pop.
Not worth it."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood to pick up some hardware, and decided to try Big Butcher BBQ out.

Easy-to-find place right on Kipling.  They close at 8pm (although their website says 8AM), which isn't surprising since they're in a no-man's-land, and I can't see people just stumbling upon it.

According to the waitress who took our order (waitress may be misleading, since you order at the counter and then they bring the food to you), they've apparently been open for about a year, and are only now starting to get some attention.

It's not traditional southern BBQ they serve (although we had the ribs and they were competently done - would have liked a bit more smoke, but definitely fall-off-the-bone and flavourful).  Rather, it's Balkan, with Chevaps (little grilled pork rolls), and Plyeska (grilled pork patty).  I had the Hungry Man combo which included chevaps, plyeska, souvlaki (a flat cut, rather than the more common cubes), sausages, and some pretty good fries.

Partner had the spinach arugula salad with salmon (good, but salmon was a bit overdone for my tastes).  Others at the table had the swiss magic burger (again good, but not mind-blowing), and the ribs (surprisingly good, despite not being smokey).

Place was nearly empty, but we were there near closing time, and expect it probably gets hopping earlier in the day.  We also saw a couple of people who'd obviously come in for take-out instead.

We'll be back, but it won't be a rush."}
{"text":"Just went here with my bf. We both had the double cheeseburger with extra toppings. It was really good. The burgers have a lot of flavour and they taste more home style. The portions are HUGE!! The people that work there are really friendly and the atmosphere is really great. The place looks clean I definitely go back"}
{"text":"After so many positive reviews we decided to give this place a try. We went for the pork belly sandwich with sweet potato fries. 

The good?  Overall the whole meal was nicely seasoned and tasty. But, and this may be the deal breaker for some, if you like your bacon 'crispy' this won't be to your liking. For me eating pieces of pure soft white fat isn't my first preference. To each their own. 

Establishment clean, service friendly. Three stars for this round but will give their burgers and ribs a try at a later date.  I.e. something leaner :-)"}
{"text":"Had the pork belly special and the ribs. Both were quite good. The staff came by a couple times to make sure we were doing ok. We even got a free can of pop! Very nice service."}
{"text":"Love the food! Tasty meals with generous portions. I usually go for the ribs with the spicy tequila BBQ sauce. Smoky heat but not too overpowering. The burgers are also quite delicious with quite a few topping to choose from. I would highly recommend a visit sometime soon."}
{"text":"The food was decent but extremely disappointed at their customer service. If a customer requests a burger without bacon. You give them a burger without bacon. They accidentally gave me a burger with bacon. I told them you gave me bacon when I requested no bacon.... Guess what they did? Just removed the bacon reserved me the burger! I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasty... I think they make their own buns which is fantastic.
Plenty of option on the menu, I went with the Primetime and fries.  It was real tasty and well prepared.  Good seating available and the staff was very friendly and answered any questions happily.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant out for quite some time now as it also owns and operates The Butcher Shoppe on Shorncliffe.  I had called about a week ago about a possible catering order and spoke with Zibanko (I think he is the owner), who was so friendly and willing to accommodate.

Anyway, so my friend and I popped in for lunch on Friday. It's very casual, super clean and the service is extremely friendly.  I ordered the Prime Time Burger and my friend ordered the Lambo (lamb burger) with onion rings.  We waited about 10 minutes for the food to be delivered to our table.  When it arrived, it was presented very well and piping hot.

First of all, the burgers were huge so, if you go, make sure you're hungry.  They were served on a very soft and tasty bun that still had a bit of chew but did not compromise the integrity of the burger.  The bun reminded me of the bread that they serve at Anatolia (Turkish restaurant at Kipling/Dundas).  The meat to bun ratio was perfect (more meat than bun) and the quality of the meat was just outstanding - this is no Harvey's or fast food place.  The toppings were all fresh and they put just the perfect amount of condiments so we didn't make a mess all over the place.  It was simply a good quality, gourmet burger with a lot of thought put into it.

A huge plus is that you can purchase meat directly from the restaurant instead of going over to the butcher shop. Another huge plus is that they offer weekly specials; I think Monday is Prime Time Burger, fries and a drink for $9.95 - amazing deal!  Oh, and I should mention that they serve beer too!

Exceptional - five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Stop - Turn Around - Go to Royal Meats

Big Butcher is a Big Disappointment and its always hard to be this critical of a fairly new restaurant, however it is almost a crime when you hand over more than $30 for a burger combo and a rib combo and what you get is worst than what you'd get at Harveys for half that price. We visited at 7:15pm and they were closing at 8:00pm.

To begin with, the front of the restaurant looks promising with a bright front and large BBQ graphics and the interior is also not bad but that's very the nice part ends. I should also say that the service at the front counter was good. They had 3 digital menu boards with one screen off and no other menu of what was on there.

The Burger looked like a frozen patty on a home made bun. The fried onions tasted odd and the bread was much too \"spongy\". The onion rings with the combo were OK. The ribs appeared to be pre-cooked and then heated on a grill with sauce squirted down the middle and small annoying bones that were hard to locate.

Now I can imagine that at some times, like for lunch, the food may be better. We got there 40 mins before closing and it may be that they had food left over that was reheated. However with Royal Meats about 2 kms south and Appalachia on Queensway and Kipling, if you want great BBQ, those places are a sure bet."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Stuck somewhere between fast food and home style (both the food and the decor).  Big place with about 50 seats.  Clean, bright, and one smallish TV on one wall.  Tables can be moved around so it could work for a very large group.

Food took about 15 minutes before it was ready, so if you're in a rush keep that in mind.
Diablo Burger & Onion Rings & Pop = almost $15 after tax.  Ouch.  If they could get that down to about $12 it would be perfect.

Burger tasted pretty good (not too spicy), and was big!  Didn't add anything extra, as the toppings and chipotle mayo were enough.  Decent serving of tasty onion rings too.  Combined, I was stuffed.

3.5/5 - I'll try it again next time I'm in the area.  

(Washrooms were nice and clean too!)"}
{"text":"I've never had Balkan Barbecue before, so this was a bit of a new experience for the both of us! Service was fast and friendly, I ordered the Pork Belly Poutine, and Lee got the Primetime Burger. My poutine was great, and the pork belly was cooked well, but the gravy was a little on the sweet side, with very heavy use of allspice. I didn't completely hate it, but I didn't totally love it, either. The fries themselves were cooked very well and were tasty.

Lee was mostly happy with his burger, he found the texture of the patty to be a little bit unusual, but overall was pretty happy with it. I think if we went here again (and we probably would) I would definitely give the chevaps a try."}
{"text":"So far their Chevapi sandwich and their Pork Belly burger were insanely delicious. I found the sauce on the Pork Belly to be a little overwhelmingly tangy, but some people might enjoy that. That meat however is superb. I will be back, and back again."}
{"text":"A zero star would be more appropriate but the lady behind the cash was nice. Burgers taste like they were some frozen, preformed patties and the HUGE bun was time warped from the 80s. Where's the beef? 

The ribs were so incredibly  salty that I wonder if they brine then coat each rib with sea salt. I gave everyone at my table a rib and they couldn't finish the one. If this place is 4 stars the there is something wrong with Yelp or people have no taste buds. Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Yum! The pork belly is sooooo good! I love the glaze on it.
Went here on a whim...glad we did!

Everything was homemade...Patti had the double cheese burger, and i had the pork belly. We had the feta fries too.
We were the only ones there, so the girl behind the counter was pretty helpful and chatty. Some neat looking sandwiches there, including this sausage sandwich which I wanna try next time. Their bread is homemade too, even with sharing a parking lot with a bakery.
Everything came quickly and the portions were awesome. My pork belly was huge and tasty. I'm not a big cabbage fan, so i left it off.

There are plenty of options on the menu and a few eastern european groceries too.
Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week and I was not disappointed! I decided to try one of their burgers, while my date got the hungry man combo, and we were both very pleased with our choices. The meat was flavourful and cooked well, the fries were very good as well. We subbed one of our fries for onion rings, which were okay. 

If I had to choose between Big Butcher and Royal Meats (which is down the street), I would happily go to Big Butcher instead."}
{"text":"Yes I know, we are fish/veggie eaters at a meat bbq joint!!! But they do salmon burgers and lots a salads."}
{"text":"Explosion of flavour in every bite.   All homemade meats!  Even a Butchery on site.  Excellent pricing for the portions.  Just delicious... Etobicoke's new hidden secret!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food! I ordered the primetime burger and sweet potato fries; my husband got the lamb burger and regular fries. We both LOVED our food. Amazing flavor."}
{"text":"I was personally invited by the proprietor quite some time ago and it's taken a little while for me to make my way out west, but believe me when I tell you it was worth it. The menu strikes an interesting balance between traditional burgers, contemporary BBQ and Balkan favourites. The cevaps on the lepinje bread are definitely a staple here, but if you'd like something with an Asian-fusion twist I encourage you to try the pork belly sandwich, the meat literally melts in your mouth and shows excellent balance between sweet and spicy. The sides are excellent, poutine is rich and delicious, and the salads were fresh and crisp. Definitely a must-try for a gourmet sandwich."}
{"text":"3.5 but let's round it up.

 Food took a bit long to get, around 20 min but it was pretty good. Got the primetime burger $8 and the patty was nicely seasoned. Got the pork belly poutine $10 which didn't look like the pictures we saw on here but nevertheless was delicious. Only thing that I would change would be cutting up the pork belly. The large chunks made it a bit of a hassle to eat. Definitely get it though! Quite savoury. 

There is seating and they take credit!"}
{"text":"Came here very excited with my 15 year old brother, who absolutely loves burgers. We were very excited, and I have to say, portions are great. The big butch was HUGE! However, the bun was cold and the beef patty was a little too pink for my preference. 
We also ordered the pork belly poutine and the shevabs sandwich. I think the sandwich was the best of the two, huge disappointment since I was looking forward to a nice poutine. Nothing like the previous picture. White plain fries, and some kind of BBQ sauce which taste more like teriyaki than anything else. 
It's an OK burger joint, but we're still on the search for TO's best burger."}
{"text":"Right when we walked in, we were welcomed and given a run through of their resto, super friendly and informative! 

I decided on the pork belly and the bf got the chevaps with a side of onion rings. Onion rings were very good, nice flavouring from the batter. 

The chevaps was tasty, however should've probably added the kayak cheese as just the onion topping seemed bare. 

I am a big pork belly fan so I was anticipating this sandwich. The pork belly itself was bbq'd perfectly, however I felt the glaze overpowered the whole sandwich and it was all I tasted and was quite salty. 

Would go back though, would try one of the burgers next time. Oh and their buns are amazing!! The space it self was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork belly sand which, and they had no problem dressing up my burger however I liked. The guy working the cash is extremely friendly and pleasant to talk to. It was my first pork belly sand which and the only complaint I have really (well 2) is they put the sauce on the buns first so I had soggy buns, and I felt like there should have been some more meat in the sand which.... Otherwise, it was very good. It's mostly all burgers which is a shame.... I'd like to try the lamb burger next for sure."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I came here at 7:53PM and they close at 8:00PM, so I was happy they were able to make me a burger. I was looking forward to this place for a long time after reading such great reviews from fellow yelpers and really..who could say no to a good burger? 

Got the prime time burger combo to go-the burger itself was a patty, smoked cheese, bacon, and a delicious bun...but that was it, no lettuce, onions, or tomatoes, mayo, or ketchup. I'm not sure if I ordered it wrong or if it's that all it comes with? Heads up, the combo is just with fries, not fries+pop. Was really disappointed, and hope that it could be just chalked up to coming in late."}
{"text":"Here's my quick take:

Food: 3.5/5 Had a Burger and Pork Belly Poutine. Both were OK but nothing to rave about. Dont think it was worth it.

Service: 3.5/5 Choose and pick up your order. What can go wrong...Take 15 mins for my order.

Atmosphere: 4/5 The place looks clean and sits for 50.

Cheers."}
