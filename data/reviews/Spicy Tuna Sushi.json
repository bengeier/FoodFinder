{"text":"Made a to go order for lunch today. Even though they're a little far, I thought I'd give them a try since I heard so many good things. After driving 20 minutes to pick up my order and another 20 minutes driving home I find that they forgot the screaming o sauce. So I called them and tell them that they forgot the sauce, and they said they'll be willing to give us a discount the next time we go in. My husband was really upset because what is the screaming o without the screaming o sauce? But I was fine and told him its sashimi so we can eat it with soy sauce and itll be good, right? No.. we tried eating a couple pieces with soy sauce and it did not taste good at all. We just couldn't eat it, so I called back asking if they could give us a refund for the screaming o instead of the discount for next time. We'd be willing to drive all the way back and bring the fish because it's such a waste of $16 when we only ate a couple pieces of it. But they said they won't be able to do that and the best they can do is give us a 10% discount for next time. Seriously??? 10% is the best they can do?? We waste $16 today and they want us to come back again to spend another $16 just to get $1.60 discount. Really? That is just ridiculous. I work at a restaurant and it's really not that hard to void a payment. Or if this restaurant really doesn't know how to void payments, they could always give the refund back in cash. What's more upsetting is that I left them tip, and I never used to leave tip unless I was eating in. Seriously though... that's the best they can do..?"}
{"text":"Hands down:  Our favorite sushi place in Vegas!  Food and service are consistently awesome!  The D'z Guys roll is always a fan favorite... but, my personal favority is The Hulk!  We have brought many new-comers here and all been beyond impressed."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious, the waiter was friendly and attentive.  Loved the privacy of the booth seating. I will definitely be back and try more items from the menu so that I can give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls here have great flavor and textures combined. I love that there's daily specials although don't fall in love with any of them, as they tend to not remember how to make old specials. TVs around the bar make it convenient to catch a game and food at the same time.  The bar is the fastest way to get your food and service. Table is fine but they seems to have a team effort on attending tables. Sometimes I get refills/service when needed, sometimes I feel no ownership. Wouldn't recommend take out unless you call ahead. My last take out took over 25 minutes and the place wasn't that busy.  It's the rolls that keep me coming back. Try Ds guy, mike special, crunch bug, and Kelly D!!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi. Staff is quick, the rolls are fresh. Try the lettuce hand roll and one of my favs is D's guys special...the rolls pictured is the lettuce wrap & D's Guys. One of my rules is not to have fish in the desert but there are always exceptions to the rules and Spicy Tuna is one of those exceptions."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out orders a few times now (sooo easy when you're next door at TJ's) and they've always been very good.  There's a spicy tuna roll covered in avocado slices (I get it w/o the tabasco sauce) that is excellent!  The salmon roll and salmon skin roll are both great as well.  The service is always friendly and orders come out quickly.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi places in Vegas but Spicy Tuna really stands out. The nigiri sushi at Spicy Tuna has always been really flavorful and fresh. All of the rolls are really good and creative, my wife really loves the Birthday Special roll which doesn't look very easy to make but tastes really good. None of the sushi that I've tried here tasted bland which is  the problem at a lot of sushi places in the valley.   The service is great and very attentive, we usually sit at the sushi bar so I couldn't tell you what it's like to order sushi from a table."}
{"text":"This place is great for rolls - Sashimi is just good.  I always get the D's Guy and Justin Special... that is the way to go.  The music is a little ghetto"}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is one of our favorite sushi spots!  The Kelly D roll is so good and different from anything we've seen, its a must have!  The restaurant is clean and the service is good."}
{"text":"They are the best sushi in town and very friendly staff ;) clean restaurant very smily faces around and its very authentic food if you like sushi you should try it"}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure eating at Spicy Tuna. The fish is always fresh, every roll I've ever tried is delicious, the customer service is great, the establishment is clean and their prices are affordable! :) It's between Sushi Kaya & Spicy Tuna, can't decide which is the best place for Sushi in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and very tasty, unique rolls.  Lots of ponzu which they do wonderfully.  Everyone must try the Justin special, such a fabulous, light and tasty roll.  It's almost like a sushi salad. My only complaint is their eel.  It's fishy and just not the best.  Which is disappointing because I love eel.  But despite that this is our sushi place that we go to over and over and over again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sushi place to try out as my late birthday dinner and found this one, so glad! None of us had been before so we asked the server what the best rolls were. His suggestions were spot on. We ordered the Justin and The D Guy. With the Justin roll, I was a little hesitant with tomato pieces with sushi but it just worked! So refreshing and yummy! The D guy roll was equally as good (I liked that one best) with lots of flavors. I also liked how they started us with edamame. One thing they lacked was an All You Can Eat option, that would be so perfect! Can't wait to try their other options in the future."}
{"text":"We've lived in Vegas for 13+ years and this is absolutely the best sushi restaurant in town for locals!!!  Eddie and Gonzo rock! This is were we always end up for date!!! And now my 6 year old daughters asks to go there!!! Don't go to those other places that smell Fishy or like Lysol! Spicy Tuna is the best in town!"}
{"text":"Came back with my out of town visitors again. Everything was as good as the last time.  Started with jalapeno salmon (they ran out of tuna that night) and proceeded with the Kiss of Fire roll. Plenty of sake and cold Asahi :) My friends had Uni (which I still can't even remotely like :)"}
{"text":"I went here on Christmas eve with a party of 6 for lunch. The place was near empty, yet the chubby server would not let us sit at a bigger table. Instead we were crammed together at a table that had six chairs but should have only had four. The whole time we ate, bumping elbows and all, we stared at the larger table right next to us that no one ever sat at. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice and the sushi is pretty good albeit very specialized to their chef's likings.  The menu is virtually endless with more than 100 different rolls and then topped off with the different chef variations.  One thing I will say that with all this variety, it's difficult to get a sense of what's good and what's not since each roll, no matter if it's one that you've had before can be different each time you go.  Also, the prices are a little high with many of their rolls being over $10 and some even topping $15.  While I think their sushi is worth the price, it was still a bit of a shock the first time we went there and our meal for two was $100 including tip and no alcohol.  With all that, we'll still go back as everything seems to always be delicious and the service is way above par."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi my husband and I have ever had. We moved to Colorado but we always make sure to come here for our sushi fix. Every dish we have had is full of flavor, fresh, and mouth watering. Not only is the food amazing, Gonzo and Eddie complete the dining experience. They are always smiling, happy to see you, and remember the favorite items you like. It does not matter their business volume, they will always find a moment to chat and joke with you. BEST SUSHI IN VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"love this place  everyone is so nice and the food is awesome! Eddie is the man. He always remembers me and my boyfriend and our usual orders. More than satisfied every time!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for the spicy fare but my sister is!  The only problem I found was that even though the sushi was spicy, that was all I could taste!  I had to order a platter of sashimi special because I didn't want it spicy and it took a while for me to get an order of mussles.  When I did finally get it, it was very mayo-nasy which ruined it.  The best roll I had there was the NRES roll(I hope that's right) which had a nice garlic sauce to pour over it.  I probably will not be frequenting Spicy Tuna Sushi."}
{"text":"I would like to change my original post. I previously gave this restaurant one 1 star. I believe in second chances and went back to this restaurant.  I had the best experience this time! The sushi was amazing as it was the first time however I did pay in cash. I wish I could take my original post down. Thank you spicy tuna."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna Sushi is my absolute favorite sushi restaurant of all time. The employees are very nice and attentive. The sushi is remarkable, it's fresh and has wonderful flavor and textures. I love D's Guy, Katie Lo, Danny Hand Roll and Johnny Roll.  The D's Guy mix of soft shell crab on top of the rice and tuna is great. Katie Lo has mix of fish and cream cheese. I never liked cream cheese in my sushi, but Katie Lo makes me believe it's the best ever invented. I'm not a huge fan of seaweed, so the Danny hand roll wrapped in soy paper is fabulous and inside is shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and soft shell crab :) the Johnny roll is perfect for those looking for low carb and not fond of raw fish. It's crab mix with shrimp tempura wrapped in cucumber, deliciously refreshing. As many times as I try new sushi places, Spicy Tuna always wins."}
{"text":"I have literally no desire to live in Vegas but would almost consider moving for this sushi joint. Best service, delicious food, and good prices. I smiled the whole time I was there."}
{"text":"I've been to a considerable amount of sushi places in Las Vegas... And I have to say that this one is my favorite so far! They don't have AYCE but it doesn't matter to me, I never do that anyway. If you like edamame, their garlic edamame is the best one I've had at any sushi places. You must get it. As far as their sushi goes, I never get rolls, but I always get nigiri and their fish is super fresh!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi restaurant in Henderson. The food is always fresh and consistent and the owner, Eddie - always a joy to see.   Give it a try! We love it."}
{"text":"AMAZING ROLLS!!  The creativity is AMAZING!  The quality of fish is like that of a 5 star restaurant.  You will never get bored here.  There's over 100 rolls!  I always order the Kelly D and then try something new each time.  The rolls aren't loaded down with rice like with AYCE and the people that work there are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This is an office favorite. We come often for lunch because the service is great and there's always room.   The highlight is the variety of rolls that they offer. I recommend the jackpot, joe's special, or flying eel rolls. All the typical rolls are there too like the rainbow, caterpillar, and crunchy shrimp rolls as well.  As far as quality of fish, it's fairly standard. The cut are generous.   There is no all you can eat special, so if you're hungry, it can end up costing you. I recommend this place if you feel like a roll two in a uncrowded atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love Eddie! He took my sushi virginity and I have yet to go anywhere else! The sushi is fantastic, very fresh and very well priced! Gave a roll to my soon to be father in law who is from Tahiti and he LOVED it. The staff is wonderful too. I would have to recommend sitting at the sushi bar for the best experience tho!"}
{"text":"We come here every two weeks or so. Hubby loves the Screaming O (I hate the title of this dish, but sushi lovers will know it). I get the Justin Special--it is delicious: fresh and refreshing. The nigiri and sashimi are OK. Try the tempura green tea ice cream. Friendly staff...if you speak a little Japanese or Korean, they will appreciate it! A place for the hipsters, so if you don't mind the \"urban\" sound track, you might find this to be your neighborhood sushi place."}
{"text":"Very unique rolls (some with no rice that are phenomenal!), and a huge and diverse menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place really does deserve 5 stars.  I love the sushi here and I eat sushi quite a bit.  This is my favorite sushi place of about 20 I have tried."}
{"text":"I understand that there are sushi spots on every corner these days and that everyone swears that their spot is the best, but they are all wrong unless their sushi spot is spicy tuna! The quality of the fish paired with unique creations are what makes this place surpass any other. Eddy, the owner, is behind the counter flanked by gonzo, his number 2; with two pages of specialty rolls, you will find your own new obsession. My addictions: begin with a 2 pc garlic tuna and order spicy garlic edamame but only after getting your complimentary edamame and dipping them into the cucumber salad dressing, then order a D's Guy or Kyle, and instead of dessert, finish with a Japanese Lasagna.  This IS the best sushi spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?? This place is great. The service is responsible and friendly, the ambience is great, and the sushi is decadently delectable. Some of my favorite things to order there are the Hooter's Special, Chad special,  Yum yum handroll,Princess Deana, and Bam Bam special, but you cant really go wrong with anything on their sushi menu. I Love Sushi used to be my fave, then I tried Spicy Tuna and haven't looked back. Also, if you eat here often, the staff will start to recognize you each time you come in. Whenever I walk in, they all cheer \"Sammy, Sammy!\" Do yourself a favor, and try Spicy Tuna. You certainly won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The service has alway been exceptional.  This is the only place I'll eat sushi. I highly recommend trying the \"Ting\" with carrot (unless you love fired onions) or the try the  \"Justin\" it's also amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots! Almost everyone is polite and personable. Sushi is flavorful and atmosphere is relaxing. A nice little spot :)"}
{"text":"Consistent quality sushi.  Kyle and poke bowl are faves.  Take out a lot... definitely a family treat!!"}
{"text":"Blah. Went there for lunch and it seemed it was all about cutting costs and saving money. Lunch special was full of upcharges...just charge a dollar more for the special to begin with instead of having the little note that says this and that and the other will cost you a dollar more. A sashimi platter would be nice as well. The spicy tuna roll was good but the rest just seemed like fluff. A potsticker that was chewy and a spring roll that was laden with grease. Perhaps it was just an off day with the food, but the menu could use some revamping."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.... Absolute worst sushi and calamari I have ever had! The calamari was rubbery and tasted like they bought it frozen from Costco. I could have bought better sushi from smiths or vons. Service was great, they understood my dissappointment. Sapporo was superb!"}
{"text":"Their food was ok it seemed very sweet for my taste we had the Kyle special and the dan role.    The service was mediocre there were only two tables occupied including ours upon our arrival, after five minutes of waiting we had to find the waitress to order.    I would recommend kaizen or sushi mon  if your on this side of town both have better food and superior service"}
{"text":"I won't be back! I didn't appreciate the staff mocking me. I know my server could speak perfect English, but instead put on a show while laughing behind my back. I've been to many sushi places around town and there is nothing special about this one."}
{"text":"I was torn on the stars to give because I think the food is very good and pricing reasonable HOWEVER the service is HORRIBLE.  When my husband and I went the first time we didn't have a problem.    We went a 2nd time with another couple and the waitress had no clue and was very confused with simple orders.  It took some time trying to get her to understand what we wanted (which wasn't complicated at all!).  We all enjoyed the food.  The 3rd time we went with 2 other couples it was a horror show.  A total circus.  Everything got screwed up.  Had the same waitress that couldn't understand us and got the order wrong.  I didn't get soup with my dinner special, my friend didn't get what was supposed to be included with the dinner special (just the main dish), others issues also.  When we left they actually gave my friend the tab and he gave them his card and got the card back with a receipt but no place to sign. He thought that weird.    The ladies went to the restroom and the guys went outside.  We were stopped on the way out telling us we didn't pay!  What ended up happening is they never ran the tab even though they gave him a receipt.  We couldn't believe it.    I'll probably go back with just my husband (and pray we don't get the same waitress!) because the food was good but will never bring anyone else again.  I've recommended the restaurant twice and twice was embarrassed because the service was bad.  If we have issues again, that will be the last time we go back.  Before we left, we did get a great dessert on the house because of the mess up which was nice of them.  The dessert was very good and will probably order it again!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp Review. I actually signed up for Yelp , specifically to review Spicy Tuna.                              I currently live in San Francisco , and as you know... SF has amazing food! I have had some of the best Sushi , in SF. However, when I went to visit my family in Las Vegas, Nevada ( my home town) my mother took my boyfriend and I to ' Spicy Tuna'. We were amazed of the quality of the food. It was simply amazing. Spicy Tuna , is by far the best Sushi we have ever had!  We look forward to visiting the Las Vegas area again , and eating at our favorite sushi joint ' Spicy Tuna Sushi'."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town... Everything is always fresh and always delicious. The Danny roll is a must order!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places we've been to here in Vegas - and we've tried quite a few. When we moved to this side of Henderson, we were anxious to find a joint that would meet our sushi needs: tasty, fresh and generously made, without a ridiculous price tag. Spicy Tuna did not disappoint. Consistently great service and great food. Loyal customers!"}
{"text":"They have hands down the best ramen soup ever!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town and the only place I'll go. Their fish is always top quality and everyone is very attentive. Make sure to ask for their spicy ponzu sauce...it's amazing."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in vegas in a long time.. Great service and great casual vibe. I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Horrible misleading cream cheese filled jalapenos 4 come in a menu item. disappointing a sliver to each, not a half as expected like all other sushi restaurants, all batter, no jalapeno and cream cheese. some hardly had cream cheese if at all. misleading as jalapenos filled with cream cheese and battered. all batter. disappointed."}
{"text":"I crave this place on the regular... This has been my best friend and mine's top lunch spot for 7 years. I literally stuff myself until I can't move and then get green tea ice cream to top it off. Not only is every thing fresh, the prices are absolutely reasonable, and the staff is always on point! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone... Best sushi spot, hands down!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in Henderson!  Never disappoints.  Total fav's are the Grand Canyon Roll, Crunchybug Roll, Screaming O and Tijuana Special.  If you love sushi, you will adore Spicy Tuna!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had the lunch special with spicy tuna and teriyaki salmon for an extra $1. It was practically inedible. The lettuce in the salad was old and brown, the salmon teriyaki was old and over cooked and the spicy tuna wasn't spicy and not great either. I wouldn't be leaving this review had the woman who either manages or owns the place was more flexible about the menu and gave better customer service. It was very underwhelming and I left very dissatisfied.  I guess they use all the old food for lunch so PASS on this place."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is the best sushi in Henderson!  Eddie, the owner is a lot of fun and always has a good time with his guests.  The rest of the staff is always friendly and the service is good.  Convenient location too!"}
{"text":"I fly into Vegas about twice a month and always make it a point to have some amazing sushi here. Eddie and his staff are fun and make you feel like family. I have eaten here about 40 times and looking forward to the next 40.  It also happen to be next door to Trader Joe's. The best food store in America!!!"}
{"text":"We stumble across here after shopping next door. Owner was super friendly and made all the sushi for us at the bar. Great value and good sushi. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always so delicious and lots of different rolls to choose from. Love that they offer brown rice as an option.  Screaming orgasm is one if my absolute favorites.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OK, the time has come for me to write a review for Spicy Tuna Sushi. I have been here a handful of times. It is a weird feeling, the wife and I feel bad each and every time, shhhh we are cheating on our regular sushi spot.  However, there is no sense in denying it any longer. Spicy Tuna is our new spot. The spicy, garlic edammame is by far the best in town as is their green tea. We are still trying to figure out our favorite rolls though. We love Burning night Screaming O, Kyle's roll and their Screaming O. We have pretty much gone through the entire menu now and honestly, you can't go wrong. The only knock is that the fish is ice cold when served, not a bad thing since you know they are keeping it on ice, its just a little off putting when you bite into a roll.  Everyone should be trying out this spot, you will catch us their Friday nights!"}
{"text":"Oh my, this place has some awesome sushi and even better employees.  Eddie is great and is there often so say hello!  Gonzo, my fave, is always cherry and makes THE best rolls....by far!  Some, of many, suggestions I can make are:   D's Guys Agadashi Tofu Japanese lasagna Gonzo Roll Kyle Special  Like I said, SOME of MANY!  As an added bonus, they give you what I believe to be sake soaked orange slices.  Perfect for cleaning your pallet after a tasty meal of sushi goodness :-)"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls here are incredible, and the service is excellent. This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and the servers are really friendly too. I usually order the justin roll and orgasm!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! I love that they give you edamame and cucumber salad right when you sit down. The sushi is good and the prices are decent!"}
{"text":"A great place to bring the family!  The staff was always going out of there way to help with an energetic ball of energy grandchild.  And the food!  My son & his family just came from Minnesota, which struggles with the number of quality sushi restaurants.  They were gleefully surprised to find such a good restaurant so close to their new home.  Unique rolls a plenty, the chefs try combinations we never heard of, they do quite a bit of frying & rely heavily on green onions...so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Love the sushi. The sushi burrito is amazing. Sit in Gonzo's section. He is funny and makes the time fly by"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Love the miso soup. It took about 5 or 6 tries of different places to find this place. We take it to go most of the time and it's always ready when they say it will be ready."}
{"text":"Finally a real Japnese sushi place in Las Vegas...yo!. Well actually this ones' been here for a while and is in Henderson  but it just been discovered by me. The place is nice it has semi private booths some tables and the traditional sushi bar, the service is great, the waiters check on you constantly to make sure you don't miss anything, the food?.... well it was kind of pornographic....we ordered the who's your daddy, taste like my x-girlfriend, screaming orgasm and the happy ending. Don't ask me why, since they also have all kinds of normal sushi rolls like princes Deana with orgasm sauce, sex on the beach, the Tijuana express and the Mexican roll, but they just sounded too familiar, like I had them before. Prices are reasonable, you would pay way more for all that at a massage parlor and not leave as happy, so next time you're in the neighborhood make sure to give them a try, you'll be an instant fan....but then who isn't a fan of a good happy ending?...........roll."}
{"text":"All I can say is I am super picky with my sushi after eating it in Japan at the Tsukiji fish market... and this is ORGASMIC!!!  Zero complaints!"}
{"text":"This was bad tuna all round 60 $ of fish  left behind . Nothing offered after telling my waiter fish was poor left on my plate. Bad service bad food"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! Not as good as I Love Sushi, but no wait and just as good of a selection.  I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite local sushi spot. We have been eating here for 3 years and absolutely love it! The service is always awesome - and the food never disappoints. Their crab salad is amazing, and the Mexican and Johnny rolls are a must-try. Also love the 007 roll, and of course if you want to go with a basic roll their shrimp tempura is a slam dunk every time!"}
{"text":"I love that their sushi roll menu is huge and there are many different choices. Their menu is fun and they have almost 100 different rolls and I enjoy reading through each and every one to pick something out!! Hubby and I tried the Jalapeño Lover which are jalapenos stuffed with spicy salmon and cream cheese, then deep fried - they're like jalapeño poppers. Good but probably wouldn't get it again. Also got the Japanese Lasagna which was tasty but have had better elsewhere. The last roll we tried was our favorite; #61 Love Long Time. The roll had shrimp tempura, cucumbers, cream cheese, and salmon, all tossed with avocado, tomatoes, onions and jalapenos. It had all the right textures! We also tried the Bulgoki which was ok. It didn't have a very authentic taste. All in all it was good and if I could give 3 1/2 stars I would but I'm giving them 3 stars because it didn't blow my mind and I'm not sure if I would go there again."}
{"text":"Very decent sushi for the price.  Extremely affordable.  Not the best service, but not terrible either.  Definitely a repeat customer here!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the waitress that was helping us wouldn't even speak. We would thank her and she would just turn around and walk away!!! We tried to be extra nice and everyone had an attitude.   The next time I sat at the sushi bar and had great service so I'm thinking maybe it was an off night or the staff working the first time wasn't friendly. I'm glad to see service isn't bad all the time. Also, they were really fast with my order. It was super simple, but still! They have lunch specials, which I would recommend because if you like to order a little bit of everything, it can add up!  I gave Spicy Tuna 3 stars because the sushi prices are kind of expensive and the service was so bad the first time. This is a great location, right next to Trader Joe's, so I'm sure I will stop in again. If so, I will update my review based on that experience too.  Pros: -Amazing lunch specials -Beef short ribs are delicious  -Fresh!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy my sushi cravings. The fish always taste fresh and the menu keeps the tastebuds wanting more. Aside from the \"creative\" menu item names the food is top notch. Not a traditional take on sushi but definitely one that does it right. The staff provides friendly service and makes you feel welcomed.  The sushi bar has mounted TVs to satiate all the sports fans desires. The booths surrounding the bar provide quieter a option for dates and conversation.  If you are in the area give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. Always fresh tasting, never been sick, and they have some tasty rolls. The only downfall that I find is that many of the rolls are similar and that they use a lot of sauce on top. I always ask for half sauce. Also, I would really like to see more sashimi OR rolls without rice (like a cucumber wrap)."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend for the best lunch special in town.  Two order combination choices of shrimp tempura, BBQ beef, chicken katsu, salmon teriyaki & whole roll of California cut roll including miso soup, salad, rice, egg roll and so many other choices starting at $8.95.    Every Saturday or Sunday we are greeted by JJ and he is so welcoming and knows exactly what kinds of drinks to bring out for us the second we sit down.   Customer service is on point here.  We love bringing friends and family here for lunch or dinner.  Thank you Spicy Tuna for always a great meal and superb service."}
{"text":"One Star for SUSHI ONLY!  It was Sunday for Hells Sake!!  Service was HORRIBLE!  The woman running the joint was condescending and rude!  Not only did we want to order more sushi, we wanted to order more alcohol!  We are normally excellent tippers!  However given the fact we received no refills, no wasabi, no ginger, NO SERVICE = NO TIP!"}
{"text":"Summary: Fifth time here and I can ensure everyone that this is the best Japanese cuisine restaurant to eat Uni. It is so fresh and sweet, no bitterness whatsoever.  Service: Mainly Korean servers, very kind and fast. Sushis all came out within 10 minutes and they pay attention to drinks.   Decor: Nice large TVs for sports viewings. Very open area which is nice and clean. Restrooms and everything is well upkept.  Price: Uni sashimi is 7.95, sushi for 6.95. Great price since it is the same quality or maybe even better than Nobu.   Final comments: Would come every week with girlfriend to get our Uni fix! De-fucking-licious."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST sushi ever. Their staff is amazing too.   Here's a little secret, if you don't feel like going to the restaurant and you'd rather lounge around in pajamas, order it to go (or through Postmates). The food is ALWAYS fresh, hot (if it comes hot) and delicious. We've ordered it through delivery 3 or 4 times and it's always perfect. We even order the D's Guys roll and it still comes delivered to our house as if we were sitting at their table. Nothing is messy or smashed together. Presentation is still perfect. It's amazing!!   All of their food on their menu is good though. I love their Miso soup, teriyaki chicken, all of their crunch rolls and their house dressing. You seriously have to try it! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For years I have been going to the Trader Joe's next door and never popped into Spicy Tuna.   With a rapid change of dinner plans that was changed and I am thankful for that.   Upon entry I was immediately taken back by the spacious interior.  High ceilings and wide open spaces with the sushi bar located in the middle.  Because we were sitting with friends, only a booth would do.  Booths create fellowship.  Sitting shoulder to shoulder in a row at a bar does not facilitate that.  Our server was with smile and shared with the group his favorites including one not on the menu (see tips).  As for the sushi it was fresh and delicious.  If in the area I would happily visit again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Spicy Tuna Sushi but it just wasn't for me.   They were recommended so we stopped here for lunch.  It's between Trader Joe's and Kmart off of Eastern.  The dining room is very large with plenty of bar seating.  I was disappointed that they didn't offer any lunch specials with so many other places that do.  Oh well... I wasn't going to leave.    We tried a few different plates.  The Japanese Lasagna roll was good.  Crab and cream cheese baked with cheese on top.  That was right up my alley.  The Gonzo 2 roll was presented beautifully.  This roll had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber, seared albacore and crispy onion.  With all of those wonderful ingredients it fell short.  Yeah... I was surprised too! Plus it's just too hard to eat.  Most of the inside fell out just trying to pick up one piece.    Oh well.  It was worth a shot."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid non-AYCE joint in Henderson/Anthem area. My husband and I were in the area and I have had this place bookmarked forever, plus it was recently recommended by Matt S, so deciding where to have early dinner was no brainer.  We started with a couple of (underwhelming) appetizers: Calamari Tempura and Bacon Maki. I was not impressed with either selection and let my husband finish both. The calamari was 90% scrape-the-roof-of-your-mouth-raw tempura with a small chewy bit of octopus. Bacon Maki was scallop wrapped in bacon - I mean I am a fan of anything wrapped in bacon, but this combo didn't work for me. The bacon tasted rubbery, old and microwaved.   We ordered salmon nigiri and scallop nigiri and both were fantastic. The cuts of fish were quite large on a tiny bed of rice, and most importantly, they were fresh.  We ordered 3 rolls of sushi as I typically like to balance out my rolls. I generally opt for a havier baked roll, a spicy roll, and a very simple and fresh roll. We went with:  Sun Devil Roll Smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, ebi, spicy crab, sliced jalapeno, served w/ yum yum  (4/5)  Rainbow Roll Fresh tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, halibut on top of california roll (5/5)  Kiss of Fire W/ Extra Spicy Sauce Shrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, albacore (4/5)  We topped it off with two orders of mochi.  The total pre tip was ~$70 and based on the portion and quality of the fish, it was well worth the money.   The interior is spacious and clean, and appears to have the neighborhood appeal judging by some of the regulars that were there. The service was friendly and accomodating.  I would both recommend this place to others and come back myself."}
{"text":"Let me get mathematical on you for a minute. If salmon + crab = awesome, and tomato + avocado = delicious, then adding shredded radish and applying ponzu sauce via the distributive property equals the phenomenal JUSTIN SPECIAL! Shout out to the supporting ingredients: furikake, sesame seeds, and scallions. Okay that last part was theater, not math, but whatever.  TLDR: Get the Justin Special, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Dr. Jason Roll, Joe's Special, Katie and Lo and Japanese Lasagna and the cucumber salad are my faves!! Try them... you won't regret it! Eddie and his team there are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi joint I have found in Vegas. Everything is fresh and amazing. Lunch special is 10 bucks and you get a ton of food. Definitely worth every penny. I rarely eat out and when I'm looking for somewhere nice, this is first on the list. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm not much of a sashimi guy, so I stuck to the rolls, but everything was top notch. We had California, Philadelphia, spicy shrimp, Mexican, and the Vegas 51 rolls and were impressed with all. The Mexican is great if you like a little spicy bite, and the Vegas was a great tempura roll. Check this joint out for sure!"}
{"text":"Every time we've been here, the service has been fantastic. The staff is so friendly which makes the entire dining experience so great. You really can't go wrong with any of the rolls. D's Guy Special and the Kiss of Fire rolls are particularly delicious. It's an awesome neighborhood spot, great servers and staff."}
{"text":"Found this place by total chance. Went to I love sushi up the street which had at least an hour if not more wait... so I yelped sushi and found this place! I would DEFINITELY come back. Very quick and friendly service.  The food was very good as well.  The dr. Jason was huge and delicious.  But the Jamie abd Elle I think it's called was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Best sush joint in town - strip or off strip...lots of creative rolls and specials.  The owner - Eddie - is the best host in town.  Fun atomosphere, good for kids, dates, relaxing, etc...Eddie will remember your name if you are a repeat customer at the sushi bar.    Sushi is good quality, fish cuts may be a bit on the slim side for sushi/sashimi but the maki rolls are the winners here...I'm hooked on the Deez Guyz and Justin Special rolls...get adventurous and try them all!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi spot! This place is awesome! They have over 90 different rolls with funny names. The quality of the sushi is good and the service is very attentive. They have a few flat screens in there with sports playing to. I get the Yum Yum hand roll everytime! You wont be dissapointed with Spicy Tuna!"}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna provides high quality sushi at a fair affordable price. The menu is very diverse offering 92 various options of sushi. My favorite is \"D's Guy Special\" and the orgasm sauce is mouth watering good. Damon is very personable and nonetheless a talented chef who prepares sushi in the best way possible. I recommend Damon as the chef for anyone who walks into this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars The rolls while good rely on over saucing and the use of putting as many ingredients in them as possible to make them more...exciting? I guess.  Sometimes I just want a simple roll that has amazing tasting seafood in it, not amazing sauce. Maybe thats just me though.  Anyway, the pictures already posted here are a good representation of type of sushi rolls that that are made here.   By the way they have brown rice available upon request.    I didn't have any problem with the service. I sat at the sushi bar and the  sushi chefs were friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Really great sushi place.   Fresh fish, great staff, and the give you free edamame!!  Try the screaming O (it's great!)"}
{"text":"The sushi here is really good, but the service is even better.  I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff is.  I'm just sad this place is so far from my house!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and lots of variety! The chefs are super friendly and the location is good. Haven't been here in a while but we will go here again for sure.  I always get tuna but it was fun to try some new rolls.  The chefs are nice and can suggest new things."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have gone back several times. Service has improved and the food has been fantastic! I tell everyone now about this Sushi spot."}
{"text":"Oh my this is the best place. They have a huge assortment of Sushi with and without rice. They also have a great full menu with lots of options. Lunch specials are amazing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place for sure. Every time I go somewhere else I think to myself \"I wish I'd gone to Spicy Tuna instead\". Their rolls are amazing and Eddie and Gonzo are a riot to talk to. Get a Crunchbug Special, a D's Guy, or a Dr. Jason Special."}
{"text":"I Love...Spicy Tuna! ;-) anything with a spice is my absolute favorite...Mexican roll, kiss of fire, and jalapeño sashimi! The chicken and beef teriyaki is actually pretty good, too. They serve edamame and a yummy cucumber salad for free, which is a great snack while I try and pretend like I'm going to get something new...why break what doesn't need to be fixed, right? ;-)   The staff is great and luckily we never have to wait too long for food...which is probably why my husband takes me here when I'm hangry now that I think about it...anyways, hope you enjoy my favorite sushi spot!!!"}
{"text":"i always get the take out lunch special and it's so yummy, the meal is cheap and they're very generous with it; i never finish the whole thing. they're always so nice and i went to din- in one time and the service is really good  try the bulgoki"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and highly recommend it. The staff if friendly and the sushi is awesome! They have a special roll call the \"Ting\". It isn't on the menu but it is worth getting."}
{"text":"There are so many sushi places on Eastern, but Spicy Tuna is definitely worth a try! The service is great, and everything is pretty fresh. With that said, I love their fried soft-shell crab probably the best."}
{"text":"Their screaming orgasm is so good! I like how it comes in a small size and a large size, depending on how hungry I may or may not be sometimes. I would give it a 5 stars for food quality and customer service, but their restrooms were awfully dirty the few times I ate here. Kinda grossed me out."}
{"text":"We ended up here after finding out our favorite sushi place had over an hour wait. So we thought we would give them a try. Wish they offered all you can eat. Ended up ordering the beef teriyaki dinner special w tempura shrimp and vegetable. The tempura fell very short, no crunch, no crisp. More like it was made in the microwave, limp. Teriyaki was ok but way to much sauce. Food was ok but there was probably a reason why there was only 2 other parties in the restaurant at the time. Friends were not impressed. Next time we think the hour wait would be better worth it at our fave place."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh sushi!! The staff were friendly and funny! Will def be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place in town for sushi. It is hard for me to go to other sushi spots because I always compare it to Spicy Tuna. Nothing beats that place! The Grand Canyon Roll is the best item on the menu and the complimentary cucumber salad is great. Also, when sitting at the bar the chefs are great to chat with! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Before Spicy Tuna, I was not a fan of sushi. It was okay, but nothing I craved. Now, I wake up craving the Grand Canyon - the mother of all sushi rolls. It's like amazing in your mouth.  If you can, request Jake as your server. He knows all of the millions of rolls available and is an expert waiter.  If you can dream it, it's on the menu. The only hard part is making a decision!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi spot in the area. Went in around 6:30 and was promptly seated and waters delivered which is a must in this heat  Any who, I'm basic so we started off with Spicy Tuna and D's Guys special which was amazing!  Great experience and definitely making this my \"Sushi Sunday's\" spot"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town!!!  And probably my favorite food spot of all times! Could eat there every day. The specialty rolls are delicious and the service is friendly and professional.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I REALLY love sushi; it's probably my favorite cuisine. My favorite sushi place in Las Vegas is, without a doubt, Spicy Tuna. (My second fav is I Love Sushi just south of this place.) It's a good atmosphere, for sure, but the sushi chefs make the scene. Some of them are just downright hilarious, and they sure seem to work together well. The Salmon is exceptional and the sushi is very high grade. Prices are standard, the roll list is anything but.  FAVORITE ROLL EVER: The Thing Roll with Carrot on top This roll is exceptional. It's a soft shell crab roll with loads of fixins, topped with fried shredded carrot (instead of the mushroom straws they put on the standard Thing.) It has it's own special sauce that's kinda spicy and definitely sweet. MMMMMM!!! It's a BIG roll, especially with the pile of carrots on it."}
{"text":"GREAT!!! All around! We came in 30 minutes before closing typically anywhere you go you feel rushed around closing time. Our server was great super welcoming and continued to serve us with patients. He never made us feel rushed, he checked up on us always at the right time.   The rolls where very different well worth it! We will definitely be back here! I'm glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Every time I come back to Vegas I go out of my way just to eat here. The types of things they have on their menu is like nothing you have ever tried. Always satisfiedgood hangover food too"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite local sushi spot in town.  Albeit I've moved to summerlin I still come here whenever I'm in Hendo.  The rolls are diverse and always the freshest fish.  The service is on point and I just enjoy the mellow location.  Another sushi place up the street from here always rushes us out after eating.  Spicy supports the environment of chilling with friends and eating until our hearts content.   The best."}
{"text":"just tried this place! had two rolls and a dinner special box. the rolls are sooooo good! I tried kiss of fire and the no-rice roll that's four different fish in soy paper. I forgot the name.   also the 2-piece sushi orders - the quality of fish is so great!   also tried hot sake and the cold lemon sake. I never really like cold sake but this one was really good.   also can't go wrong with mochi for dessert! shared green tea, mango, strawberry, and red bean with my friends!"}
{"text":"If only you could give out 10 starts, i think i would still have to give this place 11!! :)  I never knew shshi could be this good!!!! Located on Eastern and Coranado, next to Trader Joe's, this is the place to go for sushi and also a good time! The owner Eddie pratically lives there... I think he has a matterss in the back somewhere. He is ALWAYS there which is awesome cause that means you can go anyday you want at any time and you will have the best sushi chef there to create the most amazing fish you have ever had.  The rolls are inventive and delicious. Eddie needs to sign up for a \"how fast can you make sushi contest\" cause im telling you he would totally WIN!! Almost before you can tell him what it is you want he is handing it to you!   I feel that part of the sushi experience is sitting at the bar and talking with the sushi chef. I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!  This place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \"yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro!   If you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go! Just make sure you dont already have dinner plans for the night after, cause i guarentee you that you will want to go back again!!   Thank you Eddie, for bring to Henderson the best sushi EVER!! You are the MAN!!!!   oh, and after writting this and thinking about it, im sure ill see you in a few hours.. lol   (pictures posted)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've tried all the local spots and this one is the greatest, hands down. Customer service is second to none. The staff all greeted us when we walked in and thanked us when we left. Excellent with kids.   I've been eating sushi for a long time and my wife and I agree we had the most delicious  rolls ever. Everyone needs to try the Ds roll.   Thank you spicy tuna you guys deserve 6 stars."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and funny. The food was good as well. I ordered the Hamachi Kama and was burned -1 star and they tried to mask the flavor with lemon. They did this also to the Saba. Fresh fish really doesn't need lemon. I ordered Salmon Skin cut roll It was ok ... Not the best but not bad either ... nothing was standing out for me ... i didn't even bother to take photo's the place. The lighting was poor music too loud and bunch of plasma screens to watch sports. My wife order tempura and Udon. It was ok. I tried my sons chicken it was quite good. I ordered the a roll d's something it was really good. This place is more like fusion maki sushi ... if you like fusion maki sushi you need to come here. If they didn't burn my hamachi kama would be a 4 Star. The service is good, food is good, but when i got my bill ... it wasn't that good. Give it a try ... i will come back in a month and try it again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Never fails to make my taste buds happy. It's called the D Guy Special. I come here every time just to have this roll. Customer service is absolutely amazing as well. Great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Update: I brought my parents here, and while mom is still freaked out by anything sushi, refusing to listen that not all sushi means raw fish, she was hell bent on getting chicken. She ordered the chicken katsu meal and LOVED IT! Best fried chicken she's had she said!  Dad, was the adventurous one and had a 007 roll, and I ordered another for us to try and shockingly enough, he ate his first piece of raw tuna...loved it!  We took a copy of the menu so when he goes back to Florida, they understand the lingo and what rolls he would like. Lol I love them.    Will definitely be back w/ my brother and sister-in-law when they come to visit!    Service is still A++++"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes YASSS!!!! I am a self proclaimed sushi Snob from LA and this place is around the corner from us here in Henderson and it was great. Fresh fish, great rolls, fabulous sashimi, yummy shooters! And Gonzo, he's the man! Pricing was great too we had sake, beers, salmon and halibut sushi, garlic albacore, yellowtail carpaccio with jalapeños, princess deana roll, jay sp (I think; it's crispy rice cake w. Spicy tuna), quail egg shooter, Uni shooter, shrimp tempura...I'm sure I may be missing one or two things all for just shy of $100. And customer Service was on point. Highly recommend. I was too busy eating to take pics of everything but posted a couple."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come for sushi. The waitress is super sweet, sushi chefs are friendly, food is excellent. I just finished my complimentary sliced orange they give you for dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!! You can't go wrong with a hulk roll. My favorite roll that had a little kick and crunch to it. Great service as well."}
{"text":"OnOrdered tiger roll #64  to go for quick lunch. It was fresh and didn't disappoint. Will be back"}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is a solid option for Sushi! Great rolls, big cuts of sashimi. Nice local spot for those looking to get off the strip.  This place is probably my second favorite sushi spot, probably because they have almost identical menus to my favorite sushi spot. I still will always take the extra 5 minute drive to go up the street to I Love Sushi - It has better quality fish, better rolls, better staff, better ambiance.   Spicy Tuna has a few unique sushi rolls when compared to 'I Love Sushi', like D's Guy Roll, Gonzo 2, and the Ting. I feel if they added a few more unique rolls to their menu - I might stop by here again.   Still a good second option to go for Sushi off the strip."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi place!! Can't get enough of the Justin's special!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives:  1. Service-- Excellent! My drink was refilled, and my dirty plates were cleared off instantly. 2. Clean restaurant, and nicely decorated.  3. *****BONUS**** - 2 flat screen televisions were on during dinner-showing the NBA finals. 4. Sushi roll was good (my wife and I go with the cucumber rolls w/ avocado). This is a good option for those who really don't like seafood all that much.  Negatives:  1. The salad which is part of the 2-item dinner special had way too much dressing on it.  2. The bulgoki beef was disappointing. The flavor was ok, but the beef itself was a little soggy and fatty.  From my experience, there are better sushi places in the area. I love Sushi, and Momo sushi come to mind."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place we will go to in Vegas!  I used to be a fan of I Love sushi prior to finding this gem, but I never found the staff to be friendly.  Spicy Tuna has great service and amazing food!!   If you like fresh healthy options, get the Justin Special! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best sushi place I have ever been too! I have been to many great sushi restaurants but this place has the most unique rolls i have ever seen. I highly recommend trying the D's guy roll. If you try this place they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this sushi spot. It is my families favorite. The service is great and the sushi is top notch. My daughter and I usually share the JACKPOT and Bonzai with Edeamame. My husband and son usually go with hand-rolls and sashimi. Highly recommend to everyone I know"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Vegas area. I drive all the way across town just to eat here. All other sushi restaurants are disappointing in comparison!"}
{"text":"What to say...I used to go to I love sushi all the time until my friend brought me to spicy tuna! Best sushi of my life!!! I go there once a week or even twice I've tried many sushi restaurants before but none of them have the service, food and overall atmosphere spicy tuna has! Eddi is amazing, very friendly and prompt wt my order he always starts me off with the complimentary cucumber salad and edamame, I always order the double d roll which is my favorite and he makes the exception to make it mild for me since I don't like my food spicy, Ryan roll and the crunchbug is good as well and at the end they always finish off with a complimentary orange or icecream for the price it's so worth it!....everyone there is very friendly and funny as well, unfortunately I moved to LA so I don't get to eat there as often u can even imagine how many times I've craved their sushi! Every time I'm in vegas I make time to visit and enjoy some real sushi!  Always and forever ur faithful customer aka miss double d!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and service is good.  Only complaint was that the  crab meat they use is not real crab meat. I ordered the Crab Salad- Sliced cucumber crab meat, kaiware, furikake, in house dressing. It says \"crab meat\" on the menu.  Imitation crab is made with a type of fish called surimi. Manufacturers add fillers, flavoring and color to surimi to mimic the taste, texture and color of real crab legs. Imitation crab meat is a versatile ingredient that costs far less than the real thing. These imitation crab sticks are high in sodium and the nutritional value is not as good as real crab meat. Just be honest with ingredients."}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars for multiple reasons.   1. One I have been following Eddy around town for 20 years now and he never disappoints.   2. They have my favorite sushi roll in the city (D's Guy Roll)  3. There are many kinds of sushi joints from high end to low end crap. This place is quality fish, put together in fun original rolls with a focus on quality and value.   If you are look my for a local neighborhood owner operated gem check this place out. I drove from downtown to Henderson just for this place monthly.   That's the D's Guy Roll In the background.  My Rating Scale 5 Stars - Would go back weekly 4 stars - Would go back monthly 3 stars - Only going back if friends wanted to go 2 stars - Will not go back at all 1 star - Will probably go out of business soon"}
{"text":"4 1/2 star review.  We actually stumbled upon this place while running errands on this side of town and I'm sure glad we did. Their specialty sushi roll menu was extensive....maybe like close to 90 something rolls to choose from. Kinda overwhelmed by that haha.  We ordered: -spicy tuna roll -Andrew Roll-soft shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, super white tuna, mustard sauce -Double D-shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, spicy salmon with avocado on top.   These are pretty good sized rolls too so between the two of us, sharing three orders got us pretty full. Specialty rolls can range from $8-14. Definitely will be back. There were soooooo many other rolls we would like to try."}
{"text":"After 15 years of loyal patronage to I Love Sushi, it seems as though the tide has turned down Eastern a bit to a newer strip mall sushi joint, Spicy Tuna. I had heard good things from friends and family, so my parents and I decided to stop in for an early dinner around 5pm last week. There were only two other tables occupied, so I knew service was going to be great BUT instead, it took about 15 minutes to get a glass of water and give someone our drink order. Yikes. The food quality however, made up for it! Quickly too, for our table was packed with sushi and appetizers in a matter of minutes.   We started with the bacon maki, wrapped in scallops which was alright, a little chewy for my taste. The Arizona roll which I thought was by far the best, fresh salmon and avocado which I garnished with thinly sliced lemon. Superb!  A HUGE portion of steaming yaki soba which was honestly the sweetest surprise of the whole meal. The flavors were so rich and sweet but not cloying and the vegetables tender and plentiful. Made for great leftovers too!   Other sushi highlights were the D's roll, which was piled high with \"cones\" of spicy tuna mixture that looked like hats or some sort of whirling dervish, and the Kyle's special which was also another little saucy number, topped with a variety of fresh fish: albacore, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp.   Filling, flavorful, and FRESH."}
{"text":"This is my fave sushi place in town. The atmosphere is nice, service varies but the selection is great. They are the best ones for some healthy options. The Bar roll and the Screaming orgasm both don't have rice and are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had. We come back to Vegas once a year for training and make the drive to Henderson just for this sushi."}
{"text":"Kelly D - what a DELICIOUS roll!  We do like it here.  The staff seems a bit new and you can get the incorrect items at times, but it is all very good!"}
{"text":"I can't put into words how amazing this place is. GET THE SCREAMING O... Just do it.  By far hands down my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. The staff treats us like family, the food is to die for, and its pretty mello on weekdays and lunch. The cucumber salad is also amazing."}
{"text":"Don't judge this restaurant by it's un-creative name. The food is pretty good especially the rolls and there are MANY to chose from. The bento boxes are the most elaborate you'll probably find. It's good food and will be one of our eat in/take out places while we're here in Vegas.   Btw, friendly staff and good wasabi wings ;)."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and GREAT service. Honestly, so much better than 'I Love Sushi' near by - - in every sense.  Thank you 'Spicy Tuna Sushi', we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"After a bad experience down the road at another sushi place we wound up here, my first taste of sushi and I LOVED it, the service was excellent, they catered to the fact that my daughter had allergies and it was a wonderful evening, we are going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Still the best after all these years!!! If you haven't had Gonzo make you one of his specialty rolls and you love sushi then your life isn't complete!!!"}
{"text":"This is quiet place off of Eastern right next to Trader Joes.  The staff is very nice and the food is great.  Try the D's Guys roll, which I believe to be their best roll.  They are open late."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you do not want to do all you can eat. My friends love coming here and being my first time I was skeptical because I am picky about my sushi. They have a wide variety of unique rolls. I was adventurous and had the sun devil roll and that was delicious! The sauce that comes with it was yummy! Service was great. Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends for late lunch.  Being Sunday it was quiet and allowed us to ask questions and receive quick service.  My girlfriends ordered rolls and sashimi which were reported to be awesome.  I had spicy fried tofu with a side of rice.  Being a vegetarian it can be hard to find items on the menu.  This did not disappoint. Perfectly breaded and seasoned.  I'll definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I usually stick to one and only one sushi place but this is near my work so I decided to call in an order.. I got dynamite and it was amazing!! Unlike any before. A bit pricey but defiantly worth it!!"}
{"text":"I just visited this place for the first time last night and it was the best restaurant experience I've ever had. First, the food was incredible. It was well put together, high quality ingredients, and delicious. The portions were very generous as well, I was surprised to find. Second, the staff was incredibly kind to the people at my table. One waiter in particular, JJ, was especially entertaining and inviting. I felt very comfortable and welcomed here. I highly recommend this place to any sushi lover with a good appetite. Thank you to the staff, and the owner Eddie, for the perfect restaurant experience! I'll be returning very soon."}
{"text":"So wife and I went here for our sushi fix on Thursday on a late lunch. We got in about 230 pm. The restaurant closes at 3 pm and opens up a few hours later for dinner. We sat right away and ordered immediately. No \"all you can eat\" but that's not why we came. You might want to go to Sushi-Mon (on Maryland Pkwy) or Yama Sushi (on Flamingo Rd) if you want \"that.\" When I say \"that,\" I mean a little more rice and little less seafood in the serving; notice that they never have sashimi on the AYCE menu?  So here we had Cajun Albacore (nigiri), Spicy California roll, Spicy Yellowtail, Spicy Tuna Roll, Masago Roll with Quail egg and a Ryan Special.  Delicious. Afterwards, we were given a little bowl of fresh cut orange to round out our palette. You need to eat sushi here if your a fan of fresh seafood, a clean environment and friendly staff. Prices are decent too. Not that inflated amount you would pay if you dined at a hotel sushi restaurant.  Eddie served us and was attentive, knowledgeable, and funny. Did I mention he's the owner? (I can respect an owner involved and invested in his craft, especially when he's good at what he does.)  I asked him what day(s) of the week he gets fresh fish. He said \"every day!\"  He wasn't exaggerating because you can really taste it in the flavor and texture of his products. Give it a shot, this is one of Las Vegas's (Henderson) sure bets!"}
{"text":"Eddie makes the best sushi and always greats us when we arrive.  He remembers details about our family and makes us feel welcome.  The food is amazing and great prices for sushi!"}
{"text":"Absolutely out of this world - The rolls are the best I've had anywhere.  Our favorite Sushi restaurant by a long shot.  Friendly staff - can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"For a Saturday night (6:30pm), the place was practicing empty. That should have been the first clue for a rocky night.  The food was ok, nothing exceptional. Wasabi was pasty and the shrimp tempura was chewy. The staff couldn't clean up the table fast enough. ..as if they wanted to go home early. At least 5 different staff stopped by a few times each to ask how things were. To top the night off,  the pen accompanied the bill was taped to a dirty plastic spoon....not going to plan on returning."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, and I found out they make some Korean .  Next time I will try that out if it is good I may bump it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am not giving a 3 star rating because of the food which was excellent but the service we received on a weeknight was less than desirable.  We got in before 9:00 pm on a Wednesday night.  The joint was not crowded.  The food we ordered was excellent but we were given the tab half way through our meal.  Not only that, no refill for our teas or even asked if we wanted refills. I would have ordered another beer for my meal but no server was around to ask after we got the tab.  I thought this joint is our choice for fine Japanese dining????"}
{"text":"Great sushi. I would rank it up there with I love sushi. Chili garlic edamame, crunch roll add cream cheese and jay special is the usual got to."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The sushi was a little pricy but fresh. I had the lunch special and it was awesome. Good quick spot for lunch"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot ever if you go to Nevada got to go and try it I've been going here since 2009 can't visit Nevada without going to spicy tuna what's up Eddie"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch this afternoon. I was very impressed with the quality. The salmon sushi with garlic sauce was my favorite. Everything was delicious. My co-worker had a few rolls and they looked like large size portions. Desert was awesome too. Glad I finally got to try this spot. Definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers. Great service. A+"}
{"text":"At my office this place has become a favorite lunch location. I really enjoy their sashimi salad with orgasm sauce...Great portions and YUMMY"}
{"text":"If you want phenomenal sushi and the best staff around, Spicy Tuna is your spot. I have never had a bad meal here. Order the Justin Roll, the Double D, or the Lisa Hand Roll if you want to impress your date. This place is a can't miss, and once you meet the staff, you won't want to ever leave. Hopefully, you'll get Eddie(owner), or Gonzo to make your rolls, and David to be your server. He'll keep you laughing all night. I can't say enough good things about this place. JUST TRY IT!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Sushi spot. It's not all you can eat but the rolls are huge!  I usually get the We Love Longtime and that's definitely all I need. The sushi chefs are super friendly.  If you're looking for quality and not just an all you can eat restaurant you gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"It seems i have finally found a decent sushi place that is not in a casino or ridiculously over priced! YES!   Service was prompt and polite, definitely 5 stars there. The location is easy to find and i was surprised at how large the actual inside was. I like how the tables are separated by walls so you get kind of a private intimate feeling. The decor was fun and so were the spoon pens. The staff were pleasant and clearly having a good time. the sushi chefs were clearly enjoying themselves and having fun interacting with guess who were sitting at the bar.   Food was excellent. I ordered a spider roll, a tuna cut roll, and steamed mussels and my friend ordered the yuppee roll (not sure on the spelling but it was similar to that). Everything was A+ and tasted so delicious and fresh. Definitely coming back to try more of their rolls, they have sooo many special rolls i couldnt even read through them all but some of the names and descriptions gave me a good laugh. Yay!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I love Sushi was my favorite Sushi place in Las Vegas until Eddie left there and opened his own place called Spicy Tuna. You absolutely can not find better quality sushi in all of Las Vegas/Henderson. Eddie, the owner and head chef is always there and he is also the same chef responsible for creating the menus for Encore's sushi restaurant as well. His sauces are sensational and creations are unmatched. The atmosphere at Spicy Tuna is not quite as nice as I Love Sushi though. Spicy is more like a sports bar type feel Bright, TV screens with sports playing, kind of cheesy decor. You just don't get that same cozy dining feel that you may hope for on a Friday or Saturday night with your girl. I really wish Eddie would change the style of the place but you still cant match the fish quality and when your looking for good sushi that really is all that matters. I give this place my highest rating still! Favorite dishes are Sex on the Beach (Garlic Ponzu) & 51 Vegas Special (Deep Fried special that Eddie created for I Love Sushi and it's not on his menu but ask for it because its 10x better at Spicy)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent. My mother and I ran across traffic on Eastern to get there (my car was getting work done at Jiffy Lube), so I walked in that door needing some awesome sushi and a beer.  They definitely provided that :) I actually did have the \"spicy tuna,\" and I loved how they stuffed so much of the tuna in the roll. It was amazing.   The food came super quick, and the server/host checked on us frequently.  My only issue was no happy hour :( I was expecting some kind of happy hour menu, since it was the middle of the day on a Thursday. If they did have one, no one brought it up to us and I didn't see any happy hour prices listed."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food. The atmosphere is welcoming and very friendly. I really enjoyed the Rock N Roll plate."}
{"text":"I walk in on a Friday night around 9:30..I definitely expected it to be crowded but it wasn't! Nonetheless, I've been here several times and the sushi and salads are yummy. Tonight, the waiters were extra friendly and kept me company while I was having dinner alone. Great food and some of the nicest chefs/waiters. Try the Mike Special roll!"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi, so good!!! Service was also good. The Love heart is spectacular and a must have. The screaming O and TTing are very tasty rolls as well."}
{"text":"We told each other (2 friends and I) that we weren't going to stuff our faces and obviously we were lying to ourselves. Spicy Tuna does not offer AYCE but they offer a great selection of rolls and for whatever reason, they also have GIGANTIC rolls. I'm not complaining, I was just amazed at how humongous the rolls we got were. One piece of the roll could not fit my mouth even though I tried multiple times. It doesn't hurt that the staff is very friendly and hilarious signage is posted (see my posted photos).  So here's what we ate... Complimentary appetizer: I love that they give edamame and cucumber salad without even asking. That's very sweet of Spicy Tuna and made me feel all warm inside, not literally though.  Appetizer: When we got the small screaming o salad, I was in awe of the portion. It was enough for 4 or 5 people as an appetizer. We also got the garlic edamame and it was delectable and highly addicting.  Rolls: My friend ordered the Amazing David that is no longer on the menu. The name is so intriguing and mysterious, no? We also ordered the Kiss of Fire and the Gonzo. All of them were huge and hugely yummy and I wanted to devour every single piece of sushi. The nice thing about a la carte is that you bring all the leftover food home.  Oh wait... we didn't stop there. We also got the tempura green tea ice cream. It did not disappoint in all its deep fried, green and creamy goodness.  I honestly can't wait to come back here! They know how to do a customer right."}
{"text":"It's everything that the other reviews have mentioned. Personalized, enthusiastic service, great sushi, etc... Eddie was the sushi master at I Love Sushi for many years before transitioning to other restaurants and then establishing his own. So, the owner is on the premises and cares very much about his patrons and how they are being served.   Only peripheral complaint is the uninspired decor and the \"top 10\" equally uninspired music. Oh, the 3 flatscreens also ensure that this will never become a cozy, romantic, high end restaurant. Casual sushi still has its place though..."}
{"text":"I don't go to I love Sushi anymore... There's no reason to... This place is MUCH BETTER... Eddie is an awesome sushi chef, and this place offers nearly the same rolls as \"I love\", but done better..  Like: Prettier, tastier, fresher, and there's never a long wait.  Hands down best place in town.."}
{"text":"D's Guys roll was so yummy. Atmosphere, service, and food was all great. Competes with my usual sushi restaurants just fine :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Maybe I demand more from a Sushi restaurant. We had the lunch special if you like rice in your rolls and grease tasting fried food this is the place for you. I definitely will not be back and I can't believe of the 4 1/2 star rating. Bob"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas! Every room tastes different, there are so many good options but my favorite work have to be D's Guy. Everything is so fresh and tasty. You won't find another sushi restaurant like this in town, it's my absolute MY FAVORITE! #wishicouldgiveit10stars"}
{"text":"If you really know quality fish, you will think it's good, but nothing great.  This place is more of a roll place than traditional sushi.  I did think my roll was very good."}
{"text":"We LOVE sushi and this restaurant really has fresh and tasty food.  There must be 1000 sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and it is overwhelming sometimes and difficult to choose.  For the price - this long narrow hallway of an ultimately large restaurant has exactly what you want if you are craving for fresh (non-fishy) sushi.  It may not be something the kids will get excited about - but if you have a chance to get there with the adults in your life - you will enjoy the atmosphere, the food and the prices."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Spicy Tuna for years. Food is usually good and service as well. The last time we went was about 1 month ago on a Saturday night. We got there at 10:00 p.m. and was greeted by the host which told us that it was last call. We said fine no problem we know what we wanted. A chef then proceeds to tell us that we couldn't eat there. I don't know the chef name. I do know he was the only white chef there. Hopefully that doesn't sound racist but that's the only description I remember. My 6 yr old nephew ask me why couldn't we eat there. I told him I didn't know. I understand that the restaurant closes at 10:30 but I though they should have served us. But Thank god I love Sushi was open! The service was absolutely great and the food as well!"}
{"text":"Not impressed!  Came here for dinner one night and the whole experience was below mediocre. The food was ok, we ordered alot of food and the dishes were all mediocre, or not good at all. The Ono (white tuna) sushi $4.45 and yellowtail sushi $4.55 each order was stringy, and stiff, definitely lacking in freshness. We also ordered 2 pieces of fresh water eel, and the 1st time they came out, it was completely burnt and charred. I had to return them and get them to make us a new order. We also ordered gyoza $5.25 and those had really thick skin and overly fried, no flavor at all. We ordered several rolls to share as well, and all 3 were very pricey and mediocre in taste.   The service was decent, but I had to call for service, no one actively came and asked us how we were doing.   We spent over $100 before tax and tips between the 2 of us, and we could have gotten a better meal at an AYCE place. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"This is usually my go to sushi place, but today I ordered the udon noodles with tempura and as I was biting into the tempura onion ring I noticed MOLD in the breading. Everything else was fine except this. I stopped eating my whole meal after seeing this."}
{"text":"Great food!  My friend invited me to this place, it was SO FAR!!  I came all the way from Summerlin.  Food and service was awesome!  I would definitely drive down again."}
{"text":"This is my brothers favorite sushi spot in Vegas.  All the rolls are very tasty and have a lot of combined flavors for any palette. Rolls to get, D's guys , garlic edemame , Gonzo roll,  screaming O roll, Jay's special roll are a few of my choices.  Oh man for sake strawberry nigori. Excellent pairing for sushi"}
{"text":"This is a good place if you are hankering for some good sushi. The main sushi chef is an old Japanese guy who makes great rolls and cuts great sashimi. Their fish here is fresh and good. The pricing is a little much for me, but you get quality, which isn't always easy to find when you don't live next to the ocean.   Would I come back here? Yes. Would I recommend this place to others? Yes."}
{"text":"My friend who lives in Henderson recommended this place so we decided to go. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and off we went to our table place is nicely put together the wait staff was on point. The sushi was really good we had an array of rolls. Also had the ice cream which was good as well.   Sure I'll be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! A little on the pricey side, but well worth it. Amazing fresh sushi, excellent staff & wonderful ambiance. We highly enjoy & recommend the Dees Guys roll, Ashley Roll, & Joes Roll. Of course paired with hot saki :) you won't be disappointed in this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must!!   This spot was something that we've been looking for.  I love sushi and it's hard to find a restaurant that can satisfy both our tastes; quality and quantity. LOL  Spicy tuna has delicious, fresh sushi.. great atmosphere, and a amazing chef who likes to keep you smiling; Eddy--hilarious dude. Who also owns the place. ;] Try it, you might just like it!     Thanks Eddy!  We'll be back for more.. Joanne"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST sushi in Vegas. My boyfriend and I go here at least 2X a week it's that good!  Everything I'd do fresh with a ton of flavor! You get a lot for your money's worth. The staff is the friendliest most inviting people! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place totally hits the spot when I need a good sushi binge. The fish is always fresh and they don't put a great deal of rice like other places do. The chefs really take pride in making their dishes look and taste great here. The sushi burrito is a must have. The ashley, sex on the beach, and kyle rolls are my top faves."}
{"text":"This place is the ISH!! I am a regular at this sushi joint for multiple reasons but the top reason I always crave and return here is the sushi is out of this world amazing!  Whenever I have any clients around this area or friends in town from out of state - This is THE spot I take them for grub and now I even have people requesting we go whenever they are in town.    The bites are HUGE and the rolls are filling.(This is why a lot of fellas take dates there to get an idea of how big their mouth opens if you know what I mean!) I love spicy food!  The Kiss of Fire and NRES specials are two of my favorite.  Most days when i go in with a craving I tell Eddie or Gonzo what i want and they create some fabulous monstrous roll which I inhale with pure satisfaction EVERY time!    The service staff and the sushi chefs are all wonderful!  This place is by far the best sushi in town.  Do not  pass by this place for another joint.  This is not an \"All You Can Eat\" place and the rolls range up to $15 but most are around $11-$13 ish. You will be super full off less rolls because of the larger size of the rolls.    If you are a sake drinker...Try the Raspberry Sake - It is a cold and sweet yet sour and so very delicious sake! The chef will even do a little sake bomb with you too!   This place is very fun and casual! It is not a fancy place but the food is will one up and top any other place you have been!    Anyways...quit reading and start munching!  Geez...Now I am craving some of the rolls from Spicy Tuna! I think all of this food review is working up an appetite for me, maybe I will see you there some time!  You can try one of my special creations if you mention my name or just look on the menu! Enjoy! Arigato!"}
{"text":"A group of us decided to try Spicy Tuna on a recent Saturday evening due to the great Yelp reviews. We had 6.5 people in our group (4 adults, two kids, one baby), it seemed like they were unprepared for a group of more then 4...  we were seated at two tables that were pushed together and it still felt like we needed more room...   The complimentary edamame and cucumber salads that were brought out were a nice gesture, I would have appreciated water coming out first though. We made up for it by doing sake bombs, which made a bit of a mess (please get some smaller glasses, Spicy Tuna management!!)  As others have stated, this is more of a roll place... I still love well made rolls. The menu was a little intimidating, they have 86 'specialty rolls' listed so it took us a while to decide.  We finally agreed to start with:   Large Screaming Orgasm - Generous portion of seared tuna but I've had better orgasm sauces.   Sun Devil Roll   - I don't do jalapenos usually but  this roll had the perfect amount to give it some kick without it being too overpowering. Yumyum sauce was fantastic. Probably my favorite roll of the night.   Caterpillar roll  - Came with shrimp tempura, would have liked for it to have more eel.   Philly Roll - Hard to mess up this classic.   I Love Sushi Roll - Spicy tuna with more tuna on top. Not bad, not amazing.   We also ordered one plate of teriyaki chicken for the kids as well as some sodas. Total damage with tax and before tip - $130. Overall, I was happy with my meal but wasn't blown away, especially for the price paid."}
{"text":"If this review was based on the food, it would most definitely be 5 stars. Service on the other hand, absolutely terrible. We saw our server one time and was finished eating 20 minutes before we got our bill. When I go out to eat I look for quality and good service. The quality would bring me to come back a million times over, the lack of service could keep me away forever."}
{"text":"Nice to see Eddie has also risen from the ashes that is the mess known as The Ka, to head his own counter, like Shawn at En Sushi...  Also like Shawn, he's doing riffs on his rolls from his early days at I Love Sushi, but he's added some new tricks up his sleeve and they're interesting and tasty.    If you like fun, funky, fusion rolls, then ST is easy to love."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is my favorite Sushi spot in Vegas. The restaurant is always clean & presentable and the staff are pleasant & attentive. This is a great place for weekday lunches with plenty of private booths for business.   The food is soooooo good! My favorite dish is the Grand Canyon roll. I'd never had anything like it before! A California roll smothered in onion sauce loaded with mushrooms, shrimp and scallops. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! The have a small but delicious Sake selection which the staff is well versed in and can recommend the best for your tastes. They are very accommodating to special diets as my boyfriend is diabetic and they can use cucumber instead of rice for your rolls.  Other than the delicious food and great service you will definitely remember their playlist. This is the only sushi place that plays r&b and top 40 music with videos or the game on the screens. It's pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"So, my first night in the Henderson/Vegas  area, I chose to eat here, it's Spicy Tuna.    Wasn't too crowded and I was able to sit at the bar and watch a football game.  I was promptly greeted and my drink order was taken. Then the sushi chef asked for my order.  Everything was fantastic, the textures, flavors and consistency.  The only thing that caught me by surprise is, there was no all you can eat option. Despite that fact, the $75 I spent was worth it all. I'll come back again"}
{"text":"Where great ambiance and great sushi collide. I've had some of my favorite rolls of all time here. Not the best when it comes to California Rolls, but some of the other options are pretty much fantastic. Very cool dining area as well. I make a point to visit this place at least once a week for a little sake and a lot of sushi. They also typically have sports on their several TVs, which is definitely a plus for me."}
{"text":"O.K. so I did like my food but my main problem here is that for a set lunch it's $8.95 but if you choose certain options it's $1.00 more....Alright so far that's fine with me, an option for $1.00 more is Barbecue Short Ribs-I'm thinking\" Hell Yeah\"- Then my food comes and it's literally 4 short ribs minus the meat- Yup, for $1.00 more- so actually for $9.95 I got 4 mini short rib bones and a few little fatty pieces.... Umm, Why even offer that as an option if you are gonna be so stingy-maybe if I were a dog and ate bones I would've felt satisfied but I'm not. Even if I were given 2 small pieces with the short rib intact (meat & bones) I would be more happy understanding that with a lunch special you will get a smaller portion but c'mon.... So I did think the food was tasty, the short rib fatty pieces/bones tasted good(too bad I had no meat to eat), tempura good, loved the salad dressing and the OG Roll good but not great (could've been more hot). OG Special- Spicy Salmon, Avocado, Yum Yum Sauce & Scallions Topped with Tabasco I would go back and be willing to try other items, items without bones that is!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone was so friendly and all jointly took care of us. The food came out quickly and all was very good. The honey roll was my favorite! Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is always clean and friendly service. My go to place when I am craving the JUSTIN SPECIAL!!! It's soooo good and fresh"}
{"text":"One of the best in town. Fish is always fresh, just wish the salmon wasn't farmed Atlantic salmon. Stick with wild caught fish like tuna, yellowtail, etc. love the Multiple O - a pile of varied sashimi on a bed of shredded radish, NO rice! Tiger, rainbow, crunch, princess Deanna, spider rolls are all great. Nigori sake hits the spot! Service is very good and super friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots! Their roll combinations are hysterically named and the tastiest I've had. I eat here about once a month and highly recommend. The staff is always professional and on point. The guys behind the sushi bar are so funny!"}
{"text":"I am a lover of sushi. But not just any sushi, I appreciate perfectly prepared, fresh fish sushi that makes me say, \"dang, that is delicious!\" Everything I ate at Spicy Tuna Sushi made me say exactly that!   We began by ordering the calamari tempura. The batter was light and delicious and the dish was served piping hot; just how I like it. Next, we ordered the Alaska Roll (soy wrapped as always). It had fresh crab, avocado, I believe some cream cheese topped with fresh salmon. It's definitely my new favorite. I enjoy simple, clean flavors.   We also decided on a second roll...I'm bummed I can't remember the full name, but it was Dr. Jason's something. I know that doesn't help much, but I did take a picture of it. : ) This one was another excellent choice! I don't know what was in it other than everything flavorful and delicious. It has a fun, large presentation too (lots of shredded tempura crispies on top). I highly recommend it!   I recently discovered how much I love mochi, so after dinner I inquired about their mochi options. They had green tea, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate and...red bean? Yup thats right, red bean. The server gave us the option to order two different flavors so we went for the traditional green tea and ventured out to try the red bean. Let me tell you the oddly sounding res bean was DELICIOUS!! It was sweet and tasted like cherries.   I am very much looking forward to visiting again to try new rolls and have some more red bean mochi!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant when I visited Nevada. On Wednesday afternoon, my aunt, sister and I went to the restaurant , and they were closed and not serving because of an inspection. The next day (Thursday) we came back to pick up some food. The lady at the front desk told us that she was thankful that we were giving them a second chance. Today (Friday) my aunt started feeling very sick. We were questioning what she had been eating, and the only food that she ate that was different from us was her Salmon Teriyaki Entree, her sickness progressed throughout the day and we concluded that she had food poisoning. We are really sad about it but we will probably never be back. :("}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi spot! They have the best service and freshest sushi! You have to ask for Gonzo we always sit with him at the sushi bar! I have a couple food restrictions and he always takes care of us! He'll make special rolls off the menu that are amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've only got food to go so I can't comment on the service. But their food is great! I'm not really a fan of the salad dressing. They've always been quick to get my order to me! I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow! I eat a lot of sushi outside but this was one level higher than all the rest! Amazing sushi and great staff (very helpful). We'll come back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi restaurant around! I frequent this restaurant as often as I can, which is probably once a month. Try the Kyle Special-- it is fabulous! Spicy Tuna is consistent and absolutely delicious every time. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I heard that sushi now has high radiation as a result of the Fukushima disaster. Spicy Tuna is the only sushi I have ever eaten that is well worth the radiation exposure! The Kelly D and ting special have raised the (sushi) bar. Oh- and always start off with the Keoki salad!!   The only reason spicy tuna got four stars is the service.  Every time we go we have the same server and she makes us feel like she is annoyed to have to help us... They should do something about that. If the food weren't so amazing we would have stopped going back a long time ago."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the first time and had a great time!  We ordered:  - Bottle of Star Rabbit sparkling sake - 1 Order of Salmon sashimi - 1 Order of Tuna sashimi - 1 D's Guy roll - 1 Tijuana roll  To start, they bring edamame and a small cucumber salad. To be honest, I could've done without this. The edamame was overcooked and the cucumber salad only had 4 thinly sliced cucumbers. It was a little sad.   The sashimi however, was super fresh! Salmon was incredible. Tuna was good, but I just preferred the salmon.  Both the D's Guy roll and Tijuana roll were amazing. Incredibly flavorful, perfect amount of sauce, nice different textures, and beautifully presented.   The best part of our dining experience was the host. He was hilarious. He kept us entertained, told jokes, and kept checking on us throughout our meal."}
{"text":"I've been several more times, service is young/inexperienced, but mostly attentive. The sushi is okay sometimes and other times, pretty bad. The place is sticky--floors and tables--we stopped going because it's marginally good food in a place that just feels dirty."}
{"text":"Holy flipping sushi. This is my all time favorite sushi place in the entire world. I didn't know what to expect, especially coming off the strip. A good friend of mine, Jen recommended this place so we went together. I LOVE that they bring out edamame, ginger, wasabi, and some kind of pickled something (cucumber?). We decided to order the Chihuahua Roll and D's guys. My mouth is watering just THINKING about them. Service was outstanding and the chefs were incredible. This place was so good that I made sure to come back on the last day of my trip. Definitely worth the trek off the strip if you're in town for vacation. And if you just live in vegas.. RUN, don't walk there!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's another sushi review, but at least it's a great place. My experience at Spicy Tuna is analogous to the gorgeous weather of that day - I love it. It's on Eastern Avenue, a street ubiquitous with sushi restaurants, but this is my personal favorite. The staff is always courteous and efficient. The décor is pleasant with dark wood furniture, paper lanterns, and dim lighting.  The tables by the walls are divided with partitions, so there's a sense of intimacy. There's a U-Shaped bar in the center. Their menu is large with 40+ rolls, salads, soups, ramen, udon, main entrees, sides, and desserts. It will take a while to read. My favorite rolls are the Justin Special and D Guy's special.   The Justin Special is a unique but refreshing roll--imitation crab meat enclosed by a gorgeous sliced salmon topped with fresh avocado, red onion, tomatoes, and soy sauce--is divine and healthy (except the sodium). On the glutinous side is the D Guy's special. It's gorgeous to the eye and orgasmic for my mind. My favorite \"cheat meal\", by far. I always dread that the owners might have an epiphany to edit their massive menu and eliminate these rolls, and I'm happy to report it has not happened yet. My ardor for this place can be traced back to my initial visit, and that enthusiasm is still alive today."}
{"text":"This review only covers my visit yesterday at lunchtime when I ordered nigiri a la carte, but I was very happy with my experience.  I was very surprised to see how large this restaurant is when I walked in - I expected it to be a narrow place but it is huge, and the sushi bar itself is the restaurant centerpiece and must seat like 30??  A few diners were trickling out when I arrived, but I came at 1:30 on a Wednesday so I wasn't expecting a wild crowd.  I sat at the bar in front of Chef Han, who was very personable.  We chatted about all sorts of things like travel and food while I leisurely sat and ate.  I got hot green tea which was exactly what I needed getting over my cold and with the weather changing.  I ordered salmon, mackerel, and whole scallop nigiri.  The seafood was very fresh and the cuts were generous.  The mackerel was perfectly cured.  There was less rice than I prefer but I know some people would like that.  Lastly, I ordered a yellowtail scallion handroll but ended up with a cut roll.  I decided to just take it because I think in the end I got a lot more of the yellowtail-scallion than I would have with a handroll anyway, and it was really quite fatty and delicious.  I was full from that, but Chef Han offered me orange with plum wine.  I never eat the oranges but my sister-in-law is a doctor and told me to drink OJ when I was sick, so this was the next best thing (plum wine makes it all better)!  I enjoyed another cup of hot tea while chatting with the chef before heading out to Trader Joe's next door.  This was a nice, quiet lunch experience with decent sushi, so I probably would pop in here again.  They are known for rolls but I think the nigiri is worth returning for again.  No AYCE here in case you are curious."}
{"text":"With a name like \"Spicy Tuna\" I did not have high hopes for this place. Almost all sushi places have something called spicy tuna on the menu and it is usually the little bits of tuna that are left over from cutting sashimi all chopped up and mixed with mayo and Sriracha and rolled into a maki. Not my favorite dish. As it turned out, this place had so much more than that to offer, including amazing sushi and beautiful presentation  I went here with my sister and her family while visiting a few weeks ago and we had a delicious dinner. My brother in law is a chronic over-orderer so that meant I got to try a lot of different dishes. Unfortunately don't remember all the names now but I did post pictures. I do remember that I really liked every single one of them. All the fish was fresh which is my primary gauge for a sushi restaurant. And the sauces and other accompaniments on each plate were only there to enhance the flavor of the fish. Everything was visually appealing as well. The service was friendly but not intrusive. Overall it was a great meal and I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Huge variety of sushi rolls. Staff was super friendly and helpful. They asked my hubby what he liked and recommended a roll with all his favorite stuff. The sushi was fresh and delicious and there was about 10 pieces per roll. Nom nom! Definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Right next to Trader Joes, Spicy Tuna is in an unassuming place, but it is a real gem.  The restaurant is comfortable, with nice big private booths and my absolute favorite Las Vegas roll: the \"Grand Canyon Roll,\" which I first experienced at Sushi Fever on the other side of town.    You see women meeting for lunch, families and couples all enjoying the food and atmosphere of Spicy Tuna.  If you are a low carb eater, they have great sashimi choices and the bento boxes are perfect for kids."}
{"text":"Greeted by all the staff the minute we walked in, nice enough start to the evening. We shared several offerings my favorite of which was D's Guy roll. The fish used was very fresh and tasty, also important when enjoying sushi. We shared lemon sake, amazing. The restaurant is a decent size and appeared well kept. My traveling companion who is an expert in Vegas sushi gave the place a thumbs up. I'm inclined to agree. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I loved all the rolls and salads I ordered here. I will def go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Sauces were nice but needed a little temperment. Definitely going back though. Service is on point. Could go a little slower perhaps."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes. Love this place. Coming from the Bay Area where I've had outstanding Sushi, I had a mild panic moving to Henderson because as a foodie, I know good food. I love Sushi was recommended and it was not worth the trip even though I literally live 1 block away. I found Spicy Tuna and decided to give it a try not expecting much and now this is the place I prefer to get Sushi from. Soooo Good with nice FIRM Tuna. I cannot stand mushy fish and this place makes me want to come back for more.  Now they can be busy so sometimes the wait can be a little long but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Vegas. Actually my favorite sushi place anywhere!!!! Everything and anything you order is fresh, large, unique and there is so much variety in terms of what you can order. Absolutely the best!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE."}
{"text":"My friend wanted some good udon and we were driving by Spicy Tuna so we stopped by to grab a quick dinner. We've been here before and had good experience with their roll selections. I decided to order Japanese style ramen since I haven't found a decent place in Vegas.  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER order the ramen here. It's just instant noodles. I was very very disappointed & offended since I was able to guess which instant noodles they were. I'm not going back because of their instant noodle on their menu."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is alright! The people I dined with loved it.  I didnt care for three things  1. the choice of music, the first time i dined there it was on point this time, someone in the back got ahold of the cd player & was playing some wack A** sh**  2. No half rolls, REALLY come on why not?   3. I think sushi should be bite size & at spicy tuna its definitely not, its not sexy on a date, well i guess some guys would be interested in seeing how much of that HUGE roll you can stuff in your mouth.  with all that said, i will be back. the sushi is good!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST sushi in Vegas! Been to many sushi spots and this one was my last stop. I've never been disappointed. Garlic edimame amazing! Justin roll my favorite low carb roll (salmon wrapped). Jay Special.....well it's one you MUST try and you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprise to find in Henderson. Not that they don't have great restaurants or sushi off the strip to be that good. In all truth it wasn't  spectacular. It's not like Seattle of SF, but it  good. Now that I'm going to be living here I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi in town.  The service can be a tad slow, but the wait is sooooo worth it.  You have to give this place a try.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid 4.  We were in the area doing Father's Day things and I searched \"nearby sushi bars\" on yelp. This place happened to come up 1st. We were craving some sushi and walked in to an almost empty restaurant. I was so glad...I ordered edamame (generous portion), 2 avacado cucumber rolls, a 2 item dinner special with bulgoki, and a side of rice. Oh yeah, my hubby had a coke.  We ended up with a 35.00 bill. Not bad! Affordable and quality food. The only thing I would change about my experience is asking them to not be so liberal with the dressing for the salad. Its very good but its strong. Also, the bulgoki was slightly like a stew which I've never seen before. Even still, it was hella good. Yay Spicy Tuna!"}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch and dinner and both are great but I've most recently went here for lunch.  They have the best lunch special ever! For $10 I received a salad (love the dressing!), rice, miso soup, egg rolls, spicy tuna roll, California roll, and rice plus a side of their spicy mayo sauce ($1 extra but well worth it!). You don't have to get the two rolls you have a choice of two different combinations I just chose those two because that is what I was in the mood for. You get so much food for you money and if you're not too hungry it's something you can split with someone else!   If you've only been there for dinner it's now time to try the lunch special."}
{"text":"This place was so good, and parked! The Garlic tuna, Caribbean albacore, NRES, Grand Canyon and Kelley D roll were AWESOME!!!!! Also had the house sake witch was really nice:) Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love all of the different kinds of sushi rolls they have here. It's always a good thing when too many things sound good on the menu that you have a hard time picking which ones. The sushi is always fresh."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down. The Ashley Roll is spicy melt in your mouth amazingness. One of the best sushi restaurants in Green Valley!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place. I had a AMEX gift card and I asked if I could use it here. The server said yes..so we sat ordered our drinks and then the server comes back and said we couldn't use it. So, we left. Last time I checked a gift card was the same as cash..annoyed because I really like this place. Not sure if I'll go back"}
{"text":"Amazing!   The #32 - Kelly D is amazing. Absolutely to die for. Also dont forget the #79 Monkey special with eel sauce and a deep fried banana!  Best Sushi in Vegas"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas!!!! Sit at the bar, the sushi chefs are a good time and they're great with recommendations!"}
{"text":"Today a group of us came by to have some well needed friend time and enjoy what else?  Some great sushi!  When you walk into this place, you are greeted by the hostess station on the left and a huge sushi bar area, front and center.  I could tell this place really focuses on the sushi bar style which is dramatic and eye catching!  On the sides, you literally have intimate cubbie sections for you and a date or a nice quiet family dinner.  There are TVs in the place that plays various Asian shows.  I really enjoyed the decor.  Dramatic stained glass lighting, Japanese lanterns, cloth paneling with Asian inspired pictures and Kanji galore!  This place definitely gets a 5 star in my book for the decor :)  For my meal, I got a great deal!  Their lunch special is only $8.95 and offers A LOT of food!  On my plate, I started with a bowl of their miso soup.  Filled with seaweed and tofu, this miso was delish!  As an added bonus, the table got a couple of cups filled with lightly salty edamame.  Makes me feel healthy!  On the lunch special, you can choose 2 items from a list of about 20!!  I chose the chicken katsu and grilled makarel.  The chicken katsu was AH-MAZE-ING!!  White meat lightly breaded and deep fried.  Their katsu sauce was more on the savory-tangy side and sooo my type!  The grilled makarel was nicely charred and super flaky.  YUM!!  Garnished with a couple of slices of lemon.  Both were served over a bed of shredded cabbage.  On top of all that, this special is served with white rice, seasoned with furikake, or seaweed rice seasoning with sesame seeds.  People, we're not done yet!  This dish also comes with a salad thats topped with a mustard based dressing.  Usually when I go to sushi joints, I expect a salad with a vinegar-ginger based dressing as it's everywhere, so I REALLY appreciated a change.  Lastly, this special came with a couple of fried gyoza stuffed with pork and half of an egg roll.  The entire special was finished with a wedge of orange.  WOW, what a steal!  I was in lunch special heaven.  Everything was so good and just the right amount.   Our table also got other things like the garlic edamame.  I loved the garlic flavor and the hint of spiciness.  Really knocked it out of the park in the game of edamame!  Man, oh man!  For the value of a lunch meal, how can you go wrong?!  This place rocked!  Great company, great food, great atmosphere.  Definitely coming back, I will!  Oh, and you should too!!!"}
{"text":"It is the first time to write a review for sushi place. I have been going to this place over 3 yrs and the food flavor  is alway same!! It is incredible  and unbelievable! I tried lots of sushi places already.   But Whenever i go this place,  there is  no mistake, no problem!!  Also price is really reasonable not expensive! Overall this place is amazing and I dare to recommend this place who want to have real fresh sushi and sashimi and rolls! Everything  is awesome! !"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Excellent service. Worth every penny!  With so many choices to choose from, this place is my favorite.  They buy the largest tunas I've seen."}
{"text":"On christmas eve, we decided to get sushi nearby, and we are so happy we decided on this place.   The staff is very kind and patient. They even gave us recommendations (special roll 15 kept them in business apparently).  I ordered the justin special (im annoying, i know), but it is such a fresh dish. The sushi is wrapped around the roll, put in with a nice liquid spicy/tangy sauce that i couldn't get enough of. I also got a bite of special 15, and it was bomb. The fried ball on top of the sushi roll was perfect.   Parking is easy and great as well.   Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna Sushi never disappoints. There are endless rolls to choose from. The staff is friendly and make the dining experience just that more enjoyable. Most importantly it's where my girlfriend and I went on our first date! Spicy Tuna is the Cupid of sushi."}
{"text":"Rolls galore! They are super serious at this restaurant about their sushi rolls!  Really read through all of them because many of the rolls they have here they don't have at any other Japanese restaurant I have been to.   They are very tasty.  I'll come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Service was great and the rolls we had were delicious. The Dani hand roll was my fave! When I searched for this place I typed in \"all you can eat sushi\" in Yelp and this place came up. After we had sat down and ordered drinks they told us they did not have AYCE. Soo, it was a pretty pricey dinner."}
{"text":"We were worried coming here because other reviews said it was expensive. I'm glad we tried it anyways as the portions were huge and the prices were comparable to other sushi houses. Service was VERY fast. Make sure to try anything with soft shell crab. D's guy special w/ garlic ponzu was amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi bar!!! I always order a ton of sashimi and it's always the freshest around! Love the salmon yellowtail and the bluefin when they have it in!! Such an awesome staff too!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found Yelp, I can't believe how much I love Spicy Tuna and now I get to tell everyone about it.  I was a long time customer of I Love Sushi down the street and my friend ---- World Famous Race Car Driver with the initials DG ---- told me that I needed to skip out on ILS once and try this Spicy Tuna place.  I swear to God on my kids lives!!! If I knew I were going to die tonight this is where I'd go to dinner. While I was there I'd go ahead and try to eat myself to death before whatever else was gonna get me got me."}
{"text":"So what's with the fact that there are 50 place in town that all have the same sushi roll names. \"Who's your daddy\" \"tastes like my ex\", etc, etc. I mean I'm all for fun names, but why do they all have the same weird pseudo-sexual names? Is there some huge corporate conglomerate in japan opening up tons of \"mom and pop\" sushi shops here in Vegas ? I don't get it.. anyways, with that off my chest....  We came for the spyonvegas open bar night. While the free sapporo was nice, the service was awful. I 100% don't blame them, however, because this place was SLAMMED. 1 thing I ordered never showed up, and another roll was pretty messed up. That beging said...  The sushi was good. They use the same krab junk that every \"sexual sushi\" place does in Vegas. The rolls were creative and had stupid names . I recommend the Joe's special... a sort of spicy tuna roll with avocado covered in garlic ponzu sauce. I like some of the items on I love sushi's menu better that I didn't find here (Screaming Orgasm anyone?), but overall they were really similar in pricing, roll variety, fish quality, etc! It would be hard to choose... but for now I prefer I love sushi."}
{"text":"Great place! Clean, fast and very spacious, ambience is elegant, well designed and quiet atmosphere,good for lunch or dinner, staff is very friendly and the food is delicious!  Well priced for the quality and the amount of food they served, I will recommend this place, definitely   I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Food is always delish!!!!  I try new things all the time. Always tastes fresh and keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"Okay so after my so-so experience, my friend dragged me back to this place. I decided to order a roll #43. Mike's Roll and #49 Princess Diana.... Oh-my-goodness! I know the owners haven't changed and their menu hasn't changed either, but maybe this whole time I was ordering the wrong thing! Like salmon sashimi or chicken teri bowls... The rolls they have are very similar to I Love Sushi because the owner actually worked there and then opened this location. Sharing some rolls, drinking Sapporo, and snacking on their garlic edemame was absolutely delicious!!! Im so glad I went back to this place! Third time is a charm!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi. Shame about the atmosphere. It's a large space and the interior is definitely lacking but have always been impressed with the food"}
{"text":"The best sushi by far!!! Very fresh and creative!"}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna! This is a sushi bar in a strip mall nestled between a couple of large anchor stores. My server was great, I never had to wait for anything.  The decor is extremely nice; open, airy and very clean. There are tables by the wall that are each separated by a partition, a nice touch. the sushi bar itself is huge, it takes up almost the entire center of the restaurant.   The fish was delicious. Very fresh and nicely presented. I also felt the price paid for my food was extremely reasonable, a very good deal for some excellent sushi.  I look forward to my next visit; the food was so good I can't wait to sample some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Henderson. The staff was very friendly and helped entertain my baby by making faces and dancing for him while I ate my sushi. I love the cucumber salad, the multiple o, d's guy roll, and Justin's special. If I could afford it I would eat here twice a week!"}
{"text":"Quite an extensive list of sushi roll choices. Of course, we were looking for uni w/ quail egg, hamachi sashimi, and hamachi collars -- they did not disappoint. The fish was fresh, quickly, and with a visit from one of the sushi chefs.  The decor was casual but classy. We ate here with our children which was fine because it was still early in the evening. The girls enjoyed udon with tempura and spicy ramen (which they adjusted to suit her taste).   There are quite a few tables, individual semi-private \"rooms\" (tables separated by walls), and a sushi bar and about three televisions playing basketball.  One of the rolls we did indulge in was the Grand Canyon (since we had just come from there). It was sautéed scallops, shrimp, mushrooms, and onions over California roll. Delish! (My son did think it would have been cool to create an \"Arizona Roll\" and then top it with the sautéed mixture!)  We don't live here, however, we'd recommend this place to others. The service was friendly, attentive, and fast. We paid just about $100 for 3 rolls, 2 orders of uni, 2 orders of hamachi sashimi, hamachi collars, udon, and ramen. Pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"I had a quick dinner here this evening. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted so I told the chef what I like, (I wish I had asked his name) and he created me a roll of yummy goodness. The yellowtail was super fresh and the cuts were perfect and larger in portion. This is a drive for me from my home but I may have to make it for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best sushi place you can find in Henderson. The downside, it is a bit pricey and you want to try a lot of the special rolls when you go there with a family of four or five. They have great hand rolls and sashimi as well. Service can be a little iffy, depending on who looks after you."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, creative rolls/dishes, friendly and helpful staff. Chef had good recommendations based upon our preferences. Will return."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant we have been to multiple times and always are happy with our meal.  The quality of fish (Salmon and Yellowtail) are amazing and it melts in your mouth...mmmmmmm!  One of our favorite rolls is the Ting's Roll, which is now on their menu.  It was one of those, secret menu items.  If you order the Ting's Roll, make sure that you come with an appetite!!"}
{"text":"There are sushi is wonderful. They have a great, fresh selection!!! Even there seaweed salad is bomb. Wish the staff was a bit friendlier but love love love it"}
{"text":"This is a good sushi option in Henderson, not my first choice for non AYCE, it's probably third or fourth, but a good place to go if you're looking for rolls. Eddie, the owner, is also another reason to come. He's engaging, friendly, and attentive. I'll usually come in for lunch and sit at the bar directly in front of Eddie.  While you're looking over the very roll-centric menu, you can snack on the complimentary edamame and cucumber salad. There's also a full menu of hot dishes, but there is no separate menu or listing of nigiri. If you like ponzu like me, there is a good number of rolls designated on the menu that sit in a pool of the tangy G-ponzu sauce. Overall, many of the rolls are kind of redundant with the same ingredients, especially fish, on the inside with variations of sauces on the outside.  There's also a section of the menu dedicated to sashimi dishes. The halibut jalapeño is my favorite and definitely recommended if you like halibut and spice. When you're finished, you'll get a small serving of freshly sliced oranges to cleanse the palate.   There's plenty of seating in the restaurant and you usually won't have to wait for a table. The two servers on the floor are experienced and will do well to take care of your needs. A couple of rolls will set you back an AYCE price, so those looking to fill up or if you're more of a nigiri fan, this place might not be for you. If you're a roll fan, Spicy Tuna has plenty of selection and variety to make you happy."}
{"text":"Big fan!  Service is always top notch and food is some of the best in the area. I would highly recommend the Jay Special or one of their many hand roll specials. The names of the rolls are a bit tired but besides that nothing else negative!  Prices are very good as well. They don't gouge customers on the beer and sake like other local sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"This was one of the best, most unique sushi experiences I've had so far, but sadly I don't get to eat sushi often because my husband hates it.  I was so happy to eat such good sushi that had no rice, as I can't really eat a lot of carbs.  I ordered the Justin Special, which has fresh salmon wrapped around crab, with lots of avocado, cucumber, tomato, and some other veggie type stuff with ponzu sauce drizzled all over.  No rice!  It was frickin awesome and huge for 13 bucks.  I was full from this but I had also ordered the Danny hand roll which was chock full of yummy seafood and avocado, once again no rice.  Wonderful but hard to eat because I was so full.  Husband had a dinner special bento box which was really unique, and the chicken teriyaki was wonderful.  They had this ball of deep fried rice which was flavorful and delicious, along with goyza, salad, regular white rice and some other goodies.  Amazingly enough he loved it.  This was not a cheap dinner as we paid like 55 bucks with tip, although it was an insane amount of food.  We can't afford to eat here regularly, but we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here about 3 times already.  The workers are nice, funny, and informative.   Rolls are delicious. Ambiance is inviting. Great location in Seven Hills.  Try the birthday roll ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Clark County.  I love double D,  Justin,  and screaming O.  So fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. The fish was fresh. The rolls were delicious. The only down side was that we felt a little like a number coming through the front door. We were seated quickly by a woman that barely looked at us. Most of the staff was friendly and took their time to answer questions. No AYCE. Price for two girls - about $58. 1 water. 1 tea."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is a great neighborhood sushi bar.  Gonzo is a really good and attentive chef.  The sushi is solid, but some of the rolls are great!  The ambiance could be better, specifically the lighting.  It is too bright in there.  With lower lighting levels, the place could be much cooler.  The owner -- Eddie -- is a pretty funny guy."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely amazing (Japanese-styled)! Food was even better. They had a few different choices of sake, which was awesome (cold and hot). I'm not a fan of sushi, or any fish for that matter, but I've been to sushi places with friends. I've got to say that the sushi rolls at Spicy Tuna were pieces of art, very appealing to sushi lovers and pretty big in size. I would highly recommend this place for anyone. Plenty of options for sushi and non-sushi eaters"}
{"text":"My second favorite place after I Love Sushi.  They are very different, so it's hard to compare.  Gonzo makes my rolls perfectly every time.  Their salad dressing is really really good - much better than I've had at other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Each roll is SUPER creative and you really can't go wrong!  I am a huge fan of their hand rolls and they were more then accommodating when I visited last time and asked them to go light on the mayo! The sushi chef showed me as he was making it to be sure it was ok! THANK YOU!  I always have the spicy ramen soup and its SO GOOD! I also love their garlic edamame and the ashley roll (obsessed with LEMON slices on my rolls; nice fresh burst of lemony goodness!  I wish they had a working web-site because I love to have the option to choose my roll before I go (I am super weird sometimes and like to PRE-SELECT everything so I don't drive my friends nuts when I can't decide).    I had the Birthday Roll on my birthday, nice surprise! I definitely LOL'D at that one!"}
{"text":"The good: staff was uniformly friendly and welcoming. Fish was of a solid quality. It is convenient to a Trader Joe's.  The bad: limited menu focusing on rolls, with an orientation toward spicy rolls, mixed, and cooked items. I can get equal or better sushi elsewhere for the same or better prices, So, ultimately the question is, why would I pay more for a more limited menu of items that I mostly do not particularly care for?"}
{"text":"The sushi at Spicy Tuna was so fresh that it made me rethink every other single sushi place I had ever eaten at. This is definitely going to be my main go-to-place when I get weekly cravings for sushi.  Everything I have tried here was great! My favorites are the Kiss of Fire, the Anthem Roll with added garlic ponzu sauce, the 944 Special (justin something or other) and their Screaming Orgasm. Many more things to try though and i am sure I will like it all.   Very friendly staff! Definitely sit at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"The gyoza and ramen are not good at all. I think I bought the same gyoza frozen at the grocery store before. Also the ramen is flavorless. Neither item is worth more than $1.....these items are absolutely overpriced"}
{"text":"I'm in love!!!  Too bad I'm moving out of state in 2 weeks since finding this place.   Must orders: Tijuana roll, D's guys, hooters special, NRES, spicy edamame, lunch special plate, cucumber salad (amazing and enough for 2 people), and the Danny hand roll. The best is the spicy ponzu sauce, it's nothing you've tried before.  Every place I've tried since I'm comparing to Spicy Tuna. I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can get my sushi on. Be warned there are about 50+ rolls to choose from. Give yourself to time to read through all the choices. The rolls are huge so come hungry!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday afternoon.. The place was bustling and the staff seated me immediately. I ordered the edamame while waiting for my lunch partner, which came in a huuuuge bowl. They also offer a spicy edamame, which I didn't try (spicy food is not my friend). The menu is HUGE and can be overwhelming. We ordered four or five rolls. Service was fast and prices were pretty good! $10-$15 per roll. I like the effort and creativity they put into it - you'll see combos here you'd never even think of! I'd definitely come back, but just plan to spend some time looking over the menu. Great spot for a lunch date or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Always so pleased with the service and food! Had an incredible craving for yellowtail collar and they did not disappoint... And then some! A definite go to..."}
{"text":"Exceptional service.  Got the Mexican roll and it was delish.  Surprisingly fresh as 98% of most sushi places in Las Vegas seem to use frozen fish and fake crab.  I can't believe I haven't been here before. So now I have 2 sushi places!!! Everyone was super nicem. I just hope my 2nd and 3rd visits are as good so I can also compliment them on consistency."}
{"text":"How did we JUST stumble upon this place?!  Funny story. We planned on coming here the day beforehand when we found it on Yelp and were so excited. When we pulled up, the sign said \"closed\" and we were like... uhhhhhh. I was like, they have to be open! We checked Yelp and it said they were open. We walked up and \"nose go-ed\" it and I lost. So here I am going to open the door hoping they're not closed. And lo and behold they were open... with lots of people in there. Okay, maybe not so funny. Just thank you Yelp for posting the correct hours. I think they forgot to turn their closed sign off. Haha.  Anywayyyyy.  The ambiance of the place is really nice.  It's super clean. Big open space. They can fit large parties.   Upon being seated, they brought us complimentary cucumber salad and edamame (yums!). Our drink orders were taken quickly and we had needed some time to check out the wonderfully long list of different sushi rolls. I am in love with anything with lemon so we got the Ashley Roll. We also got the Spicy Shrimp Roll. Prices weren't too bad for what we got and it was actually quite filling for the two of us!  I would definitely recommend this place for their rolls and am excited to come back to try something new!  Tip: ask for ponzu sauce and dip your sushi in it... extra delicious flavor for your mouth."}
{"text":"After having a couple different people recommend this place I thought we would give it a try. We are big \"I love sushi\" fans so when I was told the owner of Spicy Tuna used to be the head chef there I was excited.   We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were seated quickly. We were given edamame and a tiny cucumber salad (about two bites). the cucumber salad was delicious, just wish it was a little bigger. The edamame were cold and not very good.  We ordered a few different pieces of sushi, a couple rolls and one specialty roll. The food came out very quickly and we were constantly checked on by several different people.  Unfortunately I was not impressed with the sushi. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either, just middle of the road. It was presented nicely but nothing struck me as really good.   I gave Spicy Tuna 3 stars mostly for the great service. If it wasn't for that, it would have been 2 stars. I will stick with I love sushi in the future."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot in vegas! I don't come THAT often, but every time I do, they remember who I am which is very welcoming. I usually get joes special roll with jalapeño, it's amazing, as well as every other roll I've tried! Yum"}
{"text":"Not my favorite, but the food was solid. Many of the rolls were larger than expected, however the rock n roll (my favorite) was a bit small. The prices were fair but no all you can eat. I would eat here again, but it would not be my pick."}
{"text":"Great I love this place for a few rolls with my wife.  Or a roll and beer with a friend.  High quality , good rolls and nice environment.  I like the place for great sushi and a drink but when I really hungry for sushi I head to Inaka.  More bang for my buck but not the bling or style ."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 star place.  Good sushi, great atmosphere.  The entire staff is fun and polite.  I especially like the Lisa Hand Roll and the Grand Canyon is an interesting selection."}
{"text":"It has taken me more than one year living in LV to find a sushi place that I truly love, but this one is it.  First and foremost, the food is amazing.  Great menu variety and really top quality.  The ambiance and the staff are also great.  It's a nice place to go either with a group or just alone when I get out of work late and don't want to cook.  I've never asked them to customize anything because there are lots of items on the menu that I still want to try.  But they are always friendly and accommodating, and I think that type of thing would be fine.  Most of the items have cucumber, which I don't like, so I think on an upcoming visit I'll run out of other things and will need to do that."}
