{"text":"Food was awesome we stopped by to check out the stand for lunch .
He had an A rating with local health department.
Food was as fresh as you could get . 
I've had plenty of dogs from around the world and this one sits at the top we got the award winning chili dogs and that they were .
So to the person who left a rude review who never even ate here and has what it looks like a career in reviews 87 to be exact  if you check his profile Pen√©lope A. Doesn't know a damn thing about food at all . But over all we will definitely be back . :)"}

{"text":"Mr Martz isnt very smart by publicly admitting that he cuts corners on health code standards. How do I know this? I live in another state and was googling about the hot dog business. Thats when I found a comment written from Mr Martzs own facebook account, detailing his business as well as publicly admitting that he violates health codes to cut corners, save money.  just thought Id send out a fair warning. you can find the comment as of now by googling \"learn hotdogs martz milner\" and then clicking on \"average income for hot dog vendor\".  then id just avoid this guy, you might get sick!"}
