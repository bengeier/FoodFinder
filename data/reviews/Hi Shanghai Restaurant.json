{"text":"Had high expectations for this place. Sadly, it was just OK.  Parking: It was easy finding parking (11am on a Sunday). Apart from the mall parking, you could park near the GO station. Crowds: Got seated with no wait time. We settled for one of the middle tables because all the booths were taken. - Tables were mostly Chinese families and the ambiance was certainly HK cafe-esque. Some tables were occupied by senior citizens reading Chinese dailies.  Decor: The decor is nice enough. High ceilings, white linen tablecloth, half-moon booths. However, how fancy can you really get within a (dying) retail mall?  Cost: Went for dimsum and got there before 1130am so S, M, L items were all $2.30. Made the mistake of ordering two items that were XL- those came in at 4.50. (Note the xiao long bao is XL).  Service: Was seated prompted. Food took a little bit to come out. Wait staff all assumed we spoke Cantonese. I'd say service was typical for a Chinese restaurant: efficient, albeit a bit brusque. Food:  Ordered 8 items:  Good - Shrimp Rice Roll (chao fun)  - Siomai- Not the best we've had, but good enough - Tofu with shrimp - Tofu was steamed - really soft and jelly-like. Taste was mild but we liked the soft tofu texture and the broth  Bad  - Pork and duck egg congee  - xiao long bao - expected more. Yes, it seemed to have been executed well (hot soup intact) but taste left us wanting more. Did not think this was worth 4.50 for 4 small pieces  So-so - durian pastry - it was ok. Could have done with more durian  - har gaw (shrimp siomai) - I thought it was tasty - wife thought otherwise - Chives pancake - I order this every time I see it on any menu. So-so execution  What to try next time:  - Fried fish - Pan fried buns - Regular (non-dimsum) menu"}
{"text":"I'm from Shanghai and I've been on a quest around Toronto hoping to find authentic food from my hometown.  Today I ordered  Shanghai steamed mini buns Shanghai pan fried pork buns Steamed sao-mai Stir fried shredded eel Meatball with Shanghai bai-cai Shanghai fried noodles.  Now on the goodness meter Mini buns and shredded eel were good Everything else was meh  On the authenticity meter Only the shredded eel passed Everything else flopped However their steamed mini buns is the best i've had so far in Toronto. (better than the other highly rated place at first markham place)  This place gets a 3 for gettin the eel right and having good mini buns"}
{"text":"Parking outside can be annoying due to all the people going to pmall or go train taking up the spots but lunch here is nice. Restaurant is usually not too full so no need to wait in long lines and food here is decent. Atmosphere here is also very nice. I'd say this is an alright place to go as a group for lunch if you couldn't think of anywhere to go last minute as well since you're most likely not going to have too much difficulty getting a table for large number of people."}
{"text":"Traditional Shanghai cuisine in a very modern and clean atmosphere. Waiters need a bit of an attitude adjustment but other than that not much else in complaints. If you want their stuffed bird or peking duck you'll need to pre-order."}
{"text":"went with my bf today to try out this rather hidden restaurant. We ordered the orange chicken, tofu kong xin vegetable, sweet and sour fish (?), and red bean paste buns. Everything tasted decent except for the fish which tasted a bit fishy even with the breading and the sauce on top of it. That was probably not fresh. Aside from that, I liked the environment and ambience of the restaurant. It seemed classy and elegant. I'd probably come back here to try more of their dishes (just won't order fish dishes next time.)"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the decor is really nice! But the food is just ok. The service is just slow. Looks like they are under staff. (only 2 : lunch time)  Personally I'd rather choose \"Skyland De Shanghai\" for Shanghai Cuisine."}
{"text":"This dinner here had the potential to become the most awkward dinner of my life, and a possible disaster...if it were not for my limitless social politics skills.   Isabelle's family invited my family to dinner here, which is the only upscale restaurant within 'Splendid China Plaza'.  I had only been here to buy tennis clothes, and bring Isabelle to get her nails done once before.  This plaza is certainly anything but splendid.  First it was the circling game...where my family circled the plaza until Isabelle's family would arrive since they were the host..but then I saw Isabelle and her mother circle the plaza...so we had to circle some more while avoiding them.  Then when we could circle no more..we found out that her Father was already inside the restaurant waiting for us.  Nobody won the arrive later game. We all sat down and the parents left the ordering to us 'children', Isabelle is a learned Chinese Woman...I left China when I was nine.  I'm cultured...but not ordering off of a new menu cultured.  If you know Chinese food, you know that they all have names bestowed from the heavens..with translations from hell.  Working out what to eat was like trying to figured out which colour wire to cut in a bomb scene.    The d√©cor was dull and there were no signature giant fish tanks, but at least our table wasn't wobbly.  White cloth table linens, very simple.  We were the only significant party here, so our conversations resonated throughout the floor.  The waiters were professional and entertaining, good service overall.  The food arrived, and like cattle, I was fed by the opposite family.  Food came onto my plate as if I was five years old and wasn't capable of using chopsticks.  I guess we'll always been children until we have children ourselves.  There was a chair between me and Isabelle, and it became slightly awkward until that chair was filled by the totally unexpected arrival of Isabelle's new boyfriend from Shanghai.  Like..fresh off the boat...and now it was extremely awkward.     I guess he was good looking, charming, but above all noticeably..taller.  Let's just say it was a surprise to my family, and now the entire outcome of the evening rested upon my shoulders.  My Chinese culture went into hyper-drive and I forced out intelligent conversation like a grade 7 vinegar and baking soda experiment.  It became pleasant eventually, and we got along rather splendidly.  At one point a dish arrived, and Mr. Shanghai said: we call these 'cold dishes' in Shanghai.   \"Oh,\"  I replied, \"Because in Qingdao we call these....'cold dishes as well.'  He got my point and retracted.  Later I oneuped him with an ancient Chinese parable that had the whole table shoot back into their chairs.  Nothing like unexpected knowledge. =]  I always end up playing host no matter what function I attend, people don't seem to understand that having drinks and food is not nearly enough to entertain guests.  But I had the situation under control this time, and the dinner went successfully.  Three hours, and not for a moment were we short on food.  The place prepared dishes quickly and well, I might come back here for lunch.   I think we ordered a total of 23 dishes.  At the end of the night we were on the Shanghai High, a lovely time was had by all.  The restaurant could benefit from a better location in my opinion. The family friendship lives.  Of course all of this is mumbo-jumbo if you're not familiar with Chinese dinner etiquette.  So in case of this..Hi Shanghai is a fairly well managed restaurant with decent food.    But for me...I was just glad it was over and I would be saying Bye Shanghai instead."}
{"text":"My family has been visiting this place for a few years because we are Shanghainess and we love Shanghai food. The quality and the quantify of food in this place sort of gets worse and worse, though it is still a fairly good Shanghai food restaurant when comparing to other restaurants. The last time that we were there, we called a day beforehand to pre-order a pecking duck but when we were seated we waited more than 30 mins for the duck to arrive."}
{"text":"Today, my family and I had lunch at Hi Shanghai Restaurant in Scarborough (right at the border of Scarborough and Markham.) This is my second visit to this establishment, needless to say, since I returned, it's really good. I'm pleased to announce that this place is vegetarian/ vegan friendly, which is the MOST important thing to me when dining out.  I love the interior design of the restaurant, it's bright with dark accents, and it doesn't have the cheesy look of most Chinese restaurant establishments. The china and eating utensils were clean and the tables were covered in real table cloths, opposed to plastics or no table cloths in some Chinese eating establishments. While the restaurant is a very welcoming and accommodating to all its guests from all walks of life, it has a quiet and peaceful ambiance, which allows one to enjoy the lovely food creations  and the company of your dining party.  The dim sum and entree menus are very vegan/ vegetarian friendly and also fairly priced for the quality of food you receive. The dim sums are carefully and well prepared, for example,  the dough fritter rice roll is crispy, hot and well wrapped; the veggie steamed dumplings consist of julienned vegetables held together by a medium thick dumpling shell that is skillfully crafted, and the onion pancake is thin and perfectly crispy.  We also enjoyed a delicious and fresh dish of ho fun noodle with peanut sauce and julienned vegetables.   I would definitely come back to try other entrees at dinner time. I really like pretty restaurants with delicious and beautiful dishes. Moreover, I really like places where I could take my time to enjoy my food and my  family/ friends/ dates accompanying me in a nice, soft, and elegant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  No one goes to this mall.  I attended a set dinner here that required ordering at least two days before.  There was way too much food.  Every course was perfect.  The ingredients were top notch.  The techniques were perfect.  The presentation was carefully done and the service was the best that I have seen at a Chinese restaurant in Toronto.  No clanging plates and spoons.  Careful placement of things on the turntable."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre... just OK, nothing to write home about.  The eel over noodle soup is probably the best; the stir fried shrimp is pretty good too.  The vegetable dish was just mediocre, and because of this dish, and the associated miscommunication, and worse, that prompted the 2 stars.  We at first want to order the stir fried pea sprouts (the waiter also mentioned that they have bok choy sprouts).  After a little while, the waiter said they have run out of both pea sprouts and bok choy sprouts.  They can only offer several vegetable dishes from the menu.  We picked the Shanghainese bok choy with soy beans and gluten balls.  After all the dishes are on our table, and we finished half of the vegetable dish, a dish of pea sprouts suddenly appeared.  We told them that we want the pea sprouts and want them to take back the Shanghainese bok choy dish, as it was their mistake.  They basically said no, saying that they can give this pea sprout dish to some other customer when they order it.  But she said, next time when we go again, they will treat us... yeah right!  I told her that there will be no next time.  So is the 2 stars too generous?"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant for chinese food! Its very clean, stylish, a lot of different variation of yamee dishes. Very very nice! Steemed short ribs in black peper are the best. All of dim sams is delitios! Shrimp hargou is the best."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch time experience. So it might be limited and bias... in my own special way.. :)  I walked by and saw $5.99 for lunch that includes soup or soy milk drink.. You know I cannot resist the deal.  I went there on a Friday afternoon around 12 pm. The place is practically empty... The restaurant is nicely decorated with high ceilings and comfortable seatings. They also have some little table that is perfect for 1 to 2 people at the front on the right of the entrance.  I ordered the lunch special of course! There are over 20 different ones you can choose from. Some selections are Shanghai and some are cantonese style... spicy or non spicy...meat lover or vegetarian choices.   I decided on the diced chicken with peanuts in spicy sauce aks Kung Pao Chicken  (a pepper next to the item denoted that it is a hot dish) with soup of the day sweet and sour soup.  Everything arrived at my table on the same time. I have to say I was disappointed.  None of the food is hot.. I am not talking about spicy hot.. at least they should be hot  and steaming when they are served to the customers.   None of the food is hot.. I am talking about spicy hot. If it is an authentic shangahi restaurant, both my order should be spicy spicy hot!! (Asian Legends Kung Pao chicken has tons of dried pepper inside, and the sweet and sour soup has red chilli oil flowing on top!)   When I see there are Cantonese dim sums offering on their menu... I should not be surprise that Hi Shanghai lose their authentic shangainese style....  The food I ordered does not tastes like they were freshly made. More like they have everything pre made and just dish them out and served. At least put them in a micowave and heat it up!!   The staffs are quite indifference and cold, no smiles, no thank you.. I did not feel too welcome. And I found it really rude when the waitress just stood there and watched me and see how much I am tipping her...  They do have good prices for Cantonese/Shanghai dim sums all sizes order for $2.30 before 11:30 AM.  There are so many choices in Scarborough/Markham area for Chinese food. I don't think I will be going back there again for lunch.   1 star for food; 2 stars for environment   BTW, now you know why this place is nice and quiet during lunch time!"}
{"text":"We walk in around 7pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant is almost empty. That's never a good sign. Still, we stuck around and ate there. The service was quite poor.. no menus when we sat down and the waiters didn't seem to want to be there. The only decent dish there as the spicy beef noodle soup. The yang zhou fried rice was awful. It tasted like they just mixed white rice with a can of mixed vegetables, some ham, and forgot to add the salt. The rest of the dishes were kind of bad but not bad enough to talk about here."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this place on the arrival of the city (yes we are tourist).  saturday noon (11am?), the place was half empty.  saw their dim-sum + shanghainese dumpling menu, went in.  ordered wayyyyyy too many things for all 4 of us.  didn't realize the sweet soy milk came in a serving soup bowl for $1.50 or so each!  in retrospect, waitress should have warned us about the amount we were ordering, with so many other things on tab as well.  oh well.  food was ok--liked everything except the shanghai noodle.  how ironic.    bill came out to be $10 each ($40 total) maybe?  not bad.  and we had about 6 fried dough and some other random things to bring home.  service...  yeah, slow at best, and wait staff is not the brightest bulb in the house.  waited so long to get the bill, then had to wait another while to get the to-go boxes.  *sigh*   at least the decor is simple, elegant, and pleasing. :)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the quietest and most nicely decored chinese restaurant in the gta. The atmosphere is simply the best. The food is average, nothing special. But the atmosphere makes up for it."}
