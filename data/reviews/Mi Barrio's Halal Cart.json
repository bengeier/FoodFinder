{"text":"This place is really good.  Open late, awesome food.  We got the lamb and chicken dish, and the falafel.  Will go back again if I am in town!"}
{"text":"There was a nice guy that used to run this cart. One day he was gone.  The rice isn't the same and overall spirit is gone. . The new older guy seems so rude, he acts as if you aren't standing there. Won't be back,  but ill go to the one in University"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Very quick and very easy. And you get plenty of food for the price. I've been to NY plenty of times and they've captured the concept to perfection."}
{"text":"It's cash only but worth every cent, been eating here at least once a week for the past two years.  Friendly staff, sometimes there is a bit of a wait time but so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Most awesome food at the most awesome price at almost any time of the day. The lamb over rice is one of my favorites.

The spicy sauce is the cherry on the cake :)"}
{"text":"OOOHHHWWWEEEEE! I'm in heaven!  $6 makes me holler for some divine lunch!  Coming from a larger well-established city, I REALLY miss food like this.  Everything was flavored beautifully, they made it so quickly and it was super convenient for the few days of the work week I forget to pack a lunch (ok, maybe it's a intentional forgetting).  
I like the lamb and chicken combo and I ask for it hot.  And boy oh boy is it hot!  Thank goodness for the creamy saucy stuff (similar to a tzatziki?) to even it out - maybe I'll ask for the hot stuff on the side next time.  No, no I won't - it wonderful just the way it is.  There's vegetarian options and salads available too.  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Speaking from an Arabic view, it is the best you will find. Probably the best falafel I've had outside of the Middle East."}
{"text":"Best lunch ever. Just get the combo - spicy or extra spicy... I got extra spicy today and oh my, that heat. $7 with a drink to handle the fire.

Get there early at lunch or there will be somewhat of a wait. Regardless, it's worth it. It's really just rice, meat and badass spices/sauces (there is a little salad on the side). You'll probably dream about making your own sauces, so you can use it on everything.

I've been told they make a good philly, too.

Cash only"}
{"text":"This has become a staple for lunch options Uptown. 
The food is fantastic and prices are great. 
There's almost always a huge line though!"}
{"text":"Ordered food and paid for it but never got it. These guys are assholes. Wish I could give less than a 1 star"}
{"text":"Eat at your own risk.  I was excited to see this cart in the university area.  Passed it many times and always wanted to stop there.  Finally did.  Based on the reviews I was excited to get home and see what the fuss was.  Ordered Gyro, Chicken and Lamb Combo, and the falafel salad.  I opened the chicken and Lamb first and didn't see anything mind blowing but had high hopes on the taste.  Excited to see the rest I opened up the falafel salad.  The salad looks to be made with green leaf lettuce mix but then I noticed black marks all over the salad.  I thought maybe they sauteed the salad and thought maybe some of it was charred however that was was not the case.  Upon closer inspection... I noticed that the leaves were brown/black and rotted/spoiled.  It was an appalling sight.  I had to take it back within minutes of getting it home.  I thought maybe there might be some understanding with the establishment but I was wrong.  I got back and showed the salad to the gentleman who took my order/money.  I told him it was rotted/spoiled salad and he had a shocked look when he saw it.  I also asked him if he would eat it and he didn't have a response except scramble to refund me.  Lucky me, the owner was there and the gentleman giving my refund pointed him to me.  I asked to speak to him and the owner came out and said the salad was fine.  He also then claimed that it was balsamic vinegar dressing.  I love balsamic vinegar salads and salads in general so I  have had my fair share of salads.  Ive also made many salads and have handled all types of lettuce/produce and I know what fresh salads/greens look like.  I also know what spoiled/rotting lettuce/produce looks like.  All the black and brown edges and spots were slimy and horribly wilted.  Not to mention the rotted leaves were slimy and quickly fell apart when gently rubbed between the fingers and I mean I did it gently.  Long story short, the owner claimed that his lettuce leaf was predressed with balsamic vinegar.  He then pulled out what looked to be a bulk bag/maybe 10+lbs of lettuce and there was brown juice all over with many leaves that looked horrible.  I could not believe my eyes and his bold claim that it was prepackaged balsamic vinegar salad.  He also said he could open it and allow me to taste it.  The funny thing is when I asked them if they would eat what they served me no one responded.  Maybe I'm clueless but of all the prepackaged salads I've bought, I've never once seen salads that have been predressed in the bag already.  Normally, any supplied dressing comes in a package packed in separately with the greens.  Why would the owner state this when it's a cardinal sin to have/serve soggy salad??  To think that a company would prepackage salad greens that have already been dressed in dressing that could be sitting for days/weeks and then be ok to be served is beyond my little brain.  That said, I would love to see this owner tell food services/the health department what he told me and let them confirm.  This is the first and last time I will visit this establishment.  To those that do... good luck and hopefully you don't order the \"predressed\" balsamic greens that are rotted/spoiled.  I can not believe this was the exchange/excuse provided from the owner.  I could see a worker but the Owner???  This lack of care/concern is quite disappointing and is clearly reflected in the food that they are willing to put out.  Sadly disappointed as i really wanted to support this establishment because I love this type of food!"}
{"text":"Not NY street meat but dam close!! Def worth a trip, open till 1:30am and they do enough business that the food is fresh. White sauce is legit lam is tender chicken is well seasoned"}
{"text":"Best in Charlotte!! I first had Halal food in NYC about 5-6 years ago. Ever since then, I've been searching locally for that same taste...to no avail, until late 2016...around July. I tried this cart after a meeting uptown, and it absolutely reminds me of NYC Halal food! Sooooo good! I kept forgetting to write a review, so now I've finally done it lol....but seriously, go get it! You will not be disappointed! The pics are after I mixed it all up....sorry, forgot to take a pic first! Lol"}
{"text":"Best meal we had from a food truck till now. The prices are very reasonable yet no compromise in food quality or quantity.. cash only which is not uncommon for many food trucks I guess. They have veggie options and many meat choices. I had a falafel over rice and my friend had chicken and we both liked our food a lot. Would definitely recommend..!!!"}
{"text":"After I moved to Charlotte from NYC one of the things I missed the most was Halal street food, so when I rode past this cart one day on my bike I thought at first I must be dreaming. But the smell hits you first, as with all good Halal carts, and when I saw it I immediately pulled over, parked my bike and made an order. The chicken with rice is outstanding, as is the falafel, pita, all of it. All are authentic, flavorful, fresh tasting and well executed. I've been back here several times and could probably eat here every day. Plus, the prices are very cheap -- seven bucks gets you a great meal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is great I always eat here, everyone is cool there besides this one elderly guy always has an attitude every time u ask him a question... he normally work nights! I asked if I could pay with a card and he gave me the craziest look and was very rude. I will not be eating here again! So sad because the food is very good!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to get sushi & was talking to my amazing uber driver about the Bronx & Brooklyn. He had told me how he misses the food from the city & I mentioned to him how I miss chicken & rice from the cart near Rockefeller. He told me about this spot & how it is the best chicken & rice in Charlotte. When he told me about it I immediately changed my trip. When I arrived there the moment I got out I could smell the deliciousness in the air. I placed my order but didn't have cash, the guy taking my order was so nice. He told me he would take my order & pointed me to the nearest ATM which was a min away from the cart (they are brilliant with this location). I paid them & within minutes they had my food ready. 

When I got home I felt like a kid with candy. I opened it & fell in love instantly with the food. I wish they had delivery because I would order more right now so I can eat it all day lol!!! The food is amazing & everyone should try it!!!! If you don't like it then there is something wrong with you :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best lunch in Uptown. This place is the real deal. Reminds me of the halal carts in NYC, and their food is just as good, if not better. The lamb and chicken over rice is delicious. The gyro and chicken pitas are amazing as well.  Make sure you try the yogurt sauce and the hot sauce they offer. They're usually pretty busy during lunch hours, but it's worth the wait. Only negative is they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Great falafel on pita!  Extra tzatiki given at no charge. Cheap and delicious, grateful they are open Sunday afternoon on a game day."}
{"text":"I've passed this Halal Cart several times and every time I get a bit giddy and have been dying to try it. Halal food was a staple in my post night out diet in NYC so I was excited to see one in Uptown Charlotte. Here's the run down ...  

Payment: Cash Only! C.R.E.A.M. Dolla Dolla Bills Y'all. #WuTang

Location: (5/5) Uptown on Tryon and Trade aka super convenient from any of the bars, clubs or the Epicentre

Quality: (5/5) Fresh and tasty plus I didn't get sick in the morning. You roll the dice anytime to visit a new cart in NYC

Convenience: (6/5) Went here on a Sunday night at 10:30pm! I hard to find decent food at this time

Value: (4.5/5) The various plates and meals run around $6. It's a decent amount of food but it won't feed two people or completely full you if you're hangry. NYC portions are definitely bigger and come with some pita bread on top and cost around $5-7. 

My go to order: Lamb & Chicken combo. Spicy. White Sauce. ($6)

To-Dine. Yay or Nay: Definitely Yay. Especially after a night out, it's a super yay!"}
{"text":"Horrible wait time experience. I went on a Sunday afternoon with a very small line. Someone ahead of us hard ordered about 80 items including gyros, rice dishes, etc like it was a restaurant and not a food truck with 1 cook. The cashier said 10 minutes. After 20 minutes thy were still not done with the big order and were not communicating with anyone. A fellow orderer and I asked for our money back and left. If they are going to take massive orders like that, which I personally think is ridiculous, then they should close he order window or let people know up front. Instead a bunch of people waited for a long time for what should take a matter of minutes. I live around the corner and figured this could be a nice quick bite, but I will definitely be thinking twice about that in the future, as others I shared my story with had the same issues."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Charlotte area my whole life, how is it I'm just getting around to trying this?? 

Work took me to the Omni Hotel so I finally decided to try this truck for lunch. The first thing that gets you is the delicious smell from at least a block away. I got the Chicken/Lamb combo: $6 gets you a big scoop of chicken, big scoop of Lamb, two big scoops of rice, lettuce, tomato, a tangy/creamy white sauce, and hot sauce. There was at least a 1/2lb of rice! Food was perfectly seasoned, rice, Lamb, and chicken was cooked great! I went light with the hot sauce this first time but next time I'll go how it comes, the sauce has a lot of flavor and isn't just 'in your face' spicy. Outstanding value and flavor, I'll definitely be back for more! 

Notice: Cash only, but the prices on the menu is the final price, tax included in price!"}
{"text":"All the yes...
Spicy, savory, smiling goodness.
To elaborate a smidge:

The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly. 

The food was perfect. I asked for spicy and they delivered. As simple as rice may seem, I almost always struggle with the execution. Not here. I'm still flabbergasted that 'plain' rice can be so satisfying. I'll go again, and I'm only in town for a week."}
{"text":"I'm so done with the Halal truck!! First time was great! Next couple of times, they covered my food in yogurt sauce. I'm talking about just straight poured it on where there was a good 1/2 inch puddle at the bottom of my food. Next time I asked for the yogurt sauce to be on the side since they drenched it and he POURED DIABLO sauce all over my food. Stuff is so freaking hot you can't even eat it. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food!!   The best gyro I have had in Charlotte!!  Chicken and Rice platte is great too!  Don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"The best halal I've ever had. Everything is so freaking great about the food. Chicken is cooked to perfection and the rice is not too hard or soft, always always always cooked perfectly. The hot sauce is the bomb, the young man wearing a Yankees hat is very very helpful and kind. If this food isn't good, then someone tell me where to find the next best chicken over rice. 
Ps- I went specifically downtown to eat here, that's how good it is."}
{"text":"It's no Halal guys...and it's funny how the line system is set up here. You will know when you stop by and inevitably will get confused. So to save you time during your short lunch break just go straight to the register and ignore everything else around you. Afterwards stand where ever you like until they yell out your name. Trust me this is the best way to deal with the random lines at this food truck. Food wise...I got chicken n' rice and it was pretty good. Too much sauce for my taste lol I can't believe I am saying that but there was. Note if desi get it spicy don't even ask just say spicy."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Cheap prices.

I always order the lamb and chicken combo, extra spicy. Not once have I been disappointed. You are able to walk away for only $6, and the quantity of the food is such that you will not be hungry when you are done.

Why only 4 stars? Well, they need to accept Square payments or something. After all, it's 2017.

I often rave about this place to my friends, with this sound advice as an addendum: Go early to miss the lines, and make sure you bring cash!"}
{"text":"Amazing food 
Very affordable..
Lamb over rice 
Chicken gyro are a few of my favorite. 
Love location, especially the one off university city blvd.
Only disadvantage is you need to carry cash 
They don't accept cards."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, cheap prices and great food. I suggest the chicken and lamb combo over rice ($6). if you like it spicy get the hot sauce, if you like it really spicy like I do get extra hot sauce. I eat here once a week and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"I have driven and walked past this cart a thousand times, and I can't believe as a Charlotte native I just tried this for the first time ever last night. Best falafel pita I've ever had in my entire life. Hands down. Crack pita. $6 and FIRE hot sauce!! I wish I could buy a bottle of it."}
{"text":"Have you not been here???? If not then what are you doing with your life? This. Place. Rocks. Ok so first of all if your a falafel person then you need to get there now. They make falafel on pita/salad/rice and its tah-die-for!  I cant even count on all my fingers and toes how many times (ok super late nights) my guy and I have dragged our not so sober selves to stand in the what will seem at first to be the longest line that isn't even really a line because drunk people were in charge of forming it so its a complete circus but somehow someway they guide you in take your order and off you go to enjoy your halal cart magic that will simultaneously delight and surprise and leave you wanting more and have no fear my non adult beverage indulging friends I have also had this on a few sober occasions as well and I can soberly attest to it on those days too.  I have also enjoyed the chicken dishes and my guy has raved about the gyros and phillys they offer also. This place radiates flavorful scents better than fast food joints so if you don't believe me just walk by one night on your next trip uptown and check it out for yourself and don't let the \"line\" scare you away from this little gem."}
{"text":"Great food- I personally love the falafel wrap with hot sauce- and super nice employees. Be prepared for a wait if you come during the lunch rush, though!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken over rice meal, and it was a decently sized portion. The flavors were really good, and if you like more spice, be sure to pour a ton of it on your food before you leave the stand. There was a huge chicken to rice ratio, making it way worth the $6. Call me crazy but I almost wish there was a bit more salad on the side to cleanse my palate and add some refreshing crunch to it. Still pretty damn delicious though. I couldn't finish my plate, ended up making a great lunch for the next day."}
{"text":"Brings back the good ole days when I used to hit up Halal Guys by East Village in NYC.

Cheap. Quick. Simple. Friggin Delicious.

Now that I am closer to Uptown, I come here at least once a week for their chicken and lamb combo over rice.

Here are the downsides...the small \"salad\" that typically comes with each combo is way too little to counterbalance the piles of savory protein they stack on top of your rice. Secondly, good luck with parking. Thirdly, CASH ONLY.

Now the good news is that they have a sister restaurant around Matthews that accepts credit cards, has unlimited parking, and offers huge ass portions for under 7 bucks!"}
{"text":"What to like: the convenience, location, and price. The food is is adequate but the gyro leaves you wanting more. Pro tip: bring cash since it is a cash only cart"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Extremely good and it only costs $6.  I always get the Lamb over rice, extra spice. Everyone from our office who has eaten here absolutely loves it.  Definitely needs to be part of everyone's lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Awesome Halal food truck! Every time I visit Charlotte I have to grab a quick lunch here. Super cheap and the falafel salad is bomb! The falafel is super flavorful and perfectly battered, and the sauce is delicious. Don't overlook because it's a food cart, definitely a great try!"}
{"text":"Great flavor and great price. I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was for the price. If you have ever been to Halal Guys in NYC this is almost on the same level. The combo chicken/lamb over rice with salad is the way to go. Great place to pick up lunch and they're even in Uptown on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Yes!  A chicken and lamb combo over rice with a side salad for $6?  Not only is the deal amazing, the food is tasty, too.  I asked for the spicy sauce, which gave the right amount of kick to it all.

My friends and I stopped by the cart on the way to a Panthers game - great location, great price.  Service was quick, too.  

A few minor downsides:
1. It's a cart, so we had to sit outside, and it was rather cold that day.
2. Its sanitation grade was an 86.  I didn't get sick after the meal, though... but if that's enough to prevent you from going, you've now been warned.
3. It's cash only, but that's not a big deal to me.
4. Parking - we were walking to the game anyway, so it wasn't an issue, but I could see it being a problem if we went just to eat there.  I don't think the parking is all that easy to find around there.

If you're in the uptown Charlotte area, make sure to stop by this halal cart.  Get the chicken and lamb combo over rice and you won't regret it.  I will be sure to be back."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive and convenient for anyone working in uptown. Just be forewarned that there is always a line! It's so good and worth the wait. You get a lot of food for $6. Drinks are a $1. I got the chicken and lamb combo (spicy)."}
{"text":"Run don't walk.  You really have an experience when you eat here.  This is a cash only place and that is the biggest drawback.  I really wish they would accept credit cards.

The food is simple and delicious.  The portions are generous enough.  The menu isn't diverse but what they offer they are excellent at.  I usually go for lamb and rice or the gyro.  The food is on the fatty side but I just can't get enough of it.  There is a bit of a wait, even during the sub freezing temperatures of late.

If you are in uptown this is a must stop location.  This attraction serves better food that the satellite location near UNC Charlotte.

My favorite is the lamb over rice, I am thinking about having them just put the lamb over lettuce instead.  The lamb over rice isn't a rice version of the lamb salad, but it shares a lot of flavors with the lamb gyro.  My second favorite is the lamb gyro, and this item also satisfies people who can't stand any spice (lamb over rice is a dish best served spicy).  I had the Philly cheese-steak because I wanted a point of comparison for other establishments.  The cheese-steak is alright but suffers from being smaller than the lamb over rice and costing just as much.  I also had a problem where the cheese was stuck to the wrapper and I lost some of it as a result.  See the picture."}
{"text":"I went to get convenient and tasty halal food, not to be yelled at. I specifically said no spicy when ordering, only to be reprimanded when I found out they put spicy sauce all over (I was the only one ordering at 6:30pm on this Monday night). According to them their normal is non-spicy, and any mention of the word \"spice\" would lead them to think I requested spicy. This was not the normal lunch crew and the food is still good, but a huge blow for not having done anything wrong as a customer."}
{"text":"Midnight snack or lunch time food, they have it, and they open long hours especially Thursday - Saturday nights. One issue I have when purchasing plate with salad, they usually put rice instead. Good food though"}
{"text":"I would give the food four stars but a guy in front of me ordered the \"hezbollah special\" and the guy at the counter was like yeah I got you. I take that personally, I have served several tours in the Middle East and understand hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is, I refuse to patronize any business that humors hezbollah and the terror it supports."}
{"text":"Great option for lunch uptown. My go to is the chicken over rice. A huge portion of deliciousness for only $6. Don't let the line scare you off - they move fast!"}
{"text":"Good food made to order.   Cheap.  I had chicken and rice with extra sauce and chicken.    Banging.    I ate there several times.   Really good stuff. The area is kind of annoying.  Get your food and get back in the car    Def get it to go.   Otherwise you'll have about 27 ppl hit you up for $1 if you can get past that I'd def recommend checking them out for a late night snack"}
{"text":"This food cart is DELICIOUS!  It was a life saver last night in uptown.  Their chicken philly hit the spot and was very fresh.  Next time I will try the gyros or rice plates.  They take cash only, that's the only bummer...but other than that we will most definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"What a freaking gem. I can't believe I only have come to this cart once since living in Charlotte! We were parked in the garage near Spectrum Center and got blocked in after a Hornets game. We figured \"why not just try it out?\" Best. Decision. Ever. 

I ordered the Chicken plate and the husband ordered the Chicken and Lamb combo. So much food for $12!!! We asked for the hot sauce on the side and I'm so glad we did. It has quite a kick (and I love spicy food). The white sauce they use is delicious, the guys working were super friendly, and we waited for our hot, fresh food for about 5 minutes. 

Life is good with this Halal Cart in my life."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and this place was really good. Close to the Uptown, I try to buy food here after I finish my evening classes. This place always keeps me excited. Really worth the $6."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times in the past week (mainly due to laziness and it's walking distance from my house). It's so good, cheap, and really convenient. I've had the chicken and lamb combo and the philly cheesesteak. The chicken and lamb combo is amazing, it is enough food to share with someone else or can be consumed by one if you're really hungry! The little seeds that is mixed in with the rice adds a little bit of seasoning to the chicken and lamb and the yogurt sauce poured on top of it all makes the meal! There's a little bit of lettuce that's always on the side, it makes me feel like I'm being a little bit healthy by eating it, but the meat and rice take over the entire meal. The philly was good, it is not too big and overly filled with food. Make sure you have cash, because that's all they take!"}
{"text":"For $6 you can have the most delicious and fulfilling lamb over rice or chicken/lamb over rice . . . or the best Philly cheese steak in the city. You pick. And if you like your food spicy, ask for the house hot sauce. No need to blow a hole in your wallet; grab a meal at Mi Barrio and enjoy it at any of the outdoor seating areas or parks. Cash only."}
