{"text":"Review is just for the French toast. The cafe is located inside the mall. I drove around the strip mall a while before I realized this. They had a good amount of business early in the morning. The French toast was tasty, but just really really greasy. It came with milk tea. Because I ordered 3 drinks and I was taking it to go, they provided me with a cardboard drink holder. That was a nice surprise, since I wouldn't have expected a small  food court cafe to have such amenities. Great for an early morning HK style breakfast fix. However I would need to try other dishes to see if it's worth of moving past 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place offers authentic Hong Kong, Cantonese and Singaporean food! I would  fully recommend this dining spot."}
{"text":"This place serves restaurant quality food at a foodcourt price. Tax is already included in the prices so that's a bonus! 

I'd warn you that the presentation of the food is questionable.. but no doubt, the flavors and textures are better than average. I had the Spaghetti and meat sauce ($6) which had a very sweet and savory sauce. The noodles were cooked al dente and the ratio of sauce to noodles was perfect for a saucy bite every time. 
My dad ordered the Satay beef vermicelli, which came with an egg sandwich ($5.50). Appearance-wise.. The bowl was pretty bland and lacking in ingredients. I was upset to see that it didn't even have the frozen peas/corn/carrot mix that most places offer. But regardless, the broth was flavorful and the vermicelli was a nice bouncy texture. The egg sandwich also wasn't bad. With the crust removed, the bread was soft and the layers of egg were fluffy.

A considerable place for a meal sitting at around $6."}
{"text":"Tasty and great value! Best HK style eatery. I have already had the beef noodles, portuguese chicken, club sandwich and next I will try their bolognese on spaghetti. Prices cannot be beat and meals come with a drink :) the lady at cash is also very nice. Looking forward to my next meal, thank you Yelp and Yelpers for the great places, feedback and pics!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place, in the food court, a few times now. We came today and ordered the Singapore Vermicelli, black pepper chicken steak on rice and deep fried chicken wings. The fried noodle dishes here are outstanding, better than a lot of high end restaurants. The Singapore Vermicelli had really good flavour with a bit of spice, not greasy or wet. It was a good serving size, only criticism is its a bit lacking in protein, but it's only $6.50 inc tax and a hot drink. The rice dish wasn't very good, rice was a bit clumpy and hard, sauce was a bit salty. Chicken wings were ok, not great or really bad. I've tried the curried fish balls before and they weren't very good.
A fantastic place for their fried noodle dishes, I've tried dry beef ho fan before. Rice dishes are ok and snack foods, I'd give a miss."}
{"text":"I got to Chartwell at about 6:30pm. I was feeling lazy and didn't really want to cook dinner nor lunch for tomorrow so I ventured to the food court after some quick shopping at Dollarama. My parents love coming here and so do I. The food is generous, cheap, and is served rather quickly. The owners used to own serve different types of Chinese food at Chartwell but didn't do as well as offering Chinese HK Cafe style food. 

I ordered the black pepper chicken with rice and it comes with 2 generous sized pan fried chicken thighs along with about a bowl of rice. The combo also comes with your choice of soup, soy milk, or hot HK milk tea/lemon tea/HK milk tea+coffee hybrid. I paid $6.50 which included taxes. The chicken skin is delightfully crispy and the meat is juicy. The one thing that would make this better is if it came with veggies. I usually boil some bok choy or broccoli and then split the meal into 2. For $6.50, I can't complain because you can't buy most appetizers for $6.50. 

On Sundays this food court gets crazy packed at around noon because people who go to church across the street usually eat at the food court right after Sunday service. The owner recommended that my parents come before the rush (around 11) and order take out."}
{"text":"The Singapore curry rice noodle is so good!!! And the lemon honey tea tastes incredibly authentically Hong Kongnese!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong Style Tea and Fast Food checks off all the requirements for a great HK style food place...

Fast?    Check!
Cheap??  Check!!
Delicious???  Check!!!

The wok hei flavour you get here is excellent and better then most high end restaurants.  All meals comes with a drink with an option to upgrade the drink and are tax included.

The specials on the white board provide great value and the owner will suggest what's the best tasting item of the day.

Definitely a great place grab some great HK style food!"}
{"text":"Consistently good products. Have yet to experience a bad food day when visiting.   Service is fast, good is plentiful,  great flavors and all for a very reasonable price.   My plan is to try every item on their menu to see their week link.   The lady cashier if asked will tell you what is freshest of the day and many times that resolves my \"what do I want\" dilemma. The cold drink upgrade for 75 cents is definitely worth it if you are a fan of iced lemon tea. .. yum!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong Style Tea & Fast Food now officially becomes a regular takeout place for some solid eat.

I dare to say their Stir Fried Beef Rice Noodle ($6) is one of the best I had. Even better than those $18 ones served in higher end Chinese restaurant. So well prepared and full of wok hay. 

Service always fast and friendly. 

Everything Tax in.

And if you want extra bowls to share, they have reusable plastic bowl available with no cost.

All meals includes a hot drink and upgrade to a cold one cost 75 cents."}
{"text":"Great price and value for generous portions!

Ordered stir fry beef rice noodles for $6.50 with hk tea. Got to say it's pretty good. Make sure you are okay with this dish because it's oily.

Forgot to mention the amount of beef is just about right. Definitely some place to go if you like hk food."}
