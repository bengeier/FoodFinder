{"text":"It seems most Food Lion stores are rather small & don't carry a lot of better items forcing me to go to the overpriced Harris Teeter.  This location is decent.  The employees are very nice here which is why I go to this location rather than the other one in the same town."}
{"text":"This location is great! The building and parking lot are always clean, the building is well lit, products are always in stock, and the staff are great! This is my preferred grocery store, even though it is a further drive for me."}
{"text":"They recently reconfigured some of this store.  The deli & produce section is much brighter & more spacious.  The shelves have some better items - organic, fresher, less preservatives.  They clearly expanded their brands."}
