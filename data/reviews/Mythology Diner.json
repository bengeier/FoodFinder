{"text":"Overall experience 4/5
For an appetizer we ordered, Save the Calamari for the Ocean..table said they loved it & it didn't last long. Along with an order of, Wings are for flying...we had the BBQ...which I enjoyed! 
For the Main Course my friend(s) ordered The Reubenator which both people raved about. We also had the, Alfredo done right which my friend seemed to enjoy...he's quieter so you don't get much out of him. And for myself, I had It's a tall stack (pancakes). For the price...I would reconsider.  They're pancakes lol
Alcohol is way over priced! ...$9 for a Beau's...nope!"}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to have an identity crisis....diner decor, classy menu and loud urban music. We were given a table for 2 and our party had 3 people. We had to physically turn the table around so we could make more space. We asked for an extra chair and were told no. We eventually got another chair by asking someone else. The calamari, garlic bread and fettuccine were good. The wings, ruben and NY steak were not good. The portions were small except the
for the steak. The music was so loud we could barely have a conversation, even at our 2 person table. It was a really disappointing vegan experience....$160 later. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Service: lovely
Food: calamari (delish especially once you put lemon on it)
-Buffalo wings (not spicy. A bit sweet)
-Steak (soooooo good! Especially the outside edges of it!)
-Caesar salad (yummy but not remarkable)
-French onion soup (good but not great) 

$117 (4 drinks as well) with taxes not including tip.

I would go back for the calamari and steak. Eager to try other dishes. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"The staff are great. Very friendly and helpful. It started off great with boneless vegan chicken wings. They were great. Better than Hogtown vegans. The onion soup was nice and not as rich as your typical onion soup. The chicken pot pie tasted like there was uncooked flour spread throughout it. The tempeh fish tasted better as leftovers the next day. It's great that it's vegan but they need to improve the flavour."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom. She had a problem because we were seated by the door and every time someone opened it we would feel the cold air. It was pretty cold in the place. Not very nice, lol. we ordered the garlic bread and french onion soup to start. Both were very good and had good portions. Next, I ordered the \"meatloaf\" and my mom ordered the \"steak\" as the food arrived we were excited because it was a lot of food, very good potions. We tried the sides first (garlic mashed potatoes, veggies) and they were good! My mom took one bite of the steak and she didn't want to eat anymore. She let me try it and it was horribly salty. The server was sweet and got her another one but that one only seemed to be worse. There was so much marinade or whatever that it was just overwhelming. And my meatloaf was more like a loaf of unseasoned stuffing. It was not very good and it was sort of soggy. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I don't think it was that. I ordered a sundae for desert and a server that was not originally ours brings me a scoop of ice cream!! A scoop!! I ordered a sundae. So I told her I ordered it and she went and brought me my sundae. It was good but you'd have to be talented to mess up a sundae. Overall a pretty bad experience. I wouldn't recommend it to people. Go next door to doomies!!!! 100x better. ?"}
{"text":"A brand new and very hip, vegan diner has opened up in Parkdale! 

Mythology Diner is beyond adorable. The food is great and the service is excellent. (Diana makes great cocktails and makes excellent recommendations btw!) 

I have been to Mythology Diner three times and MD delivers! First, the food tastes good. Second, the food looks like it was made with love. 

Here's a rundown on what I've had:

\"Save the calamari for the ocean\"
These are delicious, breaded oysters mushrooms, perfectly crispy with a tangy, creamy tartar sauce that makes you want more! 

\"Reubenator\" with crispy fries
This is a classic take on the smoked meat sandwich. The filling was plentiful and had a very a very nice chewy texture and taste. The fresh rye bread was great. 

\"Vienna Salisbury Steak\" & loaded baked potato
This dish is so delicious. It has a nice balance of savoury, salty, tangy and herb flavours. The steak is crispy and salty and goes perfectly with the silky cheesy baked potato and savoury gravy. I would have this dish again happily! Check out my pics! 

Our friends raved about the veggie meat loaf and the blooming onion and I must admit their dishes looked amazing. I plan on going back to taste them. 

Go and enjoy and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of everything Doug McNish touches. His Public Kitchen has to be one of, if not THE best vegan restaurant in the city. So naturally, when we found out he was partnering with the Doomies gang, we HAD to try out his new diner! 

We arrived at about 7:00 on a Friday evening, and were told it would be about an hour wait for a table. Just over an hour later, we were texted that our table was ready, and we waited a further five minutes to actually sit, as they were quite busy telling other guests about their wait. It might have been better to have more than one person at the door. 

Once seated, we were approached by a friendly waitress who was happy to recommend items from the appetizer menu. We settled on the barbecue wings, and they did not disappoint. Holy moley, they were delicious! I ordered the \"fish\" and chips, which was very tasty but came with far too little tartar sauce. When I asked for a bit more, I was told I would be charged $2 (hey, at least she was kind enough to alert me). So I passed, but did not finish the food because it just wasn't as tasty without the tartar sauce. Wish they would provide enough in the first place. Sigh. The fries were a little salty, but standard. Not quite as good as Doomie's. My hubby ordered the meatloaf, which was delicious, covered in a delightful gravy. I kept nibbling off his plate. 

The atmosphere was unpleasant, as there  was a DJ spinning hip hop, 80s and 90s tunes. The tunes were fine, but it was just far too loud. We couldn't even hear ourselves think, let alone have a conversation beyond nodding to each other about how tasty our meals were. I imagine brunch would be quieter? I hope to find out!

Overall our experience here was very good, and we were satisfied with service, etc. But for the price, I would hope that in future they maybe consider offering a little extra sauce here and there, or just providing ample in the first place. That and the noise were really our only complaints. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We had a top notch meal at Mythology. I've had many vegan Reuben sandwiches and the housemade pastrami was like none other, both visually and texturally. It was red, sliced thon, and piled high. 

We started with the boneless wings, king oyster calamari, and cheesey garlic bread. The calamari was the crispy, hot, and came with two sauces. My partner, who has never been a big mushroom person, loved the corneal crusted king oyster rings. The wings were crispy and sweet served with celery, carrot sticks, and bleu cheese in proper Buffalo fashion. The garlic bread was delicious but not what I pictured. 

We got the NY Strip with loaded baked potato in addition to the Reuben. The steak was extremely juicy and flavorful. The baked potato was cooked perfectly, had a log of cheddar nestled in the middle, was drizzled with delicious sour cream and topped with bacon bits and green onion.

There are no reservations but at 7:30 on a Thursday, we were immediately offered seat at the bar. The place is a bit loud, so I was glad we opted to sit next to each other at the bar rather than across a table."}
{"text":"This place was amazing: good service and good food. The food came really fast and it was delicious. 
We had the Bloomer and Save the calamari for the ocean to start, and both were amazing, just perfectly deep fried.
We then tried the NY Strip and it was really good: big portion, nice seasoning, perfectly charred. Seitan steak is a tough thing to pull off, but this was really flavourful and not at all boring. We enjoyed every single bite. We also tried the Alfredo Done Right, and while it was really good, I think next time we'll try something different, something a little more \"adventurous\" (also, it could have used a little more mushrooms). 
Now the dessert: The lemon meringue pie was amazing! Tart, flavourful and the meringue was nice and fluffy. We also tried the cheesecake bites which were very tasty but could have used some more filling. 
Will come back for sure as I can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how your meatloaf was prepared last night, but as soon as I left the restaurant my stomach felt weird. Sure enough this morning, it's all come back up ."}
{"text":"Vegan dishes can be tough but Mythology has done a great job and taking known classics and making them a great vegan alternative.  My club was as close to the classic as you could get.  The crowd is good indication of it being popular.  Give them a try if you want to eat healthier or looking to get into vegan food."}
{"text":"I have to say wow! This is was a great experience and worth the wait. The hype machine is in full effect and for good reason. This menu is bananas and anyone who has ever made any bullshit excuse for not eating/going vegan could be pummelled into submission by the sheer delicacy of this menu. So many great options that will appeal to the hardcores on either end of the spectrum. I highly recommend starting with the Wings Are For Flying, but there are no bad choices on this menu and that includes the cocktails which you should also indulge in while you're there."}
{"text":"On a weekday night, my family and I came to Mythology Diner and we were surprised at how busy they were. We didn't feel like waiting so we settled for the two person table although we were three. 

The restaurant itself has a really cool look, it's got dim lighting and really cool designs all over- including a glowing sign and light set up. It's VERY SMALL! There are tables and then a bar, so wouldn't say it's good for bigger groups. 

We ordered three mains: Alfredo Done Right, The Vienna Salisbury Steak, and the NY Strips. Of the three, the NY strips tasted the best, it was very smokey! Tasted very much like real steak!! The Alfredo tasted just like real alfredo- so creamy and smooth! If you're in the mood for your classic (vegan) alfredo, this dish is definitely one to try. The Vienna Salisbury Steak was less tasty the the rest. It was a chickpea patty so it broke very easily and didn't have an amazing texture. We got the apple crumble and it tasted like your average apple crumble which isn't a bad thing. I think this restaurant had the flavours spot on for most of their dishes! 

Definitely plan on coming back, although their prices aren't the friendliest on a student's wallet! Excited to try more of their delicious looking dishes!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I was so excited about the opening of Mythology. We waited for an hour and a half (party of 3) and ordered a bunch of dishes, some were great and some were disappointing. The chicken wings, fries, and cheesecake dippers were delicious. The burger, Mac and cheese, and Cobb salad were disappointing."}
{"text":"This is probably the best vegan restaurant I've been to- if there's one vegan restaurant I'd suggest to anyone, I'd be this. Thought it is quite on the pricey side, the food is so delicious and makes you feel super luxurious  
Ordered the garlic bread and the pulled pork sandwich and my boyfriend who isn't vegan thought it tasted exactly like real meat ! 
Though we had to wait a few minutes to be seated down, it was very worth it and usually when you come in groups of 2-3, they can be seated at the bar.
Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Although the food is amazing, the inability to make reservations and the wait time made eating at this establishment a little frustrating. Being from the states, we were unable to participate in their \"text when your table is ready\" seating system. If the restaurant was to update their system to allow international numbers our experience would have been much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Thursday night with two friends. We showed up right at 5:30pm and were able to get a table without waiting. The decor is very fun, the music was very loud and didn't fit the retro decor. It was hard to hold a conversation at a regular level.
To be honest, I wasn't overly excited about the menu to begin with. I love going to vegan restaurants where I can eat anything on the menu, but this one wasn't very exciting. 
I ordered the steak, as I've had delicious, melt in your mouth seitan steaks before. But this one was not one of them. When my plate came out, I was already disappointed. The 'steak' looked like the rubber sole of a shoe. And it didn't taste any better. It was very dense, chewy, rubbery and the only flavour it had was salt (and too much salt). The garlic butter was mostly just minced garlic, no butter or creaminess to it. The mashed potatoes and veggies were fine, but the whole plate was not worth its $20 price tag.
One friend ordered the tempeh and chips. Unfortunately, she was not impressed with her food either. The fries weren't exciting and kind of mushy. I tasted the tempeh fish, and it had barely any flavour, just the slightest bit of lemon but really it was like eating nothing. Again, so disappointing.
My other friend ordered the Alfredo pasta. She enjoyed it and it looked fine, but ultimately it was pasta with mushrooms and a creamy sauce. I didn't taste it so I can't comment.
For dessert I ordered the chocolate ice cream sundae. It was very tiny and the ice cream was not creamy at all. In fact, the entire sundae was tasteless. The only good part were the three raspberries on top. Don't bother wasting $9 on this dessert. Just stop off at the grocery store on your way home and pick up a delicious pint of creamy coconut or cashew ice cream for $7 on your way home instead.
The staff was fine, the restaurant was clean. But the food was tasteless and not worth the money. I might give this place a try for brunch, but I won't be rushing back for dinner at all. Although, my plan was to order the cinnamon bun pancakes for dinner, but I changed that when I saw they used Yoso cream cheese. Again, there are better options. And I would be more impressed with a homemade cream cheese. However, with my rubber sole shoe steak, maybe I should have gone with pancakes.
Vegans and those who love them, there are much better places in the city to spend your hard earned money on delicious food, and this isn't one of them. Too bad."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan addition to Parkdale. Great service and all of the classic diner food made vegan. I really appreciated the detail in plating, and the quality of the food. Even the bread for the daily soup was delicious. I also had the vegan Cobb salad which was super filling. The vegan egg was unlike anything I've had before. Excellent service as well. I recommend coming right at 5:30. We came at 5:30 and the place was already full."}
{"text":"So this was a complete surprise! Didn't know this place was vegan until I walked in and saw the word \"vegan.\" There's parking on the street and this place wasn't too busy on a Tuesday night around 7pm.

The Server - think her name was Diana - was incredibly knowledgeable when it came to asking her about the best items on the menu. I've never had a Server go through the entire menu like that in so much detail.  Amazing! 

Main Course: 
Doug's Classic Burger with Creamy Garlic Mash was so delicious. The burger was so perfect and I've missed having burgers because it's so hard to find a good vegetarian or vegan burger these days at the regular fast food joints. I asked for ketchup, mayo and hot sauce to put inside my burger which the Server happily brought me. This burger is messy and big but delicious. I'd recommend having jalapenos or banana peppers. I asked for those and the Server said they just didn't have either - pity. 

The Creamy Garlic Mash needed a little bit of work. I would ask this place to consult The Keg. A friend got the fries instead of the mash (he ordered the same Burger) and I was disappointed in the fries. They were too much and not quality fries at all. How about reducing the fries portion and increasing the quality a little Mythology? Make them more rich in potato-like texture - soft but still a little crispy. 

Dessert: 
Little Cheesecake Dippers were so delicious. The presentation was amazing and I loved that dip! They are great if you are sharing and don't really have a sweet tooth but just want a little sugar after your meal."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Mythology and had previously attempted to come here with a group of friends on a Saturday night to be met with an impossibly long wait.  I arrived at 6:30 this Saturday and since we were just two we sat at the bar.  

The concept of the restaurant, as suggested by the name, is vegan diner comfort food.  I appreciated the creativity of the menu choices (and names) and the effort to encourage meat eaters to try vegan restaurants.  We shared the quesadillas to start.  It wasn't really what I was expected - I was expecting gooey vegan cheese and veggies but it was all mushed beans.  The lime crema on the side was amazing.  For mains, we got the mac and cheese and the reuben.  As someone who can't have dairy (and does eat some meat), I look forward to vegan restaurants so I can eat items that would normally be covered in cheese.  The mac and cheese also didn't do it for me.  It wasn't creamy and didn't taste cheesy.  I have tried vegan mac all over the city so this less than stellar review isn't because my expectations are too high or that I am comparing it to the real thing (since I can't eat that anyways!).  I liked the bread crumbs on top and that it came in a cast iron skillet but I had to send it back because despite the dish feeling hot on the outside, the middle was cold.  They were really apologetic and offered to bring me out another app in the interim which I turned down because I wasn't that hungry but really appreciated the gesture.  The reuben was great - totally tasted like the real thing (although it's been 10+ years since I have had red meat but if memory serves me correctly).  The spices and texture were right on point.

For dessert, I had a scoop of almond bark ice cream since I can never say no to dairy-like dessert at a vegan restaurant.  All in all, I wouldn't come back but definitely worth trying and a twist from the stereotypical \"healthy\" vegan choices out there."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours to be seated. No apology was given for the wait since the host said the wait time was 40 minutes originally. The food was mediocre and nothing special. 
Unfortunately, the experience was overwhelming and overpriced."}
{"text":"We came here after checking out a post on Instagram by James Aspey. The place is right beside Doomies, same owner. We ordered the NY steak, wings, and a burger. The burger was alright, but the steak tasted so legit it's scary, same goes for the wings. Safe to say this is the best steak and wings I ever had! I'm not exaggerating!

Everything on the menu is under $20. Decent portions. Quality food. Friendly service. Fancy AF. Overall I'm glad to check it out. Best vegan restaurant in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Maybe I was feeling extra picky this day, but I was pretty disappointed by Mythology, which sucks, as I was so looking forward to it. 
I visited on a super cold Saturday night and I had the burger, one of my friends had the reuben, and another friend had the meatloaf. They were decent dishes, but nothing that really made us say \"wow\" or would draw us to come back for them. We agreed to try the brunch one day to see how we felt about it, but otherwise, we may try a different vegan place over Mythology another time."}
{"text":"After trying Doug's public kitchen for brunch and absolutely loving it, my best friend and I were beyond excited to find out that a diner by the same owner was opening. Our standards were pretty high but this restaurant went way beyond our expectations. We started by sharing a sweet onion soup, which was extremely delicious and flavourful, followed by what we agreed to be the best burger of our lives and finally we finished it off with the cinnamon bun pancakes which were just perfect. The retro ambiance and 80's music makes everything even better than it already is. Doug really killed the game and we will definitely be coming back soon to try that Mac n Cheese... so worth the two hour commute!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really exciting. Doug McNish is a true chef and a bit of a mad scientist and what he's doing with food is amazing! 

In particular, he is the master of vegan eggs. I had the cobber salad, which included a hardboiled vegan egg on top. It must be some molecular gastronomy going on because it's the only vegan hard boiled egg I've ever seen. The texture was awesome! Maybe it was made with chickpea flour or something? I couldn't tell but it was good and the salad was all around delicious with wonderful textures and flavour. 

I also had the vegan mac n' cheese. Darn good. I make a pretty stellar mac n' cheese of my own so I wasn't as wowed by this as by the salad and the dessert (keep reading) but it was really good and at the next table they said it was the best vegan mac n' cheese they'd ever had so voila. Solid. 

My friend had the vegan meatloaf which I tried and it was delicious, as were the fixins that came with it. It doesn't come with ketchup so ask for ketchup if you want to really do it the old school way. Loved the mushroom gravy with it. 

Dessert was the show-stopper; the vegan lemon meringue pie was phenomenal. It was a fluffy cloud of meringue goodness--again, Doug McNish is the master of vegan eggs--with the tart lemon that you want without it being too sweet. we split it and half was perfect for each of us.

The only thing was the super loud gangster music. Not conducive to the rest of the experience. It got louder as the night went on. I have voice problems so it was hard, plus that music is just such a particular taste and for me and my friend it was kind of brutal.   

The place just opened so it's going to be long lines for several months but totally worth it. A++"}
{"text":"Mythology wasn't BAD per say, it just wasn't great.  I went with my BFF on a Friday night.  We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, but it was 45.  No big deal, it happens.

The seats are very close together, so if you use any kind of mobility device, this is going to be an issue in here.  I didn't use the bathroom, so I can't speak to it's gendered-ness or accessibility.  The music was very loud and my friend and I needed to yell over the 90's Bad Boy hip hop to converse.  

My BFF did the ordering, as she had done some studying on Bunz and decided we needed to try the steak and the Alfredo.  I got to choose the appetizer and went with the Calamari.  The Calamari had good texture but the breading wasn't spiced, which I found odd.  The tartar sauce was delicious but the serving size was stingy.

Our steak and Alfredo were okay but nothing to write home about.  Both came decorated with flower pedals, which were unnecessary and kept sliding into the dishes.  The steak was okay, but honestly, eating it as an entire meal was boring.  It wasn't really spiced  and wasn't a memorable seitan dish.  The alfredo was okay, but it didn't feel like something special or even great.  It was okay, but felt like a meal my friend would make for me, not something I'm paying 20$ a plate for and waiting for.

I also ordered a cocktail, a Lavender Crush, and it was just awful.  Once again, there were pedals, this time, in the drink itself.  

There's nothing WRONG with Mythology, but Doug McNish is a great cook and this food just isn't great.  It's okay, but I wont' be returning."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch.  Got lucky and had no wait, although we sat at the bar.

Delicious.  I had Croque Madame (or something like that) and my wife had a croissant with scrambled tofu.

Not cheap though, $50 for two people for brunch (no alcohol)."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed everything ordered. I've had a few Reuben sandwiches at different vegan restaurants and this is by far the tastiest. The portions are good for what you pay for, and worth whatever the wait may be."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! It was such a disappointment which was so upsetting because I was following them on instigram from the first say eager to check it out. I finally went with my friend and it was horrific! The place is significantly smaller than shown in the pictures and the food is gross.

I ordered the wings, garlic cheese bread and pancakes and my friend ordered the calamari and the pasta dish. The garlic cheese bread and calamari were very good but the rest was gross. The wings tasted like rubber. The pasta was oily and bland and the pancakes were gross. HOW DO YOU F**K UP PANCAKES???

It was a very disappointing experience. 

Places that are better:
Fresh on Eglinton 
Hogtown 
Grasshopper 
Veggie delight 

Don't eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype. We have some amazing vegan restaurants in metro-Boston, so our standards are high for vegan restaurants and this new restaurant lived up to its hype. Delicious food and drinks, friendly staff, even the sign (see picture) was awesome. Toronto has a great selection of vegan friendly restaurants and this one is great even by Boston vegan restaurant standards."}
{"text":"I've now been two times to Mythology since it opened and I think I want to move in. I'll sleep behind the bar if I have to. The food is incredible, especially the Reubenator and Calamari! As a vegan I haven't tasted these flavors in years. Thanks for that! The play list is a great time and decore is beautiful. The staff is so kind, the manager took time to talk to each table. So professional. I'm very excited to see more and more compassionate restaurants opening up!"}
{"text":"Vegan food done A+++. The only thing I'd hope for is few less deep fried options and some more healthier choices. Doug is up to his masterful self exuding flavor and ingenuity in every dish he prepares. For vegans and non vegans this place is a must for anyone who likes REAL food."}
{"text":"This place checks all the hipster boxes; charcoal in the water, paper straws, kold draft ice cubes, Boylans soda... So good. So cute.

It's the slightly less preachy sister to Doomies (which I also love) as it's decorated more diner and less vegan comics. And the service staff are great. So friendly and helpful and lovely.

The food is a bit mixed, depending on what you get, and what you're into. The Reuben is amazing, and absolutely pleased the meat eaters in the group. The burger is huge, and while not mock meat per se, it's totally satisfying. The mac and cheese is a bit weird and has a tangy kind of flavour... If you're a nutritional yeast kinda vegan, it's fine. For those expecting cheesy, you may be disappointed.

Their breakfasts are imaginative and something pretty unique for vegans, but totally familiar faves for omnivores. Filling, too. 

There's even a bunch on the menu that's gluten-free. It's honestly the kind of place we've gone with any dietary type and kept everyone happy. Gets a bit crazy on the weekends, but weekdays are totally civilized."}
{"text":"Do not recommend 
Tried it twice 
Doing you a favour 
Food is a terrible vegetarian alternative 
Very pricey 
Noisy place/ not comfortable 
Waiting time is excessive 
Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty busy. Where to put your name down for a table was confusing. We just stood in the middle of the place until someone came up to us. Wait time was about 30 minutes, which was expected. We actually came to this restaurant by accident. We wanted to go to Doomie's, which is next door, but whatever.

We were sat at the bar. There wasn't much arm space as the location was small. Also, the people next to us were complaining about how there was no meat on the menu. Absolutely ridiculous considering the place is labeled as vegan and is in Vegandale. They were also very rude to our server, which made me feel bad. 

The mashed potatoes were bland. The iced hot chocolate had a little bit of a spicy kick. I liked it, but my friend did not. It depends on preference, as does everything in life. The mac and cheese was crusted with breadcrumbs, which I really enjoyed. My friend seemed to like his burger and the fries were decent.

Overall, fine place. Nothing outstanding and prices were a little steep. It's nice to see full vegan restaurants and supporting them is necessary. I would go back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a four or five star rating, but I have to admit that I was disappointed by some of the food and the experience in general.

We arrived as soon as the restaurant opened, so we were seated quickly. People who came even half an hour after opening were forced to wait quite a while. 

We ordered:
-calamari with tartar sauce (5/5)
-kale Caesar salad (3/5) 
-steak with veggies (2.5/5) 
-Mac and cheese (2/5) 
-soup of the day (5/5) 

The calamari was out of this world! It was gluten free, which was a bonus! I highly recommend this. The kale Caesar didn't resemble Caesar salad at all, and we wished they had used romaine instead. The steak was awfully bitter for some reason, which made the meal difficult to finish. The veggies were well enjoyed, though. 

I had the macaroni and cheese and was thoroughly disappointed in it. It was absolutely bland and did not live up to the description on the menu. The breadcrumb topping was excessive, since all I tasted in the dish was bread. The dish was so bland that I thought perhaps they actually forgot to taste it and merely salt it before plating and serving it. The soup of the day was a red pepper soup with cashew cream, and it was perfectly seasoned and well balanced. 

As others have noted, the music was WAYYYY too loud and I heard almost every customer complaining about this amongst themselves. It ruined the experience. Staff was friendly and accommodating, which helped. 

I recommend visiting Mythology Diner for the calamari and side dishes. I would like to go back and try the French onion soup and the meatloaf, since these have been highly rated. I hope the restaurant looks into these reviews and addresses the issues."}
{"text":"i was excited to take my friend here for her first time but it ended in disappointment. we had the garlic bread with this melty cashew milk butter and cheese to start, it was so delicious i wish the pieces were bigger. 

my friend had the tempeh fish n chips, she said the texture felt more like chicken nuggets. with the dill sauce i think it tasted like a fried piece of fish, that and the fries were slammin. the fries were dead cold though!

i got the ny strip , which was a thick piece of seitan, and garlic mashed potatoes withgreen beans. my food was cold wheni got it. the seitan was excessively salty and wheni mentioned to server she said that she heara that a lot andhas already informed the chef but they continue to over season it. the couple beside us had the ny strip as well and agreed. i could barely take a few bites of it. the lady next to us barely ate hers either. it was so salty i couldnt finish my meal i was really turned off. 

dont get the ny strip it was $20 and you wont be able to eat it!"}
{"text":"This was the first time trying a restaurant that replicates the taste of meat and I was impressed. 
We arrived exactly when they opened for dinner-5.30pm, however our intention was to get there a bit later but thank god we didn't because by 6pm there was a huge line-up at the door.
We started off with the wings and chose the barbeque sauce to go with it. The wings arrived within 5 minutes. They really got the texture of the \"wings\" on point, it was pretty unbelievable. For mains, I went for the burger, which was made from tempeh and mushrooms and topped with barbeque sauce and caramelized onions, with a side salad. My friend chose the reubenator with fries. This took around 10-15 minutes to make, which was not bad.  
The serving size was the right amount, and not as big as I thought it would be. My burger was delicious but extremely messy, where you have to eat with with a fork and knife if you don't want the patty to spill all over. The burger patty tasted like a typical vegetable-based one you would get anywhere...nothing special and I have had better. My only compalint was the texture, where it was just too soft and messy...but still tasty. However, my friend was crazy about his reuben sandwich and said that it tasted like actual corned beef.
The prices were slightly steep but the taste, service and ambiance made up for it. The dessert options looked amazing, but we were quite full to get any. 
As we were paying I heard the server telling a customer in line that the wait should be one hour or more! So I definitely recommend going early or when you aren't starving.
All in all, Mythology is a great vegan restaurant and one that I will visit again so that I can then try the NY steak, which looked crazy good!"}
{"text":"Overrated. The food is fine, not great. If you were a fan of Grasslands or Fressen you may like this. Ambience leaves something to be desired. Service is slow and inattentive and they play (inexplicably) awful pop/R&B music completely out of sync with"}
{"text":"Proper Vegan spot right next door to the Doomie's. I had their stuffed Stuffed Berry Marscapone French toast, . It comes w/ tempeh bacon & your choice of house mixed green salad or herbed redskin home fries. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.

I had the fettucine alfredo which was so bland. Last time I checked salt and garlic were vegan  - get it in there. I added some of the seitan steak which was just gross. My friends had the french onion soup which they both really enjoyed. We also had the kale caesar salad which was blah. The dressing was very bland and there wasn't enough of it on the salad. It was like eating wet kale. Rootbeer float was good but that isn't cooking.

Doomie's menu is better.

Nice staff, cute looking diner, but the food was not great I can cook way better than this."}
{"text":"Food was good-expensive. Portions very adequate. Clean, very modern restaurant.French fries were lukewarm, but we were kindly given a discount.Disappointed at the end of the meal. we were talking at our table, paid the bill and then were asked to leave as there were people waiting for tables. I find that very rude!. If there is a time limit to stay at the tables, You should be told when you arrive or there should be a sign to advise of time limit at tables. Very embarrassing, as I had taken 2 friends there for a celebration. I have never been asked to leave at any other vegan restaurant and many of them were much busier than Mythology. Not happy about this!!!"}
{"text":"It's mostly a vegan place that caters to vegans. But I imagine most meat eaters wouldn't be impressed. The steak is a lightly charred piece of seitan, for example. What's most amazing is that it costs $20! The Reuben was bland and soggy. 

I consider it a novelty thing, but I wouldn't rush back to try anything else."}
{"text":"Had Vienna Salisbury steak tonight and I would have licked my plate if I could have gotten away with it. Next time I'll give no f***s and lick that plate!"}
{"text":"A group of us went on opening night (an hour wait). I've got to say it was well worth the wait. The staff was extremely pleasant to deal with and offered great service. The food was so well made and tasted great. We will definitely be going back there to try the other dishes. The decor is very tasteful and the ambience created a wonderful experience. The only downside was that the music was way too loud and you couldn't hear the person next to you.
The wings and calimari we ordered for appetizers were seasoned to perfection. After our meals, chef Doug McNish thanked us for coming. He's a very humble and down to earth person. Great experience!"}
