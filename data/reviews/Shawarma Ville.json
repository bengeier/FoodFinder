{"text":"Decided to go here on recommendation....was not disappointed! Delicious shawarma! Great customer service, very fresh product. Highly recommended giving it a try."}
{"text":"Love their shawarma so much! We ordered take out and eat it at home many times! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came here because we were in the area and decided to give it a go. Ordered two chicken shawarma plates and the cleanliness of the restaurant is questionable. The food was below average and didn't seem like the traditional shawarma plate we can get in Scarborough. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times now. Seems the orders always get mixed up which is not a problem for me but one of my friends is a vegetarian and it is a problem for him. The staff is super polite and accommodating. Lentil soup was not prepared and it was 1:30pm. Just seems very unorganized. Phone in orders seem to get confused. I just do not see myself going here again."}
{"text":"This is the only shawerma in town; conviniently located across the street from Go station. We got take out a number of times for shawerma sandwiches and entrees. Meat is very flavourful; however, couple times; I bit into chunks of chicken skin/fat which was a big turn off. 
All things considered; will dine again when I am craving shawerma as it's close by"}
