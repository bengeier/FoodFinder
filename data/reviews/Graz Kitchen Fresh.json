{"text":"GRAZ is a great independent sandwich shop.  The food is very fresh and the menu has some unique combinations for sandwiches. A good alternative to the chains.

You feel like you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times to grab a coffee before my nail appointment that's a few doors down. I can say that the coffee is really good just black! It's way better tasting than Starbs. The owner is always friendly! Cute place. When I have more time, I'll be back for one of their sandwiches that people rave about."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything is so fresh and has amazing flavor! The Italian and Flying Pig sandwiches are so good! The grilled tomatoes really make the sandwich! For breakfast there are several sandwich and oatmeal (steel cut) options and if you really want a treat get a fresh made bun or cinnamon roll. I have had both the sweet and savory buns and both are fantastic. The sides are the usual chips and sides salads with one exception...THE KALE SLAW! It is the best! If you don't think you are a \"kale person\" this is your step to liking it. Not your typical slaw...no mayo but instead a sweet honey vinegarette so you can eat the whole thing without the guilt! 

Skip the large \"chain\" sandwich shops and support this local one...well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned place.

Fresh and healthy 
I recommend adding turkey to their Athena grilled sandwich. It's my favorite there."}
{"text":"Kitchen Fresh is right! Simply amazing. My sister brought me here raving about their sandwiches. I got the Green Goddess and added turkey, and man was she right! Full of flavor and personality. 
What really impressed me was how friendly everyone was. You can tell the owner loves to take care of his customers. To the point of even wrapping our leftovers for us to take home. It's a sandwich spot meets bistro! Im defiantly returning!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and had breakfast sandwiches at Gr?z this morning. Marcus behind the counter was great to talk too, he was very personable while preparing our sandwiches. 
We had the Fly Me to the Moon and Morning Glory. Both sandwiches were outstanding and we can't wait to go back. Looking forward to exploring more of their fresh menu."}
{"text":"Food is dope. Breakfast or lunch doesn't matter whatever you spend your money on will be phenomenal. Everything is sooo fresh and tasty! I think the spot is locally owned and the owner is amazing.  Great service prompt but relaxed and friendly which is all you can really ask for. Love it!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and great breakfast sandwiches. If this place was in a better location like downtown Chandler it'd be a hit. I suspect it's only a matter of time before it blows up."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients and unique sandwiches.  Love to have a healthy lunch place so close to our house. Can't wait to try their breakfast. Warm, friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"The service at Graz is amazing!  We were greeted immediately when we walked in and the menu was explained to us right away.  Everything was clean and well taken care of.  The food was so fresh and delicious, we will be back!"}
{"text":"FRIENDLY STAFF! first time here & noticed there were some regulars because the guy at the counter recognized some customers, called them by name & knew what they were going to order. love that type of feel! great fresh food! came for breakfast & would definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had the Zeus and my son got the Gooey. Both were sooooo yummy. Would definitely go again. Staff working was also very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Love this place. Highly recommend. Always fresh ingredients. .. Love the staff always friendly as well as the owner"}
{"text":"Stellar service. We each had a sandwich and shared the pesto pasta and a pastry that was sort of like a cronut. It was ALL spectacular. The jalape√±o spread is amazing. I wish I didn't live so far away from this place because I could see myself having lunch here multiple times a week."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been telling me about this great spot that is in my neighborhood that I must try, I would love it. Well, today I did try it and she was right, I do love it! It is a great spot for a week day lunch. Healthy options with great flavor! I had the Special: Athleta Sandwich: 9 grain bread, red onions, cucumber, tomato, hummus red, with a lite sprinkle of wine and vinegar dressing and added Bores Head Turkey. Yummy in my tummy! I also tasted the Citrus Quinoa Salad and Kale they were both delicious and are in the cold case so you can just come in and grab and go The manager, Marcus is also a great reason to visit, very friendly, attention to detail and has taught his team the meaning of customer service. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Fresh food and friendly service. The whole place smells amazing when you walk in. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"GRAZ is definitely the new up n coming #1 sandwich shop in the east valley area. The staff Is awesome and very personable. I wish them nothing but the best, please spread the word around. Lets help GRAZ succeed!"}
{"text":"So I picked up a Groupon and decided to give this place a whirl.  Greeted and served professionally and cheerfully.   Menu has lots of great choices and we ended up getting breakfast sandwiches and ice teas.  Delicious!   We needed more choices for breakfast, and looking forward to trying lunch.  Semper Fi, sir."}
{"text":"Great lunch at Graz today! Had the 'Roast Beast' sandwich and a side of their amazing kale slaw (you've got to try it). The fresh ingredients and friendly staff kept the lunch crowd smiling. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were alright but really small. Quality is hyped up and nothing too fancy to rave about. For $10, I would expect more."}
{"text":"I was actually just passing through and looked it up so I stopped by and it was a little place but the food was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"My little family comes here regularly for breakfast and lunch, about once a week. We love this place!! The juices are delicious, the food is always excellent, and the staff is awesome. We'll be coming here for as long as we can!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch, and were pleasantly surprised. The ciabatta sandwiches we had were unique and very tasty and fresh. They sell Poore Brothers chips in small bags, which are locally made and are the best. The service also was outstanding. The owner was very personable and helpful. The place is in the same shopping center as Walmart."}
{"text":"This is an exciting find. I went here for lunch today and had 1/2 of a BL Cheese sandwich and Kale Slaw. It was the perfect amount of food. Enough to be full but not so much that I ate too much. The sandwich was good - but super buttery and rich. Good but I would have preferred less fats / oils. The Kale slaw was nice and bright.  I will certainly be back for other lunch combinations."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch since I was in the area. I have never been to Graz before but would probably come back if I happened to be in Chandler. 

The customer service was very good! The cashier was extremely nice and my food was made in a very timely manner. I ordered a green goddess grilled cheese which was quite tasty. The bread was nice and buttery crisp. I also ordered a side of kale slaw that was good. While the food did taste great, it was nothing out of the ordinary or something that I could not make at home myself. However I would still recommend Graz for a nice lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is just so much better than other sandwich places there's no comparison they're the best the flying pig sandwich in my opinion is the best"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. We looked at the reviews and figured it was going to be a really good lunch spot. Not the case. I would rather go to Sweet Tomatoes they have all you can eat soup sandwiches pastas salads drinks ice cream fruit for $10 a person instead of $10 for a dried out cold piece of bread in a little bit and meat and lettuce. I would give this place out of 10  a 3."}
{"text":"So Marcus, the owner, saw my wife and I passing by starring into his sandwhich shop and poked his head out the window amd said \"We make a really mean grilled cheese, come on in\". Graz just opened on Monday apparently he tells us as we skimmed over the menu. We decided to take his recommendations, the \"BL cheese\" and the \"flying pig\".
So freaking good. I really digged the BL cheese (hot sandwhich w/ cheddar tomatoes, mixed greens h bacon on sourdough). Tasted nice and fluffy not greasy like I was expecting. 
The Flying pig  was really good too, Havarti cheese was a great touch but not sure how some people would feel about the herb spread. Can be strong for some. Reminded me of a strong honey mustard. 

Overall, definitely coming back. Would like to continue to support local business that has a great product. Come if your interested in a gourmet home cooked sandwhich"}
{"text":"Friendly Fresh Filling. Wish I lived closer, would be my new Favorite. JDB"}
{"text":"Just had our breakfast at Graz! Had the rise n shine sandwich and fresh fruit steel cut oatmeal! Both were delicious! The flavor in the sandwich and the local baked bread was AMAZING! The owner Marcos was welcoming and very attentive! Please support local friends!"}
{"text":"Simple, Fresh, Delicious. I've been so tired of heavy foods slathered in sauce to try and cover the taste of less than fresh food. Graz is the complete opposite. Bright, cheery place, wonderful owners, great food. The Kale Slaw is delicious."}
{"text":"What a quaint and yummy place, Marcus is not only an outstanding citizen and host  but an Armed Services Veteran. ( be sure to thank him for his service ) The food is absolutely amazing , I have had the pleasure of having breakfast and lunch and both have been some of the best I've had.  If you are looking for a feel good and eat good place you have to stop in and meet Marcus and team !!!!!!' You will be hard pressed to find a better place."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Skip jimmy johns and walk across the parking lot for some really good food.  And nice people.  The kale slaw and pesto salad both were fresh, delicious and you can taste the quality.  Sandwich we tried had the perfect medley of flavors.  Kids grilled cheese?  This one is so good the adults will steal it!  The amazing cookie combos will really tempt you.  Try it - you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Amazing service... I mean, these employees made direct eye contact and greeted every single customer. Incredibly friendly, which is rare! It's so hard to find genuine staff these days!  Soda machine was down, but they made up for it with the delicious sandwich. They have the best combinations and options for even the most picky eaters. My food was cooked perfectly and the meat was full of flavor. 200% coming back just to be treated well!"}
{"text":"First of all, they have the nicest staff ever! The food is great too. I've ordered multiple things off of the menu and they've all been delicious."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! Kale slaw is heaven; I can't wait to be in Arizona again just to have that kale slaw. Eating healthy when it tastes great is the best. Go visit Graz!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great people. Do yourself a favor and try it out-you won't be disappointed, I can promise you that."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese I've ever had, don't tell mom. Great customer service. Very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The parking is not very good but that's not Graz's fault. The walk is worth it."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and wonderful food. Stopped in for breakfast for the first time this weekend. Had a Hard Hat sandwich and my wife had the bagel sandwich. Both were fresh, tasty and good portion size. Can't wait to try there grilled cheese sammys for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is very VERY good!  I had The Flying Pig and for a simple sandwich it was top notch. Staff was really nice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and tried 2 of their breakfast sandwiches, the morning glory and the oh bagel where art thou. They were both good but the number one thing that left me disappointed was the amount of meat that were in the sandwiches. I only ordered the ham  both times and there was just like one slice of ham which is less than you get at burger king. It would not bother me so much if it wasn't that the sandwiches were around 8.00. When you are charging that enormous of a high price, it better be of the best quality and be plenty of it. The egg was also too much if they are spending most of their money on that. It was airy, a little bit too airy and fluffy which you felt like you were biting on egg souffle intead of scrambled eggs. I would not go back here for the cost versus quality, not enough quality and too high of a cost. I would tell them to put a little more meat and less egg if you want to charge that price."}
{"text":"We decided to give Graz a try... In general it's good but it's missing that punch. The 4 stars are for the fresh pressed juice, which was amazing. I would probably go back just for the juices. I had the chicken soup and 1/2 of the flying pig. My hubby had the 'Oh bagel where art thou'. Ingredients were fresh and gotta give a thumbs up to the staff--- all super friendly."}
{"text":"My first time in and the service was awesome! The owner greeted us as soon as we walked in. The food and the tea was amazing."}
{"text":"Solid sandwich/salad offerings for breakfast and lunch. GRAZ uses quality ingredients in their dishes and it's very noticeable. If you want a sandwich that is a cut above other options in the area, this is the place to go. They also have excellent customer service--I was taken through the whole menu on my first visit."}
{"text":"Definitely deserving of 5 stars.  Not the greatest location in the world but worth finding!  We tried the 'beast' and the 'zeus' sandwiches which were absolutely excellent...different than your usual sandwich shop fare...these sandwiches had gourmet flavor profiles.  We will do everything we can to help this independent business make it and encourage everyone out there to give GRAZ (for GREEN ARIZONA) a try.  Marcus, the owner, will be there to greet you and assist you if you need a suggestion or two.  He steered us to these two wonderful sandwiches, for which we are very grateful."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! Non of the breads or wraps are vegan, so if you need a vegan substitute ask for the sandwich wrapped in romain. Athena was so delicious, add avocado for extra flare! Other than the great food, the staff is extremely helpful and genuinely nice. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had seen the banner on Pecos rd for a while now on our way to 24hr fitness. We finally stopped in after a tough cardio day and we're pleased to find a local owned establishment offering healthy options. I have never had kale before but decided to try the chopped salad and slaw. They had a delicious crunch with light housemade vinaigrette dressings, and the portions were generous. They also have breakfast which I'm exited to try. It's nice to have a fresh and healthy alternative to corporate chains."}
{"text":"Excellent small sandwich shop! Great food and atmosphere. It's is small inside, only about 6 tables, but worth the wait for the food. They also serve breakfast sandwiches that sound amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is closing today (May 31) for about a week.  According to the guy at the cash register when they reopen they won't sell sandwiches anymore but just juices and prepared meals intended for take home."}
{"text":"Delicious! Beyond delicious! I had the Green Goddess and can't wait to try everything else.. although it will be hard to pass on the Green Goddess.Help support this local restaurant - anything else would be a sin."}
{"text":"Holy COW this is the BEST breakfast sandwich in AZ. Definitely try the Where art thou beagle, with either turkey or bacon... maybe switch out the beagle with sourdough and swap the regular cream cheese with their jalapeno cream cheese?? OH man it is GOOD.  I go here at least twice a week now. The juice is also AMAZING, the one with the almond milk, and the other one with carrot and ginger.... perfecto."}
{"text":"If you are craving a crispy, buttery, delicious, elevated grilled cheese- this is where to go!

The owner, or whoever it was that helped us was so so nice and friendly! The inside was very clean, and really nice. 

Here is what we ordered: 

The B.L. Grilled Cheese - 8.50
Vermont white cheddar, tomatoes, mixed greens & bacon on Sour Dough.

The Flying Pig - 8.50
Turkey breast, bacon, roasted tomatoes, lettuce, herb spread & havarti cheese on country white.

The BL was so ridiculously delicious- wow it was a serious work of art. I have never seen a grilled sandwich like it- i ran my fork across the top and it was completely crisp and buttery- everything worked so well and bacon on it- yes please! Wow, seriously heaven. I wanted ten more lol.

My husband is a little more traditional and can't resist turkey, bacon, or havarti so obviously the Flying Pig sandwich was perfect. I had a bite and it was delcious but a standard sandwich to me- my husband though was in heaven over it haha.

He added the drink/chips combo. I added a drink and grabbed some pesto pasta salad from their cold case. The pasta salad had good flavor, but not sure when it was made as the noodles were pretty tough. As we were leaving my husband grabbed a rice pudding to go- the flavor was so good but the rice was completely undercooked, making it pretty inedible. Sadly we didn't try it until we got home otherwise I am sure they would have refunded our money. 

Overall, we left very satisfied, not super filling, but super super delicious. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We were able to catch breakfast at GRAZ before heading back home from our vacation in AZ. Wow! The breakfast sandwiches were phenomenal, the pastries were so moist and sweet, and the service was second to none. We were delighted to be served by the owner and were concerned that we hadn't seen anyone else to come in to dine while we were there. I'm so glad to see so many positive reviews and happy customers, because this place is just beyond excellent!"}
{"text":"I am on the road all day and sometimes absolutely starving when lunchtime rolls around. I was in the vicinity of Graz. Such super friendly staff. Marcus asked me what I was in the mood for..I said salad in a sandwich. He described The Athena to me. Yum. SOLD!  He made a PERFECT sandwich! Bread was so fresh. Humus was really good. Side piece of watermelon and a Greek olive stopper. They sell my favorite Pelligrino waters too. Nice little local joint!"}
{"text":"Me and my coworker just discovered this place and have already gone twice this week. The food is so delicious and it just makes me happy to see more and more places opening up that have your health in mind. The owner is amazingly sweet and knows how to greet a customer when you come in. Thank you for your amazing food Graz you have a new loyal customer here! :)"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else asking, \"Why does this place have such high reviews?\" 

-Food isn't as fresh as you'd hope.
-Portions could be larger.
-Food takes longer to come out than ideal.
-Prices are higher than I would charge. Avg. price per sandwich should be $5-$7 compared to $7-$9.
-They're not 100% accurate on your order, 100% of time time.
-New employees being trained every time we're in. High turnover = unhappy employees.
-They're failing to execute what their brand image portrays.

Two highlights:
-The owner is a cool guy.
-It's better than it's disgusting neighbor, Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Newest gem in Chandler. Found them through Groupon, great deal. Newly opened, best grilled cheese Sammies, so fresh (thus the name) They use Boar Head products, the best. Owner wonderful. Will definitely go back for breakfast and or juice drinks. Like the other reviewers have said, this place is a home run!"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out with the family.   Located in the old Quiznos place on McQueen and Pecos. This is definitely a better option than Quiznos. We were greeted and we were walked through the menu. Friendly staff that checked on you after you receive your food. Family of four and we fit perfect around the table. Small location but I think it's perfect. We are enjoying the local businesses popping up. We got the flying pig and the earl formerly the bird (no tomato). The only reason we gave 4 stars due to no option for for fresh brewed tea other than bottled and no option for those that do not want bread for sandwich other than salads. They do offer breakfast and would stop in if they offered hot tea or cappuccinos. Overall, it's a great option to the usual chain lunch spot."}
{"text":"Smoothie was different but good.  They have a whole side of the menu dedicated to Grilled Cheeze.  What else can you ask for."}
{"text":"No longer serving cooked to order food and not keeping the hours posted. Apparently this isn't new but Yelp isn't addressing the reports that it is closed. Classic Yelp, wasting my time with their half assed upkeep."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOVE this place!!!! The sandwiches are so good and the service is great. My favorite Sandwich is the Morning Harvest.  The hint of sweet honey with the cheese and egg is so amazing. This isn't a place you just try out once, you will get hooked and literally want to eat the same sandwich every day!"}
{"text":"I had 15 minutes for lunch and wanted something quick and healthy. I was greeted by the friendly owner and all her staff as I walked in. She was so helpful in explaining the menu to me.

I decided on the 1/2 BLT sandwich and 1/2 Caesar salad which was only $7.99. Service was so fast and the food was delicious! As simple as the menu items sound, the ingredients were of high and fresh quality. I will definitely be back for another quick bite!"}
{"text":"Not my kinda place. 

Was in the area on my lunch break and needed some where quick to grab a sandwich.  Quick is not what I got. 

1) It's hard to find. It's in some sort of new concept shopping/salon/mall place. The concept was unfamiliar to me as it is clearly geared to women. There are signs when you are getting close, but nothing when you get there. I had to call to find out where it was. 

2) It took way too long to get my food. I ordered the Roast Beast which is a pretty basic sandwich. At the 15 minute mark, I inquired about the status. I was told that my name hasn't been called yet. No sh1t!  That's why I'm asking how much longer it will take. People who ordered after me had gotten their food ahead of me. 

3) Sandwich was boring. So after 20 minutes I was given my sandwich (to go, even though I said I was eating there). Couldn't image what took so long based on what I got. It was bland with very little roast beef on it. They also managed to invent a new type of ciabatta roll that disintegrates in your hands while eating.  

If you're not already there for some beauty need, don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"I saw Graz across my Yelp feed a few times with great reviews then found a Groupon. It's tucked in a little strip right by GameStop, (kinda hard to see from the road). The owner Marcus and employee Anthony were really nice. I enjoyed our conversation while they were putting together our order; which consisted of the Italian, the BL cheese, a salad and a children's chicken quesadilla. Everything was super fresh and tasted good, but nothing that made us say \"WOW!\" Also without the Groupon, it would've been a bit pricy for what we got. Still...I'd come back again...mostly because I prefer supporting friendly local businesses such as this place."}
{"text":"I was going to Jimmy Johns across the way which I go to like 3x a week and I always see this place. I thought you know what? I am going to finally try this place! The Sandwich was amazing! I got the Green Goddess and I added Turkey! It's a very fancy grilled cheese! I love fancy grilled cheese! The people there were SUPER friendly! The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were a little pricey... But it's still definitely worth trying, and I will bring my friends and family to try! I love the menu and am excited to try more"}
{"text":"Sandwiches don't come flying out of the kitchen - be patient - it's worth the wait. Everything is prepared fresh and the sandwiches are stacked with meat, cheeses and veggies.  The family service is great too. 

I liked the Mr English sandwich. Unique combo of flavors on a perfectly toasted piece of sourdough. I'll be back to try more sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in and got a few sandwiches to go, great food! Very friendly staff as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for a quick lunch or breakfast! Nice healthy options! I had the Zeus on fire and quinoa salad which were both great and fresh. There was a nice citrus/vinegar bite that I enjoyed. The bread was nice and crunchy but not greasy. They had a good fresh brewed black tea, wouldn't have minded another flavor option. Then again I'm addicted to ice tea! My little guy had the kids grilled cheese and kept saying Mmmmmm! Fruit cup had strawberries, blackberries and watermelon. It was nice to see the kids plate had just as much effort put into it as the regular dishes.  

Food was good and I felt great being able to support another local establishment. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to have discovered this hidden gem!  Serving freshly made lunch and breakfast items, this friendly, owner operated/on staff establishment rates a five star on my score card.  In fact, every staff member was peppy and courteous!  The Green Goddess grilled cheese I ordered  was delicious with its spinach, avocado, herb spread and mozzarella.  The kale slaw with green onions, napa cabbage, feta cheese was also fresh and tasty.  I will be visiting Graz kitchen fresh again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Romaine boats. Very disappointing. Small portion for the big price, which ended up not mattering because I threw most of it right in the garbage. The raspberry vinigerette tasted \"fishy\". This was also the opinion 2 of my coworkers who ordered the same thing. The meat was chopped into small cubes. Very slimy texture and a funny taste. I'm guessing it was processed turkey?? Hard to tell. Small bits of finely chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, a bunch of croutons,  and a few bites of bacon rounded out a really awful tasting lunch. I wanted to like, but that didn't happen. When I mentioned this place to my husband he said,\" oh ya I went there with coworkers a few weeks ago and we will not be going back.\""}
{"text":"I was looking something quick and fresh while on my way to bowling and luckily I found Graz. Boar's head meets, fresh made everything. Very high quality all the way around. Great spot.

The manager (I think she's the manager anyways) was very friendly. I've been back a few times now and each time has been excellent. It's on the way to my bowling league, but other than that it's out of the way. I still try to find a reason to swing by, passing dozens of lesser sandwich places on the way. 

Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum yum Incredible every time I make it in, which coming from New River is not often enough. Way better than I was expecting for a breakfast & lunch place when I first happened in. Everything is fresh and several notches above the usual offerings.  Cost a bit more but considering the quality ingredients & professional preparation a very good value."}
{"text":"First visit review:
Yummy! I have had this bookmarked for a while and finally ate here!! Yay! Choices of breakfast items, hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads and soups, Peixoto (local coffee) and pressed drinks from the chalkboard menu. 

GRAZ Grilled Cheese: 
- Green Goddess: ooey-gooey mozzarella cheese. Ripe avocado. Pesto. Fresh Spinach. An herb spread. All between a couple 9 grain buttered and grilled bread poked with a sandwich toothpick so that every bite gets a toasty crunch to it. With a pickle on the side. $8.35.

Paired with soup 
- tomato bisque: chunky tomatoes. Turkey sausage andouille (I think). Cannoli beans. Kidney beans. And probably some other goods. A side of croutons. Very hearty filled wintery soup that I wouldn't mind eating by itself.  $3.25 if paired with a half or whole sandwich. 

All in all I enjoyed the meal as I was overly content and wishing my stomach could try the pressed juices and take a coffee to go. :) would love to try the other items. 

Owners/staff were great and helpful! Seating capacity looked to be about 15 count or so. Stool seats. A couple outside tables. 

Open Monday-Friday 7am-6pm
Saturday 7am-3pm. 
Sunday closed. Would be nice to have Sundays open but everyone deserves a day off! :)"}
{"text":"Fresh breakfast and lunch sandwiches, croissants, cinnamon buns, steele cut oatmeal, salads, custom blended coffee and fresh pressed veggie and fruit juices! After four visits food is consistently high quality (plus being delicious), service is excellent and it has friendly, relaxing atmosphere. Love the \"Fly me to the Moon\" with turkey, white cheddar, scrambled egg on a fresh Brioche bun. Yum! Everything is made locally and so fresh!"}
{"text":"First time here...I will be back!  I felt very welcomed when I walked in the door. They did an overview of their menu and I took them up on their recommendation of the Zues on Fire. It was a large sandwich with tons of flavor."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was nothing to rave about. BLT barely had bacon and was very bland. The Zues was on the lean side for meat as well.  $24 for two sandwiches and an iced tea is a bit high. I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch her and loved the sandwiches and cinnamon roll!  Everyone was friendly and it looked clean.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The owner was super cool and walked us through their awesome menu.  The sandwiches were delish! Looking forward to going back again for more! Thank you for being an awesome local restaurant right in my neighborhood. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches.. Super tasty and very clean and fresh ingredients . Prices are low to decent cost .
The place is also neat and nice."}
{"text":"Pickelgate happened here. This establishment is apparently too cheap to include a pickle on to-go orders. Originally, I ordered the bird sandwich to go, but after it was in the bag, I changed my mind and my co-worker ordered and we dined inside. I noticed his sandwich had a pickle and when I asked about my lack of one, that is when the female cashier said no pickles for to-go orders. Yes, the pickle nazi's.

   My toasted sandwich came out looking like a 5 year-old made my lunch. Toasted usually means the whole thing, not just the bread. The sandwich itself had way more green leafy lettuce than turkey and the homemade sauce could not be tasted. Besides that, most of these  items are jacked up three bucks more than they should cost. I only wandered in here because the line at Jimmy John's was too long, but turns out it was a mistake. 

also, can anybody else in America make a sandwich besides clueless teenagers?"}
{"text":"Cool little concept inside what seems to be a Co-working place for hair stylists. Lots of younger clientele. Neat little coffee shop next door. 
Everything homemade to order. 
Healthy options with their drinks- you can add protein, for example. 

Cool decor. Love unique concepts like this!!!"}
{"text":"Super bomb. The girl at the front was really sweet and helped me out since it was my first time. Ended up with 2 morning glory's and one ultimate Breakfast Mack. Bomb! Fresh made juice as well with the Grove; pineapple, orange and banana. Yum-o! Definitely recommend. 

FIND THEM ON GROUPON!"}
{"text":"Yes, you'll pay a bit more than the nearby chain sandwich shops. But the upside is that the food here is high quality and tasty.  Service was friendly, and we had a nice conversation with the owner on one of the two occasions that we were here. Good sandwiches. Good people. Clean. High quality. Good value."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here and had the romaine boats salad.  I got extra chicken on them and the potions of chicken, feta, and veggies created a nice taste blend without one ingredient overwhelming the other.  The citrus vinaigrette dressing had a wonderful flavor. Every thing was fresh made and healthy.  The staff was friendly and offered to try to customize anything you wanted (I did ask for no croutons and a different dressing).  You can tell they take pride in what they are offering their customers, it is not just a job to them.  I definitely will be back when I am in this area."}
{"text":"BLT on 9 grain is amazing!! I forget about this place because it's hidden, thankfully I live and work close.  Great food!! A must go, even if you only have 30 mins for lunch!"}
{"text":"Hidden Healthy Delicious Gem!  

I met with a client in the area and was craving something delicious and healthy.  These great ratings and reviews are no coincidence!  

My Order:

*Zeus on Fire (add hummus and roasted tomatoes)  
*Green Machine Fresh Juice

Truly one of the BEST sandwiches I have ever tasted.  I will definitely be coming back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here and the sandwiches are outstanding! What I like the best is they use ingredients that are fresh but also diffent than what you get at most sandwich places. I have had Zeus on Fire and Mr English sandwich both are excellent,  Mr English is good if you like a little heat. Highly recommend this place, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have Graz near my neighborhood! The owner Marcus seems like a great guy and definitely loves his restaurant. I came here for the first time about a week ago and loved it, so I came back again today and was greeted by my first name! I was so surprised and impressed by his memory and that he made an effort to remember my name. Graz is a great example of an awesome local, family owned restaurant. 

Of course, the food is excellent and the juices are so refreshing. I recommend the flying pig!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had a coupon for a free breakfast sandwich and it was the best sandwich! I also got the \"garbage cookie and omg it was so tasty! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is it a great local spot, the owner is so nice and the food is fabulous! Their grilled sandwiches are so good.  I had their chop salad today and was so impressed. The friend I was with didn't get basil on her sandwich, when she mentioned it they quickly fixed it.  The owner then came over and dropped off a delicious pastry thing that he makes in house every morning.  Will definitely be going on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Graz is my favorite Chandler breakfast/lunch spot - it has the most delicious food (their quinoa salad and Green Goddess are my favorite!) and the best customer service!  Marcus, the owner, and his staff are always friendly and make a point to remember their customers and even what they order.  They have inside and patio seating and they do to-go orders.  There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about my dozens of experiences at Graz.  They are THE best."}
{"text":"Got juices for my son and myself. Very yummy. Service was awesome and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the best. So fresh and so fast. Everyone that works there is amazing as well. I get the Green Goddess every time and I'd highly recommend it. If you're looking for healthy food at a great price this is the best place to go."}
{"text":"Great staff always welcoming and willing to help. Good food. Nice place to have a meal."}
{"text":"Some places deserve more than 5 stars and this is one of them.  A few months ago I stopped in and tried the Hard Hat breakfast sandwich ($8.00).  With eggs, roast beef, sharp cheddar, onion, & a jalapeno spread, this is a perfect sandwich.  Great flavor combinations!  I have since been back and brought my husband along to have this sandwich a few more times.  For me, it was difficult to order anything else because I enjoyed this one so much.  With a bounty juice drink, I felt like I had a great breakfast.  

I still wanted to return either for lunch or dinner sometime and try a couple of the grilled cheeses, which sounded amazing as well.  Earlier this week we finally made it and tried the Appiccicoso (Gooey) and the Rusty Pig, both $8.50.  The Gooey has mozzarella, pesto, pepperoni, salami, capicola, & roasted tomatoes on ciabatta, and the Rusty Pig has mozzarella, balsamic vinaigrette, roasted tomatoes, fresh basil, and applewood smoked bacon on sourdough bread.  

For both the flavors were so fresh and delicious.  I can tell quality is the priority here, and I also liked the fact that the bread is thin and doesn't overwhelm the sandwich.  The ingredients really shine.  We also tried a cookie that was fantastic and now every time I go in I look for another one.  

The service is friendly and fast, and they have several options to pick up your order.  You can come in of course, or call and pick it up, and they will even take it to you in your car out front.  Just call ahead.  We also visited with the owner about potential catering orders.  They do it all.    Fantastic place!  Best grilled cheeses I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Graz Kitchen Fresh is a hidden little gem south of the Chandler Mall in a modern setup of local businesses within one space. The breakfast burrito may just have the usual ingredients but is pretty heavenly in reality - the salsa is what pushes it over the edge. Add in the fact that the space is a big with a lot of room to make your own space. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding !  I had the Athena sandwich and my friend had the LO salad. The pesto dressing was amazing and different from any pesto I've had in the past. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"It's always nice to see new local businesses open in Chandler (way too many chain restaurants). I've come here for breakfast a couple times now. I really like the hospitality of the staff and the food is both simple and made from scratch. I enjoyed the reading the owner's bio (Marcus) on their website and how he came to open this place. He has a passion to cook and to share his food with the surrounding community. I've had both the Oh Bagel Where Art Thou breakfast sandwich and one of their juices. Both were delicious and fresh. GRAZ also supports other local business here in Chandler by serving Peixoto coffee (a local coffee shop down the street). The Chandler food community is finally coming along!"}
{"text":"I have been to this spot several times. Each visit has been excellent! The people working are friendly and polite. The food is always fresh and delicious. One of the best places in Chandler for lunch (haven't tried breakfast here yet). Definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious!!! And amazing customer service!!  If I could give them ten stars i would! We just moved out here from California and it's been very hard to find delicious and satisfying fresh food. We are going to be coming here forever.... there menu list many fresh ingredients and everything is made fresh to order like there \"green machine\" that was freshly juiced. I built my own breakfast burrito and wow was it delicious! And the salsa that it comes with was the bomb! My husband and my son both grabbed sandwiches and ate them all. Over all I was extremely satisfied and can't wait to come again! Love Graz"}
{"text":"If you want tasty, healthy, filling food & fast, friendly service at a good price (who doesn't), come to GRAZ!! The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful, and the food is incredible. The girl behind the counter greeted us and walked us newbies through the menu, and the guy making the food was very accommodating, helping us choose & modify to our liking. We got the Zeus on Fire & the Pig-something grilled cheeses.. They were delicious while still being healthy, light & filling. The pressed juice was yummy too."}
{"text":"Love love love their fresh juice blends. The breakfast sandwiches are good too. Need to come back to try their oatmeal or salads.

Service is always friendly to boot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and the service matches. I've been here a few times for breakfast and lunch.. I liked the romaine boats and 'the pig' sandwich the most... The quinoa side is one of my favorites also. Team is always really friendly, love supporting small businesses like this one :)"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant last year and again today while traveling from California. What a gem! The food is high quality (they use Boars Head meats!)and fresh and the menu is creative.

Both times, we've been greeted by the owner who is extremely accommodating. They have fresh squeezed juices and also offer healthier alternatives to everyday delicious items. 

Each time we've been I got a Gourmet Grilled Cheese. They offer various types with different styles and meats etc. the bread is to die for! I think it's sourdough and a thick cut, and it really helps make the sandwich amazing!

My husband has gotten some of their regular sandwiches and they were delicious! A good balance of all ingredients!

A must have item is the Kale Slaw. It's a sort of cole slaw but made with Kale and it was SO good. My hubby normally likes meat and potatoes type foods and he loves the kale slaw! I also liked the quinoa salad!

Everything was made very fresh and the service was quick. The first time we visited we were starving from traveling awhile and we were NOT disappointed. And this trip back we knew where to go for a good meal. 

I'm so happy to see so many great reviews, as we too love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent owner and staff in addition to great food! We ordered a pressed juice and it was a perfect blend of orange, carrot, ginger, and banana. The owner, Marcus, also gave us samples of some of the side dishes that he had available - you guys, so good! I especially liked the kale salad side. It was flavorful with a citrusy dressing and just the right amount of texture and crunch. The walnut pesto pasta salad was also great, but I prefer the crunchy texture of the kale. We also got \"the gooey\" sandwich, which is essentially an Italian styled pressed sandwich - super flavorful and loaded up with lots of salami, mozzarella and pesto. Finally, we couldn't leave without having one of the fresh pastries. Some pastries are made in-house and some are brought in from local bakeries in town. The cinnamon roll was pretty epic! 

I'm just ecstatic that we've found such a great little local shop just around the corner from our house. I also love that Graz supports the other local businesses in town by offering their products at the shop (I.e. the pastries from local bakeries and also coffee from Peixoto *swoon*). So many of my favorite local places rolled up into one!

Will be back certainly for the pastries, absolutely for the food and juices, but most especially for the great service and people who run the shop."}
{"text":"The food tastes incredible! Filled with flavor and nutritious ingredients. I got the Notorius P.I.G. It was like nothing I've ever eaten before. There is a splash of honey which compliments the strong salami in way you wouldn't imagine possible. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. The price is a little steep for the sandwiches. I would make it a wrap instead of the sandwich."}
{"text":"The most amazing sandwiches and fresh juices ! 
I was there with my son for a lunch and they were able to make vegetarian sandwich for us ! The staff was really nice , food was great and place was very clean. I will come here again !"}
{"text":"I am amazed this place has such good reviews! We had a terrible experience long wait time. They got our order wrong & the food was not even good. So upset waste of a morning!"}
{"text":"If you haven't discovered this little gem in chandler you're missing out. GREAT sandwiches, personable and friendly staff and local ingredients and coffee. I recommend any of their many grilled cheeses or the \"my Italian\". But really I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Was suggested this place while waiting for T-Mobile to finish porting all of our devices and I was not disappointed! No boring submarine sammiches here. We ordered the BLT and the Flying PIG and both were delicious! Toasted sourdough bread and crispy bacon. The BLT had fresh romaine and not crappy iceberg lettuce. I was hesitant on trying the sauce on the flying pig (a creamy goat cheese and pesto sauce) but the owner let me try a sample and it was fantastic! Definitely would go again soon! For those complaining about the price, they're a local farm to table business. If you want a big cheap sandwich that the meat is questionable this isn't the place for you"}
{"text":"Fantastic food made with high quality ingredients. Coffee (hot and iced), and smoothies were also great.

Dining area was clean, as were the restrooms. Staff was outstanding. A little on the pricey side for breakfast."}
{"text":"In Chandler for a kids football game and wanted something quick but not fast food. Found on Yelp and the reviews don't lie.  Amazing variety and very yummy sandwiches.  The owner was super nice and helpful with making suggestions.  Lots of veggie options!  Had the Athena it was delicious and my hubby had the Zues and really enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"First time going and the sandwich was great! I got the \"gooey\". It was very fresh and better than I expected. The owner was very nice. I definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are awesome! First time we came, we both had our own sandwiches and couldn't finish them. At $8 a sandwich we decided to split one for breakfast. We had the Rise & Shine and boy did it have flavor. Lots of egg in the sandwich and they split the sandwich into two trays and gave us each a piece of cantaloupe.  Very friendly staff and a coffee-shop style dining area with seats outside. We'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Extremely pleasant experience at this place from the moment I walked in the door until the moment I shook what seemed to be the owner's hand on my exit. I got the Zeus on Fire grilled cheese. I was given an extra snickerdoodle type side thing on the house which was really good as well. The sandwich was absolutely outstanding, fully recommend it. They offer fresh juices made from scratch the moment you order it, no pre-puree'd mix or bottled juices, just fresh fruits and vegetables.

If you want food with fresh ingredients and a phenomenal staff to boot, try this place out. Only thing is the hours, close at 5-6 pm and closed Sundays, won't be getting dinner at this place. Fortunately for me I was on a lunch break so I could stop through :)"}
{"text":"Great service, bagel sandwich and the mornin glory sand which were both delicious. Bread was fresh and soft! Eggs were fluffy and fresh made. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food,WONDERFUL staff!! Who knew Kaleslaw could be so DELICIOUS!! Mmm I'll be back again.  I haven't tried everything... I will though. :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Easy and simple breakfast.  Grilled Cheese lovers dream!  Must try local place."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!  Chili was awesome. Flying Pig was gooey and scrumptious. Wife has the BL and loved it!!!!  Staff was polite, inviting and very informative.  Can't wait for next weekend when we go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches! If you want the best grilled cheese ever this is the place for you! But the lettuce boats are what I come in for! Deliciousness without the carbs! The owner is so courteous and welcoming! If it's your first time in he will help you choose something you will love from their menu."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh food, and a nice owner. My husband got the Appiccicoso (with some BOMB pesto) and I got the special- a fresh Greek sandwhich called the 'Zeus on Fire'. I'm excited for this local business!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place written up in the local paper - was nearby and stopped in.  Boy am I glad I did!  Great customer service.  Owner went over the menu with me.  After a tough week at work, an amazing grilled cheese sandwich was perfect - simple, great ingredients and made with passion.  As the owner said \"go simple first time in a new spot....if they can do that with perfection.....you will be back\".  They nailed it!  Location is in a tight parking lot but they offer curbside service (be sure to pick up a menu to call in an order).  Cant wait to try breakfast and the more \"sophisticated\" items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a good and affordable place to get juices. The juice was tiny and was $9!!! I could finish it before I got to my car. It was good but I felt ripped off. Very friendly staff, I would try their food, it looked good and they use Boar's Head."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been coming here for a couple years now since they first opened.  I have never had a bad sandwich, and I've sure tried a lot! Their breakfast is amazing and their lunch is awesome! Everyone is always super friendly, and Marcus, the owner is always so personable! There are many different sandwich places out there but this is my absolute favorite! Everything is always so fresh and delicious! :)"}
{"text":"Very Good!!  The menu is unique but not crazy.  All sandwiches & some salads.  We got the Rise & Shine, Zeus in Fire and the Green Green Goddess... all awesome!  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I never eat my entire meal, but it was so good I did at Graz. Absolutely delicious and quality, healthy deli cuisine. Amazing menu with unique combinations and generous portions. I had the Green Goddess as a wrap (can't eat bread) and I couldn't get over how tasty the in house homemade walnut pesto was (coming from a gal who makes her own mac nut and traditional pesto). Hubby had the Zeus on Fire and gave it a ten. The kale slaw was deliciously refreshing and not loaded down with sugar, just the right amount of sweetness using honey.  Super clean and cool atmosphere. Owner so friendly you felt like you were a guest in his home. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  Tucked away in a shopping center, GRAZ is a sure-to-be-back establishment.  The greeting, ordering, meeting the owner, food, cleanliness and ambiance was superb!  Did I mention the FOOD?  Fresh, plentiful and unique.  Please patronize this local eatery.  You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I got to say, this place doesn't need my review, there are 187 already! But I want to compliment them on their wonderful customer service from the time you walk in, to checking to make sure you're enjoying the meal. Fresh, helpful, healthy and delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am sure they make something else st Graz besides the rise & shine breakfast sandwich. I mean, I see there are other things written on the board, but I have yet to get past this sandwich because it's phenomenal. I am not Big on breakfast out, it's usually not very inventive and nothing I can't make at home, but Graz disproves that theory. The bread is amazingly hearty and flavorful and the pesto on the sandwich  just gives it a huge kick of flavor and the eggs are fluffy and brighter yellow than anything you've ever seen at home."}
{"text":"I got the blue sandwich it wasn't bad nothing to brag about. The juice is chunky iv never ever gotten juice where it is chunky!! They even ran it through their machine again and it was still a chunky texture I think they need a better juicer LOL."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident today. My daughter has food allergies so I wanted to see how they could accommodate her. Met the owner and he was extremely nice and helpful. Brought my daughter back this evening and we give it 4 thumbs up. Fresh ingredients blended in a thoughtful fashion to make wonderful sandwiches. Will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Really great local salad/sandwich deli. The owner is great and always available for a chat. They walked me through the entire menu. Wifi was available, and I was able to meet a colleague there for lunch and get work done. Please visit and keep this local place in business!"}
{"text":"I ate here awhile back a few times, plus I used them for a catering job and the food was great. Service and food both were great."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times since discovering it, and it's a great lunch spot with friendly service. I highly recommend you try this local business!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh and I'm obsessed. I love the rise and shine. Pressed grain with eggs, pesto, spinach, etc.
I'm thankful they aren't working walking distance, I would live there!!
They are so friendly, owner is always there and he truly cares!"}
{"text":"Customer service was absolutely terrific. The guy that I presume is the owner was very friendly, courteous and attentive. I ordered the Flying Pig. Very tasty, fresh and light. The bread was fresh and the cheese was too. The turkey they use was very tasty and so was the bacon. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"I had the Q-power salad and the kale slaw. I highly recommend the Q-power salad. It was so good! Too bad I didn't take their recommendation to order a larger size. I wish I had more of it and skipped the kale slaw. The slaw wasn't bad, but the Q-power salad is what will keep me coming back. I am happy to have more healthy, fresh and quick food options coming to the East Valley! And the person that helped me so friendly and gave great suggestions on helping me order."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Phoenix area and found this cool little place for lunch.  A lot of interesting sandwiches including grilled cheeses."}
{"text":"The sandwiches my mom and I purchased from Graz were very fresh and delicious! However, on the menu it does not state that the \"herb spread\" contains the walnut pesto. My mom purchased the Flying Pig sandwich and let me try some of it. The sandwich was very yummy but after a few bites I started getting an allergic reaction because I am allergic to walnuts. We spoke to the employee owner about this and how we think they should update their menu to inform customers who might have this same allergy, but they did not seem to concerned with our comments. Overall, the food was very good, just know that some of their food may be made with walnuts and not stated on the menu. My allergic reaction was not very serious, but this is a pretty common allergy and I do not want anyone else to have to go through what I did."}
{"text":"An amazing place for breakfast and lunch.  They use all natural products.  I loved the Cibatta bread!.  The owner and staff are so kind.  They have fresh juices too.  I will be back!  So much better than Subway or Paradise."}
{"text":"So glad to have discovered this little gem on Yelp today. Had the Green Goddess with havarti rather than mozzarella and it was near perfect (minus the unripe avocado). The kale slaw is exceptional and the friendly owner and staff are nothing but a pleasure. The only thing I am upset about is that I didn't discover them sooner! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients. All the grilled cheese sandwiches I've had here are top notch. Service is also really friendly. Support a cool local place!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with what great owners here. Very nice and personable while genuinely caring about what they put out for food. Fresh, organic, amazing food."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a good price. The owner is very personable an makes sure you have everything you need. The coffee is also delicious and the smoothies are a must try.   The shop is tucked away in the corner of a small strip mall but is easily located by its Boars Head umbrellas out front."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and love their food! I would highly recommend for a breakfast/lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to grab a quick bite to eat. I ordered the Rusty Pig based on recommendations. It was quite possibly the most delicious \"panini\" type sandwich I've ever had. The cheese was perfectly melted and the applewood smoked bacon was flavorful. It didn't taste too oily either (which some panini sandwiches normally suffer from at other places I've been). As an additional treat while my friend and I were chatting one of the employees came over to offer us a sample of their special mac and cheese that they had prepared for the Super Bowl weekend. It smokey and delicious as well. Great food combined with awesome service really made this experience awesome in my book.

If you're looking for delicious food, drop by GRAZ Kitchen Fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh and delicious. I've had almost everything on the menu and it is ALL good. If you ever see a soup on the menu, try it. There soups are made fresh and are so gooood! 
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Saw this business on veteranownedbusiness.com
I'm always going to support my fellow Veterans before any chain restaurant. Marcus and staff were friendly from the moment I walked in the door. Being a Vegetarian, Marcus recommended the Morning Glory. Nine grain bread, Havarti Cheese and Scrambled Eggs make a very filing sandwich. I'm not a big juicer, but tried one of out curiosity  (I can't remember the name right now). Anyway,  the place is Veteran Owned, local and has great food. I'm now a regular customer."}
{"text":"I'm a member of the Junior League of Phoenix, and Marcus (the owner) very kindly hosted a meeting for us at Graz earlier this week where he shared some of his experiences opening his own business. He also shared some food samples, and I was impressed enough to bring my husband back today to meet for a lunch date.

I had the Green Goddess grilled cheese (with house-made walnut pesto) and my husband had the B.L. Cheese. They were both delicious, with fresh high-quality ingredients, and not greasy at all. We also shared a side of the kale slaw and both left full (I even took half my sandwich home!) I asked Marcus to tell my husband about their special Saturday cinnamon bun (made using croissant dough) and he happened to have one for us to try. It was every bit as wonderful as his description made it sound.

We will be back for sure. This is such a cool locally-owned business that I hope people are able to discover!"}
{"text":"I came here at the persuassion of my coworker, she got a Groupon. I LOVED it, we did our research before hand, and it was great to support a local business. The 'Flying Pig' Sandwhich was superb. The apple smoked bacon was just the right thickness, and complimented the thinly sliced turkey breast. Roasted tomatoes contrasted well with the herb spread. All on a toasted slice of bread. It was such a great treat to have such a finely crafted, delicious sandwhich. I represent 4 hotel properties in the area, and definitely will be putting this on our Preferred Catering, and Restaurant List. Thank you for the great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I found this place via Yelp cuz it was close to the office. I was running late for a meeting and I guess it showed when I got to the front counter. The gentleman was great. Suggested a Zeus sandwich and I was in and out in under 10 mins. Great service and great food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious without the guilt! Tucked away in a plaza off of Arizona Ave and Pecos this place is like a hidden gem! With a cute modern atmosphere, food that  is ridiculously fresh, a juice bar and the people are extremely friendly! I had the kale coleslaw which was something I couldn't have even dreamt up it was so good and my sandwich was so fresh and well put together from the sun dried tomatoes to the pesto to the cheese I could taste everything in one bite! Fresh, delicious and healthy we will be coming back !"}
{"text":"Small restaurant - Order at the counter and eat in or at the patio or to go.  Not a HUGE selection of sandwiches or salads, but good fresh ingredients.  They had breakfast sandwiches/burritos served all day and a list of different types of grilled cheese sandwiches.  Had a smoothie & salad, hubby had a sandwich and tea.  Salad was unexpectedly very good, dressing was super flavorful.  It was the last one on the list with mixed greens, avocado and mozzarella with a goat cheese/pesto dressing.  Dressing was just the right amount - not too heavy.  Hubby's sandwich was fresh and looked as if made in our own kitchen.  Baked goods looked delicious but watching my diet so couldn't try them.  The best looking one was a roll made of croissant dough, rolled in cinnamon sugar with orange zest.  Can't wait to try those one day!  Friendly and helpful staff.  Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Such a charming place! The customer service was amazing and the person that helped us was incredibly knowledgeable.

We had a few veggie sandwiches and kids grilled cheese sandwiches that were really good.

Unfortunately, we are a family that loves juicing. We had two of their green juices that weren't \"juice\".. they were more of a cross between a smoothie and a juice \"pop\".. way too much ice and there shouldn't be a lot of pulp in a juice. When you pay that much for a juice \"meal\".. it should be good."}
{"text":"Really good food. I had a breakfast sandwich, my bf had a lunch sandwich. Bread was local, nice and fresh, everything tasted amazing. We had got the Groupon, which is why we came here, but we will be back for sure. Really great customer service too."}
{"text":"The owner is always so friendly and remembers me by name! His food is phenomenal and my husbands a chef so I'm a bit of a food snob. It's fresh and the flavor are always on point! He has some excellent healthy choices on the menu!! I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"After walking into Graz I first noticed the organized and cute chalkboard menu behind the bar. I only had a brief glance before being greeted from one of their friendly female workers. She asked me if I had been there before and when I said no, she continued to walk all the way around the counter just  to walk me through their menu and concept. For being a quick grab-n-go lunch place, I received the customer service of a sit down restaurant. Fabulous!

I proceeded to order an iced coffee with a sandwich and side of pasta salad. The woman behind the counter even asked me if i wanted my pasta salad \"plated\", even though it comes in a ready to eat container. I passed on the offer but was touched it was even offered!

The pesto pasta salad was to die for as was the sandwich and coffee! I ordered the Italian sandwich- which was fresh and tasty. 

As I was sitting and enjoying my lunch, a large group of 15 or so young folks came in for a visit. One of Graz's employees (either a chef or manager I'm not sure which one), came up to talk the group about the culinary industry. Turns out these kids were visiting different restaurants because they were interested in the culinary industry. The chef (I assume chef) gave an encouraging and supportive message which made it obvious he was passionate about his job. 

I never get out to have lunch by myself but I am sure glad I picked today to be that day. Thanks Graz! I will be back for coffee tomorrow!"}
{"text":"It seems they have pretty steady local business and for that, I'm happy.  I do wish the restaurant success as the staff was very nice but my meal was very underwhelming and nothing I would even consider trying again.  For $9 I had a sandwich which left me hungry as it was awfully small.  The sandwich was pressed on the grill and still came out cold and flavorless.  For $25 for lunch for two, it should at least leave me full.  Good for them on the profit margin though.  Selling two slices of thin bread, 3 oz of roast beef, and a tomato for $9 is a lucrative racket."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  hands down one of the best healthy restaurants I've enjoyed. Their sandwiches are incredible all the way to the bread! I ate one of the Pesto Pasta Salad Bowls while waiting for my sandwich...had to buy 2 more when I left - UNBELIEVABLE! Definitely a place to eat!"}
{"text":"Luv the Blue Hero and Chopped Salad... 10% go back to the 100 Club... Thank you!!! For the month of August."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times I was VERY happy with the food and extremely impressed with the customer service.  The gentleman who greeted me the minute i walked in the door made sure all my questions and needs were met with full co-operation.  I would recommend Graz to my friends and will surely be eating there again.  Good Job people!!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome sandwich today called the Flying Pig. Food is fresh and delicious and the owners are courteous and attentive. This is not your local subway with absent minded teenagers taking your order. Overall I highly recommend for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"We love this place! The BHT is an awesome choice and so is the kaleslaw. Graz is comfort food done healthfully. They also have delicious fresh pressed juices. The staff is always welcoming and they go out of their way to make sure everyone leaves happy."}
{"text":"Superb!  I had the \"Ultimate BFast Mack\".  Everything was perfect.  The jalapenos, spinach and tomatoes were fresh and properly ripened.  The egg was hot and fluffy and ample, the meats were of good quality.  Better than Einstein.  Don't overlook this fine local establishment."}
{"text":"I took my family here for the first time last Saturday. We were greeted with a warm hello and it must have been obvious to the owner that we were new because he said, \"you guys look scared! \"We laughed and he began to give us a nice orientation of the menu. He gave us samples to try and really made us feel at home. The sandwiches we ordered were bomb.com and were made by the owner himself. The kale slaw and Pasta salad were great sides that accompanied the huge sandwiches we had. The bread was perfectly pressed and toasted.

The staff was friendly and offer refills on our iced teas. There is no doubt in our minds that we will return to GRAZ."}
{"text":"Amazing people and amazing food! Every single item I have ordered here has tasted great and fresh. When you walk in the door they always greet you with a hello and a smile. You won't leave here disappointed. This is one of the best spots in town."}
{"text":"Refreshing lunch spot on the NE corner of Pecos and Arizona. I got the bounty juice, and a romaine boat which was like a lettuce wrap. Both were tasty and refreshing. Will definitely come back to try some sandwiches. This place has like 6 grilled cheese sandwiches if you are into that as well. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow! I literally cannot say enough good things about Gr?z. The owners are kind and personable. The food is fresh and delish! It's easy to find and conveniently located. Our first experience was great and we'll definitely be back!

The Green Goddess grilled cheese was divine, grilled to perfection where the bread was crisp on the outside and soft on this inside. Every bite was heaven. The Real BLT was so yummy that I had a tough time sharing any with my hubby, lol. The bacon was cooked perfectly! The greens mix was a nice change from plain lettuce and it had just enough mayo for flavor and moisture without being saturated. My daughter also loved the quesadilla and the kid's meals include apple juice and a side.  

The restaurant is quite small so that could be a bit of an issue as they get more popular but it's nicely decorated, bright, and clean. Plenty of parking in the lot as well. 

This is a local, small, family run business and everything is made to order fresh. You will not be dissapointed! I can't wait to try their breakfast sammies the next time I go, which will be soon! I will be recommending Gr?z to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been meaning to check this place out for sometime. Marcus and Angie greeted us at the door, and recommended some pretty amazing looking grilled cheese sandwiches. We were actually there for breakfast, despite it being 11am. I got a egg and pesto sandwich on a panini style 9 grain bread. Simple, but tons of flavor with the pesto .  I also got a mango banana juice which was very clean tasting, not overly sweet, and kind of a smoothie like consistency, which I dig. 

All their spreads are made in house which is neat, and Marcus told us a little more about the shop and how nearly everything they do is made from scratch.

My girlfriend got oatmeal, as she's no much of a breakfast person, and liked the oats they use for it, along with the strawberries. 

Overall a great experience! We will definitely be back for those grilled cheese"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a negative star. I had an hour long lunch break they had no one in there store there employees were rude. After waiting for 20 minutes to get a salad and juice they made the wrong juice made me wait even longer and finally when I went to eat my salad there was a hair in my food. I will make sure to tell all of my friends and family to make sure they never go here!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in to Graz was their hospitality. All of the folks behind the counter greeted me, asked me if it was my first time and shared information about the menu and specials. I had eaten their food as we ordered it in for an office event but I had never visited there. Their interesting take on fresh is what brought me in and will keep me coming back. I had the romaine boats which were fresh pieces of romaine with a chopped salad filling made of delicious feta, pepperoni and turkey. My husband had the Lo which was a fresh green salad with an interesting goat cheese pesto dressing. The fresh basil and other flavors were bright and delish. I can't wait to go back for breakfast...today's special was one of their amazing cinnamon rolls stuffed with eggs, bacon and a host of other stuff. Wow... Nice to see a fresh and innovative place doing so well in Chandler."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a big fan of sandwiches but I definitely like fresh.  This place is absolutely fantastic!   I had the Athena sandwich.  She recommended to have it warm--not cold so I agreed.  The sandwich was heated so the hummus warmed...then they opened it up and added the fresh stuff so the hummus flowed on top of it. Crispy delicious bread.  Complex flavors. Soooooo good.  Sandwich genius!

Service was terrific too.  The order taker was enthusiastic and food came quickly (which was good as we had a meeting and were pressed for time).   If I was lucky enough to live in the area, I would be a regular here!   In the meantime, I'm bookmarking so I will return the next time in town.  I would like to try the juices too!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had bought a Groupon for here since I knew I was going to be in the Gilbert area for work and wanted to try some places out. Came in ordered the Italian. It was amazing. Staff is super friendly. Asked if eating in or to go I said here, and then made a comment about eating outside. The guy said oh go ahead I'll bring your food out to you. Very nice and they even came out and checked on me to ensure everything was good. I plan to come here a lot while I'm in Gilbert for work. Excited to try more sandwiches. Came here a second time and brought a co-worker with me try it. We both loved the food, now my co-worker is telling others at work about it. This place makes sandwiches interesting not boring."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but with Flavorful coffee and excellent, steel-cut oatmeal. Various options with the oatmeal; I had mine with brown sugar and a banana which was perfectly ripe. Reasonable prices and excellent food. Recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've gone back and forth on actually writing a review on this place, mostly because I hate writing negative reviews but felt my experience had to be shared. I have visited GRAZ several times. Generally staff was friendly, and the food ok. Not great, not bad, but ok. I kept giving them a shot as I prefer to support local, and so many of my fellow Yelpers seem to enjoy this place. On my last visit however, I was thoroughly disappointed. I had a Yelp check In offer that I wanted to use on my order. The man at the register seemed very upset that I had this and said it was not longer valid and \"didn't know why that kept popping up\". There was no apology, no offer to honor the offer, or even offer me something else for the inconvenience. Even a sincere apology would have been greatly appreciated. I'm bummed I was treated the way I was, in such a rude manner. I don't know if I am willing to give them another shot at this point, but hope they can use this review to improve on their customer service skills. BTW Yelp check In offer for them is still popping up on my app."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was not busy, but our order of 2 sandwiches took quite awhile to be delivered. I got the BHT, but there was not enough ingredients inside to be flavorful. Every bite was basically the toasted bread flavor taking over, not the contents of the sandwich.

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. The restaurant is small, so when they run the juicer it's so loud you can't hear what your friends are saying!"}
{"text":"So I went into Graz 15 minutes before they were closing and the people working there were nothing but kind and willing to talk to me about their menu. It's my first time and they took the time to go over the menu and help me make some accommodations to my sandwich that I wanted. The food is great and the people are kind. It's definitely a place to go."}
{"text":"Super friendly owners & cute little sandwich, salad and smoothie shop. I had the B.L. Cheese sandwich with the pesto pasta salad and it was great. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is fresh and tasty.   Definitely the place to go for a quick and healthier lunch!"}
{"text":"The owner here was so incredibly nice, the restaurant is clean and inviting and they have a bunch of great, healthy delicious options. I got the Rise and Shine egg on toast with pesto sandwich and it was delightful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came in just 10 minutes before they were going to close and still had a fantastic experience!  We weren't made to feel awkward because they were ready to go home and the food was very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the good variety of items on the menu and the awesome service will definitely make this a place where we'll return!"}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to Yelp a few months ago and it is amazing!! They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses, breads from Jonathan Robbins Bakery and all fresh ingredients. They offer breakfast and lunch, mostly sandwiches and salads. They have fresh juice blends (try The Grove: Orange, Pineapple, Banana) as well. 

I feel good about eating here because the place is clean, you can see how your food is prepared and nothing is fried. I never leave here feeling over full; it's always the perfect amount of food. 

I've only been here twice but both times I have had a great experience. The owner is very friendly, welcoming and focused on service. He always makes sure you enjoy your meal.

Everything here is made to order and they are trying new things all the time. On Tuesday through August 11th they are featuring a sandwich special and plan to offer some new menu items this fall based on the success of the specials.

Make sure you check them out and support your local small business owners!"}
{"text":"Graz is fantastic! The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff greeted us in a way that made us feel welcomed. The place has a community feel to it, like you belong. And the food! Mmmm. I ordered the green goddess sandwich with a side of kale slaw and my husband got the four cheese salute and a side of pesto pasta salad. The immediate thing we noticed was how fresh everything was! The spinach was a vibrant green, the kale slaw was crisp. And, unlike other sandwich places I've been to, Graz doesn't skimp on the ingredients. My sandwich had plenty of spinach and nice, big slices of avocado. My husband's sandwich was the perfect blend of cheeses for just the right flavor. Everything was delicious, the service was top notch, and the food was prepared to order right in front of us. I'm hooked! I can't wait to go back and try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great place. Went for a late lunch. One of the best sandwiches I ever had. The owner was extremely helpful and inviting. Definitely a go-back to place"}
{"text":"I love this place. Like seriously crave their food when I go a week without it. I believe I've ordered the \"Fly me to the Moon\" breakfast sandwich about 10 times already. I take it with turkey and no mayo. It makes me happy. It tastes glorious. 

I was sick a couple of days ago and their \"Orange Affair\" smoothie made me feel so much better. 

I've come here for lunch several times too. Do yourself a favor and eat the Mac and cheese. The owner is a delight. If you're ever indecisive like I am he will recommend the best stuff. He knows me by face and somehow remembers what I always like! 

Will never stop coming here!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy is all I have to say.  Based on Yelp a friend and I visited Graz for lunch.  We were not disappointed.  Food was great and unique.  Constructive criticism.  Need more seating.  I am short I don't like being blocked from seeing the sandwich makers by a piece of dark plexiglass.  I'll definitely return to try more of the yummy yummy."}
{"text":"Wow! What a total disappointment this place turned out to be! There was a bit of a line but with several employees on the clock, they did a poor job of getting the food out in a timely manner. They must have just been cooking one order at a time... whatever the problem, it was very inefficient. 

But I could have forgiven the wait if the food was worth it. It wasn't. When we first got our food, I was astounded at how small the sandwiches were (considering the hefty price tag). To add insult to injury, there was way more cabbage on my sandwich than there was cheese and meat. 

We went several miles out of our way to try eating there and I regret it. But, even if this restaurant was right across the street, I wouldn't eat there again. And I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone. Don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Love the healthy eats menu. Staff are super nice, second time here and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I stopped in because this place is close to me and I wanted a sandwich. I had the flying pig..,turkey breast, applewood smoked bacon, roasted tomatoes, herb spread, & Havarti cheese on sourdough. It was really good. The customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Got the Athena with a cup of the Chimichurry Chicken soup.  Both were fresh and great flavors."}
{"text":"I am excited to have Graz in the hood.  It opens at 0700 so I can grab my daily green juice or a bowl of healthy oatmeal with my add-ons.  So far, so good.  By the way, it is a fresh juice bar.  I will be there often."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their salads are delicious, filling and super fresh. I love getting kale, spinach and lettuce in a big salad. 
Their sandwiches and amazing and flavorful. And they're even willing to make my food whole30 compliant when I ask."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly atmosphere. Quick ordering and food delivery. The food was very good!!!
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations after reading the reviews but those were not even close to being met. Cashier said that breakfast sandwich could be made into a wrap - I ordered Morning Glory as a wrap, with bacon & spinach - It would've been kind if she'd have mentioned the upcharge for the \"upgrade\" to a wrap ($1.25+) and the ($.50+) additional charge for adding a bit of spinach. $12.05 for this wrap & a small coffee felt like a gouge! ... Then the coffee took at least 10 minutes and the breakfast wrap took forever! And it arrived without bacon on it--aargh! .. Then my niece spotted a dead bug under our table... The wrap was of good quality but no flavor and the coffee was okay... The bacon that was given to me on the side upon pointing out their error on the wrap, was good and crispy - would've been nice inside the wrap but I was too hungry to wait any longer.. I eat many meals out (daily) and live pretty near this place but don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm just gonna get to the point. Food was good but everything was waaaaay~~~ overpriced! We ordered 2 sandwiches + 2 sides + 2 drinks = total $38! Since the sandwiches were $9 each, we thought it came with sides but nope. Sides were $3 each. The food was good but not that good. With that price you think at least the portion size would be big but nope. Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place as I frequent the nail salon a few doors down. I was excited to find a place that serves fresh food! The owners and staff are very friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide so I just went with a BLT. It was very fresh and tasty. I saw someone using a groupon and I decided to purchase for my next visit. Looking forward to trying their fresh juices as well."}
{"text":"if you are looking for an amazing twist on some sandwiches & salads...this is the place. Quick service, fresh food and it tastes great! I've tried a lot of the items on the menu and they are all good from the juices to sandwiches. If you are in the area for lunch or breakfast (delicious breakfast sandwiches and burritos) check it out!"}
{"text":"Graz is a great place, run by great people. Locally owned, locally operated with incredible grilled cheese. I'm happy to have a place like this in Chandler. If you haven't tried out Graz yet, do your taste buds a favor!"}
{"text":"You have to come check it it for yourself to take in all the awesomeness of this place and the people. I love the Breakfast options. My favorite is the Morning Glory or Fly Me To The Moon. And the Orange Affair Fresh Juice Blend is always on point.

If you want Lunch they have some of the \"Best Grilled Sandwiches in Arizona\" as the azcentral.com article stated. I like The Earl or The B.L. Cheese and the Cinnamon Rolls will have you not wanting to share it with anyone. LOL. 

Great location and very nice and comfortable set up for dining in. 

I recommend you stop by today and give them a try for Breakfast or Lunch, and tell Marcus how much you love his Cardinals."}
{"text":"I tired the panni and it was tasty but I was not super impressed with my sandwich. I appreciate that it's suppose to be healthier and customer service was nice.  A decent panini. I may go back to give some other items on the menu a try."}
{"text":"I've passed this place numerous times and never got the chance to stop until now. I ordered the Zeus which was made to order and tasted great! I love to try new things and this was well worth it. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Graz for a while, because of the amazing reviews. I anticipated something akin to a NY lunch spot; high quality and great tasting food at a good price. Sadly, the food didn't stack up to my expectations. 

The great:

Service was friendly and everyone was incredibly accommodating. Food was made expeditiously and served promptly, with a smile. We were approached and asked several times if we needed anything. 

The breakfast sandwich that we ordered for our son was yummy - scrambled eggs, cheese and ham on a brioche bun. He liked it and ate it heartily. I had about half of the remainder of his sandwich and found it to be a perfect breakfast to go. 

The ok:

I ordered the roast beef sandwich, cutely named \"Roast Beast\" and asked for the sandwich to be pressed. The flavor of the bread fell short; bland and a little north of toasted and headed into burned territory. The roast beef was thin and tender but...lacking. I wanted some punchy and strong roast beef flavor (juicy, salty) maybe some strong and forward horseradish flavor. All of the ingredients just blended together and there were no distinct or forward flavors. 

My husband ordered the salad and the presentation was lackluster - served in a plastic basket with a paper liner. He enjoyed his food and said that he liked it. He said it wasn't fantastic but fine. 

We also ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup for our son. I had a few spoonfuls of it and it didn't have the rich depth that one would expect from a chicken noodle soup. I wished that it had some meaty flavors but it also fell flat on its face - one noted. 

I was expecting a place that offered delicious morsels, a rarity, sadly, in the east valley. What we had were one-toned. There's so much you can do with the flavors of a sandwich (add some chipotle mayo, or aioli instead of just mayo?) or perhaps change the type of bread or ease up on the pressing. I felt like something's gotta give and they're so close to hitting it on the head, but not quite there yet."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The juices are excellent. I had something with beets, and it was great. The wheatgrass shot was nice too. Unfortunately they really don't have that many vegetarian or vegan options. I hope they decide to expand their menu. 

Service is good. I'm happy to support a good local business."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and good prices. We had huge chunks of lettuce, the heart, and had to take that off but everything else was great.
We will be back, just hold the lettuce."}
{"text":"$17 for a sandwich and juice. Overpriced for what you get. Tastes good, but no original flavors. My green goddess was decent, but the avocado was not ripe, hard. My juice was more ground than strained. This was my second time here, thinking it may be improved. Won't be coming back. They should get a better juicer. I've had a bigger, tastier sandwich at Dilly's Deli."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! The staff is so friendly and the juices/food is great! Highly recommend to anyone in the Chandler area :)"}
{"text":"Great little place to get breakfast or lunch. Fresh bread & ingredients. Make sure to check in for $3 off your meal. Will be back"}
{"text":"Since I moved nearer to Chandler this place has been on top of my yelp every time I look for somewhere to eat. Great reviews and I love hipster places that have chalkboard inside and has grilled cheese. Me and my gf finally tried it on Friday afternoon and sadly was really disappointed and frankly, skeptical.

We wanted to get each something but then realized their grilled cheese was $10.. for two piece of bread and filling. We ordered one zeus-something and shared bc of the price.. it was good but I wouldn't pay $10 again. I tried their juice for $7 and it just tasted like water filtered with grass with some pink coloring, I threw it away on my way out while they weren't looking.

The owner and the gentleman who took my order were very nice people but I'm really skeptical how this place has all 5 star reviews and is always on top of every category listing I see. I would advise to make their business based on repeat customers and not new ones from yelp. If the grilled cheese were half cheaper and was something I could only get from GRAZ I would come back every now and then."}
{"text":"Healthy eating is my goal. I've passed this place a few times. Decided to check it out for lunch. My turkey sandwich was very satisfying. The service was great. The next day I went for breakfast. I hate oatmeal, Marcus fixed my oatmeal up so good that I believe I didn't know how to make oatmeal in the first place. This has been a wonderful experience. I'm loving healthy eating !!!"}
{"text":"Order a couple breakfast sandwiches and they were both a hit in my house. A little pricier than your average run of the mill breakfast sandwich but in my opinion worth it. Customer service was also an extreme plus."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I've been looking for a healthier option for lunch and this place is perfect. Not only is it healthier than most places, but it is actually delicious. I had the green goddess sandwich (grilled cheese with avocado, pesto, and other delicious items) and it was delightful. The guy working was also very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, staff friendly and attentive. My friends & I shared a fresh baked  goodie for dessert after my awesome grilled mozzarella, pesto, turkey sandwich  - yummmmm 

Glad I purchased their Groupon - they've only been open a month. I hope they make it cause it's small local business and a nice change to the typical stuff on the corner. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"It's hidden and it's a gem! I usually feel too full, bloated and sick after a sandwich. At Graz I felt like I made a healthy and extremely delicious choice. No guilt! I will be coming back. I got the Zeus grilled cheese ps. Go try it!!"}
{"text":"Great Fresh salads soups sandwiches and more!  Owner & Staff give world class 5 Star customer service..I feel like fam"}
{"text":"Second time in today! Must say I felt I needed to write a review. Not only is the food fresh and yummy but both times I've had excellent service! Very friendly in there. If you like juice they also make a fantastic juice collection! Never hurts to at least go once!"}
{"text":"I get why this place is rated so well.  They have way more options than their menu shows and the bread for the sandwiches are ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"The staff is always so friendly! They walk you through the menu your first time in, and are always helpful with questions. The food is delicious as well! We have done both breakfast and lunch (iced coffee both times), and they're both amazing. Just keep in mind, 32oz of coffee is more than you're probably thinking!"}
{"text":"I can't think of any negatives for this place. The food is delicious, there are many choices and they are always doing new specials. The ingredients are also top notch. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 

I live in the area and am really glad we have some restaraunts coming up in the area. I hope they do well and stay here for a long time!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich, a bit slow, however great server. Love the local feel. $10.45 for breakfast sandwich and small coffee felt pricy. I'm going to try lunch when I'm again in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The place is located where the former Quisnos was. The decoration is nice and attractive. The staff acknowledges you right away and is available. The wait is usually short but I would call ahead if during rush hours. They have tables for you to sit so you can decide to eat in or take out. They serve breakfast, lunch and juice.

So I decided to go there and try them out. I thought the food was good but you get really little for what you pay, it doesn't seem to be a good value to me though. A $8.50 sandwich of this size should be around $6 mark top. 

Sure, you may find quality ingredients but you are paying a premium for it as the quantity is minimal.

That's too bad. I tried the Zeus one time and the Flying pig sandwich another time, both were good (nothing special in flavor though) but I stayed hungry when done as the portion looks like a kids grilled sandwich one. I'm 6.1, 165Lbs, I believe I need a bit more than 400 calories to subsist. 

They also have juice.... I haven't tried as you get more of the calories than the benefits.

So, if I was paying full price (not with a Groupon), I would probably skip it as it is not a good ratio quality/quantity/value, you'll be hungry soon after you ate. With a Goupon it makes it a bit more affordable which allows you to try it out and make your own opinion but still, I guess I won't be a customer. Sigh..."}
