{"text":"I won't go overboard to gush on the place but definitely worth a visit to try out. The food was good but the seating was a little crowded and the place was really LOUD. Perhaps another visit might raise (or lower) my rating of A-OK. The service was good. The pricing a little high but not out of sight. I'll call it \"average\" in all categories. I was neither overly satisfied nor completely disappointed. We didn't have the pizza although coming from Antonio's next door I can assure you would have been a better choice than the fish dinners we had. Live and learn."}
{"text":"Terrible! Went on Tuesday for wing night.  These were smallest wings I have ever eaten in my life, I actually didn't know wings could that small, and they did not have enough sauce.  I spoke to the manager and he didn't care. 
 I have been coming here for 15 years.  This place used to be great and packed every night.  Every time I return it gets worse and worse.
On yelp 3 years ago it was averaging  5 stars and now it's averaging 1 star this year.  Makes sense to me.  Don't go here. I expect it to be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Owner very concerned with the quality of food and customer service.  Very happy with TM from ownership, food quality, to employees.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends & family.  Thanks, Anthony for your high standards & standing by your food!  Dan K."}
{"text":"Foods good. To bad the waiting staff is horrible and rude. We called ahead that we were bringing in a party. When we got there we had one waitress who huffed and puffed every time we ordered anything. That was of course when we got her attention, she was busy avoiding us like the plague. Since our waitress sucked, I just went up to the bar. The bar tender was even worse. I tried to order shots and she stomped off. We never even got them, we just took our party across the street to crystal keg."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had poor service.  Have been here before and never experienced slow service like this.  We waited 25 minutes just to order, food took a while and the order wasn't correct.  Very disappointed.  I wish I could blame it on the place being busy, but there weren't many people there."}
{"text":"I have been there SEVERAL times. Sat at the bar as well as tables they are quick with drinks (soda n a bottled beer) but, the food ALWAYS takes SO long. The server/bartender came by several times to check on us but, no food. The owner/manager was even there and gave us a discount because there was a problem with our food. A few hours later we were sick!!! It has happened EVERY time we ate there. I will NEVER go back,  unless I need to loose a quick 5 pounds."}
{"text":"I was invited here by a friend for a \"girls night out\". The band playing was Cool Breeze. I must say I don't understand any of the negative reviews. The food was awesome, our server was awesome. We didn't have to wait long for any thing! We left knowing this will be \"our place\". Thank you all for a great night! Oh, and by the way, there was more than 8 of us and the service was flawless!"}
{"text":"Tired this place out with a friend, just looking for a quick beer and bite to eat. Went in not busy at all, as we expected for a week day night at ten. We sat at the bar and waited ten mins to even be approach, just to be told they will be right with us. App stocking the beer and putting glasses away was way more important. Finally after another five mins the bartender came over, we asked if they had specials. She said blue moon 4.50. So my friend got that and a miller light for me. Not too hard right??? I was wrong, that took 12 mins. By this time the couple next to us who was waiting to order,  said very loudly forget this its been 45 mins and they still couldn't get a drink. Needless to say we didn't try to order food. Who knew how long that would take, considering the bartender never came back. Again too busy cleaning and wiping things to be bothered by silly little things like guest. We hurried drank our drinks and got out of there. On our way out we did notice both bartenders jump to get the servers drinks for them selves. App you need to work here to get decent service. 
As a fellow foodie I understand end of shift blahness and being tired and or busy, but when you have less than five people in the whole place and all are waiting to get something you have problems. Management needs to look at who they have and reconsider it. Take care of your guest, a very simple rule that app this place can not fallow... I will never come back and be sure and have already told others, and will say not many were surprised at all..sad."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a casual dinner.  Been here before and have liked the pizzas.  Ordered a couple pizzas and they were what we expected.  The service on the other hand was miserable.  Stay away from Colleen (blonde, glasses) as she ignored us for the last half hour (After we finished eating, purposely let her walk by 4, maybe 5x to see if she would ask about a carryout box, additional beverages, the check, etc.  She didn't make eye contact or stop at the table.)  The rating would have been better if not for the service."}
{"text":"The food was good but standard bar type food.  The wait was long and the staff was just ok.  Not planning on coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We were there with a large wedding party. The food was great, pasta wasnt mushy and the sauce was great. Service was fantastic! Even for our family asking for crazy stuff! We will come back whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR PIZZA. Seriously, when I think about their pepperoni pizza I start to drowl. I dream about the delicious pie meeting my tastebuds...weird yes I know, but it's awesome! 
Their staff is friendly and attentive, service is quick and wings and sandwiches are all very tasty. Go Here cause your missing out on some modern irish dishes and amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"I originally gave a rather poor review due to one unpleasant experience; however, since they were conscientious to reply to my post and compensate me for a second chance, I'm giving them four stars for excellent customer service! I'll keep you posted!"}
{"text":"Love The food. If you are familiar with Antonios pizza this is the same ownership. Ive always had great service and food. Nice alternative with creative menu."}
{"text":"Most times I come here the waitresses are rude and disinterested. It's like we are an inconvenience to them ordering food from the place. It really is a shame because the pizza is EXCELLENT. Deep dish is amazing. But their service brings them down majorly."}
{"text":"Tony Maloney's is never a disappointment.  Yes sometimes the service is slow but they are busy and courteous.  Salad, pizza, weekly specials, cold beer ..."}
{"text":"So I'm a couple days removed from having eaten dinner at Tony Maloney's. 

I guess if you think of TM's as a bar that serves food, it's a hit. I didn't drink but the drinks specials i saw looked promising and inexpensive. and they server food that wouldn't necessarily be served in most bars. 
However, if you look at it as a restaurant, it loses a bit of it's luster. 
The location is too small for such a big bar. Tables are very close together. 
I ordered the special penne a la vodka w/ shrimp. The taste was fine, if not kinda dull. It could have used some red pepper flake to give it some pop. Speaking of pop, my diet soda was flat and nearly lifeless. It was surprising to me that my dinner did not come with a salad. I had to order that separately and I'm glad i did. While the house poppyseed dressing was very thin and runny it tasted great and may have been the highlight of my meal."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was absolutely horrible! Server seemed overwhelmed with our table and there was hardly anyone in the place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, average bar with pretty good food. The bartenders weren't too friendly. Maybe bc they cant flirt for tips, well they could at least try I'm a good tipper lol. My friend was with me when he discovered their fired ravioli. He's now obsessed he goes there for lunch all the time. Good place if you're low maintenance, or to grab a basketball game."}
{"text":"I'm SO disappointed! I've been to Tony Maloney's dozens of times but today was our worst experience. Service is frequently slow but today was just ridiculous. After waiting over ten minutes we asked another server to locate ours. She came over and we ordered beverages and when she returned the pops were flat. We each ordered a sandwich and we ordered an appetizer of loaded fries. With my sandwich I also got a side salad instead of fries. So, fellow Yelpers, what order should these items come out? I'd say the appetizer, then my salad, then our sandwiches. Nope! All at once. Locating our server to do anything for us, including getting the check, was ridiculous. I love this neighborhood bar but it'll take a while before I return after this. They're lucky my food was yummy..."}
{"text":"First time customers and will be back soon!
My husband, 1 yr old and I ate today at Tony Maloney's for the first time. Our food and service was WONDERFUL! My daughter was fuzzy since she was hungry the moment we walked in. There was only 1 waitress on staff but she was Johny on the spot! When she came to our table we told her we would like to put in our daughters meal right away because faster food = happy baby. As soon as I said that and \"french bread pizza\" she ran over to the computer and put the order in that second! I was so impressed with her effort and speed. The pizza came out in a fast time for it being homemade and not frozen. My husband and I tried it and it was awesome! We joked that we will come back and just eat off the kids menu. We ordered the pepperoni bites, corn beef sandwich and a BLT. The corn beef sandwich was AMAZING! We loved the service and food. We will be back soon (FYI waitress was Kris and she was a doll)."}
{"text":"This has been a spot my family has been coming to for quite some time. Very friendly staff to start off. Any style pizza roll is to die for, truly one of a kind. Also a big fan of their ribs which are cheap on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! A friendly and comfortable atmosphere wit great service. Jess and Nicole were friendly and as will Ferrell would say \"scrumtrulescent\""}
{"text":"Try to visit every couple of weeks.  Favorite pizza is the Scilian crust.  Tonight we are enjoying cucumber martini's and a Mediterranean sale.  Tuesday is 1/2 price wings and although Cajun dry rub is the best,  we added garlic parmesean. Christina and Kelly were very attentive, always smiling. Great place to unwind."}
{"text":"Had lunch here Sunday. Service was barely satisfactory. I ordered half lb boneless wings ($7+$1 celery & blue cheese). The sauce was excellent but the chicken was over cooked. Mentioned it to my server and he did nothing. So I just ate what I could. My friend had spaghetti w meatballs. I thought it was pretty good, but he didn't care for it."}
{"text":"Friday had a group of friends to meet . The food was very good at lunch everyone some tried the eggplant stack , hamburgers and fish fry. No complaints by anyone.
.I have had the eggplant 3 times prior and always very good.

We will be back"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I live right around the corner and it is a nice place to walk up to and grab a drink with friends. Their beer selection is ok. Nothing too amazing, but it gets the job done. The food is pretty good. They have a really good Ruben that we will not only get when we are there, but we like to take out as well. It is linked with Antonio's which is right next door, so you can order off their menu as well, which allows for a lot of variety. 

Last time I was there the service was not great. A friend and I went up to get drinks and catch up and when we wanted to leave, our server disappeared for a good 30 min which made it hard to grab the bill and made for a later night than I would have liked. 

I personally miss the Blue Moose Saloon that used to be here, but this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"i first want to tell you that i have never walked out of a restaurant in my life....i can no longer say that.   the restaurant was 1/3rd full and there were more than enough servers to handle the \"rush\" on a Saturday afternoon.   I ordered the breakfast burger and my son ordered the rise and shine sandwich.  i would love to say that i could review the food but we got sick of waiting after 50 minutes.  the server came out with no apology, just a weak excuse(says that we came after a party of 8).  i actually felt strange complaining and leaving in front of my son.

i really wanted to like this place because it is right down the street from our new home, but that type of service is unacceptable.  we went next store to Subway and they stated that terrible service there is the norm.  after reading some reviews i would have to agree."}
{"text":"We received a gift card to go Antonio's Pizza.... Looked up the website and thought we could go to a pizza place.....no..... It's a carry out- but if you go next door to Tony Malonies you can get the same pizza but sit at the bar and eat it. 
We had Danielle as our server and was probably the best part of the experience.She went thru a list of the bar cocktails and beers and we ended up with a Jose Cuervo Margarita and a Moscow Mule. Then we ordered a pizza. Now my husband and I have been to Italy a few times and were expecting some type of Italian pizza- something close to our travels from the toe of Italy to the top. 
We ordered the Thin crust, regular sauce, ham and mushrooms. The crust was good, and the sauce had a lot of flavor.. but why oh why do pizza places use canned mushrooms,they become yellowish green and soft when baked. The ham had a great taste if it was on a salad. Big chunks...but again on a pizza? Maybe a thing slice / shaved ham would have been better. Not sure if we will go back- if we do it will be because we have money left on the card and we can already get a cocktail from Danielle."}
{"text":"Hey I just met you.  And this is crazy.  I love your Deep Dish.  More space maybe?

We visited Tony Maloney's on a Saturday afternoon.  The inside isn't very big especially with the massive bar situated in the middle of the room.  It was fairly crowded and they had a $10.99 prime rib special.  It looked like they were setting up for a band inside.  We opted to be immediately seated on the patio.  After using some of my negotiating skills on my wife she agreed to sharing their Deep Dish Pizza.  The provolone was yummy-gooey goodness.  Plenty of mushrooms, pepperoni, and onions filled the inside. The pepperoni was just the perfect crispiness.  The crust was angelic and some of the cheese was rolled into the edge of the pizza.  Topping substitutions were allowed... but why?  It was awesome as-is."}
{"text":"If you need a 90 minute client meeting, but you can only get them to agree to an hour, simply take them to lunch at Tony Maloney's.  The food is decent, not exceptionally overpriced, and the \"relaxed\" speed at which your food is prepared and delivered will get you the extra 30 minutes you desire.  I would not be opposed to coming back on half priced appetizer Thursdays and having some $3 All Day IPAs, but would make sure that I was not in a hurry on such occasions."}
{"text":"Do not go! Avoid Tony Maloney's at all costs. I started visiting the restaurant about 3 years ago and the service and food has consistently declined. This place used to be good. It's disappointing to say the least. Our last visit was beyond irritating!!! We waited 30 minutes for wings and there was only 2 other tables. After we got our wings they were room temperature and so small I couldn't believe they were wings. I'm pretty sure I was eating baby chicken wings which makes me uneasy and and super uncomfortable. When we ordered 2 staff workers said we could split the sauce for our wings then they refused to split the flavors. To top it off they said they were only going to put the sauce on the side. When we finally got our food they gave us ranch packets instead of the normal side of ranch. We asked to speak to the manager and he was defensive instead of understanding. We didn't eat all the wings to show the manager how small they were and he literally said \"yep that's a chicken wing\". We weren't looking for money back, we just wanted him to realize the lack of food quality and he just brushed us off! I understand restaurants have their bad moments but there is no excuse! The only saving grace was our waitress. She was so sweet! If I could give  0 out of 5 I would."}
{"text":"The food is good but the majority of the waitstaff is horrible. Certain servers are consistently poor. We know we will have our orders wrong, an extremely long wait for our food and the bill with certain employees here. We have waited over 20 minutes to place a drink order and walked out. Management doesn't appear to care about the poor service."}
{"text":"Food was good. I got the hamburg w/fries. Prepared correctly. Wife ordered the broasted chicken. She loves the broasted chicken and the jo-jo potatoes. Was piping hot. We both shared the special salad which is plenty for two people. Wife ordered a glass of wine. There was lipstick on the glass. Later she ordered another glass of wine. Yep...lipstick on that glass too. We've seen a lot of bartenders at other restaurants wiping the wine glass before they pour. Seems to me that should be a rule for bartenders. Service was very slow. Server disappeared after delivering our check. After waiting for several minutes, I went to the bar and asked the bartender to take my payment."}
{"text":"I love the food. It is some of the best around, but the service is so bad and so slow that it is not worth going to eat here. I have been going there for about a year on a regular basis bringing clients as well as my family at least once a week. Every single person has commented on the lousy, slow service. Today we got off the plane from a family vacation and went to Tony's  before going home. We were seated and no one came near us for more than 15 minutes. So we got up and left. The hostess saw us leaving, as well as the several servers standing around talking, and the hostess put her head down and walked away quickly. When I got out to the car I called and asked for the manager. The person that answered said he could help. I told him what happened and he apologized and offered a gift card. I declined it because even if the meal was free the service is so bad it isn't worth ever going back.

If you have a very long time to kill the food is good, but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday to have their prime rib special.  I knew about this special because a cousin had told us about it.  So, we thought we'd give it a try !!
So, our waitress takes our order.  I order french onion soup (which was nothing to brag about) and the prime rib with a potato.  I asked her to bring the soup before the meal and she said ok.  I, again, had to remind her and she stated it would be out shortly.  The person I was with had already got and ate her salad. Then here comes my soup.  After 4 mouthfuls...you'll never guess this one, but the dinner came out.  Then the final straw was when she came to our table when I was on my last bite of potatoes and says \"oh, I'm sorry but you have to purchase a drink with this or it is not valid and then I have to add $5.00 to your bill.\"  So, she did not let me know this until I was almost done.  Now why would I want a drink when I am ready to leave and had I known, I would not have purchased the soup and would have just gotten the required drink!!!!! Well management was no help and very poor management skills might I add. 
Needless to say, I WILL NEVER BE BACK AGAIN !!!!!! You have been warned !! Then the ultimate last issue was they charged me $17.99 and at the bottom only took off $4.00.  They still charged me a $1.00 more.  But, I mentioned this and the waitress stated she could not help me because it is what the computer does!! WHAT ???? I just needed to leave before my anger went up a notch !!!!
POOR POOR POOR !!!!!"}
{"text":"Service at dinner was unbelievably slow.  Entire table could not eat at once as dinners were brought out sporadically.  Melt sandwich had grease dripping out of it.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, friend & I went here for the first time the other day for dinner. I was expecting terrible service because of all the reviews on here ..& terrible service was what I got! First, we stood & waited to be seated for like 5 minutes while all the waitresses & bartenders just stared at us -- don't you think if your hostess is in the back you can step in to give us a seat? After standing there for 5+ minutes while everyone stared, we were finally greeted by the hostess whose first comment was \"Has anyone helped you guys?\". Yea someone has, we just like to stand here for fun?! We decided to sit out on the patio because it was a nice night out. The atmosphere was fun & a great place to sit outside with friends & eat & drink. But our service sucked. It took forever to order drinks, & forever to receive them.  Forever to order food, & FOREVER to receive it. But if there was anything positive about this experience, boy oh boy was it my food. I got a Club Melt & let me say ..it was FANTASTIC! The fries were decent, but my sandwich was just superb. It was huge though, so I was only able to eat half. My boyfriend & friend both ordered the wings. Both complimented their wings, although they thought they were pretty pricey. ($16 for about 16-20 wings) All in all it wasn't the worst experience of my life, but definitely not the best. This place really needs to work on their service, but they do get 3 stars for their food. Thumbs up to the cook!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Half price appetizers on Thursday this is the spot. Food is amazing staff is so friendly. Shannon the bar tender is just a love! Little bit of a wait for food but they keep the conversation going. Everything was clean and even other customers were friendly enough to talk to. A real home like feeling with extended family."}
{"text":"All I have had are the pepperoni nuggets, and they are incredible. The place is clean, the service is good, and the prices are reasonable.

There is plenty of seating, and there are numerous tvs showing sports, if that's what you are into."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely AMAZING! Bought a groupon and will definitely be coming back. The only problem was the service. We were seated in a back corner where they use the area as an outdoor seating bar. They only had one waitress for 8 tables and she could not keep up. It took forever for drink refills. However once our order was placed the food arrived within 15 minutes or so.  I will definitely be back but they need to step it up on their service. If one waitress is expected to serve that small of an area, they need to be trained to move faster!"}
{"text":"Okay this place wasn't awful -- but it was lacking some key components that didn't make it as good as it might seem; especially under the circumstances. 

I went with my boyfriends family around happy hour, and the place had a decent number of people there. We were promptly seated and menus were given. The server immediately came over and gave us our drinks, and gave us an extra second to look at the menu. 

The atmosphere was your typical sports bar; nothing too fancy. They had really good specials (daily and seasonal) along with local favorites. The most \"odd\" was a spaghetti (which my boyfriends dad got and it was a very decent portion of food), but everything was typical sports bar food. 

Anyways, we ordered our food and it took a bit longer than I expected; and most people in the restaurant already had their food, so it didn't look crazy busy with newer customers. When the food did come out, some of the extras we had ordered (for example I ordered a ranch and celery) took quite a while to get out to the point that my wings were cold by the time they got there. Our server was no where to be found. 

Sadly, the food that we got was not extraordinary. It was just okay. I got the boneless wings and they were not crispy, and the sauce just wasn't anything special. The fries, however were good. They were extremely crispy and had a good bit of flavor. My boyfriend got the bucket of bones which included ribs and chicken wings -- sadly, you weren't able to choose what flavor wing sauce you got (same sauce as the ribs), and the chicken wings were baked, so they were not crispy in the slightest. I'm surprised that the fries were crispy and the chicken wings were not. 

Remember how I said there was pasta? That was the best thing that we got. It was a huge portion and came with garlic bread and a side salad. 3 types of pasta you can choose from as well as either meatballs or sausage. I've heard both options are good. 

On top of it, when it came down time to use our Yelp coupon, it took them 15 minutes to take off the bill because a manager had to do it. Sadly, that, along with the slow service had to take off one star, along with the food being eh also had to take off one star. I would say middle of the road place. Prices aren't terrible but I would not recommend the chicken wings. 

Pasta and burgers apparently."}
{"text":"We have had two bad experiences recently. We sat for over 15 minutes without any acknowledgement from the bar tenders. This place is going down fast. I will not return."}
{"text":"We eat her often but it seems like service gets worse each time. I ordered a pizza tonight but they said the oven was broken and no pizzas for the night. So we ordered the ribs. When we were waiting over a half hour I noticed the pizza drivers in and out delivering pizzas that I was not able to get. Meanwhile we did not get our salad or dinner.  We left without getting food. I think the management needs to pay a little more attention. We will have to find another place to go"}
{"text":"So I went to this place during a time when I couldn't eat bread. Big mistake!!! The pizza smelled heavenly. Tasted heavenly too according to my husband.

They've got a little patio on the side, and my husband had a great time sitting there and enjoying the warm day. It helped that they had a drink menu with a bunch of different choices. 

Service was great. The server was super helpful and attentive. I'd definitely recommend this place as a restaurant to grab a casual meal."}
{"text":"Hit this place up with the fam while I was home and it was pretty radical. I had a pierogi sandwich that was delish but I highly recommend splitting it with your lover or something because it amounts to just wayyy too many carbs for one meal! I also had a couple bites of pizza and holy farm animal it was wonderful. Perfect amount of everything and just all around delectable.

The food here absolutely deserves 4 to 5 stars but the service was slow and inconsistent. I should probably just chalk it up to the holiday season but a first impression is a first impression!"}
