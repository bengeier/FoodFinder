{"text":"Good service, good broth. Everything is fresh and made to order. Glad to have a new go-to pho place."}
{"text":"As mentioned in other reviews, very sweet and friendly family run business. However, there's more to this place than just the pho. They make a nice wonton soup, which is simple yet comforting. They also make a lovely Tom yum soup with coconut milk and their hot and sour Thai beef noodle soup is killer! Perfectly balanced in flavour and leaves you feeling energized! Also, if you're not in the mood for soup, they make delicious flame-kissed pork chops."}
{"text":"Excellent repas! Nous sommes allés dans ce restaurant par hasard et nous n'avons pas regretté. 
Le service était excellent, la soupe volcano était succulente. Un restaurant qui vaut la peine et où nous retournerons souvent."}
{"text":"I live on this block and decided to give it a blind try even though i never heard of it.
I was amazed! Extremely nice service, fast and most of all delicious!
I love Tonkinoise soup and the soup was fresh, plenty of meat. They don't cheap out on ingredients! So happy I tried :)"}
{"text":"Saw this place while driving on Sherbrooke and decided to pop in and see what it was like.    I was here before 11:30 AM and it was already quite busy inside.

Cute little place,nothing too out of the ordinary. 
Very nice servers, pretty damned good grilled chicken Tonkinese soup with a small side plate of extremely fresh bean sprouts.    Price for my lunch after tax was $9.88.    Nice!

It doesn't look so fancy from the street and it certainly isn't a very fancy area,  but it was way better than expected and I would absolutely come again."}
{"text":"This place always makes me feel warm & happy! The soups are very filling and absolutely on point! The Tom yum with coconut milk is just so damn good. But really, you can't go wrong with most of their stuff and it is very cheap. Love the fried tofu (really generous portion), the pho, and the wonton soup. I wouldn't order again the fried dumplings, but that's about it.
Oh, and the owners/staff are super sweet."}
{"text":"First time having pho in a long time and my fave experience so far! Got the shrimp noodle soup (beef broth, not spicy) and tried the vegetarian spring rolls. My sister got the vegetarian tom yum with coconut milk. Delicious! What a flavour bomb. Mine was more mild in flavour. The owners are so likeable and the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night. The soups are so filling that there's no need to get an appetizer tbh. Great experience and will be going back."}
{"text":"Owners are very sweet and the food is always good and affordable. The restaurant itself is cozy and clean, but I think I've only ever eaten takeout."}
{"text":"Not the best pho place in Montreal but it's up there. The menu has a good amount of selection between soups and other dishes. They also offer a lunch menu to make things easier and the prices are good. I liked their broth but just a little less flavour than I like. The staff is great. Very accommodating and friendly. Lunch hour is super busy so give yourself some time if you decide to try it for lunch."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already. Pho is excellent and the beef is great and lean, no fat. However the last time I went they were a bit stingy with it. The staff and owner are super kind and have that grateful vibe about them which I love. Sweet family owned business. Good prices and service. Would recommend! 

+ I just had their Pad Thai. Wasn't the greatest. Tasted like they used Ketchup. Sauce was too rich for my liking. But shrimps were good."}
{"text":"Always packed.
I had been dying to try this place for awhile and when I finally did, I was not disappointed!
Best general Tao I've had in a long while, service was great and the prices were very fair.
I would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Went back in person and with other people. Perfectly good with large portion sizes! I am rewriting my review to reflect my positive experiences."}
{"text":"I've ordered the P5, which is pho with rare beef and well done flank. I add my preferred balance of hot and oyster sauce. The heat and flavors hit the back of the throat, perfect for when you are feeling under the weather. Makes me break a sweat too, so you know it's good.

Safe is quick and friendly, restaurant is clean, servings are large portions, and the price is fair!

Definitely recommend their soup if you're trying to recover from a cold or when you wanna warm up on a cold, rainy day."}
{"text":"Si vous cherchez un très bon rapport qualité/ prix, je vous conseille ce petit restaurant sur la rue Sherbrooke Ouest. Les propriétaires sont très sympas et serviables, les soupes sont succulentes et les prix sont pas cher du tout. 
J'adore la soupe Volcan et la soupe Tom Yum au crevettes"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and quick service during dinner. Average-sized portion and good tasting rice vermicelli with grilled chicken and imperial roll. Their chicken tonkinoise soup (with grilled or boiled chicken options) strangely has cabbage, carrots and broccoli. It was still good but it's different from what you'd expect from an authentic style. Decent restaurant on Sherbrooke."}
{"text":"Not the best Pho in the area but its worth a try.....they put carrots and brocolis in their broth wich is not exactly what you expect from a typical tonkinoise soup and they could have put more meat! The rolls were tasty and big though!! Overall....the staff is very kind and the food is cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Petit resto à côté de chez moi,  je l'adore ! 
La dame est trop mignonne et gentille 
Je prend du Take Out a chaque fois et c'est toujours délicieux !  De bonnes portions ! La soupe Coco curry poulet est wow !!! C'est mon must ! 
Deux seuls petits hics,  ils ferment tôt pour moi ... je termine souvent le travail à 21h :/ puis les deux fois que j'ai pris le boeuf teriyaki,  la sauce est excellente , mais la viande est très grasse et avec beaucoup de nerfs .. difficile à manger .. mais mise à part ça,  tout est parfait !!!"}
{"text":"Free tea if you ask for it !! gentle service, standart dishes, crunchy fried ice cream for desert mmmmmm . Just a few tables so come early."}
