{"text":"Went for afternoon lunch to sit on the patio and just relax.  It was not very busy at all.

Ordered some wine... Got the wrong sized glass... Not too much of a problem.  Ordered an appetizer which was received after the meal...  More of a problem.  Of the two entrees one was completely wrong...  So basically every step of the meal was messed up.  Oh ya... I was asked if I wanted some ketchup to which I replied sure.  But never got any ketchup.  Why offer if you will not bring it.  Didn't even get a pen to sign the bill.

Here's an idea... If you can't remember what people order, then try writing it down.

I've been here several times, but this time was my last... Terrible service which serves to negate any positives of the restaurant.  Just terrible service...  Really bad.  Our waitress should be fired... Not even an apology for all the errors."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, great food, great atmosphere, great and courteous service. Definitely a place to check out when in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Expensive but at least the food is pretty good! Nice atmosphere, so good for a night out/date. The menu is a little limited, but whatever you order will probably be tasty."}
{"text":"Generally the food here is pretty good. We go here particularly for the foie gras poutine. Its a treat!

The service however, needs vast improvement. The wait time for a water bottle refill was 15+ minutes. We ended up asking the manager for the water.  

Our bill was $97 and I gave 2 $100 bills. The server returned with $100 in $5 bills saying they were out of other denominations....are you serious!?!? On a Friday night!? Yeah right..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for dinner in Mississauga. Every time I have been there the food as been excellent. In fact, I think the worst we ever had was when the garlic mashed potatoes were merely \"good\" - rather than outstanding. It was a suprise to us more than anything else.

I quite like the atmostphere there with the high ceilings and nice decor. I've usually found it to be very quiet inside. The staff there are great and they always seem to be extremely happy and helpful.

I often go for their steaks, but the pork tenderlion is excellent as well.

Addendum: The same day that I posted this review, I discovered that Rosewood is now closed. How sad."}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant in Mississauga! It has great options to eat that are different from your regular chain restaurant and the patio in the summer is to die for!  They have a more than decent wine selection and the atmosphere is great for a long dinner or a relaxing lunch!"}
