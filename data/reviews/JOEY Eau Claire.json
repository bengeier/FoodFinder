{"text":"I Love the location and the food, when it's nice out the patio is a MUST... Unless you're in a rush...I live next door so I dine here frequently and I usually warn my fiends that there will be on average 3 servers and at least 15 minute gaps between being seated, asked if we want anything to drink, meal order being placed and the food finally arriving (once again, this is typically my experience on the patio).... The servers are all super nice, but once again the waiting around is painful..T.I.P.stands for \"To Insure Promptness\", sadly on the patio my tipping usually drops significantly:("}
{"text":"Great seasonal dish, was pleasantly surprised.  Atmosphere was great. Server was not the brightest, but not a big deal.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Saturday night and had my worst experience here in over 25 years. The server was incompetent to the point where she was forgetful the entire night. We finally had to waive down another server to place our food order. The apps that came was over salted. The mains were cold and not properly cooked. Drinks were never refreshed and when we asked, it took forever to come, if it did come. Calgary has too many good restaurants to put up with restaurants like this. I usually don't complain..but this was by far one of my worst experience at a Joey restaurant."}
{"text":"As Calgary's designated restaurant for the Eau Claire movie theater I was unimpressed on my last visit. I used to love Joey's for their Asian inspired dishes, which met my expectations on my last visit, but am wearier of the restaurant  after seeing the Gang Suppression Unit show up, and the search the restaurant floor, patio, and washrooms during my girl's night out on Saturday. Besides my watered down slushy Long Island, and super al dente Classic Fettuccini Alfredo, the experience was kind of scary, especially after hearing about the increase of violence in Calgary restaurants.   The waitresses service was consistent, and she was very patient with our indecisiveness, however when I went to ask her about the situation with the police  she had no clue they were even there. This might not be her fault, more so a reflection of the management and lack of communication (clearly).  PS - I think next time I'll try the Barley Mill across the street, and  I'm pretty sure kids can eat there before 9PM too."}
{"text":"I expected better , i ordered an Alfredo fetuchini with chicken and it tasted like plastic with oil, the worst Alfredo pasta i have ever had, it was not creamy at all and the pasta was hard like almost dry and raw,  the chicken only 4 small very small pieces about the size of a 25cent coin each ... very disappointing, i  ordered the  sushi prawn roll but they were out  for the moment and i had to wait 30 minutes if i wanted to order one, so i passed on that , and i was very hungry so i had to eat the whole plate of pasta and now  a my stomack  is upset since i left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Canada, I'm impressed at the quality of the \"chain\" restaurant establishments. So much better quality food & service compared to what I think would be the American comparators.  The service was good, and all the food was amazing. So glad I stumbled across Joey Eau Claire when I was in town."}
{"text":"This place is good for a casual downtown lunch, as it is centrally located and anyone who knows Calgary will know where it is.  The food is pretty good and you can count on a decent meal.  We have found that it is best to go during the off-hours or plan to be there for an early lunch or dinner. There isn't much space at the front of the restaurant to wait and it gets congested pretty easily."}
{"text":"Of all the Joey's I've been to, Joey Eau Claire's is by far the best!  Service was awesome, food was delivered promptly and was delicious!  And my dining partner said their water was great! Next time I'm in Calgary, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with a friend from out of town. She was staying at the International Hotel downtown, and normally I would go to Ki from there but my guest wasn't into sushi and not very adventurous food wise. So I chose to take her to Joey's. That's not supposed to be a dig even though it kinda came out sounding like one. It's just that I know their menu is varied enough for someone with a more exploratory palate such as mine, yet they still carry the staples that the average joe knows and likes. It was 7 on a Friday night and we only waited 10 min, with no reservation. I have to say I'd never take a date here because the waitresses may cause a problem, but I digress. I had the tuna tacos, a staple for me, and my friend had the salmon. Mine was delicious as usual but left me wanting more. They need to come with a side, no? Also a suggestion - why not try a soft shell? Less messy that way. Still delicious. Atmosphere is intimate but a touch too noisy to have any serious conversation. But if you're looking for that great place that's always pretty good, look no further."}
{"text":"I would like to note, that I have never actually sat down and ate at this location. I have however, had food brought home from this location. I have also eaten at the Joey's at Chinook mall, so I know how the food taste.   I have been to this location a couple of times when I was picking up my boyfriend who is a cook at this location. If you are ever going to Joey's at Eau Claire, make sure Ryan is working, he is an amazing chef and will always give you top notch food. He usually works appetizers and the pasta grills, so if your ordering anything from those two menus, you will get the best quality food.   The servers are all very nice there and like everyone else said, very attractive people. When I was there last, I was asked if I need help immediately, even though I was just waiting for someone, I sat at the lounge and one of the waitresses and a nice conversation with me.   I dont think you will be disappointed if you go to this Joey's. There lots to choose from, friendly staff, and quick service."}
{"text":"Love this place. Attractive wait staff, excellent food, bar, aesthetics, and service. Wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu, but this is my go to place in Calgary. Easy parking at the Eau Claire Market is an extra benefit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service!  Best butter chicken ever!!! There was a minor food issue and it was handled very professionally and to our satisfaction!! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I only come to Joey's for their burgers and I must say that their burgers have almost made me cry on occasion. I don't think I've ever had a better burger anywhere else!   I DREAM about these burgers and dedicate poems to these burgers, and my boyfriend even got me a giftcard for Joey's so I can eat these burgers.   WOOHOO I LOVE THESE BURGERS!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place when I went to Calgary for the weekend. I had ordered the rotisserie chicken with the ribs and it tasted amazing!! service was quick and efficient. The restaurant itself is nice, dark and trendy. My friend and I had to wait 20 mins for our seats because we arrived during rush hour but was offered some wine which was nice."}
{"text":"I am hard to satisfy when it comes to eating at a restaurant or lounge. I should say Joey Eau Claire or what we were used to call Joey Tomato, is not my type of place. I would tell you why, in a second. I should begin with telling i love the food here; from the butter chicken to sandwiches mushroom soup. BUT, you can easily feel the ATTITUDE here. And I am pretty sure it is somehow supported by the management. I can easily feel the different look they have on non-whites here. Last time i was there, they embarrassed me in front of my mother until she told me in the middle of food \"that's enough; let's leave\"!  Even though some of the waitresses here are very nice people you can easily feel they are not involved with your experience there and do their job with the less care possible. I am not sure if I ever go there again. You better find a more pleasant place to go..."}
{"text":"I've been to almost all JOEY restaurants around Edmonton, so when we were in Calgary for a few days, we thought we'd have dinner there thinking they were all the same. I'm not sure why, but the food quality was sub-par. I ordered the chicken Tagliatelle, and it looked like it was heated in a microwave. One big dry lump of pasta stuck together. The staff reflected the food, too."}
{"text":"Joey's used to be fairly standard Italian chain restaurant fare.  It was pretty good for what it was.  Sadly Joey's has decided to move into \"fusion\" and in my one recent visit, it didn't work well.  The food took forever and arrived cold, the service was slow and forgetful and the meal was relatively expensive.  If you're looking for this type of restaurant, Earl's is much better."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The worse service and food I've ever had. So my experience at Joey's has always been terrible. I went to the one in Vancouver and ended up with broken glass in my friend's drink. The waitress didn't comp her a drink just replaced it with another...seriously? So than I went to the one in Chinook Centre in Calgary - the experience was pretty good. than i went to the one in Eau Claire. Well we went on a sunday and wanted a patio seat - two hostess were present and told us there was no room and if we would like the bar area while we wait. We agreed. Well our server didnt come until 10 minutes later asked us for our drinks. I ordered a mojita - well it came late and it was disgusting. So I had to flag her down for another type of drink...our servier didn't bother to ask what was wrong with the mojita. We ordered the apple sauce and cracker/cheese platter (they no longer have it on the menu)...well the crostini's were not toasted and were soggy and the apple sauce which is supposed to be warm was frozen. I told the server she rolled her eyes and was having a hard time trying to punch it into the system...i waited...and waited and finally got up and told her that I was hungry that not to bother with the reordering and I'll just eat the soggy crostini and the frozen apple sauce. To make matters worse she was so taken aback that she ignored our table for the rest of the evening. I had to harass her to get our bill. The end it off - we waited at the bar for our patio seat and the hostesses had forgotten about us - I nofitifed our waitress on the bar side and she replied that we were next in line?? Really? We were told 20 mins and we were already into our meal an hour and half later... I went to the ladies bathroom before we left...and guess what? No paper towel to dry off my hands. One of the two blank faced hostesses could have checked on that and I was literraly pissed off. I went back there again two months later and still shitty service and bad chain food. I give 5 thumbs down to this place."}
{"text":"I like this Joeys. Sure the ladies are forced to dress like call girls. And that really could be improved on (clearly I'm not a man).  That said the service and food are consistently great. Fun cocktails. Good wine. Healthy meals. Sinfully indulgent foods. It's good for a drink and a snack, a meal with friends or a romantical occasion. I've done all of the above with success. Have tried a variety of menu items and have never been disappointed, from the salads to the steaks to the burgers.  Location is good too. Close to hotels, downtown. Path system. Parking isn't easy but there are options."}
{"text":"Came here first for dinner then twice for lunch. Great food ordered apps fried cauliflower-a bit too spicy & gyoza- simply delicious. Service was ok not great. Service for lunch is really slow when the patio is open. I'm giving 3 stars for the food as it is always good, not as impressed with the service."}
{"text":"I used to come here years ago when it was Joey Tomato.  Other than the name, it's, pretty much, as I remember it.  Awesome!  Personal service with a smile.  Canadian hospitality at its best.  This time I had the ahi tacos and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Kelsey was our waitress last night on the patio and she made sure we had such a great experience. She was so personable! The table of the 3 of us are all new hires, recently moved to Canada and working in Eau Claire. Due to our experience with Kelsey we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Worst service I think I have ever had!!!  Took forever to even get drinks for our table of 8.  She would bring one drink at a time...never using a tray.  Ridiculous....  I'll give it two stars as the food was pretty good...but cold cause the waitress was terrible and left it on the kitchen counter forever.  When we did get food, we got 2 or 3 dishes and others waited another 20-30 mins!  Used to go here a fair bit with customers etc as I work near by.  Not going any time soon...that's for sure..."}
{"text":"Was in town giving a speech and decided to stop by here.  Very cozy atmosphere.  Extremely friendly staff.  The Waitstaff frequently stopped by our table and hung out with us.  Very friendly.  Yes, the place has some selective hiring policies.    Food:  Sliders - Very good.  Hot.  Hit the spot.  5/5 Tuna Tacos - high grade chunk of tuna with some flavor.  4/5 Chili Chicken - crispy, crunchy, spicy, and unique - This was my favorite app. 5/5  CAB Sirloin - Very soft, very tender, and cooked as ordered.  I like Calgary beef, but nothing beats Texas Ribeyes.  Sorry. 4/5  Overall, this place was trendy and relaxed.  I like the selection and the friendly folks."}
{"text":"We came in during the last weekend of the Stampede and this restaurant was right across from our hotel so we popped in for dinner. The place was packed but we managed to be seated with minimal wait time. The food service was extremely slow due to the volume they were experiencing due to the Stampede no doubt. The Moroccan soup was really great. Super flavourful. The sirloin I had was good as well. It did take about an hour and a half for our food to arrive though which is an extremely long bill time for a restaurant such as this, big event or not. The servers were good although we barely saw ours. Food runners brought us our food. Our soups arrived without spoons and we lacked in drink refills throughout our dining experience; just little things like that. It was conveniently located though in the Eau Clair market which is a nice little walk about after dinner."}
{"text":"1st time in Canada and was brought here for dinner.    I walked in and loved the vibe here.  Wonderful, friendly staff!  Because it was my 1st time here, I received a complimentary appetizer- Ahi tuna tacos.....  Now, I think my bro-in-law makes kick ass fish tacos with his asian inspired slaw that it gives the california baja fish taco a run for it's money, but these mini Ahi fish tacos were the bomb and ranks right up next to my bro-in-law's tacos.  For my dinner entree, I thouroughly enjoyed the blackened basa- which was highly recommended - with a merlot...delicious.  Made a whole day of travel to Canada end on a great note.  Totally relaxing...."}
{"text":"This particular location of Joey Tomato's probably marks my favourite Joey's location in Calgary. Let me breakdown the reasons why:  #1. It's in a prime location so once you're done eating, there's a slew of things to do. You can go see a flick, you can go for a walk along the river, you can go out dancing, you can head over to a local pub, you can hit the gym (yeah...RIGHT!), you can have ice cream/dessert in the area, and the list goes on and on. Everything is walking distance from this Joey's and you can literally have an entire evening out without even having to move your car once.  #2. The serving staff seems a little less pretentious than at other Joey Tomato's locations. Come on, I know you know what I mean. It's already hard enough to eat with all the eye candy walking around, but it's nice when they can actually break a smile or joke around with you.   #3. The restaurant brings in a really great crowd over the weekend. Everyone's dressed up for a night on the town and whether you're there on a first date, or a last date, everyone seems to be havin' a relatively good time.  I especially love the Chinatown lettuce wraps and the fries. Not necessarily in that order. And let's not overlook their Molten Lava Chocolate Souffle!  Prices are reasonable enough and the atmosphere is enticing, attractive & fun.  I'll definitely be heading back...See y'all there."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed Joey Tomatoes. And never been disappointed with the service. They have great food at reasonable prices plus today I had a sampling of baileys with coffee when I came in which was nice and warning in this cold weather. We also had a sampling of apple pie with a dollop of ice cream after which was just the right finish to their great house salad and a salmon entree."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends and a new bunch to this bar/restaurant on a Saturday evening. Food was great, nice variety of drinks. This is not a quiet spot and can get a little loud, but that was fine. All was good apart from one male waiter who was too cool for school. Got him a shooter of tequila, hopefully he'll feel better for next time and just get on with serving rather than \"always having somewhere more important to be\""}
{"text":"I had the herb salmon.  Delicious.  And they crispy mashed potato was unique and delicious.   The service was great."}
{"text":"The environment is classy and nice. However, the place is super warm over the winter. Dress light! Lol   Their sushi cone is delicious, I'd highly recommend it.  I had their two sushi rolls. The Osaka Style Pressed Salmon Sushi was horrible, I do not recommend it.   The rainbow roll was good but nothing special.   The staff was friendly. Overall, I'd again but I'd try something else."}
{"text":"Just like the other reviewers said: delicious food, but horrible service.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken with dirty rice and it was phenomenal. The service though, sucked bawlz. I was there with my bf and his uncle, and the damn waitress kept looking at my bf the entire time she was talking to us. Never mind when she's taking my orders, she glances at me for a split second, and smiles at my bf for 5 minutes. Come on now, can we be less obvious here? \"Anything to DRINK?\" she screeched, looking straight at my bf who was already drinking Coke but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed she was talking to ALL of us, since I had NOT YET ordered anything. On top of all these shenanigans, when I harmlessly commented that the carrot in my bf's salad tasted pickled, she tries to make a quasi-joke calling me a \"CRAZY GIRL!!!\". Ummm I'm pretty sure that to be making jokes with me you have to have first built some rapport with me, no? Very annoying.  In conclusion, if you're a dude, go there. Food is great, and the waitresses will practically give you a lap dance. If you're a girl, you can still go and enjoy the food, but be prepared for all kinds of stupidity."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Waited for 15 minutes to get service. Server forgot the drinks. Good thing the staff are good looking cause that's all this place has going for it."}
{"text":"It's good for week day lunches though the waiting can be a bit long if you are in a rush.  Menu is fairly good with some Asian options and the fish is fresh. Definitely a good option if you want to escape the boring food court downtown lunch."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was delicious. Lots of flavor. Veggie Pasta, fish tacos, burgers, steak - everything was great. The service was also five star. Adequately paced and very polite."}
{"text":"This place is okay. The table we got seated at that had salt (or sugar) all over it was okay. The service was okay.  Props to their site design for their menu *not* being a .pdf file. The simple green salad was delicious and filling, loaded with almonds and craisins. My brother asked for eleventy billion changes to his Viva Salad and actually got everything he ordered. I like that Joey's has quite a few vegetarian and vegan options.   No corkage at this place, so don't bring your own wine bottle like we did ;)."}
{"text":"Even the chicken breast was full and tender.  The rest was not bad either.  The place was VERY crowded even early in the evening, but considering that it is a bar, the food was very good.  I had the Bombay Butter Chicken.  The service was good and friendly, and... well, not hard to look at.  I ordered the Bombay Butter Chicken, and the presentation was excellent.  The food came out with a little formed ball of rice covered with pistachio and some other things.  There was even some Nan.  The sauce was good, as was the chicken.  Don't eat at the Sheraton if you're staying there, just walk across the street, it's a far better option, better food, better...umm environment...  If your wife wants to finish that book, just tell her she can stay in the room, and you'll go to dinner alone ;) ;), otherwise you may get smacked.  I think I'd give it 5 stars for atmosphere, and 4 for food."}
{"text":"Standard fare. Standard service. So I'm giving a standard review. Nothing stands out here at Joey's to make it special. It's pretty average. But they do make a wicked Belini. I could suck back a few of those and not care what I'm eating. In my last visit here, my friend and I came out for lunch. I had the lobster grilled cheese which I've had before. It was pretty good but I actually liked the house salad better. I should have gone with my original choice of the lettuce wraps which are to die for.   Joey's no longer takes reservations which sucks. If you want a table at lunch, you have to be there before 11:30am, especially in the summer and want to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"We went out for girl's night for a birthday - there were 4 of us on a Friday night. I arrived at around 730pm and while I sat on the bench at the front waiting for my friends, I was given a couple of sips worth of red wine in a nice glass while I waited! I assume this was a manager - nice touch!  As I waited I took in the space and learned a bit about the restaurant. I had not been before and had heard mixed reviews on it. I found the atmosphere to be busy, vibrant, electric. The lounge to the left of the entrance of course was noisy and was later told that it could get a little out of hand (fights) so I would advise people to leave the kids at home if you choose to come here, on weekend nights anyways. The space was beautiful. High wooden beams, dimly lit, open kitchen, the staff seemed professional (OMG, I do not know how these gals wear 4 inch heels all night but they all looked sharp).  Middle of the road type place between casual and fancy. This restaurant does not take reservations so when my friends arrived, I was thrilled that we got a large table for 6. Lots of room for our jackets, purses... There is also a bar you can sit at in the restaurant if the lounge is not for you. I have only been to a couple of Joey's in my lifetime and I do adore the menu choices. It took all of us a long time to choose as we were lovin' on our drinks. I went with the Ahi Tuna Salad and other than the missing mango which was later rectified, I was really happy with it. One of the reasons I ordered the salad was for the mango and all the waitress could say is that the kitchen staff are very \"stingy\" with the mango..? Huh? But when I got it, the chunks were sooo good in the salad. I should not have had to ask for it though... My friends got Caesar salads, ribs, chicken, steak, salmon and everyone was happy with their meals. The spring rolls that hold the loaded baked potatoes were genius and beyond delicious. The lava cake for the b-day girl was not available (server said day staff had overcooked them all) but we got these little donut things with lemon curd on a plate that were the bomb. Nothing free here for birthdays. The Washington Riesling - order this if you love white wine! Service was good, not excellent (maybe her attitude could have been a tad better but bad days happen and it was busy) but we never wanted for anything. Drinks were refilled as were our water glasses. The waitress did split the bill for us and without cracking a smile, POOF she was off and running never to be seen again.  I would certainly come back here with friends. For date night I may choose somewhere different but coming from the NW of the city on a freezing cold, snowy night, I was not disappointed with my friend's choice to come downtown. We had an absolute blast!"}
{"text":"What's not to like? Great service great food. Awesome house salad and chicken souvlaki was excellent. Maybe a little thick on the pita. Yam fries were awesome.   Servers had a great attitude and very friendly. Glad I tried this place"}
{"text":"Great Food, Disinterested wait staff.  I always make a point of going to Joey Eau Claire whenever I'm in Calgary on business.  The food is consistently great.  I had the Spiced Basa followed by the Apple Pie and my coworker had the lobster revioli with the chocolate souffle to finish.  Again - great food.  Well prepared, well cooked.  I hope the chef is well compensated.  On the downside this was the first time we got poor service there.  We were there for 15 min before our server came to take our beverage order.  She didn't really come by to ask how the meal was or chat with us.  Normally the friendly staff is the hallmark of Joey.  She didn't want to really chat until she brought the credit card machine.  I still believe in tipping based on service.  In this case my tip reflected it.  I'll likely show up on one of those poor tipper websites."}
{"text":"The menu here covers enough bases that it is a good spot for the office group. Even the pickiest can find something to eat. Quality is middle of the road as are the prices. I give 4.5 stars for the attractive young ladies that they hire as servers. Come to think of it both the Metropolitan and the Earls on Stephen follow the same formula. I can live with it. Happy to see that both Earls and Joeys are in Ontario now."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid place for a lunch meeting. The management seem to have the place running like a well oiled machine.  Consistent service and food comes out quickly. Unfortunately, the food, while good, is nothing to write home about. The beer menu seems to have shrunk a bit and the prices are starting to tip the scales. But you can't go wrong for a business lunch.  Great patio, too."}
{"text":"This is actually a 3.5, but that is a minor detail. Joey's is like Earl's is like Moxie's etc etc. Decent food, for a decent price. I tend to go here to meet my old work crew for drinks on Friday.   They have lots of yummy drinks, most are way too sweet for my taste, but none the less, there is always wine. I had a good salad, typical, goat cheese, strawberries, candied nut sort of thing.   I don't have a lot to say, as noted, it's good, does the trick, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"This place is right across from our hotel so decided to try for our last night in Calgary. It was busy but were seated right away. The hostess took our drink order then shortly after the waitress (Taya)came by. Her service was impeccable and always on top of everything. We ordered fried calamari (4/5) as an appetizer, slider (5/5) for our picky eater son, steak & sushi (4/5) and Salmon rice bowl (5/5). Steak part of steak & sushi was submerged in citrus ponzu sauce with ginger & scallion. Sushi that came with it was really good, it had salmon on top with tempura crunchy on top and more salmon in the middle. This dish would have made 5/5 if it came with wasabi on the side and steak was a bit more tender. Overall I would recommend it. Wife ordered salmon bowl, it was so good that I have to steal some vegetables from her plate. Taya' service was nothing but excellent.  Happy hour, I believe, is until 6pm daily. Not a big section but try their happy hour beer, it's really good for $4"}
{"text":"Great vibe, excellent menu, wonderful service and delicious food - all in the perfect location (right by the waterfront) in Calgary. From the outside, it does not look big but once you enter, it is airy and spacious, with plenty of seating. We opted for a high top in the bar area. We had time to kill and our waitress was delightful and made us feel just fine ordering at our own pace. The shrimp pesto flatbread started it off and was wonderful. The mixed greens salad was another winner. I had the house specialty chicken (with ribs) and it was fall off the bone yummy.  Ample parking in the lot right behind it."}
{"text":"Joey has the best rotisserie chicken I have ever eaten. I would not go there for a steak or even try their Asian cuisine. There are better places in Calgary for that.   The service was amazing. The waitress was cute and so was the hostess. Don't expect hooters-style waitresses though, joey's ones are smart AND good looking(especially dressed as cowgirls)   The chicken: never had anything that amazing in my life. It was moist, soft and melts in your mouth. I savored every bite of it, feeling the spices mix up into an explosion of taste that blew my mind. I'm not a big fan of chicken breast because i find it gets boring, not joey's though. The breasts and the legs were delicious. Oh yeah...  Fries: perfectly cooked, dry enough, well salted and tasty.   Coleslaw: not a huge salad fan but it went down pretty well.   Definitely worth trying if you are in Calgary."}
{"text":"I was at Joey Tomatoes' in summer of 2005 and had the very best Ribeye steak that I have ever had.  I still tell my friends in California about that steak!  It was great!"}
{"text":"Went here last week with my kids, had a wonderful meal! Can't remember the name of our waitress but she was very sweet and attentive. Will be back again!   Parking was a little tricky due to location, but we are downtown! LOL"}
{"text":"Good food. Most recently the Bombay Butter Chicken, which could have come from an Indian restaurant, it was that good. Unexpected from a chain restaurant with more North American / pasta choices. Prices were reasonable for the food. Beer was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Joey's is pretty similar to Earls or Moxie's. Good food, consistent across theIr locations, always busy. I personally find the service to be spotty - and this is a consistent trend across all locations - predominantly catered to guys. The downtown location is especially packed for lunch and after-work drinks. Try starting your lunch break at 11am if you actually want to get a table. I find they're inconsistent on whether or not they actually take reservations."}
{"text":"We came here because we stayed Across the street after flying in from America. We like to eat GOOD FOOD that is super flavorful and delicious when on vacation and we are SO happy we went here. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. Come here if you're in the area - you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Nothing  has changed in years.  Food is fine staff is as expected but there are many better options within 5 blocks for better food quality and certainly better drink selection.  And plastic cups make you feel like you are camping.  If I want that feel I'll get it at home for much better price."}
{"text":"Great place, clean, modern, unbelievable staff, lots of good \"scenery\", Tv's at the bar, lots of outdoor seating, huge bar area"}
{"text":"Our Team had to work one Saturday, but there was still time for a leisurely late Lunch on the Patio at Joey's. It was a warm Indian Summer day and who knows how long it would be until the weather would \"Fall Off the Cliff\"? Service was friendly and attentive, the Lunch conversation was stimulating, and my Lobster Grill Cheese sandwich was delicious. Life is Good!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a couple of friends. The app we wanted was not available.  My steak came ($33) over cooked, was sent back and the new steak was very good. A young management team, could have been a lot tighter. The resto manager should never be seen sitting at a bar seat.  Ever."}
{"text":"Where in Calgary, Alberta can you go for Bombay butter chicken, panang prawn bowl, ravioli with lobster / grilled prawns, bbq salmon rice bowl,  Spanish paella, baby back ribs, and filet mignon?    Last night in Canada on our 9 day Canadian Rockies trip.  We walk into Joey Eau Claire, brick building, with large windows, and outdoor patio on this hot summer night in early September. TV screens above a huge bar area, with waitresses in short one piece black skirt outfits.  We get an indoors table, take a look at the early bird specials, including $4 Hawaiian tuna taco, sushi cone, and sliders royale, good 3-6pm everyday, or after 9pm Sunday-Thursday.  6:30pm, we are out of luck.  Our waitress wears the shortest skirt of all the ladies, and gives us the menus.  Wife orders the $24.25 CAD ravioli with lobster and grilled prawns, while I get the $19.25 CAD Bombay butter chicken.  Service is leisurely.  We are one of the few who do not order any drinks or beer.  I do some people looking, and check out a guy in shorts and white slide sandals, and a lady in a skin clinging pair of jeans, displaying her good proportions.  If you got it flaunt it!  The Bombay butter chicken is as good as those in Silicon Valley, home to thousands of Indian engineers.  Boneless chicken with just the amount of spice in a bowl of thick gravy, accompanied by rice with peas, and home made hot out of the oven naan.    The ravioli with lobster comes with three prawns, in a thick butter sauce.  Lobster clearly can be seen when cutting open one of the ravioli.    Both of us finish our meals in very quick time, and still hungry, order the $9.25 CAD apple crisp a la mode, with maple ice cream.    Average service, noisy atmosphere, excellent food, small portions.  Only time I had a chance to eat Indian food on our 9 day trip.    I give the waitress an extra dollar or two for showing me her revealing short skirt outfit!"}
{"text":"OK I don't usually like going to \"chain\" restaurants but I have to admit the food here is reeeeeally good. We tried the calamari and sushi cones to start and they were both fantastic. Some of the best calamari I've ever had with a tasty batter and dipping sauce. I ordered the Katsu Chicken Peanut Salad and was surprised to find that the salad was topped on a large piece of chicken. Very different! You have to cut the chicken piece with a knife and fork as you eat the salad. The miso ginger dressing on it was the best part so tasty and went really well with the thinly sliced fresh veggies."}
{"text":"I really like the mood of this place. It is located right in the hustle and bustle that is Eau Claire. As a result, it felt lively.  It was seat yourself and really laid back.  I ordered the house salad and added chargrilled shrimp. It was such a fresh salad. So I decided to order the Apple crisps as a dessert because of course dessert pairs really well with salad!  What I loved most was the maple ice cream that came with my dessert.   Overall this was a really good meal."}
{"text":"Waiter and host were nice. We asked what was good on the menu and all he mentioned was the most expensive dish.. which we didn't end up getting. There was a bit of a mix up with the runner bringing us the wrong order and they never refilled our water. The food was really good but it's a pricey place and we didn't even get drinks."}
{"text":"I gave this place a pretty bad review the last time I was reviewing because the service was sooo unacceptably terrible. I ended up getting a half assed message from a manager there about coming in for a another go. I called back several times to follow up on that and got no where. Le sigh.  None the less, I do happen to still go to Joey's at least once a week (if not many more times) simply because they are close to my office. I have to say, their menu has come a long way. They have some uber delicious dishes that satisfy my health-conscious needs, which makes me very happy. Their fries are unreal, their lettuce wraps are amazing, the salad list is so creative, and let me tell you about their drinks: 10/10! Best in the city in my opinion! They've really done their homework on what makes a really fun cocktail. I always just say \"surprise me\" and am never disapointed! Colorful, fruity, alcoholic (key!), amazing. This is really why I keep going back. My favorite drink: Raspberry/Blueberry Super Nova Voda Soda. Yummm.  The reason I'm giving them a 4 star is because unfortuntely the service still blows. However, I did have an amazing server for the first time when I was unsuspectinly there on Saturday enjoying their patio. Maybe that's the trick, come on the weekends to get good service. Typically i'm there for the week day lunch rush and it's a painful process. First of all, they don't take reservations which drives me insane. Second, you have to be there by 11:15 if you want a table, another thing that drives me crazy. But I guess why should they care since clearly they are full. Anyways, we get there at 11:15, and the servers just seem to be so overwhelmed that it even stresses me out!!  None the less, their food and drinks keep me coming back!!"}
{"text":"For what this place represents itself to be, it's really good. This is a casual spot with a large bar area, friendly staff, and a basic menu. The wine list is as expected for a sports bar/restaurant, and the food was slightly better than expected. It's not a destination restaurant, but just a nice place to hang out and have a fun, reliable meal."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and thoroughly enjoyed each one, until my past visit. My friend and I went for a drink on their patio after walking thorough downtown. We were seated by the hostess and a waitress followed soon after, she was friendly and took our drinks. We waited patiently for 15 minutes with still no drinks. No one walked by us or asked if we had been helped. We turned, watched the bartender walk around ask people how their night was, tables were tended to multiple time. We final tried to flag a waitress who has just finished collecting a tables bill who then ignored us for 5 more minutes while talking. When we finally left she was shocked we were leaving. This place has an excellent atmosphere but the lack of tentativeness to the customer probes the lack of experience and training of the staff.   Highly doubt I will be returning intentionally."}
{"text":"We had a top notch business lunch here largely due to the fact that the serving staff was outstanding. Aside from the fact that it looks like they hired everyone on staff from a modelling agency, our hostess and server were engaging, relatable and interesting people. The food was stellar. I had the ribs and a calamari to start and although this restaurant is tucked somewhat out of the way from centre ice, I would recommend it to anyone. Really good experience."}
{"text":"Somewhat like a Yardhouse in Canada but slightly more mom and pop feel. Great selection of beers (Kokanee and Big Rock were my favorites) and I'd highly recommend their desserts. Either their hand made apple tart or their lava cake are amazing. Both were done very well. Lots of variety. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Ah, Joey Tomato's.  This is one of those restaurants that you can suggest to me and I'll never say no.  Their menu is broad enough that they can usually satisfy whatever craving I have.  With a few locations in Calgary, this one is definitely my favourite.  The location is excellent, the service has always been great, the food is fantastic, and yes, I won't complain about the eye candy.  Let's talk more about the location.  Being in Eau Claire, Joey Tomato's is a great choice for lunch during the week, dinner after work, dinner before a movie, or to start out a night of debauchery in the core.  Be forewarned though, you will have to pay for parking.  If you want to park anywhere close to the restaurant, you will have to pay no matter what time or day it is.  But there are some free-after-6 parking choices available not too far away.  You've probably heard about the service, and perhaps more obviously, the eye candy.  Yes, Joey Tomato's hires great-looking people almost exclusively.  Ethics aside, if you like looking at beautiful people, Joey's is a good choice.  But more importantly, the service has always been great too.  So along with good looks, they also try and hire people who know what they are doing.  Joey's always hits a home run for food with me.  I consider myself very lucky in that they have never screwed up my order or brought me food that didn't taste exactly as it should.  The variety is also good enough to satisfy most groups, which is important if you hang out with selective eaters.  Unless you have lots of confidence, don't bring a date here in the early stages of a relationship.  The same goes if you have wandering eyes, or lack the ability to avoid getting caught.  Because trust me, your eyes will wander."}
{"text":"This Joey Tomato's always makes me suspicious. The staff are all very attractive, and seeing that many beautiful people in one place sans dance music and/or club wear puts me on guard. Why so much eye candy? What if it distracts me from my food?   None of my male friends share this suspicion, and so I've eaten here a few times: after work (downtown convenience!) or before a movie and/or festival. I would not choose it for a date location, however. If you've read my previous reviews, then you know I notice the cute guys, and I hate it when the situation is reversed. I think it's bad date-news all around to have such distracting servers, post-dinner romantic walks by the river or not.  The food is firmly in decent, contemporary, Earls-style food. Some pastas, some steaks, a bit of effort to make it gourmet and out of the ordinary but not enough to turn off picky eaters. It's a good place for a business lunch because of that. The atmosphere is a little sexy, but not too much. It's not bad a bad place at all, just shiny on the surface and a little bland underneath."}
{"text":"Great location and good menu variety.  Had special dietary request and server was more than happy to accommodate.  Typically the word 'service' is lacking in Calgary when it comes to hospitality service.  Room was loud, high ceilings, good menu, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Here are a few reasons why we enjoy going to this place:  - Nicely Located in Eau Claire - The Food will not disappoint you. - The Lettuce wraps are yummy. all of them. - The servers are quite good looking. all of them :-)"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Joey's elsewhere in the city, but this location impressed. Nice ambiance (inside and out), decent (though not great) service, and an impressively varied menu. I liked my blackened basa, and others I was with likewise liked their entrees, all of which looked good."}
{"text":"Was there on Canada Day evening with a group of six.  It was busy when we arrived (7pm), but quickly started emptying out.  Drink orders took about 15 minutes, and then it took another 30 minutes for the waitress to take our food order.  Worst, though, was the wait for food - it took 90 minutes from the time we ordered food for it to arrive!!  We certainly weren't the only ones in the restaurant having this experience - many nearby tables were similar.  On the plus side, food was good and the patio is beautiful (retractable roof for a flash rain storm!).  But, with this kind of wait for food, I wouldn't return unless I was not hungry."}
{"text":"So I usually get the ahi tuna club but this time under friend's influence I got the The Butcher's Sandwich. Vancouver doesn't have The Butcher's Sandwich on the menu. But the Calgary location doesn't have the ahi tuna taco.  Oh well. The Butcher's Sandwich has lots of Roast Beef. They were very generous on the meet. Nice. Only issue was that its not a lot of flavor.   I liked location. Its located inside the trendy location of Eau Claire market. The décor of the place is really trendy. I like the atmosphere. Service was not bad.   Overall experience was good. Food was good."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening with my cousin at JOEY Eau Claire.  We both ordered the Rotisserie Chicken (mine was minus the veggies) ... it's the only thing I get when I go to a JOEY's.  As always, it was delicious and filling!  Sofia was our server.  She was friendly and chatty yet she left us alone so we could catch up (we hadn't seen each other in 40 years!)."}
{"text":"Service was incredible!  They have a menu specific for gluten free or vegan which made it super easy to choose what to eat.  The server was very well informed on all ingredients that could contain allergens and would advise accordingly.   The food that all of us ordered was delicious, cooked to order and hit the spot.  I would highly recommend and their prices are very reasonable for the service."}
{"text":"Yummy steak! The mashed potatoes were in spring roll wrappers! The veggies were so good I ordered more. Staff was cheerful and I had pleasant conversation with the hostess The laitte was a nice finish., no room for dessert:) I like this place and will come again."}
{"text":"Step-kid dinner choice.   I'm not a huge fan of fast food - not even the \"fancy\" kind...so Joey is not my 1st 2nd or 3rd choice. HOWEVER, this location is nice enough, service is good and they have a lot of options if you have a restricted diet.   DH always gets chilli chicken, but this last time he had the lobster grilled cheese. Said that it was good. Filling though, and a bit greasy. Left him with a bit of a stomach ache.   Beer - good and cold.   I had the new menu item - Kale salad with soy protein and dressing on the side. Filling and feels like you're not eating garbage.   Vegan Gin Caesar - spicy - done well and garnished with a spicy pickled bean.   Kidlets - had the chilli chicken and ate most/all of it. They offer chocolate milk here - which I cannot stand feeding to anyone however, i'm the step-parent...ugh. There is also apple juice - not that the sugar in concentrated AJ is any good for you.   We spend at least 1 weds evening a month here - maybe every 2 months for an afternoon visit. Big booths make it great for getting homework done - big kid homework too.   Close to Eau Claire play area for kids before or after a meal.   Fairly priced as well so you're not going broke eating fancy fast food."}
{"text":"Can bank on not having to turn down anything here. Great atmosphere, good selection on the menu and they have something for everyone. tacos are good, so is the seared tuna. the lettuce wraps are great.. good place to go if you dont know what you wanna do."}
{"text":"almost 3.5  Regular Joey place. Could have been 4 if the food was served warmer... I don't know if this is the waitress who was too slow or the cooks... Ribs are OK. Lobster ravioli are really good (could be better if served warmer and not dried on top...)"}
{"text":"Good service, good location and the food is good as well... The ambience is really nice!!  ... The wine was unimpressive... Maybe is a place for beers or cocktails, but if you are a wine person this is not the best place to try good wine... I would probably go back for cocktails as I had a very good time on the patio there!!"}
{"text":"I actually liked this place. The restaurant was right beside my hotel when I was in the city for business so I gave it a try. I met up with a friend who works nearby and comes here all the time for lunch so I knew it would be decent.   The patio was really nice with long tables and understated, tasteful flowers. It was really busy and there were lots of young professionals which gave it a more lively and fun atmosphere.   I had the ahi tuna salad which was delicious. The salad was exactly what I wanted, lots of fresh greens, avocados, bell peppers and perfectly seared rare tuna. I really enjoyed it and would definitely order it again.   My friend had the steak and sushi which she said was really good. For dessert I had the chocolate lava cake which was amazing! I've had too many bad chocolate lava cakes and this was not one of them. It was rich and smooth and very hot which I liked.   Our server was lovely and helpful and the whole experience was very enjoyable. Great place for dinner or just a few drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"I absolutely love JOEY.  I first came here a couple months ago, and I absolutely loved it.  Steak and sushi.  Can't go wrong.  I came back again a few days ago for a nice dinner, and it hasn't changed.  Excellent food and service in a trendy location by the Bow.  They've got an excellent outdoor patio for gorgeous summer Calgary days, and a nice lounge/bar area as well if you prefer indoor seating.  This time around, I asked for some recommendations.  I was heavily tempted to just go with what I know - the steak and sushi, but the paella seemed to be calling out to me.  I hadn't had paella before, so I thought now would be a good chance to try.  I realize it's probably a very non-traditional one, but I went for it all the same.    No regrets.  Great combinations of fresh flavors, colors, and textures.  Toasted/burnt rice at the bottom of the pan mixed with silky glutinous rice.  Large shrimp and small shrimp mixed with the rice provided sweetness contrasted nicely with chorizo.  Fresh peas added nice color, and the tomatoes, cilantro, and lemon added a great bright acidity, sweetness.  All in all, a very well put together, enjoyable dish.  I think I need to come back here again real soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with good atmosphere and vibe.  No kids menu, and the food mostly doesn't fit kids.  The steak & sushi and the lobster sandwich were very good.  Fish tacos were ok, the spicy sauce was very good.  Good service but can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"To sum it up, awesome food, a bit overpriced, nice ambiance (not for a first date).  If you want healthy, get the Beach Salad, for seafood try the Lobster Ravioli and for fun try the Lobster Sandwich.  Portions are decent....not as large as Cheesecake factory (although the salads come fairly close).  All in all, a nice sit down with friends or family.  Bon apetite!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my 1.5 year old son and our friends with their kid.  They were pretty accommodating to our party, and were patient when our kid was being whiny.  The food here is nothing phenomenal, but they do have some great happy hour deals.   They didn't have enough high chairs to let both kids sit in them, so I had to eat my meal while wrangling my toddler, but otherwise the experience was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend for my birthday lunch. Always greeted friendly here....seated right away.  Asked about Vegan options and although they were out of the Handmade Veg burger I was told that they have Soy Chicken which can be substituted into any of the entrees!! My friend ordered that with her lettuce wraps..I had a taste...DEELISH!  I had the 500 Salad....very tasty and I was not hungry when I left!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was delicious. Dessert was heavenly.  I had the sushi and steak dinner option with a side of seasonal veggies. The seasonal veggies were mostly zucchini with three lost pieces of sauteed onions and four small pieces of red bell peppers. I was a bit disappointed by the seasonal veggies because the zucchini tasted a bit off and there was no squash. The only saving grace were the mushrooms, which, as should be expected, were delightful.  I was a bit wary of how a restaurant with such an eclectic menu could be good, but they did it! The sushi was great and the steak was nice and juicy.   Apparently the Bombay and the Morroccan Chicken are even better than what I had, which makes me want to go back tomorrow and Wednesday to have them again.   Now, on to the desserts... The ice creams that come with the desserts really make the desserts stand out. The molten lava chocolate dessert is okay. The ice cream and raspberries it comes with is the best part about it. The apple pie comes with a nice heap of maple ice cream on top and when you take a spoonful of apple pie, and get a bit of that maple ice cream on your spoon too, you will have this dual flavor explosion in your mouth that will just be amazing. To get that same depth of flavor with the molten lava cake, you have to get a bit of the \"lava\" on your spoon, take a bit of the vanilla ice cream, and put a raspberry on top of your spoon and put that in your mouth. I promise you, there is no other better way to eat that dessert."}
