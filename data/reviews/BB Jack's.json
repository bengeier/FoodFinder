{"text":"I decided to give BBJ's another try and brought a friend for a Friday lunch catch-up session. Other than a couple of people sitting at the bar, we were the first people in the restaurant. When we left, the restaurant still didn't strike me as particularly busy. My friend and I both ordered fish tacos, which were one of the specials of the day. I requested a side salad rather than the chips and salsa: yes, I'm one of those pesky substitution-requesting people (my request was accommodated without hesitation or irritation). The salad looked appetizing, but since it was delivered without any silverware, I set it to the side and ended up taking it home (we asked for silverware when our entrees arrived, which was the next time that we saw a restaurant employee nearby). As a side note, I'm not sure whether the person who brought our entrees and silverware, and who then kindly boxed up my salad for me and brought the bill was the owner or manager, but he was far more helpful and friendly than our waitress, who never even refilled our water glasses (though she did check in to see that our food had arrived okay). 

The fish tacos were disappointing, to say the least. The fish itself had been fried in a crispy but flavorless batter. The majority of the real estate on the three flour tortillas, though, was occupied by lettuce, tomatoes, and a few strands of cheese. Lemon wedges rounded out the plate. (The fact that the dish was intended to be served with chips and salsa is duly noted.) Although we both attacked the fish with a salt shaker and our lemons, the dish was still very one-note. It really needed bite from onions, jalapenos--anything to make it not...well, BLAND. As it was, we ended up putting tartar sauce on our tacos. Yes, really. 

On the up-side, the meal was quite reasonably priced: in fact, I don't believe BBJ's charged me for the substitution, which I fully expected them to do. But, in the final analysis, it took me over 2 years to try BBJ's again after my initial visit. After being completely underwhelmed again, I feel very confident in saying that I won't be making further attempts to enjoy a place that seems like it should be a local gem, but comes up short."}
{"text":"I have been to BB Jacks in northern Wisconsin and they have great pizza so I thought I would try BB Jacks in De Forest. Nice restaurant in De Forest and the staff was helpful. We went for lunch so I tried the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and it was very good. More of a bar / restaurant with a back dining area that you can also use for private parties. I will definitely be back to try their pizza to see if as good as the BB Jacks in northern Wisconsin."}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3-4 times since they opened. The food and service used to be good. Stopped there tonight to carry out. Maybe 20 people in the bar and seated at tables. Waited at the bar for ten minutes to order food and a drink while I waited. The bartender ignored me while refilling someone's drink next to me, other orders and then went to the other end of the bar started chatting up some regulars. I finally left. Not that anyone noticed."}
{"text":"Pot Roast is top notch!! It's the best I've ever eaten! U will not be sorry! Best service when u eat it at the bar . Will be a regular"}
{"text":"Great food, great selection of beers, and great service. The fried cheese, fried pickles, and chicken wings were delicious. Went there for Mother's Day brunch as well, and was very happy with that decision. The owner is very creative with his recipes, and truly cares about the customer experience."}
{"text":"We come here for fish fry almost every Friday and we have never had a bad experience.  Food, drinks and service have always been great.  We have also been here for pizza on Monday nights a few times and the pizza is great as well."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza every sandwich I've had from there has been great. Had the wings tonight good wings horrible blue cheese. Order wings again but stop at the grocery store for blue cheese"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar with an empty glass.  My friend who is a male with an empty glass next to my empty glass gets eye contact ftom the female bartender while she doesn't look at me or ask about my empty glass.  She fills his and never even gives me the time of day.  Other male bartender not any better.  I try to flag down either one 10 min. NO luck.  Service sucks."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great wings, continue to go there again and again!  Great beer selection..specials are fun and inventive...lunch or dinner you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the one-star review I just read is just extremely unfortunate as I couldn't disagree more.  The pizza is great, in fact, it was so good we decided to visit again three days later.  The restaurant is busy-it's a very welcome addition to DeForest so I think the previous one-star would have been better with Jimmy Johns or Pizza Hut.  I enjoyed a great bourbon ale beer on tap and my wife had a BB's Bloody Mary that was huge and a meal on its own.  The service was great as we did have to wait for a table but once seated our drinks were always filled and our order was promptly taken.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't order the Lake Louie Warped Speed. It comes in a shot glass. Food good service Ok."}
{"text":"Best bar for a little town. Don't go anywhere else if you are in De Forest. Great selection of beer, great food and wait staff are amazing. Even if you get a chance you can talk to the chef. He knows his stuff!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The bar area was beautiful and seemed very inviting, however, since we were having lunch we sat at a table. Our waitress, April, was very attentive and kept our drink glasses topped off...always a plus. 
We started with fried pickles which were lightly battered with a cornmeal batter. Served with a spicy Ranch dressing- great appetizer!
We all ordered something different and all decided we would try each other's meal when we returned. 
If you're not sure what to order, go with the incredible steak salad with house bleu cheese!!!! It was a HUGE salad but I couldn't stop eating until I finished off every piece of steak! Always love fresh ingredients!
I will definitely be back when I return to the area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food accompanied by great service from a great serving staff! The Baked Italian Beef sandwich with tots is amazing! The pizza fries are great appetizers! Bartender Willy and manager Lowell are fabulous at ensuring you have a great time!"}
{"text":"They have really good chicken wings here. But.. not the best fish tacos. (Hence the 4 stars). But if you want good chicken wings and drinks this place should be on your list. The decor in the place is pretty cool too. I really dig the fans on the ceiling... at least that what I remember them being... anyway, chicken wings... go there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad food. Bland American food for senior citizens or those with unrefined pallets."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars cause it's pretty average 
Sometimes the service is not that great, we've had our orders messed up a couple times
The price seems reasonable 
It would be so nice if they could get many more booths the tables leave with no space practical on top of other dinners"}
{"text":"If I had written this review after the first time I ate there I would have given them 5 stars. The Alfredo is to die for! Tonight however, I order fried pickles, the flavor is awesome but they are very soggy, so I would have given them 4 stars but I also ordered a grilled cheese, it looks like they cooked one side then flipped it over just long enough to turn the butter a slight brown. So order the Alfredo, you won't be disappointed (unless it was a fluke!)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the atmosphere is nice and the prices are favorable. The only issue I've ever had here is poor service. I've been here 6 or 7 times and have received a rude waitress in half of those visits."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. Four of us in our party had the baked cod. It was moist and flavorful. Cheesy hash browns  homemade and plentiful. We will return."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Great service. They got very busy over lunchtime and Jessica, our server, did a great job! Great variety of tap beers and labeled well on their signage. Food was all good- tasty fresh salads, great Reuben sandwich, fish,bacon cheese burger. Generous portions and great variety of sides to choose from. Will definitely go back when we are in the area. You will NOT leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I believe my family has found our #2 favorite pizza place. It was recommended by other friends, but the Yelp reviews concerned me a little. We were happy with the service and the food, though. I had to dock them one star because they were out of the beer I wanted although their digital board still had it listed."}
{"text":"Great staff! Great atmosphere! Decided to stop in for a drink after Christmas shopping this year and had a margarita. Let's just say that they didn't skimp on the tequila (Made from scratch rather than a premix). Much appreciated! It was half priced pizza night so we ordered the bbq chicken. It was very delicious! Will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a couple of thier awesome craft beers they have on tap.    I believe they had like 15 - 20 different selections to choose from.  To me that os pretty impressive for a small town joint like this.  We chose to sit at the bar where we were greeted immediately by a friendly bartender.  She told us the specials and was answerd a few of our questions.  We decided to go with a pizza for dinner being thier special of the evening was 1/2 off pizzas.  We tried the BB JACKS supreme.  Everything was pretty good.  We liked the sauce, the crust, and all the toppings.  If I had one critique, I would say cook down your green peppers just for a min in a sautee pan so they dont go on the pizza so crunchy raw tasting.  Just my opinion though.  This establishment is clean and very nice.  If you are in the area it is worth a stop.  Especially if you like craft beers they have a nice selection of some unique ones."}
{"text":"There's always a bit of hesitation hitting up a place with meh reviews, but we met our friends here on Monday for half-priced pizza, so we thought why not and what's better than cheap pizza?!  Apparently everyone else likes the thought of that too because the place was packed at 6pm and we even had to wait about 20 min for a table.  I was pleasantly surprised that they had a 12\" gluten free crust for my pepperoni pizza.  It wasn't the best GF crust I've had, but I never really expect too much in that regard, especially for a place like this.  So here's the thing and why I'm giving 3 stars.  I LOVE cheese...I mean if you ask what is my favorite food, its cheese.  But perhaps this is the one time I've experienced too much cheese (I can't even believe those words are coming out of my mouth).  They probably could put about 1/2 - 2/3 the amount of cheese on their pizzas and it would be WAY better because the flavors of the sauce and toppings would be more apparent.  The mozzarella just overpowered and I didn't feel like it was a good balance of ingredients overall.  Secondly, the service was rather lacking.  Our waitress and others did the basics, but we had to ask for more water, ask for plates, ask for more napkins, etc.  So the attention to detail there could have been much better.  I'd probably go back if we were up in the DeForest area again, but only on a Monday for half price, and only if I remember to request less cheese!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink! This is really my go-to restaurant in DeForest. There is a rotating beer selection with lots of great craft beers. Different pizzas each week and some of the proceeds from their specialty pizza goes to charity. I have always had great food here. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Love any place that has vegetarian option for burgers! Everything seems super fresh and they make their own fries and chips. Wait staff seems like they enjoy their job and were knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Great selection of beers on tap made it a perfect 5/5 for my first visit."}
{"text":"Was here Friday night early enough to get a seat at the bar. The old fashion was good, but $6 is a little much to charge. Got the fish which was ok the Cole slaw was also ok, but nothing really to write home about. The cheesy hash browns are really cheese potatoes. And yea I know this is a minor difference, but when you want cheesy hash browns what they serve here is not what I think of.
We also order the spinach dip. It was server cold in the middle. And was followed way to quickly by our dinner. It remained mostly uneaten. I would have ask our server to have it heated up, but sadly she was over taxed by the three tables she had in her section.
Poor service makes everything worse, and this place is a case in point."}
{"text":"bb Jack's earned high marks on our first visit on this fall, October evening.  Recommended by friends, we enjoyed the friendly atmosphere, accommodating staff, delicious food, and ice cold beverages at bb Jack's.  The ladies sipped house merlot and the guys had beer - sampling a beer flight of four tasty beers from their several draught options - extensive beer options on tap - impressive.  For an appetizer we tried the deep fried pickle chips - tasty, but the breading was maybe thicker than I like and had a tendency to detract from the dill flavor.  For dinner the ladies tried the French fried grilled cheese sandwich - bb Jack's homage to the local and Wisconsin dairy industry.  There was hope that they might be more like the \"cheese frenchy's served in the '70's \"on the square\" at Kings Food Host - that would have been fun! Interesting sandwich and interpretation by deep frying the \"baked cheese\" and serving inside the grilled sandwich - both earned thumbs up for the eclectic \"cheese\" presentation,  but I don't believe either would order it again.  Joe sampled the \"Randy's Mac & Cheese\", another cheesy dish accented with bacon and jalapenos - delicious.  I had the broasted chicken and baby back ribs servced with homemade, house fries.  Excellent.  Ribs were \"fall off the bone\" without being over cooked, topped with just the right amount of bbq sauce and the chicken was really broasted - crispy on the outside and juicy and tasty on the inside.  The house fries were excellent as well.  Lowell, the GM, stopped by our table to share some of the bb Jack's history and welcome us - nice touch.  Our conversation led to purchasing a bb Jack's / Lake Louie pint glass and Lowell share his and bb Jack's support of breast cancer awareness month with some pink t-shirts for the table!  Thank you Lowell for your support.  Dinner was followed with some playful banter with the local patrons and our friendly server, Jamie,  offering everyone in the bar some scoops of \"blue bunny ice cream\" and chocolate sauce - beer and ice cream - oh well, probably only in Wisconsin.  That's where you'll find your local and family owned bb Jack's - only in Wisconsin - Antigo, Wausau and now in Deforest - a welcome addition to the Deforest and Madison dining scene.  Stop by bb Jacks the next time you are in Deforest, I know you'll enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Been here three times. It's ok.....the servers and bartenders are all really young and like to converse in groups. It slows service down.

I'm not a fan of the building. Last time we were there, it was cold and windy. We chose a seat as far from the front 2 doors (dumb design) as possible, next to a side door that had a sign that said \"do not use\". EVERYONE USED THIS DOOR!!! The manager even held it open for customers to come in and out. We complained, and our very young server apologized and offered to move us, be we had food and drinks and coats and appetizer plates everywhere.

I probably won't be back because of this. I can't imagine a small restaurant needs 4 entrances and exits.

Food is meh."}
{"text":"The pizza is great here along with all of the food.  Reasonably priced lots of local beers on tap.  However the service has gone from very good to below average which is disappointing because we like the food so much."}
{"text":"This was my first non-Madison outing since moving west. If every place after follows suite, it'll be a good thing.  The staff here was the selling point, as the servers and bartenders all had great personality. They do a great job with showing Badger love on all the televisions around the bar, and just about every seat has a view. 

Beer selection is pretty great among the taps, and typical townie options are available in the cooler. Cocktail pricing is pretty decent. I don't think $6 is too much for an old fashioned, but that's just me I suppose. 

We've done pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and the fish fry here. Everything has been good. Nothing screams out to rush back, but we didn't have any complaints about anything we've eaten or drank. I'm perfectly happy to have a consistent middle ground near home, so we'll keep at it and see if things get better as we go."}
{"text":"I've spoken to many people about their experiences at BB Jack's since their opening.  Opinions fell equally on each side of the fence for months, however the good recently began to pull ahead of the bad. I thought that I would venture over yesterday to pick up an order to-go for a late lunch.

I visited their website to peruse the menu and was happy to see its straightforward approach.  I had a good idea of what to order given the recommendations from coworkers.  An order consisting of a Reuben and fries with two additional large orders of tater tots (one for myself and the other for a coworker that seems to be craving them constantly) was going to take 15 to 20 minutes to prepare.  Not a problem.

I made a point to be picking up at the 20 minute mark to prevent the food from sitting too long.  Walking in I had the feeling that I was walking into a dentist office rather than a restaurant.  Something about the atmosphere just seemed...sterile.  After asking for my order, I waited a couple of minutes for what I assumed to be fresh tots and fries.  Not a problem.

Less than five minutes after pickup I was ready to destroy my meal.  When I opened the box I was immediately surprised at the size of my reuben.  Each half was slightly larger than my wallet and the bread appeared to be pretty greasy.  The nice size portion of fries looked good, but half of them were fairly soggy.  Same went for the tater tots.  On the plus side, the reuben wasn't terrible, and the fries/tots that were not soggy were VERY good.  I just wish that there had been more of them.  All in all...meh."}
{"text":"We normally love this place. It is nice to have a good restaurant locally in Deforest. I must say the service and wait times are getting a bit disappointing. On a Thursday we had a group of eight. Took 15minutes to get waited on.. Then it took 1 hour and 15  minutes to get our food. They were not that busy. Food was mediocre at best. Come on BB jacks, don't blow it. We love having you in town."}
{"text":"My first \"not good\" review, rats.

Were seated next to a family with young children... No sweat.  10 minutes into our experience the 3 year old starts screaming at the top of his lungs... It goes on, and on, until we ask the waitress to help quiet him some. It looked like I had put a gun in her face.  Turns out it was the owner that she was obviously afraid of.  I turned to look at the child and the \"owner\" come over and asked if there was something wrong. I said I was not used to dining next to a screaming kid.  His response was this is a kid friendly supper club. I told him I had raised my children, loved them, but they were never allowed to scream at the top of their lungs in a public restaurant, and my sister in law had a hearing problem that was causing her pain.  He said, I've got your dinner and maybe next time you can find somewhere else to eat...  I had to respond.
I told him, welcome to a small town where everyone knows everyone else.  
It was obvious he was a bully, and an arrogant ass.
Personally I think he really should consider going back to Chicago.  Try the Roadhouse instead... They are nice."}
{"text":"45 minute wait on food. Every table sat around us got tgere food. Then a gentleman comes out when I said we wanted to leave and says \"sorry, we were busy\". The other server that came over tried hard to recover us. She did a great job but it was just too little too late. Not a good way to handle the situation. Will give it a try again, hopefully a one time deal."}
{"text":"After reading the glowing reviews on Facebook, I decided to make the short drive to DeForest and check out BB Jacks.  After suffering through some service issues and some lackluster food, I learned two things:
1. Never trust Facebook for restaurant reviews (Didn't mean to cheat on you Yelp, it's just you were slow on the draw on getting this new restaurant listed.)
2. I will not be returning to BB Jack's anytime soon.

My daughter had a late soccer game in Waunakee, so I decided to call in a carryout order for a pizza and a Reuben sandwich.  I was told that my order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes, just the amount of time I needed to drive from Waunakee to DeForest.  Things were looking good...

I arrive 15 minutes after I called, checked in at the bar and lo and behold, my pizza was ready to go.  I paid for my order; the bartender brought my pizza to the bar and thanked me for my order.  One small problem, no Reuben sandwich.  When I asked the bartender about its status, I got a confused look and he scampered into the kitchen.  He came out, told me it was not ready yet, and then tended to the other customers at the bar, which was packed on a Thursday evening.

So I waited...and waited...and waited.  

And I watched my pizza get colder...and colder...and colder.

One of the servers sitting at the bar told me the kitchen prepared the pizzas in a separate area from the rest of the food.  Uh, OK, a useful fact if I ever get a question about BB Jack's kitchen operations during trivia night, but what I really want to know if when my sandwich will be ready.

After ten minutes, another server saw me impatiently waiting by the bar and asked if I have been helped.  I explained my situation and he checked with the kitchen to check on the status of the sandwich.  He indicated it will be a couple of minutes and offers me a drink while I wait.

The sandwich shows us thirteen minutes after my pizza and I hit the road.

The good news first: the tater tots that accompanied my sandwich were well prepared - hot, crispy on the outside and not too greasy.  The folks at BB Jacks have mad deep frying skills.  I could have done without the powdered parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, but if that's their signature touch, so be it. 

To say my Reuben sandwich was dismal would be an understatement.  The main ingredient of the BB Jacks Reuben is a thick layer of bland sauerkraut, which turned my sandwich into a soggy mess by the time I got it home.  The bread was supermarket quality marble rye and needed to be cut thicker to hold up to the all the wet kraut.  The sad layer of corned beef was excessively salty.  The 1000 island dressing had the consistency of warm jello.  It was a paint-by-the-numbers sandwich using institutional grade ingredients.  

The half pepperoni / half cheese pizza also was a bust.  The crust was on the thin side and had no chew and little flavor.  The sauce was applied unevenly, with some spots swimming in sauce and other with just a trace.  The cheese had a strange filmy quality.  I had a couple of pieces and it was so bad that it had me questioning my belief that there is no such thing as a bad slice of pizza.  The capper was that my daughter found a hair on one of her slices.  It was so bad that we didn't even keep the leftovers; the uneaten slices were dumped in the garbage with nary a complaint from my family.

After my dismal experience, I wrote messaged the owner of the restaurant to express my disappointment with the quality of my experience.  To their credit, I received a prompt response from the restaurant manager apologizing for the mix-up on my carryout order.

I really hate to dole out one star ratings, but given the problems with my carryout order and the weak-ass food, the dreaded \"Eek! Methinks not\" description is apropos given my lackluster experience."}
{"text":"I try Rubens everywhere I go.  This one is in the middle.  Skimpy on the meat but it tasted good with bits of corned beef so it wasn't the sliced lunch meat some places try to pass off in their Rubens.  The dressing was served in the side which I liked.  For $9 you get a choice of tater tots, French fries, chips and salsa or pub chips.  I was told to get the tots and they were very good.  Crisp with a sprinkling of shredded Parmesan cheese.  We started with the loaded tots as an appetizer but found it to be too much to eat with a sandwich so we took most of our lunch home, including 1/2 of the loaded tots.  The lemonade was tasty and service was adequate.  I would go back to try other items on the menu, including the vegetable roll-up when I get back on the wagon with a whole food plant based diet."}
{"text":"Excellent food! All made from scratch and daily specials, always something new to try and the pizzas are amazing! Excellent fish too on Fridays! The staff is friendly and good service , Will be a regular! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Came to BB Jack's to celebrate my husband' birthday. It was a Friday night and we were lucky to get a table right away. 

We had prompt service right away to order our drinks and food. Ordered their cheese curds/fried cheese which is our go-to appetizer every time. So delicious!  Our server made a point to ask which dipping sauce we wanted...we requested the ranch and marinara. It arrived with only the marinara...but that was quickly fixed. 

Our pizza came but our waitress never did to refill drinks. We finally were able to flag down a gentleman who I assumed was a manager and he took our next drink order.  I wish young servers would get that the more you sell me (drinks, appetizers) the bigger our bill and the bigger your tip will be. 

Pizza was good but possibly with too much cheese??  Nice crust and a flavorful sauce. Next time we will be back for their fish fry as our neighbors had delicious looking fish fries."}
{"text":"Wierd ambiance.  Kind of like a \"church parish hall meets a supperclub\". Food mediocre.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Friday fish fry.  Nothing special, nothing stands out.  Coleslaw not good. All in all, I'd rather have Culvers fish fry."}
