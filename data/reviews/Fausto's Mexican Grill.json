{"text":"This is my go-to for Carne Asada Fries. They've ruined this for me -- I can't be satisfied anywhere else but here at Fausto's. Whenever I'm in town, I always get this. My brother loves their breakfast burritos and their California burrito con papas. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"This place never fails me!!! Awesome eats even late at now and good customer service. They keep it nice and clean inside too which is definitely not what you usually get at a Robertos :( this place is consistent,  decently priced and even open late. Give them a try if you're looking for Mexican food in the area. I've been to all of the ones in this area and this one is the best by FAR!!! Super stoked to have such a consistently yummy place nearby :) Big thanks to Faustos! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, but I had to dock it one-star simply because the service and some of the menu items could be improved (very easily, I might add). I love the super nachos w/carne asada and the chicken quesadillas (no veggies added) w/sour cream on the side. So good!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken nachos. My wife and I always split one and it is enough for the both of us."}
{"text":"haven't found nothing wrong with the place. been in and out this place for a few years. bacon and eggs breakfast burrito and Cali burrito. carne asada fries all good in my pocket too."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding here. Portions are a good size. Lots of variety to choice from. Staff doesn't seem to leave behind the counter. There's a small salsa bar but nothing to fuss about. I've had the fish tacos which were a little bland. Same for the chicken burritos, not much flavor. Not sure why I expected this place to be good, bigger menu than del taco but not much on taste. If you're hungry and need a quick bite I guess it'll do."}
{"text":"This is one of the first local Mexican food places my fianc√© and I ate at after we first moved to Henderson. The prices are super affordable and the food is delicious. We've frequented this location ever since and are never unsatisfied."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Fausto's for years and have never been let down. Quick service and good quality food. Everything we have tried has been great with very generous portions, the combo plates are enough for us to get two meals out of."}
{"text":"My office orders breakfast burritos here ALL THE TIME!!  They are enough for breakfast AND lunch. Fresh. Hot. Filling. Doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"Just had a chicken bean and rice burrito, not the best Iv'e had.  getting sick of all these mexican places tasting the same (see Robertos)"}
{"text":"Our go to place for affordable (dare I say cheap?) TexMex.  Consistently good.  Not diet friendly, except the carne asada sans tortillas or the chicken burrito unwrapped from the huge flour tortilla.  Both are a low carbers dream.  Favorites when I do decide to indulge is the Fish burrito and the Shrimp Burrito (which breaks the cheese/seafood rule of thumb, but it works).  The breakfast burritos are outstanding.  Quesadilla's are huge and cheesy.  Quick service, reliable to go service which always get your phone orders right and it's almost always ready in 10 minutes.  Oh, and the Super Nachos are great.  Not healthy at all, but great."}
{"text":"Hey guys keep doing what you're doing over there the food is always good I'll never eat at Roberto's again you guys have my business"}
{"text":"Ordering a Nevada Burrito ? You might want to check before you leave ! The employees play the innocent no engli??? card but in reality they will take advantage of you by not putting steak in your burrito. Not only has this happened once but it has happended twice!! I have confronted them twice and they act like they haven't done anything wrong. Looks like robertos is the real winner !"}
{"text":"I must have gone on a bad day, because my husband and I both thought that this place was terrible.  I actually made my husband take me here to try something new, based on the Yelp reviews.  It was awful!  I had rolled tacos, which tasted like the Delimex frozen rolled tacos available at the grocery store.  My husband had a burrito that no amount of salsa could help.  The condiments (e.g., the sliced carrots) seemed old.  

I've heard that the other location in Henderson is tons better, and maybe one day (HUGE maybe), I'll try the other location.  In the meantime, I have to give this place a big two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Way better than the Roberto's across the street.  Their portions are bigger and they don't nickel and dime you like the Roberto's franchise on Eastern.  Great and fast service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 1 star because I can't give it a zero. First of, I was ready to place my order but the she-man cashier was busy chatting with a friend. I waited patiently but after 10 minutes I asked if I could order she looked irritated that i interrupted their conversation. When I ordered the carne asada burrito she told me if I was sure because it'll take 10-15 minutes to make. I told her yes and she gave me this irritated look. So I was waiting for my food which took forever the to go bag had blood stains on it. I notified her and she said oh no that's just a red marker. A red marker? Are you kidding me? So I asked her if I could get a different bag again she gave me this angry look. The food was horrible. The meat was cold and hard. The rice was dry and the beans were very watery. I will never eat here again. Rude cashier and very unprofessional. I am not sure how this place has 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love Fausto,s. I have been eating here for years!  I get upset when people compare it to Roberto's.  The food is way better!  Place is way cleaner. The service model resembles that other taco shop but Fausto's food is leaps and bounds better!  Horizon Ridge is the best location, but I have eaten at them all.  One of my very favorites. Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Simple, yummy Mexican Food for a super low price. They are fast, and their portions are freakin huge (especially their burritos - like whoa... time to unbutton the top button if ya know what I mean). No but seriously, the burritos are no joke. LEGIT."}
{"text":"I have gone in there numerous times and each time I feel like going there they always get my order wrong I'm tired of this!  I'm sorry they don't listen and they don't do a good job for me!"}
{"text":"Love the California burrito, super decadent al pastor fries. nice to find  mexican food in Henderson."}
{"text":"They have really good tamales here! The tacos are good to love the tortilla they give you with the carintas/ asada plate."}
{"text":"Cashier at a retail store over heard my nephew and I talking about wanting some Carne Asada Super Nachos. She recommended Faustos and swore up and down that it was great. I always go to Pepe's for my Super Nachos fix because their meat and beans are very tasty and the use of melted nacho cheese (like the kind you find at gas stations) makes theirs #1 in my book but we figured we'd give this joint a shot. The food was not bad at all but ok at best, the atmosphere was clean and festive and the employees were nice but this reminded me of a knock off Roberto's, which I dont care for much.

#enjoylife #eatwell"}
{"text":"Something must be different here. The lobby was filthy, portions are smaller yet the prices have gone up. Staff not nearly as friendly as I remember. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! We went in and clearly ordered carne asada nachos and a NEVADA burrito. The cashier who was the manager also repeated our order back to us. We quickly noticed we didn't get a Nevada burrito and calmly told the manager that and asked for the right one. The manager quickly got angry saying that we order a carne asada burrito. We told him we did not and the manager called us insane and crazy. He was putting up a big fight with us. Arguing that we order a carne asada burrito. At the end of the conversation he called us \"shitty\" customers. We were so disgusted by this man we wanted our money back immediately. The manager REFUSED to give back our money. I  noticed a video camera on top of the cashier and asked him if his video recording had audio so we can prove to him that what we asked if was we ordered for. He said yes, but only the owner has access to it. I quickly called the other locations to talk to the owner and I told him the whole story. The owner told us if we can put the manager on the phone, but he refused to talk to us. So the owner called the store and talked to the manager. I hope this manager gets fired honestly. You do not call your customers shitty and crazy. After his phone call with the owner he quickly made the right burrito we order, even though I asked for my money. They're service was so disgusting it made their food disgusting also. We decided to leave after receiving the burrito because we were tired of all this bull sh*t. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Authentic and tasty treat at any time during the day. Started with chicken tacos and added both their rojo and verde salsas. Well done Senor Fausto."}
{"text":"Fausto's is good and cheap. It's home of the \"Super Duper Snacktastic Nacho's\". (Name should be on the Menu some day)"}
{"text":"Extremely good food for very cheap. Got a bean and cheese burrito for only $2.35 and two carne asada tacos and the food came in like 3 minutes. This place is fast, cheap, and a must try!"}
{"text":"I was driving around earlier tonight desperately looking for something different- not the same old fast food I eat almost every night.

Driving past a strip mall on south Stephanie I spotted the Fausto's sign at the last second. It's tucked away in the strip mall behind a building that is closer to the street so it's real easy to miss.

I've had bad luck with local \"authentic\" Mexican places here in town so I took a few minutes to decide before going in.

I'm really glad I decided to give this place a try. I decided on the 2 steak taco meal for $6 which is pretty reasonable. I added a medium soft drink and was only charged $1 extra for a total of $7.

Much to my surprise the steak tacos were among the best I've ever had- anywhere. Delicious steak with no fat or gristle cooked perfectly and served on soft corn tortillas with a fresh pico salsa and guacamole. Very very tasty and surprisingly large. 2 tacos is an ample portion. You also get the usual Spanish rice and refried beans- both of which were very tasty also.

I will definitely be going back here and try more stuff. I see the California burrito recommended several times in other reviews, so it's next up for my next visit.

Glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I came to this place since chile verde was closed

And was I surprised how good the food was,

It's hard finding a real Mexican authentic food place in Vegas however this place does not disappoint

The prices may be a little more expensive then other places however your still getting your money's worth,

We had a breakfast burrito came with eggs and potatoes, it was really good,

We had the carne asada fries, the fries were a tad undercooked not much to complain about due to the taste of the meat and toppings guacamole and sour cream with cheese was amazing on the fries

The carne asada burrito was also very good the meat was fresh and tasted great

I highly recommend this place or chile verde,"}
{"text":"Potato, egg and cheese burrito, the RIGHT way to start the morning!!"}
{"text":"i know its greasy crap but.. I love it! I know its probably cheap but it is amazing especially carne asada, i ordered the wrong thing once and they didn't make me pay when i reordered this is the defenition of fast food, super fast and afordable"}
{"text":"Im sooo angry and dissapointed with this place....I ordered a breakfast (chilaquiles)and the rice and beans were good BUT the chilaquiles were so tasteless and when I told the staff the guy told me..\"THERES SALT\" and just pointed to the salt..the whole staff was giving me a rude attitude..I will NEVER eat here and WILL spread the word!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I moved out here from L.A. and couldn't find a good fast food Mex place anywhere here til I went to Faustos. Roberto's is open 24/7 but their food and service sucks. Even when my family comes into town from L.A. they want to go to Faustos(they live in East L.A.) 
My favorites are the super nachos carne asada,California burrito,chimichanga plate and menudo for the quick hang over fix. Lol Everyone at work also loves Faustos. Trust me, you can not go wrong with Faustos. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough Faustos. We've tried several menu items and everything is great. I think their rice is the best in Vegas. I have tried so many places. I always get an extra side of rice now. The # 10 is my favorite, a chicken taco and a cheese enchilada with rice and beans. My sons love the burritos which are huge and delicious. They just told me they have Carne Asada fries so we are trying those next. Be sure to get a jalapeno from the salsa bar, it goes great with the beans and your meal. I'm so glad I found Faustos. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Fantastic food. Great price. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"No matter what time of day, this is the place for filling, hot and delicious Mexican food. There's just something a little better about this particular establisment... Perhaps it's because they remember us when we visit or the food is always fresh and hot right off the stove! You can't go wrong here, make sure you get the Carne Asada!"}
{"text":"I love their Carne Asada Super Nacho!!! Its only 6$ and the Portion is very generous.
The restaurant is always clean and the food is served very fast. Its only Mexican Fast Food that I go to. I recommend this place and I always talk to friends."}
{"text":"Been a fan of Fausto's for years now and thanks to Yelp I found out about this location. Was also happy to see one of the hardest workers from Stephanie location working at this one. Great food. Can't go wrong with a bacon breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are made with grocery store fish sticks that you would feed a child you didn't like. Why?"}
{"text":"just tried this place today. i'm way into it. i got a veggie burrito, it contained rice, refried beans, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and pico de gallo. all the ingredients were fresh and good quality. the tortilla was really good and they grilled it just right. my burrito was only $4, making it the most reasonably priced (decent) burrito i've been able to find in town. they have a killer salsa bar with some of the most refreshing green i've ever tasted. they have a big menu with lots of stuff i want to try, including breakfast and california burritos. i look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The best mexican food I've had in vegas so far.  Everything on the menu is great.  Good prices and huge portions.  Great for takeout."}
{"text":"I think this is definitely the place to go for late night mexican food in the area.  The service is super quick and prices are low.  Burritos are big but I usually prefer to go with nachos.  They definitely don't skimp on the meat  and cheese so the nachos is really a meal for 2.  

While the more traditional \"carne asada\" is good, I really suggest you try the lesser known \"al pastor\".  Its a very flavorful but mild spicy pork which goes good on any menu item."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  

Big selection (including breakfast, they open early, 6:00AM I think),  Ginormous portions, tasty and priced right.  Highly recommend this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Ordered the super nacho, two soft asada tacos and one soft chicken taco. Pretty good. But the food was room temp at best, and I have had better."}
{"text":"It's  very cheap on your pockets and very good to your eyes and fare on taste. It beats the other places. I will return."}
{"text":"I used to come all the time but recently moved further away. I decided to give Super B Burrito a try on Eastern and probably wont go back. My next mexican fast food outing, I went back to Faustos because they were always friendly and the food was good ( for take out ) 

Asked the cashier what comes on their carne asada burrito just to make sure it would be what I wanted. Their burrito comes with carne asade, pico and guacamole. I asked them to add rice and beans, cool, got charged an extra buck like normal. Enjoying the futbol on the television when they call, Carne Asada w/ rice, beans, pico and guac. Smiled and thanked him. 

Got home, unwrapped the burrito and dove it thinking it would be delicious! Not what I had expected. They forgot the guacamole and pico, that sucks. Still tasted ok but couldn't take it back and I was hungry. Ate it."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place. It is good food at a great price I've always liked Robert o's but this place has better food at a lower price. If u haven't had it give it a try for your self you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere,  friendly staff and tasty food. My number one dish are the borritos but admire the other lovely dishes. Price are fair as well."}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 stars, but my burrito had a small trace of cheese, i asked for no cheese, it almost looked like they accidentally put cheese then took it out...but over all its good"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about. I did not enjoy this place. This is a typical \"authentic\" Mexican style restaurant named after a person (you know, Roberto's, Laurita's, Pepe's, Beto's) with \"authentic\" meaning the flour tortillas are semi transparent due to being grilled in lard. I ordered a Machaca Torta, but they gave me a Jamon y Huevo Torta. The torta bread was blackened in places which did not add to the flavor - but detracted from it. The egg was too brown too. Basically, not a good sandwich at all. My wife ordered the #8 (2 Tacos) but got a #9 (Burrito and enchilada). So, it would have been nice to get what we ordered. The cheese in the enchilada was very odd, like thin spaghetti. It retained that shape even after heating. The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The fries were plentiful and good however. Overall, I will not go there again. I think every one of this type of Mexican restaurant get the pictures of their combination plates from the same place."}
{"text":"I should have written about this about a year and a half ago when it happened, but I'm new to Yelp, and am just now getting around to it. I probably used to be one of their most regular customers for a while. I was going there sometimes multiple times per week, and would always get the steak breakfast burrito. It was delicious.
I was always polite when I went there, but for whatever reason, the transgender person who sometimes worked the register seemed to not like me. The last time I went there, he and the rest of the staff were laughing when he handed me my burrito to go. I knew something was up. When I got home, I opened the burrito to check it out, and found several long hairs that were obviously intentionally placed inside the burrito. My first thought was that they were pubic hairs, but they might have been hairs from his head, I'm not sure. I was so disgusted I really couldn't even think about it at the time. I immediately threw it in the trash. They're lucky I didn't call a lawyer, because I definitely could have sued them for this. If I can let others know about it, that's enough for me.
Like I said, I should have written about this when it happened, but better late than never I guess, and I felt the need to get it off of my chest. It was probably the most disgusted I've ever been in my entire life. Obviously I haven't been back since. It made me wonder if they had done anything to my food in the past before that. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Side note: The guy who worked the register when the transgender person wasn't there was always really cool and friendly, and I'm sure would have never done anything like this. It's sad that one or two bad apples have to ruin a perfectly good establishment."}
{"text":"Great for quick mexican food. Great prices as well. Do yourself a favor and call ahead to make your order and it will be ready within 10 minutes! The chicken nachos are a dream if you're into that sorta thing."}
{"text":"Good food, will definitely try again! 
I got a fish taco,  a shrimp taco, and medium drink. 
I loved the shrimp taco! It helped that I caught a glimpse of the cook placing gray fresh shrimp on the grill lol
I was not big on the fish taco, mostly because I don't like fried fish. 
The little condiment bar was nice but some of the radishes did not look fresh."}
{"text":"Love this chain! I've only eaten at this particular location a couple of times but frequent their College/Horizon location at least once a week.  

Their food is always great and prices are very reasonable.  They have the best deep fried chicken tacos and they're carne asada fries are awesome.  The only thing I wish was better is the guacamole but it's not a deal breaker.  Try the taquitos with carne asada on top next time...it's not on the menu but they'll do it if you ask."}
{"text":"Just moved here from central California and my boyfriend and I were craving a taco salad and a burrito. I ordered the chicken taco salad and it was delicious! All of the ingredients looked very fresh and the chicken wasn't drenched in any oily marinades. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered a chicken burrito with a side of rice and beans. Note to self: a chicken burrito is just that-a tortilla filled with chicken! His was very good as well but we have never had to specify that we want a chicken burrito with rice, beans, salsa, cheese etc. This won't deter us from coming back, but wish we had known prior to ordering!"}
{"text":"They have best Mexican food in Las Vegas. I order the Nevada Burrito with Enchalada sauce. There is no better place for Mexican food. The hot carrots r good too."}
{"text":"This taco shop has it all over robertos! Great price and portions, fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"On point Mexican grill. This is our neighborhood Mexican go too. Everything is flavorful and well executed. The lads behind the counter know what they're doing, are nice and treat us like family now.

Go to's are bean and cheese burrito. Their beans are legit. AL pastor tacos... I compare all other AL Pastors to Faustos.

Other notables, the carne asada fries, carne Asada in general an of course the Nevada burrito  (fries inside) or California burrito  (rice instead of fries)"}
{"text":"Standard Mexican Fare.  A lot of people say it's better that Roberto's, but it's exactly the same.  If you didn't see a name on the store front, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

Got the ham & egg breakfast burrito.  It was 80% potato, 10% egg, 10% ham.  I skipped on the cheese.  It's fine if you're starving and need something fast, but don't go out of your way to go here."}
{"text":"Won't be going here again!    This place is somewhat like Roberto's.   First time ever eating here and will be our last.     Walked in and went right up to the cashier and he was not friendly at all.    Very rude I must say.     We ordered 3 bean & cheese burritos and 3 beef tacos.    My bean & cheese burrito the tortilla was burnt all over the place which tasted horrible.     The red salsa was horrible and was drowning in cilantro and other unknown floaters and the green salsa wasn't much better."}
{"text":"SUN MON TUES dollar chicken tacos..best deal..cleanest taco shop i know..quality food and not as greasy"}
{"text":"The food was really good. We ordered a variety from the menu and everyone was happy with their choices. I think it's better than Roberto's. They also have $1 chicken tacos (crunchy only) on taco Tuesdays. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Would have to agree with the 4 star average that Fausto's is receiving. If I lived here Fausto's would be a go to place for take out.  Fast food type restaurant where you order at the counter, but food is better than fast food."}
{"text":"The best Chille Relleno I ever had. That place is busy and the they obviously know what they are doing."}
{"text":"In Henderson the Mexican Grills are scarced. I tried the Carne Asada fries. They were okay. Guacamole looks like it's from a bag. The salsa bar is limited. I won't be mad."}
{"text":"My go to Mexican fast food! I've been coming here for two years and everything I've ever ordered has been made on time and was delicious! Customer service can use just a little working on, but overall very nice."}
{"text":"Not happy. Only reason Im giving it two stars not one is because the plate was huge. Carnitas nachos-I agree with Annie- the pork was dried in places and extremely greasy. Also a LOT of fat. No taste. All I tasted was fat grease. I was really turned off and ate none of it. What a waste of $8 and a waste of food. I always always get pork at every Mexican place & this was the worst."}
{"text":"Awesome asada fries for the price! Been coming here since 2012 and everything has been consistent. Great customer service, which is a breath of fresh air from most fast food establishment."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Got an all pastor burritto. It was full of flavor, very filling and the tortilla was fresh. The red salsa had cilantro which was nice."}
{"text":"Great Mexican comfort food... Love it!

I always try the staple for my Cheese Enchilada and a Chili Rellano.  The sauces are made very well with a complex spice mix.  They made it right.  Have had a California Burrito that was great (carne asada) and Machaca and Chicken burritos.  

The chicken burrito was pretty bland and the meat was old and hard (way overcooked) could have been from the night before. I was there on a Sunday and the cooks looked bored so I think they were slow and getting rid of old ingredients.  Anyway.  I have had 3  - 5 star meals here and  1 - 2 star meal,  so there you go..... 

I still will go there, overall it is pretty good, maybe Ill dine in and say something to the manager if it sux....."}
{"text":"Really good dirty mex been goimg for years. Its not in the same class as Carlios Burritos but its very soild (Probably apples and oranges comparison though). Bottom line its way better than Robertos when your in the mood for some down and dirty mexican. Corezo Breakfast burrito is top notch especially with thier great red sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious food, especially the burritos. It ain't California-level Mexican, but probably some of the best in town. Worth a visit. Well priced."}
{"text":"Horrible food no flavor and the over do it with their no taste guacamole. Service very bad, asada looked more like boiled than grilled."}
{"text":"Reminded me of home back in so cal. This is a great hole in the wall type of Mexican joint. You can get full for less then $20 for two people. The red salsa is my favorite. It's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I order the rolled beef tacos and the guacamole they served on top was brown already, they couldn't even put fresh guacamole on it. Come on now !"}
{"text":"It's true what they say--hole in the wall places are where it's at!
I've been coming to Fausto's for a over a year now and they come though without fail when it comes to my late night cravings. The menu offers a wide variety of delicious authentic Mexican food. The portions come out pretty big and extremely inexpensive--always a plus!

I usually come for their Nevada burrito or the carne asada fries. Usually, I would call the place for a pick-up order and have them get started on it. They are super fast and will have it ready for you in 10-15 minutes. Super fast!

The only reason why I gave them 3 stars is because I'm big on customer service. Their staff seem to be in a rush at times and not as personable--especially when I'm ordering on the phone, but that's just me.
Regardless of that, the food was so good it doesn't bother me as much. I just come back willingly wanting more."}
{"text":"Cold food and the old lady has the nerve to argue with me smh never will I return to this place!!"}
{"text":"My co-worker wanted to go have lunch together and when we couldn't decide, of course we decided mexican because there is always so many choices when choosing mexican food. I asked her if she wanted to go to Roberto's then. She said no lets go to Fausto's instead. I told her I had never tried that place and she goes \"What?! How could you have gone to Roberto's but not Fausto's\" I told her that regardless the mexican food here in Vegas has nothing on the mexican food in the bay area (which is where I am from). So Fausto's it was for lunch. I chose the carne asada tacos with onion and cilantro. Now, yes it was still nothing like what I am used to but it still was full with flavor. I also like the rice and beans on the side as well. I rate this place 4 stars because the salsa was just not hot enough. It was rich in flavor but just not spicy enough and I mixed the green and red salsa as I always do. But still missing that kick."}
{"text":"Stunned this place has 4 stars. Seems my last review was racially insensitive so Yelp headquarters reached out to me and explained how they had to remove it. So here it is again a more refined version. The kid behind the register charged me twice for the same order. I called to explain but due to the language barrier that stems from are more darker pigmented neighbors to the south it was difficult to communicate. This prompted me to drive over and show them on my banking App that I was charged $12.85 twice in the same min. Maybe our neighbors to the south are not familiar with banking or something??? When I had proof in my hand they argued with me said I was wrong and offered me nothing. The darker skinned femle even dug through the trash can looking for a receipt from the night before why? No idea!  Wtf is that going to do? So I left frustrated. When I returned home I had a text message saying they were in the wrong to come back they would refund my cash. They must of got my number off the caller ID . The way I see it they can keep the whole 12.85 well worth it to be able to keep putting reviews up about this place. Avoid this place at all times. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"being near my house I have tried this place......many times :)

THEY DO NOT USE LARD, believe me, I have asked several different times on several different occasions. I think I have asked each person that works there. LOL they probably call me LARD WOMAN :) 

even when my parents came into town, they were hungry after the Neon Museum and out of allllllll the fresh yummies I had at my house...no one wanted to cook :)

I always order a vegetarian burrito no cheese no sour cream and my mom went with me to order. She asked to have whole beans and not refried (why did not think of this?!?!?) so whole pintos we got :) 

The veggie has rice, beans, guac, fresh yummy pico, lettuce and is always their HUGE size. It also has sour cream and cheese, but I leave those off.

I can not get enough of their spicy carrots and radish. That pickled yummy madness I could just take the whole container secretly out the door with me.

Hubby tried my veggie burrito once and said is was better than his chicken lol, so now I order him a veggie with just a little chicken :)

not to mention how yummy their green and red sauce is...you can dip out for yourself

I would love to try other things.....like the rolled tacos with guac on top.....or the carne estada.....

Roberto's is soooooooo gross! This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Even though it's fast food, it's clean and tasty. That's what matters most. I always get the carne asada and chicken soft tacos. It comes with heaping meat, lettuce, and cheese. 
since I haven't found a great Mexican restaurant in town, I opt for this place whenver I need my fix."}
{"text":"Three time is enough chancre to give this Faustos any more business. Each time I order simple grilled chicken tacos with pico and Guac. Each time its never correct and the tacos tortillas fall to pieces. Food ends up everywhere but in my mouth. Sloppy mees and bland salty. The Rainbow Faustos was always good. This Horizon store is busy and should not be doing any business. 5 thumbs down."}
{"text":"YUM!  I was looking for a quick bite to eat with my friend before I left Vegas.  Found this taco shop right down the street.  It was great!  Fresh chips, salsa, burritos.  Price was very affordable.  Worth cheking out if you are in the area, you wont be let down!"}
{"text":"One thing that disappoints me about Las Vegas, is the lack of REALLY GOOD hole in the wall Mexican places.  It seems that all of the mexican that comes up on my yelp search is always robertos, don tortacos or taco bell.  Really disappointing.  I've also been to the Bonito Michoacan and I'm not super impressed.  I used to live in California, so I just miss those really good, line-out-the-door mexican spots where there's a huge language barrier but the most amazing food ever! 

I have been wanting to try Fausto's for quite some time.  I keep watching the yelp reviews because everyone seems to be a fan, but I wasn't convinced that this place that resembles a robertos could be that great.  I think it's the way the menu looks or something, but it was a difficult one for me to actually give a shot.  

I got a supreme chicken burrito.  It was awesome.  The only thing I didn't like about it, was how it was served for dine in.  I prefer to cut open my burritos and eat them with a fork and knife but the little dish they gave me to eat off of was too small for the burrito and it would have been half sitting on the table.  LOL.  

Their salsa bar is very similar to that of Robertos.  It was comforting that while I was there a ton of mexican families came through and ordered + seemed to be regulars of the place.  

I look forward to trying more menu items and boosting this up another star to confirm that this is the best Mexican hole-in-the-wall place in Las Vegas.  :)"}
{"text":"Just came from eating here- was going to only give it two stars but decided to be charitable. Let's start with the good- the cheese quesadilla and taco al pastor weren't bad...but as it's hard to mess a cheese quesadilla up, that's not saying much. Now the bad: we also tried the chicken tacos and the chili relleno...the chicken tacos were so hard it was impossible to bite into them. Then the chili relleno...the first bite tasted like I had bit into a big ball of cigarette smoke...not sure why, but that was what came into my mind the second I bit into it. I tried a few more bites, but the taste was so off, I just couldn't. I ended up eating my rice and beans and throwing the rest of my food plus most of the kids chicken tacos away. I really wanted to like and support this place- but there are so many better Mexican restaurants - I definitely don't recommend it."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine turned me on to this place a few years ago and I've been coming here ever since. I only get one thing here, and they do it better than anyone else.

California burrito - When you first see this thing, what  comes to mind is \"how am I going to finish this thing\"? But it goes down pretty easily. This burrito is loaded with rice, beef and sauce and guacamole. At roberto's you'll end up paying more for a burrito that is loaded with mostly potatoes, not beef. 

If you're hungry and need a quick pick me up, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We went there on the recommendation of a guy that works at the sports book in Eastside Cannery. I ordered a carne asada burrito. It was good size, about $5.50. It was a guacamole sauce and a ton of meat! No beans, no rice. A nice surprise, though next time I'd add beans. 
My friend had the carnitas plate. $8.25 (or $8 something). It had a lot of meat, beans, rice, lettuce and guacamole sauce. Also two huge flour tortillas. I tried it, and it was really good! The guy taking orders speaks English, but a heavy Mexican accent. He got our order right. You order at the counter, pay, then sit down. He will call you up to the counter when your food is ready. Seating is tight, the place was clean. You get your own cups of salsa."}
{"text":"Ill start at the door. Definitely a \"hole in the wall\" but I would recommend this place to my closest friends and family. I personally ordered a steak burrito combination (rice + beans on side). I found that my food was perfect temperature, wasn't \"thrown together\" like other places in town, and was frankly delicious! The rice was not dry and had great flavor. My burrito was phenomenal, they had some a.w.e.s.o.m.e salsa as well. I will be back! Thank you for the delicious meal Fausto's!"}
{"text":"Carne asada torta and pork chimichanga are fantastic. 

It isn't your usual shredded pork either. It's diced and full of flavor. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"When you first enter the restaurant it puts you in the mind of Roberto's, the food is pretty similar to Roberto's as well. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. They have the station to add to your food with the sauces and peppers, our food was fast and fresh and it was delish. I got my go to meal carne asada chimmie and the husband ventured from the norm and tried their taco salad with carne asada. His food was well prepared and the portions were big, he said he liked that the shell was not overly greasy like other places he tried. My chimmi was cooked to perfection with the perfect balance of meat cheese beans ect. We will visit this place again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nacho. Perfect. 

Seafood soup. Outstanding. 

If you are going to do fast food Mexican In las Vegas...
 do it here."}
{"text":"This is the third FMG I have been to and it did not disappoint!  Friendly and fast service with outstanding carne asada!"}
{"text":"Met up with an old friend who has been banished to Texas.  We share many a found memory of carne asada burritos from our youth.  So when he arrived in town and wanted to grab some grub off the strip, I thought this particular FMG would do.  Having dined at every FSG in Hendo, and having given 4 & 5 stars at everyone of them, I thought again...the particular FSG would do.

After picking up my buddy at Aria it was a quick trip down 7800 block of Rainbow.  Frindly service.  Dos carne asada burritos ordered with everything on them and dos quesadillas...dos drinks.  The service was friendly enough.

MY buddy went to the head and I stood by to pick up the order which came out in quick order.  This was great given...we were the only ones in the place.

I rolled to our table and grabbed my meal and set up my buddies.  Little did I know I was playing carne asada roulette.  I have never..in any other location had a piece of grizzle in ANY of my burritos until this particular evening.  I am happy I stepped on the piece of fat land mine instead of my buddy looking for a quality burrito.  The burrito gods were in his favor.  It could have been an embarrassing experience for me given just how much I was talking up the joint.

Having spit out the nastiness in my napkin, I looked up to see a huge smile on my buddies face.  He was satisfied and the rest of the meal helped bridge the gap of time."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite go to Mexican food place.  Cheap, delicious food with good portions.  I usually get the burritos because they're so filling!  You can't go wrong with one of those.  Carne Asada or one of the breakfast burrito options are a for sure bet"}
{"text":"Breakfast Burritos - Get them here. You may find other \"fancy\" places that put arugula and avocado in their breakfast burritos and charge you $12 per, not here. If you come to Fausto's, you're here for the meat, cheese, and potatoes mixed together in a fresh tortilla to make one huge burrito for under 5 bucks. All you need to do is load up on salsa and get down to business. 

Everything else here; get it, eat it. 

I am a vegas native that now lives in Chicago and is taking Xanax because I can't eat this everyday."}
{"text":"We have now had dinner and breakfast take-out here. Yes we're happy with both the dinner and breakfast. The dinner was awesome! I love the chimichanga, it was like I use to have in Calif. years ago. My said his hubbies combination dinner was out of this world. As for our breakfast burrito's, the chorizo was so tasteful I felt like I was in heaven. You know we will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is typically on par with that of a low price taco shop like another in the area. Like anywhere, it has been better some days then others. Overall the service has been average and the food has been the same. The taco shells were really hard one night, but the tostada impressed. The horchata was refreshing."}
{"text":"I go here about 4-6 times per month.  Burritos are good.  Nachos are good.  One of the best \"hole in the wall\" places I've found.  Better than some of the other Mexican \"Fast Food\" places.  

Beats the heck out of Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Great Fast Food at a low price. They have a wide menu and several daily specials. Their breakfast burritos are better than any big chain restaurant can offer."}
{"text":"Grabbed a takeout feast for two, mixed feelings about the foods we ordered. Prices are low and portions are generous, but most items missed the mark in some way or another. 

NACHOS: Gigantic portion for $8, fairly thin layer of chips with a mountain of toppings.  This was a good value and the shredded chicken and toppings were tasty but the chips themselves were thin and mushy. 
COMBO PLATE; Opted for the chicken enchilada and chile relleno, with sides of rice and beans. The enchilada sauce was perfect and the chile relleno was pretty good but the beans were bland and enchilada was falling apart. 
BURRITO: This monster was the size of my forearm, opted the lengua. Meat was super tender and there was a generous amount inside, but I was disappointed to see just meat, rice, and onions as the filling. This was disappointingly plain and boring even when adding salsa. 

This spot is a great value but sticking to the more Americanized offerings seems to yield better results."}
{"text":"Popped in when the wait at Chile Verde Express was way more than I was willing to wait for a California burrito. Location is small but clean, menu pretty similar to a Robertos but with a few more specials ($3 chicken burrito was on special by the register). Regular prices are on the low side, too.

Got the Vegas Burrito- which is what other spots call a California Burrito, with protein, guac, sour cream, cheese, and French fries. Confusingly, they also have a CA burrito listed, but it's with rice instead of fries, which sounds like a standard burrito to me. Food was fine, good size, asada was a bit chewy but flavorful, wasn't asked my meat preference (lengua).

They have a salsa bar in the back with the pickled veggies and three salsas: the thick red was my favorite, followed by the verde, last being the orange. Food came out quick. 35 cent fee for using credit cards."}
{"text":"We were in there a couple times and I don't feel like I will go back, it was hot inside it appeared as if there air-condition was either not working properly or they just didn't want to cool down the place. My son really likes their burritos however I am definitely not a fan of their burritos, the attitude of the employees is great and they have very good attitudes and are welcoming but the food and the level of comfort eating inside  is just uncomfortable and hot ....a problem for me"}
{"text":"They have very good taco shop food. They are the only place I can find in Vegas that will make me, potatoe rolled tacos. If your a vegetarian this is a great option. The staff is very friendly here and always get the orders correct, even with how complicated my order is. This is my go to taco shop, being from So Cal I am very picky."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it. Judged by the standards of fast food, it's pretty good. Meat's a little tough and chewy, but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great place!!! I recommend the new CHICKEN WINGS w/ fries  and the GRILLED CHICKEN BURRITO!!!!! very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it was soooooo good!  The shredded chicken chimi meal hit the spot!!  It came with a quac/green sauce on top, plus lettuce/veggies, and it. was. BOMB.  Best part?  Guy at the front counter had an impeccable way with customer service!!  So kind, polite, friendly, and awesome!  Didn't catch his name, but I did drop an extra tip in the jar on the way out.  Will definitely visit again next time we're nearby!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the craving for what I believe hands down is the best \"fast food\" carne asada burrito in the valley is more than I can stand.

I try to resist because I know that I will load it up with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo.  Aside from the pico and avocado I know that everything in large quantities is going to put a hurting on me.

When I do get around to indulging myself, I go to Fausto's. 

Doesn't matter what location be it Horizon & College or Horizon Ridge & Eastern they both taste great!  The only difference is that the Horizon location can be an absolute madhouse while the Horizon Ridge location is always quite when I go.

The carne asada is always tender.  And while my gag reflex has been tested by pieces of grizzle at Robertos, I can based upon experience, confidently chow on a Fausto's burrito as I have yet to find anything nasty in it.

Another comfort is that it is not laden with greasy residue it's cooked in and will not blow out the bottom of the burrito as you approach the end of it.  Nor will it leak through the wrapper all over your shirt.

When I am in the carne asada feeding frenzy state of mind I can't seem to branch out to the other awesome looking combination plates they sell.

I digress.  I have had the carne asada fries which simply cannot be matched by other impostors.

 Don't be fooled by the pepsi products.  They have Coke in a bottle behind the counter.

Great food and great price."}
{"text":"I guess it's my fault for getting enchiladas here. I think this place is only good if you are really drunk and need something carby/fatty to soak up the alcohol. I'd go somewhere else for mexican food. But the workers are nice!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Always great food, good value, clean and comfortable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love their taco salad with carne asada!  Their breakfast burritos are great too - generously sized that for a small eater like me, it could be both breakfast and lunch on the same day! Affordably priced and close to home.  Have been recommending this to family and friends since I first tried it in '07"}
{"text":"One thing I hate about Fausto's...they are not in Reno. After 14 years in Henderson, we left to head north. For me, and I know peoples opinion of what good Mexican food is, is varied, but I love this place. It is the high-bar of what good Mexican food is in fact. I have tried almost everything on their menu and cannot fault anything. I don't even have a favorite. It's all...that good. The atmosphere is basically fast-food, although everything is cooked to order. I miss you Fausto's .Please come to Reno."}
{"text":"I love this location!! The portions are super big!! There is one closer to my house but the portions are not the same so I drive here to eat Yummy!! Thank you Staff"}
{"text":"Great place lots of good food and it's nice and fast always love coming here ! Plus the staff is friendly thanks for the bomb good guys"}
{"text":"It's cheaper and cleaner than most Amigos and Roberto's. Oh, and the food is better (Enough said)."}
{"text":"My quest for the perfect nachos has officially ended and Fausto's is the winner!  The super nachos are loaded with carne asada, refried beans, shredded cheese, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, onions and your choice of different salsas.  Fausto's Mexican Grill is a no frills restaurant located in a strip mall.  There is a huge menu with pictures on the wall when you walk in.  Each combo looks better than the next.  Prices are great too.  $7.50 for super nachos that are enough to share.  Winner winner nacho dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is better than any Roberto's I have been to. The staff is friendlier, and their carne asada is leaner as well. I don't find my self having to spit out fatty pieces after every bite of their burritos. The \"salad\" bar is always fresh and tidy, and the inside dining area is always clean. Minus 1 star for only being open until 11p and making me drive to Amigos Tacos for my after clubbing drunken Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around! Nachos, steak burritos, and schreded beef tacos are all noticably superior than Roberto's (which are also good) and ridiculously better than \"Nacho Daddy's (IMHO)"}
{"text":"Why am I the only person concerned about the use of styrofoam? Everything. And flimsy plastic ware that I couldn't even cut my burrito. Menu on the wall, order at counter and they yell out your order... better for take out. Very bare bones.  Ample portions. Good salsas at a help yourself counter."}
{"text":"So far, the best Mexican joint in my opinion. Bought a pastor burrito and carne asada fries for right under $12. For its large portions, you can't bargain or argue its size and value. The pastor burrito was delicious. Very stuffing and huge. Not too greasy either(all Mexican food has grease). The asada fries were damn good as well. I was surprised at how cheap yet how much they served for what I paid for. Unbelievably, I finished my meal, resulting in a dying coma. Also had its complimentary bar of condiments consisting of Jalapenos and various hot sauces. The only improvement they need is the guacamole. But I don't take any stars away because I really can't argue its value. Fausto's will definitely be seeing future business from me.

4/2/12

After trying different options in the menu such as the burritos whether it be pollo or asada, I'm sad to say the burritos are very bad... Despite the delicious super fries that they offer, their burritos taste extremely stale. We asked for extra guacamole and didn't get it, but the lack of extra guacamole doesn't explain the stale taste in their burrito. I suggest to stick with super fries."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight and wasn't impressed...their tamales are very dry...rice and beans nothing special!  Quantity but not quality food.  I wouldn't go again!"}
{"text":"We fed an entire volleyball team with no complaints. Enchilada sauce was very good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Fausto's for a few years now and it has been my number one choice to satisfy my Mexican food cravings. This location is nearby which is convenient. It's a quaint little joint much like the other Mexican grills and eateries around town. The service is quick and friendly and the food is always good. Their portions are SOMETIMES inconsistent but that's never stopped me from returning. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, Fausto's never disappoints. 

If you're not too sure of what to get, my top choices consist of the following:

Carnitas Plate

California Burrito (Stuffed Fries) - The main reason I'm reviewing this place. Carne Asada burrito packed with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and French fries. Simple but easily the best. 

Breakfast Burritos - Solid choice any time of the day. Bacon, Ham, Chorizo, and Steak options. 

Fish Tacos - Not the best, but they'll do! A cut of fried fish with the usual toppings. 

And of course, the Carne Asada Fries!

Also, be sure to take full advantage of their salsa bar! Limes, pickled jalape√±os/carrots, and 3 types of sauces to perfectly pair with your meal. Happy Eats!"}

{"text":"so good we eat there once a week! great food , and filling. No place is better to take a group of teenage boys after football practice . I love everything I have tried there except for the rolled tacos , they are pretty hard and not much filling. 
carne asada fries and nachos are the best!"}
{"text":"Okay, went back to this restaurant after a couple months and it was back to the way it was before - great food value, clean, customer service back on point. We must've entered into an alternate universe during the previous visit - review below - just weird.
----------------------
Uh-oh... Was there a recent change of ownership? This place was our fave go-to Mexican restaurant - great value for great food. Yesterday we went after a couple of months of not going and saw several things that point to different ownership. First, we did not recognize the staff and the one woman who took our order seemed either pissed off for some reason or in pain. She took my order several feet from the counter which confused me at the same time she was kinda snarling. 

Second, the place was filthy. Usually, we see staff constantly cleaning. Third and the saddest part, the food was sub-par. The taquitos were about 2/3's the size of what I'm used to and barely edible. My hubby's breakfast burrito had egg shells in it.

Since it was a holiday weekend we're hoping the owners/staff we're used to were maybe on vacation. We decided to try another time but if it's more of the same - we will no longer be Fausto fans."}
{"text":"I prefer the location at College Dr over this one. The cooks are sloppy with there food. Last two times I ordered a California Burrito, and had to constantly pick gristle out.
Also I do not appreciate the cashier always giving us a hard time when ordering. And the cooks like to stare over at you once seated. 
Overall, I rather use more gas to go to the other one than this one."}
{"text":"best burritos in las vegas. nevada burrito with sour cream :)"}
{"text":"Yum-E!!! I very much enjoyed my carne asada burrito... FULL of carne asada!  Usually when I order a carne asada burrito it's falling apart and I can't put it down without risking having to re-wrap whatever's left of the devastating carne avalanche.  

The grilled asada tastes really fresh & there are no beans in this particular burrito which is A-OK with me.  I don't mind the beans, but faustos does an excellent job puttin the right amount  of ingredients to compliment and not overwhelm the burrito.  

I've also had the carne asada fries which is plenty for maybe 2-3 ppl. 

I had takeout-  so I didn't actually eat here, but when I went to pick up my food it was still fresh and warm.  It's a small place that has about maybe 6-8 booths good for 4 ppl.  


I've yet to try more from this place.. but per my bffs Michelle E's review... I think i'll be trying the chimichangas someday.  

I'll be back Fausto's!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Fausto's Mexican Grill to see how it stacks up to Roberto's. It wasn't bad. They have an extensive menu to choose from. I tried a chicken soft taco combo that was pretty decent. I LOVE frijoles and these weren't bad either. It's a keeper for nearby, quick, and inexpensive Mexican food when the craving strikes me, which is often...heehee."}
{"text":"Between Vegas' famous taco boys Roberto,  Don Tortaco and Fausto, Fausto takes the win. Fausto's quality just tastes better. Not as salty, not as bland. Food looks better too. Service is quick. And this location hasn't disappointed, neither in food, service or restaurant quality. Absolutely, Fausto over the other boys."}
{"text":"Most Mexican restaurants will add an item on their menu just because it is a typical mexican staple, take for example the fish taco from Fausto's, which i have to say is not a good addition to their menu because i got a bland flavor even with the garnishes and sauces combined, but it's there and it's disappointing because it is the first meal that i have with them. I thought the rice and beans would win me over but it did not, again nothing texturally and flavorly special about it.

My baseline for a good Mexican restaurant is STILL Moreno's from Chandler, Arizona. They don't have a lot on their menu but the ones they have are authentically good. 

One dish is not a good measuring stick to rate a restaurant; i have yet to have a favorite from Fausto's, so i'll probably try them again soon because they are close from my house and they have a clean facility with friendly staff. In the meantime, two stars."}
{"text":"(review is for breakfast only)

Fausto's is a hole in the wall taqueria.  Which isn't to say that they do a bad job (see the four stars above)--just that it's quick, tasty and not the healthiest thing you'll ever order.  

We went there for breakfast to grab a quick breakfast burrito before hitting the road and they wrap up a pretty delicious breakfast burrito.  The tortilla is fresh and packed with potatoes, eggs, cheese and, if you're a meat eater, a choice of meat (thick cut bacon, chorizo (spicy sausage), steak).  Oh man, that bacon is good--crispy and a little tough, which adds wonderful texture  alongside the softer ingredients.

On its own, the burrito would make Fausto's worth a breakfast visit (i.e. three stars), but their salsa alone earns the place a fourth star.  Many taquerias have a salsa bar put out for customers to add some flavor, but Fausto's salsa is wonderfully spicy.  The salsa verde has some good kick.  You'd think that's common in a Southwestern town filled with Mexican restaurants, but a lot of places dial back on the spice.  I love me some jalapenos (with the seeds) in my food and so it was nice to find a taqueria that could send little sparks to the tongue.  Add in a tray of free pickled carrots, onions and jalapenos and Fausto's gets my thumbs up as a good breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada tacos in the LV valley! I've been searching for years to find Mexican food that comes the closest to the way my grandmother makes it. Sadly to say, I just can't find it, but along the way I've discovered a lot of great places. Fausto's is a small store with BIG taste. You may believe that you can find similar at Roberto's, although I love Roberto's I believe Fausto's is better and has more of  a homemade style feel to its Mexican food. Get place to go at anytime"}
{"text":"Upgraded version of Roberto's. Same menu, taste and price but better service and quality. Roberto's has recently changed their size for shrimp cocktail from 32oz to 22oz (med drink size) which is a lot less than satisfying especially for shrimp cocktail lovers. I'd prefer Frausto's over Roberto's. The service again is a lot more pleasant."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night at 10 p.m. and it was empty, yay! We ordered our food to go, it was ready in 10 minutes and the cashier was friendly. In my opinion, Fausto's is a step up from Roberto's, the quality of food is better and won't give you gas! Haha. They have a salsa bar with green and red salsa, pickled jalapenos/carrots/onions, cucumbers, lemons, etc.

 I went with the rolled chicken taquitos special that comes with beans/rice and a drink. My husband went with the chicken chimichanga, he wanted shredded beef but we were informed that they pre-make their beef with onions in it, so ordering without the onions was not possible, oh wells, the majority of Mexican establishments do that so we were not surprised. We ended up paying around $14 for both our meals so it's pretty cheap to eat here, they do charge $0.35 if you want to use a debit card, so if you're cheap and want to save a few cents, bring cash. 

Everything was great, beans are rice were surprisingly good! My chicken taquitos were a bit on the soggy side, but that's because we drove back home to eat, they were topped with guacamole and shredded cheese. Both the chicken and the guacamole had a good flavor. My husband was satisfied with his meal, he's normally a picky eater. We'd visit again if we get late night Mexican food cravings."}
{"text":"So apparently there is only one Mexican restaurant supplier that only has the blue Pepsi menu board with the white letters, photo board with taco/burrito combo with rice and beans shots, and horchata/jamaica drink fountain because it's awfully strange that Roberto's has the same setup and I can remember these things back in various locations in SoCal.

Appearance aside, I was able to get a decent two taco combo here for seven bucks with rice and beans, and 3 rolled tacos with guac for another three bucks. The shells were nice and crispy like I like them and there was a sufficient amount of marinated shredded beef. Areas where Fausto's and Roberto's differ are hot sauce, Fausto's is spicier and tomatoier, Roberto's is open 24 hours, Fausto's till 11:45 they say. 

So which one do you go with? I'd say by whichever you're closer to, but Fausto's might have the edge if it isn't 2 am, as I like spicier sauce and I have had random \"gifts\" in my food at Roberto's before."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite. Consistent and very good customer service. Also a clean environment. I prefer this over Roberto's."}
{"text":"This place is like an authentic mexican fast food place. Now they do have lot of options beyond your basic burritos and tacos. Rice and beans are usually part of any combo plates you get. I didn't get to try any of the drinks there but i did see the basic soda fountain. Now if your coming here on your lunch break I suggest calling your order in just because it seems to take awhile especially if they are busy. They do have a salsa bar if you would like to some salsa,limes or jalepenos to go. I always like to get a torta de pastor (mexican sandwhich with marianted pork) but this last time I got 2 ceviche tostadas. It had alot of imitation crab and barely any shrimp. Let's just say it wasn't alot in general for the size of the tostada. So I'll be sticking with my usual."}
{"text":"I usually go here every other Wednesday when we go off-site during work.  The place is kept clean & decent in size with tables and chairs appropriate for the mass of hungry customers. Located in a plaza complex by Stephanie it gets a lot of repeat customers.  You can find all the authentic mexican fixings like Roberto's.  The great part though, is Fausto's Mexican Grill isn't shy to pack your food with plenty of filling that will fill you up and then some.  Their Carne Asada Burritos are heavy to the lift.  Feeling like a 5 pounder...(it isn't really...but I am sure you can order one) their burritos are not hollow at all and wont fall to the side like some places if you hold it straight up.  A solid hunk of meal on a wrap would make Tim Allen grunt with a tear of joy!  Prices are reasonable and affordable.  Not the healthiest of food, but with Moderation and excericse like all...this is a treat almost everyone will enjoy.  I would come here more often, except this place isn't as accessible as Roberto's taco shops around the Vegas Valley.

Great stuff though...value and quantity! definitely a recommendation I can make!"}
{"text":"Everything I get her is amazing and it is cheap!  Go for the California burrito, super steak nachos, carne asada taco and al pastor taco.  Everything is good though.  Just get it all."}
{"text":"I have LITERALLY been going here every lunch break for two years and I always love the quick and delicious meal provided"}
{"text":"I found myself at Fausto's after years of deprivation from delicious Mexican food. Their Al Pastor is perfectly seasoned and their carne asada is grilled to perfection. I will go to bed dreaming about the California burrito I had for dinner. They have tongue and menudo for those of you who like traditional taquerias. Do not waste time going anywhere else in Vegas."}
{"text":"Grease, grease, and more grease. 

I come here a lot because it's a 2 minute drive from my work. I always order the same thing, carne asada or lengua tacos, carne asada fries or nachos. Either or.

I never, ever order over the phone. There's always a language barrier and they don't seem to get my order right.

Other than, food comes out quick."}
{"text":"This place has awesome hours, 6a-12a! 

The food is fast and filling, made right then and there! A nice family owned business, I am a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I was excited that there was a Mexican joint that I can walk to. I went there twice for carne asada tacos and california burritos and both times were a sore disappointment. I love gringo Mexican food that's greasy and indigestible but the flavors were horrible. The meat was way too salty and  the salsa was bland and undesirable. They got the gringo tortilla right but everything else simply tasted wrong. Then I was really bummed when I bit into my burrito and there were no fries. Where was the california burrito that I had ordered?! Ah what sadness!"}
{"text":"I find myself at Faustos probably once a week, the atmosphere is great. if you want real Mexican food this is the place to go. it makes Roberto's look like trash. the workers in Faustos are extremely friendly yet kind of hard to understand due to their thick Spanish accents,always happy to help. you can eat a full meal at Faustos for probably around $5 or $6. and trust me they will not sell you short, they will pack your burrito or tacos fat. would recommend 100%."}
{"text":"Love Faustos! I always get the Carne Asada fries. The burritos are pretty tasty as well. 
So much better than Robertos."}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good value for the price! They have an extensive menu so ordering the right thing here is key to good experience. Giving a 3/5 for now until I try more menu items. 

I ordered a super chile verde burrito, but the guy taking my order misheard and gave me a normal burrito (and charged the $6 price, so they didn't mischarge me phew). Should have been a warning when he asked the cooks if they had any chile verde ... because the meat unfortunately was super salty. Also, since it was only rice/beans/ and the chile verde meat, there was nothing to offset the saltiness, so didn't manage to eat more than about half of it. :( 

The Chicken taco salad with small drink special-$7.50 - is pretty good deal and the portion is massive. Not a huge fan of the less thick guac but the chicken itself was pretty solid and if you're into crispy hard taco shells, it's thick and quite good! 


Last tips: 
-Salsa Mexicana, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole can be added for $1 each. Worth it for the burritos imo.
-Free salsa bar and the pickled vegetables. They have plastic bags on the side if u want to take to go too! 
- they charge a small additional fee for using credit cards, so best to bring /pay with cash!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are great, staff is friendly as well. This is probably the best location in town."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast burritos in town. Been coming here for lunch for the last few months and the Carne Asada Tortas are continuously on point. The day to day doesn't not change the taste, very consistent in the flavors. And when you go you have to mix the green and red sauce for ultimate flavor."}
{"text":"This place is tremendously bad.  It's the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life.  No question.  My wife ordered a carnitas burrito.  The pork was awful.  It was overcooked, spongy and slightly green.  Yuck!!  I ordered the beef burrito and cheese enchilada.  The beef was undercooked and tasteless.  The rice was terrible.  The cheese enchilada was bland, and the red sauce tasted like wallpaper paste.  Bland as heck and too thick.  The beans were decent, but not enough to get two stars even.  Many better places in Vegas to eat Mexican food.  Avoid this place at all costs.  I don't get the positive reviews.  It's just terrible.  Never again."}
{"text":"We love the breakfast burritos and tonight we came here for dinner. Omg huge! 
You can't go wrong at all and way better than Roberts.  Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"This place is a better value and better tasting than Roberto's (sorry Roberto's faithful.)  You get more food for less money and the food has better flavors and looks more appetizing.  I usually get the two enchiladas special, one shredded beef and one chicken with verde sauce.  They really pile on the cheese at Fausto's whether you dine in or get it to go.  I've noticed that some places will skimp on your to go orders...not the case here.

The only one negative is the lack of it being open 24 hours...not a biggie but I believe that's truly the only appeal of Roberto's.  Drunks wanting food at 4am settling for average Mexican fare.  Fausto's is my Mexican fast food joint and has consistently left me with a satisfied tummy...no ill effects the morning after."}
{"text":"I like their al pastor taccos, chicken tacos and carne asada nachos. So if you want good mexican food you'll be satisfied here."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place, heard it was great from multiple people. The workers were nice and prices were reasonable, but the quality of the food wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Average, not the best but a good fast food mexican joint of which there is no shortage in this town."}
{"text":"We were hungry and looking for a Jack in the Box.  Never really found it because my friend saw the Fausto's sign and shouted \"Fausto's go Fausto's!!!\". I've never heard of them before but must be good to shout it out like that. It was like any other Mexican restaurant like Roberto's, Don Tortaco, etc, which I do enjoy, cheap, fast, very filling, and perfect when drinking or recovering. 

We ordered a few burritos. Being only about $5 you can't go wrong. The carne asada burrito was my choice just because I don't think I could've ate an entire plate of nachos. It was satisfying and did the spot, delicious and filling definitely.

I saw a sign for menudo and being a chilly Friday night I wanted some but it was only made on Sat and Sun, so maybe next time.

They are clean, fast, and reliable. If you're feeling like Mexican, Fausto's is good especially if its the nearest Mexican around you."}
{"text":"Very decent, quick Mexican food. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered 2 burritos and chips and salsa. Was told they don't have salsa (what?). Waited 15 minutes. Then were told they didn't have the ingredients for one of the burritos. Changed the order to a chili relleno burrito, waited for another 15 minutes. Got chili relleno but no burrito. And definitely paid for the burrito. Have given this place many chances but have never been satisfied and won't be giving them another chance."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. Staff was great, cook was even better. Their al pastor was to die for. I was made aware recently that the staff was leaving and a new crew was coming in. Bummer...anyways decided to give the new crew a try. 

Very unwelcoming, but maybe we were use to the old staff that knew us. Order al pastor and to my surprise. ... it was Carne asada with red sauce. -_-. They put a pinch of cheese on al pastor fries..... probably won't be coming back. Prefer to make the drive to where the old cook left to."}
{"text":"I wanted Mexican food and this was the closes to my house. They have a great selection on food. They have $1 doll tacos on Tuesday but it's only chicken. It was a little too plain for me and it was on a hard shell, I was hoping for a soft taco. I tried their  carne Asada soft taco and it was way better. I also had their plain churro and it was surprisingly soft. 

Restaurant is very clean which is always a plus"}
{"text":"Wow I'm really impressed!!! I'm so glad I gave this place another chance. My last review was terrible, but years ago, and this place has improved greatly. I went in a first thing I noticed was they repainted the walls, which to me was a great sign because then maybe they were under new management. I'm not sure if they are, but my experience was much better this time around.

I went to the register to order and the guy who was the cashier was really kind. The team behind the counter seemed really close knit and worked well together, and quick! They were running around fast and there was only a few customers inside. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with extra cheese, and it only cost $5. Love it!!

I only waited literally 2 minutes for my food. It was done so fast!!! I was so happy cuz I was hungry! Lol so I got home with my food, and it looked so delicious!!! The bacon had a great flavor, not overcooked. The potatoes were delicious and tasted fresh. The eggs were cooked great and the cheese was on point. I usually can't finish it all but I ate the entire thing, it was so good!!!

They are so much better now and I'm definitely going back there often!! So glad!!!"}
{"text":"This use to be good, but the food quality has gone way down. There al pastor ain't real al pastor. It used to be good. Before they changed it. My go to place is now Don Tortaco. We won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Talk about being led astray.  What a dump.  Absolute garbage food.  Sure it is cheap, but would you really pay up for this poor quality?  No soap in the bathroom.  The tables were dirty too.  Yuck!  My cheese wasn't melted and my meat was undercooked.  Everything was cold.  There was a ridiculous amount of sour cream and funky guacamole poured over everything and it is the straight from the 5 gallon bucket kind of sauces.  Never again!"}
{"text":"very good food with an awesome price. the staff memebers are great people too. i left my wallet in the store and i had 400 bucks cash inside it and when i went there the day after to see if i have left it there they gave it back to me. love you guys"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because it's close by..  This is basically a Roberto's but I do find it to be a tad bit better.  I like their beans.  The salsa verde is a bit spicy. The service is good and the food comes out quickly. The sign on the window says they're open from 5am - 12am so I'm assuming they aren't 24 hours."}
{"text":"This is my girlfriends favorite Mexican food place and I finally had It and IT WAS DISGUSTING! I'm Mexican so I know good Mexican food and this was not it. Their horchata gave me a horrible stomach ache and the torta had no flavor beans were cold and the rice tastes like plain old white rice even though it was orange like Mexican rice. I had to smother my torta in salsa for it to taste a little bit better. White people just don't know Mexican food. I recommend pepes tacos"}
{"text":"This was devine. It was hot and full of flavor. I had the 3 rolled combo. Rice, beans and chicken in like a taco roll. It was nice and fresh. I will return asap."}
{"text":"My main location is the one on horizon ridge, but I come here sometimes. It's consistently excellent for this style of mex, order at the counter - workn man's grub IMO. Definitely a staple. Best salsa anywhere. I usually get breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick breakfast burrito? 

I was staying at the Homewood Suites next door and a breakfast burrito sounded good. Found this place on Yelp, grabbed my purse and shoes, and walked on over to order takeout.

The menu is extensive and the food comes pretty quickly. The quality, however, is okay. I ordered 3: bacon, ham, and just eggs/cheese/potato. It could have had a bit more seasoning to the potatoes and the eggs were slightly overcooked. The quantity is of good portion - I are only half and saved the other for the following morning. For $4 a burrito, it seems like an economic way to start the day with something made-to-order."}
{"text":"I have to hold my review at 4 stars just because the facility is kind of a dive...BUT...the food is awesome.  This is a great spot for lunch.  The chicken quesadilla is out of this world!  Tacos and burritos are awesome too.  I would say Fausto's is just a shade better than Roberto's.  Prices are about average and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Move over Robertos, there's a new fast food authentic Mexican spot in the hood, and IT IS WAY BETTER! Don't be fooled when you walk in and think, the same menu/same food. WRONG! Just try the cheese enchilada plate, or California burrito. Shoot even the hot sauce is better. 
If you are looking gourmet, keep driving. But if you are craving that quick, messy, maybe make your stomach hurt but worth it taco, STOP AT FAUSTOS! 
I can eat tacos 24-7. You would swear I had some Hispanic in me somewhere. I like street tacos, white boy tacos, Indian fry bread tacos. It is something I eat on a weekly basis and if the family would allow it I would eat there more. 
I use to be a huge fan of Robertos, but now, I am spoiled and it is hard for me to eat there, knowing there is a fresher, better tasting, and cheaper option. 
Another plus for Faustos, I heard the first year they made it big, the owner bought every team member a truck. I believe it is true because whenever I go to the location by me, the same guy with the same truck is always there! 
Good service. Good Prices. Great food. EAT HERE NOW."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  I got a basic breakfast burrito and there was so much grease on it I could see through the flour tortilla.  The filling was disgusting.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"consistently good food and great prices! I think they are better then Robertos that are all over town. I have eaten at 3 of their locations and prefer the food from the horizon location. They have great salsa, chicken tacos, chili relano, and enchiladas!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here last night for a late night snackarooni! Yeah we had the mean mean munchies!  the salsa bar was on poiiint! Very clean and the staff was so friendly. Al pastor fries were superbmb!!! Thinking of goin back taday!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG OMG

i moved to las vegas for a year from los angeles, and my friend TK took me to this place. he recommended the california burrito, and taking his advice, i bit into the single greatest food item in the whole world. it's as if every sports championship had just been won in my mouth. 

sometimes at night i'm a bit drunk and hungry as hell, and consider for a short time driving through the desert just to visit fausto's. it's amazing."}
{"text":"I had the chili rellano and my husband the grilled chicken burrito.  We thought they were both very good and the rice and beans were delicious.  We were not fans of their famous carne asada fries, but their chips are perfect!  The chips were light but enough strength to hold together while you dipped them in their beans!  Love the carrots and jalape√±o bar, both were pickled all the way through, sour but yummy! My husband asked if we can have it again the very next day, must have left a great impression.  The staff was nice and answered all our questions."}
{"text":"The cashier could not communicate well. :( - of 5 dishes, he got 2 wrong. My dish was completely wrong, even after I corrected him, and another dish had the wrong meat in it. Further, the taco shell was a bit over done/burnt tasting."}
{"text":"Awesome food & taco Tuesday deals. Very nice staff & quality food . Cleanliness & organized. Would definitely come back. The carne tacos are a decent really size as to most restaurants they're tiny. Very good !!"}
{"text":"If its not Roberto's its Fausto's.

I love you Fausto, don't stop feeding us.

Ordered the California burrito, BEAUTIFUL.
Ordered the Super Nachos, (THEY PACK IT UP) YESSSS

smiles on their faces and very welcoming.

always coming back for more ;)"}
{"text":"Good mexican food.  Great prices.  Had the al pastor burrito and a soda for $6.  Pastor meet was good and the burrito was a good two fisted size.  Everything was seasoned and spiced right. Two types of salsa at the bar were good also.  Fast service.  Great spot for a quick lunch.  The place was pretty busy but service was still fast."}
{"text":"My husband and i moved to las vegas from san diego a few months ago. If u know San diego, then u know they have the BEST Mexican food in the country! We have been searching for a good Mexican spot around here but always end up disappointed. Until last week - when my husband calls me to tell me that he found the  place!!!! 

Let's just say... we have LITERALLY eaten here every day since! Our burrito of choice - Nevada burrito! (For those of u from SD, it's actually a Cali burrito) comes with Carne asada, cheese, sour cream & french fries. 

Me: What do u think it is that makes this place so good? Do u think its the salsa? (They're light brown salsa is so fresh & delicious! Absolutely perfect)
Husband: I don't know. Maybe it's the way the fries are cooked just perfect enough that they're soft inside & crispy on the outside then mixed with the sour cream. Or maybe it's the tenderness of the meat and how it melts in ur mouth. Or maybe it's a harmonious dance party in my mouth.
Me: whoa.

Looks like I should get him to start yelping!"}
{"text":"Authentic hole in the wall. Best breakfast burrito I've had since I can remember. A little hard to find, the sign isn't very legible, but dank food."}
{"text":"fausto's is my choice of mexican taco shop! carne asada fries are crispy and the toppings don't have beans! the guac is fresher! and no tomatoes. fries, carne, guac, cheese, sour cream and i think thats about it. but its not overly topped with other ingrediants like other taco shops. their cali burrito is just as good but with rice and wrapped in a tortilla. be prepared to share due to big portions! they keep the restaurant as clean as they can, the staff is super friendly and patient with any questions you have about their menu. i ususally take orders for takeout and enjoy my mexifood where its not so busy."}
{"text":"Pros: Big burrito. Nice staff. 
Cons: Most plain Jane burrito that doesn't fill you up. Seems clean but not my first choice"}
{"text":"Very good tacos I love the orchata,  the carrots and onions I enjoy eating there the place is clean and they give great customer service I highly recommend them.  I'll be going back to try a different dish."}
{"text":"Fausto's is in the same strip mall as Jenni Pho, just down the street (south) from Oyshi Sushi. I've been to this strip mall numerous times but just noticed Fausto's a couple days ago. That can't be good for business... having signs so small that people don't even notice it. But, I'm hoping they'll be around for awhile because they've got some decent and cheap Mexican food. I got a chicken chimichanga combo plate that came w/ rice and beans for $6.75. The size of this thing was huge! It was so much food that it almost made me want to vomit... but in a good way. The outside of it was nice and crispy and they smother half of it in sour cream and the other half in guacamole. The chicken was a little tough, but I wasn't expecting fine-dining quality food anyway. The rice was a little dry and the beans were extra mushy. But for the price and quantity, I'll take it. The inside of the place is nice and clean and the staff was friendly. Good cheap eats."}
{"text":"It did the trick, seemed real authentic to me because the beans were creamy and a soft brown/whitish color. The plate was full with my 2 cheese enchiladas, beans and rice I really was enjoying it until the lady started vacuuming during my meal. I wish she hadn't done that. I was enjoying the TV and the sights of the other patrons and here comes this lady with a vacuum besides I don't think that is the most healthy thing to do while people are eating, I could be wrong. Good food but overall experience, ahhh I'd go somewhere else with no bother."}
{"text":"Wayyy of strip, this was where we stopped by when we craved breakfast burritos on our way back to LA from Vegas,
Chorizo and egg breakfast burrito TOTALLY hit the spot...so big and so tasty. The carne asada fries, which were recommended, were pretty damn good...tons of meat, tons of guac and pretty damn good fries.

I was, however, disappointed with the jamaica. It was so ridiculously watered down, it didn't taste like much at all. Not cool!! But the food was still so good."}
{"text":"Our family eats here almost every week and has been eating here for several years.  Unfortunately tonight, I had a surprise  in my burrito...a little plasticity tasting-will surely be contacting the owner.
The carne asada is great though and we LOVE the tortillas."}
{"text":"It's not the best Mexican food in the world, but it's also not the worst. It's a bit better than average. I usually stick to the carne asada fries because the tacos here aren't that good. The carne asada fries are a good portion and for the price, it definitely ain't that bad. I give it 4 stars because the food okay and the service ain't bad. It's more a quick go to spot if you're craving Mexican food. Don't expect stellar food though."}
{"text":"little mexican place near rainbow and windmill.
So many little mexican like Roberto or Don Chuy around town but Fausto you are goooood!!!
Very glad little shop are blooming on rainbow from 215 & windmill!!! 
We wanted to grab a quick bite and we tried Fausto!
they were having lunch but as soon we walked in they all got up to take care of us.
the kid at the register taking our order was very polite and helpful.
We ordered a beef torta combo and i had 5 yakutia with steak and guacamole!
their red sauce is hot hot hot... i added some salt in it :)
their fries were crunchy and hot and very good :)
$15 for 2 including fountain drinks 
little clean place near home
while we were enjoying our meal more clients walked in which made me happy for them (Fausto's team)
will come back :) thank you for the yummy torta
steak, lettuce, tomato"}
{"text":"I ate a grilled chicken taco salad that was delicious  the taco shell was fresh with a small fountain drink for $7.50. 
Attendant was prompt and it didn't take long to get this meal."}
{"text":"First time to try their foodie....wow I love it especially the Spanish rice omg...very delish! I like the pineapple juice too...just exactly the taste I want...unlike other place, I get sour tummy n yucky taste after drinking. One thing I noticed is the \"not so friendly\" attitude of their gurl cashier..no customer service whatsoever...hmp kind a attitude it's a turn off totally. The business look bad when you have someone working with that kind an attitude. I would have give the resto a total of 5 stars but sorry...the food is good tho but I am not sure if my money is worth spend there when you see staff looking like they do not really want to work so can't even smile and say thank you?! I go find other resto right ;)"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice flavors. Although the last time I went the chicken was very chewy.

2 things:

They didnt have their health grade posted. They had it tucked away behind a counter. It was a B. And the last I went with my husband he waited 10 minutes to order because the guy taking the order was too busy talking to his friend and kept telling him, \"ill be right with you.\" Unproffesional. Because of that, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I loved it .  Very friendly and excellent customers service . Try it once defiantly you will fall in love with theirs foods . Keep it up . You guys deserved this 5 stars . P"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican fast food spot in Las Vegas. I seriously drive out of my way to get some great eats when the fam wants Mexican. I have not been disappointed by anything here as of yet. 

Anything carne asada based from Fausto's is seriously over the top. I have ordered their nachos on multiple occasions and they fill me up every time. The rest of the menu is pretty standard until you taste it. Once you bite into anything that you've ordered from Fausto's for the first time you will ask yourself what took you so long to try it. 

The store is usually full of high school kids just hanging out having a good time. But they are respectful and of no bother to me. Compared to the rest Fausto's is genuinely the best. hahaha kinda corny but oh so true."}
{"text":"Just had a quick cheap dinner date here! Great food and you cant beat the price!!"}
{"text":"Really good, nice service and large menu. They actually have Tostadas soooo yeah, eat here if you want good food at a good price!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but quality has gone down here. My potato bacon and egg burrito was more like mashed potato and egg burrito:-( tried again carne asada was flavorless chicken taquitos tasted old. Seems similar to Robertos now.  I will try the one on horizon maybe better cooks there. If not 4get it I'll cook my Mexican food @ home"}
{"text":"We stopped by here yesterday after passing it a few times during our travels up and down Rainbow Blvd. Actually, we were craving Chili Verde Express, but forgot that they aren't open on Sundays. 

This place is okay. It is probably very much on par with Don Tortaco, but a little pricier for some reason. 

We each ordered our favorites. 

- breakfast burrito, just cheese, potatoes, and eggs

- carne asada nachos

The portion sizes were healthy, as expected. However, the scrambled eggs in the breakfast burrito were a bit runny. It was also pretty greasy. I know this may sound like a rediculous complaint given the nature of what I'm talking about, but CVE manages to do it without all the grease. This definitely took away from the overall taste, in my opinion.

The carne asada nachos was also pretty freakin' massive! The meat was cooked well and tasty. 

All that said, it still wasn't as good as Chili Verde, which is now the measuring stick for these type of places, as far as I'm concerned.

It wasn't bad. It was okay. But at the prices they charge, I can grab Don Tortaco for about the same quality and less money. If I had my choice though, I would just stick with Chili Verde Express as the best of the bunch!

Probably a one and done for me...but its alright...

3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to LV and we've been coming here almost everyday since. We LOVE it. We always get the \"conga\" burrito. With lots of limes, green sauce and of course sour cream. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Mexican food is delicious. No, really, Mexican food will be eaten, on average, 2-3 times a week in my household, mostly because Mexican food is almost always gluten free. There are cross contamination concerns, but if you befriend the restaurant owners/employees, it is amazing what they will do to make sure you aren't vomiting later that night due to gluten poisoning. 

Between my fiance and I, we have eaten half of their menu. Also, compared to other Mexican restaurants, Fausto's [thankfully] lacks the grease factor.After we eat their food we are in food coma, not sitting at the side of the bed with a defibrillator in case the grease travels all the way to our hearts.  My fiance LOVES their burritos. When you ask for everything, you get it all, including pico de gallo, guacamole, rice, beans and whatever meat your heart desires. No extra charge for delicious guacamole? Sign me up! I, on the other hand, am a fan of the tacos. Two steak tacos with everything includes pico de gallo, guacamole and a healthy handful of perfectly cooked carne asada. Add some of their homemade green sauce and DING DING DING!!! We have a winner!!! Did I mention that their food lacks the unnecessary grease factor that haunts my waistline everyday? Good, fresh food without the need for a nap after consumption - love it!

However, I think our favorite dish so far is their SUPER NACHOS!!! I capitalize the name of this dish because holy freaking incredible, I love their nachos. Homemade fried tortilla chips are on the bottom. Then come the standard refried beans to add a little protein to this mess of a platter. The happiness comes next. In one corner, you have a scoop of slightly spicy (yay jalepenos!) pico de gallo. In the other corner, you have a healthy scoop of sour cream to cool the palette. In the next corner, a SIZEABLE portion of their homemade guacamole and then in the last corner that delicious guacamole mixes with another small serving of pico de gallo. As if that wasn't enough, they then add a little more guacamole here and there right before [happily] drowning the above ingredients with that savory carne asada (or chicken, pork, etc). Throw on some Mexican cheese and cheddar cheese and BAM!!! You have a meal of champions. No fake cheese sauce (save that for the ball parks), no unnecessary lumps of melted cheese that mask all other flavors of the dish, no grease, just simple, delicious nachos. They are hard to find and do without going over the top, and thankfully Fausto's does them right.

So stop by some time or call-in an order ahead of time to bring it home after a long day at work, because for Vegas, it is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area and it makes my tummy nice and plump with Mexican food happiness."}
{"text":"Always my #1 got to over 16 years Fast and fresh. The salsa bar is constantly being cleaned and changed out to remain fresh. You can't go wrong here. The portions are huge and the prices are excellent. If you LOVE authentic Mexican food! This is the spot"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since freshman year at foothill high school (2008) and always been impressed . Only place I've found that will add French fries inside a burrito / quesadilla . I recommend the bean and cheese , or anything carne Asada . 

Shoutout to the woman who is always working the front , she now knows my order as the usual . Once accused her of forgetting a burrito in my takeout order but it was actually in my car . It slipped out of the bag . Sorry about that ! 

Definitely better than Robertos , and cheaper than eating out at a \"sit down style \" restaurant . 

Recommend them to the highest ."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and delicious! They have everything you'd expect at a Mexican fast food place, but the service is outstanding and the food is better than you'd expect! Lots of flavor! Salsa is excellent!"}
{"text":"Fausto's greater than Roberto's. 

Is that a hard thing to do? Probably not, but I will be spending my hard earned burrito money here from now on. Just like any solid fast food Mexican joint the wall menu is chock full of classic greasy dishes with most coming in under $8 and offering huge portions.

I went with the Nevada Burrito which is like a Cali burrito, but with sour cream and rice? Look, I'm not fully sure what it was packed with, but it did have tons of tender carne Asada, crispy fries and happiness. This burrito was about 7 inches long and filled me up for a good chunk of the day. Not a bad deal for $6. 

You can't go wrong filling up at the sauce station. I recommend loading up on the red sauce, it's ridiculous. 

Chicken Quesadilla. You're next on my Fausto's bucket list."}
{"text":"I always call in my orders and they are always ready to go and on point. 

Staff is very friendly, salsa bar is always fresh. Even when I don't call in my orders there is never a very long wait time. 

Personally I have always been a fan of Faustos more than Roberto's  I find it to be more authentic and have better recipes. Some would say they are the same but I beg to differ.

Convenient location. Recommended"}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries are delicious and big portion at a decent price. tacos are good and reasonably price. better than Roberto's or Don Tortaco"}
{"text":"Good stuff, a real non-chain Mexican food joint. The chile relleno was one of the best ever & the al pastor tacos too - genuine shepherd-style carne. Quick in & out place; decent prices, clean, small but nice salsa bar. My single wish: true aguas fresca (they have the instant mix stuff, meh), but they do carry a good selection of Mexican sodas, including apple & the strange but delicious no-alcohol carbonated sangria.

Great place, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been coming here for two years now.  Their food is always delicious, we are big fans of their fausto breakfast burritos and tacos.  I've never had an issue with their food or customer service.

Their customer service is always great, I train guest service standards on the strip that correlate with that of Forbes and Triple A and faustos is on point.

Thank you for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"The ONLY fausto's location I will eat at in the Las Vegas valley. I'm rating it 4 stars mainly because the size of the burrito has gone down over the years, unfortunately. I visit this  location on occasion and i have for over 10 years. Tonight was the very first time that I have ever tried their chicken quesadilla, and let me tell you... it was the best quesadilla I've ever had in my entire life. Ask for onions, peppers, and chicken in the quesadilla (there is no extra charge). The only downfall to the quesadilla is the fact that it is $6.50. To me, for a quesadilla, that's a bit pricey. But I promise, it is so worth it. Did I mention that their fries are super good and only $2.50 for a heaping plate? :)"}
{"text":"I was disappointed this visit, not once but twice.  I ordered Carne asada fries ($7.50).  When I got my food I was annoyed it had hardly any cheese or meat for that matter.  I finished that order & went back up because I was still hungry.  I ordered the Steak & Egg burrito ($5.75).  It was okay,  I was here Thursday morning around 10 am, the guys cooking must of hooked me up because that steak & egg burrito was bomb. It was tasty with seasoned beef & had a good amount of cheese, today however it was bland.  After eating I happen to notice how filthy the baseboards & ceiling looked.  I told the cashier my food was for here so both times she gave it to me in takeout bags... which made it feel unwelcoming even more.

 I'd rather go to the location on Horizon Ridge. The staff was much friendlier,  food was amazing & very clean. I came here because I live on Robindale, this was closer never again..  I took pictures on this visit too."}
{"text":"This blows Roberto's taco shop or of the water,  I thought it tasted much better and it was seasoned well.  My new favorite thing in the works is the Nevada Burrito.  It came with fries, carne asada, cheese & sour cream for $5.75.  You can't beat that price for how juicy & cheesy it was.  So good.

Great staff, very clean when we walked in around 1 PM on a Monday.  I had to eat before going to Desert Radiology up the street. I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I do pilgrimages to this place.  The food is very tasty.  If your craving Mexican fast food, this is the place.  I like to order their carne asada burritos...Good Stuff!"}
{"text":"Not understanding the \"greasy\" comment from June because it certainly is not.  Ordered a California burrito and was disappointed that it did not have fries in it. In CA, we put fries in our California burritos... that's one of its traits!  I will let it slide this time because the food otherwise reminded me of the food back home.  The other ingredients were all in proper proportion.  The carne seemed a little dry, but the rice was delicious!  Service was fast and friendly.  Prices were quite reasonable.  I will definitely give Fausto's another try."}
{"text":"Looking for a good place to go when you're craving authentic Mexican food but don't want to pay high prices at some Mexican sit-down restaurant or pay really cheap prices for questionable Mexican fare at a fast-food establishment? Search no further because Fausto's is that place plus more. The employees are nice, the food is made-to-order, the menu is simple and inexpensive, and there's a complimentary condiments bar complete with pickled veggies (jalapenos, carrots & onions), fresh cucumber & radish slices, and two types of salsa (mild tomatillo & a spicy red salsa). Sure, the ambiance may be lacking, but that's okay because you can just order your food to-go. You can order food a la carte (located on the menu above the counter) or you can order a combo which comes with an entree and sides of Mexican-style rice & refried beans. The combo menu is posted on the side wall adjacent to the counter, and it is composed of images of the food, making it easier to choose what you want to eat. I've been here multiple times, and everything that I have ordered so far has been good. Here's what I've ordered:

Chimichanga combo plate: A humongous flour tortilla burrito stuffed with shredded beef, onions & bell peppers, then fried to golden perfection and topped with sour cream on one half & guacamole on the other, along with a nice layer of melted cheese. The plate comes with a side of rice & refried beans, as well as a small serving of pico de gallo ( I assume to bring some sort of healthy to the dish). 

Shredded Beef combo plate: The shredded beef is the same concoction as the shredded beef inside the chimichanga, but instead of it being encased in a fried tortilla, the meat is served all by itself with sides of refried beans & rice, and your choice of freshly made corn or flour tortillas, which you can use to make mini burritos. The tortillas are wrapped in foil to keep warm. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn because they have better texture, are bigger & taste better. Store-bought flour tortillas can't compare to the fresh-made tortillas at Fausto's. 

Super Nachos: Heart-attack on a plate! But so addicting & super good. I usually ask for the toppings (meat of your choice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes & cheese; I may be forgetting something) on the side to prevent the fried flour tortilla chips from becoming soft. The chips are oily and they layer on the toppings, so be warned- Addicting, yet so bad for you. 

Tacos: I love the tacos because of the way Fausto's prepares the shell. I think they fry the whole taco after stuffing the tortilla with meat & cheese, resulting in a very crispy shell. They then take the fried taco and add lettuce & a another type of cheese (crumbly, reminiscent of feta). I like to add salsa to the taco, which makes the taco juicy & yummy. 

I haven't had a bad experience with Fausto's yet, so I do recommend this place. The next time you're searching for good Mexican food at inexpensive prices and large portions, then stop by Fausto's and try some of their menu items."}
{"text":"decent mexican fast food. cheap price. the california burrito doesn't have french fries in it, but i really like the flavor. i highly suggest the california burrito"}
{"text":"Cool new Mexican restaurant. I enjoyed a vegetarian burrito with alot of green sauce! Came up to be around ~$7"}
{"text":"I find it odd that its smack-dab in the middle of a retail center consisting of furniture stores. Anyway, Fausto's is a decent Mexican restaurant in Henderson, which is pretty rare to find in the short time I stayed out there. It has to be pretty decent if its open until midnight on daily basis. Kinda rare to find a place like that in Henderson that's open this late, well except for the casinos, fast food joints, and maybe a Denny's. 

3 stars for being open late and for carrying carne asada fries. The burritos aren't too expensive, but adding beans and rice are extra. Stock up on salsa at the salsa bar while you wait for your food. Other than that, I don't have too much to add. Yessir."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I didnt feel it was necessarily better than Robertos, its comparable. However I liked the atmosphere much better. Very good service, friendly staff, we hung out a bit after eating with our daughter and watched some soccer that was on tv and didn't feel rushed out at all."}
{"text":"Living in CA for 28 years I developed an affinity for good Carne Asada Burritos.  I had been here once before and was excited to give them another try.  I got the Carne Asada Super Burrito.  It was perfect.  It is a 1/3 larger than other places burritos with a cost of $8.  I was stuffed after finishing it.
   It was so good I could stop eating it,  filled with lots of Carne Asada, cheese, rice, bean, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  I was so happy with my choice and look forward to the next Super Burrito.   The wife got the Carne Asada Rolled Tacos and they were really good.  The five rolled tacos were topped with lots of Carne Asada, lettuce, salsa and cheese.  
   The customer service was great.  Super friendly and got out order to us quick.  The green salsa and jalape√±o carrots and a great addition to their food.  Great food and good prices - what more could you ask for..."}
{"text":"Faustos is da bomb diggity! Quick, friendly service (always) with yummy salsa & guac plus some consistently great Mexican fast food. This is their best location imho."}
{"text":"Servicable mexiican fare.  Robertos is better though."}
{"text":"Nasty!! Big fat guy in the back eating while taking your order.. this place is disgusting.."}
{"text":"I still haven't found a place that offers the same quality Mexican food as I had grown used to back home (California) but this place is pretty decent. Asada chimichanga is huge and could easily feed 2. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff and the place was very clean 1,000 times better than any Robertos tacos recommend anything on the menu"}
{"text":"***Management please read this***
Has there been an employee change here? Maybe employee moral problem? Someone needs to check this out especially quality control.
 I have always loved the food here...consistent and good plus fast efficient service. However my last two visits were not good. On 4/21/18 in the morning I ordered (to go) a breakfast burrito. When I opened it it didn't look like something Fausto even makes. When I tasted it it tasted nothing like the breakfast burritos I have gotten here for years. Actually it tasted like the food was spoiled especially the eggs so I tossed it. Okay things happen and no one is perfect so I went back for my other usual grilled chicken burrito on 4/23/18. This time the chicken was extremely dry and the chicken tasted old and borderline spoiled just like the breakfast burrito. This too I obviously tossed. Very surprised and disappointed. I hope management rectifies this situation. Needless to say I will be getting my food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fausto's never disappoints!  In this town that seems to be all about Roberto's, I can definitely say that I'm Team Fausto's.  The food just tastes better, seems fresher and their cheese doesn't smell funny.  I also have to say that it sits better in my tummy, since I know you're dying to know that particular detail."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype behind Fausto's. 

I've tried the Chicken Quesadilla, the Steak Burrito and I've had the chips and salsa and nothing has been particularly impressive to me.

I know the place is just quick and greasy, but I don't even find it as enjoyable as Roberto's, Don Tortaco or Tacos Mexico...which are questionable themselves."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I have grown up in orange county and san diego with a plethora of great Mexican food. 

I came to Fausto's because I had been thinking about Mexican food for a while. I had just moved to the area and heard that this was the best Mexican around. After placing my order for a carne asada breakfast burrito, I took a peek at the salsa bar. I must say that it was fairly disappointing...They did not have any pico de gallo which was a bummer and the other sauces looked meh. 

When I got my burrito, it was so.... small (thats what she said). I expected a little bit more in portion size. In addition, the carne asada was not what I expected. Rather than having a distinct beefy taste, it had the texture/taste of the sausage toppings on a pizza. It tasted like beef, but a little bit off. 

I will try this place a few more times to see if it improves."}
{"text":"Went to Faustos today. Been there many time. Food has always been Great, and really good prices. Couple issues though that will probably prevent me from going back. 1..every time I go there, the same middle aged mexican guy is at the cashier. The guy is rude, doesnt answer questions in a friendly manner, and super piss poor at customer service skills. His face is stone cold and very uninviting. He ruins the eating out experience every time I go there. 2. I ordered some rolled tacos, 5 of them in a combo. You can choose it with either sour cream or guacamole...same price. I asked the rude dude to split the portion of half sour cream and other half guacamole. I didnt ask for Extra..only to split the portion size half and half. No different then if you go to Panda Express and ask for half fried rice and half noodle. This guy just says NO. haha really? You guys cant even accomodate that? So I said whatever. Then I asked for a side of pico de gallo. Ive NEVER been charged for a little cup of this. I live in Southern California part time where taco shops are all over and I frequent them alot. This rude guy tried charging me another dollar. I said thats ridiculous...he replied Nothing free Bro.  I said Im not asking for anything free, but a dollar for a side of salsa?? What a joke. Then he looked at me and said Rolled Tacos and motioned towards the bag. SO i picked it up..looked inside and there were only 3. I told rude guy I ordered 5, he responded thats not your order...why you touch this...and snatched the bag out of my hand like a little lady. So I told him off concerning that..why you look at me and motion my order is ready then? Anyways, I hope the Owner reads this, this rude guy caused you guys to lose a customer today. Why out of all people would you choose a rude person with no customer service skills whatsoever, to cashier?
Yeah Im big on customer service, if I give you my money I want treated with respect and a smile, as that is how I approach people as well. Being greeted with a friendly smile goes a long way. Overall, the prepared food is typical of most other fast mexican food joints. They Dont offer any free chips that I am used to getting at my fav spots. It is like alot of the Southern CA mexican joints that I am used to. However Faustos is seriously lacking in comparison across all categories."}
{"text":"This was probably the last time I will ever go to Fausto's Mexican Grill as I don't really have a reason for visiting Henderson, NV going forward.  I will say these are the best hard shelled tacos in all of Nevada.  Overstuffed with quality beef. Lots of lettuce and cheese.  Just like the west coast Mexican tacos should be.  Always crowded during lunch but the self order and self pick up moves very fast.  Nothing better than a hard shelled taco and a pepsi.  The taquitos are very good too.   I will miss you Faustos"}
{"text":"We have been eating at this Faustos on Stephanie St. for at least 4 times a month for 12 years. I don't know what has changed but the food has been slowly declining for at least last six months. The last straw my sons cheese enchiladas on 9/4/15 was disgusting, he complained of the flavor so my husband and I tried them and they were absolutely rancid. We have been long time loyal customers and will not be back due to decline in your food."}
{"text":"Usually I would give this place 5 stars but today I'm giving 1 star . Here is my reasoning, it only takes one time for someone to dislike your restaurant  . You change one thing and you get one bad review and that one bad review can ruin your whole business .
I'm sorry but you guys changed one thing and I'll never be back I don't care how hungry  I am .
I ordered a Carne asada burrito like I always do and today it had tomatoes  I've never had a Carne asada burrito with tomatoes in it . This one ingredient ruined my whole expiernce and for that I have to part ways with you . Now if you tell your cook he messed up and to cook it the regular  way then Maybe I'll be back .

Visited July 13th 2015 between  1130-noon"}
{"text":"I have indulged in my fair share of Mexican food. My expanding waistline is proof of that. I can honestly say, without a doubt, Fausto's has the best carne asada burrito I have tasted in the Vegas area. With tender carne asada serving as the headliner, the fresh supporting ingredients come together for a flavorful masterpiece matched by no other. The staff was friendly and fast, keeping up with the lunch hour rush. The salsa bar features fresh carrots and the best red sauce this side of the border. Fausto's is by no account conveniently located for me, but well worth the few extra minutes it takes to get there."}
{"text":"I prefer this place over Robertos.  It's near a convenient shopping center in Henderson and they don't play loud mariachi music while I'm here.  They do have a juke box (that is not even on) and soccer is playing on their big flat screen TV.

Enough people come and go, but it never gets too packed.  That's my kind of crowd.  

I usually get the chorizo plate or the carnitas plate.  Plates come with rice, beans, and pico de gallo with some type of guacomole sauce on top.  The carnitas are partially crispy since the skin is included.  Even better with the green sauce from the sauce bar.    

If you are looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant that's a step up from Robertos, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Only place I will ever go when I'm craving carne asada fries !!! Prices are very great. and the food is always amazing :) Me and my family go here all the time !"}
{"text":"I've dined here before and it was very good for the most part.
I don't know why, but I havn't been back in years.
My last visit was just a basic order, bean and cheese burrito with rice and a few beef taquitos with quacamole.
Taquitos were tiny and the meat inside wasn't good and tasted fatty. Beans and rice were bland and just plain tasting.

I saw a Chicken Chimichanga go by and it looked good, I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Extremely rude customer service is wack the cashier needs to get a new job cause clearly he doesn't know anything about customer service I was a regular but I don't think I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very good burritos. California and Nevada my favorites. Good price and fast service. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved my burrito, and my niece and nephew got the chicken nugget kids meal, they really enjoyed it, when I visit again I will definitely return to explore the menu. Thanks for the great food and customer service."}
{"text":"There is not a place better then Faustos for the price and food is great!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent eats, inexpensive prices.

Can't really go wrong with this one."}
{"text":"While attempting to satisfy our late night hunger, my girlfriend and I decided to visit Fausto's! 

Fausto's is similar to Roberto's or Don Tortaco, just so you know what to expect. I was craving carne asada friend, but for some reason want them in a burrito. Coincidentally, Fausto's has the Nevada Burrito which is EXACTLY THAT! Carne asada, french fries, cheese, and sour cream all wrapped in a tortilla. 

The Nevada Burrito is good, although I think a couple modifications would make it great. Next time I go, I'll ask them to go easy on the sour cream, for extra cheese, and for the french fries to be extra crispy; I feel that the texture of hot, crispy French fries would elevate this burrito to a new level.

Overall, Fausto's is a great place to satisfy your midnight munchies. I'd rate the food at about 3.5 stars, but I'm giving an additional half-star for the staff being so fun and upbeat! Give it a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the tastiest and most complete menus of any take-out Mexican restaurant in the Las Vegas area. Fausto's features something that Roberto's does not: Sopas, a thick, delicious, golden deep-fried corn cake topped with your choice of meat (best with grilled chicken, carne asada, el pastor or even chili relleno!) then topped with cheese & lettuce.  $5.00 - 6.00 each and SO good!"}
{"text":"This has become my husband and i early Saturday morning tradition to get their breakfast burritos. Ever since i have tried this place i never go to Robertos anymore. The freshness of the tortilla, cleanliness of the place, just everything all around is good."}
{"text":"The best. 

The staff is also really friendly. Had a couple really good conversations. Very clean too. 

My burrito spot!"}
{"text":"We just moved here from California and we've been looking for some solid Mexican food. Unfortunately, this place did not satisfy our need. The service was very fast but the food was bad. We got the Nevada burrito, California burrito, and the carne asada fries. Nobody finished their meal. Disappointed because it looked pretty good in the pictures and for some reason they gave four stars on yelp. It's a 3 star spot at best don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Being from El Paso, Texas, I know good Mexican food and tacos! Faustos is one of my favorite places here in Vegas! Try their $1 chicken tacos on Tuesdays.....you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is the second Fausto's location we've been to and decided to grab a bite after checking out Castaways Resale Store a few doors down.

The menu is the same as other locations so I ordered one of my favorites, their  Chile Relleno Burrito and we also tried a bowl of Menudo.

The burrito was pretty good, but their menudo is much greasier here than their other locations. A-OK for me, but in no such hurry to return. ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Stopped in to Fausto's after playing at bounce u with my young daughter, cousin and her daughter.
The food was okay! I got a California burrito. It had lots of flavor and was all around pleasant. The reasoning for just 3 stars though is the customer service. Just walking in the door with my daughter and her cousin we were given the look as if they were irritated with the fact that we were bringing kids in. Not a single greeting or anything. The guy taking out order didn't even make eye contact. Bummed because I really wanted to have an all around positive experience."}
{"text":"Dropped from 4 stars to 3 when I ordered what seemed like the normal California Burrito. Unfortunately when I got home, I found out it contained RICE instead of Fries. Who the Hell puts Rice instead of Fries in a California Burrito? What a let down!"}
{"text":"I'm very upset with Fausto's. I've been a loyal customer for years and I had the most terrible experience the other day. I ordered their carne asada fries (which are delicious don't get me wrong) but the man taking my order seemed like he didn't want to be there and took forever to even take my order. After ordering my CARNE asada fries I went to the back to get my drink and I heard the cook yell out my order. So I went to the front grabbed my order and went home. I had to run a couple of errands (sadly) right after ordering my food so I wasn't able to eat it until an hour and a half after, and to my surprise they charged me $9.50 for just FRIES! I was extremely upset, so I decided to call their store and ask them why they didn't make me CARNE asada fries. I called several times and no answer, worst customer experience ever it's like if they don't want their customers to come back. Well, they lost this loyal customer, a customer who goes to their restaurant biweekly. Never again."}
{"text":"For some reason every time I go in to this place for the same exact stuff the pricing is different depending on the staff that takes the order.The self serve salsa station is always a mess.Also they look like your crazy when you ask for rice on a burrito.Umm you ever been to chipotle?!?!? Just do it.They need to get their inconsistent customer service and food quality.The food is good but seriously get food inconsistencies fixed.I have never seen anyone wash their hands or use hand sanitizer after handling money. Rude staff."}
{"text":"Was looking for authentic food and found a place that hit the spot! All of their prices were very reasonable (especially for the burrito). Excellent carne asada"}
{"text":"Good for drunks, teenage boys, or people who suckered friends into a full day of back-breaking yard work but are too cheap to repay them with sushi. Need a filler, fast, and fo' cheap? Fausto's! There are other reasons to go to Faustos. Like, tonight, I simply wanted to overeat.

I recommend the chorizo burrito. It's  $3.75. In a moment I'll add a photo which demonstrates how this burrito is about three inches longer than a cheap, plastic fork. It's 2/3 as fat as a Chipotle burrito. The chorizo, eggs, potatoes and cheese are tightly wrapped in a fresh tortilla that's slightly doughy. Usually it's served in a wrapper with a small pool of orange grease, but not tonight. I planned to eat the whole thing but am proud of myself for leaving almost half of it for lunch tomorrow.

On other occasions I have enjoyed the carne asada burrito, which may be better than the chorizo. But I always get  chorizo because steaky foods are a dime a dozen.

The environment is very clean and designed very well for drunks, teenage boys, and friends who....etc.

I feel like Fausto's deserves five stars because, in its realm of eateries, it's my favorite. But that might diminish the value of my very favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas, Molcajete."}
{"text":"This may be the best Mexican I've had outside of San Diego. Have came here several times on each Vegas trip and ordered a dozen tortillas to go. I like the grilled chicken plate and the Vegas burrito."}
{"text":"Great Mexican fast food. Cheap AND good. Great carne asada tacos, bean burritos, chicken nachos, etc. etc. Huge portions and most items are between $4-$5. Whenever I go to Vegas for the weekend, I stop by for a bite."}
{"text":"I go to this location and the one on rainbow whenever I'm in the mood for Mexican. Hands down the best carne asada fries in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Visiting in area, but definitely would could back! The chili verde was amazing! Taquitos were fresh and not over fried. Great salsa!"}
{"text":"I got the tacos. These are not what you would call traditional street tacos. If you are looking for California or Tijuana style Mexican food this is not it. The tacos are giant and in some cases bigger is not always better. The flavor is OK but the meat is just not cooked right. I am used to actually grilled Carne Asada. I have had better authentic Mexican tacos that I would refer friend to."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for their carnitas burrito with only meat and cheese.  If I'm really hungry, I'll asked for it to be wrapped in 2 tortillas ;)  Definitely hits the spot!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. I am a fan for the non-chain type of places and this place is not a disappointment. 

All of the food is authentic, fresh and very good. Even the kids chicken nuggets are good. I wouldn't say they are as good as Taco's El Gordo but they are still very good and I would go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Great, greasy Mexican food. Good prices! My only complaint would be that I don't love their enchilada sauce, it's okay but not great!"}
{"text":"Always close 20-30 min early. I get off work and drive the extra couple min every time expecting them to be open and they all walk out smiling and laughing. Psh Roberto's is better anyways."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and had amazing burritos with egg, chorizo, potatoes, cheese and I added in cilantro.  Very tasty, great portions and very reasonable cost of $4."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Burrito hands down! It is very simple your meat of choice, potatoes, eggs, cheese in a slightly grilled tortilla. Red Salsa from there bar is perfect on it. I have had other item on there menu, everything else was good but I could eat there Breakfast Burrito any time of day. It is a meal for me."}
{"text":"Let me say Fausto's is awesome all the way around but this location is clean and the staff is friendly but this is by far some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hole in the wall Mexican place. Everything on the menu is super cheap & pretty big. The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because the last time I ate there with my husband, we ordered the usual carne asada burrito with cheese & ended up with really bad food poisoning later that day :/"}
{"text":"This place is were I usually go for good mexican food.. everything here is really on spot! From the amazing Carne asada tacos to the chili rellenos! If your in the area this is definitely the spot for some bomb food!"}
{"text":"Potato Tacos with a sprinkle of potato, small, hardly stuffed with anything, it was a joke. 5 rolled tacos are soggy, it was fried in a rush. Just bad! I'm p'd off. I called, and they were willing to refund me. But I'll just stop going here. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Fast and friendly staff. We will definitely be coming back. Best authentic Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"Workers were kind.  Food is cheap.  I ordered a chicken taco salad which I enjoyed better than what I usually order at Don Tortacos. I didn't like that there was no Sprite or Sierra Mist available for fountain drinks. Other than that this place is good for quick cheap Mexican eats. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Still trying to find a good Mexican Grill....Ordered a Chile Relleno with a Cheese Enchilada combo.....with a Carne Asada Taco and a Carnita Taco as sides. First off beans and rice good...But nobody can mess that up, right? The Chile Relleno was the nastiest I have ever had.....The coating was scrambled eggs and the chile was hard....What the hell was that!...Burn the Chile, remove the skin, stuff it with cheese. dip in flour and beat the heck out of egg whites, coat the chile with the egg whites and fry it....It is easy to make...To top it off, you forgot to give me one of my tacos....I spent 15 bucks with a tip....Boy, I was surprised when I got home..."}
{"text":"This is STILL my favorite go to family style quick excellent Mexican food. Faustian greets you when you walk in the door like your family. No where else in Vegas is it that personalized with food to match"}

We enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas! Been going here since it first opened. Highly recommend."}

{"text":"Don't come here at all bad customer service waiting almost 40min for a chicken burrito"}
{"text":"I am really glad I found this place by searching beef chimichanga on Yelp.  They have a huge selection of fast food Mexican here and everything is fairly cheap.  I had the beef chimichanga and thought it was pretty good; I mean I have had way better.  But for a fast food chain, I was pretty impressed by the quality.  The refried beans and spanish rice were right on the dot; not too salty like most places.  I have yet to try everything else on their menu.  I wish they sold beer here though; that would top it off real good!  But they do have churros!  Yaye! and they're not even stale.  They are crunch and freshly made to order!  I'll be back to try their tacos, enchiladas,and a quick chimichanga! It's real clean up in there too!  You will definitely be satisfied here! Go now if you are craving fast Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food! And all the workers are very nice! Love that they are expanding around town because everyone loves their food so much!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely fast and tasty! Portion sizes are unbelievable. I ordered three taquitos and a quesadilla and wasn't even able to finish the quesadilla. I've seen smaller car tires...this thing was HUGE!! The joint was nearly empty when we got there but filled up quickly. Even so, the good prep pace never slowed. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Although the pricing is very affordable, they load their meat with tons of salt.  I must have drank several cups of water to balance the sodium intake.  I've definitely had bettter."}
{"text":"I wish there was consistent flavor across all locations. I frequent the location on Horizon and college for lunch and they are awesome. I always receive great portions and very flavorful food there. Pricing is phenomenal for the food you get. They have a flavorful menu that would have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Really fast service, and great prices. Like this better than Roberto's for sure.Love the music they play."}
{"text":"Just okay in my opinion.  Went here for lunch today and here's my review:

-Grilled Chicken Burrito:  Pretty good size, but lacked some taste.  The burrito was way too neat.  When you have a carne asada or chicken burrito, you expect a messy situation.  This also means that you are killing it like a mad man.  If it isn't all over the place, it doesn't belong to your face.  Scary when chicken doesn't taste like chicken. 

-Taquitos (Rolled Tacos):  I was disappointed.  Taste like cardboard and believe me, I've eaten cardboard before.  Dry as heck.  

The layout of this restaurant is a bit odd.  Small counter and located towards the front.  If you sit near the back, you may not even know your food is ready.  Ours sat there for awhile until another customer brought it to our attention.  

I'm still searching for a good FF Mexican Restaurant in Vegas and I'm not talking El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell.  For now, Roberto's by my house will just have to do."}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, my expectations for burritos are extremely high; Faustos is the only place in Vegas that meets those expectations."}

Excellent staff. Authentic Mexico music. Also has a jukebox"}
{"text":"Very good place to eat burritos at here 
Employes are very kind and they have skills to cooking food i recommand to try california burritos at here!!"}
{"text":"I'd be a little cautious about eating at a restaurant with a C rating from the health department..."}
{"text":"Tacos aren't small like other places and they give u lots of meat too...highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious quality mexican food. Salsa is excellent. Robertos who?? Wish I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"For me, this is the closest of four Fausto's Mexican Grill locations. It's in a plaza near Henry's American Grill, which is my favorite late night spot. Fausto's has relatively saner hours, so even though I'd had it bookmarked for a really long time, I only managed to show up tonight.

The photo menu of combination plates reminded me strongly of Roberto's for some reason. I didn't get any of those items. Instead, I ordered two different burritos ($4.95 for each of these), and four different sorts of tacos ($2.30 for each of these) as a takeout order for dinner. I got to try some of each.

Off the bat, I had a minor disappointment when I realized that the California burrito did not contain french fries. That's right, they don't have an authentic Americanized Mexican food item. However, they did have Mexican rice and sour cream to go with the beef, and I ended up enjoying it. As for the carne asada burrito had guacamole and carne asada aplenty, and it was pretty good, but I probably will stop ordering it if given a choice since I usually don't get it anyway.

I might give the tacos a try again in the future since the tortillas (one tortilla per taco) were kinda cold by the time that I got to them, but I did enjoy the fillings for what they were. Carne asada (yeah, again) was alright. Machaca was this fantastic mix of shredded beef and egg that I will probably order next time I'm there. Carnitas was essentially diced pork and tasted of pork. Al pastor seemed odd at first since it was more spicy and less sweet (no pineapple even) than what I've tried elsewhere, but I did end up enjoying it. All of the tacos had guacamole included, which justifies the price as long as you're into guacamole tacos.

For those curious about it, the salsa bar (located around the corner from the register) has two salsas, one red and another more brownish. I don't think either of them are spicy. There's also cucumbers, lime wedges, and the carrot / veggie mixture that I usually don't get.

I intend to try the tortas and the carne asada fries in the future. I'll probably be back since it's authentic Mexican and it's a shorter drive for me than other places are.

P.S. You gotta be careful when you do takeout. If you drive too quickly, things might shift inside the containers, kinda like luggage in the overhead compartment. Lopsided tacos are not a pretty sight."}
{"text":"Better Mexican food then Roberto's and better portions. The service is great and helpful. Always like the coctel de camarones there. Wish it was closer to the house."}
{"text":"The carne asada breakfast burrito was fast, hot, and delicious. I'll definitely be thinking about this location when I'm down here in the mornings."}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this place at all!! I tired the Al pastor and asada sopes. 

The asada was pale looking, no color and dry. I spit out half the meat because it was fat I was chewing on.

The Al pastor was mushy and overly seasoned.

The sopes portion was burnt and had chunks of corn it in which made it taste sweet.. not a fan at all.

The toppings on the sopes consisted of the fake prepackaged shredded cheese. Tasted like I had watered down American sour cream. The beans did not taste fresh and out of a rosarita can. 

To drink I had the horchata.. tasted watered down and not homemade. Def came from a package.

This place was worse than Robertos. And if you've ate there you know it is just as far from authentic as taco bell."}
{"text":"Faustos is excellent. Ever time they don't alter. This is my go to place for fast Mexican food. Breakfast burritos fo life's lol"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today!!! It does remind me of Roberto's because of the way things were layed out in the little restaurant, but it was more affordable than Roberto's, and the food is just as good! I had the Carne Asada Fries!! All I gotta say is.....I'LL BE BACK!! Love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We had the breakfast burritos, one chorizo and one bacon. Simple ingredients, but packed with flavor. The tortillas were cooked on the flat grill, which I think really changed the flavor of the whole burrito. I love the fact that they cook to order. I don't mind waiting when I know that my food is that fresh. The addition of the salsa bar, which included sliced limes, was a perfect touch. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I usually love Fausto's but my last experience was horrible.  I called in to order around 11 pm one night.  I know that they close at midnight but there was still plenty of time before they closed.  When I got through, the person taking my order had major attitude and seemed pissed that I even dared to call their store.  I still gave my order anyways.  Once I got to the store they had already put away all the limes and sauces for the night!  It was only around 11:15.  The cashier was even more pissed in person that I was going to pick up my food.  Even my boyfriend noticed his horrible attitude.  We were so afraid that they may have done something to our food since both of their attitudes were so bad.  Luckily our food was still good when we got home.  I hope my next experience is better."}
{"text":"Had to give five stars for the breakfast burito!  This made to order breakfast treat is hands down the best I have ever had. Also, they are huge so I have them cut it have and my wife and share it. Tasty (definately not healthy) treat and under $4.00."}
{"text":"Easily the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. 

The fish taco was a frozen fishstick, I kid you not. They stuck a fishstick in a tortilla. 


There was hair on the burritos.

Yuck Yuck Yuck."}
{"text":"food poisoning. i ordered the chicken burrito and half the stuff that comes with it wasn't even inside. how do you get my order wrong and give me food poisoning at the same time? my bf ordered the california burrito and said it was no where as good as it used to be. friendly staff and clean dining room but that does not make up for the horrible experience i had"}
{"text":"No need to go anywhere else for premium Mexican food!
The Nevada Burrito is incomparable! 
The chili relleno cheese enchilada is genius!
The hard shell shredded beef tacos bring tears of joy!
Great service,  clean restaurant and great location. 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish this was a little closer to me but Its worth the drive. I prefer them over Robert that's for sure. I recommend ordering before arriving if you are on the go."}
{"text":"Rice was ok. For a late Saturday afternoon beans were dry and tasted old in my burrito. Chicken was good but salty and burrito in a whole tasted dry and not that great. I'm from northern CA and have fought all over Mexico and never had something like this. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is really good!  The Ham & Eggs (no potato) breakfast burrito is huge and delicious.
If you want a really quick, large, cheap, tasty meal - this IS the place to go.
Chimichanga is over-bearingly large and good - however I felt guilty eating all that in one sitting."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! The food is always delicious and very affordable! Fast service and the guys are always nice and helpful. Our family of 5 go in hungry and leave full."}
{"text":"I love their chile rellano here.. its always so good. I don't think I've ordered anything else before.  I order it with the enchilada sauce on the side so the rellano doesn't get soggy ... May sound weird but that's just how I like it
I've gone to the three Fausto's near me and the quality of the food they serve remains consistent, always delicious! If you can't decide what to get, you simply tell them what you like and they can suggest something for you or suggest the best combo to give you more value for your dollar. That's great customer service."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with a full menu and a salsa bar. They have specials for certain days where the prices are alot cheaper, but what I order is never on sale.  However, to me their prices are already pretty low.

The carne asada burrito was excellent. You get a good portion size that will leave you stuffed."}
{"text":"We eat at Faustos at least 3 times a week because our dad takes us there after school. It's fast, easy and cheap. We both love their bean and cheese burritos because they are packed full of really tasty refried beans. Their beans have a ton of flavor, unlike other Mexican restaurants we go to. The tostadas are also really good and we wash it down with the horchata or the Jamaica. Yum! It's not fancy, but the food is good, and the guy at the counter is nice and always remembers us."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  They have a huuugee burrito for $6.  Wife had veggie and that was good also.  Asked for pinto beans instead of refried and they had no problem doing it. This place is clean and even though it may feel like Robertos, its 100 times better.  Found my new spot in Vegas for best burritos!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but a $.25 fee to use a credit card? Don't hold your customers responsible for your inability to negotiate a good rate with your credit card processing company."}
{"text":"Its good, cheap, quick down home mexican food!  I love it!!! :]"}
{"text":"This was my go-to place for quick, delicious cheap eats when I lived in Henderson. Absolutely awesome. Authentic, good, quick and great prices. One of the things I miss about living in Henderson.."}
{"text":"in a nutshell..cheap, fast, greasy, which is good and bad, and it has a salsa bar.  whenever i go there, i always see them preparing food, so i feel reassured that the food i always fresh....the only place i go for taquitos or asada fries, for now.."}
{"text":"Always got the carne asada fries. The fries stay crispy for a long time no matter how much guacamole, pico de gallo, or sour cream is on it. The meat taste great and you get enough to keep you full for most of the day. You don't wait too long for it and there haven't been long lines if any, at least the times I have went. Definitely a go to place for me when Im low on cash and need a filling meal."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Carnitas had no flavor at all. Guacamole was blah big waste of money an they need to learn manners us white girls expect respect"}
{"text":"Great \"fast food\" maybe not as fast as taco bell but a million times better. GREAT deal for fresh food. Had the veggi burrito. Can't wait to go back and try different things"}
{"text":"I was starving and in the mood for tacos, fortunately for me Fausto's was right around the corner. Unfortunately I expected too much, when really Fausto's is merely a clone of Roberto's. If I wanted Roberto's I would have gone there and paid slightly less. Same menu, style, quality, lack of care, and customer service. The one thing I was pleasantly surprised with was their red salsa, but aside from that if you have ever been to a Roberto's don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be awesome because it is so close to my house and right next to where I grocery shop. At first I was super excited walking in it had that los angelos mexican feel with the orange and yellow colors and huge menu board. I ordered a Carne asada burrito and it was one of the biggest let downs of my life burned meat the rice was bland and the beans were ok at best. To make it even worse I look up to see that the meat I was eating came from a bucket under the counter! This is sanitation 101 you don't do that ever! Needless to day I will just make the extra drive to rosaritas beach where the food is much better and cleaner it costs a bit more but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love their super nachos, carne asada w everything and I like their California burrito, bacon breakfast burrito is SO good too! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews, though if you read them they're pretty lame ie: someone said \"I'm never coming back to this place because there was tomatoes in their carne asada burrito\" what? That's your criteria for 1 star?

Having lived in San Diego, I have high expectations and the only two restaurants in Las Vegas that lived up to this have been this place and El taqueria el buen pastor--the taco truck over by cashman's field. The other places near here:
Alberto's 
Tacos de Tijuana 
Taco y taco 
Are overpriced too greasy and not that good. 

What I like:
-location near our house
-nice workers 
-open whenever we're needing it!
-Decent salsa bar: they have a nice red and my favorite the green. They have cucumbers and pickled carrots. 
1. The bean and cheese burrito for 2.5
2. The breakfast burrito with potatoes bacon and egg for 3.75.

We come here to watch soccer games and get our mex fix on. 

Hasta manana!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas !!! I love the shrimp cocktail , the carne asada burrito, carne asada sopes, enchiladas , camarones ala diabla , the three different salsas, and the fresh cucumbers to munch on while you wait for your food. It's very clean and the staff are very friendly . I never have to wait a long time for my food. Everything is freshly cooked and very tasty :) if your looking for some real Mexican food, go here! Trust me you won't be disappointed . I've been to a few different places and they charge like crazy but here they have good reasonable prices . There is a lot of parking space so you won't have to be driving around looking for a parking space."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Prices were reasonable and quality was on par.  We liked it but no wow factor."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my food! Compared to other Mexican restaurants they really give you a good portion of food for a very decent price! Definitely will be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's still not 100% what I'm looking for but it's way better then Roberto's or Super Burrito... The carne asada was decent and the guac was pretty good. I am still looking for someone who does a decent chicken burrito, but thats another story. Overall the place it clean and the people are very friendly. This alone sets it apart from the others."}
{"text":"Fausto's is great.  Breakfast burritos are awesome; chimichangas are delicious, tacos very good, if a touch greasy, tortas are good.  The carne asada is good, the chicken is ok (not pollo asada).  The carnitas is quite good.

Salsa is very good.  Spicy carrot & jalapeno bar.  Prices are reasonable.  Service is competent and fast.  This is one of our go-to places for a quick, tasty meal."}
{"text":"This is the third Saturday in a row that I've ordered my burrito from faustos. Each time I've gone to pick it up, I go to the condiments bar to get a side of carrots and the tongs are just laying on top of the food. I told the front person about the tongs and he said \"oh it's okay\". I told him no it is not okay, it is unsanitary. people touch those tongs all day and you just leave them in the food? Needless to say he did nothing about it and went on about his business. I will never order from them again which is too bad because the food is pretty good. But I'm not willing to get sick over it! The health department needs to pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"Great service. I had the pork carnitas, I'm used to having it shredded but it still had good flavor, but also had a lot of fat. I will try it again but I will order something else next time"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday night. The food is here is delicious and well cooked. I ordered the lengua combination and ordered flour tortilla with it which was out of this world. It only took them less than 15 minutes to prepare my dish. I also ordered a large horchata. It tasted almost perfect. This is a small joint, but they offer great food and service! I will be coming back  here again whenever I crave Mexican food. Oh yeah, I left the place very satisfied."}
{"text":"Almost exactly the same as Roberto's, except it's called Fausto's. No major differences of note.

However, if you want a California burrito (fries and carne asada), don't order a California burrito. You'll have to order their Nevada burrito. The California burrito at Fausto's has rice and carne asada. The incorrect burrito naming is a bit blasphemous, but forgiveable because both are delicious."}
{"text":"Carne Asada supernachos, no beans!"}
{"text":"I tried the California burrito. The taste isn't up to par like San Diego(where it originates) but it's better than Roberto's. I would come here again if I'm in the mood for a California burritos."}
{"text":"Greasy on some items but great tasting food!"}
{"text":"Being from California I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to Mexican food.  I've enjoyed a lot of great Mexican food over the years.  My wife got a recommendation from a co-worker to try this place so we decided to go at it.  I ordered the chicken taco & fish taco combo & she had the carne asada combo.  Let me just say this place is on point when it comes to flavor, portion, & price.  The carne asada was flavorful, tender, & not greasy at all, the guacamole added a great creamy touch to the tacos with a nice hint of lime punching through.  The beans were creamy & delicious with a great texture and taste.  The rice was fluffy & soft with a balanced flavor & a hint of tomato.  Overall one of the best fast casual Mexican restaurants I've been to living here.  I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, just like in California. Small shop, great eats. I'm very happy I found this place. I'll be coming back again. Yum ..."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the carne asada fries are better here than Roberto's. Only because the fries stay crunchy longer vs the one at Roberto's. The fries @ Roberto's become soggy quickly. They also serve tamales!!! Which I love!!"}
{"text":"For a chain of \"fast food\" American-Mexican food, it's delicious! Cheap prices, convenient location, and quick service. I appreciate the salsa bar offering red and green salsas, pickled jalape√±os, carrots, and onions, cucumbers, and radishes. The salsas could be better, but I like the flavor of the red salsa adds a nice spice to the food. Service isn't necessarily friendly, but for a two-minute interaction, I don't really care. You order your food at the cashier, you pay, you pick up your food, then you eat. That's it.

This location has only a picture menu with no prices (except the breakfast options). A lot of their items are drenched in (not-so-melted) shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or guacamole, so you've been warned. I simply order my meal without one or all of these toppings and I'm satisfied.

I've only been here a handful of times, but the experience has been consistent. I normally order Carne Asada Fries or Nachos and/or Carne Asada Tacos. I don't normally deviate from these items, but I have had the Breakfast Burrito and Tamales. Everything has been tasty. 

During my visit yesterday, I wanted to see how their Pastor stood up to street vendors, so I ordered two Al Pastor Tacos ($2.30/each) topped with pico de gallo and guacamole. Not too shabby! I was surprised that the pork was so tender and flavorful. Certainly a good alternative to street tacos! Ruben ordered the Chicken Quesadilla Combination Plate ($6.35) that was packed with three very large slices of quesadilla, refried beans, and Mexican rice. The chicken was moist and juicy and there was so much of it! They're not holding back. We also shared Carne Asada Fries ($6.95), always delicious, although they never season their fries, so it just needs a bit of salt. A small drink with unlimited refills is just $1.50 (no lemon-lime soda option) and all prices include sales tax."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from work, and for affordable, good, semi-authentic Mexican food, this is a good bet.  The carne asada, carnitas and cheese burritos are HUGE.  Good, good, good.

The quesadillas are a little tooooooo greasy, but otherwise, its cool when flying on the cheap."}
{"text":"Dear Yelp,

If this is the best Mexican food that Henderson has to offer... Yikes!

Read some reviews boasting about the California burrito here.  Being an avid fan of such burritos, I decided to head over and give it a try.  What I was given was not a California burrito though, it was a regular burrito minus beans and pico.  For those that have never taken a trip to San Diego, a California burrito must contain french fries.  No fries, no Cali burrito.

So after getting over the initial disappointment of no fries, I tore into Faustos (not really) Cali burrito.  The tortilla, which I consider to be the most underrated ingredient of the burrito, was actually pretty good.  Maybe they make it themselves?  Either way, a very solid tortilla.  Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing this burrito had going for it.  The slimy \"guacamole\" looked like the prepackaged junk you buy at Safeway (or Vons as they call it out here), there was too much sour cream, and the entire inside was cold as a dead piece of vagina!  However, I only dropped four bucks, so I can't really complain too much.

As it stands now, I'm thinking Rubio's really is the best burrito out here.  Like I said: yikes.

I give Faustos Mexican Grill #2 a fantastic score of 2 out of 5 stars.

Love,
James"}
{"text":"Tacos Al Pastor is a must! My brother & I crave it all the time!
Menudos... is zero stars... do not order it here."}
{"text":"This was a great find. I had a yummy carne asada burrito for only $4.95. I am stuffed. Good food, clean and friendly staff. I talked to them in Spanish, which was fun for me. 

I was here for a conference at the M Resort and so I just found this place on Yelp and came here because it had good reviews."}
{"text":"Great food, very delicious and authentic.  Workers are very upbeat and make the dining in experience worth it!"}
{"text":"Simple neighborhood taqueria and more. Shrimp cocktail was very fresh and could easily serve 2-3 as an appetiizer. More than a dozen plump, juicy prawns erved in a qt. container with loads of avocado, onions & cilantro. This is Mexican style, the prawns are in a chilled tomato broth (think gazpacho!). You can drink it all, it's very refreshing on a hot day! Next up was the carnitas plate. The meat was tender, not overly wet or dried out, and no extra fat on the meat. Well seasoned and delicious. The generous portions included the option of whole (instead of refried) beans. Free salsa bar includes pickled carrots/Jalape√±os. Nothing fancy here, just straightforward and traditional Mexican fare. Bathrooms are clean though graffiti covered. Recommend!!!! 

To the reviewer who was disappointed not to have fries in his/her CA burrito, with all due respect, this is a traditional Mex menu and cannot be compared with the urban Cali-Mex fare found at CA beach cities. 

Traditional Mexican food is quite healthy (substitute whole beans for refried), the simple combo of beans, rice and (corn) tortilla is a complete meal with no \"vegetable\" needed due to the amazing nutritive value of beans. The sour cream, cheese, flour tortilla stuff is Just added for USA tastes, I skip them when ordering. Thanks and enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for GREAT tasting authentic Mexican food, Fausto's is the place for you. I've never been a fan of the \"football sized burrito\" because I've always felt it was unnecessary and gimmicky. Fausto's portion size is perfect and they will make your food exactly how you want it. It's a reliable, delicious, reasonably priced, and fast source to comfort food. Also, I know most people roll their eyes at the idea of an authentic Mexican restaurant serving french fries, but I've always been in agreement with the philosophy of giving the customer whatever they want. I LOVE fries with my burritos... if one place has them and another does not; then guess where I'll be going! Kudos Amigos! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Eh. If you like eating your food off syrafoam plates with plastic silverware...then this is your place!. It's not bad for a quick in and out street taco. Many Mexican families in there. Seemed to have a good local following which is why I give it 4 stars. The staff was very friendly! Just not the best mex-grill I've ever been to. Greasy. And hard to eat an enchilada with a plastic fork!"}
{"text":"I love this place I get the same thing Every time chicken chimichanga."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  More Mex than Tex.  My wife tried the hot sauce and from the face she made, I didn't touch it!  Too vinegary.  Food was ok.  Ambiance was 10 tables in a store.  For fast food, ok.  For a nice TexMex dinner, look else where."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch when I crave tacos. Their food is fresher & the portions are bigger compared to Robertos. I like this location the best out of the other Fausto's I've been to. I wish they were all the same but unfortunately the one near my house on Rainbow isn't as good as this one. The workers are nice & the wait is never long. I usually order their carne asada fries & rolled beef tacos, so far it has been consistently good. I did try one of their tacos & I'm pretty sure it was the lengua taco, which was so yummy! But when I tried to order one at the Rainbow location they didn't have it there so I'm confused if that's the taco I actually had at this location, LOL."}
{"text":"The only thing I have ever tried is the chille relleno burrito. But it is SO GOOD. So are their salsas. Om nom nom!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Fausto's when I'm around the Henderson area. Delicious authentic Mexican food at a great price! I really recommend the asada fries. I usually get them with just cheese, but they are great with any topping."}
{"text":"Muy bueno! For a regular place to eat, where those that know Mexican Food will go, this is the place for sure!!!!  All the workers and all those that eat Mexican Food as their main ethnic food eat at this place and I would say it is pretty darn good!

1.  Location - There are many, this one is in the Albertson Strip mall next to Panda Express with tons of parking and easy access!

2.  Ambiance - No Frills, This is a clean and basic place to eat!

3.  Food - this is the key. There is a huge picture menu or written menu above the cashier.  We ordered several things for the family:

Nachos - Great stuff and you can get a bunch of toppings on it.

Carne Asada Burrito, Chicken Burrito, Carnitas Burrito - All these we ordered and it was very, very tender meat. The size, while not the largest, was just right.  Everything is cooked to order, not sitting in a try waiting to be \"made\".  We added the sour cream, pico de Gallo, and beans. My kids and family enjoyed it a lot!!!

Cheese Quesadilla - OK, so I have one family member who wants the Big Mac of Mexican Food, a cheese quesadilla. Very nice, thick with cheese and only slightly oiled i the cooking process. 

Stuff - They have a help yourself area to spicy sauces and pickled vegetables. Very nice and authentic. I like a lot of sauce on my food, so helping yourself is great.

If you are used to ordering huge burritos with everything on it and all, then you may be a bit unhappy here. As while large and with many ingredients, it is not overpowering in size or in taste. This is what makes it so tasty.

GK Says, check it out.  Plain, simple, good."}
{"text":"This place makes great food. I said great - what i mean is great tasting, not healthy. The first time I came here I had the menudo which I loved and was a perfect portion and for only $5! (sat/sun only) The 2nd time I came here I had a machaca burrito. this is one of the few places that I've ever been to that you can actually order machca without onions. Everywhere else I go they always say, well.. its already pre-made with onions in it so we cant take them out. Mexican food should never be completely \"pre-made\". That's just not acceptable (yes even Roberto's is included in that)
The 3rd time I came here I ordered the Machaca plate. Now this is where they get one star removed. I had the beans and rice. The beans were thin. yes I know its refried beans but I prefer mine to have more backing to them, as in more beans,less fat. the rice was ok but was kinda bland. My mexican rice has way more flavor than this but all in all it was still good. The machaca was very good flavored (ok lets face it I poured red chile all over it b/c their red chile is one of the my favorites) 

Please note: they also have the super nachos which my bf ordered for himself on one of his trips out there. freakin good. 
oh and b4 i forget they have huaraches. That's how you know its really good mexican food when they have huaraches! 
the bf usually gets their carne asada which is so tender and good. its a must get."}
{"text":"Amazing ! I love this place! I wish they had more closer to me! But it's worth the drive(:"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican food restaurant in town. The sopes are probably one of my favorite meals on the menu. You can choose any meat and any toppings of your choice. I really recommend getting the sope with chicken. It's delicious! Don't eat meat? Get the sope with beans instead and go crazy on the toppings! Equally as delicious! The sopes are homemade and super fresh on Saturdays! If you're willing to give sopes a chance, hurry! They run out quickly!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not a big Mexican food fan and with me being Hispanic I think most of you would think \"What!!!!??!?\" But when I do feel like having Mexican food (which is once in a great while) I think Fausto's blows Roberto's out of the water.

Fausto's just tastes fresher and is less greasier than Roberto's. When I feel like going to have Mexican food from a sit down restaurant try El Torito. The service may be slow but the food is great!

Thanks."}
{"text":"This Fausto's is similar to the one located on Stephanie. Good food at reasonable prices and good portion sizes. The service is quick also. I haven't been to Roberto's ever since we discovered Fausto's through my parents. I just find Roberto's to be very greasy and seeing that is not very appetizing at all.

Try it out and taste the difference, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Food is good, problem is they always mess up the order. Make sure you check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burrito. The tortilla is really good too! They guys are nice too."}
{"text":"So glad we have this place 3 mins from our house! My boyfriend is Mexican & we recently moved from California, so we take our Mexican food pretty seriously! 
The California Burrito is so good that it's been hard to order anything else, but recently tried their tacos & they were delicious! (& good size - generous on the meat)
We also get ceviche pretty often & it always hits the spot.
Looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"So this morning, I was craving a breakfast burrito. Not the kind that you get for 99 cents in a drive through. A real man's breakfast burrito packed with enough meat and potatoes and eggs to help me survive for three days without eating anything else. Fausto's is one of the best breakfast burritos in town. 

For some reason, Roberto's has never made a breakfast burrito worth my time. Their potatoes and onions are consistently undercooked. Sometimes, the cheese might be melted. But Faustos knows how to cook up a decent burrito every time. 

So... You know that moment when you walk in the door ready for the glory of your favorite plate on the menu. You have butterflies of excitement and you can almost taste the marriage of bacon and potatoes and cheese and salsa verde dripping from an enormous tortilla shell. And then..... Everything is derailed by a hunch to get something new. In this case... Chilaquiles. 

I had a chilaquiles in San Francisco at the farmers market at Embarcadeiro that was insanely delicious. Crispy and fresh Tortilla chips, spicy green chili salsa, and a liberal toss of Cotija. Fausto's delivered a soggy wreck of limp chips smothered with a run of the mill green sauce. Doused with sour cream. I'm a little tired of Mexican restaurants obliging the American pallet with sour cream. It's alright but with a heavy hand, it can ruin a dish. This chilaquiles was not very good.

So as I sit here lamenting my choice, I am hearing the sounds of intelligent people roll in and order breakfast burros one after another. And their Friday is going to be great. So far, my day feels pretty ordinary. But next time I will use my brain and get what I came here for and leave a happy happy man. 

Since this place is seeming a one trick pony to me, I'm rating Fausto's 3 stars. With Los Tacos, Taco y Taco and Tacos el Gordo, I don't need to worry about finding a good lunch spot for Mexican. But I'll keep Fausto's in the Rolodex for the occasional breakfast burrito. But chilaquiles... Never more."}
{"text":"Great carne asada plate. Loved the rice and the spicy hot sauce you can get on the side. Reasonably priced and tasty!"}
{"text":"Muy excellente! Came in with my boyfriend and his custom made burrito (rice, beans, asada and shrimp) was \"absolutely fantastic\". I ordered the Las Vegas burrito and it has been the best [california styled] burrito I ever tasted since living in Vegas.  Fausto's Mexican Grill will be our spot going forward! Shout out to Angel for helping us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food by far in las Vegas. I love their veggie burrito and when ate mat the chimichanga couldn't be messed with. the food is sloppy yet organized and the portions could feed a lumberjack."}
{"text":"Faustos, what happened? I used to love this place. I mean, to me this was the best Mexican food in the city. Fausto came from Mexico, by way of Southern California and brought great taste with him. Sadly, the quality has gone a little too far south and I no longer recognize this place. The beans are still good but their Chimichanga was soggy and sloppy. I hope this was more an issue of the cook rather than the franchise however I have eaten at the Stephanie Location and College Dr location and was not impressed. Everything was very greasy and it upset my stomach.... as I was eating it."}
{"text":"Oh lordy lord, I didn't think I'd be coming back so soon. LOL.  Tonight we came on a whim and boy am I glad I did!

This time, I decided to get the Carne Asada Fries which came out to about $8 with tax.  I gotta say, it was delicioso!!  Start with crispy french fries, topped with chunks of seasoned beef, sour cream, guacamole and two types of cheeses.  The great part about it was that I couldn't finish it so I took the rest home and I'm happy that I'll have another meal later!  Such a fulfilling meal and caution to the wise: don't try to be a hero and eat this with your hands.  It'll conquer you!   This must be consumed with a fork!

On another note, when we arrived, there was a line to the door.  Low and behold, there was a lady in front, trying to decide what to get.  I don't think she read my first review for this place.  LOL

On a last note, the front guy that takes your order and your money is really funny.  He doesn't talk much English, but can understand a lot and interacted with us during our visit.  He made us chuckle a couple of times.  While we were eating though, he kept taking pictures and the camera kept facing towards us.  Maybe he was taking a picture of the full restaurant behind us...hmmm....I'm going to say he was being a little creepy! LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Chile Relleno burrito was good all ingredients seemed fresh. Moving just a few days ago from San Diego, I wasn't sure what the Mexican food would be like here in Henderson so I did my research and went in curious to see for myself. I ordered the chile relleno burrito and a tamale/cheese enchilada plate just in case I didn't like the burrito. Well, I ate the burrito which was good and tried the tamale and enchilada which were OK but probably will stick to the burrito for now."}
{"text":"The IN and OUT of mexican food.

Gotta love Fausto's specially their breakfast burrito. You get your money's worth. This thing is HUGE and will make you full all for $4. If ever your on a budget and your craving mexican food go to Fausto's. Their prices are pretty decent and I assure you, you will not be disappointed . I also recommend getting the taquito's and the chicken quesedillia.  And of course for your drink the Horchata. It will satisfy your thirst.

The atmosphere:  I wouldnt count on this place being a fancy sit down. Like i said its good for take outs just a quick grab and go type place.

Location: The location i went to was in henderson and really convenient.

I would highly reccomend this place for people that just want to grab quick mexican food. Don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"My mom had a hankering for rolled tacos. Being that we are originally from San Diego, we have high expectations when it comes to authentic Mexican food. This establishment took my mother's order, beef rolled tacos with guacamole, cheese, sour cream and a side of pico de gallo. The cook took 5 pre rolled tacos out of the freezer, literally dipped them in hot oil for about 3 minutes, packed them up and gave them to my mom. She took one bite and was completely unsatisfied! She said she will never go there again! I personally think that her expectations may have been a little high when it came to this place and it's food. Try it for yourself. My husband didn't have a problem with it. He said they weren't the best, but they weren't bad."}
{"text":"Must say that the entrees are extremely cheap and generous portions.  Expect to pay $6 to $7.  They have a bar available to pick out your sauces and peppers, it's a nice touch.

I ordered the chicken burrito complete meal which includes beans and rice.  It was ok but the biggest minus is that they didn't flavor the chicken meat which is unbelievable!  No wonder they need the sauce bar to give some flavor."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge - 21/100

This one of my favorite Mexican foodie spots in Las Vegas. I've been to all locations within the valley and the food has always been consistently good (at all locations) for as long as I've been here, 16 years. 

And they have THE BEST Carne Asada Fries in Las Vegas. I first tried it in high school or college at the other locations and it's always our go-to since it's located across the street from my friend's house. The portions are HUGE. Fries are cooked to the right texture, not too soggy or greasy and not too crispy. It's loaded with tons of Carne Asada meat, loads of shredded cheese, and if you're taking it to go, they are more than happy to put the guacamole and sour cream on the side. 

For some dishes especially the Chimichanga, it's freshest in the early morning. The shredded chicken in the Chimichanga is tender. Sometimes it's dry during late afternoon or dinner time. But it may have changed since the last time I got it. 

Other tid bits: 
- Portion size is legit. Burritos and Chimichanga are HUGE!

- Great Bang for your buck drink sizes. I like their horchata. 

- My other favorites are Enchiladas and the burritos.  

- Always Great service! 

- Hours and location is convenient for me. 

- Hands down, Fausto's over Roberto's. 

- And I'll repeat again, The BEST Carne Asada Fries in Las Vegas. Try it! You'll thank me later. ;-) 



2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     21/100"}
{"text":"Great place! Consistent food that delivers every time, I use to go to the Roberto's on blue diamond but they have not been good lately on their food. I can always rely on Fausto's Nevada burritos."}
{"text":"Came here because chile verde had a ridiculous wait. I had carne asada fries which was super bland. The carrots and even the salsa had no flavor! Everything is pre-made and they just heat it up. My fries were ready literally a minute after I ordered. My friend had tacos and the tortillas were cold and stale. Totally did not satisfy our Mexican craving. Do yourself a favor and just go to don tortaco or robertos....even better go to chile verde! The cucumbers were good! The staff was very nice also!"}
{"text":"Faustos is a place just like robertos or don tortaco the only thing they do different is the beans and the types of chips they use. They have better refried beans than the other two and they offer a little more on the menu. Now i don't recommend breakfast burritos here which are one of my faves but I do recommend the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, carne asada nachos"}
{"text":"We came here on a fluke when we were getting our car serviced. We had the Veviche tostadas which amazed us. They were 3.50 on special and they had a layer of avocado on top. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Nevada burrito . Much better than robertos, food isn't near as greasy as other places , plus this restaurant isn't a chain, it was brought up from nothing by don Fausto. 
Come here all the time and never disappoints"}
{"text":"Awesome burritos... Made to order, great price.  Three salsas to choose from and all very good!  Bomb tortilla too!!"}
{"text":"I guess I just ordered the wrong thing? Craving a quesadilla we headed to Fausto's for lunch. What I got was inedible, disgusting and a mess. Granted we did take out.. granted we do live 3 minutes away. I don't know what excuses I can make. I opened my little styrofoam container and it was just a jumbled mess of grease and slime. The chicken was really low quality, the orange grease was everywhere and the tortillas sucked. The veggies were gross too while we're at it. It was inedible and I threw it away. I travel to mexico all the time (probably been 25 times?), I grew up in TX. I know good mexican food and I know good \"americanized\" mexican food as well. This wasn't good at all. You can in fact make a quesadilla that isn't greasy. Authentic mexican places do NOT use orange cheese. Doesn't happen. I attached a photo of the nasty monstrosity of a quesadilla they served me. 

I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2 stars because the hubby's nachos were decent. The carnitas on his nachos were bland and the meat quality wasn't great, but at least the portion was good?"}
{"text":"Really sad i used to love this location but the  new management or owners changed the salsa and removed stuff from the menu.  I been eating at this location since it opened.  I guess im going to robertos from now on.  :("}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, but the world must be warned of bad Mexican food. We can all raise our standards. 
This place is around the corner, so I gave them way more attempts to satisfy me than I typically would. I have always found the people to be very nice, and service is very fast (the only reason for 2 stars). 
The problem is the food. First, it's all very bland. Next, the quality of ingredients is quite low - meat is fatty, tortillas have a stale taste, beans have little flavor. Even the nachos tend to be a pile of greasy chips with some sort of mess scattered about and some un-melted cheese on top... ok, I will acknowledge I basically just described nachos, but these nachos were not good. How do you screw up nachos?
We finally had to take this one out of the rotation after not feeling good following back to back visits. There are too many mediocre Mexican restaurants - and chains - in the local area to begin with. This one ranks pretty low."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! The food is outstanding, clean and well prepared , the staff is really nice and polite, my favorite plate the French fries, delicious! The tacos are well cook and flavored, the place is well located, I will recommend this place, definitely I come back."}
{"text":"I wish there were half as many Fausto's around town as there are Roberto's. 

Walking into Fausto's you will see an almost identical menu to Roberto's, but IMO Fausto's has them beat hands down on taste.

I love their carne asada and their carne asada taco platter is the best I've had. Hearty portions of high quality food. Excellent Spanish rice too.

The California burrito with the carne asada and french fries inside is pretty awesome too.

The service at this location has always been fast and friendly. The guys in the back are usually singing along with the Mexican music and look like they are enjoying their work. When you open the meal box it looks like they actually care about making it look good and don't just throw it all together as quickly as possible like some other places.

IMO they have the best fast Mexican food in town. Just wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Was going to go to Robertos tonight but had to stop at cvs. So saw This place. Sooo happy I decided to try it ! I will not return to Robertos.   This is my go to for quick Mexican fix!   Delish had a veggie burrito so good! Guacamole was amazing ! It's a definite must if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Truth be told...never have I ever had exceptional customer service from a Mexican joint until I dined in at Fausto's. The cashier was friendly and gave me a few suggestions on some of their popular items since I can be indecisive. I ended up ordering the Carne Asada enchilada with rice and beans and OMG..the meat was made in the best way I've ever had it. I wish they had the Orange Bang drink but that's alright, the customer service was AWESOME! :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get a burrito and rice. Front is always friendly and price is good."}
{"text":"after spending a few days at the grand canyon and living off Dennys I was dying for something ethnic to eat. So on my way to vegas i bust out the yelp app on my phone and start looking for places close to where I am. I just randomly picked Faustos from the list. Mexican food sounded good and I was dying to eat something decent. 

I was pretty happy with the food here. sure a lot of it had to do with not eating anything worth wild for the past 3 days. I thought the quality was pretty good. Decent mexican food in a casual enviroment. 

I am happy I stopped here to eat. If I'm ever in the area again i would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I had their CA burrito combo for lunch on a Thursday 

- A CA burrito without fries? Big time FAIL. Disappointing. 
- Red sauce was good.
- I think this is 'nuff said. Take it off the menu if you can't make it right. lol. 
- Don't come here for Americanized Mexican food. Great for people that never had SD Mexican food.
- Their hard shredded beef tacos were tasty."}
{"text":"Love Fausto's, customer service and food is great. Fausto's is way better than similar places like Roberto's. I especially like the carne asada burrito and torta."}
{"text":"So we just got back from a week long vacation from the East Coast and we're jonesing for some Mexican food but we're too lazy to go to a real restaurant so I mention Fausto's, we hadn't been here in forever. After perusing Yelp photos I settle on the Chicken Chimichanga and we were gonna share a Carne Asada Nacho. Doug just got a Carne Asada burrito.
Holy hell the nacho size was enormous, we hardly put a dent in them, but they were good. The star was the Chicken Chimi, so good! Believe the reviews. The chicken was moist, kind of wet with a tomatoey juice, with lots of cheese, peppers, tomatoes and onions inside of a perfectly fried tortilla that was not greasy. I will totally get it again and urged my husband to as well.
The food is super cheap for the amount you get. Service is fast and friendly. 
Why have we been apart so long? I won't let that happen again."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I got charged MORE to have LESS on my quesadilla...how the hell does that make sense? (Asked for chicken quesadilla with no veggies, had to pay $.50 more for the no veggies part. No, it's not a lot, but still, WTF?)"}
{"text":"Clean. Cheap. Legit. Just like Roberto's but better. The salsa bar is fresh and clean. All the regular stuff. 3 salsas actually. Will be back every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love-love-love this place!  Moving here from Cali, I miss some really good Mexican food.  This is totally the place to go!  Aleks and Fanny are wonderful with superb, fast and friendly customer service.  Thanks so much for your yummy food and professionalism.  We look forward to going here again!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! It reminds me of Roberto's same layout and everything just a different name ! The only thing I noticed is that it is a little pricey but the care asada is good quality. So it's not bad if you're in the mood for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Breakfast burro was made to order and service was friendly and prompt. I can appreciate Faustos for being consistent with their food, when looking for the quick fix, try this spot out. Nice little hidden gem tucked away in shopping center. Opens at 5 so cool for the early risers too, or the nite owls.. I've been through the other locations and it's a lil different vibe () but same consistent food. I prefer this spot over Roberto's ( hold the grease tacos) any day. Clean, friendly, and the salsa bar is kept clean which I can appreciate also. Faustos is definitely Not like some places ive been and was immediately turned off by the carrots growing roots! \"Leme get a carne Asada burrito, hold the flies\"! Lol 
Check it out, the Tamarindo is recommended too, I'm personally not a fan of horchata but I'm sure theirs is on point.."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the \"grill\" at the end of their name; Fausto's offers authentic mexican food much like you could find in your mama's kitchen (well, not my mama's, but someone's...) It's simple and tasty here. Good, cheap mexican food: My favorite! It doesn't try to be fancy, nor is it fresh-mex like Chipotle or Baja Fresh. This restaurant is extremely similar to Roberto's (right down to the salsa bar with fresh veggies), yet I think their flavor is just a tad better! If you're in the mood for homemade Mexican food, this is the closest you'll come (unless your mama cooks tamales better than mine...)"}
{"text":"The food is good but don't come when they open.

On two occasions I came to pick up breakfast burritos for the office.  They open at 6:00 A.M. But when I arrived at 6:20 to pickup food, the cook/counter person told he didn't have any food ready and motioned to the grill (I inferred the grill was heating up).  

The sign should read the staff arrives at 6:00 A.M. And food will be ready when it's ready."}
{"text":"This has been the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas and is extremely inexpensive. I ordered the chimichanga and it came with nearly a pound of chicken.

It's not the classiest place by any means, but the food was so good I went back the next day to try their chorizo breakfast burrito. Another 10/10. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Great food, love the nachos and California burrito with red sauce. Always quick and friendly service as well, great lunch apot."}
{"text":"Aimlessly driving down Eastern looking for a place to find something for dinner that would please the entire fam is not always easy. We roll right by sin city sushi and then passed cafe Rio and just keep on truckin... At this point we all started getting to the point of being \"Hangry\" (so hungry you are angry)... so i made the executive decision to start searching parking lots for places that we have never been. After all, we must find new places to yelp about. 

After the third parking lot the pink fluorescent lighting of Faustos caught our attention.. Yes a little Roberto'esque but we figured, \"Why not?\" 
Unlike many of the other places I have reviewed lately this little joint was packed.... You have the Indian family to my left getting down on a huge plate of chicken nachos and the group of mid twenty couples sitting in the corner eating this stuff family style like they are at a Mexican buca di beppo. I have never walked into a small place like this and have to stake claim on the last table left to sit in. 

After we put our order in I noticed they have a cafeteria type serving cart in the middle of the room that has the salsas and pickled jalapenos and all the fix-ins.... Only problem was that the place was so busy I could barely get to it. About 10 minutes later our grub had arrived, i had ordered my own plate of carne asada nachos and was amazed at the size of this thing.. the meat was great and perfectly seasoned the salsa was fresh and well worth the 2 arm wrestling and thumb war matches I had to survive to get to the salsa cart. 

This was a pleasant surprise when you look at how we ended up here. The reason why i took one star away was the tacky interior design.. Obviously i am not expecting some Mexican ultra-lounge but the pink walls with crooked pictures could be updated just a little.

I would recommend the food if you are looking for something quick to eat. Be prepared to leave full and with a box because the portions are huge.. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I had the Carnitas burrito. It was hands-down the worst Carnitas burrito I've ever had in my life.
Maybe everything else tastes pretty good but that was disgusting."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and I always look for new places. Although I prefer the more formal restaurants, some of the faster-service places are pretty good.  Someone recommended Fausto's to me so I gave it a try.  Let me tell you, you get a lot of food for your money!  There's enough for two people in those entrees. And there are many entrees to choose from.  Service can be a tad slow, and the place was hot inside the day I was there.  

The restaurant is kind of small but it's big enough for a large group to get together when several tables are pulled together (as was happening the day I was there). There's not a lot of room by the counter to wait for your order if you are doing takeout, though. Overall, the food is tasty enough- it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Nice authentic Mexican restaurant. A Vegas or Henderson gem. I was in the area on business and had lunch there Nice super Burrito special. Simply place nothing fancy. Nice food good staff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because it next to an appointment I had with my doctor and I was hungry.  

While I don't particularly think there was anything massively wrong with this place, I did think it was better than going to Roberto's taco shop.  I wasn't thrilled with the taste of the carne asada, it tasted kind of bland and tough and not really good quality, although I give props for overstuffing their burritos with it.  Had the meat been better I would have loved the carne asada burrito.  

I also tasted an al pastor taco and liked it better, but it was a little overrun with guacamole.  My favorite though was the beef tamales, the red sauce was wonderful and flavorful.

I will come here again because I was a huge fan of those tamales."}
{"text":"This is a very casual, no frills kind of restaurant with really great Mexican food at very low prices. I had chicken sopes and they were so good and the portions are huge! I brought mine home. My friend had Chili Relleno and said it was one of the best she's had. I was looking for a place like this, so I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious burritos in the Henderson area! One of my nursing professors suggested Faustos, since it was very good with portions and close to our nursing school. They have one of the best carne asadas I've had in a while. I have to compare them to the Mexican place back home called Adalberto's (Socal locations call it Albert's; it's the same kind of franchise). They are both really good, but since I can't have Adalberto's until I go home, I will have Fausto's!

If you're looking for a fast food Mexican place with decent prices, you have to go to Fausto's! Try their chimichanga and California burrito! Maybe the tostadas? A lot of people get this during lunch time."}
{"text":"After moved to Vegas, I haven't really find a burrito joint around where I live. My friend recommended me this place, so I decided to give it a try yesterday, and I was not disappointed at all.
I ordered the Tuesday special Chicken burrito, and my gf had the Nevada burrito
they both taste great, I think we both love the Nevada burrito more, steak and fries in a burrito, what a great combo!
My chicken burrito was great for it was only $3
I love how they have daily specials for weekdays, it's just awesome when you are trying to save some bucks and still get the great taste and portion

the only downside why I didn't give it a 5-star is due to the kitchen size, the food may take awhile when it gets busy. And I noticed that's why many people call ahead to place the order before they go pick it up

this place is definitely going to be our favorite taco/burrito joint now"}
{"text":"I loathe Panda Express - my family's favorite fast food joint. I wanted something else while they ate next door, so I got Fausto's to go last night (10/1/11) around 7 PM. 

I got the lengua (beef tongue) combination plate, no beans, with corn tortillas for $7.50. There's enough food for at least two adults and a kid. I've already gotten two meals out of it, and I still have leftovers. 

Was it the best lengua I've had? No. Not by a long shot. If you're in the mood for quick and cheap Mexican food and are not into Roberto's, I'd say this is a decent choice but isn't something I'd crave."}
{"text":"Fausto's almost got two stars. Almost. That second star went down the toilet that I had to rush to about 10 minutes after eating their food. TMI, sorry, that's what their food did to me.

I love Mexican food. Absolutely love it. Eat it as often as possible, it's delicious. After years of hearing about Fausto's and spending every Wednesday driving past it, we were at a loss of where to go last night, so to Fausto's we went.

I ordered a two enchilada plate, and a taco. $7.00 for this, how is that cheap?

When my food came out, I dove into the taco, it had a couple slivers of cheese and a head of iceburg worth of lettuce on there. After adjusting the lettuce to taco ratio, I enjoyed the flavor of the snack. $2.00 for a taco is kind of steep though, so it was not THAT good.

Next up, I was curious, did Fausto's actually make their enchiladas with melted cheese inside, or are they like everywhere else and pawn off shredded cheese wrapped in a tortilla, drenched in red sauce, with melted cheese on top, as enchiladas?

As I expected, but hoped to be wrong, their \"enchilada\" was filled with cheese that looked like it was almost on the verge of melting, a drastic improvement over other establishments, but still very disappointing.

The \"enchilada\" flavor was OK, the shredded cheese inside just distracts from the enchilada experience.

Also, when telling someone their total is $XX.50, then charge them $XX.75 for using a card, without any notice or a sign stating your policy, you insure I won't eat there again, even if the food was amazing. I hate being lied to, and I hate being charged more than you just told me I was being charged.

When looking for a table to sit at, we were relegated to the table beneath the blaring tv. Why? Because every single other table in there was filthy. They had a kitchen full of staff, not that many people ordering food, yet the dining room was a sty."}
{"text":"I was a regular at another Fausto's location and was excited to see this location near our house. My hubby had never been and it was a hard sell to convince him that this place is better than Roberto's....but the food speaks for itself and he was quickly on board.

This is our taco shop of choice - the only thing that would make it better would be if they had a drive thru. Everything is delicious - our favorites are the Nevada burrito (what a California burrito is in California) and the Henderson burrito (chicken). Their beans are tasty, which is always important.

The service is friendly and fast and we can always depend on Fausto's for a quick and cheap meal! They also offer a Taco Tuesday special on chicken tacos - $1 each, which is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Fausto's many time and I am sad to say the quality has been consistently going down hill. And to top of the decline in quality they have decided to increase their prices. Spend some of that money and get new credit card machine. Made me late for an appointment ran my card for 10 mins still couldn't get it to work. Luckily I had cash.  But come on food sitting there getting cold as they tapped machine opened it closed it pushed on it, and banged it on the counter, like it was an old tv that you have to hit with a shoe. Get it together. And the amount of filling In the Burritos has gotten lower as well."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Faustos you've never done me wrong when I need a quick fix for something cheap and delicious. Your servings are generous, your pork is always tender, and I always no exactly what I am getting when I get there. Just stop closing at 11, I like to eat late at night!"}
{"text":"It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.

I had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican food spot, but the menu seems to have changed over the years (I swear, they used to have flautas!), and the language barrier can be rather annoying. You can enunciate and repeat your order numerous times, only to have them ruin it anyway. I still prefer over Roberto's."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to post an updated review for this Fausto's. The original was five stars, but this location has gone downhill the past year or so. 

The first thing is that they used to have three delicious salsas that I used for every meal. They were great. However, those are no more. 

Now there are only two salsas that are both pretty bad. Tonight they were so runny I couldn't even get any to stay on my chips. Sad!

To make this issue more pressing, the entrees seem to have lost all flavor and I have no delectable salsa to mask that fact. I had enchiladas and a taco and both were incredibly bland. 

This used to be a place I'd bring friends from out of town to try and now I think I may have just made my last visit. 

I just hope management reads this and fixes things because I saw other reviewers stating the same thing."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times now the fist time was great. The second time everything was just cooked to death the taco shells were super hard you couldn't even bite them the carne asada was cooked a little tuff"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years, I was in the area and decided to stop for a breakfast burrito. 

I'd have to say very disappointing. The burrito lacked in flavor but the worst part was the burned bacon they filled my burrito with. 

I can really appreciate that they weren't stingy with the bacon but it also leads me to believe they weren't stingy with it because it's so burned? No clue.

Not impressed, I won't be back, at least not for a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Im going to have to agree with Chuck here.  Faustos is as authentic as you can get.  Usually get the taco salad or chimichangas!  Everything is fresh and made fresh.  The prices are cheap for the amount of food you get.  I've gotten all my friends to try this place, and no one has had a bad experience yet.  Highly recommend this place to anyone craving some really good mexican."}
{"text":"Referred here by a friend and they were right, even my picky son said the food was good. We had the breakfast burritos they were excellent."}
{"text":"After a recommendation, three of us headed to Fausto's for dinner.  After scanning the wall menu, we ordered three separate combo plates.. They arrived barely Luke warm.  The cheese enchiladas were pretty cheese less, very little filling.  We didn't care for the refried beans on the tostada or the combo plate.  We found them to be very \"lardy\" tasting.  Nothing special about the chili relleno, either.  I doubt if we will be back anytime soon.  There are just too many Mexican food restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite coworker ordered carne asada fries and the taste was rather overpowering on the salty side than the last time I had it. Perhaps it's just that day that whoever seasoned the fries or the carne, was over-seasoned. Lol I ate just enough to accompany the salad I had but couldn't finish it. I honestly have to say it IS the best carne asada fries over Robertos. I had to drink lots of water today to balance out the sodium. Lol good eats!"}
{"text":"I have two words for you...breakfast burrito! Oh my God. It is so good. This place reminds me of being back home in Phoenix. The food is fresh, spicy, and gigantic. It's a hole in the wall but, thats kind of what I love about it! Taco, burrito, nachos....oh God. I'm going right now. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Their burritos and tacos are fresh and well made - very good.  Their salsa station had red and green salsa (I thought mixing the two together was perfect!), limes, cucumbers and some pickled veggies.  Depending on what side of town you're in Fausto's is a good choice to stop in for some quick, authentic Mexican grub."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss for me here.  I've had their carnitas burrito and unfortunately the pork had dried pieces, overly greasy and plain not so good.  I've also had their chicken machaca, loaded with chicken and scrambled eggs.  This is a pretty good dish to settle with if they don't have good cuts of meat for the day. 

The large tortillas that are used to wrap the burritos are extra big and makes wrapping all the goodies snug in it's place.  I usually unwrap my burrito, add a few extra sauces, load it with their marinated carrots before I can enjoy my meal.  

Their menu is nearly identical to Roberto's and I personally prefer to go across the street for Roberto's instead."}
{"text":"Came here on a fluke and boy was it one on the best one's yet.

Hands down the best menudo in town. No hominy (the way i prefer it). It is soooo well seasoned and not at all overly greasy. It doesn't stink or taste dirty, if you eat menudo you know what I mean. It's $5 for a large portion of this stuff. A great deal if you ask me. 

Fish tacos - okay. not to die for. not the best.

Carne asado - decent. good. 



But i come here for the Menudo. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"Had a carne asada burrito and it was OK, but it had a couple \"crunchy\" parts, which I didn't think should be in there.  Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Went to this joint as my friend and I decided to try it out due to our Mexican food phase after a recent trip to san Diego. 

First things first, as compared to other taco shops (robertos, amigos), this place is CLEAN. It's well maintained, and bright on the inside, so it gives your digestive system some peace of mind. 

Prices are a tad bit cheaper than that of other taco shops, so I went a little crazy and ordered an excessive quantity of food. I had the lengua, carne asada, and fish tacos, along with a sausage breakfast burrito. The standout quality within these were the quality of ingredients, fresh veggies and good, high grade quality lean meat. I especially liked the fish taco as it came served with tartar sauce and a tangy pico de gallo salsa. Breakfast burrito was above average. 

Overall, faustos will be my taco fixation for the moment, it's a small place located in a strip mall with highly rated yelp restarunts such as Oyshi sushi but don't be afraid to check this place out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend went here instead of roberto's because it was cheaper. We found out the beans were made of lard, which was a huge disappointment because I'm a vegetarian. He got the carne asada fries anyway with sour cream, pico, and something else. Honestly, it want that bad because of the pico, but it wasn't what I was craving. He ordered a side of gauc on the side since he's allergic, and when I opened it, I was horrified. It was like green slime. It looked like they had gotten a package of green powder and mixed it with water. Legit slime. I was so disgusted I gagged just thinking about it for another hour. Overall, we were extremely disappointed and will not be returning again. The churros are good though."}
{"text":"At first it seemed like a Roberto's, as far as the menu set up an environment. The food is definitely better, The rolled tacos, tacos and super burrito, we're all very good. very clean location and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not happy with the food today ..chicken looked and smelled different ..i said something to the guy who took my order , he didn't seem to care"}
{"text":"Authentic is the one word I would use to describe Faustos. With it being so close to my school, I stop by from time to time. I absolutely love the food here. True Mexican food and it comes at such an amazing price. I, most often, purchase a breakfast burrito that is only $3.95. I love this place and the food is extremely tasty. I would highly recommend Faustos if you want real Mexican food for such a spectacular price."}
{"text":"I am a 10+ year customer of Fausto's, they know me when I walk through the door, tonight I asked the cashier who's been there for every bit of 10 years for a little extra green sauce for my steak taco and he looked at me and said NO. I said do you mean I cannot have any extra sauce and he said NO. He didn't even say you could pay for it, he just said NO.
This brings up another issue I keep noticing which is the burritos have consistently become smaller and smaller as they are skimping on the meat yet still charging the same price.
I am going to Roberto's across the street from now on!
Next time you should think about CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
