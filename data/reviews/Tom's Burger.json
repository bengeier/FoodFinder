{"text":"We ordered the 'home burger' as opposed to the regular burger.  It's pretty big and is super delicious.   Last few times I went in, it smelled like dirty mop water so now I just send my husband in to order and we do take-out.  Fries are just so-so, not much flavour."}
{"text":"What a shit hole.  Seriously.    I am baffled by the other writers who gave it anything more than a two.  But a four?  Come on, man..... if this is a four star place, McDonald's would be off the charts.  Good greek salad?  WTF?  More like limp lettuce with low quality feta and few slices of tomatoes.  Also, have you ever seen a place that fills your souvlaki dinner with so much rice before?  I mean, there's enough rice here to feed an entire tribe.  And I have never seen chicken skewers so pathetically skinny before.  Service is completely assidine (in fact, what complete dicks the two guys in there were).  Ambiance?  Okay, well it's supposed to be a dive diner..  so it does that very well.  Bad food, bad service.  Stay away from this place.  No wonder it was empty.  Should have trusted my instincts."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for lunch or dinner. The restaurant is nice and has an \"old school\" feel! Poutine is a must have. My girlfriend had the chicken souvlaki which she enjoyed as well. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Tom's burgers is a miracle to mankind. I frequent visits to this old-style diner for nothing less but the food. Sure the restaurant may be a bit dirty but remember, you go to a restaurant to eat, not to look at the walls.  Every time I go there I order the gyros on pita, and boy these guys stack it up. You get a stack of gyros on a pita, with an extra spoon of tzakziki upon request. And it's not the cheap no frills kind, no sir. This is the premium kind of gyros that you salivate upon thinking about.  The poutine is heaven. They take a plate, stack it up with a huge mound of fries, pile it up with cheese, and take one of those huge soup ladles and pour gravy all over it. Share with a friend unless you have a huge stomach :D.  The burgers are average, nice and juicy and toasted on the grill, but nothing I would end up thinking about again.  The chicken souvlaki dinner (which I got a while ago) is above average, juicy but a bit lacking in portions for chicken, making up for it in the heap of rice . Classy, averagely priced, and the best Greek food I've ever tasted. I'm coming back till I die :D."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some friends so I checked it out last time I was in Markham. It's a cozy no frills joint but the food is what makes the place. I had the homemade burger and the onion rings. Both were amazing (I don't even like onion rings normally). It actually tasted like food, not the processed shiz you get at ronalds. I recommend it for somewhere casual."}
{"text":"Went shopping at Markville Mall with my wife and daughters ( big mistake) and was so tired and hungry, that needed to fill up my empty stomach.  Was in the mood for a big juicy burger,  and fries, so drove straight to Toms Burger on Hwy 7.  I ordered the home made burger with fries, my wife the pork souvlaki on a bun, and the girls only wanted fries and onion rings,  The food portions were generous,  cooked perfect, and delicious, and the price very reasonable. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Toms Burger is probably Markhams best kept secret. Right on Highway 7, you've probably passed by heading to Main St Markham. It's a small little restaurant that has their own parking spot.  Their greek food is absolutely amazing. You will forget about the food court greek food after you've been here. Their souvlaki with potatoes and rice are absolutely amazing - their potatoes are marinated in some tomato base and really adds to the flavour. It's also a huge portion - two people can easily finish one plate.   The burgers are freshly made. I will agree with the rest of the comments, it is made well-done so there is some charring in the meat. That being said, their burgers are a thousand times better than the chain.   The two men who work there can be grumpy sometimes - I will admit. Just a little rough around the edges but genuine people. It's just the two of them - they make great food and yes, they work long hours.   Toms Burger is my go to place for burgers and greek food in Markham."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries and souvlaki served reasonably quickly by two surly old men. But it is great food.   I generally get the Souvlaki here and the wife gets the \"homemade burger\"  which is better than the standard this patty and potentially made at home vs by a machine.   The toppings bar is fresh,  and by request and includes fried onions and BBQ sauce by request."}
{"text":"I grew up in Markham back when it was called Tommy's, i think one of the owners got out but nevertheless, a Markham tradition.  The Macedonian owner's are nice and unlike alot of Macedonian and Greek burger joints around Toronto, they actually renovated about 10 years ago.  It's always clean too.  The burger's are great but i like the steak on a bun even better (way better than Lick's steak and alot cheaper) ..... They used to have really thick (and fattening) onion rings, don't think they have them like that anymore.... all in all a good burger joint.....also alot of people tell me they have a good breakfast."}
{"text":"I was craving for burger and decided finally to try this joint after hearing and reading good reviews about this.  Man, what a big disappointment this was! My burger was so burnt (see pic) and some of the fries were over fried and they weren't crispy at all. The burger was dry and wasn't juicy ! Wth!! So mad.i should have went to hero burger instead or South st burger! I'll be honest though I tried their svolaki before and it was decent - so I'm not sure if this burger was a one off or that's just how they are.   Service - I'm sure the regulars know about the grumpy man there so I don't need to say more about that .   This dinner experience totally dampen my mood and now I'm just as grumpy as that man."}
{"text":"I went on a weeknight about 30 minutes before closing and it was completely empty inside. It seemed like they also already did their cleanup as the floors were a bit wet still and half the restaurant's lights was off. The guy at the counter who took our order seemed kind of impatient maybe because he wanted to get off work but the other work who was there was way friendlier (maybe he was Tom). I ordered the cheeseburger with fries and a soft drink. The burger was actually pretty good and juicy, definitely had the taste of a diner burger. The fries were freshly deep-fried. it was about $20 for a 2 burgers, 1 fries, and 1 soft drink. Definitely not the cheapest for a diner. I'm glad the nicer worker was the one who was helping us out because if it was the grumpy guy the whole time, I definitely would not come back again. But maybe next time I will go back to try the souvlaki dinner or something new."}
{"text":"This is an old-school heart-attack burger joint. If you want a reliable hamburger for a decent price, you can't really go wrong here.  The atmosphere is what you'd expect from the outside of the building. It's pretty worn inside, but everything is clean.  I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here, but if you're in the area and want a quick burger, I'd stop in."}
{"text":"Passed this place on a whim a few years  ago and decided to pop in for a bite. I ordered the Greek dinner - holy I was not disappointed. Huge portion, delicious chicken souvlaki and salad.   The restaurant is very small and gives off the \"hole in the wall\" vibe but food is great. I wish I lived closer so I could go back."}
{"text":"This is a great local dive.  My favourite thing here is their chicken souvlaki dinner.  The potatoes here are amazing, very dense with a nice oily tomato flavour.  The souvlaki isn't the greatest I've ever had but it's certainly serviceable.  And as for the salad, I personally love crappy Iceberg lettuce, its the best lettuce for dressing, and their dressing is delish.  The burger is a super greeky style burger that I'm accustomed to, meaning lots of oregano and crumbly.  I'd give it a solid 3 stars for the burger, tons of flavour but the texture just isn't for me.  If you're in the area definitely check it out, it's one of the few dive burger joints markham has and much better than the abundance of chain stores."}
{"text":"Where do I begin....we ordered a cheeseburger, a banquet burger (bacon cheeseburger), onion rings and poutine.  For the burgers, the patties were way too thin and the bun was way too thick.  We couldn't even tell what the burger patty tasted like without just biting into the patty and not the burger as a whole.  Onion rings were meh!  Poutine was with shredded cheese and not cheese curds, frozen fries as well.  My biggest concern with this place is health & food safety.  There were two people working, both were coughing, sometimes into their arm (the RIGHT way) and sometimes into their hands (the WRONG way).  The one that worked as cashier also dressed the burgers.  We were in the restaurant for about 30 minutes and I don't think I saw them wash their hands once.   Their souvlaki dinners look pretty good.  If it wasn't for their health & food safety issues, I would go back to try it..."}
{"text":"It is not the best burger in Markham. I did not enjoy the fries very much. They were tough on the outside and mulch/dry in the inside.   Many regular customers would order poutine as opposed to fries - it probably has to do with the fries.   I had the regular home burger and I thought the burger was seemingly tasty but was overdressed with condiments. The condiments that was used were the usual barbeque, mayonnaise,  and mustard. By the time I got to my burger, it was soggy and the buns started to fall off the beef patty."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about Tom's burgers in Markham as one of the best in Markham I would have to agree.   It's your typical Greek owned burger joint,   I had the double home burger and it was so massive and juicy. The onion rings were lightly battered, not over greasy.  Only thing is cash only policy but they do have an atm.   Glad I added this spot to my list I'm rarely up in Markham."}
{"text":"Yikes, grumpy owners & lousy food. Stay away, this place should have closed years ago."}
{"text":"I have been in Markham my entire life and it's mind boggling how long it has taken me to try Tom's burgers. It has been here for as long as I can remember and there's a reason why. These are some of the best burgers around in Markham!   I had their single home burger with a side of onion rings and pop - a combo that came up to around $13. This is a pretty good deal considering how much fast food chains are charging for their combos nowadays. The kicker is that these burgers are massive, and the double is almost excessive.  The main thing about their burger is just how fresh it was. This thing will fall apart on you (especially the double), and it's just so soft. The amount of toppings they out on your burger is amazing. I love just how excessive it is and how I need to feed myself the toppings once they fall down; it's all part of the enjoyment!  Their onion rings were fried to order; they weren't made in house but they were still excellent and not the heavily battered variety. They were crispy and yummy.  I wish one of the guys working there was a bit more pleasant. The man taking the orders just didn't seem like he wanted to be there and it was very coarse."}
{"text":"Ol' school burger and fries joint with some ol' school Greek guys behind the grill. Would love to go back and try some ol' school souvlaki. - Updated: Reduced from a 5-star to a 4-star since they only accept cash (However there is an ATM machine inside).  In today's somewhat advanced society, there should be more options in terms of payment available for customers other than cash.  That is my honest opinion."}
{"text":"A classic diner style burger joint. My hubby craved a burger and wanted to try Tom's for a long time already. So we finally got the chance today to stop by.   Quite a few items on their menu list. To name a few: Chicken Burger, Fish Burger, Poutine, Souvlaki, Grilled Cheese, & Basic Burgers, etc.  I saw they had a combo special at the side. So I decided to get the 4oz Beef Burger with Fries and a Drink for $7.60. I wanted onion rings, so I subbed that.   The burger was quite huge in size. And the onion rings were super crispy because they were freshly made on the spot. Burger was quite moist and ok tasty. But I didn't find it that spectacular. Next time I rather get the homemade burger instead, that one was a bit more tastier.   Again this place is a small and gasoline station like joint. I think the man told us, it's been around for 40 something years. So you kind of have an idea of what to expect. Cause it basically kept the retro decor. Signs were all yellow and worn out. The washroom creeped me out too...like I was entering a horror movie scene, and I was about to get killed lol!  The older gentleman that worked there told us next time we have to try the souvlaki. So maybe we will do so next time :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about 'old school' burger joints. I keep trying them and I'm continually disappointed. The problem is that I get sick of run of the mill fast food burger joints.   With that said, Tom's is a solid 3 stars and that's based mostly on effort.   Wait times are decent. The burgers are cooked made to order so they do take some time to actually cook.   My suggestion here is definitely the home made burger. I opted for cheese and bacon. That's partially because I can't help myself :)  Onion rings were ordered as an accompaniment.   The burger was good. Slightly over cooked, evidenced by the charring - which undermines the whole home made aspect - but was still tasty.   I've got a bone to pick with their choice of bread. While tasty, but probably better paired with a veal sandwich, it crumbles and just isn't the right bun. Sorry!  The onion rings portion was good. Thick onions, breaded and fried to golden perfection. The problem is the texture - they're not crispy enough. They're dense, hard to bite into and just not fantastic. Ease up on the batter to create a light crispiness that one can appreciate."}
{"text":"I personally think this is the best burger place in Markham. You have to make sure you order the \"Home\" burger or you will not like the burger, the non-home burgers are frozen out of a box burgers. Now the home burgers at Tom's (or as locals call it,Tommy's) are fantastic.   The also make great steak on a bun, souvlaki and greek salads. Also the Canadian classic peameal on a bun.   Lots of fresh toppings and classic small burger joint, \"unfriendly\" service. Not as bad as the soup nazi, but they have a certain style about themselves that can be somewhat harsh at times.   This place has been here forever, in fact, 25 years ago or so (dating myself here) I used to go there and get some food and play in the arcade in the basement. They used to have homemade onion rings, battered right in front of you, serious heart cloggers those were. Their current onion rings are pretty good though not home made anymore.   The orginal Tom sold the place many years ago and I think he runs a resturant up at woodbine and stouffvile side road, also a good place.   If your in the area, go get a home burger from Tommy's, its a pretty good burger."}
{"text":"Food 3.5 stars Overall 3 stars  We dropped by for lunch on a Saturday.  We both ordered a Homemade burger combo ($8.25).  The first impression was the fries looked really good.  Indeed they were crunchy on the outside and soft and warm inside.  They had a nice looking color.  The second impression was the patty was thick and big.  It was soft and moist, too.  It covered the complete face of the bun.  The \"beef\" patty had a hint of lamb flavour.  Mind you that I did hope they did had mixed lamb meat in or else the beef was going bad.    The venue looked old and worn.  The bathroom was clean enough and supplied with amenities such as hand soap and paper towel.  Tom's Burger must be popular.  Even though it was not a weekday, there were customers coming in non stop during our meal.  They ranged from families to construction workers.  They mostly ordered the Homemade Burger with Cheese."}
{"text":"Another good oldschool burger option. Place looks like it been here forever and the constant flow of customers points to why. Good and filling food, friendly staff and unlike some oldschool burger joints (I'm looking at you Johnny's) there is good seating so you can relax and enjoy the meal onsite :)"}
{"text":"Another Greek food joint.....mmmmm me like Greek food. They have their meat slovaki meals here but all I've ever tried is their burgers and poutine. Burgers are huge and filling and eating their burgers can get messy at times. All the juices and toppings keep on falling out when I eat it. The poutine was a bit disappointing as I found the fries tasted much like the cheap frozen kinds you get at the grocery. They definitely don't hold back on the cheese though. Big portions all the time. Come hungry and leave full. The place looks a bit dated but I usually get my food to go here."}
{"text":"Love this place, old school diner. It feels like you went back in time when you walk in. The burgers are amazing, the Homemade burger is what you have to get, and the poutine is great! Big and not pricy! They have Greek food as well, never had it but I'm sure it'll be as good as the burgers and fries."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I probably had one of the biggest burgers I've ever had in terms of height. I'm normally not a huge burger person, but I pass by Tom's Burgers almost 10 times a week and have never stepped in. I always see cars parked outside, so I figure there has to be some sort of attraction here.  It's certainly not the most eye candy restaurant, but eye candy should honestly be the last thing most people should care out. Hell, their TV inside is decades old and has funky colours, but you go to restaurants for their food, and that's what should count overall.  I ordered the double home burger and a bottle of Sprite. Honestly I could've done with a single home burger, but I didn't know how big the burgers were at that time (as I said, my experience with burgers is generally lacking). Needless to say I was unable to finish the burger, but nevertheless the patty was so delicious and juicy! It felt like there was some sort of melted havarti or blue cheese inside, which wouldn't surprise me as this place is somewhat of a Greek restaurant as well (they have souvlakis and gyros). However it is not something you should have everyday (minus .5 stars), as you can really feel the saturated and transfats while eating the burger. Still, once every so often and it's excellent!  Finally I took one star away due to the lack of a recycling procedure. Despite the fact the restaurant offers bottled pop, there's no recycling bin in here. Therefore you're either forced to take it out with you or put the bottle in the garbage can...something I vehemently hate.  Still, I highly recommend this restaurant for the casual burger eater, or for a burger enthusiast!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Lick's needs to step aside and bow down to Tom's.   I feel like Tom's has been around forever. Great place to grab a burger and top it up however you wish. The burgers are delicious, I've never tried anything else here. I've never had any issues with the service, but the decor is pretty typical of your average greasy burger joint."}
{"text":"Came here about 5 years ago, just to try it.  I remember ordering the banquet burger, It was huge!!!   I went back to try their greek food a few years later, .. wife didn't give it a thumbs up, she was comparing it to the danforth of course.  I don't know why i havent been back since... but will be going back soon !!  Good seating space inside.  parking is available in front, sides and back of building."}
{"text":"This place looks likes it been standing there for decades! Walked in hoping for a awesome burger! Was very disappointed..  Ordered Double House Burger and Bacon Cheese House Burger.  The regular burger is a 4oz frozen patty pre-brought... House Burger is the 6oz home-made fresh burger...  Straight-up the reason it's 2 stars is my 12 ounce burger tasted like there was more fillers then beef.."}
{"text":"Good burger joint. Service is very fast but the food is exactly what you would expect. They have a larger than normal variety of food but from the looks of it, they all taste pretty common. Price is pretty reasonable and the seating is friendly."}
{"text":"Tom's burger is like a mom & pop restaurant but when my boyfriend and I came in it was 2 European guys (chefs) who were about to close up.  Most of the lights were off in the restaurant, the floors mopped, and the chairs up - we were a little hesitant about ordering with 10 minutes to close but they assured us they were more than happy to accommodate.  My boyfriend ordered the banquet burger and omg he was so impressed. The burger was delicious and ginomorus and all these good things. The fries and gravy were phenomenal and demolished before we even got halfway home with our takeout. I got the chicken souvlaki and I was a little suspicious of having pitas as they always turned out to be a mouthful of bread and slivers of chicken.  My pita was delicious.  I told the guy I had 0 idea of what I wanted and he was like: ok, leave it to me. & I'm going back there asap and just letting him decide for me from now on.  The service here was beyond my expectations. It was a cold day in December (about 2 weeks ago) and so close to closing time but the chefs were so welcoming and friendly that it was like a breath of fresh air from other servers who are being fake nice to you for tips."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and I plan on coming back at least once more for the home made burger.  The first time I came here, I ordered the chicken slouvaki with rice, potatoes, and greek salad for take out. It was a huge serving which I appreciate when I pay so much for it. Otherwise, it was pretty standard for greek food.  The second time I came by, I had a steak on a bun and poutine. The steak on a bun was decent but nothing that blew me away either. The poutine i thoroughly enjoyed though. The gravy was not salty like some other places and the portions were quite big. My friend shared the poutine with me and had herself a homemade burger. It was a pretty big burger in comparison to my steak on a bun and was quite messy to eat. However, I feel like the messiest foods are the most delicious, so I do want to come back to try it.  Overall, a decent burger joint but nothing that is enough to bring me random Tom's cravings."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!   I am not really a burger eater. I do have burger urges once in awhile. I have been driving by Tom's Burger almost everyday. It is housed in a bungalow looking trailer/shed.   The Cheeseburger combo I ordered was A-OK! Personally I just eat grilled burgers so Tom's Burger is pretty good to my liking. The patty though previously frozen do taste juicy and hmmm that little burnt grilled marks. The bun was toasted on the grill too... it is a little crispy outside.  I like how I able to pick my toppings. The tomatoes are thickly sliced, the lettuce is fresh and crisp. No complaints at all there. And extra HOT peppers please! :)  The french fries are perfectly done too. The oil they use are fresh so the fries are all golden in colour, crispy and not soggy at all!  I would definitely come back for burgers when the cravings comes up again! And good thing is Tom's open Monday - Saturday  till 11 pm..."}
{"text":"The best place for a burger in Markham. Been coming here the past 15 years and the quality of the home burger has never changed. French fries are always fresh too! These guys do Greek food exceptionally good too! 5 stars all around.   If you're staying to eat at the restaurant it's a bit dated, but it adds to the greasy spoon experience. Don't be silly and expect the \"keg experience\" some past reviewers have come to expect."}
