{"text":"Been there a few times already since they opened a few months ago.

Really like it!  Good food.  The Suppli is yummy!  They have a nice selection of pizzas and pastas.  They also have brunch although they don't really advertise it (Bar Vespa, you should put a sign out about brunch in the mornings so more people will come in!)

Service is great.  One visit there was a mix up and I didn't get the tables I reserved.  The staff did there best to get us something similar and without a word brought us lots of free appetizers.  Very attentive wait staff.

Debit was not available yet.  Hope they offer it soon as that is a standard method of payment.

Everything is great here - food, ambience, decor, their story, service, price.  Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited Bar Vespa for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. They have amazing deals, great food and super friendly staff. The place itself is super clean and cozy. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place struggled - it was hit and miss, wasn't that popular and sometimes would give a downright crappy meal. The staff did try hard to rectify it though. It has definitely improved this year ! The pizzas and pastas are quite good and the atmosphere is so relaxed compared to every other overcrowded place in Liberty Village (and Liberty is horribly overcrowded). I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade pasta! Love Fridays with chef's inspiration! Really interesting tastes for reasonable prices. Staff is superfriendly and helpful! The best place in Liberty Village so far!"}
{"text":"I went with a large group on Saturday for a friend's birthday.  First off- ambience, service and food were all very good. I ordered the Suppli (Risotto balls) and a salad for my dinner, both were excellent.  Our server was fun, friendly and treated us all very well.. except for one detail: 

When I was trying to figure out which wine I'd like, our server helpfully recommended their \"special\" for the evening.  I said fine and requested a 9oz glass.  Fast-forward to the end of a great evening when we receive the bill. It turns out, that \"special\" was in fact $19 for a single glass of wine!  Are you kidding me?! 

Now, shame on me for not asking what the price per glass was - BUT shame on your staff for not informing me before I go ahead and order.  Special or not, that is completely outrageous and put a huge damper on our experience.  My husband ordered 3 (!!) pints Stella which totalled $22.   Do the math and you clearly can see which gives you better value for your hard-earned dollars. 

I'm sorry, but this to me is just bad customer service- it made me feel completely taken advantage of.   There are too many good italian restaurants around that aren't going to charge me an arm and a leg for a single glass of wine (or at least provide me with the information to make that decision for myself).  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food at Bar Vespa is good but it is service that makes this restaurant great. We visit it almost on weekly basis and are never disappointed. Weekly specials include glasses of wine so a visit is always affordable. Goat cheese pizza is great and pasta's are fresh and made ot order. It is not Terroni but it does not pretend to be."}
{"text":"A perfect triple \"meh.\" Service was somewhat below adequate, as if being the conduit between guests and the POS terminal was the primary duty. Food was semi decent, a bit on the oily side. The meatballs are quite tasty, but don't even try to ask for them to make a meatball panino, lest you be treated to a plethora of lame excuses (it's not on the menu, kitchen doesn't do that, etc.) And the atmosphere treads a fine line between comfortable and boring. Meh, meh, meh."}
{"text":"I'd  been to Vespa prior when it was more of a 'traditional' italian resto and I was less than impressed with overpriced uninspired food.  Now that it is more of a pizzeria we thought we would give it a shot.

Well, the food is certainly improved.  The arancini appetizer was nicely done, with a spicy arrabiata sauce.  The pizzas, although nowhere near the quality of a Pizzeria Libretto or Good Son, was decent and the best you will find in Liberty Village.  There was a constant stream of takeout pizza heading out the door while we were there.

Clearly, lots of people have experienced Vespa's biggest weakness and avoid it by ordering takeout.  The service is glacially slow!  

We waited at least 45 minutes between each course.  Although the staff was apologetic, it was unacceptable and ruined what could have been an enjoyable meal.

Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Bar Vespa many times but yesterday was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  The waiters and waitresses were so disorganized. We sat at the bar waiting for our table. When our table became available we settled at the bar and went to our table on the patio. It was odd that they made us take our drinks, menu, and appetizer to the table. The server never offered. We settled in at the patio and waited for our waiter/waitress but noone came. Finally 20 minutes later I flagged one down and explained to them we have been waiting a long time,  and that i wasnt sure who was helping us and if we could please have our waitress to our table to order. The waitress that i was speaking with was nice enough to take our order. Then we overheard a conversation between her and our waitress ( so the person we ordered with was not our waitress)  figuring out who is responsible for which tables. We again waited for our food ( which seemed to take forever) and while waiting we ordered another drink.  We kept waiting until we had to ask again the status of our drink and food. Our waitress was serving us outside on the patio but also responsible for tables inside the reataurant on the opposite end to where we were sitting. You would think they would be more efficient as to who would be responsible for which tables.  Our food and drinks finally arrived. I orderd the pappardele but the pasta was over cooked and clumped together and the lamb was over cooked and chewy. The bus boy deliverd the food and noone asked me if i wanted fresh cheese or anything else for my pasta. Even if they dont offer fresh parmesan, our waitress should have came over to find out if we were hapoy with our meal but nope. All interaction was initiated by the customer and though the staff members looked over noone seemed intersted to help us.  I understand they were busy last night especially with the mac and cheese fest but they should have been prepared and it appeared they had ample staff but just disorganized.   I gave up on my terrible meal and asked for the bill. When i got the bill they messed it up. Though i settled at the bar for my first beer and wine it appeared on the bill which they changed.  The waitress was  nice annd polite but the whole experience was terrible. I will not be going back again for awhile and noone should ever order the pappardele. Yuck."}
{"text":"The service & food at Bar Vespa is HORRIBLE!!!! We came here for a bacherolette party dinner; party of 11. Our food took over and hour and half to come and that was just appetizers. Patrons who came in after us were served their food before we even got our drinks. Which were a joke. The pitcher of sangria we ordered was 3/4 ice. It was only enough to serve 3 drinks. All of our mains had no taste, no seasoning. Even with the added salt and pepper it was still bland. The pasta was sticky & had the consistency of paste. The chicken breast came out raw in a puddle of sauce with mushy vegetables. Resembling soup. That was not the description of said daily special \"Chicken Pecatta\". It took more than 4 requests to the manager to get the food taken off of the bill. They brought out complimentary champagne which they said would be 2 bottles which ended up being 1 dirty glass each. I've never in my life been to a place this bad. Plus it wasn't busy. Empty tables everywhere!! There is never any excuse for service this bad from the kitchen, manager and wait staff. The best part of Bar Vespa was leaving and going to Hero Burger... High Disappointing"}
{"text":"Went to Bar Vespa before TFC game(specifically wanting Summerlicious).It was especially busy due to game &World Cup match.  I made reservations 2 hours before kickoff time! We were seated fairly quickly once we arrived as we had reservations. Our server informed us the kitchen was backed up &could not do Summerlicious menu in time for game so we ordered off the \"TFC game\" menu.  Thinking time was an issue we only ordered mains which came out 5 mins later? Faster than McDees! My pasta was ok my husbands was horrible. The server only returned once we had finished, plates cleared by busboy to state \"your mains are taking a long time I'll check with kitchen.\" She didn't even know we had gotten food &eaten it! She then took 20 minutes to return to process my credit card after bringing the bill.  Good thing our food only took 5 minutes so we were well ahead of schedule.  I DO NOT recommend  Bar Vespa and will never return!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for their Wednesday night $10 pasta with any drink special. The food was superb, I order the Linguine with sautéed shrimp, sausage, garlic, chili flakes, rapini and a glass of house red (6 oz). They offer drinks special for $1/ oz for house red and white everyday between 3pm to 6 pm which makes this deal even sweeter. They also offer $10 pizza special on monday nights with any drink specials as well.

Excellent customer service, the server offered us complimentary bread with spices and olive oil while we waited for the food to arrive. The bread was a bit stiff, bit the spices and olive oil definitely made up for it.

I would definitely recommend coming here for a bite and especially in their summer time for the patio. It is very spacious and less packed than the other restaurants in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"I loved the mussels and the kale/spinach salad I ordered. The reason the rating is average instead of higher is because on three separate occasions I had to get up out of my chair and get the server. I was the last of a party of 20 to arrive. When I sat down I expected the waitress to see if I wanted drinks/food. First time I got up to get her (she was chatting with two other waitresses) was to order drinks. The second time I got up was to usher her over since I was waiting over 15 mins to order my food (plus the 20 mins or so it took for her to come over to order my drink). The last time was after we asked for the bills and waited so long to get them. I understand when restos get busy during rush hours but this level of customer service was unacceptable when I am ordering around 10 pm and we are really the only guests at the restaurant. Because the food was amazing I gave this place a 3*."}
{"text":"I had heard amazing things about this place, and happened to be in the area, so I stopped in for lunch.
I had a pizza and grilled calamari.  The calamari tasted very fishy. I probably should have sent it back, but I didn't want to make a fuss.
Silly me, I ended up with an upset stomach a few hours later. :(
I won't be returning....."}
{"text":"Service was really great. Was here for a work dinner party. Appetizers were also DELICIOUS. Menu isn't super in depth, a couple of the girls who ordered got something they weren't really expecting from the description given on menu, but the food was awesome, the atmosphere was awesome, same with the service...the website sucks though, they should have someone redo it."}
{"text":"The 'diovolo' pizza, was my favourite as it was very spicy and flavourful.  Butternut squash ravioli was also good.  They serve this delicious herb-infused olive oil with bread to start. Service was friendly and attentive.  Environment was swanky but not stuck-up.  

I guess the problem is that for the prices charged, you're better off going to Terroni on Queen W for more 'authentic' Italian food.  I will only go here on Thursday nights after 9pm when pizzas are 1/2 price.  I'm a Liberty Village resident and want to support the local businesses, but would be willing to walk up to Queen W considering prices are the same."}
{"text":"Dined here on a busy Saturday night w/ reservations for 10 (thank goodness we made reservations - if you are a large group you'll need them!) - too cold to sit out on the patio so perhaps that's why the dining room was so busy.

Service was great!  Can't complain there.

Loved the brie appetizer - it was scrumptious. I need to learn how to make that, or go back to have more.

Pasta was good. I liked the texture of the noodles. I've had better pasta but that being said I would still come back here, but maybe if someone else suggested it or for one of their weeknight specials.

Nice decor / ambiance inside. Typical liberty village!"}
{"text":"I went to Bar Vespa again this Friday, September 30th with two friends.  Unfortunately, this time I was not nearly as impressed as my first visit.

The whole place just seemed a little disorganized and chaotic.   About 3 different dishes (a plate, a  glass and a bottle of beer) were dropped throughout the restaurant that evening, shattering and causing a bit of an ado. 

My two friends ordered wine and I ordered Coke, but it wasn't until midway through our meal that I realized they had received their drinks and I hadn't.  I also realized midway through dinner that we hadn't received any bread.  They did bring some at that point, but it would have been nice to have something to nibble on before we received our meals.  I also find it odd that they pour a plate of olive oil & spread for each person, rather than just leaving it on the table for us to pour ourselves?

One friend had a Margherita Pizza, which looked okay but not great.  The other friend and I both had spaghetti & meatballs and were disappointed - the pasta was quite al dente - too much so in fact.  It was also gummy and sticky - not the texture I look for in pasta.   My friend was finished and I was almost finished, before the hostess offered us parmesan cheese - our server hadn't done so.  

The Panna Cottta, which I had enjoyed for dessert two weeks ago, wasn't quite as good this time.

I think the restaurant has great potential, but it just didn't wow me this second time around.  It was quite busy all night though, so hopefully things become a bit more consistent before the reputation is on the line."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I decided to try a new place in our neighborhood. Bar Vespa.

Bar Vespa is in Liberty Village and has only been open for a few weeks. The grand opening hasn't even happened yet as they said they are still trying to get their game together.

They shouldn't worry. Eating there was a great experience.

From the time we walked in to the time we left, we were well looked after. The manager came over a couple of times to ensure everything was fine. The bartender came over with drinks and to chat. The hostess checked up on us too and Geetu, our server was great!

Even though it was a Monday, people came in and most sat on the patio. We sat inside. It seemed whenever any staff passed the table, they looked over and gave a smile.

There was not a moment we did not feel welcome.

The Italian theme is done well. Italians tunes play, they have Italian beers in bottle and on tap. On tap is a Birra Dolomiti direct from Italy and a Mill Street Birra Sophia Pictured right), named for Sophia Loren, which they describe as a \"classic style Italian pilsner\", which was delicious.

My wife had the Chianti, which was only $6 a glass on Mondays which she enjoyed.

The decor is done really well. Originally it was the boiler room for the units attached to it. The units were factories and in World War 2 made and stored ammunition. Not a great neighborhood to live in back in the 40's. The bar is very well done and I loved how they left some of the old pipes and valves around, as well as the original exposed brick.

Mondays they have a spaghetti and meatball special which is what Teena had. I elected to go for the Spaghetti Carbonara. My wife really enjoyed hers, especially the meatballs. I really enjoyed my dish too. I can only compare it to my own, which is the only other one I have ever had, made just once and was delicious. This one was better.

Reading this you may think that I love this place.

Yes I do. I really hate giving anywhere a 5 but really could find no faults here. Even the bill was a good experience coming with a comedic postcard.

I already know what I am going to have to eat next time I am there, and would stop in for just a drink.

I really hope this place does well as it deserves to."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is stunning. The pizza was great and the service was casual. I would go absolutely go back for drinks, pizza, or both. Patio looked nice too!"}
{"text":"Live in Liberty Village, and Bar Vespa is a solid neighbourhood restaurant--that is to say, the food is decent, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone make a special trip across the city to try it. The food is always good, but it seems to lack a little something that makes you say \"that was a great meal.\" But, the service is always attentive, it's a nice restaurant, and they have decent drink specials.

The pizzas are without a doubt the best items on the menu. However, I've often found the pastas fall a bit short. For example I had penne alla vodka with chicken. The sauce and pasta was good, but a little on the bland side, and could have done with more seasoning. The taste and consistency of the chicken suggested it had been cooked earlier and reheated. And even as someone who has a tendency to cook the sh*t out of chicken, it was dry even by my standards!

Overall--solid restaurant if you live around the neighbourhood and want to go for a pizza and a pint; maybe not worth the trip if you live across the city."}
{"text":"The food was decent but they need new staff. Went there on a Sunday evening to catch up with some girlfriends and our waitress didn't pay any attention to us. She was always off doing something else. It took forever for us to receive our bill and when we received it, it was wrong. Getting her attention to even fix the bill took almost 20 minutes. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the WORST restaurants that I have ever been to.

First time coming her they burnt the Parmesan chicken and I had to wait 20 frigin mins longer to get a new plate-fine.

Second time I ordered the Pasta and Meatballs. WTF?! The meatballs tasted like Dog Sh%T!!!!! So.....I told them that I couldn't eat them. They asked me if I wanted anything else but the taste honestly turned me off for the night (pasta was not too bad).

LAST time I went I ordered the Chicken Parm/Pasta (thought I would give it another try) and it took a whole 40 mins to get it. My boyfriend ordered a measly hamburger and salad WITHOUT BLUE CHEESE and it arrive the same time but FN BURNT and with fries!!! Where is the salad? So.....Salad comes awhile later WITH BLUE CHEESE.

WTF?! Doesn't anyone here listen to our order????!!!

My daughter was served her food-WITHOUT A SMALL FORK TO EAT WITH!!!...Nice...

Later on the wind blew her napkin and it landed on the ground. What happens?
The idiot waitress comes over, picks it up and puts it in her lap...Are you frigin serious? Why not just give her a new one???  

Lastly, we order a Tiramisu and the IDIOT waitress puts it inform of our daughter WITHOUT ANY UNTENSILS....It took about 5 mins to track someone down!!!


These people do not care about there customers nor do they pay attention to BIG AND SMALL details.

Turns out that the waitress was the Manager!!!!! LOL. What a joke."}
{"text":"I came with a couple girlfriends on a Fri night.  It's surprisingly quiet, but that's ok for us.

We ordered a few Appys to share: Deep fried Risotto balls (would recommend), calamari ( I agree with the previous comments: not sure why they added deep fried polenta, could have just give us all calamari), Mussels (which was so-so).

Then, we also had prosciutto pizza (pretty decent pizza) and linguine pest (it's a little heavy on the sauce for me)

And of coz.. we had dessert too: cheesecake (I 'll say this is slightly above average, it's quite smooth, not super heavy, but I feel there is not enough flavor) and the mocha cake (nth special).

Overall, food is not bad... SERVICE was amazing tho!!"}
{"text":"Bar Vespa is not what I expected at all considering the look and the location.
This is now second time I have attempted to sit in the outside patio which had a few table with customers and I was told all the tables where taken...NO reservations on tables.  Her explains toon was very unpolished and not professional at all.

So I tell all you people out there \"don't go\".  There are plenty of other pizza places in walking distance who would love to have you as a customer."}
{"text":"The interior and the patio are really nice. There is definitely a reason why the place is never full when Brazen Head and Williams Landing across the street are bumping at the same time.

While the food is ok, it is simply not worth the price. The service is also not very good, especially for a night when maybe 25% of the restaurant is full.

My biggest pet peeve with any place is when the food is brought out and the server says: \"Hang on, let me grab you some cutlery\" while we are sitting there like idiots drooling over our dishes unable to eat them. This review would have been three stars, but for this irritating hiccup, I am giving it a two. It's Serving 101, which everyone should pass with flying colours before dealing with customers."}
{"text":"Bar Vespa is pretty much the closest restaurant to our place, thankfully it's also fairly okay. Their $10 pizza on Mondays, which covers all of their pizzas by the by, is a pretty decent deal. The balsamic glaze that they're using on the prosciutto pizza is a very poorly done, but the margherita is pretty good (and definitely worth $10). Also, their bread and spicy olive oil to start is tasty.

It's the type of Italian restaurant where you get a pint of Moretti rather than a bottle of wine. All in all, good place to go if you're in Liberty Village, but not a good place to travel to Liberty Village for."}
{"text":"My SO and I stopped in for lunch yesterday at Bar Vespa.  My first visit was during the Yelp event a few months earlier and I was impressed by the service and food.  They did not disappoint the second time around!

The food was great, there were on peculiar things to comment on.  I love their calamari but I did not understand the fried polenta that accompanied the dish.  I would have preferred more calamari than partly fried/soggy polenta.  I also did not understand the uncut romaine lettuce that came with the ceaser salad, it felt like the dish was unfinished.

Aside from that, I loved loved the risotto balls!!!  The bread with the herb and olive oil mix was lovely!

Service was fabulous as usual, the right amount of attentiveness without being annoying.

They have drink specials from 4-7pm!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's raining.  It's pouring.  Let's do some exploring... around Liberty Village!
I still find entertainment in this neighborhood scarce.  After coming here for the Elite event, I wanted to come back and check out their dinner menu and well.  I had also noticed they had a great looking bar!

We started with the Lamb Spaducci, ok, they were the smallest skewers I have ever seen.  They must have been from the smallest lamb ever.  This appetizer was a bit of a miss.

However, the Suppli was deep fried risotto ball perfection.  Crispy but moist and creamy on the inside ($10).

We ordered the the Vespa salad ($11) and it was surprisingly good for salad.  Feta cheese and pine nuts with a large serving of arugula.

The pizza was also way better than expected.  The crust was thin and crispy.  We asked for their chilli oil which is pretty addictive.
The prosciutto pizza ($17) was loaded with toppings ...including more arugula.  At least we got our fill of greens!

For dessert, we had the home-made tiramisu.  It was good.  I can't say it's the best I've ever had.  

I really enjoyed the wine selection here.  The service was just awesome.  Our waitress made great recommendations and she was fun to chat with.
This is a great casual spot for simple Italian."}
{"text":"No huge complaints, other than the service was a tad slow. Food was great - I had the Trattoria Burger. Fortunately we weren't in any kind of rush for a lunch, but given how busy it seemed to be the speed of service didn't make sense."}
{"text":"Went to Bar Vespa last night before a show at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre on the Ex grounds. It was early, about 5pm, and the place was basically empty. We sat on the patio and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly.  The exclusive beer brewed by Mill Street for the bar was great. We shared the field greens salad and the carne pizza, which was fantastic and well sized to share. The house made gelato in chocolate was very nice to finish the meal. Definitely looking forward to visiting this restaurant again the next time I'm in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"I'd only come back on a Wednesday for half price appetizers and get the meatballs. Meatballs are super good, maybe not $9(regular price) for 2 good but half prize on Wednesday its a must. Good pizza and good lasagna. A bit over priced else would get a 4."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise my visit to Bar Vespa was! I think that if I'm hyper critical about one thing, it's my Italian food. I like it old school, by candle light, made by old Italian women who pinch my cheeks and wipe the corners of my mouth and tell me to eat more because I'm too skinny.

Bar Vespa was none of these things - so naturally I was dubious. 

However, what it IS, is a romantic, modern Italian restaurant and wine bar, with exceptional food made by excellent chefs who put incredible spins on classic recipes (without straying too far so that they are unrecognizable). So all things considered I guess I could do without the cheek pinching and someone telling me I'm too skinny.

We arrived early and for a Friday I was glad we did because while it was empty when we arrived, it was packed by the time we left. We did arrive early enough for their Happy hour specials which included a discount on apps and wine. No complaints there!

My girlfriend and I ordered the Calamari to start, which was served with a side of their tomato marinara sauce. As far as calamari goes, it's tough to make this dish remarkable or memorable but I felt they delivered in on par with any other place I've had.

For our mains, my gf went with her staple vegetarian pasta option - butternut squash filled ravioli done with browned butter and sage ($16), and I broke away from my go to Spaghetti and meat balls to try something new and exciting - Pappardelle barolo made with braised short rib, chives, mushrooms and pecorino cheese, tossed in only the jus of the braised short ribs with butter and flour ($22).

My girlfriend, took a few bites of hers and exclaimed that this was likely the best version of her fave dish that she'd ever had (I tried and verified that it was indeed exceptional). My apprehension around my dish vanished the minute I took my first bite as the marriage of seasonings, beef and wide noodles was a flavour explosion in my mouth - I cleaned my dish down to the bowl with little hesitation (I even gave it a proper Italian salute by mopping every drop of sauce up with bread). So decadent, so amazing!

We paid our bills and headed on to our evening plans, only to return several hours later with a group of friends looking for drinks. I ended up being able to sample their cocktail menu and had a Manhattan and a Negroni. The Manhattan wasn't one of my favourites but was still passible, but the Negroni was exceptional - delicious!

BV has been in Liberty Village for quite some time already and with the onslaught of new spots opening up around it, I can see why it's managed to stand the test of time. A great date night spot for good food, good drinks and a great night! I shall return... HUNGRY.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Took a winterlicious opportunity to check out Bar Vespa. I wasn't very impressed. It has a good location and friendly staff but I was disappointed in the menu. As my appetizer I had the sausage and peppers which I imagined being like little sausages with peppers...it was 1 giant sausages on top of a pepper/tomato sauce. My lunch entree was the turkey panini which I could barely bite because it was too toasted. Repeat= negatory"}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service.
I came in with a group of 5 people on a Saturday night. The place wasn't particularly busy and we had reservations. After waiting 45 minutes to be seated at Wish (with a reservation) a couple weeks before, I was pleased when we were seated promptly, but the service went downhill from there.
I was brought pasta instead of the pizza I had ordered and since it would take them half an hour or so to make it for me, I decided to cancel my order and just share with a friend, who had gotten the same thing (which turned out fine, as we were both surprised by how massive the pizza was). Another person is our party discussed her allergies at length with our server who suggested she order a specialty pizza. However, she was brought a regular pizza and had to send it back.
I also had to request a re-fill on my drink three times before it was taken care of. I didn't mind my pizza (I actually thought it was quite good) but I was very disappointed with the service, especially considering the prices."}
{"text":"After attending a successful yelp event, I was excited to try this place out for dinner. For a Saturday night it was a bit slower (we went around 9pm) but it meant we got our food quicker so I didn't care.

We had the Calamari to start, it was amazing... so amazing that we ordered another plate as soon as we had one bite. We also had the risotto balls which were equally delicious. 

For dinner I had the Quattro pizza. It reminded me of Terronis (which is a huge compliment coming from this cat). My friends had the seafood pasta which I sampled and was quite good. 

The server was pleasant and very accommodating to our indecisiveness. 

As I mentioned in my Yelp Event posting, this space is fantastic. Very charming and although it's new, it oozes history and character.

If you are looking for a place for dinner, you cannot go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"The Positives: The ambiance is beautiful. Very historic. Great brick walls and heigh ceilings.

The Negatives: Extremely slow service. We waited twenty minutes for our drink, fourty minutes for our appetizer and an hour and fifteen minutes for our simple pizza. The pizza was very very mediocre. I can't say it was bad, but it wasn't any different from the hundreds of Italian restaurants around.

Overall: Not the high level of service you would expect of a restaurant with such location. It angers me when I see owners land such amazing spots but not provide the service to complement the ambiance. Would I come here again? Not unless I was forced to."}
{"text":"One word; SUPPLI! 
Bar Vespa is one of the latest new restaurants in Liberty Village (along with williams landing). When it first opened my initial reaction was \"oh no, not another mediocre pasta/pizza joint\" but to my surprise, Bar Vespa has impressed me. 
They are also owned by brazen head (or the same company that owns it) and I find the decor a little a little too cold (exposed brick walls, industrial high ceilings with pipes showing, it doesn't look much different from brazen head actually) but their food and service are great. 

First off, their bread with the special mix of spices+ oilve oil is awesome and given before your meals arrive. It's a nice little extra before your main arrives and the servers are always happy to explain what the spices are and they seem very well educated. 

and I am sure most people who's tasted the suppli will agree, their suppli is amazing! These are fried risotto balls with cheese inside. They are big so if you get an order, it could suffice as a small meal. They are delicious. 

Their pizzas are also pretty good. my favourite is the potato pizza which is under their white pizza section. I find their dough to be a little too thin and somewhat tasteless (it also tends to get soggy pretty fast) but their pizza is ok. 
I'm giving it a 4 because their servers are great and pretty much because they have 100% nailed their suppli to be perfectly hot, crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMFG! THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! Never had much luck with Liberty Village restaurants, all are a show but doesn't have good food. But my girlfriend insisted we try a Liberty Village restaurant and Bar Vespa had the best rating and I felt like Italian Food so we came here. 

Boom! We were blown away. The ambience was nice and clean, does not look like a sketchy bar if that's what you were thinking. There were a few tables for a Saturday lunch. We sat down and were surprised it was Winterlicious. I was happy about the $15 for a 3 course lunch! 

And got bread with their homemade mix in front of you oil and spice mix. The bread was cold but very delicious! We kept on eating til our appetizers came. We ordered the risotto balla and the Paranip and Celery Root Soup to start. Both were delicious and cooked just right. Meatballs were really crunchy and yummy.

By the time our mains came we were too full to continue. We had a small bit of the grilled chicken linguine which had a nice creamy sauce and we had a lamb dish which was cooked just right. We had to take it home for dinner and it was a really good dinner as well. All for $30! This is definitely the spot for Winterlicious, regular menu items are worth the price. Will come back soon!

{"text":"I've been riding past this place on my bicycle and practically been carried off by the delicious smell of garlic, tomatoes and blistered pizza crust. When on a bike ride with my boyfriend a few months ago, I convinced him that we should have dinner there.

The inside was welcoming and the hostess seated us on the patio where we ordered some wine, which is quickly and expertly poured from a small carafe into your sparklingly clean wine class. The staff worked together well. This is something I like to see. Nothing pisses me off more than going for a meal and watching one server run their ass of while two others stand and chat. When this happens it's because the staff don't work well together as a team and it leads to terrible service. At Bar Vespa, there was no such tomfoolery. We were visited by several servers who clearly had all communicated about what was going on.

We ordered a Margherita pizza to split and the crust was just as I had imagined it from my bicycle trips-- thin, crispy and lightly blistered with a great tomato sauce and fragrant basil.

We also had these delicious breaded and deep fried olives. I noticed that they are no longer on the menu, but we both agreed that these salty little suckers were delicious. Especially with beer or wine. Breaded Calamari was crispy and hardly a trace of grease.

Overall, I was very impressed with this restaurant and would definitely come back again if in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Portions have gotten smaller, pasta is way too chewy, chicken Parmesan was good but I was left hungry and need to order more and selection is limited. Service is not the greatest and definitely can use some improvement.  I'll give them one more try some time in the future and hopefully they will impress me."}
{"text":"It's convenient if you live in Liberty Village and the wait staff is great.  The food: mediocre at best.

They have a wood burning pizza oven.  Tried the margharita pizza and it wasn't bad, but a bit on the doughy side. Overall cooked well.  I also had the campellini w/ garlic shrimp pasta.  The pasta was a complete mush and looked like it had been sitting under a heating lamp for an eternity.  It broke into pieces when sticking my fork in.  Far overdone, although I don't doubt it may have tasted better fresh.

The waitress did let us know they are completely revising the menu to a more tapas oriented style, so there is still hope.  There isn't too much choice in liberty village and they do have a nice patio, so if you end up here in the near future stick to the pizzas and booze."}
{"text":"A really modern spot, but the pasta isn't great.

Nicole H., Lady Chris P. and I decided to grab some food at the tail end of the Elite party. They were really impressed by the apps that were circulating, so we stayed.

Service was fantastic. I was impressed with the herbed olive oil for the bread, which was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The server also didn't hem and haw when we said we had a check-in deal. He just disappeared, and reappeared a couple minutes later with the cheques changed. 

I had the seafood pasta, which was not great. When it arrived, the mussels were cold and the pasta was just a big gluey clump. The promised arrabiata sauce was quite spicy, but not as flavourful as I'd like. The calimari and shrimp were fine. It was a big dish, I couldn't finish it, but I was annoyed that I fell into the trap of ordering pasta from a restaurant again. It's almost always bad, so why do I keep doing it? I should have realized that pasta wasn't their main thing when I learned that there might be cream in the meatballs.

Nicole and Chris LOVED their respective dishes (trio of crostini with toppings and harvest salad). 

I probably won't go back again. Getting there via TTC is exhausting and the prices don't justify the quality."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good BUT oh my! - wait time at lunch in the empty restaurant was 2 hours!! I mean, maybe the kitchen could be ready for a few people coming in for pre-reserved dinner during their lunch break on a working day?
So don`t even think about coming here for lunch if haven`t got all day - I won`t."}
{"text":"One of my favourite meals I suggested we return on rainy Thursday. 

Reservations were easily made online. 

Even though rainy they have a nice patio with a cover that you would stay dry under. However as the night dims, there is almost zero lighting and hard to see. 

They've changed the menu since I've last been here. No more Spladucci. 

The Calamaritti was very good especially for the value. $8. We also got the cheese stuffe rissoto balls $9 and only 3 big ones. Can share. 

I opted for something different although I craves the penne tartufo again. Instead I got the cream pasta with clams , also available in appetizer size ($9.99 instead of $16.99). But it was bland and tasteless. 

The boys shared a pizza and j would give it a 2. It was soggy on the bottom could be because it's not cooked on a wood or charcoal oven. 
Meh, had better.

I used to really like the place, has a great atmosphere, one of the only decent foods in the area. But seems like the menu is hit or miss, and you really have to pick carefully."}
{"text":"I recommended Bar Vespa to my boss for our team dinner. This is was the week after I had ACL reconstructive surgery on my right knee and was limping around on crutches.The restaurant is 100% wheelchair accessible and staff went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. I ordered the steak. It was slightly on the salty side but was cooked perfectly to my liking and the mixture of spices created an overall appetizing dish! I tasted my co-workers ravioli and we were not impressed. Unlike the steak, the ravioli lacked flavor and was bland. For desert, the Tiramisu was delicious. However, the gelato with marshmallows was a let down :(. The ice cream came melted and the marshmallows overpowered the gelato. The chef took our feedback well though and took the gelato off our bill. Overall a good experience with outstanding service and we will return! Also, try the beer Sophia on tap - apparently mill st. brews it specially just for Bar Vespa!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was excellent. Drinks were reasonably priced. Out of a table of 7 ppl, only 1 person really enjoyed his meal. I'd go for drinks on the patio or something."}
{"text":"Service is great and so r the risotto ballls ( actually they are AMAZING!!!). Beyound that would not order the chicken linguine, unless u enjoy spoonfuls of pestoo!!"}
{"text":"Super good! Delicious, friendly staff, nice design, reasonable prices. Had a great time (like four reasonable times now)."}
{"text":"Bar Vespa is a hidden treasure in Liberty Village.  They have great food & service.  It's hardly ever super busy and it also has a great atmosphere.  They have lots of selections on their menu also."}
{"text":"Hit this place up for an Elite event and it was super cute!

The drinks had my head swimming early on and the bites were actually pretty tasty. So much so in fact that the hubs and I scoped out where the food was actually being released from and then planted ourselves there for the majority of the night and were the first people served off the platters.

What? Mamma didn't have to cook dinner that night.

YOU DON'T KNOW ME."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I explored Liberty Village. Friends and I were going to the Amphitheater for a concert so we decided to have dinner somewhere close. Thanks to Yelp, I found Bar Vespa.

Reservations can be made on-line, which is quite convenient. That being said, when we arrived at seven o'clock tonight (Sat) the place was not too crowded.

Service was superb.

The menu had a variety of items that were reasonably priced. I had the butternut squash ravioli; it was quite tasty!

I'm a fan.
Would love to check out the other joints around.
It seems like quite the happening 'hood."}
{"text":"okay this was the second attempt at this place! 

FYI if you're coming here after a Toronto FC MLS match be prepared to wait as this joint can get crowded.  I must say the second time around Bar Vespa prevailed and is now in my good books, perhaps it was the efficiency of the waitress we had, and w/out her this place would fall to shambles....... Since my buddy and I wanted to hit as many bars without getting wasted we decided to have some drinks and food, and its off to the next venue! 

For food, he had the Tuscan Fries, and as always it was delish. 
I on the other hand ordered their Calamari Frite, which was risk that paid off well!!! 
I've had calamari at other places, but Vespa makes it unique.  Perfected fried, and not a lot of breaded batter (which most places tend to do)  The light, not overwhelming marinara sauce complimented the dish! and I was definitely impressed! for drinks my buddy had a beer, and I resorted to their 60z... NOT 9oz glass of red............... 
............................

.........................................Part 1 of bar hop concluded.......NEXT!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place , as it's right behind my condo. Menu looked great, atmosphere was nice. I ordered a salad. A plain Cesar salad. 40 minutes later still nothing. Couldn't believe it. The kicker was the place was empty! It wasn't even busy and I waited 40 minutes then decided to just get up and leave, I had somewhere to be and didn't think it would take an hour to bring me some lettuce and croutons."}
{"text":"Food was really good, you could taste the freshness.

I went around 230p, place was not busy but that made for a better time.

I would go back again, App with Entree about $40.00 per head"}
{"text":"The first time I came to Vespa I fell in love. I had a wonderful waiter who was from America that was so personable and informative about the menu and the drinks that I was convinced this would be my new spots; especially since it is just feet from my door. The Wednesday night specials are fabulous, half off appetizers seemed like a slam dunk. Sadly, the second time around my opinion changed. Vespa is in my opinion a typical \"Liberty Village\" overpriced restaurant that is below par. The Pizza was average, not worth the $15.00 with a $2.00 add on for basil. I can buy a PLANT of basil for $1.00, give me a break. The Lasagna slice was an embarrassment. My fiancé finished it in under 2 minutes, and he isn't a huge guy. The portion was so tiny, I'm Italian and that's not the way we do things. The waitress told us about the $1 an ounce wine special, but failed to mention that it was for only \"house wine.\" Needless to say I was totally underwhelmed by the food, nothing stood out with great flavor that we tried. I am not going to comment on the Pizza because I did change an ingredient, but I highly doubt in any case I would think it was worth the $15.00. Unless it is a Wednesday....venture outside your door and leave the Village for good Italian food and don't waste your money here. Keep on Moving! Not worth the $58.00, but the marinara was very good, it had chunks of tomatoes in it...not $58.00 worth good though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Bar Vespa.

Came here with a fellow yelper for dinner last Saturday.

Decor/Ambiance was just as great as I remembered from the elite party event. Everything is dark and kind of sexy, but they have a few widescreen tvs playing the hockey game which made the place feel more casual and a bit less pretentious than I was expecting.

I had the Vespa Salad to start (feta cheese, grape tomatoes, pine nuts & balsamic dressing). Nicely presented and tasty enough.

I tried the Mussels (Cozza alla Marinara) for my main. The broth was absolutely delish. A couple of the mussels weren't cleaned quite properly as I got a few sandy bits in my mouth, but otherwise it was a really nice dish.

The wine selection here is adequate with a very good selection of reasonably priced ($40ish) bottles. Mostly Italian (obviously) and for some reason California wines.

They have a really nice cocktail and martini selection here too. The ones I remember sampling from the elite party were impressive (bellini, recluta).

The service was a bit over the top (too many check ups/interruptions), but I'm assuming they were trying extra hard because they were aware we were going to YELP about it. Staff were really nice and smiley and even made jokes about my DC's Movember-stache (behind his back, obviously)

Overall, Bar Vespa is a cool place and I would return if it was more centrally located."}
{"text":"Happen when I was in this area. Came here for Mac n Cheese festival but turned out it was so crowded so I gave up and found a place to have some food. I think they have nice location with amazing patio. There is long line up for patio seating but if there are always some available inside. The place is pretty cool itself, cool with the bar in the middle. I had Pappardelle and it was amazing. The beef was so soft with ragu sauce. Service is pretty quick and nice. I give 3 stars because the menu wasn't clear and the food size. I felt i was rip-off little bit because I didn't expect to pay too much for small size. After that, I still felt. I might reconsider if I should go back or not =/"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get Romano style pizza and the Thursday deals of pizza and beer for $15 are awesome,  but the rest of the menu is a bit of a hit and miss. 

The Diavollo pizza has lots of pork on it and not too spicy.  Service can be a bit slow,  but the place usually is not at capacity.  Margheritta pizza does not have enough Fior De Latte and also skimpy on the cheese.  The Spinach pizza is very good.  

They have to bring up their game if they are to compete with the great establishments in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"I came back a couple weeks ago with a fellow Yelper to use the gift card I had won at the elite event. I had made a reservation ahead of time, but it wasn't necessary as there were many tables available. Maybe we missed the rush having an 8pm dinner?

The manager came over to say hi and to get us going then our regular server took over. The service was great and all of the staff we saw throughout the night were quite friendly. 

We took forever to decide what to order as we kept distracting ourselves with conversation. Finally we decided to go with a bottle of a California red to get us going. I started with the caesar salad. The presentation was interesting as the salad was sort of deconstructed. there was one large heart of lettuce on top of the bed of lettuce along with a whole crustini acting as a crouton.

I had a spaghetti dish for my main. It was solid. It didn't blow me away like much of the food did at the elite event but it totally hit the spot.

After dinner we were left to finish our bottle of wine and conversation and weren't rushed out the door.

Nov. 30-day challenge 24/30"}
{"text":"First off, the only reason it even gets 3 stars is because the food is fantastic. The first time I was here it was a quick dinner and I didn't have much to say though the pizza i had was great.

Second time, was a nightmare. Food was still fantastic but the service was atrocious. To put it in my friends words \"it looks like they took a bunch of random people and told them to run the restaurant for a reality show.\" Nobody knew what they were doing. There were tons of tables open, but yet people were waiting to be seated... once we got seated it was a terrible table in hidden in the back so we opted to sit at the empty bar. It took way too long to even get menus, and to order and then my Caesar had no rim or lime or straw and he never came by to ask how everything was. He forgot to get us water as well. I've been in the service industry before, I know how it works so when I'm hard on the service it's within reason and I do take into account the staff-customer ratio. 

all in all; the amount of time between getting menus, being asked for our orders, things being forgotten and never once being asked how our food was just too long for how empty it was. Even they knew the had been lacking on service because one of the only people who seemed to know what they were doing actually comped out appetizer which was appreciated and deserved to be noted.

The food will likely bring me back here, but I would keep my expectations for service at a minimum."}
{"text":"We came for a Sunday lunch.  The place was quiet and comfortable for our 2 small kids. Every dish we tried was tasty.  Even the kid's cheese pizza was great."}
{"text":"The location is in liberty village, I came here with a moderate sized group (8 people) for lunch. I found it surprising that they did not serve bread after we ordered, and the waiter said that it would be additional cost. We still ordered some, I didn't think the bread was premium that it warranted a charge. The wait time was also a bit long, especially after we told them that we were in a rush, and that the place was pretty empty. I would've understand a longer wait time if the place was packed, but it wasn't the case.

I ordered the beet salad with salmon; I found the grapefruit and ricotta cheese pairing to be really nice and refreshing. The salmon was a bit overcharred and overcooked, which took away from the dish. I found the portion size to be on the smaller end based on the price of the dish.

Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with my dish; the other people had pizza in my group and they seemed to have enjoyed it. Maybe I chose the wrong dish to order, so I will consider going back in the future for their pizza."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this page while shopping at West Elm. Tried a some beers, and had a couple of small plates. They have Weihenstephan Vitus on tap! nice! one of my favorites. So refreshing. Tried meatball plate and risotto ball plate. Meatballs were amazing, but the risotto wasn't as great."}
{"text":"Sub-par if you're a fan of real Italian style pizza. Had Panago right after this meal"}
{"text":"Before the soccer game Friday evening, Gord and I had supper at Bar Vespa.  We haven't been since it opened last year.

We both had a Mill Street Birra Sophia ... it was tasty.

It was packed but we managed to grab a couple seats at the bar.

They started us with a mixture of herbs and olive oil and bread.  I liked it ... Gord didn't.

I had Chicken Vespa (chicken parm) with a side of pasta.  They were good ... I love tomatoes but it was a lot of tomato.  I'd get roasted potatoes as the side next time.

Gord ordered the Pollo Pancetta with side Caesar salad. He said it was good but wasn't right on."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time was great a bit on the pricy side but delicious pizza. 

Second time was abysmal ordered a pasta and it was the smallest serving ever not even a meal and cost me $16. I had to go get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was looking for not-delivery pizza last nite and ended up walking through Liberty Village. 
Bar Vespa seemed like a low key neighborhood joint and we walked in expecting a just above average experience. 
I can tell you my wife and I were absolutely delighted to have been so profoundly mistaken.
Service was attentive: the barman took our order and made sure our drinks were delivered promptly and we're mixed just right.
He pointed out the Thursday pizza/beer special and while my wife picked the $7.00 Cozza (mussels, tomato, leek and fresh herbs), I was sold on the $15 Magherita and craft pint.
Besides from the great price, we were both impressed with the ambiance. The patio where we sat was comfortable and roomy, nicely located in a not so busy corner.
The food came just as we finished our drinks and while the mussels could have been warmer, the pizza was without a fault.
Definately on my short list."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions. The menu, food and staff is generally quite good.
However,
Do not come here after a Toronto FC match or any large event in the area. They basically throw out their menu and digress to the level of a pizza stand with a lousy abridged menu with 5 options. They say that they can not service so many people so they offer only a few menu items. I think they just want to cash in on the crowds so they've sacrificed their quality for volume. For this I must give them a 3."}
{"text":"The best meal at Bar Vespa (if you're on a budget like me) is one pizza (for two people - they're big) and a couple pints of Sophia beer, which is $4-5/pint.

I did try the veal panini once -- it was so over-done... like rubber. When I asked for a new one, it was the same. (Veal should melt in your mouth.) So I avoid the panini section of the menu now."}
{"text":"Really disappointing- my parents were visiting and it was their last meal before their long haul flight home. As we live in the area of liberty village, bar vespa always appears to be busy with a good atmosphere so we figured to try it. 
The waitress was an absolute calamity, just a mess, spilling water and knocking things over just down right awkward.......
I ordered the Italian salad with \"grilled chicken\"   Now I have a MASSIVE problem with a restaurant when they  serve processed chicken! It really really bothers me. It was the salted water injected rubbery \"M&M\" frozen chicken breast, just downright cheap and lazy serving this !! If I wanted fake rubber chicken in a salad I would have gone to Mc Donalds for half the price! Topped off with salad dressing that came right from a bottle. how hard is it for a kitchen to whip up a fresh salad dressing and serve real chicken. I will never ever return ! The Cost 4 main dishes and 4 waters came t $80 for lunch. A bit of a rip off considering the quality"}
{"text":"Our waitress (this pretty asian woman) HATED her life and was very unpleasant. She literally slammed our menus and plates down in front of us with no greeting. I think that's the first time ever my boyfriend has given less than 15% as a tip in years. My mussels were fine but his gluten free pizza was flat, flavourless and a whopping $20. They shut down the kitchens for an hour but didn't tell us until we sat down- they gave us about 5 seconds to order. This weird friend of the owners started rambling into his microphone as a substitute for the music being shut off. Just not a good experience. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here two weeks ago, Friday night Sept 23rd. I wanted to visit because of a review I read on Sweetspot.ca, so I took my boyfriend here! Free street parking also :) :) 

We came here for drinks. I had the Dolomiti (which was absolutely awesome), and my bf had the Sophia, which was good too. We shared a plate of the Calamaretti. I usually don't like fried seafoods due to the batter, but theirs was reeeeaalllyyy gooooddd. There were lots of squid meat, and they weren't tiny! And the spicy marinara was reeally really super. 

Before the Calamaretti came, the server gave us a plate of bread and some.. butter..ish something, spices from somewhere in yellow liquid, I'm guessing it's melted butter. I don't remember what it was, sorry! And I'm someone who doesn't eat bread with butter, just because I don't like that greasy taste, but this was SOOOOO yummy. I was swirling my bread in that \"butter\", it was gooooddddd.

All the waiters there were very nice. I was walking to the washroom downstairs, and a waitress casually said, \"Hi, how's it going?\" as she was walking to the kitchen, downstairs too. We had like a 45sec convo :p

I reeally really like it there! Clean, elegant, waiters were friendly, food was good. Also, when we were there... there were only maybe 5 other tables filled so it was a little quiet and I like that a lot :) Reminder that this was two weeks ago, and not Sept 30 like Mary's review!"}
