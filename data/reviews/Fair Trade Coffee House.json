{"text":"The espresso was just disappointing. I probably had my hopes set a little too high, but Fair Trade Coffee did not beat out Starbucks in my mind which in my opinion is where the bar is set if you want to be a coffee shop. Granted they do serve their espresso in a variety of flavored drinks, but I got both a shot of espresso and a mocha. I ended up pouring the espresso shot into the mocha and then throwing the new more sinister concoction away. I even asked the clerk behind the counter about the coffee before I drank it and he spewed something about it being light and aromatic but he clearly didn't have any clue what he was talking about. Espresso is supposed to taste like you don't want to stop drinking it and not like you want to stop drinking it as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Near the end of our downtown journey we wanted some sweet. We hopped into Fair Trade Coffee House and I got a muffin and a diet coke, my brother got an iced chai and a scone and total it came out to $9.75. So average coffee house prices.   They had a nice selection of sweets and a really nice atmosphere. It's littered with college kids and their laptops.  Service was friendly and our sweets were yummy. Will stop again when I'm in that part of town."}
{"text":"Coffee shop/cafe on state street.   You're going here to do some studying/work, so What You Need To Know  1.  Very easy to get a seat in the early afternoon/late evenings.  During winter afternoons it's very empty.  Who wants to walk all the way out there in the cold, right?  2.  Lots of places to plug in.  Sit by the wall and you'll find one.  3.  Two dollars for a coffee.  Dollar refills.  Coffee is standard imitation starbucks.    4.  Clean.  Bathroom is always impeccable.  I've been here a million times and I've NEVER found the bathroom dirty.  5.  WIFI is pretty reliable, but it can be slow at times.  Just ask the staff to reset it if you can't get on.  Best to ask around and be able to say a bunch of people can't get on.  Um, anything else?  This place is a great study spot."}
{"text":"Never been to a better coffee shop! The staff here are even better than the coffee!! I also enjoyed one of their many vegan options & had the Zucchini muffin. ..yummm. Come enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Fair Trade is one of my favorite cafes to go to, mainly because they offer a nice selection of coffees, pastries and foods. In a pinch you could even have a semblance of lunch here, unlike Espresso or chain-y coffee places around.  I recommend the spinach mushroom quiche.. :-) I like the big window for people watching and the seating out front to sit at during the summer.. The people who work here are all nice and helpful, too. Overall, while its not necessarily your most interesting coffee shop around, its a nice setting to get work done, camp out on your laptop (as I'm doing there right now), or just people-watch at one of the busier corners of State St."}
{"text":"Honestly the BEST latte I've ever had in town. It's also a great place to study. Since there aren't too many coffee shops on campus, I've tried most of them over the course of years. I learned that it's hard for a coffee shop to have both a great coffee/tea selection AND a cozy atmosphere, yet this place does both."}
{"text":"Had a very good chicken sandwich with some sort of roasted pepper pesto sauce that was excellent.  Very good coffee as well, served in a cool setting with lots of unique art on the walls. Met the owners; great people who also own another independent coffee house down the street - Michelangelo's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to work at a nice coffee place after a huge lunch. The decor is nice, and we managed to find this nice quiet spot in the back that's very conducive for work.  However, when I get my iced mocha and my bf his iced coffee, we were sorely disappointed. It's worse than Starbucks, and that's pretty much the standard. The iced mocha tasted like iced chocolate soy milk (I got soy milk instead of regular milk). It was too sweet, too creamy. I doubt there was much coffee in it at all. I'm now struggling to finish it and that's just not how mocha is supposed to be. At most places, I'm finishing up the iced mocha so quickly like it's water. That's just how I decide what's good mocha and what's not. This place clearly has pretty bad coffee but people still come here probably because of the name Fair Trade and the nice environment for work/chilling out."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!  The coffee is lovely, the ambiance is calm, the back patio is wonderous.  Great place to study and drink coffee."}
{"text":"There is nothing inherently wrong with the cafe but the chai, which is my usual drink, is rather weak so I can't rate it that high.  It has lots of seating and free wifi and the back porch is really lovely.  I've only had some of their cookies which were all tasty but I can't rate their sandwiches and whatnot."}
{"text":"I love Fair Trade. The atmosphere is great, especially in the back near the fireplace, and the coffee is excellent. But the customer service is lacking. While studying on a busy Saturday I was approached by the owner and asked if I could please purchase something or leave because of customers looking for a place to sit. I, waiting for a friend to return and not wanting to leave our computers/phones unattended, waited to purchase a drink. I was approached a second time and scolded for still not having bought anything. I explained to the owner my plan to wait for my friend, but she would not listen. To make this worse, there is a sign in Fair Trade that says \"Thieves are afoot. Do not leave valuables unattended.\" Interesting how that's what I was trying to do but I was chided for it. I am not impressed!"}
{"text":"In a world of same and standard, FTCH is a wonderful touchstone to remember what a coffee house is supposed to be.  A comfortable place to visit, drink, nosh, and waste a morning just enjoying the time, space and faces around you.    The team behind the counter - Rock Stars... Nice, Friendly and can quick!  The coffee is top notch!  Not overly roasted at all.  It roasted perfectly, brew and pulled with perfection so as not bring any harshness to the cups.  The coffee is bold but mellow enough to enjoy all the edges of the flavors profile...  It is nutty and sweet, while ever so slightly rich and acidic...  It is like a great glass of drinkable wine (get drunk wine) because you can just keep drinking it!  Have not tried the food, but it all smelled and looked wonderful.  I did not see one plate with anything left for the trash- Great sign of great food!  Thanks for the awesome brew!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food options for State Street, including big delicious muffins, bars, several grilled sandwiches, and an excellent salad (just order without the cheese). And there is a vegan chocolate cheesecake that does not really taste like cheesecake at all, but it is a truly well done vegan chocolate cake with a ganache-like bottom layer and then a moist, light cakey layer. Expensive but good."}
{"text":"A good variety of strong well sourced coffees in downtown Madison in State Street. Didn't eat but baked goods sure looked tasty.  Not mellow vibe in a comfortable space."}
{"text":"I have LOVED Fair Trade Coffeehouse since an undergrad!! That is about 8 years, mind you. :) 8 years of love, which probably makes me and FTC fairly committed while I continue to live in Madison!  The food is fantastic, the coffee is alright, but well sourced and prepared. The staff is friendly, helpful, and all around fantastic 90% of the time.   Summer reveals patio seating right on State Street, and a private back patio with just a few seats - but it LOVELY!! Winter is so cozy!! The fireplace is alive and crackling, and if I can trek through the mounds of snow and the blustery, icey winds to State Street, I try and snag that space.   I find it a good mix of students (during fall and spring terms) and the general public, except for those pesky weekends during special events or game days. What can you do, though? Am I right?  Whether it's a day off, after work pick me up with a good book or work assignment, FTC is one of my TOP go-to's for enjoyment and productivity!"}
{"text":"The coffee is awesome no bitter aftertaste *cough Starbucks cough* Taking a vaction day from work. Decided after working out I deserve a great cup of coffee and a huge fattening delicious muffin. Love the shop, bright inviting. The poor girl very patient as I couldn't decide what yummy pastry I wanted.  I so recommend big ups to the staff all so nice. Also love the free wifi which is awesome so I can check  reviews on nail salons for a pedi."}
{"text":"Needed a little mid afternoon java jolt while perusing along State St one day and this coffee shop was recommended by another local shop.  I was immediately welcomed by a lovely lady, who I came to find out was the owner. She was so gracious and helped me pick out my afternoon treat which was a Gluten Free Pumpkin Chocolate muffin and a dark roast coffee. WOW! Both were delish and left my taste buds singing. The muffin was moist and the coffee was strong with no bitter after taste. There is plenty of seating in this place with a little hide away in the back. As stated in other reviews, it is a good place to do school work or writing with free wifi.  The place was clean and for $5 I was fueled up and ready to get back to State street shopping. I will for sure go here again!! Love you Fair Trade Coffee!!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Roomy, lots of seating, friendly cashiers. I also always love places that don't make you ask for water. The bathroom was really clean too. I got a coffee and vegan (yay!) zucchini bread. Both were very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Since today is Fair Trade's 12 year anniversary (as I found out from the barista who was passing around free birthday cookies to seated customers) it seems appropriate to sing their praises like I've been meaning to do for a while.   As I always preface, I am writing as a vegan who is exploring Madison's vegan options at various restaurants, pubs, and cafes. Fair Trade's fair trade business model is likely to appeal to most vegans. For those of you who like a mix of people, you'll find students, families, young professionals, and older folks here. Plenty of interesting people to strike up a conversation with if the spirit moves you. There is always interesting art on the wall and plenty of people watching on State Street if you get a good seat by the front window. In the back you'll find a cozier, more private area complete with a fireplace and a good den vibe. The staff have always been friendly and ready to return a smile. The place is clear and the spacious, open structure of the main seating area makes you feel less crowded than you usually will be at this popular spot.   Most importantly for you vegans, Fair Trade is the best cafe I have found for delicious vegan pastries. Each one I've tried so far has been amazing...like, \"How did they do this??\" amazing. I'm not gluten-free, but I've heard that their gluten-free options will not disappoint. Here are some examples of the vegan items I've tried: apple pie (my favorite), zucchini muffins, vegan bar (rice/oats, peanut butter, chocolate, agave), and chocolate cheesecake. If you're looking for something more filling than pastries, you will love Fair Trades panini-grilled sandwiches, \"The Vegan\" and \"Sundried Tomato.\" No, you can't have the black bean burger since it's made with egg, but soon Fair Trade is going to be offering kale/quinoa burgers so there you have it. Other menu options for you vegans include dairy-free milk for your espresso drinks and smoothies.   I'll definitely be at Fair Trade a lot. Can't wait to see what other vegan items they add to their menu!"}
{"text":"Warm environment, great coffee and large selection of teas. Very conducive to studying/doing work - they're always playing nice & relaxin' music. Lots of vegan/veg options and make sure to try the vegan zucchini muffin it's so perfect and I'm not even vegan! The staff are so kind and helpful, makes this place my favorite coffee shop on state."}
{"text":"Fair Trade, smack in the middle of State Street, is one of my favorite coffee shops. There are an equal number of people working alone as there are happily chatting pairs, but somehow it never seems too noisy. I usually go for coffee, tea, or a pastry, but I popped in last Saturday wanting something more substantial.   I've never had much luck with vegetarian and vegan options at restaurants. Wait, let me revise that statement: I've never had much luck with food that's advertised as being vegan and vegetarian. It seems uniquely American that we over-label food that way, doesn't it? In a lot of other cultures those terms, or other mentions of restrictions or prohibitions relating to diet, are either unstated or innately understood (Everyone knows that when you eat near a temple, nothing will be cooked with meat.  Or that you never eat meat for breakfast. Or that nothing is ever cooked with pork because one's religion prohibits it.) OK, back to Fair Trade.   So after perusing the menu and recalling all the meat I'd eaten the previous day, I decided on the Vegan Sandwich which sells for a little under $6. Immediately after ordering it, I remembered the last \"vegan\" and \"vegetarian\" items I'd ordered from a restaurant and began to regret my decision, remembering piles of raw vegetables next to piles of grilled vegetables and dry slabs of tempeh. That was until the sandwich arrived at the end of the counter. It was good-sized and served on crisp looking French bread. I took my sandwich to a table overlooking the quaint courtyard out back (which, unfortunately, it was just a teeny bit too cold to sit in).   After letting the sandwich cool for a few moments, still expecting something that replaced flavor with \"vegan,\" I bit into it. Amazing! The sandwich was perfectly grilled, the roasted red peppers were just pickled enough, the spinach was fresh, and the hummus spread on both sides of the bread was delightfully garlicky. The proportions of everything were just right. How many times have you ordered a veggie sandwich (or a sandwich with meat and veggies) and there was so much crammed into it that it all fell out onto your plate? With the Vegan Sandwich that wasn't a problem. I savored every bite of it and made a mental note that if I'm ever downtown and my stomach starts growling for something healthy and affordable, I should go to Fair Trade.   What did I order? The Vegan Sandwich, ~ $6  How was it? Great!  How was the customer service? The two women working at the front counter that I spoke to were both very friendly. My sandwich was grilled and delivered promptly in spite of the coffee shop being packed."}
{"text":"I don't have very much to say about this spot as I have a pretty neutral feeling overall about this place. I generally felt like it was a decent coffee shop but not memorable. Not a bad place to work. The coffee was okay. Staff was okay. The ambience was also fairly neutral. Fairly well lit and a lot of small tables for individual work. I didn't have a pastry this time, but they did look fairly appetizing so perhaps that might improve my feelings about the place."}
{"text":"Being in Madison to protest Scott Walker this past weekend was like being back in my leftist college days again.  Not because I went to Bucky U, but because of the \"we might actually win this one\" vibe.    Though there was a difference between then (East Lansing in the mid-1990s) and now.  Back then I used to boycott Starbucks because they didn't use Fair Trade products.  Had this place existed in my college days, I would have been a regular on name and ethics alone (except their cash only policy might have been a problem to my credit happy self).  Nowadays, I'll still bypass the mermaid for an indie shop if possible but the big chain changed company policy, so I changed my buying habits.  But one thing still bothers me about the world's coffee giant - its uniformity.  In the name of corporate branding, all Starbucks stores look generally the same with no \"local flavor\" (to borrow the Yelp term) about them.  And, unfortunately, this jumbo local coffee house (the amount of seating is immense) is similar.  In fact the whole place seemed sterile, uniform and big businesslike.  There were no flyers for local bands.  No local art.  No local 'zines to be perused.  There seemed to be nothing Madisonian about it.  However, the staff, all clad in UW red for solidarity with the marchers (though I do wish the store would have done something more the just this symbolic act and putting a sign denoting suppot behind the register), did an outstanding, efficient, assembly line job of getting a long line out the door quickly.  This was especially impressive since it's not every day that 300,000 people descending on Madison to scream at the Governor to resign.  And my peppermint tea was very good.  The way they stick the bag to a stirrer to let it seep is ingenious (is Wisconsin famous for its Engineering program?).  But my spinach and cheddar sandwich was as flavorless as the decor.  In Wisconsin.  Where cheese is king!  A cheddar sandwich should be impossible to mess up.  And it was tiny.  Not nearly as good as the food at Starbucks.    Now maybe since I'm older I now enjoy the taste of exploitation or something, but I would have loved the best of both worlds - a good coffee shop light food offering in a pleasant setting.  This wasn't it."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and very good food. Free, reliable WiFi, lots of seating, and a fun atmosphere. Generally one of the quieter coffeeshops, so more conducive to studying, and if you want to people-watch, they have lovely windows up front.  Only complaint is that their drinks are small for the price you pay, but always delicious. Very clean and friendly and a great option if you need to plug in."}
{"text":"EXT - STATE STREET - COLD SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN LATE MAY  (a tumbleweed blows across the intersection of State and Gilman)  Aaron: Where is everyone? This place is a ghost town....and it's Saturday.  Yelp: Looking for an afternoon bite?  Aaron: Yes I am, actually. Let me take refuge at Fair Trade Coffee from this wintery day!  INT - FAIR TRADE COFFEE - AFTERNOON  (Everybody from the metro Madison area is present, busy knitting, talking about organic churches, and staring mindlessly into MacBooks.)  Aaron: Hmmm. Well, I found everyone. Hopefully I can get a seat. And some food.  Menu: LOL, not so fast! A sandwich will be an hour's wage, please!:)  (Avoiding the bank breaking statements of the colorful menu board, Aaron nervously stares at the \"Vegan Bar\" in the display case. He's very hungry, but for some reason this \"Vegan Bar\" looks to be the only thing within his budget that will appease his taste buds.)  Employee: (with coarse, inhospitable voice) Hi, what would you like?  Aaron: (bashfully) Can I have a Vegan Bar and a tall Grasshopper Mocha?  Employee: For here?  Aaron: (trying to be lighthearted) Yes please...if I can find a spot!  Employee: (even less hospitably) We'll find you something. That'll be $8.58.  Aaron: (dies)  END --- Long, poorly written video script summarized: This place was packed. I felt rushed and unwelcome. The food/coffee is expensive. Lot of people just milling around inside. The drink was frufru, so it's hard to mess up, but it wasn't bad. The vegan bar tasted vegan...but not bad. Overall, I don't care enough about expensive names like *fair trade*, *organic*, or *vegan* to pay for them, but if that's your thing, that's your thing. I probably won't come here very often though."}
{"text":"The overall atmosphere is incredible, and the service is about as friendly as it gets! The vegan bars are incredible! Also, they have bicycle benefits so it's an awesome deal! Nice space, and no worries about making a sustainable purchase, they have your back!"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly pleased with Fair Trade.  On a sweltering day in June, the AC was awesome.  There are many tables--which I imagine fill up when students are around--and a handful of comfy chairs.  There are some outlets, but not as many as I'd expect at what I'd presume is a hot study spot.  I ate a decent baklava, which was huge for the price I paid ($2.50).  If I lived in the area I'd go back to Fair Trade as well as Michelangelo's."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain or crow about.  I loved the espresso (five stars!), my partner didn't (too bitter - no stars!).  So I guess I'm complaining and crowing."}
{"text":"I have been several times this year, while I'm in Madison. Both times my sister and I ordered coffee drinks. I ordered an iced latte and she had a flavored coffee. Both were perfect. Exactly the way we ordered. No complaints. The barista was very friendly, helpful and funny."}
{"text":"The coffee is okay (not amazing, but you can feel good about yourself for drinking it because it's fair trade), but the staff is intermittently rude or nice. There's this one dude who at least worked there a while ago who yelled at me for ordering a \"mint mocha\" instead of a \"grasshopper,\" as it's called on their menu. I didn't go back there again for a long time.  The vegan peanut butter chocolate bars are amazing, though - and really easy to make at home should you be so inclined."}
{"text":"My favorite of the State Street coffee shops.  It's about mid-way between the Capitol and Campus so it's half business half pleasure  Why it's superior to Espresso Royale, Steep and Brew and Starbucks: -sandwiches are bomb -tons of VEGAN and gluten free options  (the vegan bar is a mass of peanutty chocolately richness) -fair-trade coffee! -the best people watching--grad student types mostly--gives it a fun, interactive -but laid-back vibe.  No one will give you dirty looks for talking with friends but it's quiet enough to study -super friendly staff   What it's missing:  -It's more expensive (\"the real price of coffee!\" shout the hippies) -It has not stamp card so no reward for customer loyalty"}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. If you want a low-key cafe to study at during the evening, this is the place to go. The treats are also yummy but are quite expensive in comparison to other coffee shops. One thing I do not like about Fair Trade is the lack of a rewards system. Sometimes I go to Barriques or Steepery instead because they use Belly. I feel as a regular patron, they could at least have a punchcard to reward those of us that come frequently to their establishment."}
{"text":"An ode to my favorite coffee shop from my undergrad days at UW-Madison.   I used to live in a hole in the wall across the street from this coffee shop, I lived above the Jamba Juice on State Street.  As a broke college student, with no parents to live off of, and making $7 per hour, I wasn't a fan of Starbucks.  Both being students, this coffee shop was where hubs and I \"dated\" over textbooks and highlighters and mounds of rough drafts (we were too broke for those newfangled laptops).  But enough of the nostalgia, on to the review.   Fair Trade was my first experience drinking Mocha, and I have been hooked ever since.  Considering my \"first time\" was here, it basically has set the standard as far as what I look for in coffee and fancy caffeinated drinks.  There is no bitterness to their Mochas, it is smooth and creamy and eyelid opening.  Just the way I like on a long night of studying.    There are few comfy seats, mostly tables and chairs for the hardcore study sessions and writing papers, but position yourself at a table near the window and eye the cozy chairs like a shark, and you'll get yourself a seat in a good half hour, unless your competition is the student with the ginormous book bag who plans to hunker down.   They have a decent deli selection also, their cheesecakes are a perfect coffee match.  Prices are affordable, and as a regular I was \"hooked up\" more than a few times with a discount and an eye wink.    Just about all of State Street can have the heart fluttering effect on me when hubs and I make our returns to campus, but Fair Trade has a special place in my memories."}
{"text":"Recently under new management/ownership, the revamp of this coffee shop (unsure if its the same name as before or not) is a force to be reckoned with!  The new owners have taken over their new spot and decided to do most (or maybe all? I'm not sure) of the baking themselves. Great call. The baked goods stand above and beyond most of the other coffee shops in town, who stock a lot of the same items form the same bakeries around town despite being independents. The breakfast sandwich was to die for, AND   MOST IMPORTANTLY  They serve an amazing Nitro Cold Brew!  Great atmosphere to get \"work from home\" done, or if you are an actual student a little bit of studying. I am here often and I cannot think of a place I like better to work out of downtown."}
{"text":"Lots of seating, super friendly staff, quick service. The food was yummy - I had a vegan zucchini muffin (they heated it up in the microwave for me, easy), a coffee and a pesto chicken sandwich. My favorite was the muffin -- yum! Great place to study -- good lighting and not too loud during the day (in the summer  )"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their apple pie. I live in Chicago and I come here every time I'm in town. The ambience is great and the staff is always kind. Great chill spot."}
{"text":"Cute decor, quiet/academic ambiance, good music, fair trade products, yummy desserts... this place is quickly becoming my favorite Madison coffee shop. (Not that I'm in Madison *all* that often...)  It's situated on State St., so it's kind of centrally located to where I usually am when I'm in Madison. And who doesn't like little independent spots like this? I'd rather hit up a local place than a Starbucks any day of the week. (Places like Fair Trade Coffee have far more character and a far better vibe than a place like Starbucks could ever, ever have, IMHO.)  Worth noting is that Fair Trade is a cash-only coffee shop, but they do have an ATM available... unlike some other cash only spots. (This infuriates me... when cash only spots don't have ATMs.)  Three cheers for Fair Trade in Madison! :)"}
{"text":"I have a certain affection for coffee shops that aren't mega chains.  Now don't get me wrong I spend a great deal of time in mega chains but I really enjoy the \"regular\" coffee shops.  Well after dinner I decided to step into Fair Trade.  First thing I noticed where all of the people that were on their laptops with their ipods plugged in their ear.  It so made me recall the college days (pre laptops and ipods)   I also noticed that I was able to order a tall coffee for $2.00.  WOW!! As someone that drinks wayyy to much coffee this was great.   I noticed that they have a garden patio so when it warms up people can come and literally spend all day.  Very nice.  One thing to remember..don't even THINK about using a debit/credit card.  Cash only!  (ATM right outside)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee houses in Madison.  I highly recommend getting a \"chai charger\".  Chai tea with two shots of espresso for good measure :)"}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop on state street with delicious pastries and paninis. The people are what makes this coffee shop great! They are always so friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Super expensive and not necessarily Fair Trade!  A dirty chai will set you back about $5 for a 12 oz. mug and their baked goods resemble Costco or some other cheap amalgamation of mass produced croissants.  I used to study here in the winter but I'll take the extra bike ride down to Indie or Barriques."}
{"text":"With Steep & Brew sadly gone, Fair Trade does a nice job filling that void for us. Wide selection of espresso drinks as well as desserts. Be warned the grasshopper mocha is quite sweet. A friendly staff is what sells this place to us. Ample seating but when they are busy getting a table with chairs can be like finding the cheese in a maze. But, remember, this is State Street."}
{"text":"Customer services are really good. Their specials are tasty. I love their chocolate cake so much!"}
{"text":"Four words:  MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE...YUM  Another four words: HOLY CRAP IT\"S LOUD"}
{"text":"Central location on State Street where I met a friend to study. The small, round tables are not ideal for textbooks and laptops, and my iPad's battery continued to dwindle as there are not many outlets to be used. Wouldn't recommend this coffee shop for studying for those reasons, but if you want to read a book or have a conversation it would be nice. We ordered the Chai Charger and it was quite good! (Still a tad pricey)"}
{"text":"Really did not care for this place. The vibe just wasn't there. It might be a good place to stop and get a coffee to-go, but I wouldn't want to hang out inside for any extended period of time. The seating is pretty dull and the staff isn't that friendly. If you're looking for a great atmosphere, go to Michelangelo's; it feels much more \"homey.\"  Pretty sure the only reason people like this place is because it's \"fair trade.\" But so is Michelangelo's, which is way better in every aspect."}
{"text":"I love this place. I visited this place for the first time and got an Expresso Miel & a Chamomile Tea with honey and mint.   The Expresso Miel was SOOOO GOOOOOD.   They had nice service, delicious drinks, and nice ambiance.   I will definitely return.  A+"}
{"text":"Gee whiz are these employees nice. Truly. I spent two back-to-back afternoons at Fair Trade taking meetings and working and I swear everyone was treated like a regular, myself included. One gentleman in particular was chatty and welcoming without being overbearing and just lit up the place.   On my first day I ordered the Californian panini. It was messy (like, crazy messy) but delicious. Pesto, tomatoes, avocado, and melty cheese blended well but the hot pesto and tomato dripped everywhere. There is no dainty way to eat this sandwich. Be sure to have a napkin or two handy and lean over your plate.  Day two I stuck to a hot chocolate made with almond milk and that was quite delicious. My meeting buds seemed to enjoy their drinks as well.   Fair Trade is the sister store to Michelangelo's, so their bakery case also looks incredible. I regret not ordering anything, but I guess that just means I'll have to go back.   My only major complaint is that the internet was majorly dodgy both days. I was trying to upload one single picture and it failed and failed and failed - their internet just couldn't handle it. There were also several times throughout both afternoons that the internet just cut out completely. It's a pleasant atmosphere for hanging out and working, but if the internet is usually that sketchy I think the annoyance would deter me from making it a regular stop."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to catch up or to grab a coffee to study. Staff was really friendly and helpful with questions about the menu. I tried the black bean burger with a side of the chickpea curry soup. Both were really good. The outdoor seating adds an extra touch to the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved it as a college study spot. Fantastic lattes and small bites.  Wifi and good music."}
{"text":"I hate Starbucks!  I hate being  served quickly by courteous employees!  It's all so corporate!  I'd much rather go to Fair Trade Coffee where I can pay a $2 ATM surcharge to eventually get my drink and/or rock-hard scone while I listen to employees complain about one another... I mean, please-- beyond the \"fair trade\" gimmick what distinguishes this place at all from any coffee shop on state street (or any other street in the USA)?  $2 surcharge=unacceptable."}
{"text":"I would be outrageously betraying my undergrad self if I didn't give Fair Trade a freaking fantastic review. I may as well have left my toothbrush and started forwarding my mail there given how many hours I spent hermiting it UP in the back of that place. Thanks for the good grades, FTC!  The tea is the way to go. A strong selection of loose-leaf Fair Trade stuffs (duh). I opted for blackberry enough times that they would try to sell it to me in bulk. Can't you see I'm buying a mug just for the right to park myself here for hours and hours and hours?   The food is okay. Soup can be hit or miss, baked goods are the same. I will stress that this is a place to get a caffeinated beverage of choice and sit with work. Just the right amount of ambient noise and lighting... now get away from my outlet."}
{"text":"Wonderful people, amazing coffee and tea, great prices and fair trade. Very helpful staff. They allowed us to sample each brew before purchasing beans."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go hang out with friends or work when I'm downtown, especially in nice weather when I can enjoy the hanging garden-like back patio.  The drinks are always decent; the baked goods are tasty (with GF and vegan options available regularly); the wifi is reliable and free; the bathrooms are consistently clean, regardless of how busy the cafe is; and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Nice location, nice decor... mediocre coffee.  Maybe it's the barista, maybe it's the machine, maybe it's just bad coffee.   I have it on good authority that the tea is excellent, however."}
{"text":"Uh, ok, type of place. This is a sister-place of Michelangelo coffee house that's on upper State Street. So they have the same coffee, tea, pastry, and cake ... selections. I kind of liked their hot sandwich service. That is, if you prefer, you can ask them to toast their pre-made sandwich on their panini machine. I thought it was nice touch. It sort of makes up for the fact that in this town, you can't get made-to-order sandwich in a coffee shop (I miss SF Bay Area). Bring cash, or you'll have to withdraw money from their ATM machine with $2 fee - and realize that with that $2, you could buy a cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for a midday coffee. It was very busy. One of our drinks was prepared with cow's milk instead of the almond milk requested. They remade the drink, but one of the barristas was overheard saying, 'I know she didn't say almond milk'. (Actually, yes, she did.) Rude. The coffee is Equal Exchange brand, which isn't a favorite, but it's ok. The ordering line and path to add your add-ins is very narrow and crowded, and my coffee was almost knocked out of my hand by someone else making their way through. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here again unless in dire need of caffeine."}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee house I've ever frequented, and I used to frequent this place a lot back in the days when I'd have to hunker down with my 6 novels a week for school.    Tons of tables, lots of menu options, yummy bakery case stuff, ready copies of The Onion, cool, friendly staff, and walls covered in ever-changing artwork for sale by local artists.  These peeps know how to make a skim chai latte like no other."}
{"text":"Got a latte which was pretty good!  Also got a toasted bagel with cream cheese -- it appears they toast their bagels on like a panini press? The end result is a big raw bready bagel with toast lines on it instead of an actually toasted bagel -- not very good"}
{"text":"Fair Trade boasts: A large, open seating area with plenty of outlets along the walls, A kickin' vegan pumpkin chocolate chip muffin, A mean chai charger, And free wifi (which doesn't even require a password).  I don't really know what else you need in a study spot. (:"}
{"text":"For what you can do with coffee in this fair city, Fair Trade is not even fourth runner-up.  The interior lacks character and the staff ranges from somewhat knowledgable about coffee to completely clueless.  During the summer, they keep it nice and cool inside -- a perfect oasis for the air conditioning-less. (2.5 stars if I could)"}
{"text":"Since the sale of Fair Trade Coffee House it has really gone down hill.  This place used to be owned by Michelangelo's Coffee House owner and it was pretty good then, aside from some extremely rude employees.  Now I won't go here for ANYTHING  unless I'm starving to death; in which case I'd get one of their gluten free pumpkin muffins.  ONLY if I was really pressed for time.  You see, I work about 200 feet from this place at the plasma center; we used to come here all the time-4 times a week for awhile but then employees got ruder, coffee got sour and Smokey tasting, and heaven forbid you ask for something specific; because they made my friend feel like she was really putting them out by asking for an extra shot of espresso and soy in her vanilla latte.  She continued to give them her business for a few more weeks but eventually we all got fed up with being treated like an inconvenience instead of a valued customer; have you seen how huge this place is? And it's ALWAYS near empty... get a clue Fair Trade!!!  Until then we are more than happy and willing to walk the five blocks to Michelangelo's Coffee House where we KNOW we'll be treated respectfully and like we are valued.  Besides, the food is incredible at Michelangelo's and their baker?? SLAY!!"}
{"text":"I live and die by caramel flavored coffee drinks. This place completely nails the caramel macchiato. I'm not too adventurous with my coffee, but I'd feel totally comfortable trying something new from Fair Trade.  The environment is calm but busy in the way of the staff constantly cleaning and conjuring, and the customers absorbed in work or a good book. In other words, it's quiet enough to get things done but busy enough to provide entertainment for your daydreaming.  Their pastries are also delightful. I split a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin with a friend, and I wished I hadn't. I wanted it all for myself. It was the perfect balance of moist and dense that you want in a baked good. Two thumbs way the hell up for that muffin.  One last charming detail I noticed in the cafe was the artwork. Large, intriguing paintings usually hang on the wall. I regret not investigating further but my best guess says that they are made by local artists, maybe even students, and available for purchase. You might just have to stop in and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Super high-octane delicious Americano. Awesome spicy Lentil soup. And really nice waitstaff. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"My mom and sisters came for a visit.  My mom wanted coffee, so we stopped into Fair Trade Coffee on State St. Madison, WI.  The coffee was so-so, the smoothies were NOT good, but worst of all was the service.  A girl with blue hair and a girl with brown hair twice were rude to my mom when she asked for a to-go cup two separate times.  The service is terrible and we will NEVER go there again.  Also, everything is expensive and they expect you to give a tip.  It's ridiculous.  Bad service with gross food/drinks at a high cost to me does not equal fair nor does it equal anything worthy of a tip.  Never again."}
{"text":"Usually I don't just avoid \"gluten-free-vegan-friendly\" joints, I run from them, but it was cold and slippery and we needed a place to get some work done without eating so we wouldn't ruin our appetites for Sri Lankan lunch at KJs Curry Bowl.  We also wanted to be downtown, and this cafe was closest to the legal parking spot we miraculously stumbled across on a near zero degree January Madison morning.  Serendipity is always good.  As expected, the baked goods were not tempting, but my cappuccino was properly prepared and the tea bag tea the Chief of Staff ordered was adequate.        We prefer tea served properly boiling hot over loose leaves in a tea pot with a normal sized tea cup and saucer, since we were in an American coffee shop I knew to order coffee.  Like a lot of coffee shops, they serve tea in an oversized coffee mug and saucer which actually makes it a bit of a challenge to drink while you are concentrating on reading.   The cappuccino comes in a cappuccino came in a cappuccino cup. American coffee shop owners must love Italians but hate the British.  Hmm, maybe that's fair.        It's a sunny wide open room, with a smaller warmer room in the back (with a fireplace!), the State Street facing window gives the place a warm feeling even on a frigid day.  Most of the tables are set up for sitting straight and getting some work done, but there's a round low table with an assortment of more comfy chairs, these chairs called my name.  Once in reading position, only then did I consult YELP and was pleased to find that from my comfy chair I was looking out the window right up at the apartment the famous Sarah P. lived in during her undergraduate days (above the Jamba Juice) and I do like historic places.        Scrolling through the YELP reviews, I wondered about the handful of negative reviews, complaining about the service and the sandwich prices.  I'm not sure that the prices complaint is still valid (the worst reviews seem older) as costs here for the food and beverages are completely in line with the location.  I'm an academic, I've had coffee and preposterous conversations all over this town. I think that your opinion of the service might depend on personal taste.  Me, I don't like the fake saccharine insincere friendliness of many corporate chain coffee shops.  I've got a pathetic recently divorced middle-aged overweight heterosexual male friend, an academic who still wears his thinning graying hair long in a sad ponytail to give you a mental picture, he loves Starbucks mainly because some attractive young goth thing will smile at him and act like she's glad to see him.  That sentence was so long that I'm not sure I worked in the key adjective, pathetic. What I prefer about the service here is that the baristas are polite, efficacious and efficient without any ersatz exaggerated friendliness.  That doesn't mean they're rude, one of them pretended to listen to the peculiar rambling of some local crazy man (could be a tenured English lit professor) but there was some sort of unspoken but clearly practiced teamwork strategy so entertaining this colorful fellow didn't slow up counter service. I wonder if he was both crazy and an English professor, I mean how could anyone tell?       Although I'm not a fan of the gluten-free fad, and I find vegan to be distasteful and ethnocentric, I do like the social justice of fair-trade.  The thing is, I'm not sure that in all of the Madison area that there is a coffee shop that doesn't claim to be fair trade.  It is, however, in the name of this place."}
{"text":"When I walked into Fair Trade, a nice comforting feeling overcame my body. The nice smell of coffee filled my nose, and there was no line. The customer service was fabulous and top notch. I ordered an iced coffee to go which came up within 30 seconds of placing the order. My iced coffee was an exceptionally good price, too!   The taste of the coffee is something to mention. For me, most iced coffee has a bitter taste. This iced coffee had an amazing dark chocolate/cocoa after taste that last a little."}
{"text":"It's been hit or miss for me. Right now my fiancé is drinking a fantastic mocha but I am stuck with a watery Turkish latte. :(  In the past, I've had a good experience overall. I like it here more in the winter because summer gets so hot!  I'd like to try their food soon - it sounded yummy. Oh and last thing -- chairs are uncomfortable.   ( Last last thing: I really support the café's mission of serving fair trade!)"}
{"text":"Seriously.... Best coffee I've ever had. Amazing latte, cold brew and nitro! Grab souffle too, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Not sure how there can be any negative reviews for this place. I had no idea what to get, but the barista was incredibly helpful. I took her advice and got the California panini and Purple Mountain Majesty iced tea--couldn't be more satisfied. Out of all the cafes on State this has to be my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite cafe in Madison! They have great vegan peanut butter bars!!  The staff is great and I love the vibe in this cafe.  I regularly stop in for a cup of nitro brew and a vegan zucchini muffin!"}
{"text":"Love the way it's run relaxed perfect for study ,reading or just enjoying the window in state st,I love to find unconventional treats and teas,art is another thing I like to check too"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today for a meeting and afterwards I ordered the Californian sandwich to-go. I didn't get a chance to eat it until almost 30 minutes later and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was still warm! I think this was due to the fact that they wrapped it in aluminum foil and sealed in all the warm, toasty goodness. This was very much appreciated.  The sandwich itself was excellent. It was a flatbread panini with avocado, tomato, cheese and pesto. It was incredibly tasty, but I am going to call it a \"two-handed\" sandwich. I attempted to catch up on some personal tasks and messages during lunch but soon had to forgo the multitasking to tend to the pesto running down my arm. I'm not saying this in a bad way - the melty cheese definitely helped hold most of it together - I'm just saying have some napkins handy.  In addition to the good food, they offered good customer service and were helpful in answering my questions about allergens. They also had a good list of smoothies on their menu so I will definitely be back to try some of those!"}
{"text":"Ah good vibes all around.   They whip up my ideal chai. Strong chai flavor that doesn't need any fluff of sweeteners or cream to make it delicious. It makes me happy that they don't frown in confusion when I explain I just want the tea, not the latte. No sugar, just some iced chai tea goodness. They brew it up real strong and remind me that when my cup runs dry, they've got some ready and free refills. Perfect.   The gluten free pumpkin chocolate chip muffin at Fair Trade is where it's really at. This guy is how I define the perfect muffin. I like gluten, but man this dude doesn't need it. The lack of gluten makes for an incredibly chewy texture so unique that I'm left in awe and craving more. The chocolate chips and pumpkin flavor only add to the happiness.   Friends rave to me about the zucchini muffin and I finally tried it today over my usual pumpkin muffin love. While I personally favor the pumpkin chocolate chip, there's no denying this is one tasty muffin. When something is covered in a cinnamon-oat streusel topping, it's hard not to be amazing. Think banana bread, in a portable muffin shape. And this muffin is huge, so double thumbs up.   Oh but I can't forget the brownies. They are similarly ginormous like the muffins, studded with copious amounts of chocolate chips, and oh so rich. If you like dense, flavor packed brownies, then this is your brownie. Best in town in my book.  In sum, the drinks are on point, the service is smashing, and the sugary concoctions make me swoon. Check it."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their chicken chipotle sandwich! It just serves my tastebud right. I love their black-forest mocha, but don't really like the almond mocha. Oooh, they have a delectable biscotti too! Worth buying.  This is also my place to study if I am bored with my apartment and libraries."}
