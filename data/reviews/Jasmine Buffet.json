{"text":"It's our first time at Jasmine Buffet. The size of the restaurant and food selection took us by surprise. When you first walk in, there is a beautiful fountain. 

The food selection was from traditional Chinese buffet items to bbq ribs and chicken to pizza and chicken strips. Something for everyone!  But the best is the hibachi grill. Choose you mix of vegetables, rice, noodles, chicken, steak, beef, crab, shrimp and more...all cooked to order!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE what they've done to the place.. Pretty impressive! Excellent customer service and good food. The variety is great."}
{"text":"Okay when it comes to Chinese buffets.  There is quite a variety and even a pretty good sushi bar.  My main problem was that the food was waaaaay too salty, so much so that after dining there Mother Day, my feet and hands were still quite swollen two days later, and I drank tons of water to clear all that MSG from my body.  So while the food was okay, the sushi not bad and the fruit bar quite nice, I can't weather all that sodium which disappoints since it's in my Steele Creek neighborhood.  Other folks might enjoy it, especially families."}
{"text":"All I can say is, this place hit the spot! Chinese food craving quenched.
Great beef/chicken and broccoli, Sesame chicken and fish."}
{"text":"I expected so much more from this place after reading these reviews. The place looks very nice on the inside and the buffets were HUGE, so we were really excited. I literally took one bite of everything before moving on to the next item on my plate. The rice was hard and dry as if it was cooked yesterday, the vegetables were mush, and every single piece of food on my plate (straight from the buffet!) was cold. The sushi looked just as unappetizing as it was. I will definitely NEVER return to Jasmine Buffet."}
{"text":"I was instantly impressed when I walked through the doors and saw that the place wasn't as shady as it seems on the outside.  It is large and spacious.   And even still, we went on a Saturday afternoon, and saw it get very busy (but there was still more than enough space).  It seemed pretty clean, decent price.  However, the quality of the food is so underwhelming that the sheer quantity of the food did not improve my experience.   The chicken was greasier than normal, and the flavor just wasn't there - it was like something was missing from all of the dishes we tried (and we tried just about everything!)  The sushi was ok... wasn't a 5 star but it seemed decently put together, and more enjoyable for me than the regular food (altbough in all honesty, I can eat sushi just about anywhere and be fine).  They had a typical dessert bar with ice cream (that all the kids present insisted that theyd get to scoop! Lol).  So, all in all, nothing too fancy.  If the taste was better they would have received more stars from me."}
{"text":"We had a group of 13 people that ate here last night. The server comes over and brings us our drinks and never returns to clear plates, fill drinks or even ask if everything was ok. While we were eating the server magically appears and hands us a bill! When we finished eating we made sure to leave a 20% gratuity tip. The server was obviously not happy with this and decided to share her frustration with another employee while pointing to us and yelling loudly! She must not know the standard for a large party is 18% gratuity! Besides the food just being OK, nothing to brag about, the service was horrible! I will never return to this location again!"}
{"text":"Huge all you can eat restaurant.  I have gone there many times.  Love the food. Like the grill where you can order your own stir-fry.  good selection of sushi.  very affordable price."}
{"text":"Too much $$ for the quality and lack of variety.  The best part was the server asking us to not forget to tip him.  Real classy.  The exterior and entrance make it appear better than what is offered.  Regular Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and found Jasmine Buffet through yelp. Good selection, friendly staff, and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found a lot of varieties in non-vegetarian items. Especially the Hibachi Grill corner was very good. All the fried items had a weird taste, guess chicken , seafood were all fried in the same oil"}
{"text":"Very happy to see another Chinese buffet in the area. And this one has more parking and easier street access than Dragon, so it will be a better lunch choice when time is limited.

The food is very good, standard Chinese buffet, plus sushi bar and hibachi grill. The buffet has many American comfort foods as well; fried chicken, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, and even pizza, so even my non-adventurous family members are happy. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. Somethings (like the Salmon and rice) were fresh and very tasty. Somethings was just not made to my liking, don't mean others won't enjoy those things. I really enjoyed this location, hence the 4 stars. What stood out the most was the cleanliness of this place. It was cleaner than a lot of dine in restaurants and this is a buffet. They have a hibachi and sushi set up where they make everything in front of you by request. If your ever in the Charlotte are and don't know what you want to eat, this,would be a good place to hit up.

Oh the service was cool too. I mean it's a buffet yall. They were on point though"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Nothing special. Food did not taste so good. Dessert selection was poor. Server not able to talk English much. My kids were not impressed as well. Not sure if I'm going again."}
{"text":"A couple months back, I took a co-worker to Jasmine Buffet and he knew one of the Asian females at the register. I was just gonna wait around until I decided to go look at the sushi. As I walked away, I heard some laughing but didn't think anything of it. When we left, my co-worker stated the female stated \"I bet he makes his way to the watermelon!\" As an educated, professional black male, I found this offensive and degrading.  I have tried to hold it, but every time I see the co-worker...it makes me angry he thought it was funny and condoned the comment. I am at a point now, where I wonder what other comments or actions are being taken against folks her! The staff here needs some cultural diversity, because I guess she forgot she is a minority too!"}
{"text":"Food is not as good as it was when the opened. They don't have as many vegetables on the buffet as they use to either."}
{"text":"I tired this tonight and it was just okay. There was a lot of food choices to choose from. The sesame chicken wasn't good at all and that's my favorite thing to get at a Chinese place. Everything was kinda cold and tasted like it has been sitting awhile. All and all it was okay. I would give them another try. Just work on that sesame chicken!!"}
{"text":"Let me start saying that in the past six or seven years I haven't been a great fan of buffets. My brother and his family convinced me to go here because it's similarities with the huge and nice Las Vegas buffets. All I have to say is WOW!! This place was wonderful. Unbelievable selections and the variety seemed limitless. Every time I got up I filled up a new plate with all new and delicious food. The staff was very very friendly. I will
Definitely be back. I highly recommend this place. Almost forgot the crabs were to die for."}
{"text":"6-28 Visit update. Some changes noticed. No more breakfast. No more prepay. And now a kid on his cell at the HIBACHI area leaves a lot to be desired. The hot food tables have the save food. Dessert is the same too. Table service was fast and pleasant. Still the best Chinese in south west Charlotte. A"}
{"text":"The food was either too greasy or too dry. Don't understand why there was such a hype about it. Over priced for bad Chinese food. The silverware was also very dirty."}
{"text":"This Chinese Buffet doesn't really stick out from the other Chinese buffets. It's clean, has good service and the food is decent, but there's nothing really special about it. Like the fish were pretty fresh and some weren't as much... but the food is more than edible or tasty. And the atmosphere is good also."}
{"text":"Buffet has many options but lacks flavor from the many items I tried.  I found the lo mien was flavorful and the fresh fruit ripe. I was disappointed with the many standard items like egg roll, fried rice, hibachi made to order.  I also felt that staff should be more present around the buffet and cleaning up the mess left behind from the customers."}
{"text":"The hibachi was great however I wouldn't eat there on a regular basis plus I don't like the part that you have to pay before you eat"}
{"text":"So we decided to try it out as a new lunch spot. I'm not usually much of a fan of buffets, but decided to try anyway. I'm glad I did! They had a wide variety of food, including a sushi bar and hibachi grill. The sushi bar had about 6 different types of rolls(may have more at dinner) and I always like a make your own hibachi. I wish there would've been more protein options on the hibachi bar, but that's the only negative I have. Add in the fact that it's under $9, and it's a great option for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever had to pay for my food AND tip my server before I've even been seated. The food quality, selection & service is not superior to any other buffet I've ever been to... It is just average and basic. So the price of $10.99 is the only redeeming factor here! but honestly I would much rather go to Amber buffet in Rock Hill on Tuesday when their special price is also $10.99 and the food has flavor and I don't have to PAY before I eat. or even Tin Tin in pineville which has CRAB legs and authentic soups. and if its the sushi you're excited about, just go to Ru San's for the all you can eat sushi lunch buffet for $11.99!"}
{"text":"Great buffet including asian favorites as well as classic american fare. There is a hibachi station and a sushi station. There is a nice dessert selection including scoop your own ice cream. Make sure to grab your own fork at the buffet."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I wanted a buffet close to my house that I could binge eat at whenever the craving arose but it was just meh. 

The table we sat at was sticky and kind of gross so that started off the whole experience in a mediocre manner. 

Their food prompted the same meh reaction as well and some of their sushi didn't look fresh. The pieces that I did get weren't that great so I moved on to the other dishes at the buffet. I tried the usual stuff, some fried items, stir fried dishes, a few seafood items; all of which were sub par at best. Some food seemed like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for too long. My fiance had gotten some stuff he couldn't even finish because he thought it was so bad. 

Unfortunately, I won't be back here and will continue my search for a place where I can shamelessly enjoy 3 plates of food when I go on a food bender."}
{"text":"This place makes the whole family happy.  Sushi, Hibachi, Chinese food, seafood, and assortment of other food plus ice cream to finish.  Yes you can probably get better but not at a buffet priced like this.  I would recommend it especially if you have big appetites to satisfy.  Also, service was great drinks were filled promptly and plates were cleared almost immediately."}
{"text":"There are quite a few large buffets in the area, one being Passion Grill in Gastonia and another is China King Super Buffet on Tyvola, and this one is right up there with them. I would say as far as size and variety go, It's 2nd to Passion but beats China King. 

They have a separate sushi bar and a hibachi grill to go along with the standard buffet items. The dessert, fruit, salad areas are also heavy with options compared to your typical buffet. There is plenty of room to aimlessly roam around looking at the options and due to the size, I've hardly ever had to wait for people to get out of my way, which would suck if you're really hungry. When hungry and confronted with more food than one could ever hope to eat, I often contemplate the morality of pushing little kids out of the way when they are clumsily trying to tong noodles onto their plates. Luckily, I don't have worry about it here. 
They have the hard-to-find beef with broccoli (for my dad) as well as the common chicken with broccoli. They have various white fish and grilled salmon (grilled in a white sauce). They have a spinach with cheese dish that I've never seen. It's really good.  There is obviously much more, including two different types of rice. There are a few \"American\" dishes such as pizza  and some kind of meat as well as other stuff I haven't paid a lot of attention to. 

The food itself is actually tasty. It's not something to blow you away but they keep it full and fresh and depending on your personal tastes, it's rather good, especially now compared to when they first opened. I thought everything was overcooked when they first opened, however, as time has gone by for them to settle, I have been here many times and it's definitely much better. 

The staff is moderately friendly (quiet but nice) and are efficient. They always have someone taking your empty plate or filling your drink without much wait and you can tell they are constantly scanning the GIGANTIC dining area to make sure we're all happy. 

The price, in my opinion, is just about right. It's around the same as China King but offers much more. It's a few dollars less expensive than Passion Grill, but offers a little less. 

With all this positive, why not five stars instead of four? Well, I suppose it's simply because the food taste isn't the most impressive. As I mentioned, there are good dishes, and it's not at all bad, but nothing to get excited about. I would say it was normal with some hits and some misses, but hey, it's all subjective anyway. 

Since I'm a fan and this place is near me, it will be a go-to place to eat for those days when I don't feel like spending too much energy on figuring out what \"I'm in the mood for\" or when not feeling up to figuring out a new place to try. 

One tip... remember to grab your silverware at the buffet tables with your plate or you'll have to get up again. I don't know how many times this has happened to me and my company."}
{"text":"This is a nice buffet. The food is good and the place is clean. There are a good amount of choices, but it seemed like there were more American foods than anything else. There's a good fruit selection and desert selection with ice cream. Service could be better, i didnt see anyone throughout the whole meal. My drink wasnt refilled at all, and we sat waiting awhile for the check. This place is good, but i still like Tokyo Grill better for taste, slection, and price. I paid 23.79 for 2 people on Sunday and that didnt include drinks since they were free with the yelp check in."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years and the food is always fresh and the restaurant is clean.  Friendly staff and plenty of choices for all tastes.  For a buffet one of the best I have been to."}
{"text":"Jasmine has a little something for everyone at a good price.  The hibachi grille is my favorite, where I can choose my own raw ingredients to be cooked on the spot.  The sushi bar isn't bad.  The buffet is quite large and is better than average.  Service is good and very efficient."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and since we were on the South side popped in. Everything was grest. I actually enjoyed whatever I chose to put in my plate. The food didn't look like it was left over anywhere. I don't eat alot but we put a dent in that bar. My Lil one even found another 2 yr old munching away. Lovely staff.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place was packed on Mother's Day! Service and food quality was good. Ambience, people and various food choices all together makes it outstanding. Also good for weekday lunch. I give 4 stars and give time to be the best in future."}
{"text":"This is our go to buffet. If I work on Sunday and no one cooks in my house (often ) we end up here. There is always plenty of fresh food. We are always seated right away. The staff is friendly. Plenty of sushi !!!!

The only thing I don't love is the small children who run around playing. Which isn't the restaurants fault."}
{"text":"Tried this place last week and loved it. They have lots of food to choose from along with a hibachi grill where you select ingredients to be cooked fresh. The food I got from the buffet was fresh and very tasty. This is in my neighborhood so I'm sure I will be visiting regularly."}
{"text":"I went once and would not return. The basic dishes (sesame, general tso, beef broccoli. ...) were not good. They all tasted bland or off. I only enjoyed the crab and that took forever to refill the trays...clearly because everyone liked the crab! Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Very nice place and very nice to finally have a great Chinese buffet on the Southside of town. Great food selection, awesome sushi and hibachi grill. I only had 2 gripes about Jasmines. The first one was that I really don't care for picking up silverware with the rest of the buffet items. (Just my pet peeve) But the other was that our waitress literally abandoned us after we were sat down LITERALLY!!! And the other waiter and waitresses didn't not know if we were being helped or not. I will try to come back and use my discount for the free beverage I got for checking in. Lol"}
{"text":"I live close to Jasmine Buffet so I convinced my friend to try it. Going to try a new place when you're really hungry probably isn't the best idea, but we're adventurous.  The place looked great and we were seated quickly. And that's about all the positive I have- the food had the same texture  (NOT good), flavors were NOT tasty and I will not be returning. Even the hibachi food was overcooked because the food was rushed. There were a couple of inedible bites from the buffet that just made me want to run. I can just as easily spend more money for great Chinese/Asian food instead of throwing away food and money. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Found out about this buffet here on Yelp. Read a lot of really good reviews so we came to see for ourselves.  Had no idea from the outside that this delicious restaurant was in here. The windows are dark and hide all the yummy food from view.... But I highly recommend you go inside . It was fabulous. Lots of different foods - including a really fresh sushi bar. There is many types of Chinese foods as well as a lot of salads and desserts.  Don't miss this place on your eating out list . You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed at their lunch buffet the food was luke warm to cold the flavors were only fair. The best part of the buffet for me was the hibachi grill. Maybe their dinner buffet would  be better but I know better buffets in Charlotte I probably will not be going back"}
{"text":"Buffet standards, it's eh. The place is very large, simple and it has a decent amount of choices. Watch out for some super salty items, they are just inedible. As for sushi, it has a bit more to choose from than others but it's quality is average. Service is rushed at times such as finishing one plate of food and then seeing my check already. Still, it's value works with the cheap price."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks nice on the inside and clean. However the food is the is the absolute worst. My husband and I are sick. We just left there."}
{"text":"I went the first week it opened and it was bad. The food was overcooked and just plain bad tasting. I didn't try the hibachi but if the rest of the food is any indicator I don't want to. There seems to be a huge trend in buffets to cram as much crap as possible into the menu whether it is good or not. The sushi was a joke like most of these places and they didn't even have any crab ragoon a staple of all Chinese food places. No need to ever go back."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet I thought it was pretty good! There is a variety of food & none of it seems sketchy. Friendly. The sushi wasn't bad. The hibachi grill was decent. Looking for quick & a lot it's a good place to go!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time tonight for dinner at 8:30pm. I'm giving them 2 stars because the 1st star is for selection. They have a huuuggee selection of food. The 2nd star is for service. They were really fast with cleaning up plates. Unfortunately I can't give any stars for food quality. Everything tasted like it had been sitting a while and there were very few things I cared for. And I love Chinese food! Maybe coming at a busier time would be better, but we will probably not be going back."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice. While they are pricey compared to Draggon Buffet which is rich down the street, the variety here exceeds way beyond what dragon buffet has to offer. It's a nice spot to grab a bite to eat but definitely not someplace I can go to weekly. The fried chicken and their buffalo wings could use some work but with so many options I am more then happy to find something else enjoyable to eat."}
{"text":"For south Charlotte I would say this was well needed for the area. A good decent buffet with a big section of food. Not overly price and seafood selection was very decent, somethings it's a little heavy on the sauce but hell if your at the buffet line in pretty sure u don't give a damn about your health or WIEGHT so sauce it up bitches and give me seconds bc i can over indulge and get wheel barreled up out of that mofo hahahaha"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a 3.5 stars. It was above average, but not up to 4. There was a huge variety, primarily Chinese food, however they had other food including chicken tenders, fries, pizza and pasta. There were about 10 different stations, a build your own hibachi grill, salad bar and sushi.  

The sushi was ok. I wouldn't recommend it. The hibachi was pretty good. You build you own from a selection of veggies, meat and seafood. Most of the food was fresh and nothing tasted as it sat out for hours. They also have a dessert bar with various treats and 8 different ice creams. 

Overall for $10.99 ( at dinner) it's a great deal, however this was a one time is enough for me. If buffets are your thing I would recommend jasmines due to the variety of choices."}
{"text":"Cold food on the buffet and this is a place to go
if you want seafood not Chinese food.   Horrible we left our food on plates after a couple of bits of everything being cold.   Suck will never go back!    Off to Dragon Buffet to get better Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We went here looking for a good Chinese buffet and found instead a pile of tables with over cooked under season indistinguishable food. Even the desserts were bad. They were like you took Philo bread sprinkle sugar on it and cooked it no effort at all was made to make something that tastes good."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and good ! The workers are nice and do a great job of keeping the place clean . Only thing I wish is that they have more food to choose from ."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and was super excited even before they opened. We have eaten there a few times just to make sure they weren't having an off night and Im just not a fan.They have been out of things every time I've been. I would suggest Dragon, fewer options but better quality.You won't die or anything but Its just okay."}
{"text":"Wow, so much bad food. I would rather them have half the options and twice the quality. I went with a buddy for lunch, it became a game of \"who can find something that tastes good\" - I think we each found 1 or 2 things tolerable - nothing good. I would avoid this place unless you don't mind bad tasting food."}
{"text":"It's a great location, great prices, plenty of options including a great Sushie bar & the salad bar actually has real salad and not the chopped up lettuce heads like other buffets. Excellent choice! Never again going to Dragan buffet, they need to step up their game or they're going to go out of business."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new Chinese buffet, so I waited a while before venturing inside, as I kinda picky about buffets, but Jasmine did not disappoint. They, for a Chinese buffet rate significantly higher that most, and for the SW region of Charlotte, higher that Dragon Buffet, in that they have more than double the selection of everything, especially chicken wings, to which I a BIG fan. The food display is well maintained and bakery area is a delight to the eyes. I'm not a sushi fan, so I wont comment on that part.  All in all, worthy of a return visit, reasonably prices at $8.49 for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Jasmine Buffet. You have to go with reasonable expectations though. There is always a lot of selection and most of the selections are fresh and tasty. They have a lot of seafood choices at night and on the weekends but I'm not a fan of seafood. The sushi selection is nothing to rave about but it's there. I've never had a problem with service or the food."}
{"text":"The only Buffet my wife will eat at its clean and has  alots of choices of food and they don't let  the kids play in the food they monitor it very well"}
{"text":"This is the best value for price of a buffet I have ever seen. It was about $9 and there were six or eight of those buffet tables with food, a hibachi grill, and a sushi bar. The variety in food is ridiculous. There were several tables for asian style food, one table for american style food, one table for fried foods, a raw bar of oysters and mussles, a salad bar, a pudding bar, an ice cream bar, and a dessert bar. 

I was pleasantly suprised by the amount of fish offered, the salmon and whitefish were quite good. There were however very few fully vegetarian dishes, I think the only thing they had was a green beans dish. The hibachi looked very popular but I did not try it. The sushi bar was pretty sad and I didn't really trust the fish. I definitely did not trust the raw bar, the oysters looked very slimy. 

The desserts were ok, the ice cream was pretty good.

Overall the food is not the best, I would say subpar to your regular old chinese takeout, but for the price and the variety this is definitely a very good deal and there's plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This buffet is several grades higher than Normal Americanized Chinese food. You can tell that the chefs have real skill.
They have a lavish set of offerings like sushi and a Hibachi Grill. They have chilled shrimp and mussels as well as a nice salad bar with octopus salad and an extensive array of desserts as well as ice cream.
Lunch is $8.49 and dinner is $10.99
I didn't give them 5 stars because they use the wrong rice and don't use vinegar on the sushi"}
{"text":"It's a new place so hopefully it gets better for all the space there really is not that much Asian food. Limited sushi and really more American cuisine than anything else hope they get more creative. Good for a quick local lunch"}
{"text":"Really yummy food. Was impressive. Desserts were way better then any buffet I have been to this far. Like it and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice Chinese buffet overall. The sushi was okay (nigiri was overstuff, I'd avoid, but their rolls were pretty good- expect something along the lines of good grocery store sushi- not amazing, but completely acceptable). I ventured to also eat some raw oysters, which seemed pretty fresh, but I'd still be cautious since they are pre shucked. 

Everything else was okay and standard, but the black pepper chicken was amazing imo. The rest of my party complained about the hibachi grill being horrible, but I stuck to my seafood. 

Can't say I'm in love with the place and can't say it's great quality, but not a bad deal for $12 (holiday price)."}
{"text":"Clean, good service, tons of choices, sushi was good and fresh, Chinese stuff good....3 people for dinner, 2 drinks was $40"}
{"text":"Above average Chinese buffet.  Selection is good, and they do have a sushi bar and hibachi bar.  But neither one is up to snuff with what you would get at a dedicated restaurant (i.e. sushi restaurant, or hibachi restaurant). But that is to be expected at these prices.

I'd say the average Chinese buffet, to me, is a 2.  I give this one a 3 because it's pretty nice."}
{"text":"Very tasteful! Personally, the best Chinese buffet in South Charlotte. You don't get crab legs but there are fried blue crabs that are amazing! And the crawfish is good too"}
{"text":"Food is just ok, my favorite was the hibachi grill, you could pick and choose was want to grill. Lot of fried selections if you're watching your weight stick to hibachi at least. The selection were too over cooked and greasy like the fried shrimp, salmon and ribs. Didn't really have my favorite chooses of sushi but they did have that yummy pink shrimp sauce. I did try the hot wings and grilled chicken both were great. Nice and clean but of course new in the area. Not that excited been to way better Chinese restaurants than this. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Jasmine Buffet when I was running an errand nearby. I was not disappointed at Jasmine Buffet. I feel they have better quality and tastier food than other Chinese buffets. This buffet just opened five months ago. They do have hibachi grill and sushi bar. I love the hibachi grill. The price is about 8.59. I didn't get a chance to taste its sushi but my dad said it was pretty good. If you happen to be near there please give them a try. They do have plenty of parking lot and easy to park there."}
{"text":"Look out Dragon!!!! The food and selection is MUCH BETTER and they don't have a SHITTY ATTITUDE like YALL do!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to write about this place - the price alone is worth it! the sushi and the hibachi grill is the best things there worth going, the buffet selections are just okay.  I think of it this way where can you get all you can eat sushi for around 9 lunch and 11 for dinner. Plus fruit, desserts and ice cream.  Like I said go for the price, keep coming back for the all you can eat sushi.(The sushi temp is always cold)"}
{"text":"Don't recommend. Lots of selection but the food taste likes it's been there for days. A nasty smell as soon as you enter. We ordered water and even that tasted and smelled bad. Amber Buffet in Rock Hill is much better. Even more selection and food is very fresh. Their establishment is also very clean. This one wasn't. I'm picky with Buffet and this is why."}
{"text":"Not bad at at all. Various items to choose from. Good selection of seafood. Would you spend $10.99 to get unlimited fish fry?? I certainly would. I would also mention that the fish was really good. Didn't eat too much of the other items but the shrimp and fish was well worth it to me."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. First refill on beverage, the waiter put the glass on a dirty plate.  Returned to the table with the same dirty glass with food particles on the glass. Proceeded to slide it across the table.  Dine at your own risk.  Management was not willing to do more than \" I will talk to him.\""}
{"text":"The best asian buffet I've found in town yet. Beef roll and grilled steak is awesome. Nice price for lunch. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food for a buffet!! 
Typical service level from a Chinese place, but no major complaints"}
{"text":"Short version: 
Took longer to be seated than expected. 
Sushi is fair, too much filler ruins the flavor
Seaweed cup is too sweet 
Variety of Asian flavors seems limited (disappointed)
Lots of American food (didn't try)
Fruit is really good 
Service is quick about clearing old plates and keeping drinks topped off."}
{"text":"I am not a complainer but this was possibly one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had. All of the food was balms and tasted just a little off. The hibachi shrimp wasn't grilled completely and the white sauce tasted like miracle whip with a bitter after taste. 
We tasted a bite of everything and told management that we didn't want it. he only charged us for kids meals but still I spent $18 for a taste of nasty food then still had to go home and cook dinner."}
{"text":"This food is not meant for human consumption. Coworkers wanted to go and I tagged along. There was actually a \"sushi\" roll with tuna salad in it. It's like an Asian PB&J?"}
{"text":"What a smorgasbord!  The place has it all - Chinese buffet, sushi, made to order hibachi, even roast beef! 

The best part about this establishment is the made to odder hibachi. They have several veggie and meat options to build your own stir fry, four sauces, and they cook it in front of you. The shrimp on mine were cooked perfectly and the chef added the right amount of chili flakes to give the dish a nice spice level. 

The sushi bar had a surprising amount of choice and complexity. They went above the standard tuna, salmon and California rolls to include rainbow rolls, several fried rolls, and my favorite which was spicy tuna topped with tuna. 

The Chinese buffet was pretty good as well. I loved the seafood alfredo dish they had as well as the chicken and broccoli. The food was a little greasy but that is par for the course at this type of buffet. The soups were okay with the hot and sour being much better than the wonton. 
They have an American section that has nuggets and pizza which I didn't sample. I did try the roast beef which was good but not great. 

I also liked that you pay before you eat, and all the prices are clearly listed. Everything was upfront and had a reasonably priced $12 dinner buffet price. I will definitely return to try out more of their selection."}
{"text":"Jasmine Buffet was pretty good.  Decent selection and prices were comparable to similar buffets in the area.  The restaurant was clean and service was friendly. I have a local favorite buffet that Jasmine didn't quite hold a candle to. However, Jasmine was still above average compared to most other buffets in the local area.  I was trying to decide between 3 or 4 stars, but I had to go with 3 since they didn't have a few of my favorite dishes that I can find at other Chinese buffets."}
{"text":"The first time I went here the good was pretty good, good enough for us to want to go again a week or so later. There wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. The second time, however, there wasn't anything there that I did like. It was like we ate at a totally different restaurant. The soup smelled too bad for me to even want to taste it, the sushi was so nasty I had to literally spit it out into my napkin, the fried shrimp tasted good but halfway through my second piece I realized they didn't bother cleaning the shrimp & left the digestive tract in the shrimp- gross! The only thing that was consistent between my two visits was the fact that the host tried to tell us we didn't a high chair for my 10 month old, suggesting we just keep him in his baby carrier and put him in the seat- what?! It was the same nonsense both times, annoying to say the least. We're about an hour removed from eating there & both my husband and I are sipping ginger ale trying to get rid of our upset stomachs. All in all, we won't be back nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was great when they first opened  but they have greatly declined in the last year. The food is cooked in what tastes like old oil and everything tastes the same. Spices and salt and butter is barely used resulting in a meal that's oily and bland. The sushi was dry and tasteless. The rice fell apart before you could even eat it. I think they've tried way to hard to cut corners but have only lost customers."}
{"text":"Extremely clean and well designed. Prices are reasonable and food is actually good. We were in town visiting and kids wanted a buffet. We chose this one and it was worth it."}
{"text":"My experience at the buffet has been good. They have a large selection of food but the quality is typical chinese buffet nothing too amazing but it has way more selection than Dragon Buffet which is the closest competition. The price is a little high but it is the best Chinese Buffet in the southside Charlotte Area I have had so I don't mind too much but I wouldn't eat here often because of the price."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and was not overly impressed to say the least. The sushi was terrible, the \"prime rib\" was overlooked and dry and the fried oysters tasted fishy and dry. Service wasn't very good either. If sushi is your thing, stay clear. If you like fat, greasy noodles and fried crap sitting under heat lamps then this is your place. It was clean and newly renovated on the positive side."}
{"text":"Great variety. Good food. Ignore some of the bad reviews...it's an inexpensive buffet, just don't go there expecting a 5 star dining experience. Try the hibachi first, I missed it and was too full to try it. My hubby did and he loved it.  We will definitely dine there again."}
{"text":"It was not good at all. The rice was hard..the food had no flavor. The fruit was not fresh it had been sitting out too long. They don't have a lunch special on Sundays and they are over priced. However the sushi was ok. We won't be back. Totally a waste of money."}
{"text":"This buffet is slightly more expensive than other buffets in the area, but it's also got a lot of variety. There's a hibachi grill, a sushi bar, a variety of western and Chinese dishes. Food is decent. It's a buffet, you're not going to get fine dining here. Their fried chicken is delicious. They also have oysters and cocktail shrimp during lunch. You end up paying about $9 a head but it's worth the money."}
{"text":"Very very good food. Lots of variety and great options for kids too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Really nice place for buffet and large selection if food! 
You will be full before trying all dishes even once! Visit this place if ur not counting calories :)"}
{"text":"I just got coupons to this place in the mail. I went with a friend and we were impressed with how large it is. The hostess was kind and showed us to our booth. The Sushi is spot on. I think this place will be my new go to place for Sushi and Asian food. If you have kids who do not like Asian food, they have pizza, French fries and chicken too. I would highly recommend to anybody. Don't let the negative reviews sway your opinion. It is the best out there."}
{"text":"Delicious food with lots of options to choose from.  Several cold bars.  Several hot bars.  Sushi.  It's all here.  Don't let the older sopping center deter you, the inside has been completely remodeled and is in great condition.  I stop by occasionally and pick up a to go box. I can grab a protein and some veg for a really good price.  Charged by the weight of course.

I will say, the multiple prices for to go boxes based on the type of protein is a bit off-putting.  Its like a game of whack a mole.  You see a food item you like, then you see the little plackard that denotes it is a premium item and is going to make your price go up.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Just your average buffet. If you've ever been to one, you've been to this one. Food is okay. Favorite part is the jello. Sushi is good too! And very reasonable priced for an All you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"It's a $9 (lunch) Chinese buffet, that doesn't have a lot of Chinese food on it. There were 4 Asian dishes: Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef w/ Broccoli, Chicken w/ Broccoli, Sesame Chicken, and hibachi chicken. Everything else was American food. 
There were big chunks of tendon in the beef w/ broccoli, there was too much oil on the green beans, etc. 
I don't know why they couldn't just put a decent Chinese menu on the buffer. Needed an orange chicken, a scallion Chicken, beef w/ string beans, sweet & sour pork, etc. 
I like buffets, I didn't like this one."}
{"text":"It's ok. There's not a lot of variety, but it's cheap. I kind of found it weird that we weren't provided silverware but it wasn't the first occurrence of something like that. 

Yeah, I don't have much to say because it's okay but it's not gross. The variety they had wasn't diverse but there was enough to make it decent. 

So... I guess it's okay."}
{"text":"The food was awful!  Too much fried foods and not much vegetables.  No variety... Taste like any other bad Chinese buffet.  Not going back again."}
{"text":"This buffet is close to home for us, and we really enjoyed it. The best part was the wide selection of buffet options--from seafood, to sushi, to hibachi. Some of the food didn't always look fresh, but that's no different than I've seen at any other buffet as the food sits out. 

Their seafood selection includes mussels, crab, lobster, octopus etc. They have a substantial salad bar. I love their sushi selection which includes tempura, nagiri, and Rainbow Rolls. 

For me, this is one of the most affordable buffets around with the highest quality. They also usually have coupons. The restaurant is also HUGE, so you never have to worry about waiting for a seat. 

We will definitely go back when we're looking for our fill of Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice and big on the inside. They have a pretty wide variety of food. I really like their hibachi chicken next to the fried rice. Their sushi was ok. They should probably get some sushi ideas from China buffet or just be creative with it instead of sticking to the usual like other places. They have French fries which was a bit stale when I ate it so they might want to make less and try to make it fresh when there's no more. The service and ambience has been pretty good. Hopefully they keep it up and not go downhill with the service and food"}
{"text":"Returning to Jasmine after a while and I feel the need to drop them to A-OK after today's experience.

The interior is unchanged. The restaurant is clean and the tables are well-managed by the wait staff who quickly refill drinks and clear dirty plates. The steam tables are unchanged. The kitchen staff keep them clean and stocked, clearing off the stuff that people didn't quite manage to get onto their plates. An item dropped on the floor was cleaned up swiftly.

But the food itself seems to be lacking. There's a lot more western food here including mac & cheese, chicken tenders and pizza and stuff for the kids, and there's a lot less Chinese. Really only six or so dishes with a protein in them and two were \"& broccoli.\" Too much fried and too many heavy sauces.

The sushi is fresh and updated, but it wasn't the right kind of rice. The texture of the nigiri was too tight, too dry and unflavored.

The hit here is probably still the hibachi grill but that's not my thing."}
{"text":"The waitresses were really rude and barely refilled our drinks. I ate with a couple friends and one of them didn't eat, they just had a water but the waitresses felt the need to keep staring us and it made us really uncomfortable. The food wasn't anything too special so you could say we are never coming back again."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The food is substandard and the service is horrible then they expect a damn tip. Its a buffet, watch out if they include the gratuity on the bill! The restroom wreaks with urine all over. This was my last time in this establishment."}
{"text":"Above & beyond what I was expecting!

There are sooooo many choices and options of food-styles-cuisines! They have pretty much everything imaginable - from sushi made in front of you to chinese low-main to pizza & chicken fingers. They have salads and dessert buffet bars - literally EVERYTHING. & the lunch special is super cheap too!

Best tip about this place: It's ginormous, so there is never a wait!"}
{"text":"All Chinese buffets have one thing in common- there are some things that are good, and some things that are not so good. The same goes for Jasmine Buffet. 

The decor and atmosphere is not spectacular- the room is arranged to maximize diner efficiency. The food is arranged by categories on about 8-10 islands, each displaying anywhere from 8-16 dishes. The dining area surrounds this central food area. Diners enter the food area, select their choices, then return to their table to eat. Since it is all you can eat, you can go back as many times as you'd like. 

The food quality was spotty. The highlights were the pepper chicken, BBQ beef/chicken, and the beef and broccoli. The misses included the cheese mussels, the rib tips, and the spare ribs. 

The sushi was, overall, disappointing. You could tell that some of the sushi had seen better days and had obviously been prepared some time ago. 

The dessert selection was limited. The availability of ice cream scooped from buckets was nice- better than the soft serve ice cream machines at some buffets. 

If you are hungry and are careful in your food selections, then Jasmine Buffet is the place for you. If you are looking for a memorable dining experience, there are probably better choices."}
