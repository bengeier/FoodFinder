{"text":"This restaurant is delicious.  The butter chicken is terrific. The chana masala is made how you like it. Lots of flavour."}
{"text":"Great indian food in Scarborough.  You can dine in or get delivery from them through Just Eat, which is what we do. Food always arrives on time and hot. 

Butter chicken is good, as is Saag paneer.  Really everything we have tried has been very tasty

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic. Just the right amount of spice without being over powering. This family run business is just starting out but will be a neighbourhood favourite in no time. The chicken vindaloo was moist and juicy. Could not get enough of it :)!"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I have been to so far.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is relaxing.  For the quality of food the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! I am only giving 4 rather than 5 stars because they forgot to include our samosas...but the quality and flavour of the food was really terrific!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant at Kingston Rd/St. Clair and the food is EXCELLENT.  Had both the namesake Vindaloo (spicy, but very tasty) and the Butter Chicken, along with all the fixings.  They do delivery and takeout as well."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I've ordered from here before and have never had issues but today, I placed an order online and waited over an hour but nothing arrived.  Called and was told 3-5 minutes.  Nothing came.  Waited another 20 minutes and called back.  Was told driver will be there 2-5 minutes.  Again nothing.  2 hours later from the time I placed my order, I call to cancel the order.  And was told they just received the order 10 minutes ago.  They kept me on the phone trying to figure out what happened when all I wanted at this point was to cancel the order.  They were very confused and disorganized today."}
{"text":"Ok food. Had the butter chicken and it was sweeter than i would have liked. Also had the vindaloo and it really just tasted like tomato sauce.  The mango lassie was good as well as the rice we ordered but I can't remember  which one it was."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm!! I give Vindaloo 5 stars for their food, ambience and service!

We ordered their buttered chicken, spinach and cheese curry and the curry scallops. The spinach and cheese dish was my favourite!! We also ordered the garlic and original naans which were equally as delicious! The garlic naan could totally be eaten on its own because it was very flavourful.

The servers were also up to par with the food. They were constantly pouring our cups with water whenever they saw them being half full!

Also a bonus star for the free masala chai drinks the waitress gave us tonight! I will definitely order that next time!"}
{"text":"One of my three sons, husband and I just had a fabulous meal at Vindaloo. Worth the drive to this little strip of stores in the Bluffs. Lovely, clean contemporary ambiance with warm and friendly service. Now for the food... Appetizers of fantastic samosas, kebabs. Then on to the butter chicken, chicken biryani and a delicious shrimp dish... The garlic nann was perfect. Can't say enough... Not to be missed!!!!"}
{"text":"An oasis in an otherwise barren Scarborough Bluffs restaurant landscape, and worth a healthy drive if you aren't near. This is world class traditional Indian, crafted with care and cooked with top quality ingredients. 

I have had a lot of Indian over the years. Tonight I cannot recall ever eating better. Ever. 

Make a point to come by, if you love great food."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Amazing food and very good service. The butter chicken, lamb rogan josh and the tandoori roti were delicious! Highly recommend this place for families. Very cozy and clean inside too."}
{"text":"Great local take-home staple, slowly exploring more dishes. Chicken from the tandoor oven is always tasty. Garlic naan and papadum also always a safe choice. Chicken biryani and seared scallops are frequently ordered. Quality ingredients and wholesome meals. Keep up the stoke Vindaloo."}
{"text":"Great, exotic, and delicious with the best service, totally a new experience every time I'm going there. Ask for something new to try and they will give you always good options to enjoy. I'm giving 5 starts rating because it really has something good here."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Vindaloo Indian Cuisine. I ordered through their website for delivery. Half an hour later I received a call from the restaurant and was informed that there would be an added delivery charge of $7.00 for my order because I am 6km away from the restaurant as opposed to 5km, in which case, delivery would be free. Their website does not state this at all, and in fact, shows my address as within their delivery boundaries. I indicated to the woman on the phone that this should be made clear and/or they should have informed me before processing the order. She was not receptive; my partner ended up talking to her and she finally agreed to charge only $3.00 for delivery.

The food arrived at the expected time. Ordered the Paneer Masala, Aloo Gobi, rice, garlic naan, and vegetable pakoras. All in all, the food was good: hot, well-spiced, decent portions, and the naan was very fluffy. However, due to the terrible customer service experience, I will not be ordering again. Perhaps the restaurant can learn from this experience so as not to lose future potential customers. If they had agreed to waive the delivery charge for this order due to their error, I would have happily ordered again for pick up."}
{"text":"Utterly fantastic! May be the best Indian food I've ever had.  The flavours are rich, complex and vary nicely from one dish to the next.  Everything is fresh.  Naan is excellent in taste and texture.  People are warm and service is prompt.  Room is comfortable and interesting with lovely booths for 2-6 people.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for spicy food, so did a yelp search and located this restaurant. 

I am usually a huge fan of huge masala, this one I find the fish a bit soggy and it was fried before placed in the sauce. The fish lacks flavour. The butter chicken tasted better. Ambiance not bad and friendly service.

(3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"A little restaurant with good food and an amazing space. It's across from a high school so if you go during lunch time you'll sometimes have to deal with their annoying screaming but any other time this place is pristine."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken and plain naan was delicious, the naan was a bit burnt at the bottom but that's okay the buyer chicken was awesome"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've ever had. I'd recommend this spot to anyone. Amazing samosas, butter chicken and channa masala."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing 

We used to live on the edge of little India on coxwell and I have eaten a lot of Indian food in Toronto.

I've only eaten here twice, but the masala is amazing.

Not too spicy, mildly sweet just the right amount of intensity in the heat."}
{"text":"This place deserves their 5 star rating. I would consider their food gourmet Indian. We had the butter chicken, dal makhani, sang paneer and Naan. All were delicious.  The restaurant is in a non descript location and is easily missed.  The interior is simple, and the service pleasant. Try it!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice now, both times delivery.  Food was delivered hot and both times flavours were magnificent. There are many Indian places in the neighbourhood and I have finally found my go-to. Saag paneer was hearty, big chunks of paneer, and not at all soupy. Naan was a bit too doughy but lacha paratha was beautifully flakey and delicious. Chicken tandoori was the furthest thing from dry, so big win!  

Four solid stars only because I have yet to taste other dishes and have only gotten take out. So far, great representation, and can't wait to try more of what they offer."}
{"text":"I've been traveling to Toronto from Boston for work and this is hands down the best Indian food I've ever had. Ive been here twice and both times have been consistently outstanding. The service is friendly and fast, prices are reasonable, and the food is amazing.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here, I'm always skeptical of places with on review by one person who's only done one review... Okay I'm not the best person at writing reviews but am pretty good a reading ones probably written by the owner.

Anyway... Just has dinner here and  was more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.

Apps: 

Mulligatawny Soup - lentil based puree, good light citrus flavour, lots of fresh kari leaves and (fresh?) grated coconut as garnish.

Veggie pakoras - cooked to order, a bit heavy but nice flavor and came with a mild red sauce.

Mains:

Seared Scallops - cooked rare as I like them, brought back memories of eating Debu's on Bayview. Great sauce, nicely spiced that didn't overpower the taste of the scallops (did find some sand/grit in one of them). Serving size 4 large scallops. Will order again.

Butter Chicken - Not my favorite version, a bit too heavy on cinnamon (?) for my palate, though a nice heat, lots of chicken cooked correctly.

Lamb Madras - What can I say, the old chef school adage, if it tastes good with butter add some more and it will taste better - well it worked, lot's of buttery flavour and the meat was melt in my mouth tender, perfect heat.

Channa Masala - No Indian meal for e is complete without a chick pea dish. This is pretty good. Though I do have to tip my hat to Karaikudi on Kennedy as I think theirs is slightly better (Channa Batura).

Nice hot fresh perfectly cooked garlic naan, so many places make it too thick and it's doughy - not here. 

Basmati rice - nice light and fluffy, look like scented with a bit of saffron.

While we still love love and go to Anjappar & Karaikudi it's nice that there is a (relatively) new kid on the block."}
{"text":"Oh my! So good!!! I found myself constantly saying how amazing this food was/is. I purposefully made myself leave some for leftovers so I can have it for lunch the following day (I'm eating it as I type this!).

Location: There is some parking right in front of this restaurant, but heading west to arrive meant that I had to make a U-turn. There isn't a lot of parking directly in front, but you can probably find a spot on a side street nearby.

Staff: The brief interaction with staff was pleasant (I ordered online to do take out). The food was ready exactly when they said it was.

Food: I had the Chicken Korma (mild) and I am in love with it. So good! It was seasoned well, and the Garlic Naan I ordered paired extremely well with it! It was great consistency and overall it was very delicious.

I'll definitely order from them again (and maybe even try dining in at some point!)"}
{"text":"My brother has ordered from here twice. It's super delicious! It's definitely one of the better places for Indian food. The price is a bit above average but worth it when you've got the craves. We haven't been to their storefront yet, but will one of these days."}
{"text":"Not what I expected
I want to start this review with a note that the owners tried to explain the food and were very kind. I've eaten many Indian dishes over the years (a few very, very good - both abroad and in Canada) so I'm confident to express my opinion. We came here mid week, hoping to find another \"hidden gem\" as we haven't found many wonderful Indian restaurants in the east end of Toronto and we had read the wonderful reviews. The place was empty, except for a few take out orders coming in to pick up or deliver. We ordered an appetizer plate first, then our meals of lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka Marsala. It started with a totally disappointing appetizer experience. I wish I had taken a picture, but the flattened, smooth golf-ball sized and shaped pakora (and after asking the waitress where my onion bhaji was as I didn't recognize it on the plate. Found out they were there but were exact same shape, size, colour and texture of the pakora was that only way to tell the difference was to see green on the outside). These were definitely not the onion bhaji and pakoras I've known to love and enjoy. I was told they just make them different - oddly shaped like the frozen ones I've seen at Indian supermarkets. And the samosas? A nice taste but unfortunately filled with soft mashed potatoes vs. a nice textured filling. The menu said papadams were included with what I had ordered, but when I inquired about those missing off the appetizer plate too, I was told they don't serve them anymore as people in the area wanted gluten free. And that totally had me flumixed. Papadams ARE gluten free. So I just asked them to package up the rest of our order for takeout as I was pretty certain the rest would be the same. Yes, I was disappointed. I will just finish this to say the rest of the food was mediocre. Both other meat dishes used heat vs having depth of flavor. I love heat, but it has to accompany the complex delicious flavours that Indian food is famous for. And this just didn't have it. So for us, we didn't find that hidden gem we were hoping to find. And price point? high - in my opinion for their offerings."}
{"text":"Vindaloo has been on our radar for a while now, but when it comes to Indian food in Scarborough, we normally go to our two favorite South Indian spots. Tonight, we decided to be brave and finally try this restaurant - we were not disappointed.

Not sure what we're were expecting, but when we opened the front door we found a beautifully decorated clean restaurant in immaculate condition playing nice relaxing authentic Indian Music which set the mood for the delicious food.

There was two of us, my husband and myself, and we shared the Vegetable Pakoras and a bowl of Muligitawny Soup. The Pakoras were good, but the soup was wonderful - very intricate flavours with an undertone of citrus.

For our mains we had Seared Scallops in a masala sauce (the Scallops were perfectly coooked and the flavour authentic but didn't overpower the Scallops,) Lamb Madras (delicious!), Butter Chicken (my husband thought there was too much cinnamon, but I thought it was perfect), and Channa Masala (again, delicious). We topped that off with some rice and Garlic Naan which was so fresh and light and awesome.

I know that's a lot of food for two people, but we always order enough for lunch the next day.

Finally, have to mention the service was excellent as well. The server was friendly and attentive.

Now we have three Indian restaurants to call our own out here plus we (barely) made it into their delivery area, so we can also have it delivered."}
{"text":"We'd been there a few weeks back and absolutely loved. Recommended a friend who is a chef and he loved it too. Will continue to recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"What can I say about my experience at Vindaloo?
The food, the atmosphere and the service were all incredible! 
10 out of 10.
From the minute we were greeted at this quiet and upscale restaurant to the time we were finished, everything was great. The naan was crisp and steamy, butter chicken tasted like it was straight from Delhi and the tandoori chicken was brought to the table sizzling. 
The only thing hotter than the food was my date!
Joy, our server, was incredible and truly was what made our experience memorable.
We will definitely be coming back and would encourage anyone to come and enjoy this fantastic restaurant.
Thanks again Joy, for your hospitality and the amazing food!

{"text":"Truly the best Butter Chicken I have ever had. The staff were very nice and humble. Just fabulous!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical of this place because it was empty when I walked in. However the food is excellent. The food didn't take long to come out. I had two curry dishes and a rice to share and it came out to around 30 dollars. It was a bit expensive for a smaller dish but I would probably come back if I was in the area"}
{"text":"I'm first time here.
It's a nice place,  nice food, nice service.
I order appetizers  and main course to gather.
I was expecting  appetizer should be served first, so main course will be served hot also but unfortunately  they served all once so main course was got cold when start eating."}

{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I must say that I have just had the best curry of my life. I ordered the chicken madras with garlic naan. The combinations of flavors and the creaminess left me loving every morsel."}
