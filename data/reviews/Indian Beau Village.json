{"text":"My fav desi resto. Best bang for your buck on the Jarry side of Park Ex.   Channa Bhatura is #1, the Thalis are great (and large), and they always ask if I want it spicy or not (which can be difficult you have a a condition known as gora chamadee).   Hot tip: Try the chana samosa or aloo tikki chana if you need a very cheap but substantial meal (the quality of this item tends to vary every time i get it but its cheap and when it's good it's great!)  I'll be bringing my future grandchildren to eat here."}
{"text":"Ok food.  Staffs have bad manners.  Menu is too crowded to choose dishes.  Place looks dirty, with bad decorations."}
{"text":"Hmmm So they changed their location from the corner to this \"then\" greek restaurant. The ambiance was not at all indian at all. As I was waiting for the food I couldnt help but notice the awkward room decor. Nothing in this place screamed indian except for the food and the waiter serving us. Anyway I came here on a Sunday evening so on average a good time for restaurants to be busy. Our server was okay so dont expect to be blown away by the service. The good part here? The food. The food was GREAAAATT. GREAATT G R E A T. Okay thats enough but seriously this is one of the second times I've had food by a female chef at a desi joint. When I saw the lady behind the door I was happy. Generally (not being discriminating here) but ladys cooking desi food always makes me happy as they always put the right amount of every ingredient making the food more homely feeling rather then commercial. So there we go! Indian food as close to mama's feel as you can get. Oh and I ordered all non veg food since it was an Indian locals restaurant. I absolutely loved their channa bhatura, naan with palak paneer and rajma daal. Yumm. Didnt get a chance to have any of the drinks or desserts but looked well promising. Definitely wont be my last trip here :) Kudos!!!"}
