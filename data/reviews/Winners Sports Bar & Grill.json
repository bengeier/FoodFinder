{"text":"Flight delayed so I came to Winners to have a snack and glass of wine. Can't go wrong with chicken tenders. Atmosphere was good and service was good."}
{"text":"Flew into Cleveland and was having my parents pick me up at the airport. However I told them my flight was delayed so I could rack 4 hours of drinking. Since they still own 2 VCR's calling my bluff on the internet was impossible.  It's the name that pulled me in: Winner's. It's 7:45 AM and I'm having drinks-this is winning in the full Charlie Sheen sense. Drinking in this bar before noon is the closest any of us will get to being in the dugout while someone is pitching a no-hitter: everyone knows what is happing but no one is talking about it. And the \"it\" is morning drinking without judgement. Maybe you're on vacation, maybe you have some unpleasant business to attend to or maybe you drive a school bus and don't want to have fingers pointed at you for having a Jack and Coke to take the edge off.  The bartenders are the key to the place. Not only do they need to pass a security check to work here, they need to be versed in sign language as we work on a system of head movements and quick finger gestures to conduct business. Here are the signals:  NOD - Dude... Over here. SINGLE FINGER - Hit me. 2 FINGERS - I want the double for $2 more. THUMB OVER SHOULDER - Going to the bathroom. THUMB OVER SHOULDER FOLLOWED BY EXTENDED PINKY - Hit me again while I'm in the bathroom. WAVING HAND UNDER CHIN WITH FINGERS IN TIGHT FORMATION - Give me the check, I'm going to the brew house in concourse B."}
{"text":"Food was average.  Server was nice.  Ordered a soft drink. When the server notices my ice filled glass was empty she offered a refill for the full price. She knew it was awkward and abnormal to charge and said it was a new policy. Should have mentioned it first. I only ate there for the fountain soda."}
{"text":"Just had a grill cheese and fries - 6$!  Very reasonable prices and good bar type food with some Southern options. One of the better restaurants I have eaten at in a airport. Prices as good or better than a small neighborhood bar. Highly recommended.  Across from gate C23 at Cleveland International Airport.  Service was polite and prompt, they must have fixed the issues described in other reviews."}
{"text":"This restaurant is listed as being open from 5 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily on the Cleveland airport website.  Be prepared to be rudely scolded and told \"We're closed.\" at 8:15 by Melissa and staff."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and grab a drink before a flight!! Alba is the best bartender ever!!!!"}
{"text":"The Worst. ..  The  time i spent trynna flagg down the 5 people behind the counter came to a ugly end when the youthful black woman was rude ,curt, snatched my money  and was talking smack under her breath... I will never come back and hope you have a better  experience.... the drink  was strong though.... I would  rather  be car jacked then ever use this service  again"}
{"text":"Being greeted by smiling faces at 5:15 am was a great start to my travel day. Shaleea, the bartender and server, was warm, engaging, and provided outstanding service. The breakfast wrap was perfectly cooked and priced inline with expected airport prices."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of eating at this restaurant when I arrived at Cleveland Hopkins airport. I sat down because the employee on the Togo line assured me that ordering at the table was most efficient. I order a simple meal of hot dog fries and a mixed bevrage. Except I had to place my order 3 times with different employees. Some of which were intoxicated. 35 minutes in i get my mixed drink things are starting to look up and I expect the food to come shorty... wrong. Another 30 minutes go by and in a rush I see them making my food. 5 minutes later I get my food and immediately ask for the check because people in airports usually have flights to catch and don't have 55 minutes to wait for a hotdog. Honestly this is the worst customer experience I have received I'm my life and I wish to never return to this sad excuse for a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. The attitude of the servers is dreadful. They don't care that you are there - you are a nuisance to them. They don't care when your flight is or whether you get what you ordered. I had to cancel an order after 25 minutes - and it was just a burger! Please avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Very slow and disinterested service.. the guys working there seem to make it a point to avoid acknowledging customers waiting.  Overpriced and sketchy food."}
{"text":"Food took 30 minutes. The veggie wrap was so soaked in oil it was not edible.  Fries were cold and the \"French onion\" soup had no cheese,  which basically made it onion soup. Yuck"}
{"text":"Do yourself a huge favor - with so many options - skip this place. Food is mediocre at best, wait staff has forgotten they work at an airport and service is terrible. Couldn't get a menu upon arrival - that took 5 minutes. To order took another 5 minutes. Subpar burger came out quick....but no napkins or place setting to cut it in half. After attempting to flag down one of the 3 servers, I ventured where the waitstaff was and got my needed supplies....you guessed it....food was cold by the time I dug in. To get my check was like an act of congress, seriously disappointed and wish I would have opted for one of the other options. Save yourself while there is still time!"}
{"text":"Ok. It's a bar not a breakfast spot. We were on a layover from california. Passed the Italian breakfast buffet to winners. The breakfast menu has 5 items to choose from. I asked for an extra egg and I ask for scrambled. I got 2 under cooked over easy practically raw eggs and the 3rd egg was scrambled?! Wtf there is basically nowhere to eat at this airport. Stick to donuts cuz apparently it's hard to get a good breakfast at the loser airport bar called winners. There is over a foot of snow in April and nowhere to eat. Why do people live here? I'm headed back to Cali."}
{"text":"Awful service. Not busy and service is super slow! Onion rings burnt and still waiting on sauce that was suppose to come with them...sweet tea will rot your teeth it's so sweet..."}
{"text":"Only bar open in the evening in Concourse A. I would recommend staying far away. You will hear all about the personal lives of the staff - including their phone conversations (held over speaker phone) at the bar with potential suitors. Last call is at 8pm, pretty early. Food selection is limited (potato skins, wings, chicken tenders, hot dogs) and looked very unappealing."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have ever experienced. I waited more than 30 minutes for eggs over easy, bacon, potatoes & toast. When my order finally came I received eggs almost raw, sausage (not bacon) & toast (no potatoes). My server gave me a 10% discount for my trouble. For the first time in my life, I left no tip. While I was waiting, one guy who had been waiting a long time made a fuss, and was assured his breakfast would come soon, & be boxed for to-go. He ended up running to his gate without eating because he was so late. I'd rename this dive \"Losers!\""}
{"text":"The first time I've ever given zero tip. Sheesh. Everybody there was cool except for our server, and it only takes one to make a terrible experience. The food was good, drink was good, but damn the customer service was terrible from the server. From the moment I asked for a drink to leaving, I got this frustrated attitude. For the ID, asking about the food, asking if moving tables was ok (squished seats vs open table), everything! Never got asked if we wanted anything, more to drink, and didn't even pick up the check. We all work lady, but not all of us are totally rude about it!   The other employees were really nice. One of them even had to talk over her rudeness when I asked to switch seats. It's too bad I didn't get served by one of them to begin with!   Oh well, at least the chicken philly was really good. Came with yummy fries too. Shoulda got it to go!"}
{"text":"The salmon salad is top 5 airport food anywhere.  I know salmon at an airport in Cleveland???   The chef knows how to grill salmon.  The rest of the salad is basic nothing special.  The salmon is amazing!  And only 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Second time here last time was breakfast. Heading to Europe got here early beer, Quesadilla and a burger with Regina. All excellent. Last time breakfast was great as well."}
{"text":"This place looked pretty good until we talked to our server. She was rude. And when I say rude I mean she snapped at me to show her ID, she didn't show me a menu, she served my fiancee a major dose of snarky attitude along with his drink, and then she sarcastically told us to \"have a good one\" when we left. The only time she came to our table after serving my man a drink was to leave the bill, and she didn't even come and take it back to the register for processing. We had to take the bill up ourselves to pay.  I hate my job too but I have a little dignity and I do feel responsible enough to perform my job right.  This place makes Ohio seem like los Angeles.  Boo!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito, it was big large made with real scrambled eggs, red peppers,and cheese. $6.99 is pretty cheap for airport food, especially for the amount of food. Quick and filling! Probably beats the Starbucks wrap option and the other restaurant near by is double the cost."}
{"text":"I was flying out of CLE and had some time to kill so I stopped by Winners to get a Polish Boy. Great choice, the sandwich was awesome. The only problem that I had was how messy the sandwich is. I couldn't pick it up cause the Cole slaw made the bread all soggy. I'm just glad nobody was in the boarding area when I ate it cause it was a mess but still good. As far as customer service I didn't have a problem cause I wasn't pressed for time but I can tell this isn't a place u want to go if your in a rush."}
{"text":"It's hard to expect much from an airport bar but being based out of Cleveland I spend a lot of time in this airport. And out of all the bars in Hopkins, you'll never find a more disinterested staff.  You could be 1 of 7 people in the bar and out of 3 bartenders you'll need to perform gymnastics to get any of their attention.   One feature paramount for airport bars is quick turnover and speed, that is the absolute last way I would ever define this bar.   Nice people though"}
{"text":"Two stars for the quickness of the line, however service is awful. Tara was the cashier and was short and rude the entire time before and when ordering.  As if I was supposed to know no substitutions at all. Simply tell me.  However the gentleman making my order was nice.  Customer service needs some work overall.  Hope at least the food is good."}
{"text":"The food was great I got the pulled pork with coleslaw fries. All of the gentleman who work there were all very sweet, friendly, and had excellent customer service.   On the other hand the bartender is a greedy wench with the worst customer service! Even though I bought food there because I was not buying a drink and she was not going to make money off of me, she told me I had to leave and I was not allowed to sit at the tables and eat my food that I just bought there. She made me leave she said unless I bought something from her I could not sit there. I then went to the counter and asked the guys if bought something here and did not buy a drink from her could I still sit there? They said yes of course!   So I went back and sat down, she came over and told me unless I was buying something from her that I had to leave. I said that is not true she huffed and puffed and wanted to know who said that, after telling her she went over and through a fit with the boys.    Mean while 3 separate customers came in did the exact same thing and not a word was said. Then after I left sitting across the way where the plug ins are by the window another woman bartender started making fun of the whole situation to the original insulting bartender after all customers had left. The original insulting bartender then said well what is she gonna do about it. Completely inappropriate and rude.... So here it is this is what I did about it. I didn't get the bartenders name. I  took a picture of the bartender but I don't feel right about posting her pic on the internet. Both bartenders had dark blackish hair lighter skin 7/10/17  2:24pm  3 stars are because of the guys the guys deserve a 5 star rating...! The were awesome, personal, welcoming, and approachable...  The bartender deserves no stars..."}
{"text":"This is one of two bar/grill places in the airport, but it has an attached take-out section (which was how I thought you bought food and non-alcoholic beverages). They had a chicken quesadilla that looked good, so I got that.  It was as good as it looked.  That earned the two stars.  As I was waiting, I saw that the attached bar had an MLS soccer game going on, so I grabbed a table and sat eating my quesadilla and drinking my bottled pop.  The cocktail waitress came over and tried to take my drink order.  I don't drink; I told her I was drinking pop.  30 minutes later...with 6 minutes left to go in the game (and warmup for the Cavs game starting) she rudely kicked me out because I hadn't ordered from the bar.  She wouldn't even let me finish watching my game!!!  This \"rule\" is posted nowhere."}
{"text":"Almost missed my flight because of their slow service. Horrible place. Will never EVER dine there."}
{"text":"Worst airport bar/grill ever, horrible costumer service and the bartender with the pit bull tattoo is Extremely rude and verbally attacked my friend for pointing that out to her. Will never, ever, EVER bee back again//// if it was possible this place wouldn't even get 1 star."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. Airport location.  I ordered chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks. The female cashier with dirty blonde hair took down my order, put the items in the fryer, and disappeared. Ten minutes later, a guy comes out from a break, I guess, looks in the fry basket and threw away the food. Overcooked. He put new ones in, and apologized to me when I told him it was probably mine. The female cashier comes out, goes straight to the bar next door, and starts talking to another coworker, about nails (they were examining each other's hands). In the meantime, a line is forming, and the guy in the food prep area is stuck doing all the work - cashier and food prepping. Where's management when you need it? Food took 20minutes to come out. Too long. Me in the meantime? Telling everyone who was in line not to order from this establishment because the female cashier was shirking her job."}
{"text":"Too bad.  I was really hoping this experience could be positive but things were just not good by ANY standard.  Located in the heart of Terminal A, this is a quick bite to eat if you select the carry out side and not sit down.  I think this is my mistake.  Upon arrival, seems like any usual quick eats location.  Chips, drinks on the outside of the cashier, pizza waiting to be purchased sitting behind a window, cashier and 2 cooks waiting to take orders.  When it was my turn to order I was greeted with a \"Welcome to Winners, what do you want?\" The tone and demeanor of the cashier was unfriendly to the point where I felt I was bothersome.  Brushed it off, and ordered the \"number\" on the menu.  The immediate response was an eye roll and \"what is that number?\"  After responding I was given a \"oOOOooh that one, a Winner's Burger.\"  The tone had a bit of snark in it as if I was expected to just order the name after the number that was sitting in front of it that was showing on the menu board.  After paying, I stood back and watched to see if it was just me receiving treatment or if it was everyone.  Everyone got it, until a friend who worked at another establishment came.  Demeanor became very casual, smiles and laughs, and talking of \"whatchu gonna do after work guuurl?!?!\" all while taking the order of another customer was the hot topic of conversation.  Reading the facial expression and body language of this customer was obvious she was bothered by it, but she did not want to say anything.  I waited a solid 20 minutes for my order of a burger and fries, and half of that time, the fries say there on the counter with lid open getting cold.  Burger came out but was not cooked to order.  Based on timing I could not afford to go back as I had to get to my plane.  Burger was ordered medium well but came back well done x3 and nearly had a crispy texture to it.  My fries had been solid and cold upon arrival which was bothersome as it could have been closed while I waited and not left open.  Altogether, I feel a sit down experience may be better, but these three employees working the carry out side seem to be very disconnected with customer service and only there to have fun with each other.  No urgency with service, no common sense to food service standards.  Disappointing to say the least.  If you go, give yourself time to enjoy a sit down experience."}
{"text":"I seldom write reviews & never for airport establishments but prob some of the worst service ever. From forgetting my drink order (twice) to short pouring the beer when it did come (twice) to greasy quesadillas & neglecting us - this place was terrible. Go to Sammy Hagar's just a couple gates down."}
{"text":"Sjitty at attitude for bar keep. Asked for a beer and he said I'll get to you when I can. The were two people at bar and two sitting down at small tables., 20 minutes later he comes asked for my order. Really.? Spent the time shipping non occupied and already clean tables and shipping bar"}
{"text":"The people that work here are rude and inconsiderate, it gets two stars because the food ain't that bad, it's the people that are rude and run a disorganized business. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Never came around for a refill and had to go to bar to pay the bill.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"}
{"text":"The burger was really good, bought t that is where the good stops. It took about 30 mins to get my food and when I finally got the food, the fries were cold.   I had to ask for the check from the bartender because my waitress was off talking on the phone in the corner. I also had to ask the bartender for a refill since my waitress was 'busy'."}
{"text":"Good breakfast friendly people. Very happy eating. First cook to nail eggs over medium in a long while. I would def come here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"This is one of the many restaurants targeted at travelers waiting for flights on C concourse.  Nice selection of alcoholic beverages and your basic limited pub menu.  Food was ok, service ok.  Nothing special, but nothing bad.  Nice place to recharge while waiting for a flight."}
{"text":"The polish boy was good. The service is extremely and I repeat extremely slow and really bad at best. You may need a cow bell or bull horn to get the waitresses to take your order. Then once you get a drink don't expect refills or any questions on how things are. Waited over 25 minutes for my food and it's just a hotdog on a bun with a few fries and coleslaw on top with bbq sauce. I have been here a few times and the service is always poor no matter how empty the place is. Glad nobody is in a hurry in the airport...... oh ya everyone is."}
{"text":"Breakfast potatoes are grilled with onions and eggs. Service was quick and delivered within 5 mins. Portions were above standard!! Very please!"}
{"text":"Mean waitress, sub par food.  Waitress was a dark hair Latino woman, work at gate a6 location at 5pm on 2/14/17.  There were no tables available so I ordered takeout.  Luckily a table opened up and I grabbed it.  She came up to me and told me to take my order, I explained what happened but wouldn't let me sit at a table even though I had an order in, said I had to order through her.  When I tried to explain that it said seat yourself, she raised her voice at me in front of several customers.  A bit embarrassing, like I was back in grade school.  Never again.  Cheesesteak was garbage."}
{"text":"Staff is unfriendly and not personable. I saw the bartender give a customer a half filled beer from the keg that blew and actually charge him. Service is slow as well. If my math is anywhere near to being right a coors light is marked up to make a 300+% which is a little ridiculous. A coors light is $8 and a Mimosa is $11."}
{"text":"Because if you're not winning, you're LOSING aaaaand I'm always winning. With that said, i ordered a beer there.   Go get yourself a winning drink if you're flying United!"}
{"text":"Winners is a new Sports Bar & Grill located in Concourse C of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport - right across from Gate C23.  4 large flat panel HD TVs, a long bar, lots of tables and chairs, and a basic bar pub grub menu.  I built my own burger: cheddar, bacon, jalapeños, lettuce, onion, tomato, and mayo, plus fries.  Burger was tasty and hot, fries were crispy and hot.   Good place to pass some time waiting for a flight."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a flight and both hadn't eaten since lunch. It was 5pm and my other half and I were hungry, and Winners was right next to our gate.   We stood in the \"To Go\" line for a good 5 minutes before someone from the sit down area asked us if we were wanting to sit at the bar or take the food to go. We told her we had time to kill, so she brought us over to her side. She was manning everything: The bar, the floor, everything. She was very efficient and friendly.  We ordered a veggie quesadilla and a slice of pizza. Both were sub par - nothing special. The prices were decent though, which at the airport is hardly ever seen. I did ask her what the price for a bloody mary would be and she told me $10 with cheap vodka. No thank you.  Either way, it was a good place to pass the time, but if my gate is near there the next time I fly, I'll probably try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Utter dumpster fire of an establishment. 6 beers on tap- one was cider, one was Sam Adams something-or-other (which didn't work) and the other four were macrobrew swill. 15 bottles available- one was nonalcoholic, one was an IPA (which was sold out, duh), one was Guinness, and the rest were also shit lager.   Service was alright- fast and as friendly as you'd expect in the Cleveland airport. But the girl at the counter told me to go to Sammy's (as in Hagar, the \"Red Rocker\" of post-DLR Van Halen) if I wanted better beer. Owners, if you're reading this- you don't need Coors Light, Yuengling and Bud Light occupying half your tap handles. It's depressing. Especially with having the Frontier gates near your spot, which brings in traffic from places like Denver and Portland where people actually give a toot."}
{"text":"Missed a flight. Been here two days in a row. Love the service, atmosphere, and of course the bartenders(Yvette especially). Prices are outrageous, as always in an airport, but the bloody's are so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I was very extremely disappointed with the wings at the Winner's Sports Bar at the Cleveland airport.  These were \"hands-down\" the worst wings I've ever tasted in my entire life. I ordered six wings for lunch, and 12 wings for take out for the evening. The only wings that were palatable where the wings with barbecue sauce on it. I ordered spicy Cajun wings along with another variety of the wings they offered, and they had to be the worst I've ever tasted.  They were not only bland, but almost inedible. I would recommend avoiding Winner's Sports Bar at the Cleveland airport at all costs."}
{"text":"YOU WILL ONLY LOSE AT WINNERS I travel through this airport often out of gate C.  Right across from C23 is Winners.  It ain't.  Should be called LOSERS (the way Trump says it too).  I am done being an idiot and keep going here until they fire Toya.  I am sorry to call out someone specifically, but she's been there for awhile and has the most god awful attitude ever.  It's not just that it's like she's doing you a favor, but she makes you feel like you disgust her.  There is no other word than downright disrespectful.  Not even a remote attempt at minimal politeness.  Just grunts, if that.  Ruins the entire experience and makes one feel very unwelcome.  And I am not the only one who complains about the service here with all the other 1 and 2 star ratings.  The owner of this restaurant needs to make some staff changes or train Toya to be respectful and polite.  Either that our airport management should change the sign to LOSERS, because that is what one is made to feel like eating there.  BTW, the one star is for the food.  Nothing special and priced accordingly.  Do yourself a favor and hit any of the other restaurants in the C concourse.  You will only Lose at Winners."}
{"text":"I don't have a ton of expectations for any airport restaurants, and I usually don't review places...I was really irritated by this visit, though. I was with my 7 year old son. He's not a super picky eater but peppers and mushrooms are \"absolutely not\" items for him. He wanted the chicken quesadillas, I noticed on the menu that they had been peppers in them, so I ordered them without peppers. 25 minutes later, they came. He opened one to put sour cream on it, and he said \"mushrooms?!?\" I took a peek and sure enough, the quesadillas were packed with chicken, cheese and mushrooms. I double checked the menu, nowhere did it say mushrooms. I flagged the waitress down, showed her, and asked if the quesadillas were supposed to include mushrooms. She said \"Yeah, they have mushrooms.\" I pointed out that it wasn't in the menu description, and she said \"Oh yeah, we keep forgetting to reprint the menus. Sorry.\" That was it. We had a flight to make, so I didn't have time to order something else for him, so instead I painstakingly picked all the mushrooms out. It wasn't the waitresses fault, but I thought maybe a few bucks off the bill?? Nope. Just know that if you order quesadillas, you're gonna get mushrooms. My chicken strips were unremarkable. Service was pretty slow for an airport."}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if I could because that is the service we received there. The staff (aka bodies standing around consuming air) were rude and basically refused to serve customers \"yet\" despite their hours saying they were open. There was hot food ready that they were enjoying themselves but told us \"The bar is open if you'd like a drink.\" No, I don't want a Bloody Mary as 5:30 am. They hung around and joked around with one another while the first wave of air travel passengers were turned away. If I were their boss, I would fire them on the spot for losing business and misrepresenting the name \"Winners\" by being a bunch of losers. So far, our whole CLE airport experience has been mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Worst coffee at the airport! Taste like it was made yesterday,"}
{"text":"I had an hour wait for my flight so the attendant suggested Winners. I would not call it a winner. I had to wait over 45 minutes between ordering my food and having it delivered to me at my table in a to-go box!!! The food was good but the wait is way too long and it is unclear why the wait is so long unless all of the Winners in the airport share the same kitchen. I was not able to finish my food before my flight so I ended up being the weirdo on the plane the to-go box that everyone is staring at (lol). No more Winners for me unless I have a LONG layover."}
{"text":"The bottled water was cold.  That's about the only positive thing we could say about the whole experience.  After seeing my piece of pizza boxed up and waiting I asked how much longer for the grilled chicken...when the cook proceeded to take it out of the fridge and start cooking it. I took the pizza to eat so it wouldn't get too much colder while the chicken cooked. Were then treated to this tasty looking piece of lettuce.  It's true airport food.  Just hoping diarrhea doesn't set in at 30,000-ft."}
{"text":"Stopped by because there wasn't that much to eat around concourse C...of at least from what I saw. Had a chicken quesadilla which wasn't very forgettable. However, the bartender Toya makes a pretty good mojito"}
{"text":"Utterly worthless.  You had one thing to do and you f'ed it up. $15 for a bloody mary,  then scamming me into upgrading the liquor to non well (for $4 more).  Then i asked for it extra spicy.you just dumped the mix in with the hooch.  Thats it.  Not worth it even in time of desperate need."}
{"text":"There was food and drinks being served to people and we were told that they were closed. It was 9:40PM! There were tons of waiting customers outside and they were declining us. On top of that they made everyone feel bad and guilty saying: \"well we are already later than we should be staying open\".  Hostage audience yes, but let's still be nice."}
{"text":"It's your average airport restaurant. That means they know that you the customer probably won't ever be returning, and you probably won't stick around long enough to spread the word about your experience. Well Yelp exists now, and though I doubt it will significantly impact their business, it won't need to because this restaurant is quite plain even if we're not evaluating it by airport standards.  I ordered chicken tenders for an appetizer and a salmon salad as the main course. They came to the table at the same time after 16 minutes of my ordering, which in all honesty kind of defeats the purpose of having an appetizer. What's more is that the chicken tenders were pretty hard; I thought chicken tenders were supposed to be tender. There were only four of them (the menu didn't specify this), and they were neither good nor too terrible.  The salmon salad that came along with it was simply okay. It consisted of grilled salmon, lettuce, cucumber, cheese, onions, tomatoes, and a slice of lemon. What's strange is that they also included chopped hard-boiled eggs in a separate cup. The salmon was a bit dry, just like the chicken, but it was tolerable. The rest of the salad was generic.  Overall, this is not an outstanding restaurant, though it did manage to keep me fed during my travel. The food could have been better, it could have come out faster, and I think I ended up paying too much. But the server Alba was nice and I didn't have much of a problem with the place otherwise. Don't expect anything amazing at Winners. Just grab a quick bite and go."}
{"text":"When flying Spirit Airlines, the Greyhound of the skies, it helps to have a bar nearby to while away the hours while you wait. And wait. And wait some more. Although I checked in on Yelp at the only Winners listed, on the C Concourse, this review is for the Winners on the A Concourse, near gate A2. It's a tiny place, just a few high tops and about a dozen seats at the bar. Our bartenders, Yvette and AJ, were stellar and kept the drinks coming throughout the evening. On arrival, the joint was hopping with some great R&B / hip hop music and the vibe was super chill, with a wonderfully diverse group of patrons.  Since there was nothing on the menu I could eat (Celiac disease - no gluten for me) I can only vouch for the excellent bar service and great drinks. Thanks, AJ and Yvette, for helping my husband and I while away a few hours in the Cleveland airport. You helped make our return flight way more fun!"}
{"text":"I give 5 stars.  Firehouse burger was great and fast friendly service!  Fries fresh and hot and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Really quick stop before my next flight, I didn't have much time to spend here, wish I had because everything looked so good. Stopped by for a quick drink, so glad I did!   Went back for a second time, two weeks later. Is it just Cleveland or just this airport? People are so rude! It took forever for someone to ask me for my order ( not as long as that terrible lakeside brewery) but my server, Tiffeny took my order of salmon salad and a glass of wine. The salad was ok- you could tell the lettuce was kind of old but the salmon was cooked well. The downside of this was that they closed really early and I wanted to get another drink, and if Tiffeny hadn't been so nice here was no way I could have gotten my second glass of wine. People were def rushed out of there before they were ready and a lot of people didn't get drinks because they closed so early. Get it together Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Noticed that the menu you is U.G.L.Y. (and yelp says they ain't got no alibi). Graphic design and decent photos go a long way, but you know, sometimes the food is equally oppositely delicious compared to the ugliness of the menu. Old diners, you know? But somehow I don't think this place has been here since the fifties serving delicious homemade goodness.   I'm having a beer (minus the \"shot\" for $4 extra bucks) and some bacon cheese fries. Ain't no thang; they were really delish. Real bacon bits and plenty of melted cheese. I will also add that the service has been lovely. I'm just scared to go any deeper into the menu. If I do, I will update y'all."}
{"text":"I've been waiting outside this place and have witnessed two altercations; One the bartender (Blk female) had a male walk out on her and into the restrooms while with other customers starts getting loud telling a coworker \"he's n the restroom go get him\" mid sentence while with two gentlemen. Second was a husband and wife arguing with a tall Blk employee. Which all 3 people were yelling at each other. The husband gets security. Not sure what happened with this situation but the husband kept walking back and forth looking into the bar.   Personally being a bystander feel the staff is extremely unprofessional and could have handled both situations differently and quietly.   I gave two stars because I didn't try the food."}
{"text":"Food was alright... The wrap was stuffed with ranch. The waitress was slow with service. I also saw her eating out of a bowl of french fries the cooks left for her near all the waiting orders. Not only that but a cook was munching on food in the kitchen while getting tasks done. Overall bad staff and a overpriced meal."}

{"text":"My flight was delayed so I decided to grab a beer and some food.  The choices are limited at the Cleveland airport, so I chose Winners. The beer was $8.00 per 16ish oz. not ok, especially when the beers are shitty. The food was terrible. I got a quesadilla (vegetarian) and it was so greasy that it was almost inedible. The service was fine, not great but not terrible. However, I do take issue that the same deals are not provided for women as they are for men. I ordered a beer and my server just said ok, and got it. For the man sitting next to me, the server offered him a beer and shot deal. Why was I not offered this same deal? I noticed the same behavior with the other male patrons. Had I been offered the deal, I would've taken it. Unfortunately, the staff prefers to discriminate against female patrons. Would I have been charged for the shot should I have ordered it with my beer? Probably. This is one reason, and the main reason that I will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was standard bar fare, no complaints. The service was TERRIBLE. My waitress did not check on me AT ALL after giving me my food. Not like we're in an airport and expecting timely service or anything.... also... no free refills. I was almost late for my flight because of the poor service."}
