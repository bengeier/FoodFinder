{"text":"I've been there twice. The first time I watched a very large cockroach stroll from the kitchen into the dining room & hang out until I finally got the attention of a waitress to take care of it. It was waved off as just a fluke. The second time I went, about 6 months later, I watched a waitress stick her finger into a tea pitcher & then lick it to see if it was sweet or unsweet. Never again."}
{"text":"My mom brought me here because she has been several times and says its good (she's a tough critic).

I had the lasagna which was a nice sized portion and pretty good I must say.  It came with a fresh salad and the dressing was homemade, not the watered down stuff.

My sister ate the pork chops and said those were good and the fries were crispy and delicious.

My mom has tried everything but this time she had a BBQ sandwich and claimed she would order it again. 

The staff was very friendly and cordial.  My only complain was the stuffing in the booths are a little worn out and not so comfy anymore."}
{"text":"Great southern food. BBQ and ribs are great.  The sides are southern cooking including the okra and hushpuppies.  Decor is old school 50s.  Service even late is quick and friendly.  Ice tea is sweet, is there any other kind?"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not real hard to please but I went for bbq. It wasn't good. The sauces are made in-house but they weren't good either. The vinegar was just that, vinegar with so much pepper in it that it solidifies in the bottom. Fries were good. Baked beans were good but possibly canned. Potato salad should not have carrots in it. But maybe that's me."}
{"text":"I hesitated to try Billy's due to the lackluster yelp ratings but finally gave in to my husband's suggestion one day. What a pleasant surprise! 
Billy's is much more than a BBQ place, with a hand written menu full of specials besides the regular menu. Our waitress recommended a few things on the special menu, such as fried chicken, chicken tips and fried flounder. I ordered the fried flounder with 2 sides, my husband the BBQ plate. 
My 2 sides were turnip greens and baked sweet potato, and I also found some fries beneath the flounder filets, to my surprise. Even more surprisingly, the turnip greens and fries were both the best I have had for a long time. The fried flounder was also very good. In the end I did not have room for the sweet potato, cornbread and hush puppies ( did I mention they also threw that on my plate?) 
By the time we finished our lunch, the restaurant was packed with Sunday after church crowd. I guess most people there don't use Yelp! 
We will definitely return to try more stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"A great place for good home cooked meals.    We eat their often both in a group of around 10 and just us two.  The food is always hot and fresh and the service is quite good. Their BBQ is very good but I like the fish which is always a good choice."}
{"text":"Billy's has redeemed themselves since the fire. We eat there a few times a month. Their roast beef is really good. It's cooked how I like it and tender. Our service has been good the past few times we've been back. I'm glad it's getting back to the way it was before the fire."}
{"text":"Food used to be good before the fire and grade was good but the last time we went here the grade was in the 80's which we did not notice untill we went to check out. Several things happened the last time we were here  that made us decide to never return.  1st the waitress dropped her pen in the pitcher of tea dug it out then poured it into another tables cups. 2nd the food was not good, Greasy okra, bland chicken, very little chicken in the chicken tips mostly gravy n onions, fries were cold and hard, and the burgers were not cooked well. 3rd the bus boy literally swept the dirt off the floor and dumped it on dishes in the bin. Some people might not see a problem with that but to me that's just gross. If the sanitation grade was higher and the staff cared about a clean restaurant I think it return to the old billys."}
{"text":"Good food reasonably priced. Great staff. Just a plain country diner with a good variety of almost any item. All very good. Good for a medium sized group. Children welcome."}
{"text":"Hubs & I looking to try something different, \"yelp\" sent us here. Service was amazing. Quick to get our food out, my burger was great, real juicy. My hubs bragged about his footlong. Will definitely be back."}
