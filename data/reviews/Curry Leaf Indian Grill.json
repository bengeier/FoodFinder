{"text":"My experience is not based on my dining, I am writing just at the attitude I was given when I called to inquire about the place. While browsing on the net, I came across this restaurant that advertised on the uniqueness of the menu/ concept.  Being a 40 mile drive from my place, I called to inquire more about the whole concept they were selling.....And LO!!!! What an Attitude!!! The lady on the other side is not bothered about the business I could give her, or the \"Word of Mouth\". All she had was, why dont you come here? When I told her where I lived, she was like, \"For one, we dont divulge our concept/menu on the phone.....Anyways it is very far for you\". Some attitude for a person who has just started a business.
Worst customer service I have ever come across."}
{"text":"With regard to AMber W.'s points

1. I'm rating the food not the containers or the owners
2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself.
3. I'm not downgrading it because it's not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or \"fast food\" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. I've eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this.
4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. It's not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners.
5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here."}
{"text":"I had a chat with the owners when I walked in here one day with a friend. They're very friendly and I wish them the best. Unfortunately, they'll need more than just my wishes because this endeavor of theirs is not going to work. The food is sub-par. The venue is some sort of an attempt at the fast food concept, except with none of the conveniences that actually come with fast food. There's no desire to drive to this place to sit down and eat. Which leaves only the desire to drive there, pick up food, and leave, if the food was delicious. But the food, again, is sub-par. Sadly, I cannot reward such poor execution with anything more than one star."}
{"text":"I highly enjoy this place and my husband and I have been back many times since our first visit. I very much enjoy the food and the owners are so friendly and really go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.

I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion, so for those that did not enjoy this place your opinion is valid, but I don't understand how you had such a horrible experience. I also don't understand why the reviews had to be so nit pickey. 

For the reviewer that nit picked about the tables and chairs, big deal! Shouldn't you focus on the food and not the decor? I know I go to a restaurant for food not decor. 

I think the same reviewer remarked that the veggies are frozen, quiet the opposite. The owners pride themselves on the freshness of their food. 

Having spoken to the owners I think they know how to run a business and if more people give them a chance I think they will suceed and they are listening to these Yelp reviews and taking what we say about them into consideration, which is more than I can say for most restaurant owners in this town who don't seem to care a whole lot what their patrons say.

I know not everyone will have the same experience, but I can say that I like this place and it's just too bad the other reviewers didn't enjoy what Curry Leaf has to offer."}
{"text":"Total sux ass! What a disappointment. 

We found out that a new Indian place openning up near by and wanted to go check it out. Came once and they were closed. Came again and they were closed. But finally today we found place open. Ordered some stuff, got some boxes took them home (Its really not an eat in kinda place unless you like dinky tables and Walmart plastic chairs.) 
Ohh boy! Ohh boy! Ohh wait! Rice? WTF! Its just a bowl of rice with some very little \"Stuff\" on top of it. WOW Are those vegetables from frozen pack, cuz it sure looks like it. Tastes like it too. 
So, i just paid 15 bux for 2 small bowls of rice with some questionable chicken and some frozen veggies that tasted like fast food Indian. 

Damn i feel violated."}
{"text":"Am a big Indian food connoisseur. I am always on the hunt for Indian food in Phoenix and it is too disappointing that no restaurants so far has met my expectations. Unlike Seattle, where my brother lives, good quality Indian food is hard to come by here in Phoenix. I have read the reviews on yelp and none of it seem to have presented the good and the bad that can provide a feedback to the people running this business. With that in mind, I want to visit this restaurant and will be posting an opinion soon so other yelpers can get a good input."}
{"text":"It's interesting seeing some of the reviews on here. You would think Curry Leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale Indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area. 

Curry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery. 

Jeff P mentions \"It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food\" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? 

Curry Leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out \"Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?\" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days. 

I ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). 

There are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer. 

The bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value. 

In a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!"}
