{"text":"I read a description of Sutter's as \"a diamond in the rough\".  I couldn't agree more.

For most Clevelanders, Sutter's is not conveniently located. Several years ago they were originally located on E. 140th Street in Cleveland. They closed for a few years and reopened in Newbury - way out in the deep, dark depths of Geauga county. You will not regret taking the drive to eat here, that is, if you're willing to eat veal. My parents have been regulars at this restaurant for nearly 30 years. They were really sad when the original location closed. My dad thinks he's cool because he can walk back into the kitchen and talk to John (owner and chef) and buy him a drink while he cooks.


The menu consists mostly of veal dishes and some really great appetizers. Steamed mussels in a tomato sauce, giant stuffed mushrooms, sauerkraut meatballs. The mussels are a must try. My brother took a mussel shell and actually drank some of the sauce they were prepared in. We are a classy family.

I am not afraid to say that Sutter's serves the best schnitzel and scallopini dishes you will find in northeast Ohio, period.  The potato pancakes are to die for. I went last night with a party of 12 REALLY LOUD Italian people. When our entrees arrived there was complete silence - we were all eating and could not be bothered to speak. There was an occasional \"nom\" here and there. 

If you're not into veal (I understand, I refused to eat it for years), they offer a few fish dishes, pasta, and chicken. 

The portions are seriously huge. If you are like me, you will eat maybe 1/4 of your entree. You will leave with leftovers and they will be just as delicious tomorrow. 

If you're planning a visit to Sutter's on the weekend, I would suggest making a reservation. 

Also, sadly there was talk last night of the owners wanting to retire so they may not be around much longer."}
{"text":"CLOSED.  And wow... we were SOOOooo looking forward to our next meal here.  We last partook in their famous moist and delicious weinersnitchel in 2009 or 2010 and were instantly hooked.  However, our craving for the delicious yet sinful dish never seemed to coincide with their operating hours of 5 and 9 p.m. Tues thru Saturday.  Apparently we only get hungry in mid-afternoons, around midnight, or 20+ miles away from Newbury Township!  But we always had their sauerkraut meatballs and veal drawing us in with \"recent\" Yelp reviews to keep rekindling and affirming that desire! 

Everytime we stopped by it was either the wrong day or wrong hours.  We finally got our act together (nearly 5 years later!) and made a concerted effort to visit within that window of business hours.  However, to our complete chagrin, found the place closed.  No signs on the front, fallen-over plants on the porch, and papered-up windows.  Although the side and back windows revealed an empty beer bottle on a counter and lots of pots and pans piled up in the kitchen, the place had a definite air of desertion, not vacation. 

Browsed for info online - no site, no news, nothing further.  So I checked with the township and, sure enough, they confirmed the owners retired this year (2014) and no one (as of 5/21/14) has taken over the business.  Bummer...!

So... 5 stars based on our last (and apparently final) experience with northeast Ohio's best weinersnitchel. :("}
{"text":"German food + Italian Food=  Axis of  Veal?

We were driving around after the Burton Antiques festival looking for a place to eat that was not faux Amish.  I just did not feel like the scent of overcooked pot roast mingling with the acrid waft of geriatrics.  So we Yelped it.  Surely the Amish were not positing fake reviews, right?

No indeed.  To my rescue came my beloved fellow Yelper Stefanie C., who gave this place glowing reviews.  Sold.

At first the prices seemed a bit high for a kitchy old place.  However, if you figure that each meal is the size of a huge dinner, lunch the next day, and some leftovers afterwards, it's a rare bargain.  They serve perfectly prepared slabs of veal the size of the Sunday NY Times-- before you do the puzzle.

Half the menu is Italian themed and the other half is Greman themed.  Schnitzel and scallopini.  All veal, all the time.  I quit my liberal bleeding heart bellyaching when I tasted my scallopini.  For a meal like that, I'll bear a little guilt.  My husband went Teutonic and had Schnitzel with ham and cheese.  Mein Gott im Himmel!  It was fan-wunderbar-tastic.

Try the insanely gigantic sauerkraut meatballs.  Quit whining, you big girl's blouse.  There is only a hint of sauerkraut in the giagantic, tender, battered, deep fried meatballs.  Not enough to shock your tender palate.  Just enough to give it body and zing.

My only complaint-- lots of thick heavy cream sauce.  Never liked it.  I'm being a noodge, though.  Eat there."}
{"text":"oh geez, only one review of Sutter's and someone beat me to it! We too, have been going there for years. They have simplified things a bit over time, but their main deal, weiner schnitzel, is still absolute perfection. I really don't understand how he does it perfect every time, but I guess if you've been doing schnitzel every day for 30 years, you have it down. It's a very large, ok, HUGE, piece of very tender veal pounded thin, battered or coated somehow, and fried to crispy, greaseless perfection. You get 2 of these huge delicacies, and I should only eat 1/2 of one, but I always eat a whole one and take the other one home. If you put it on a pie plate and stick it in the oven, it crisps up again nicely the next day. 

The whole dinner, including a large, and always crisp and completely fresh salad, side of pasta or potato or veggie, is only like $16 or something ridiculously cheap, especially considering the size of portion and the perfection of the wiener schnitzel. I seriously doubt you will ever get such a perfectly done schnitzel anywhere in the world, actually. This guy is the master of weiner schnitzel and you should sample the best. You can get fancy schnitzels with different sauces and cheese and whatnot on it, but I always get the plain and squeeze a bit of fresh lemon over it. I don't like the sauce to make the crunchy perfection soggy. I eat the edges first and then eat the middle part :-)

There is a bar which is always empty now, which, pre-recession, was always full of people waiting for a table. The place is in a house-like building. It's pleasant, clean, homey, and very comfortable and family-feeling. If you live on the far east side, definitely give it a try. If you are a schnitzel lover, or a veal parmesean lover, it's a MUST!

I have to admit, the schnitzel is the only thing I've ever had there. You must know that I'm a person who always likes to try something new and different. This is the only place I've ever gone where I get the exact same thing every time. In fact, every time, I study the menu and ponder the schnitzel varieties, the veal or chicken marsala, and other things to the point where I must have the menu memorized. But each and every time I end up with the plain schnitzel.

We went there just tonight and we did break out and order the saurkraut meatball appetizer, in addition to the plain schnitzel. There were 4 delicious GIANT meatballs laced with a hint of saurkraut, coated with the schnitzel batter and fried to the same greaseless perfection with a cream sauce over them.."}
