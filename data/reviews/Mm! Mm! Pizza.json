{"text":"We have ordered so many times from MM MM pizza.  The food is good and the service is usually good...until tonight.  Apparently, the person taking my order neglected to write down my phone number.  Consequently, I did not receive any order.  When I called to inquire regarding same, I asked for a manager.  \"Ryan\" (manager???)  hung up on me.  Fortunately, I called back and spoke with Dale who delivered an order to me at no charge.  My advice, if \"Ryan\" is working...don't order!  As we feel no business should tolerate \"Ryan's\" behavior, we rate 1 star."}
{"text":"Mm Mm pizza is my favorite pizza in the Pittsburgh area.  The sauce is outstanding.  It is full of rich tomato flavor with just the right spices.  I always ask them to put extra sauce on my pizza when I order.  I usually stay pretty basic with my pizza with one topping or just a cheese pizza.  They always have a variety of coupons available and daily specials.  The carry out only establishment just added hoagies to their menu which I plan to try in the future.  The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Delivery was prompt, and the pizza was generously topped, with a perfectly crusty-yet-chewy crust and just the right amount of sauce.  The dough was a tad on the bland side."}
{"text":"I swear this place improved substantially in the 13 years since I first had it. It's AWESOME.  I love the crust, sauce, and fresh ingredients.  The traditional pizza is worth 5 stars by itself, but the specialty pizza (I recommend Philly Cheese Steak) is tremendous, the steak salad top notch, and the hoagies and gyros are second to none.  Always excellent service here as well. So glad I gave this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza place in Peters Township! There are a lot of new pizza options in the area, but Mm Mm's is still my favorite. Tasty sauce, crust, and just the right amount of toppings. Delivery is always on time and reliable. Great delivery pizza shop."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Thai chili wing sauce is good! If you prefer your wings a little more crispy like me then make sure you ask"}
{"text":"I don't like the pizza here. At all. The rest of the food is pretty average but the delivery guys are nice and fast. If it's the only plce open or that will deliver to your crib, it'll do, but it ain't no Fiori's that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great smelling and tasting! I am not a pizza fan! In fact I usually opt out of pizza when that's what's available! However this place had the best tasting sauce combined with the cheese and pepperoni, the taste was just right. Not too sweet, not too salty and the dough was just the right texture!! The wing dings were super tasty too! Not too oily and the crisp and crunch of the batter made the wings fun to eat!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering here. I was excited that this place delivered to my work! We ordered a medium pizza and tossed salad. The order came way faster then we were told which was a huge plus. The salad was huge. Not the biggest fan of iceberg lettuce but none the less, huge and filling for the price. The pizza was ok. Nothing close to my usual place, but good. I would order again."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Awesome service. These guys have been dominating the south hills for a decade. There is no better pizza joint for delivery in the area. Love mmmmm pizza. Try the Thai Chili Wings.. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, pizza was just ok.  The large seemed pretty small compared to others."}
