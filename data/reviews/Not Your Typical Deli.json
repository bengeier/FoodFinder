{"text":"Great service, with excellent sandwiches.  The Cuban was fantastic!  We stopped for a quick lunch and were very pleased.  The owner stopped at our table and informed us of the cause his deli supports. Amazing to see good people doing great things.  Plus the meats are all cured in-house."}
{"text":"I don't live in Gilbert but My friend and I were out there freelancing for a wedding. I used yelp to help me figure out where we should eat. Well, yes, I decided to go here because of its five stars. I ordered the Mac and cheese dog with a club sandwich. Everything was fresh and super delish. I will definitely be back! Staff were Super friendly too especially the guy who wears the bow tie! Super outgoing and friendly.  -mahalo"}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had in my life. Wife had the meatball sandwich which was phenomenal as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried NYTD today for lunch with some co-workers and we are all hooked! I had the spaghetti sandwich- the sauce was home made, the pasta cooked perfectly, AND it was topped with the most delicious pesto cream. Not only is the food great, the staff was so friendly and attentive. The owner was very sweet and told us that most of the staff he hires are autistic. I was so impressed with the food and staff that I'm making this my go-to sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Wanted to patronize this local deli, so I was there Friday at noon . I asked for a pastrami sandwich to be told that it is still in the oven and not ready, so looked up the menu, and decided on the Ruben, to be told again that the corn beef was not the available.  Not your typical deli is correct, too bad"}
{"text":"Autism guy Sam met us and greeting. We are pleased he learned some fingerspellings to us we are deaf.  The food are absolute good  I recommend you go this place and cool place.  We're proud of Sam. I would come back again"}
{"text":"I came into this place to support their awesome philosophy and business plan, I went away even more impressed with the amazing food! I was expecting Subway quality, but now shudder at the comparison. The sandwiches are just out of this world. They pile quality meats on wonderful breads in sandwiches that are too big for one sitting. I save the rest for another meal and do not share a bite.  Please do yourself a favor and try the meatball sandwich and a cookie. Love this place and its mission!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, the cause even better.    I always get the turkey pesto on wheat."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for a turkey sandwich this afternoon.  They had a pesto one - but I just wanted a plain turkey sandwich. The young man behind the counter had no problem with that - or with substituting the pesto for something else.  And then when I finally got home and took the sandwich out of the bag and unwrapped it - I saw that it was a very big sandwich! Great price for the size!  I ate it for both lunch and dinner!  I have to say - it was probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I absolutely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully great sandwiches. The owner came out and talked to us for a nice personal touch. Talked about his motivation for the restaurant - employing autistic and learning disabilities. Come the first time to support the cause , you'll come back cause it's a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"My first Pastrami Sandwich ever. then next time I went I tried the Reuben,  YUMMY  my friend had the Chicago Dog,  i would actually eat a hot dog if it looked like that.   I learned the chef cures his own meat. Wow.  They even have gluten free bread.   It's cute and very delicious, the staff, attends to your every need, and it is a great atmosphere, one of the employees even has his artwork on the walls.  It is a great place. Go and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Greeted at the door as we walked in was the beginning of our unique dining experience here. Personable, outgoing and enthusiastic greeter gave us information on dining options and specials.   We ordered the Italian beef with a side of au jus. The beef was succulent and tender with an excellent mix of spices. Combined with cheese and fresh,  soft bread on the inside and crunchy exterior creates an smorgasbord of flavors.  A Mexican coke and fresh baked chocolate chip cookie completed this phenomenal dining experience.  A must go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a must try!  Great ambiance and wonderful food.  They take a great deal of pride in their work and it shows.  Absolutely one of the best dogs I've had and well worth the price!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit it.  I thought that it was possible that all the 5-star reviews were more reflective of the altruistic nature of the company and their mission than of the food.  But holy guacamole - the food is AMAZING.  I had a mac & cheese dog and the hubby had the NYTD Cubano dog after a recommendation from Cordell.    My husband has high standards for food, so it's always a fun challenge for me to find amazing eateries when we travel.  I hit it out of the park with this one - he kept using the word \"phenomenal\" and said it got better with every bite.  The pulled pork was \"kissed\" with citrus and the pickles were just perfect.  Chef W even stopped by our table and confirmed that he painstakingly hand picked those pickles because they were the best.  If he's that dedicated to the pickles, you can bet your bottom dollar that the rest of the menu is top-notch.  If you didn't leave room for dessert, get a chocolate chip cookie to go.  At first glance they look like scones because they are just that big.  If you go to your grave without eating one of these cookies, you will regret it.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"So was out in Mesa for an errand and we find this place. Was an awesome choice to stop here. To start off the owners are super friendly. Really great people.   My fiance got the Cubano and I got.. Wait for it.. The spaghetti sandwich. First the Cubano was fantastic. The bread was crushing but not overly so. Pickles and mustard in every bite. My fiance, who used to live in Florida, says she's never had better on this side of the states.   As for the spaghetti sandwich, I ordered it on a wim, because it seemed like something you don't see on a menu at a sandwich shop. Little did I know this was a recipe that has been in the family for generations. An amazing sandwich. The bread was buttery and toasted. Gooey provolone cheese and a garlic aioli really brings the sandwich together.   And did mention everything is made in house?   They also had some huge chocolate chips cookies that were really great.   Definitely try this place out"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great sandwich! The baked goods were yummy! Loved the cherry chip cannoli! We shared a massive chocolate chip cookie, so delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in today for the first time after my mom recommended we go.  My husband ordered the Italian Press and I ordered the Pressed Italian Pork.  Both were two of the best sandwiches we have ever had.  I can't wait to go back and try everything!  The customer service was stellar - I believe it was Cordell who helped us - he was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is a really great sandwich place. Amazing service and great food. Came in cause I live so close and I saw the reviews and I am very happy I did. I picked up a N.Y.T. cubano, white BBQ pork, and an Italian dog. Every one was as delicious as the last. They are all about $10 each with chips and a pickle, which can be a lot but when the food is good it's worth the price. It's not 5 because I wanted to try the pastrami sandwich but they were out  I will be back to try it though soon!"}
{"text":"We heard about Not your typical deli and thought we'd give it a try to see what the fuss was about. We were greeted by amazing staff and the food was more than we had expected! Everything was perfect. We will be back  again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I love deli sandwiches and they did not disappoint. Looking forward to going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches on our first visit. Very family friendly, relaxing, calm atmosphere. Great service and tons of smiling faces. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Absolutely fabulous food and the service was fantastic. The guys working here are just the sweetest! I had the Turkey Pesto, hubby had the Italian, one kid had mac and cheese and the other had a hot dog. The turkey pesto was outstanding. The pesto aoili was spot on. And I'm picky about my aoli. All the ingredients were in the right proportion  and worked well together. If it wasn't such a drive to get there, I'd be here every day. The rest of the family had similar comments about their food.   Their business model is amazing and I commend them for it. Every person working there was great, and obviously really loved their job.   My only comment for improvement would be to add a soda machine with serve yourself drinks.   Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"The place is uberclean delightfully decorated with a light touch. The staff are super gracious. You get the feeling they actually want to talk with you. They are very accommodating about special requests. The food is delicious and an incredibly good buy. The Rubin sandwich I had was ginormous!  The corned beef (they roast their own) was lean, tender and tasty. They really pile the meat on those sandwiches. You get a lot for your money.  Go there. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I went here last week with my husband, mom, and kids. It was wonderful! Not only is it such a cute place but the friendly atmosphere makes it even better. The service was great and the food was delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service, the sandwiches and the concept is all fantastic.  Try the pastrami sandwich!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and great service.  Food was excellent and the portions huge.  I really only needed half of my meatloaf sandwich.  I will definitely go for lunch anytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"Was greeted in a prompt friendly manner by Cordell.  We ordered the turkey pesto and roast beef sandwiches on Italian rolls and split a side of cole slaw.   Our meal was delicious.  The coleslaw flavor stood out as it contained olives and a combination of spices that made it unique.  Not Your Typical Deli is a hidden gem that we will surely be frequenting in the future."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. One of the best Ruben sandwiches I have had. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. I would recommend this place it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had at a deli... a must go to!!"}
{"text":"Perfect Reuben. Melt in mouth pastrami. The kind of food you can't stop thinking about. Turkey pesto and pie was happiness to go. The staff were so fun. Took a bite of my sons Italian beef, never had better. Visited twice and will be back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the sandwiches at NYT Deli. The White BBQ Pork with coleslaw was excellent. Very friendly service and convenient to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Not only is the food absolutely delicious, every single person is so nice and friendly! Favorite dish: the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, super professional and friendly staff! My turkey pesto sandwich was awesome! Will definitely be back! Eating here will make your heart happy!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch!  This restaurant provides training to individuals with developmental disabilities. The food was delicious! My new favorite deli in Gilbert & everyone was full of smiles! It's a great concept- allowing people with special needs to work in the food industry the greeter, Sam made my day!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable place unbelievable food great home made pastrami white BBQ pulled pork is awe freaking some"}
{"text":"By far the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. My wife had the chicken salad sandwich which she could not finish. The woman that helped us gave me tips on how to eat the pastrami so the juice stays in the meat. She was spot on. You can tell they use nothing but premium ingredients and know how to put a sandwich together. We will definitely be back and will be spreading the word."}
{"text":"LOVE NYT Deli. Cordell (look for the guy with a smile and bow tie) is so friendly and makes you feel welcome.  We did arrive around 8:30pm on Saturday night so it was late but I was so sad that they were out of Chocolate Chip Cookies  I always get the hot roast beef and my son wanted to try the meatball sub. Unfortunately, they were out of marinara sauce so my son decided on the Mac n cheese hot dog. Really, did I read that menu item correctly? Apparently I did because this massive hot dog with Mac. N cheese and bacon arrived minutes later. My son LOVED it!!! After every bite he was deciding what day he would come back to try the other hot dog flavors.   Keep doing what you are doing and we will keep coming back and bring all our friends. My dad is coming in from the east coast soon and this is where I'm taking him when he gets off the plane."}
{"text":"My wife, kids, and I ate here the other day. We were in the area for a few days and we relied on Yelp to find us a great luncheon spot. This deli came up as highly rated and nearby, so we gave it a shot. The food was excellent. My son had the mac n cheese, which was extremely thick/cheesy and he couldn't finish. The sandwiches were served with a small bag of snack size chips, which could have been better as the food is a bit on the pricey side for lunch in a small establishment like this. It was around $10 for a sandwich, which did not include a soda or other drink.The price would be my only criticism, but none of us left hungry. We grabbed a few of their huge chocolate chip cookies on the way out to take with us - they were excellent. It was only during the meal that we read on the menu about the company's integration of some staff with disabilities, and this made us feel great about choosing to eat there. The service was as good or better than anywhere else we ate during our stay in AZ. If we're ever back in the area, we plan to come back in again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place since Ive seen it, finally tried it and I have to say, it is the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had (definitely recommend it) they have very non-typical sandwich selection. I've went back since and tried a couple more things on the menu and everything is Delicious. I've met with the owner and his beautiful wife, who by the way makes the Cubans from scratch. They are such nice people, who put some much in to making a interesting menu. Always make sure and ask about there specials of the day because it's always something interesting that you should try. And make sure to save room for dessert because the bakery in shop make some of the most picutluar creations and are so crazy you have to try and they are so good everything That I've tried definitely recommend stoping by and trying don't know what you are missing out on."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! The staff is so friendly and you are treated like family from the minute you walk in the door. The food is absolutely delicious and the portions are gigantic! Well worth it and we will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get treated to a staff lunch brought in from here today. I haven't been there yet but our lunch was delicious!! Everyone was raving about their meals. I had a salad which had a generous scoop of chicken salad on it - delicious!!! The meatball sandwiches looked amazing!!  Truly Not Your Typical Deli!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely place and people with caring ethos. Sandwiches hot and cold and many yummy deserts. A little pricey but great for a friendly meal."}
{"text":"Everything everyone has said about this place is right on. More than excellent service, wonderful atmosphere and the food is delicious. Cordell, one of the gentlemen who works there is a doll and unbelievably good at his job. He was so full of energy and kindness, I would go back just to talk to him and see what color bow tie he's wearing! Each person who helped us was informative and really seemed to enjoy their job. The food is all made in house and the taste is exceptional. We stopped and got a snickerdoodle cookie that was amazing. Portions are huge and appropriately priced :) we will 110% be back again."}
{"text":"Such an amazing group of people that have such love and passion for food! Chef W is throws down deli food like it's suppose to be. There is so much passion and thought that goes into his food!  Chef will roast, brine and cure their own meats! Amazing!  Chef W brought out the most amazing Mortadella sandwich I've ever had! Wow! Wow! We've also experienced the Spaghetti Sandwich and Cubano and they both are something special!  Also, make sure don't leave without having one of \"Grandma's Chocolate Chip Cookies\".   My next try will be their famous Beef sandwich.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I love that they help persons with disabilities...we walked in and were greeted by a handshake from Sam..so sweet.    I ordered a tuna melt and husband ordered a club sandwich.  Mine was supposed to be hot but tuna was cold and bread not toasted.  Told a young server and after a few try's they served a nice salad with a scoop of tuna.  It was delicious!  Husbands club was filled with fresh cold cuts and even crisp bacon.  He loved it and could only eat half.  Restaurant is very clean with pleasant pictures on the wall painted by the greeter Sam!    Would definitely recommend it----we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back! I was already blown away by the perfectly toasted bun on the NYT Cubano but the attentiveness you get from the staff was warming. They're genuinely interested in your experience. The owner stopped by and said hello. He explained the mission behind the restaurant which employees individuals with disabilities. Great sandwiches, great service and great mission NYT Deli! My day is complete"}
{"text":"Seriously Delicious. Was super impressed with the the service. I truely enjoyed the NYTD, just the right amount of meat, pickles, and mustard. The bread was amazing. Was a good sized sandwich but wasn't overly stuffed with ingredients (I hate it when you can't fit your mouth around the damned sandwich!!)  Definietly plan on going back, this place has earned its 5/5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"The name says it all. This is definitely not your typical deli. The sandwiches and soups are absolutely wonderful, tasty and filling. You do not leave the least bit hungry. Their house cured corned beef and pastrami are the best I ever had. The tuna is just like the rest of the menu, delish. If you go there once, you will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I have tried several items on their menu and I have liked each one. Great chocolate chip cookies and great service."}
{"text":"One of the best deli's in town. Chef W makes everything from scratch. Cubano and Chicago Beef sandwiches are my favorites and I suggest trying all the sides if you're in a group or just yourself and bring some home. And, aside from being a truly great deli, is it's mission is one of the best there is. Keep up the great work Chef W, Sam and every at NYT Deli."}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich ever! Wife had tuna sandwich and we shared the strawberry cake for dessert.  Fantastic.  The staff were friendly and helpful to a fault.  Outstanding service.  If you are nearby, just go.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow.  Came in with high 5 star expectations from yelp and a lot of hype.  Had been waiting to go here for a while but never got around to it.  Expectations blown out of the water.    Atmosphere: cute old school comfort based old timey feel, order at counter and grab a seat at table cloth table with flowers in mason jar.  Service: immediately greeted and cashier explained the detail they go into in every sandwich and that they house make all their meats.  Amazingly friendly!  Food: It was very busy when I came in but my food came out fast.  I ordered the Italian Beef...again scared of my high expectations and hype.  The sandwich was AMAZING, the slow roasted beef was so flavorful and juicy, the giardiniera added the perfect flavor and the melted provolone was so good!   Nothing even comes close in the East Valley.  Cannot wait to come back and try everything else here.  Not often something can exceed my own hype...but wow...hype exceeded."}
{"text":"We found this deli searching in Yelp and it had 5 Stars so we had to try it!  Unfortunately it is in a complex with a Fry's that is completely desolate.  But I was pleasantly surprised at how busy it was which was great to see.  My husband and I both had salads which were very big helpings and delicious!  The owner also was present and stopped by our table to check on us."}
{"text":"Great selection of custom sandwiches, hotdogs and salads.....made from scratch.  Everything is made in house and prepared fresh to order.  The staff member who greeted us \"Cordell\" was very nice and informative to us especially since it was our first time here.  He had a great positive energy, which is nice to see in the customer service industry.  I had the Cubano sandwich and my friend had the Reuben and both were delicious.  Great portions as well..we both were pleasantly full.  The atmosphere has a very small town diner atmosphere, which I love.  It definitely was a great find.  Please give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is legit. The wife and I got the Pastrami sandwich and the Rueben and holy crap it did not disappoint what so ever. The meat was so tender and falling apart, the flavor was on point, the sauerkraut was amazing. So the food was fantastic and lets not forget the service either. The employees were so nice and helpful. Will definitely be making this a bi weekly stop and bringing the fam."}
{"text":"Learned about it from the reviews, wanted to check it out because of the autism concept and will definitely be back for the food!  The staff were awesome and welcoming and I decided to set the bar high by ordering an Italian Beef (I'm from Chicago).  My wife ordered the pulled pork with white BBQ sauce.  Both were so good we traded halves of our sandwiches with each other!  I overheard the owner mention that they cure their own meats and the giardiniera is imported, not the store bought kind - and I could tell!  The bread was also excellent - this place cares about their ingredients and the sandwiches are hearty.  So awesome to see a business with a not only humanitarian purpose, but an excellent product!"}
{"text":"Fantastic idea, happy to support local business. Everything I've had there has been fantastic and the cookies are amazing!! There is a white bbq sandwich that is super good! Big portions, can definitely share or get a second meal.  Staff is very helpful. Love their new location, it's a lot bigger than the last one."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  The bread was AMAZINGLY fresh and both of our sandwiches were delicious!  Pasta salad was delicious.  French onion soup was some of the best we have ever had. LOVED the chocolate chip cookies too!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT people & food!  Thank you for a memorable experience. I will return soon with more friends. Keep up the great service."}
{"text":"They don't have 5 star's out of 5 star's for nothing! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !! Get their Chocolate chip cookie (that is if they haven't run out) the BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE I'VE EVER ATE!!  In house made deli meat & work opportunities for the autistic .. it's a win-win..."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place.  The food was great, service was great and the atmosphere was relaxed.  The cookies are to die for ... we split a salad and a sandwich.  Both were very tasty.  Only issue was finding the place, they only had a small a-frame sign out when we went.  But it was worth searching out."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when it was at its first location. We visited the new location on Friday and all I can say is WOW, just WOW. The staff is great, the food is delicious and I absolutely love the concept of employing persons with disabilities. I would love to bring this concept home with me to Tucson. Keep up the great work and keep on making delicious food!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this spot! Decided to try it for lunch based of of excellent Yelp reviews- and I love a small business with a cause! I was not disappointed. Prices are very fair, food is great, and the whole staff was extremely kind and went out of their way to help me and every customer in the place. Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and I'll hit his place up everytime I'm in town. Cuban sandwhich was outstanding. Paired really well with the vanilla cream soda. Almost had the cookie but hey we're huge!! Staff were awesome as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The pastrami cured in house is probably the best I've ever had.   The sandwiches are huge, and so are the delicious chocolate chip cookies.  The employees are super nice as well."}
{"text":"I was greeted the second I walked in. They seemed genuinely happy that I was there. The guy got everyone's order right (which for some reason is hard to come by these days).  I don't like buying my drink by the can, but that's not a big deal.  The sandwiches on the menu were separated by cold/ and hot sandwiches, but I ordered a cold one and asked to have it put on the panini press and it was no problem.  The food came out relatively quick.  About half way through the meal a lady that worked there came and talked to us for a few mins. She was warm, nice, and easy to have a conversation with.  It was charming that most people that worked there were related.  I would recommend going here if you like a good sandwich.  Also, I didn't have a salad, but I saw one at the table next to us, and it was freaking HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. And a admirable business philosophy that includes employees many employees who are in the Autism spectrum.  I loved everything about my experience and will be back and bring new friends each time!"}
{"text":"I took a group of six for lunch; everyone in the group gave two thumbs up.  Food was great and the service was even better.  Only downside is their drink offering was limited."}
{"text":"We love this place! Not only does the comfort food take me back home to Cleveland but there is always something different on the menu.  They got me hooked on the meatloaf sandwich  (I hated meatloaf as a kid), then the Mac N Cheese Dog. Now I'm on to the meatball sub with this amazing touch of pesto drizzled on top.  Today I saw the infamous 3 way chili on the menu and even heard rumors of perogies in the future. Who could ask for more? The portions are huge!! I even bought my Cleveland stadium mustard here!!  Amazing food aside they have a really neat thing going here.  The group working and training here do such a great job. You can tell that the group in training really take pride in their work and want to be there.  This restaurant is truly making a difference in our community and giving these kids an opportunity they might not otherwise have. So when you visit, make sure to say hello to Sam (he will usually greet your table) and let the gentleman at the counter tell you all about the food because he knows what's up!! And enjoy your meal because I know you will!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place! Sam, the young man the greets you at the door is so pleasant and sweet. Love the Turkey Pesto sandwich. We've made this our weekly lunch place! Yummy a must try"}
{"text":"So, my fam moved from NYC to Arizona a few years ago, and I'm sad to admit that I may be a bit of a snob when it comes to deli sandwiches (at one time I worked minutes away from Katz deli). I can't eat a lot of meat, so when I choose to, I want it to be good. That's not too much to ask, is it? I'm also not a fan of dishing out $10 for a sandwich that has mass distributed deli meats and cheeses (yes, boar's head, I'm looking at you). After 4 years in AZ I've pretty much given up on finding a good deli spot.  So then... I come across a positive review from a friend and my curiosity rises... And I go with my kids and MIL to check it out.  On that first visit we ordered an N.Y.T. Cubano, a White BBQ pork, a kids Mac-n-cheese... Oh wait - then my 3 yr old decides he wants eggs... Really, kid? The staff, however, didn't seem phased... Everyone was super nice and accommodating. They modified his meal and gave him an egg salad sandwich. Everything was so good. The white BBQ pork is seriously the best meat sandwich I've ever had. But the Cubano was excellent also (not overpowering salty but superbly flavored). When the kids Mac first came out, I was surprised to see a very small bowl. But do not be misled by the small bowl, my fellow yelpers! When I dumped her Mac on a flat plate to cook it off, it filled up the whole plate and was way more Mac than I expected. Btw - it is delicious.  We came back a few days later with a larger crew (there were 10 of us this time), so we were able to sample a wider selection of their menu. Hubby & I got a White BBQ pork (because I've been craving it since that first visit) and a pastrami sandwich and split both half and half. We also brought our 23 months old this time and we felt like he wasn't going to eat a full meal's worth. So we got 2 Macs, and our 5 y.o., 3 y.o. & 23 mos old split it in 3. Again, no problem, the staff brought out 3 plates and there was still plenty of food. The other 2 options that were ordered that time were the Caprese sandwich & the meatball sub. I seriously don't like meatballs, so i haven't tried it personally but both people at our table who got it - loved it. It also happens to be greeter Sam's favorite sandwich. The caprese sandwich looked great and I might want to try it the next time I'm there.  And if that's not clear - all meats are made IN HOUSE!!!  Totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was confused at first when I walked in getting a handshake greeting and a menu a way to earn that name not your typical.... But I later learned from reading the menu that this place helps those with autism and everyone was super nice kind and positive and upbeat attitude.   Here comes the best part the food was amazing. I had a Reuben and it was just perfect. My wife had the pesto chicken and that was delicious too.  I'm ready to go back and try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Great deli good.   The service was great.    The pastrami was fantastic.    Someone in our group got a salad, it was huge, and very good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ambiance, service, and food are all perfect. We have wanted to come here for some time and finally made it. So glad we did! Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"OK so here is yet another example where fellow Yelpers led me to a place that is right next to my house yet something I would have never gone into.  NYTD us bad ass and the food there is everything people say it is.  Add in the family style business who is active in everything from bussing tables to checking in with customers.   My big tip is to get the Italian Beef sandwich. It was one of the best sandwiches I've had in many years.  The Cuban is also very good.  Great to have a place so close that gets it right."}
{"text":"First time for dinner serving seven. We ordered at the counter. Staff are real pros orderly, courteous, & friendly. The food is brought to the table. I had the pastami sandwich. It was fresh & more than enough in quanity. Everyone enjoyed their  meal. Ordered carrot cake from the bakery. Yummy. Would definity go back."}
{"text":"Great!! What an amazing little hideaway. Everything about this place is fantastic. We were greeted immediately upon entering. We ordered the NYT Cubano and the White BBQ sandwich. We got two sides, potato salad and pasta salad. The pasta salad is insanely good!!! I will be back just for that. Both sandwiches were delicious. Do yourself a favor and go here. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was based on the yelp reviews. It wasn't a busy lunch time and the restaurant was cool on a warm day. We were greeted in a friendly warm and professional manner. We placed our orders at the counter and were given a number to be placed on our chosen table, where our lunch would be delivered.  Nice jazz music played in the background while the host took turns mingling with the guests... making sure everyone was happy and back to the counter to greet new customers. The lunch was delivered fresh and warm. We both ordered Reuben sandwiches. Mine was lightly toasted and became soggy quickly on one side. My guest felt that it needed more cheese and we both felt that the homemade thousand Island was watery. Drinks were in cans... over ice would have been preferred. Sandwiches were served with a bag of standard Lays potato chips and a kosher pickle spear. We also ordered pasta salad. It came very untraditionally prepared with elbow macaroni which was not quite to the al dente stage. Immediately the flavor of gardiniera came through and while popular, was not to my liking. The hosts were distracted by a larger table of friends to be concerned, but made a cursory attempt to almost make amends to correct before turning around to their friends.  I like the folks and will return.  My 80 year old companion would not.  She thought the hard chairs were miserable, while I would normally have that complaint, I did not.  The atmosphere was charming.  I want to try their Cubano dog at minimum.  Everyone has an off day.  I'm glad they have friends. I'm sure they make them daily with their warm and congenial manner.  Worth a visit.  They have a noble and heartwarming mission."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful. I ordered the meatball sub and a chocolate chip cookie...because how could I turn down a cookie that was pretty much screaming my name?! I also ordered a mini snicker doodle and apple pie to take to my son and his gf. The food was soooo good!! In all honesty, even if the food wasn't great, the incredibly friendly service would have made up for it. The owner and staff were so welcoming and the atmosphere is cute and relaxing! I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Glad I found their new location after they moved. Sandwiches are great and they now are colocated with a sweets bakery. Huge cookies, pies, cakes. Like the pastrami. Having a lemon bar for dessert tonight. Going to try the Cuban on my next visit. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Even with GPS, this place may be a little hard to find, if you haven't been there before. But it is worth the search. It is just east of the Fry's Food store about 100 yards. It is not pretentious or fancy, but it is very clean, with a quiet atmosphere, (although it can get busy).  The name \"Not Your Typical Deli\" is appropriate. Everything is fresh made and it is evident that whoever created the combinations of breads, meats and toppings, knew exactly what they were doing to create such a great tasting group of sandwiches and salads. The employees are amazing and offer great service. It is easy to see that everyone cares about the job they do.  I ordered the Egg Salad Sandwich and the Rueben, (I ate half of each and took the other half home for the next meal), while my wife had the NYT Cubano.  All three were generous portions, made with fresh bread, fresh toppings, and quality meats and other ingredients. Just a great sandwich. This was our first time there, and we are definitely going back to try more things on the menu. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, I will be back again. I had the Italian press which had the perfect amount of heat"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic sandwich.  Pastrami is like being back in NYC.   Roast beef perfectly cooked on anothe sandwich. Excellent service by the staff.Will return again.  I drive 25 miles for this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a new spot for us. A little off the beaten path and hard to find but well worth the hunt. We will be back! Friendly courteous help too."}
{"text":"Such good food and great hospitality. Perfect for that Sunday brunch!  They have a small menu, easy to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food and somewhere we like to eat at before seeing a movie next store.  The cubano sandwich is great and so are their salads.  The staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing--we go here all the time.  The staff is incredible--so well trained and always friendly and helpful.  As the mom of a son with autism, the cause is inspiring.  You won't be disappointed in trying this place out!"}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT your typical deli. It's way better. I came for lunch for the first time today, and I can't wait to come back. It's tucked back in a plaza, so it's a little tricky to find, but totally worth it.   Immediately on walking in I was sold. The two employees that were sitting outside got up and opened the door for me, and the two behind the counter were so sweet and helpful. And there was Sinatra playing, and fresh flowers.... perfect.   They make everything in house, down to roasting their own deli meat! It totally paid off. Best roast beef I've ever had.   I ordered the Italian Beef and a rootbeer cream soda. So delicious, both of them. I'm craving another cream soda as I'm writing this. (Something that seemed strange to me was that they serve a bag of lays with the sandwiches, which is very not homemade, but still fine with me nonetheless.)   But what has me wanting to come back is the spaghetti sandwich on garlic bread.   Definitely check this place out. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Hidden jewel! What a great spot! Plenty of seating, a host that was cheerful and helpful, and tasteful food. We ate in and our drinks were refilled before they were empty.   Both sandwiches were tasty, fresh, and unique. Glad to have found this place on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place was awesome!! I ordered the Rueben and it was the best I have ever had ..  not to mention they are doing a great thing by helping special needs people !! Love it !!"}
{"text":"Owner was beyond awesome. Came around and suggested menu items and told us their mission. Even gave us some free dessert. Food beyond awesome.  My new go to spot. Reminds me of back home. #supportlocal"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of the best sandwiches I have had in a long long time. Meat stacked high and so filling but couldn't stop eating it. Great place and will keep going l."}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting extended family here in AZ (We are from Utah).  We were in the area and Yelped a place to eat close by. Ran across this wonderful establishment. I had the White BBQ pork without bread, it came with coleslaw that was so yummy. Mom got the Reuben sandwich  that was awesome  (she let me have a bite). Totally recommend this place. Snikerdoodle was to die for, so soft. Wish we had a place like this in Utah County."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really like no other! Not only will you get amazing food, you'll get the best service you will ever get! The food is outstanding! Probably one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very nice down-home feel in the restaurant. The food is delicious. I love the pulled pork sandwich it is to die for. I really appreciate the fact that they employ people with some disabilities. Please give this place a try for lunch it is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I got a customized sandwich and they made it to the T. The owner is super friendly and very informative. Overall great place, eat here and review. Most of the employees are autistic and are getting such an incredible opportunity in this great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I typically don't write a review after only one visit but as the name suggests Not Your Typical Deli is just that and so much more. NYT offers their new employees a 12 week training course and it doesn't end there they provide continuous mentoring a hand up not a hand out for adults and students with Developmental Disabilities and Autism.  The Deli is light and bright filled with smiles ,real flowers on the table, fun décor, and colorful art work on the wall made by one of their young talented employees.  The friendly cashier with the bow tie ( because everyone knows bow ties are cool) took our order. We were even greeted by the owner and a chef as they were out and about checking on the steady flow of customers.  We ordered the Turkey Pesto, Rueben and the NYT Cubano, each comes with a bag of chips, were good size and definitely had great flavor. Somehow one of the cookies did not get ordered or delivered and they were out of pepper jack cheese but why sweat the small stuff besides the cookie was big enough to share! They only have canned sodas and perhaps a few bottled beverages and the prices might seem a bit high to some but what you get in return is not only good food it's knowing this place provides hope to it's employees and a service to the community that is absolutely priceless! \"Surround yourself with people who make you hungry for Life, touch your Heart, and nourish your Soul!\"  Author Unknown..."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem. There's no fancy signs or anything that grabs your attention to come in, but do yourself a favor and stop by. Fantastic customer service, good food and their chocolate chip cookies ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!"}
{"text":"Ah maZing sandwiches. Love this place. Friendly staff. Delicious food. Love love love."}
{"text":"Great food and service, cute decor, definitely worth a trip out. My husband's Cuban sandwich was just what we are used to from northeast delis. My salad was so big it could have served 3 people and ingredients were fresh. My little guy had the kids hot dog and again they didn't skimp on portion size, really nice bun and grilled sliced hot dog with chips and a juice box, toddler heaven."}
{"text":"The general experience here was wonderful. The staff were very friendly, the restaurant was clean, the food delicious, and the service was fast.   We sampled too many things   The coconut cream pie, and the pear raspberry almond pie were super yum! We couldn't wait and ate them both before  our lunch arrived.   We sampled both the pastrami sandwich and the Italian pressed sandwich. Both so very flavorful with plenty of meat.   The only thing we weren't so thrilled about was the mac and cheese. We ordered a side just to see if it was any good. While the overall flavor was good and the pasta was al dente... The sauce was too runny, and one of those sauces that seemed like it was made with Velveeta. I was hoping for a quality homemade cheesey one. I won't order it again, but the rest of the food was great and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, welcoming, and attentive. We were informed that the family owned deli supports individuals with developmental disabilities, and 80% of the staff have disabilities. I ordered the Italian Salad. It was huge! The meat, prepared in house, was so flavorful, I couldn't stop eating until I had eaten the last bite. My boyfriend had the Spaghetti Sandwich. He described it as a tasty and comforting dish that is both unique and traditional. We can't wait to return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pastrami in AZ. If you've never been to a quality New York delicatessen, or even if you have. Be ready for an incredible sandwich.  Turkey Pesto, Roast Beef, and Club are also great. The meatball sandwhich is a bit too salty in my opinion."}
{"text":"The sandwich I got was really good, but it's incredibly pricey and for some reason they call hot paninis \"Cold Sandwiches.\" I mean, a hot turkey panini is also delicious and I ate it, but the hot panini was definitely listed under and ordered off of the \"cold sandwiches\" section of the menu.   So...very delicious but they seem to not understand that once a cold sandwich gets put onto a burning hot panini plate, it's no longer a cold sandwich. So just a heads up, if you order a cold sandwich because you want your sandwich to be cold, ask them to not make it a panini."}
{"text":"You have to try this very nice deli!  Lots of meat on The Italian sub and great potato salad and cole slaw.  What they are doing is something to be admired and complemented.  Will be back!  BTW get the giant chocolate chip cookie for dessert YUM"}
{"text":"I entered this establishment upon opening one weekend morning and the cashier did a fantastic job greeting me and explaining the menu.  I ordered a roast beef sandwich on white, a meatball sub on a roll and potato salad.  It was a mistake to order the white bread as it was simply a larger variety of a grocery store's white bread.  The roast beef and veggies on the sandwich were tasty and the meatball sub was fantastic.  The potato salad was the worst I have ever encountered and I even had two friends sample it who both spit it out.  The wait time was also excruciating.  People inside were joking that they must be slaughtering the animals in the back."}
{"text":"So, was down the road shopping and searched up local places to grab some grub. This place popped up with a high rating.   Decided to stop by with my oldest son and try some hot sandwiches.   I ordered a pastrami He ordered the NYT Cubano  Both of went with in house brewed iced tea.  The key points:  Service is excellent.   Sandwich combos include pickle drink and chips.   The place is comfy.   It did not take long for our food to be served.   The review:  My pastrami was ok. Nothing spectacular. But not horrible. I usually order a pastrami at new delis because they're hard to mess up.   The pickle was fresh and crisp.  It was just a bag of lays. The menu says deli style chips. No biggie. But some in house cooked chips would have been nice as that's what I was expecting.   The NYT Cubano was delicious.  Definitely something to write home about.   The cons:  It's expensive.   For 2 lunch combos. A pastrami sandwich and a Cubano with small ice teas. $28.   That alone is daunting. I don't know if I'll come back.   The portions aren't really large, which is fine if you consider it's a lunch deli. Just right size.  All in all, I might try another sandwich in the future if I'm down this way. But it'd be a solo trip because $30 for a couple sandwiches is a lot."}
{"text":"Great food great people!  Amazing concept...  Either the concept or the food could take the lead in this dance... It appears they both are fighting to be lead.  The service and smiles are a beam of light in a busy day... Showing what really matters in life.  The food is something you would expect in down town Cleveland or NY at an overpriced Restraunt.  The quality of ingredients and the skillfully thought out menu really bring the best to your taste buds.  Great job and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We were greeted by the owner who was quite friendly and he explained how they use fresh ingredients make everything from scratch and use a local bakery for their breads! Love that they employ around 23 autistic kids. Everyone was very friendly and we got our food quickly! I ordered the chicken salad chop which was huge and very good! My husband ordered the pressed Italian pork sandwich and subbed it on sourdough fantastic!! We had one of their famous huge and thick chocolate chip cookies it was wonderful! We will definitely be back! Great place!"}
{"text":"Hands down AMAZING! I discovered this place a year ago and can't believe it's taken me so long to leave a review. I love trying new places to eat that aren't your everyday chain restaurants and this blew me away! Me and my husband have loved every sandwich we've tried and every bite is full of flavor! You won't be disappointed! I can't remember the name of my favorite one but it's the French dip one, and I don't usually even like French dip. I would give them 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Food was terrific!  Can't say enough about this deli tucked away in Gilbert.  Please try it...you won't be disappointed.  The portions are extremely generous and food is really good.  Service is wonderful...I absolutely love that their employees are on the autism spectrum.  The employees are attentive and are there to make sure you are happy with your food.  Cordell helped us and was so helpful.  He walked us through the menu (it was our first time) and let us know the few items that were no longer available.  (we went very late one night after a movie).  The deli is extremely clean and organized.  I ordered the Reuben and I can't wait to go back and get another one.  My daughter ordered the meatball sub and had to take half of it with her.   It's a wonderful establishment...please support this local business."}
{"text":"Huge portions and such amazing sandwiches. Plus an incredible mission of hiring talented, kind people on the autism spectrum. We've had the Cuban, white BBQ pulled pork sandwich, turkey pesto, chicken salad, and Italian pressed. All were absolutely delicious and very fresh. Don't forget to grab a chocolate chip cookie for dessert. They are ginormous and out of this world!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sandwich shop.  My wife and i both had the Hot Ruben, I substituted Cole Slaw (with a white BBQ sauce dressing) for the Sauerkraut (no extra charge), and they were HUGE, and there was all 8 ounces of meat on them, just as advertised!  You will need the extra napkins they provide also.  As for the service, it was the best.  From ordering to departing the restaurant, the staff was very accommodating, friendly, courteous, and extremely efficient.  We were even approached, before our meals were served and asked if we thought we would be able to eat the entire sandwich, or would we like them to wrap half of it to take with us prior to them serving it.  We took them up on their offer!  The food here is great, and that's not all.  Take a look at their website (http://nytdeli.com) to see what they're all about.  We highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"WOW. This place is a somewhat hidden gem. The quality and quantity of the sandwiches is far beyond any deli or sandwich shop I've ever been to. Home made pastrami and corned beef, meatballs, meatloaf. You have got to try this place. Oh, and the best part is, they hire people with autism and give them a chance to excel when they are otherwise never given a chance. Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"In town looking for a house and heard about this place. Amazing sandwiches but a little hard to locate. It's all the way in the back end of the \"mall\" area near the Regal Cinema!"}
{"text":"So so so good. Best I have ever had.  Love the white BBQ sandwich. So fresh their meat are great.  Normally don't like Coke slaw on a sandwich almost ask for it off. So glad I didn't. It was so amazing.   Cookie to top off the meal was yummy.  I highly recommend this place.  And what a great cause.  Kids have special needs but they are so good you can't tell. They have given the kids such confidence.  Love love the place."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch! Superb service, delicious food!! Another customer convinced us to get the white bbq pork sandwich and OMG it was delicious! We also got the tuna sandwich on sourdough and a pecan sandie cookie. Wouldn't have changed a thing!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. This was our first time here. I decided to take my bf and friend for lunch based on all of the great reviews. Little hidden but so worth looking for. We were greeted by a really nice kid/ waiter who genuinely seemed like a happy person. Right away I felt like it was The right choice to come to this place. Myself and a friend had a Caprese sandwich and my bf had a Ruben. In one word: AMAZING! Really great sandwiches...these folks know what they are doing!!! Everything was paired really well and the food was practically melting in my mouth. My bf (normally a slowwwww eater) practically inhaled the sandwich. I was shocked...he stated he really like it.  The owner came out towards the end to tell us what they are all about and how they employ autistic kids and help them build their future!!!  God Bless You All for being so great!!!  We will be back for sure! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff was very friendly and attentive, our orders were delivered fast and accurate. The food was delicious with good portions and good prices, and the staff of all adults with developmental disabilities is so needed in our community, please go to this deli!!"}
{"text":"Just had the best pastrami sandwich ever.  Lean but moist..fresh rye bread..melted just right Swiss cheese.  They also have horseradish that I asked for on the side.  Sandwiches also come with pickle and bag of chips.  I was getting a little anxious as it took 29 minutes to get my one sandwich.  The sandwich was worth the wait...the chocolate chip cookie..oh my.  I will definitely be back...during the week...crowded on weekends as expected for this gem.  Located by the movie theaters so keep going to the back of complex and you will locate.  Can't wait to try other menu items but will be difficult to skip the pastrami..yum.."}
{"text":"Everyone was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and kind. I got the meatloaf sandwich and it was great! I can't wait to try more of their menu. The setting was a great place to eat and read my book. I'm more than happy to support an establishment that pumps out amazing food and supports a great cause! Definitely a great addition to our community!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  The food was tasty and filling and everyone who worked there were great! I loved the artwork on the walls as well and will be back!"}
{"text":"It has been quite some time since I thoroughly enjoyed a restaurant experience from the food to the staff. I cannot express enough how amazing this deli is. I ordered the Italian pork sandwich and was so impressed with the quality and flavor. ALL of the employees were extremely courteous. I love that chef w came out to ask how are experience was. I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant, everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food. The portions were humongous and everything tasted great. Hard to find location but well worth it.  My first time eating a Cuban sandwich and it was fantastic my wife had the club sandwich and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"One of the best delis I've ever been to. You really can't go wrong here. Just wish they were closer to me since I live in surprise."}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches, super friendly staff. This place is a little sandwich gem. We ordered three different sandwiches and each one was fantastic."}
{"text":"Finally Mesa has a good deli sandwhich shop ! First time there I ordered the Italian beef sandwhich which is made with their in-house roasted beef and au jus. Being a Chicago native I'm an Italian beef snob....this being stated, NYTD's Italian beef with giardiniera was AMAZING and their au jus perfectly rich. The only hesitation  from a 5 star rating is I did come across 3 bites with  inedible gristle and being winter in AZ, all delis should have a soup and/or chili option (which talking to the very helpful staff, may be added to the menu soon). I HIGHLY recommend NYTD to anyone looking for a REAL sandwhich and genuine deli food !"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time today. Were greeted at the front door with a \"what is your name hello\" welcome to our deli! Given menus and the waiter explained what was not listed on  the menu but was available and the beverages available. Nice selection of deli items I had the Italian Beef very good, crusty roll,  full flavored roast beef, mozz cheese and the Italian relish were great.  . Wife had the grilled Capresa with tomatoes, mozz cheese, pesto  was also very good. We will definitely be back!    Did not ask but \"soup\" I think might be a nice added item to the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend, how cute is this place!?  It is in an obscure strip mall -don't let that fool you.  The food was amazing, including the fresh baked deserts that are for display in their front case!  I had the meatball sandwich, A+ and a fresh backed Apple Pie Cookie -mind blown!!  The sandwich and cookie were both perfectly baked and had such amazing flavor.  If you happen to be in the area, make sure and stop here for a quick bite.  I will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"I love this place... I love all the workers and the food!  The people here are so cute and kind  You have to try the turkey sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"I decided it was way past time for me to try this place so my kids and I went for lunch and were very impressed! The warm friendly greeting when you first walk in, to the young man taking your order with his bowtie, to the chef coming by made us feel very welcome. Now the food, it was fantastic! Everything the 3 of us ordered was so delicious. Make sure you try one of their chocolate chip cookies which are large enough to share. Next time we go it will be all 4 of us including my husband."}
{"text":"My friends and I go to the Regal theater next door and walk past this deli each time. Unfortunately, it's usually closed, however, today it wasn't and boy were we surprised! The food is terrific, prices reasonable and Fernando, our waiter, was absolutely phenomenal! I ordered the NYT Cubano and my friend ordered the meatball sandwich. The Cubano was the perfect balance of pulled pork, ham, mustard and pickle. Nothing about the sandwich was overbearing as it can sometimes be when served elsewhere. The meatball sandwich as Rodney Allen Rippy used to say about the jumbo jack was \"too big a eat!\"  It came with three HUGE!! meatballs and smothered in cheese and marinara sauce. Because we were each jealous of the other's sandwich we ended up sharing. It was a gastronomical delight!  For dessert we had their chocolate chip cookie.  Just like the meatballs it was HUGE!!! and loaded with chocolate chips. My insulin will be working overtime on this one!    All in all it was a wonderful sandwich experience. One that we will return to on numerous occasions."}
{"text":"Thank you NYTD for bringing real quality deli foods to Gilbert! We finally went in today on a whim and were very pleasantly surprised. In house roasted meats, quality breads, homemade salads and baked goods - and perfect portion sizes! A lot of thought and love goes into each dish and it shows :) I can't wait to come back and work our way through the menu and fresh bakery!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It was amazing. The person working the front was super nice and friendly and made us feel welcome. I had the cubano and hubby had the pastrami. Cookies were excellent. Secret family recipe. They are moving soon to a new location at Gilbert and Warner (maybe Elliot) so check them out there if you can find them. Will have to come here again even though we live almost an hour away"}
{"text":"Great place great vibe amazing salad everything made fresh love this place Did I mention they have a spaghetti sandwich OMG so good"}
{"text":"Very yummy and fresh tasting. The cookie is awesome! I had the Cuban and my husband had the meatball sub with home-made meatballs."}
{"text":"Awesome little deli off the beaten path but amazing food! We had to try the Reuben, Cubano and Caprese grille cheese (this was a first time creation).. all the sandwiches were amazing! See pics... the service was fast and the place was busy. The owner cooks and his brother runs the counter.... Highly suggested!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Food was incredible, really fresh! Owner was there to greet and introduce himself. Really personable. I would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Everything here tastes great. The meatball sub is my favorite. I'm also glad for the addition of the One More Bite Bakery that was added. Their pies are AMAZING."}
{"text":"You come for the cause and you keeping coming back because the food is AMAZING!   I have yet to find something on the menu I don't like. I have to admit I had never had a Cuban sandwich before, I tried it and fell head over heals. I thought \"I'm missing out\" so I tried Cubans at several other restaurants and was not impressed, not even a little. If you like Cuban sandwiches you won't be disappointed! This is my go-to for sure. Something I never get tired of!  I also love the club, fresh,  HUGE and delicious!  What about the White BBQ? OMG! To die for.    It's exciting to bring people here and watch them fall in love.   Don't forget to be kind as 80% of the staff is on the spectrum.  Patients and kindness goes far.  You will feel like family! I hope you enjoy this deli as much as our family does!   The new location has allowed for some exciting new things! One More Bite Bakery has delicious goodies fresh everyday and Bergies Coffee Roasting!   These guys are AMAZING!  Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Great deli with the best chocolate chip cookies! Phenomenal service as well. Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"We love this place. I order lunch for the office on the regular! Such friendly workers and the food is amazing, always always get cookies!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot to get sandwiches at. The meat is made in-house, the bread is fresh, the food is just plain delicious. Today we ordered the Ruben and pastrami sandwich. We couldn't get enough, even my 9 month old son was obsessed. And their cookies, don't even get me started on how amazing they are. The service is wonderful, the food is delicious, just do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place! The service was friendly and fast. The food was fresh and very tasty!! I love that they support people with autism!!! Can't wait to come back and support this local business!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've lived close to this place for two years and today is my first time here. The food here is amazing! My wife and I went for lunch today. She had the chopped Italian salad that was very fresh and nicely filled with a variety of diced Italian meats. I had the NYT meatball sub, truly not typical. It's billed as a sub and eaten by meal as if it were a meal. To accompany our food we had what I refer to as \"spa\" water,  chilled water with slices of cucumber to flavor it, very refreshing. We shall return and you should go!"}
{"text":"Cubano- just wrong and cheese not even melted. Potato salad- too salty to eat. 15 bux? Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Wash that tasty Cuban down with a chihuahua sized chocolate chip cookie!!!  Excellent deli with an excellent cause!  The only reason I can't give NYTD five stars is because it's super expensive, otherwise this is the best deli in town by far.  Excellent customer service, superb fresh in house bakery, and their chef knows his stuff.  You won't be disappointed, everything on the menu is good.  I would recommend skipping on the Italian beef, that is the only sandwich I didn't love.  Note: they're closed on Mondays AND Sundays.. and of course we seem to always be in the mood for NYTD on Monday and Sundays."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Real NY here in AZ.  The cookie is world's best.  Pastrami sandwich just like NYC."}
{"text":"While we love to support such an excellent cause this place is all about the food! Such wonderful sandwiches and cookies. We can't wait to come back this will definitely be on our regular rotation now."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here and found this place on Yelp with great reviews.  We decided to try their food out and it was pretty delicious.  Our favorite is the pastrami sandwich:) plus their homemade cookies are huge and delicious as well.  Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"The tag line on their web site is: \"Creating DELICIOUS sandwiches that blend rare ingredients to nourish the soul\". And in time-honored Yoda vernacular we say \"creative they are, delicious it is, and nourish the soul they do!\"  This is the kind of place you visit for the concept, but come back to for the food!  The service, atmosphere and the food are all superb! There's a greeter, Sam, at the door to welcome you with menus and an awesome smile. Orders are taken at the register by Cordell, with friendly efficiency (and we love the bow tie by the way). Drinks are in your hand almost before you ask. And the Country/Industrial (is that a thing?) surroundings are soothing and unconventional.  We visited this past Thursday and ordered Caprese Grilled Cheese and the Itallian Press Sandwich. Both had wonderfully fresh ingredients, a unique little twist and both were fantastic.The deserts looked delicious... I think we'll stop just for desert some afternoon on our way home :)  Just a side note: This is not a difficult place to find but If you're using the Yelp App or Google Maps it might appear that it directly fronts Baseline Road, it does not. The restaurant is in Fry's plaza toward the east end (away from Val Vista)"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, it is everything the name suggests.  When it comes to new restaurants I generally will wait to a review.  I could not wait to shout out NYTDeli.   The restaurant has limited hours 11-4 and closed on Sunday's but don't let that stand in your way.    The mission of this restaurant is so different, their employees all have autism.  Each of the employees I came in contact with were pleasant, cheerful and so happy.  I left full and with the most wonderful feeling.  My Reubens was wonderful, they have a long list of hot and cold sandwiches, hot dogs and salads.  Everything that went by me looked so good.   Make sure you give them a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Husband had the meatball sub and I had the club. SOOOOO good!!!!  Fresh, delicious and well priced. Customer service OUTSTANDING!! Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place!! Great food!!! All three sandwiches we ordered were amazing!! Great service with friendly people. Also has amazing little pies for dessert! I will be going back to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing, helpful and quick service.  Owner knows what they are doing here.  Great food, reasonable prices, and most impoimportantly I love the mission of this place and atmosphere."}
{"text":"From the second I walked in I was very impressed with this place.  It's a little tucked away and easy to miss, but definitely worth the trip.  The staff is incredibly friendly and the sandwiches are delicious.  The unique and amazing chocolate chip cookies can't be missed either.  I live in the area and this will absolutely be making into my regular rotation.  Do yourself a favor and put this spot on your list."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops I have ever been to.  The food, service, and atmosphere was excellent!!!  Do not miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Great place that my brother recommended. Service was very good and the sandwiches even better. All the meats are hand carved and of excellent quality. I had the Ruben Sandwich which was excellent. Highly recommended family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay seriously this is the best deli that we have ever been too I had to pulled pork and my honey had the Italian Roast Beef they were both so good then we brought home cookie and carrot cake yum yum yum"}
{"text":"Great sammiches. The only thing they can do better is swap out the Lay's for hot cheetos and it would be perfect."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in town. Their food is amazing! The ingredients they use are fantastic and the flavors are out of this world. Great service and staff. Highly recommend eating here at least once... (You'll be hooked after that!)"}
{"text":"Can I say just plain AWESOME!!!!!!  The food is amazing. They have everything from hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, Hot dogs, chopped salads, and lots of desserts. It has all the normal stuff and some of their own creations. Mac n cheese dog, NYT Cuban Dog, and Sphegetti sandwich to name a few. HUGE cookies. the ambiance is adorable and the service is great! This is a must try! They do cater as well."}
{"text":"disappointing, was expecting a better Americus bard on reviews and i could have been eating day old subway."}
{"text":"I met Sam walking in the door who is Chuck's son, the owners of the deli. I had the meatball sub and it was delicious. This is a good place to eat to support autistic individuals, as most of the staff has one form or another. My hat off to Chuck for giving all the workers training, hope, and self worth. You guys ROCK..."}
{"text":"probably some of the best deli food I've ever had! Next to no wait time, fast and friendly service all around! Would highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow and Wow!  Not only was everything amazing, but the majority of NYTD's staff is people with developmental disabilities.  Go online and see the short video about their belief in giving people with disabilities a chance.    There were 10 of us for lunch.  For 9 of the 10 to love their meal is highly unusual for my foodie friends.  Every entree, from salads to sandwiches, is large.  Two friends combined efforts, with one ordering a chicken caesar salad and the other a roast beef sandwich, and then shared. Another friend ordered the interesting spaghetti sandwich between two slices of garlic toast.  I had a delicious caprese salad with plenty of fresh mozzarella and tomatoes mixed with greens.  It was presented nicely, with the cheese slices forming a flower.  Two friends ordered what they thought would be typical hot dogs.  But nothing is typical here.  The Cubano dog came wrapped in ham and topped with a layer of pulled pork, pickled cucumber slices, and Swiss cheese.   The Chicago dog had a big layer of veggies on top and came on a poppyseed bun.  Both entrees were huge.  We challenged both of our friends to try to pick up the hot dog and take a bite.  They managed to hold them up, but after the photo session, set them down on the plate and ate them with a knife and fork.    Even though most took half of their sandwiches home, we couldn't resist the big chocolate chip cookies that looked like scones.  They were made from a secret recipe of the chef's mother.    This place is a bit difficult to find.  Go to the Fry's on Baseline and Val Vista, then drive in the parking lot past Fry's almost to the end of the rather empty strip mall."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Love the food, service is outstanding and great menu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time here, second time full and happy. I had the tuna melt this time and it was great. Open face on rye bread, with a thick slab of cheese, chips and pickle. I don't fill easily especially without french fries, but I walk out satisfied. Some day I want the pastrami or the Reuben, but I'll have to skip breakfast to even stand a chance with these ( 1/2 lb...)  I've eaten in some of the NY delis, and this place is comparable. That's a real achievement in Arizona.  Try it. Then you'll try it again... And again...etc"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful dining experience! We went to NYTD for dinner (they're open later!) and ordered our food. The service was exceptional and the food was delicious! As someone who works with the population, I am so thankful for those who work here and began this mission to provide jobs for people on the spectrum. Chef W came out and spent a bit of time talking to us. We will absolutely be back! What a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden location that is worth seeking out it is located on the backside of a \"shopping strip mall\". They do have a sign on the southside of Baseline but if you are not looking for it you will drive by.  The food is first class and fresh. The service is prompt and attentive from greeting through service and good bye. I enjoyed the Pastrami and my wife enjoyed the Chicken Salad. They offer a refreshing cucumber water as their basic water very refreshing.  This was our first visit bet will not be our last we we delighted to find such a refreshing location in the East Valley"}
{"text":"We just had to try this place because of all the five stars it got. I ordered the famous chocolate chip cookie and the chopped chicken salad and my husband got the special of the day - the steak and cheese sandwich. The cookie is huge but to be honest was just ok / maybe if they used real butter and a bit more sugar - it was more salty than sweet and I missed that homemade taste (when u use real butter). The chicken salad was big and pretty good - I would have preferred some crunch in the chicken salad like some celery. My husband's sandwich was good but had some grizzly pieces in it. Our server could have smiled and she seemed a bit annoyed when I asked for extra salad dressing. Very pricey for a deli lunch - $32 for our two meals"}
{"text":"Our first visit today, and we will definitely be returning customers!  The pastrami sandwich was outstanding!  The customer service was outstanding!  Excited to try other items on the menu!  Their cookies looked fabulous, however I was too full to try one! Next time for sure!  Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"This establishment definitely deserves 5 stars. It was my second time at this Deli today and it has quickly become my favorite places around.  The concept for the Deli is also fantastic. It's great to see such an amazing opportunity available for individuals with developmental disabilities.  The employees are all super friendly and helpful. As soon as you walk in the door, there is a young man there who greets you and immediately takes care of you.   Both times being there, my mother and I both order the Pastrami Sandwich and Chicken Chopped Salad to share. Amazing flavor and quality. We will definitely have to branch out to try some more of the menu!   Also, try the cookies! They are homemade and huge.  I love love love this place. Thank you NYTD!"}
{"text":"The BBQ pork was delicious!!  We also tried the pastrami, not as good as our favorite spot but still yummy!  I would go back just for their Mac and Cheese though!  It was so good!  Drinks are a little pricey for a can of soda or small cup of tea, so I'll stick with water next time."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and wonderful. Had an awesome tuna melt that was made just right, and then walked out with a delightful blueberry muffin. Everyone there was always polite and checked in. Definitely going to come back and bring people with me!"}
{"text":"A terrific find! Going back to eat our way through the menu. The owner and staff couldn't be nicer. Holding back the fifth star until they add New York style \"Egg Creme\" to the drink menu. Matzah Ball Soup would earn my 6th star."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Dallas, TX and after seeing the reviews I had to try this place. It didn't disappoint. The Cuban sandwich was amazing. Also, I got one of the chocolate chip cookies and lets just say I will definitely be back for both. Great food!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The Pastrami sandwich is the best I've had in this state. IT'S huge and tastes awesome. I've been looking for a good Pastrami place that's close. I'm so excited this place is ony a few miles from me. The service was wonderful and they were quick to get my To-go order out to me. Oh and the chocolate chip cookie was amazing."}
{"text":"The absolute best place to eat in the valley.  We try to go at least once a week.  I would recommend this restaurant and its staff to anyone.  I have to figure out a way to get a Godfather into the Regal Theatre when I go to the movies again!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. From the real flower centerpieces to the amazing service. The food... wow. Salads are big. I also ordered the Cuban sandwich. So tasty!  I will definitely continue to make the drive out for this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Delicious food, my whole team at work ordered an array of items and everyone was super satisfied with their food. Only wish I had another set of arms, it was a lot to carry! :P"}
{"text":"The food was awesome and that alone is enough to bring me back.  What keeps me coming back over and over again is the way the owners treat the staff.  My first experience at NYTD was one I will never forget and I wish all employers treated staff members the way NYTD does.    Great leadership, great food, great place to continue to support."}
{"text":"This little unassuming deli is quite good. It's tucked away on the far side of a quiet strip mall, but it's surprisingly spacious and nice inside. Nothing fancy - just nice. I love that they hire people with disabilities, who appear to be better at their jobs than many of the people you see at other places. Cordell, in particular, is an awesome and conscientious employee.   I have had two sandwiches there now and they were both good. The Italian roll can be a lot of bread sometimes, so depending on the sandwich, you might want to consider asking for it on a different type of bread. My only other suggestion would be that they add fountain drinks. I don't really enjoy drinks from a bottle or can. I love ice!  I plan to bring my family back, and continue to support this great little business."}
{"text":"Best Rueben sandwich ever! The owner/chef \"W\" cures his own pastrami! YUM. I love their mission of hiring adults with special needs. Cordell was great at helping me decide to try the Rueben, thanks!!"}
{"text":"There is a gem of a deli off Val Vista and Baseline! First of all, the food is phenomenal! I got the Italian Sub and it was so fresh and the Italian dressing was one of a kind and made the sandwich pop with flavor. But more so than the food, the mission behind the deli that makes it not so typical is they staff individuals with autism. It makes everything taste just a little better when you know that what you're eating and where you're money is going is truly making a difference. They even have some art on the wall for sale that was painted by individuals on the spectrum. The owners and chef came by to see how everything was and were super friendly and you could hear it in the way they talked that they are truly passionate about quality food and quality people and their hearts are all about creating opportunity and life skills for those on the spectrum. So cool! Please go check them out, eat some great food, and support an amazing cause."}
{"text":"Just visited this Deli for the first time today. Had a wonderful experience. The food was delicious and the portions are huge!! The employees are developmentally disabled, mainly autistic, and they do a fantastic job. The place is very clean and inviting and has recently extended their hours to include dinner. I will be back to try the dinner menu! I think this is a great idea and it was easy to see how proud the employees are of their work! Best of luck to you all and I will spread the word as much as I can about eating at Not Your Typical Deli!"}
{"text":"We had read that Trip Advisor rated this deli as Best Place in AZ for a sandwich, so we thought we'd give it a try. The added plus is that they employ the developmentally disabled, which makes me feel good about spending my money there. It's tucked back off Gilbert road near the movie theatre. First take, it's super cute decor, farmhouse chic look, and was greeted by the most helpful employees. As you walk into the restaurant you see a very well stocked case of mouth watering desserts, all made in house. Must try the four layer strawberry cake and the huge chocolate chip cookies! Then comes the deli counter, manned by happy, smiling faces, eager to help (refreshing!) with a good selection of sandwiches. We decided on the Italian, which was generously stacked with meat and cheese on homemade bun, and the Cuban. So so good! We were so impressed, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's so rare to find a restaurant that has the total package. The food is spectacular! I am obsessed with the spaghetti sandwich and their cookies are the best I've ever had. But it's their amazing service and dedication to employing and teaching individuals on the autism spectrum that blows every other restaurant out of the water. Everybody comes to your table and talks with you and makes sure you are having the best food and service. As somebody that works with individuals who have autism, I cannot be more thrilled to see how much the community loves this restaurant as much as I do."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions and tasty. you could share a sandwich and side with a friend and share a cookie and be satisfied. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Can't say anything bad about this place! Owners and employees are super friendly, food came out really fast, and it was delicious!!  We had a cuban and a pastrami. Both were phenomenal. Pastrami is made from scratch in house, none of that boars head stuff!   Go eat at this place!!  Edit - My favorite was the Pastrami!"}
{"text":"I had the spaghetti sandwich today and I'm in love!!!!  It was so comforting and satisfying. The service was outstanding all the way around. I will be back to try the Rueben! Those salads are huge!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious! With giant portions, friendly service and the above and beyond attention to each person will be coming back frequently for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've gone there several times with several friends and I've never had a bad meal. The staff is super friendly. You have to try the giant chocolate chip cookies. They are amazing."}
{"text":"VERY friendly owners and staff! First time here. Pastrami was AMAZING! The Caprese Grill Cheese was also amazing according to my wife. Will be going here a lot more. Very convenient prior to the movies."}
{"text":"Come hungry because the sandwiches are big! Two of us had The Reuben... Best marble rye ever! We're going to enjoy the other half of our sandwiches later. Love the mission of this place, too!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our salads and staff is very friendly , everything is fresh , very comfortable , definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The best deli I have ever eaten at. All homemade fresh meat and sausages. My husband loves the meatball subs. I favor the Rubens. Customer service is beyond spectacular."}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to try Not Your Typical Deli. I came in with two of my girlfriends for lunch. The place is very cute and very clean. The decor is kitschy and there is plenty of seating. The guy behind the counter had a cute bow tie on, I think his name is Cordell. Cordell was very well informed on the menu and was able to give us a quick rundown. Everything is made from scratch, in-house which is always a good thing to hear. We ordered the turkey pesto sandwich, a tuna melt and a Cubano sandwich with pork. Everything was delicious, especially the Cubano and the turkey pesto sandwich. The turkey was thick, carved moist pieces, no sad deli meat here! After ordering at the counter, it didn't take long to get our food. We had several people come check on us to see if we needed anything. After speaking to Cordell we found out that NYTD hires people with developmental disabilities. I didn't think this place could get any better! Not only did we leave feeling satisfied and full, but we felt good about giving them our business. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Updated review: The chef was very nice/responsive and offered to make me a new pastrami sandwich and kids meal. When I went there he was not there but the cashier was very nice and helpful. I showed him the reply from W and he replaced the pastrami sandwich and kids meal. I also ordered the Italian beef sandwich. Kids meal still did not come with a drink but no big deal. The pastrami had good flavor, still a tad chewy. Not bad, just not the best that I've had but I certainly appreciate the effort and great service from the staff! Now the Italian beef sandwich was my favorite! Perfectly seasoned, and the relish was amazing. My husband and I swapped sandwiches. I will certainly return but for the Italian beef and I would love to try their new coffee drinks! The customer service at this place is wonderful! Thank you!      I really wanted to try the pastrami sandwich that is raved about. The first time that I came the electricity had gone out and they were only able to make cold sandwiches so I opted not to buy anything. The second time I called to place an order but was placed on hold for a while so I drove there to order take out. I got the pastrami sandwich, a cookie and kids pasta. The pastrami was ok, it was a bit chewy with barely any mustard. The cookie was very yummy. My son loved his spaghetti but he didn't get the juice box that was supposed to come with his order. The customer service was great. I would visit again but would try something else. The bakery next door is amazing!"}
{"text":"We loved the concept of this deli so we stopped by to check it out. The portions are good sized and I love the artwork on the walls done by Autistic artists!"}
{"text":"Like many have said, this deli gives work experience and training to individuals with autism who may not otherwise have had such and opportunity, which is such a refreshing thing to see. We stopped by today not knowing anything about this place, just that we wanted a good sandwich and they 100% did not disappoint. I got the turkey pesto, my husband got the club and my kids shared a turkey sandwich kids meal all were more than enough food for my family and delicious as well. The customer service was great, the employees were friendly, and my kids both got a bag of chips while we sat and waited for our to go order. We will definitely be back to try some new items on the menu very soon!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough words to express how great this place is!  The staff is wonderful, the food is awesome.  Read the story behind the deli before you go.  Best experience ever!"}
{"text":"Went in for my birthday lunch and was able to have one of the best Pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. All the people in there were extremely nice and helpful. They hire some people with Special Needs and it was so awesome to see that! He sold me on the chocolate chip cookie, \"best cookie ever\"!! Been back multiple times and the service and atmosphere has always been outstanding. Definitely going to be back many times."}
{"text":"love this place!! amazing friendly people and delicious food, the Reuben and cannolis are great!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We went and got several sandwiches with friends - Cubans, pressed Italian, pastrami. We also got the cookie. Everything we ate was delicious including the homemade ranch.   We thought the food they were delivering to other patrons looked amazing as well.  We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"#NYTD has the most welcoming atmosphere with compassion and understanding. Cozy home feel.  Providing employment and training for children and adults with developmental disabilities in a safe environment for their success.  Oh and the REUBEN is absolutely the most AMAZING sandwich OF ALL TIME!  (Add a couple Kolachys and a cherry cannoli to the order too.  You're welcome!)"}
{"text":"I am a job developer/job coach. I AM the fairy job mother. My standards are extremely high. I was apprenhensive walking in. My friend and I were greeted by Sam who shook our hands and asked our names. Sam is a charming young man and he is extremely well suited to be a greeter. I filed in the back of my mind, he shook our hands, is he going to then touch food? He did not. Good job Sam. Cordell took our order. He is a front  of the house rock star employee to be sure., attractive, well dressed, well spoken, charming and an excellent suggestive seller.  The food is amazing but honestly I expected the food to be amazing, it's Chef W after all. I had the caprese grilled cheese, it was excellent. My friend had the Ruben with a side of macaroni and cheese, she said it was the best she has had. Cordell suggested the fresh chocolate chip cookies and they were excellent. I AM impressed. Not your typical restaurant in any way shape or form, It is EXCEPTIONAL"}
{"text":"A great new Deli in Gilbert.  Amazing food with an inspiring staff philosophy that gives work opportunities to those with developmentally challenges.  Nothing is lacking in this delicious menu, food, portions and good will. A must try."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches the Cuban and meatball are very delicious. As far as sandwich shops go this is one of the best in the valley.   Geat service and awesome food location is a little hard to find but worth the search to find it.  Go and you will not be disappointed I can't wait to try other sandwiches"}
{"text":"This Deli was amazing! I got the bacon mac and cheese hotdog and it was huge and fabulous. The service was friendly and I can't wait to go back and try something else (I made a date to go back with a friend next Monday for lunch)."}
{"text":"i've lived in mesa for 3 years now and i am so excited to have finally found my favorite sandwich shop! I mean this place REALLY know how to make one heck of a great sandwich. i tried the NYT CUBANO and my boyfriend had the NYT MEATBALL and they were both excellent, we also split the the Caprese Salad and it was huge! full of flavor. the bread was perfectly toasted, the sauce to the Meatball was not overly done, the Cubano had just the right amount of mustard and toppings, ask about their mission, they really deserve these 5stars! Cordell was an excellent host and server, compliments to the chefs as well! keep up the great work guys! we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Please go here! The food is so amazingly de-lish! Added bonus...the owner is one of the nicest people I have ever met! Every St. Patrick 's Day my husband strikes out finding a good corned beef sandwich. Tonight his sandwich was \"bada**\". My spaghetti sandwich was also really really good. We enjoyed getting to meet a local small-business owner and then were THRILLED to find out he is from our hometown (Go Cleveland!!). We will be returning...with friends and family."}
{"text":"Two words..spaghetti sandwich! This was a monster and so delicious. Also, the staff was SO friendly and helpful. The decor is cute and space is tidy. I will for sure be back for more...after I finish these leftovers."}
{"text":"Quaint, friendly, and delicious! This is a hidden gem in the Gilbert area. Yummy sandwiches that are handcrafted with love! Fresh meats that a shaved to order, and enormous salads that would be easily shared by two. A sweet guy named Sam greeted us at the door immediately as we walked in, and my heart melted as everyone treated me like family. I ordered the chopped salad and was shocked at the generous portion. My sons ordered the grilled cheese which came with chips and a fresh dill pickle. Loved the shabby chic decor and all the friendly faces. Oh! And the cookies are delicious and fresh baked!! I hope word gets out about this local lunch spot."}
{"text":"We found this gem on yelp, surprising, I  know. It was a little confusing when you walk in. Not sure if you sit and order or order at a counter. It is a neat little place though. You can tell that it is family owned which is wonderful. Their menu is relatively small. Not many vegetarian options but it is a deli with a ton of meat options. I tried the spaghetti sandwich and my husband had the daily special. We both thought our food was amazingly delicious. Both messy to eat but fantastic.  It took a little while to get our food and it wasn't busy, but worth the wait. Their drinks are either a bottle or a small fountain. They do have outside dining which is great for our Arizona weather in the winter.  I would go again and hopefully get to try something else."}
{"text":"We visited here a few weeks back and the service was phenomenal. The young man that helped us really went above and beyond and he was really sweet with my two and four year old. The menu was a lot bigger than we expected and we had trouble making decisions on what to get because everything sounded so great. We settled on the Italian beef for my husband and I had a turkey sandwich. We were both very impressed! Our kids had the mac n cheese and a kids turkey sandwich and both were okay. There was fun music playing and the restaurant is very spacious where I didn't feel like my little ones were bugging any of the other guests. They did a great job decorating the place and I loved the little touches like the blue mason jars on the tables. We will definitely be coming back to try the other menu items that sounded so good!  **just wanted to add that the large menu was great and not at all negative. I can see how that could be misunderstood. I think it means we will have more reasons to visit to try the different items!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Very kind staff Nothing but smiles from the moment we walked in. This place is now at the top of my family's list. You MUST try the Cubano!"}
{"text":"Wow... Simply wow. My wife and i got the White BBQ Pork Sandwich... Wow. And patato salad and mac and chesse... Wow. Amazing!  And went to the bakery in there too (One More Bite) and it's BOMB! Got the cherry pie... In love!"}
{"text":"The best meatball sandwich I've ever had, I was surprised to see pesto on it and i think that's what gave it such a unique and complete flavor, the waitstaff is super kind and prompt, and as a brother of someone on the spectrum and someone who works in the food industry myself it really gives me hope that anybody regardless of a developmental different ability can accomplish anything and working in a creative environment such as a kitchen just adds to the potential."}
{"text":"Went here with my Daughter today for lunch . The greeter Sam was very nice. Great food and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We happened upon this deli by chance when driving through Gilbert and Yelped for lunch.  Really great sandwiches and what a fabulous cause. The owners and employees were wonderful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Do not miss this GEM! When they say fresh they mean FRESH! Delicious homemade flavors! Waitstaff was PERFECT! Very accommodating and just as promised... great food! I wish we lived in the area we would be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ate at NYT Deli.  The atmosphere is inviting. My salad was served promptly and was delicious.  Every employee I came into contact with was professional, courteous and friendly.  Oh....and the bakery is exquisite.  I love the concept of providing employment and training for capable adults with autism.  I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"The reviews commenting on this restaurant's dedication to autism and the quaintness of the location are all accurate. But putting all of that aside and looking at the quality of the food and service, and the value for the buck I have to say this place is top tier for deli food. Breaking from the East Valley fixation on \"chain-o-mania\", this place shows the quality that can result from individuals invested in making their business the best it can be and a product that is not formulated by accountants. Have been to this location as well as the previous location about a dozen times. The quality ( and quantity) of the servings is consistently excellent. Sandwiches are generously portioned and the meats are all very good. Hell, even the hot dogs are tops. Having tried all just about all of the sandwich varieties, I can't think of a disappointment. I am especially  fond of the white barbeque pulled pork sandwich. Tangy but not too much sauce or goopy. The potato and macaroni salad sides are fresh and flavorful. Quantities are generous and sandwiches are big enough to split. We typically order one sandwich each and then split and take home the remainder for lunch the next day. Prices are very reasonable. About time Gilbert got a lunch spot with high quality and reasonable priced sandwiches. Yes, the cookies are legendary. And we have ordered pies for special occasions from the bakery in the same location and they are excellent (especially the crusts)."}
{"text":"This is my third time here had the club sandwich this time it was amazing staff is Quick and attentive very quick service prices are great very clean"}
{"text":"I took my niece and nephew here for lunch last week and they were pretty good. Nice sandwiches, you get what you pay for, for sure. But, you do pay kind of a lot as compared to other sandwich places. But, they use really really good ingredients. But, they taste great! I will be back, without the kiddos!"}
{"text":"I've never been more pleased to write a review! On the never ending quest to find the perfect sandwich, I tearfully can proclaim that I not only found that at this restaurant, but a hearty serving of love and compassion. It's no secret that this restaurant is staffed by those who are autistic/special needs. As the stepmother of a wonderful autistic man, I was personally touched. But I can't even put into words the feeling my husband and I had while dining here--we felt like family. Sam warmly greeted us at the door and Cordell enthusiastically explained the menu. Cordell seriously had a future in food. He described the ingredients like a judge from Chopped!   The food (OH THE FRIGGIN FOOD!!)--I was floored by the flavors. From the best pasta fagioli soup I've ever had, to the best damn BBQ pork sandwich I've had (white BBQ sauce was terrific!!), I can honestly say I would twirl a sign in the street to get this place on the map. The chef/manager \"W\" is so passionate about the quality of ingredients, and it truly shows. He brought us a sample of his homemade meatballs--a firm texture with the right about of spice and substance. They roast all their meats in house as well. I cannot wait to try everything on the menu.   We appreciated meeting everyone today and you are all heroes in my eyes for letting these bright and wonderful kids shine here. This restaurant deserves a spotlight and success. Thank you for making us part of the NYT Deli family."}
{"text":"Was not Impressed with the food at all.  There was nothing to  it to be that great original to make me want to go back at all. Service was beyond slow. I watched one of the employees (seemingly like one of the owners) talking to a couple meanwhile one waitress brought out one flipping salad at a time to a table that was about 8-9 women; the line was getting long and still this \"employee \" never shut her mouth jabbing away to some couple and never bothered once to excuse herself to help out. Just wasn't impressed overall and won't go there again"}
{"text":"Upon my first visit of this institution I was pleasantly surprised of the immediate friendly if ever so slightly awkward customer service provided I ordered the N.Y.T cubano and that first bite--oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a slightly pressed toasted breast of an angel, resting gently on the mustard and ham below, flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then... the pickles! The most playful amazing little pickles! And then glorious pulled pork so exquisite, swirling in your mouth, breaking apart, and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savor so delightful. This is no mere sandwich of pulled pork, ham, Swiss and toasted bread, This is God, speaking to us in food. Well done!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sandwich joint! Highly suggest to anyone visiting Phoenix! Owner is awesome and the food is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"This is the best meatball sandwich I've ever had in my life!  And it's grandma's recipe. I also wasn't expecting how amazingly good their cookies would be. They look like ice cream scoops the way they're served. If you're in this area you've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most unusual and wonderful deli's that I have had the pleasure of eating at. Let's start with the food. Almost everything is made in house. Even the pastrami and corned beef are made in house. One of the things that I enjoyed the most is that the food, while very tasty, is not over seasoned. This means that you will not get heartburn from an over seasoned pastrami.   The two chef's are both fully trained and create some of the fantastic flavors that their food has. Example - they have created their own white BBQ sauce. (Welcome to Alabama!) The sauce is fantastic and I only which they would bottle and sell it because I would be buying it by the gallon.  I had the pastrami on rye, which was a huge sandwich with mustard and a pickle and chips. It was so good! I would have liked to bring half of it home, but to be honest I finished the entire thing at the table.   Companion ordered a salad that easily could have fed 2 people. It came in a huge bowl and there was so much that the left over was taken home and made a full meal.  Their drink assortment has the usual variety along with some drinks that I have never seen before.   Their bakers work at night producing some wonderful fresh baked goods. I had a huge apple pie cookie that was absolutely delicious. Companion had the biggest chocolate chip cookie I have ever seen, and it too, was delicious.  They also have a small selection of  full sized pies. I purchased a lemon chess pie (which I have not seen in many years) that was taken home and was perfect with a homemade crust.  Perhaps one of the very nicest things about this business is that they support those who are on the autism spectrum by hiring them. Fully 80% of the staff are in some way developmentally disabled and and their smiles and willingness to chat if asked is refreshing and may bring tears to your eyes.  The location is on the back side of a mall and not the easiest to find, but is well worth the energy to hunt it down.  The staff keeps it immaculately clean and is very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant has only been open for about 10 months and already has a nice following. I don't usually ask this, but if you are in the neighborhood please patronize this restaurant which is trying so hard to help these people have a job. I know I will be.  5 stars for excellent food, excellent service, and wonderful people trying as hard as they can to help each other."}
{"text":"Love the Frank Sinatra ambiance and the hot sandwiches are killer!  I've been here a couple times now, tried the N.Y.T. Meatball and N.Y.T. Cubano.  I've also splurged and got one of their massive chocolate chip cookies.  Everything was delicious, and the staff is very kind.  I also love what this company stands for, giving employment opportunities to those who have a hard time finding one.  I wish all companies stood for something meaningful like NYTD.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have never eaten here before, I did try yesterday which was a Monday.  I have been very excited about eating here.  My boyfriend and I were walking up to the door talking and opened the door.  The Chef/Owner was standing in an empty restaurant and he just said very sternly WE ARE CLOSED!!!   We did not notice the days/ hours they were open and the door was not locked.   Maybe in the future, you might act a little nicer to patrons and say \" I am sorry, we are closed on Mondays.  I hope you can come back another time to dine with us\".    It was very off putting to have the Chef/Owner be so rude."}
{"text":"Yes indeed! This place is so amazing! Chef W is a genius! The menu has so many great options I will have to come back to try them all! They accommodated my \"weird\" food restrictions and I just had the best grilled cheese with roast beef ever!! The portions are HUGE! The people are awesome and the food is amazing!!  Do yourself a favor and try this place!"}
{"text":"I have only dined here once. The staff was super friendly and nice. I just felt the place was overpriced. I'd come again but not too often."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place yet, you seriously should. From the minute you walk in the door, the staff is the most welcoming I have ever encountered. The food is great too and the portions are HUGE! Try the cookies!"}
{"text":"Gosh, where do I begin?  This little gem has a reason for it's existence other than selling great food for a profit.  The owners help train and create opportunities for those with developmental disabilities and autism, and all the while creating some of the most delicious sandwiches and sides in the Valley of the Sun!  I'm usually really happy about simply finding a great food establishment that takes pride in their product, but this place literally knocks it out of the park!  The obvious passion for scratch made, delicious food is wonderful in and of it's self, but the passion they show for those deserving of a little extra help to just get along in life produces an amazing combination!  I'm proud to know these folks represent all that is good in Arizona and it's people!  Thank You!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sandwiches, salads and chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Everyone was so nice and so friendly and we had the best lunch. I cannot wait to go back. The  chop salad is my new favorite thing!"}
{"text":"First let's talk food. HOLY WOW. We had the Caprese and the pressed pork sandwiches and they far exceeded our expectations. The pork was so flavorful and you could taste the spices. The pesto on the Caprese was DIVINE. We also got the chocolate chip cookies and it was like being T a Midwestern gramma's house!   Now let's talk staff, Sam came and greeted us and Cordell was our cashier. He was a ray of sunshine and was very knowledgable. W, one of the owners and chef came and chatted with us, we felt so welcomed!  And lastly, and this is icing on the cake...the mission. They are providing sustainable jobs and skills to adults with autism. So your soul gets fed too. This place oozes happiness. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Cordell is amazing! He provides a level of service that is above and beyond! He greeted us the moment we walked in. He told us about the deli since it was our first visit. We got the pastrami and cold tuna sandwiches which were very delicious. For desert we got one of their giant chocolate chip cookies which was fantastic. Such a great place. We will be back. Cordell you are the best and a huge asset to Not Your Typical Deli!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and loved it both times! The food was great and staff was amazing. Both times that I had been I didn't even know the mission behind NYTD. When I found out more about their mission I feel even more in love with them! The special needs world is very dear to me, and I love that it's also dear to them."}
{"text":"I've been to this little gem 4 times so far. Home run each time. Thus far, I've tried : 1. Pastrami sandwich 2. Cubano sandwich 3. Italian Beef sandwich 4. Reuben sandwich  These are typical choices for a NY deli but each one garners a perfection of taste and quantity that leave me in yum-struck wonder .  Top that off with the best chocolate chip cookie you can imagine (large enough for 4 people to share- not kidding), and you have the NYT deli. It's one of my new favorite lunches in all of Arizona.   On top of that, the staff is much more like a warm and helpful Midwest hospitality mind set than a typical NY in-your-face brashness, which I think is worth a an extra *star if I could add it to my rating. Who'd of imagined it - great NY food without the beastly NY attitude. Someone finally figured that one out ! Thankfully!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Reuben on St. Patrick's Day and my wife had a Turkey Pesto Panini. Both were delicious and the service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for lunch, i ordered the Deli Chop and she ordered the Turkey Pesto, the salad was so fresh and delicious.  I took a bit of my friends sandwich and the turkey we so moist, it was really yummy.  The staff came over to check on us a few times and walked around refilling drinks.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were in town to visit our ailing dad and on our way to the hospital, starving. We saw the great reviews and stopped, I had the tuna salad and my sister had the hot Italian beef sandwich. Both were fresh, delicious, and priced perfectly. The portions were huge! I usually think huge portions are a bad sign but definitely not in this case.   Chuck the owner came and checked on us and told us about their staff and who they hire and wow, were even more impressed. Come for the food or their purpose, either way, everyone wins!"}
{"text":"Don't know how I've gone so long without eating here. Food is delicious, service is fantastic and the desserts are wonderful. Love the choice in music and the environment is clean and inviting. I suggest you try the Cubano sandwich or the Mac and Cheese Dog. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great, I was with friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed the food- don't skip the homemade cookies"}
{"text":"You can look at all of the other 4 and 5-star reviews for confirmation that the food at NYT Deli is top-notch. And it really is! But today I learned by talking to the owner that they have a much higher calling than just producing wonderful, creative food. Turns out that they hire most of the staff from the ranks of young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder, giving them the opportunity to join the mainstream workforce and learn marketable skills as well as make some money for themselves. And rest assured that the service and experience do not suffer for it. If anything the quality of the service is well above average. The counterman, Cordell, is as enthusiastic and helpful in explaining the menu and the house-made meats and ingredients as anyone I've ever seen. So, when you're in the mood for a satisfying deli meal please put NYT Deli at the top of your go-to list. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We visited this place today and we were impressed.  We were greeted at the door by Sam, a very nice young man who is also a talented artist.  The cashier was extremely friendly and took our order professionally.  The place was very busy.  Our food came out timely and was very good too.  I ordered the caprice grilled cheese which was pressed and very fresh and tasty.  I recommend it.  My son is autistic and I fully support the premise of this restaurant.  Please try this place out and watch the interactions.  It's a beautiful thing to see in action.  We will be back often:)"}
{"text":"This place hands down is amazing not ONLY is the food Delicious loved the greetings as we walked into the deli. Their chocolate chip cookies and AMAZING like they were you old fashioned Grandma Cookies yummy."}
{"text":"Worth finding this little gem! Delicious Italian beef sandwich. Everything is fresh and housemade. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. I had heard great things about NYTD and I was so excited to try it when I was going to be in the area. I ordered the White BBQ Sandwich and it was DELICIOUS. It was a perfect combination of pulled pork, bbq sauce, and slaw. The white BBQ was different but definitely tasty. My friends had the Cubano and the Reuben which they really enjoyed. However, the winner of the meal was the Spaghetti Sandwich. Yes, you read it correctly, the Spaghetti Sandwich. The combination of marinara AND pesto sauce is magical. I cannot even describe the taste of it really. I suggest going there and ordering it. You will be amazed.   The decor is very calming and welcoming. Fresh flowers in mason jars at every table adds a really great personal touch. The service was awesome and I really like that they provide opportunities and mentorship for those with developmental disabilities in several ways. I will gladly make the drive out again to try more sandwiches and Grandma Kathy's chocolate chip cookies. I hear they're a hit!"}
{"text":"This has become our only sandwich shop because nothing else comes close to measuring up! This has also become one of our favorite places to take out-of-towners for a casual lunch. The staff is wonderful, they always treat you like an old friend :) We were pleasantly surprised to find out the meats are cured in-house and almost everything is made from scratch. And the chocolate chip cookies! It is not an overstatement to say that is the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted. Puts my grandmother's recipe to shame (sorry grandma)."}
{"text":"Long wait to get your food. I mean longer than normal. They gave us a free cookie for the long wait. It was pretty good. When we finally ordered I got the caprese grilled cheese. I have to admit it was really delicious...until I found a black hair in it and couldn't finish it. So I'm not quite sure how I feel about this place. Cute aesthetic though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this past Saturday. My husband got the Italian on a sub roll and I ordered the club on sliced Italian with Italian dressing instead of mayo.  The sandwiches were huge, fresh, and delicious. The place was nicely and uniquely decorated. The only down side is no fountain soda - it comes in cans or bottles. They did give my husband a glass of ice on request though. It was really yummy!"}
{"text":"Guys and gals, you've got to stop in here and get a sandwich. I was in the area the other day, saw this place on Yelp and because of the great reviews, I had to stop in. Well the jury is in and this place delivers! Amazing food!   So far I've eaten lunch here 3 days in a row and have been served food that exceeds any expectations I could've had in advance. They can do no wrong! Seriously I told them that.   It starts at the door when you're greeted by genuine smiling faces. Then prepare to have decision paralysis trying to figure out which meal to choose. Fortunately Cordell is there to tell you about each item, how almost everything is made in house and what time and care was put into getting those ingredients into your food. Did I mention that he's Gilbert's server of the year? Well he is!  Then as you sit the kitchen staff goes to work. Not to mention it's a kitchen ran by actual culinary trained professionals. Be on the lookout from a personal greeting by Chef W or Chef Vanessa making sure that everything is to your satisfaction. You will love the enthusiasm.  You know that feeling you get when you order food and you often think it wasn't worth the money? Well check that attitude at the door because when you get your meal, whatever it is, you will be pleasantly delighted to see a big sandwich that is absolutely dressed for presentation and well worth the money. So then you think, \"yeah but I'm sure it's too good to be true. It has to be. I'm always let down at other delis\"... Think again! You bite into it and you're lunged into a flavor extravaganza. From the bread to the meat to the veggies and sauces, it's all just perfect!   Trust me when I say that I'm a big boy who loves his food and I've sampled plenty and this is by far the BEST DELI IVE EVER BEEN TO! I'm no yelp pro and I have no relationship with any of the staff or owners, it's just that good that I sat in the parking lot wanting to share my joy. Do yourself a favor and go check it out.  I saved the best for last. If I haven't already demonstrated why this isn't your typical deli, then maybe this little bit of information will put the icing on the cake. They have a mission. They are socially conscious and have identified an absolute disservice in the American workforce and have done their part to help. Did you know that adults with autism spectrum disorder have an unemployment rate of 90% in AZ? Well NYT Deli has committed to provide training programs to unemployed adults with developmental disorders and most of their staff have some type of disorder. I found this out on my third visit and I am just so impressed! Even better is knowing that the beautiful and delicious sandwich I'm eating was created by an individual who is thankful of the opportunity to make it and so very caring that they deliver perfection.   I just love knowing that I'm getting my money's worth of a great meal, made by great professionals, who are genuinely happy and thankful that they can come to a job, and it all just works. I love it! No seriously I'm in love with this place! Not Your Typical Deli indeed!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch. The food was very good. Our service was perfect. Enjoyed the old diner atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed. We came here because of the 5 stars and they lived up to it. Everyone loved their food including the picky kids. I work in hospitality and I felt like their service was impressive. It was the sweetness of the employees and they did little things to go above and beyond to make it something more than just grabbing a lunch at the deli. We had 4 adults and 5 kids, normal places we would be left to figure out our own seating, here they quickly put tables together and checked that it was to our liking. They checked on us multiple times but it a warm way, not overbearing. Thank you."}
{"text":"I was first greeted by a young man that offered a menu and a handshake. To be frank, i was really impressed by that gesture. I cannot remember the last time I was greeted in this manner. It was really cool to feel like he was genuinely happy to see me; again, not something that is common in most restaurants unfortunately.  I approached the counter to place my order, but before doing so, asked the cashier what he would recommend. Sandwiches are separated between hot sandwiches and cold sandwiches, which all looked tempting. He recommended the meatball so that is what I decided on. The sandwich arrived shortly after placing the order. The sandwich was superb and was a generous serving. I was approached several times to check in to see how the food was and if there was anything else I needed, so the attentiveness was definitely there.   I would highly recommend the deli to anyone looking for quality food and quality people. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the place was clean.  Loved my turkey pesto sandwich on wheat -- fresh and delicious.  Home brewed ice tea was just right!  Sweeteners and other add ins were offered but I liked it as is. This made a great location to meet up with a colleague as it is right off the 60.  I was tempted by the enormous chocolate chip cookie.  Glad I brought it back to the office to share, otherwise I'd have eaten the entire thing and had to double my workout tonight."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! By far the best gluten free Italian roll I have ever had ! The meatball sandwich was delicious! I can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"Beautiful fresh, casual deli restaurant. Amazing salads and sandwiches. The owner is a gem. The salad dressing is amazing on the chopped Tuna salad--watch out. The salads are HUGE. Cookies are truly the best. This will be our new go-to place. While there either ask the owner or read the story about this restaurants mission/charter. Inspiring and beautiful. Happy to bring my business here!!"}
{"text":"This Deli is hidden in a strip center but it's worth finding! They cook their own meats and the pastrami I had was the best I've ever had. The service is great. Google this place and read about the owner's business philosophy. This deli is a gem!"}
{"text":"Really flavorful sandwiches. Huge portions. Very great service. I think they could use some music and more beverage choices but the food was great."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The staff were great, so personable and up beat! The food was amazing and the portions are very generous! The cookies and desserts are to die for! Overall absolutely loved the atmosphere and everything about my visit. Will definitely be back and spread a great word about this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what I can say that hasn't already been said. This place is tucked in the back by the movie theatre and it is an absolute delight.   I was in for lunch and it was pretty slow, but the inside of the shop is great and clean. The people who were there helped me a lot and were patient while I tried to figure out what to have.   Of course, the food was terrific. I had the pressed Italian and it was delicious. I took a cookie to go but I will be back. There were a few sandiwches on the menu that I am eager to try."}
{"text":"I lived near Miami for five years before moving here in 2015. Cubano sandwiches were loved and frequent. Today, NYT Deli prepared the most fracking incredible Cubano sandwiches for us! My wife and I agreed that they were the most tasty we'd ever had - even better than those we loved in South Florida. The ratio of tangy, sweet, and smoke were or perfect. The roll was crisp with a nice bite. The meats were tender and seasoned wonderfully. We can't wait to try everything else! I saw a damn spaghetti sub on the menu, and you know, I'd give it a shot. This place is great. From the service, the prices, the eclectic deco, to the food - nothing here gets missed."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing ! Staff is super friendly and helpful!!& the food is to die for !! Thanks for everything guys!!!:) you're awesome keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Well, you haven't been, you have to go!  The staff from the minute we walked in til the moment we left was kind, fun, sweet, courteous, and very friendly.  The food was wonderful: the Cubano was wonderful, the Mac and Cheese was delicious, my nephew got the Mac and Cheese Dog and I can only imagine how good that was! After lunch we got a dessert and again, they were delicious.  Everyone left happy and stuffed, and I will be back again next time in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not my neck of the woods, turned to Yelp for help. I was not disappointed.  The location is a little weird, it's a pretty empty strip mall, but restaurant inside is very nice and welcoming. I went around 3pm and it was packed, always good sign of a quality place.   Staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Asked for a recommendation, he told me the Cuban, I went with it. Sandwich was really good and fresh. This is petty of me, but my only gripe was that all I received on the side was a small bag of Lays. That could totally be my fault, you may be able to substitute other sides, but I didn't ask.   I will definitely be back with my wife to try some of the other sammies!"}
{"text":"Yes to all of the other reviews. I asked Cordell (? - very helpful man at the counter) what he recommended. He said they are most proud of the Cubano Sandwich and the Pastrami Sandwich. Wow! There was A LOT of pastrami on that sandwich. 1/2 lb, I think. The marbled rye bread was soft and amazing. My 14-year-old daughter had never tried rye bread before and she said, \"it's good\" which for her means \"there are explosions of flavor going on in my mind right now.\" I had the Cubano and the bread, pork, and pickles were all delicious and fresh. I want to go back and try the meatball and white bbq pork sandwiches. And. Those. Cookies. Think crispy cookie outside, cookie dough inside. Whatever your preference, there's about a half lb of cookie there. You'll find a taste that works for you. Love an eatery with a good cause  - I really appreciate how they support autism and being authentic! Nice job NYT Deli!"}
{"text":"This was an absolutely horrible experience. Very slow we waited about a half hour to get food and when we got it they made it wrong and inedible. Will not return."}
{"text":"The real deal !!!   Thank you thank you thank you for bringing a piece of New York to us . Quality product and excellent service and prices. I wish good things for you and your family."}
{"text":"No wonder this deli has all 5 stars and over 230 reviews.  This place is amazing, great food, great cause, great service. You need to try definitely The Godfather sandwich and the Cubano!!! Don't forget the cookie."}
{"text":"I'm trying to think if I've ever had a better pastrami sandwich and I can't remember a better tasting pastrami than the one I just ate. You can tell they don't cut corners on the food. This is a legit deli. I wonder if they make their own bread. The enormous cookie lived up to its reputation. We will definitely be back and we will definitely bring friends.   Delicious food. Great timely service. Good atmosphere. Reasonable prices. And we haven't even tried the bakery side they now offer.   Oh and NYT Deli has a huge heart too."}
{"text":"My child has autism, and this is so close to my heart. Everyone is very friendly and the food though kind of  pricey ,was great!"}
{"text":"Slightly higher prices than I expected but then when I saw their employees and what they do for the special needs community I was blown away!   The food was good, came fast and was filling.  The servers were all young adults with special needs like Autism.  Their art was on the walls for sale and it was pretty great!  This is a must do Mesa stop!"}
{"text":"A touch of home with a county chic vibe and very clean. They bring together value and quality. Was greeted with a genuine smile and a hello with a concern if this was my first visit. Great variety of hot/cold sandwiches, hot dogs and chopped salads. They also had fresh homemade desserts. My opinion is ever town should have a place like this! If any small family business deserves to prosper my prayers are with them whole heartedly. All staff was helpful courteous upbeat and wanted to be there to serve all the patrons that were here. Great job guys will be back...."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. I must say, I was very impressed.  First I want to say their friendliness and customer service is outstanding.  I am very particular about my deli sandwiches and I must say I was not disappointed.  I had the club sandwich on Rye.  The turkey was carved (EXACTLY THE WAY I LIKE IT). I am usually disappointed with other places that give you slimy slices of meat. Anyway not to digress,  the cheeses were of the finest quality as well.  The Swiss cheese comes with the holes the way it should, and you could tell it was fresh sliced as well.  The lettuce and tomato were very fresh.  All together it was the 2nd best club sandwich I have had. The best was Brandiwine Deli in Winter Park Florida. (No longer in business).  To top of the meal I had one of Nona's chocolate chip cookies.   Awesome job!"}
{"text":"TRY THIS PLACE! YOU COULD CONTINUE READING OR, YOU CAN JUST GO AND TASTE IT FOR YOURSELVES! I Stoped in for a quick sandwich and the menu blew me away! Every sanwich sounded delicious.  The owner/chef came out and told me that he cures his own meat and his meatballs are a family recipe! I was torn between the pastrami and the meatball sandwich. The owner was so kind and excited for me to try them both, that he said he would give me meatballs to try with my pastrami! How cool is that? I could tell he is pasionate about what he cooks and it definitely showed it the flavor and quality! Pastrami was tender, not fatty, and smokey. The meatballs were flavorfull woth the smoothest, slightlybtangy, non bitter marinare sauce. I cant wait to go back and try more sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This deli was a refreshing break from the ordinary! Wonderful food and service! The mission of this establishment is truly inspiring. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is money. I went with the Cubano sandwich and it was fantastic.  The people there were super welcoming and very helpful. They even gave us an amazing chocolate chip cookie that was huge!  When I am in town I would be more than happy to go there again."}
{"text":"I was craving a good sandwich today. What I got was an amazing surprise! The white BBQ sandwich was amazing, I have never had something so amazing. The service here is amazing and the atmosphere is very much that of a NY deli. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE! It will not disappoint"}
{"text":"First visit...  the food was generously portioned!  All foods are made in house.  We tried the Pastrami and Meatball Sandwiches.  Wow, awesome flavors . We also had to get a ginormous chocolate chip cookie . Love the ambience and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place! You can only smile here and the chocolate chip cookie....WOW!! They make everything fresh to order and they deliver it Right to your table. Everyone who is there wants to be there and wants to stay!! So good!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great cause. Everyone does an outstanding job. They are happy to see you and work hard to make your meal enjoyable."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with this place. Looked on Yelp for a new place to try... Came in tonight before a movie, was greeted promptly, given a menu and was explained how everything worked. Got recommendations on their most popular items, and went to order from their deli style counter. Everyone was INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful. Ordered the Rueben while my wife ordered the Cubano, got a couple of chocolate chip cookies and went to find a seat.   So for the food: both sandwiches were the best of each type that I can ever remember eating. The cookies were massive, and very tasty. Will definitely come back for the quality of food alone.   Service was great, several people checked in with us to make sure everything was good and everyone was very friendly.   And for the BEST part: the owner/chef came out to greet us, we got to talking and learned that their business model is one that employs people in the community who have either social and/or developmental disabilities. They are professional chefs by trade, and wanted to provide high quality food with a great customer service experience, all while giving back to the community in their own way. Also learned it was their first night that they opened for dinner, lucky coincidence that we came in.   Super impressed, well done  - we will be back. And we will be referring others here."}
{"text":"Finally, a deli worth calling a deli here in my home state of Arizona. As a lover of east coast deli classics such as the pastrami on rye and the reuben, V and W do it right. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive from Deer Valley!  The concept and the food are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing this place pop up on yelp for a few months and finally went there to eat. I had the cuban and it was GREAT. I can't wait to go back and try some other sandwiches. My wife and I split their chocolate chip cookie which was also very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the chocolate chip cookies even more! They're huge and so delicious. It's kind of a mix between a scone and a chocolate chip cookie.  Sandwiches are great and salads are large and delicious.  Service is always amazing! Love Cordell and his bow tie. He is always working, but is always happy to great everyone."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and this place hooks it up. I had the Cuban, and the pastrami on rye. The Cuban was better, in my opinion, than the pastrami but that's because I am partial to Cuban sandwiches. The meat in both had a good clean taste and they were both massive. There is also a bakery inside the shop that has some amazing sweets. The ambiance is nice and open but the chairs inside are extremely uncomfortable. Service was good."}
{"text":"We were in the area and found this place on Yelp. It was 15 minutes until close and we got there at 3:59, one minute to close. We decided to stop in to see if it's OK to order or not. Cordell met us at the door and not only allowed us to order, but was super helpful and gave tips and pointers on what's good here. He answered all our questions and was very positive. I got the NYT Cubano, which was awesome. Saw the amazing looking Choc chip cookies at the counter and added it to my to go order. The cookie was delish, and had a perfect blend of crunchy outside with soft inside. I noticed they also sell Apple pie cookies, which I'll definitely try next time! The chef came out with our orders and was very friendly and conversational. I'll definitely stop by next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches, friendly service and a great mission. The little bakery they share space with has some amazing looking pie and cakes too."}
{"text":"It's so tucked away, we couldn't find it. Signs on the road would be helpful. Can someone give specific directions?"}
{"text":"Not much more to add, the other 300+ reviews sum it up. I ordered the Ruben and it was fantastic, don't miss out on this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! This restaurant hires, trains, and employs people with special needs, and they did a fabulous job! The owners of this restaurant need a special pat on the back! Our service was excellent. The servers and cashier knew their jobs, were polite and friendly. The food was phenomenal! This place will get my service every time I'm in the area! We need more job opportunities like this in our community! Stop by and show these wonderful people you support their hard work too!"}
{"text":"You definitely get the warm family vibe from this place. Staff is very friendly and welcoming.  You've got the dessert counter overflowing with delicious looking pies, cakes, and cookies.  Decent menu, had a few things I was trying to decide between... ended up with pressed Italian, tons of flavor, bread was amazing. Hubs wasn't as impressed with Italian pork.   They had a good variety kids menu too.  Staff was very attentive, almost too much, he noticed me bickering with my husband to go get a box, then the guy came running over with a box  oops was hoping no one was paying attention to that part.   Ended up reheating left overs and everything tasted great the second time around too!   I read they hire people with Autism, explains the attentiveness! That was one of their main goals opening this restaurant, to help them get jobs. They do everything, serve, cook, dishes... what an amazing idea, I hope they grow and continue that mission!"}
{"text":"We are new to AZ and my husband found this place! We went in for lunch yesterday and we were blown away! Everyone was extremely kind and treated us like friends and not just another customer. We didn't even know the story behind NYTD until right before we left which made it even 10x better! We will be back! Delish food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely agree with all of the other reviews. It's a real gem! My hubby had the Ruben and it was awesome. Great fresh bread and ingredients. I had a tuna sub and it too was delicious. Such a friendly staff and cute place. Kind of difficult to find but so glad we kept looking! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"WOW!!  buddy of mine and I went today.  All I can say is I've, they have some incredible sandwiches! I tried the Pastrami, and hands down the best in AZ!  will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome sandwich spot and all around restaurant. The feeling I get is that they have a passion for food and for customer service. I loved my sandwich and my experience."}
{"text":"A great place that I look forward to eating at once again!  I tried the white bbq pork which was a very large sandwich and was delicious. I was filled up by the sandwich alone and I'm not exactly a small dude!  I got my wife and son a sandwich to split which was the pastrami and they loved it.   The gentleman that works the counter was very kind and helpful and the restaurant was clean and well kept. I look forward to supporting this local business again in the near future. Keep up the great product guys"}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place a couple days ago. I have to say, they hit it out of the park. First off, the staff was amazing. Cordell greeted us at the door with a huge smile and warm hello. Folks, this is not your typical staff. All the guys working have autism. And now for the food. I had the meatball sandwich. When it came out, it had 3 large meatballs on it that were smothered in mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. My fiancé had the club sandwich and potato salad. Which, according to her, we're both amazing. My 2 year old daughter had the ham and cheese sandwich, and Cordell asked if we would like it grilled. Needless to say, I had to taste it, and it was very delicious. I highly recommend this place if anyone is looking for a great lunch option."}
{"text":"I took one bite and had to leave a review. The Cuban sandwich is AMAZING! The service was awesome and this business mission is one you ought to support. You owe it to yourself to eat here."}
{"text":"Im italian.  I grew up on Peppers and Eggs.  However,  I do not like the Pepper and egg sandwich served at this deli.  For some reason this is the second Deli that skimps on the peppers.  The added ricotta does nothing for the flavor.  My recommendation dont skimp on the peppers, dont add a bunch of frivolous ingredients.  Eggs, peppers, onions ok.  But thats it.  Let the flavor of the peppers come out and youll have a great sandwich."}
{"text":"The best meatball sandwich I've ever had. Everyone was really nice. Love what they're trying to do here!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite deli sandwich place! Told the wife wanted to try that new deli over by the theater we go to all the time. Well that was the best decision all day! I had their Cuban and my wife had their Pastrami on rye and we split them half each.  Was prob the best sandwich's we have had in years. The cook (owner I think) came over and ask how they were and informed us that all their meats are either locally made or imported from Italy. They were great sandwiches hands down!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service even better.  We were greeted at the door by name (had a name tag on from school) and extended a handshake!  Employees stopped by the table a couple times to ask if we needed anything.  I love what the owners are doing for the special needs community.    Prices were typical of a nice deli, and food portions were large.  I took leftovers home.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise!   They did not scrimp on the deli sandwiches - I could have easily shared with someone and still have been very satisfied.  Their desserts are amazing.  I tried the coconut macaroons and chocolate chip cookies - both were tasty and screamed homemade.  There are many addition homemade desserts I look forward to trying. The staff and owners mingled with diners, providing background and philosophy.  It was a quality and enjoyable experience!  Indoor and outdoor seating offered."}
{"text":"This place is a trifecta of awesomeness!  Great food, great service and a great cause!! We came because of the reviews with HIGH expectations. Somehow they still exceeded them.   From being greeted by the owners, to getting the story of why they started the restaurant (more below), to them helping me choose what I would like best culminating in an amazing meal!!!  They started this restaurant to provide employment for people with disabilities. Not only do you feed your belly with amazing food, but you feed your soul knowing you are helping provide gainful employment for someone who may not otherwise be able to work.   Now let me tell you about the chocolate chip cookies... imagine cookie meets cupcake meets scone and then multiply that by 10. I am a baked goods snob but this truly is the BEST cookie I have ever had. One is big enough to share (but you probably won't want to).   If you like sandwich shops and/ or bakeries at all, you MUST come here!!!"}
{"text":"I have fallen into the yelp scam. My family and I came for lunch after reading all of the amazing reviews. Either these people were paid to leave reviews, or they have no taste buds. I ordered a meatball sub, and it tasted like a stouffers french bread pizza. Terrible cheese, stale bread, and funky meatballs. My husband got a corned beef sandwich. Corned beef was okay, however for the price you didn't get much meat (more bread than anything). The \"deli chips\" are simply a bag of lays on the plate.   The service was good, however a little hovering."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and super great food! Employees are amazing! The chicken chop salad is what I ordered and it was awesome. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"What a great family friendly deli! This was our first visit but definitely not our last. Went in for lunch today and the place was packed. We stood in line waiting to order and was immediately greeted by the hostess/owner. She had asked if we ever dined there, our reply was that it was our first visit. She gave us a little history of the place and what they had to offer. She told us that everything was made in house. They also have a cute bakery set to the side when you walk in (also, made in house). We got to the front and ordered, given a number and found some seats. As we waited my daughter said out loud \"this is the best place ever\". Lol! Just then the owner walked by and heard her. They must've thought it was super cute because she came by and brought my girls a fresh baked cookie and said they had overheard her. We got our lunch and it was wonderful! My husband had the pastrami, I had the turkey pesto and my girls split the kids grilled cheese (they even offered to split it and put it on separate plates). Everything was so good! Definitely Not Your Typical Deli! Owners strolled around and chatted with their guest which I thought was a great touch. Gets these guys on Diners, Drives and Dives with Guy!"}
{"text":"Great food and they have a great business model staffing their store with special needs/autistic persons. What a great model of how to support a community!"}
{"text":"For sure the best Cuban I have ever had, and quite possibly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Before I came in, I told myself I was going to get a salad, but when I smelled the freshly baked bread, the salad was not going to happen. Service is fast and friendly...they even came around to give refills on their refreshing cucumber water.   Sandwiches are huge and you could likely split one. They do not skimp on ingredients.   We also had to try the best chocolate chip cookie in AZ, and we were not disappointed.   Thank you yelpers for helping us find this gem!"}
{"text":"Not Your Typical Deli? You got that right because you can't beat it! I was in another part of town working and Yelped in order to find lunch. I hit the jackpot. All of you who shop at Frys at Val Vista and Baseline are missing out on this fantastic place just right around the corner.   I ordered the egg salad on white bread. Little did I know everything is made fresh including the bread! I took the first bite and had to close my eyes in order to relish the eruption of flavor. All from an egg salad you ask? Yes...all from an egg salad. Check it out and you'll see what I mean. I also ordered a mini cherry pie. Let me say this...I'm not the biggest fan of fruit pies. Throw a chocolate silk pie in front of me and kiss it goodbye. But something told me to try it. Folks...I took one bite with my fork, put the fork down, and picked the pie up out of the tin and ate it with my hand. That's how good it was.   Super friendly people. All wanted to know if I enjoyed the food. VERY clean restaurant. My wife and I are huge non-chain restaurant experimenters. I live over an hour away and I'm bringing her back with me. Seriously this place needs a visit from Guy Fieri and the Triple D crew. And to think I was about to go to Subway. What a tragedy."}
{"text":"This is my 5th trip there. I just live around the corner. Always great until yesterday. I had one of their signature meatball subs on my first visit when they opened and it was awesome. The portion was huge and great for two meals. The meatballs are almost as big as baseballs. But yesterday I ordered the same sub and now it had some green sauce streaks all over it. We couldn't figure out what it was but it sure tasted bad and killed the sub. Next time I have to have them hold it."}
{"text":"Great homemade cooking. The meatballs are crazy good. I had  the cuban when i was there last and they did it really right."}
{"text":"Wow! Can I give this place 100 stars. It's fabulous! The service is beyond exceptional, everyone was soooo friendly and nice. The food was delicious. The place is super cute & clean. So glad I found it. It's a little hidden in the Fry's plaza towards the East end of the plaza."}
{"text":"This place is SO, SO good!  The food is incredible!  My husband and I were visiting from Chicago and stopped in for lunch.  Not only is the food super delicious, but very affordable and huge portion sizes!  And to-die-for chocolate chip cookies!!  Very clean.  Very friendly staff.  But, best of all, the mission behind this restaurant is remarkable -- hiring people with developmental disabilities and giving them real opportunities to excel in life.  BRAVO Not Your Typical Deli!  Keep up the good work!!!!  We will definitely make it a point to return on our next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"When they say it's not your typical deli, they're right. Oh my goodness. I cannot stop raving about this place.   My friend and I split the Mac n Cheese Hot Dog and the Italian Press. Our favorite was the Italian Press - the flavors and spices worked so well together!   We also split a fresh-out-of-the-oven famous chocolate chip cookie and it was to die for! A must try! The flavors were so rich and the cookie was huge!!   The service was amazing as well, Cordell greeted us right when we walked in and kept checking up on us. The other staff was just as friendly and were so easy to talk to.   The decor was very ~*farmer chic*~ with fresh flowers.   Overall, this is a must try, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great cause, large portions, friendly customer service & excellent prices!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible place. I've been twice in 3 days. They have the best sandwich I've ever had, the white bbq pork sandwich and their spaghetti sandwich might just be the second best I've had! The friendliest staff around, a great family atmosphere and probably the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had too! Will definitely be coming here very often and if you're nearby make sure you stop by and try it, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked. Not easy to find on the first time. Front door needs to be loosened up, but once inside, it's all downhill. I had the Pastrami, the sandwich to review anytime you try a new joint. It was fantabulous. It could not be improved on. That said, the menu is endless. I am making it a point to try everything on the menu. Short review, yes, but this is the perfect sandwich joint. For me anyways. You might find something to complain about, but I seriously doubt it."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. The sandwiches  are large enough to split fresh and tasty   I want to go back and try the pork, urban and Italian flattened sandwiches. The salads come in a huge bowl and could be easily split. The coleslaw was very well put together. A cross between Asian and moms .  The staff was helpful, friendly and polite. The mission of this restaurant is to employ people with Autism   Pay them well and respect them. Great place."}
{"text":"I found a new favorite sandwich: the White BBQ PORK!!  It is spectacular!  Full of flavor, sweet, filling. Chased it down with the cherry pie!  I've tried 8 of their desserts so far (I know!) and the cherry is still my favorite. But, taking home a slice of triple chocolate cake, so we'll see how that stacks up in my taste test."}
{"text":"I can not believe the portions here.  My sandwich was unbelievable.  Went with my non and niece.  They both loved there sandwiches too.  My niece especially loved the deli sweet offerings after the sandwich.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about NYTD! Everything on the menu is excellent, my favorite so far is the pastrami sandwich! Definitely save room for a chocolate chip cookie or take one to go, they're AMAZING! Love their community involvement and everything they're doing!"}
{"text":"Wow what a Pleasant surprise. The Ruben was amazing and absolutely huge I couldn't finish the whole sandwich. The kids mac & cheese was divine. I really enjoy that they employ persons with disabilities to work in the restaurant. Service was great and food was so good!   The cookies are humongous"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, friendly staff...I wish we lived here to come more often. The owners were there and chatted with us while we waited for our food.  We look forward to supporting this business on our next trip to Arizona. Anyone looking for some tasty, fresh sandwiches should go for sure! Anyone who has a mac-n-cheese hotdog is worth visiting just on principle."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped in here today because we saw it as we were driving by to go to the grocery store and decided to check it out. I absolutely love this place!! First off, I love that they provide work experience and training to individuals with developmental disabilities and the food is delicious too! I only wish I had been able to try some of the tempting deserts this time.   When we arrived we were greeted right away by Sam who shook our hands, asked our names (and remembered them!) and provided us with a menu. Cordel took our order and provided us with prompt service and complimentary ice water while we waited for our to-go order.   Will totally be back to this deli!!"}
{"text":"One of the best lunch spots in Gilbert. All of their sandwiches are great. The cuban, reuben, italian beef, etc. are all amazing. Also, the best chocolate chip cookie you will fine, especially when they are fresh out of the oven!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sandwich place around this area. The white bbq pork sandwich is my favorite, but really everything we've had here has been awesome. The meats are high quality and so are all the ingredients really. The cookies are great too, and the service is fantastic. Really nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered the cuban and pastrami sandwiches.  Both were good however, the pastrami tasted (and looked) more like corned beef.  Not really convinced I got pastrami.  Regardless, it was good.  The cuban was also good but had too much mustard for my taste.  If I were to order it again I would get the mustard on the side.    They had a case with cakes, pies and such and they all looked great.  Will try them next time.  A word about the location.  It's a Gilbert road address but it's not on Gilbert road.  It's actually to the west of Gilbert road off of Civic Center drive.  I gave it a 4 but probably closer to a 3.5."}
{"text":"Saw a story about this deli on the news regarding the hiring of autistic staff. Our 14 year old son is autistic so we wanted to try it the next time we were in Gilbert. We had very high hopes going in and it exceeded all our expectations. The portions were huge and excellent.  The best Rueben I have ever had. The staff was excellent and very friendly. We will be back every chance we get. I would give it more stars if I could.  Great restaurant and a great cause.   The bakery next door was equally as good as well."}
