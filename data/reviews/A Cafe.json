{"text":"The pancakes here are divine -- crispy buttery edges, soft and fluffy inside. We had great service and got just what we wanted. It doesn't look like much from the outside, so we have Yelp to thank for finding this place."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of the US Bank building and right across the street from the Starbucks in Playhouse Square, hides a tiny gem in the vast world that is breakfast in Cleveland.  One glance at the establishments sign on the wall might have you doing a double take, thinking they left off some letters in the name, but no this is \"The A Cafe\"   I've walked by on my way to Starbucks many times, but this was the one morning where I took the leap and walked in...  A friendly staff awaits, the specials are displayed in several locations, the prices can't be beat!  I wanted pancakes and I wanted eggs.  So I went for both.  Ordering the two eggs and homefries with toast special for $2.50 and 2 pancakes for $1 a pancake.    The food arrived fresh and hot, right off the griddle.  Featuring a generous portion of homefries, toast and eggs.  And two good looking pancakes.  The breakfast tasted perfect (hard to screw up pancakes and eggs) and it was everything I was looking for.  The downtown breakfast scene can be a little sparse, but the A Cafe stands out with its delicious standard breakfast fare, inexpensive prices and friendly service.    They also serve lunch, but that will have to wait for another time."}
{"text":"Burger and a hefty pile of steaming fries for McDonald's price, but better.  Be carful not to burn your tongue on the fries. Good gyro too."}
{"text":"Looking for a good American breakfast? This place has it for less than $8. The guy has been frying up eggs for 23 years, and the waitress has been there 11. The potatoes are crisp and a perfect complement to their specials.  Try their two eggs with two pieces of bacon, sausage and potatoes for $4.99. Good coffee with unlimited refills, too. Not open on the weekends, unfortunately. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Seriously. This place is friendly and serves up good quality diner food - at least for breakfast. Their hash browns are real - not that crap some places serve you that comes out of  a bag. The ketchup is real too. The food tastes high quality. I know these are all nuances... but that's really what makes good diner breakfast better than bad diner breakfast. Oh... it's cheap too. Less than your snarkyfrappiweenie from Starbuck's across the street.   Check it out if you're in the mood for breakfast and you're in the playhouse square area."}
