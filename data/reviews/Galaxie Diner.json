{"text":"I've been here before but couldn't remember if I liked it or not, was in the area yesterday so figured out why not give it a try again.  

Was seated after a short 5 min wait, the menu is small and nothing popped out at me so I went with the breakfast burrito it was under $12 for one and you could order 2 for $14.95 I think.  

When the plate arrived I was thinking to myself this is why I didn't remember this place.  The plate looked so blah and uninspiring but after my first bite I was pleasantly surprised with the flavours.  Finished the plate and was quite content with my selection and thought two would've been too much food. 

Overall it's safe, small menu, ok prices, good service."}
{"text":"Had the chicken souvlaki, I know it's not a creek restaurant but it wasn't that great. The chicken was not cooked to perfection. Probably the breakfast wouldn't of been better."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but had great filling breakfasts both times.At the waitress's suggestion, I added spinach to the Cody's scramble, and have never had a better breakfast. I tried an omlette the second time. Both were good tasting breakfasts, and very filling. Both times, I was set for the day.

Service is prompt and friendly, but I didn't feel I was being rushed out the door. That is a wonder, because they are really short of seats in this place."}
{"text":"By far my favorite spot for breakfast in Calgary.  I do not go there too often just because it is a little pricy. Although it is pricy for breakfast, the food is always excellent.  I always get the breakfast burritos which are packed with flavor and will keep you full until lunch. I always take out of towners here and they all agree that the food is amazing.

One thing to note, this place is always packed.  Expect to wait 10-15 minutes for a table but trust me, it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"So in our quest to try new restaurants we saw the Galaxie Diner on- line and thought we would try it on a Saturday morning with some friends. The wait for a table wasn't too bad for us, but by the time we left it was out the door. (They serve coffee while you wait!) You also need your entire party in attendance before you are seated.

The atmosphere is very retro diner and funky, but the location is TINY! Hence the wait times... We were there with some friends and got a 4 person booth that did not allow for much elbow room while eating. Cozy, but functional.

Apparently there are a lot of food choices they offer that are not on the menu so if you haven't been there before or know someone who has then you are out of luck. We had someone recommend the 'Apple Pie Milkshake' (not on the menu) which my Hubs really enjoyed. 

The only side dish they offer is hash browns and I have to shake my head at this one. They are all pre-cooked and sitting in large pails on the floor. They are soggy and incapable of making them crispy (or won't). I found the food mediocre, at best, with the prices being too high for what you get. 

Glad we tried it, won't go back"}
{"text":"Galaxie Diner is a very cute retro place. It has a good selection of food for the breakfast menu. The food was ok... I didn't think it was great... It was solid but nothing gourmet. I had the montreal smoked meat eggs benny on a croissant. I wasn't too crazy about it. I'd be willing to go back and try something else on the menu. My friend had the traditional breakfast and I tasted some of the beef sausage. Again, I didn't care for it either.  The service was very good. The servers were very attentive and kept coming over the refill the coffee. Definitely not as gourmet as Diner Deluxe though."}
{"text":"Great place.  Awesome food.  Instead of fries you get hash browns with your burger.  Milkshake is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times have left quite happy.  The service is attentative and the food is great. Good portions to keep you full all day and the prices are really reasonable.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic breakfast. I was in Calgary for 5 days and was here for 5 breakfasts. Order the 'Uncle Jesse', it's the best thing on the menu (except it's on the secret menu). 

Uncle Jesse:
3 soft braised eggs
Avocado
Sliced tomato
Ham
Hashbrowns

So good."}
{"text":"By far, my favourite breakfast spot in town. The food is tasty and always fresh. Endless toast and hash browns are a nice touch when you've got a large appetite. I've pretty much had everything on the menu over the last year, and the eggs bennie, available several different ways, and french toast are my favourites."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff and most importantly: DEEEEEE-LICIOUSNESS on a plate! Yea, it's greasy breakfast goodness, but it's way tastier than Denny's; plus, BOTTOMLESS hashbrowns. Does life get any better?!"}
{"text":"There is usually a line but it's always worth the wait. They'll even serve you coffee or water while you're outside waiting. This diner has a great vibe, amazing food, 4 different hot sauces on the table, and serving sizes that won't leave you hungry. Everything I've had has been incredible and is my go to breakfast place. If you're looking for a suggestion to help you make up your mind on what to order - get the burrito it's killer and SO filling (I'd stick with the order of one though, it doesn't look like much but you'll probably need to undo a button upon completion)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Eggs Bennie anywhere - on croissants.  Real milkshakes with real ice cream not frozen milk out of a machine. My favorite picture was taken here of my elderly dad (they even managed to get his wheelchair in so he could dine), blissfully sucking on a milkshake with a finished plate of eggs bennie in front of him. Only recommendation is that pick a time that is off brunch or lunch hours - especially on weekends or you may have to wait awhile outside for seating (but they will bring you coffee while you wait)."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I like diners. This is a typical diner concept: 50's advertisements, checkered floors, but also flat panel Midday service was a bit curt, no smiles or anything just down to business. Coffee was very watered down (maybe that was the style in the 50's). My test of any diner is breakfast, in this case bacon and eggs, which was exactly as you'd expect. Food was cooked perfectly. This is a place where \"food is fuel\". The entire place is due for a good cleaning (scrub those checkered tile floors, please!), it would differentiate you from the multitude of other diners in the area."}
{"text":"Quaint little diner just off of 17th Ave. I've been here a couple times way back when, and have never had a bad experience here - hence the return many years later. Having missed out on AB beef since moving out to Toronto, both of us ended up ordering the Galaxie burger which was great! 

Weekday visits are always best if you want to avoid the weekend brunch crowd because it is a fairly small space. 

If the burger doesn't fill you up, don't forget to ask for more of their yummy hash! It's BOTTOMLESS. Can I have some to go pls?"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for some burgers and milkshakes an we weren't disapponted.  I was in the mood for a salad and soup but the soup wasn't that appetizing to me.  I did add a salad to my burger and I think it was a bad choice.  The Greek salad was very over dressed and was made with iceberg lettuce instead of romaine.  Can't really complained it's a diner.  You can count on this diner for all day breakfast, burgers, fries, and milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I frequented a number of other breakfast spots in Calgary such as Nellie's and The Loop for years, but Galaxie has eclipsed them all. 
Every time I've come here, there's been a line out the door (not that there's any standing room inside), and thankfully the staff brings coffee to everyone waiting. Even with the long lines, it is absolutely worth the wait. The food is spectacular, and I can definitely say I haven't had a tastier or more filling breakfast anywhere in the city. The prices are a couple bucks higher than other comparable places, but most of the meals come with bottomless hashbrowns. Not that you'll really need more food on your plate. 
My personal favourite is the Montreal smoked meat hash made with smoked meat that I assume comes from the deli next door. Despite the crowds, the staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My mom and I were regulars at Belmont Diner before the fire. The Galaxie has a similar menu due to the owners of the Belmont and the Galaxie being related. It is a small joint, so it can be a long wait on the weekend. But, it is so worth it! I usually get either the French Toast or the Spinach, Red Peppers and Onion Eggs Benny. Both are excellent choices and will keep you full for the rest of the day, as portions are quite generous here. My mom always gets the breakfast burritos, and always has enough for breakfast the next day. Service is friendly, and despite how busy the place can get, I've never felt pressured to eat and go. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!!! We went here on a Sunday when there was a massive line up. At first I was a bit nervous about how long the wait was, but a waitress came outside and took my name down. We were inside after 15 minutes. The food was delicious and they have the best milkshakes in the city. This will be my new frequent spot."}
{"text":"The Galaxie Diner is a really cute and cozy retro diner.  With only a handful of tables, (and thanks to its yummy menu and great prices), you'll most likely find a line up outside the diner on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Its location is great, just off of 17th Avenue (lots of great window shopping).   I think it's a great place to take kids for lunch; the atmosphere is fun and interesting, and it's fun to watch the cooks flip the hashbrowns on the grill.

The only downsides I can think of are that it's cash only (not sure if it still is), and I've had blah service on one occasion.  

Tips: They only seat you if everyone in your party is with you.  Try the chocolate milkshake because it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Always have the cron beef hash - cause it is jammed full of corned beef - very rare for that to happen these days."}
{"text":"The chicken clubhouse is probably the best I've ever had - anywhere. Highly decadent so not advised if you're picking it as a lighter choice. All your food is made in full view with speed and care. Limited seating but the wait will be worth it. Service here is always good but you can feel a bit crammed in, especially in the winter with the door constantly opening and closing."}
{"text":"A little pricey for brunch, but the food really is amazing. It's staple brunch food, but done really, really well. It's unfortunate that the space is so small; I don't think I've ever gone there without having to wait at least 20 minutes."}
{"text":"So Here's the Real Deal on this place. 

Small as hell , you might have to wait 
But hey \" good things come to those who wait. 
This place hands down has the best Breakfast in the country ok maybe i'm exaggerating but it's pretty damn close. 

I've seen small cooking area's but a kitchen this small pumping out great food all day long. Way  to go. The staff Rocks the place is small, old school the way it used to be. The way it should be. So if you're looking for then and now kinda place that brings you back when breakfast was simple and tasted great. Well this is the place. The home fries are the best of the best. There's nothing like a old school place. That's the truth the whole truth and nothing but the good food truth. Please feel free to read more of my reviews. I don't give 5 stars out unless they deserve it. I now eat most of my breakfast there or the place around the corner depends on what my taste buds require. 
Good food great eats one place at a time."}
{"text":"Great place, good food, nice service. I highly recommend it if you are from Europe and want to experience a typically north american diner. The interior appears it came straight from the 60s."}
{"text":"If you want a brunch that will leave you satisfied and full for the rest of the day, come here. Good homestyle cooking that's simple and hearty. Get the Montreal smoked meat hash topped with fried egg if you're a protein lover."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast places on the way to work...traditional diner style... GREAT and FRESH and AFFORDABLE bacon, eggs, and hash brown potatoes! M-F before 8am, no waiting."}
{"text":"Yep. Yep. I like Galaxy.

This little joint has always been a favorite of mine and it's for one simple reason; the food here is delicious.

This is quality greasy spoon; mismatched coffee cups and all. Expect bottomless hashbrowns, generous portions, quality ingredients, fresh coffee, juicy bacon, real butter and a hell of a $7 milkshake. For a busy place, the service is quick and you'll never wait really long to get in (that said, on a Saturday or Sunday morning, the wait will be significantly longer).

Bravo Galaxy! You're true-blue diner and nothing more, and that's why I love you."}
{"text":"Huge proportions for its price! 

'50s theme, it's cute and welcoming. Food is always hot and fresh for you! However there is this particular server... She is kind of unpleasant to her guest. She greets guest but when asking her questions, she becomes sarcastic and mean. 

Other than her... It's a great breakfast/brunch/lunch diner :)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this little dinner on 11th.  Previous experience with \"atmospherically-themed\" restaurants have me conditioned to assume they are all just expensive and disappointing (quality of food, service, etc.).  However, there is some substance at Galaxie.  Though I find the menu a little overpriced, $12.50 for a Galaxie Burger with bottomless hashbrowns and 3.35 for lemonade, the service here is very good.  The most novel aspect of Galaxie is the open-style kitchen.  You can see them cook the food while you wait.  It lets me be closer to my food and adds to the old school dinner theme.  My Galaxie Burger was really good, but the hashbrowns were dry.  I did not invoke the bottomless hb option for this reason.  This place screams cliche, small-town dinner, but despite the hyperbolic reach it works.  The atmosphere has that cozy, small community feel.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This is a super diner!  Six of us went for breakfast and every one of them was delish! The servers were awesome & efficient & the wait was reasonable & they provided coffee while waiting."}
{"text":"The Galaxie Diner is one of my favourite breakfast joints. I usually order the Cody Scramble, which is a mixture of scrambled eggs, veggies, and cheese and a side of hashbrowns and toast. I decided to be adventurous today and try the smoked meat hash. I'm glad I did. A mixture of smoked meat, mushrooms, hashbrowns, banana peppers and sauteed onions - it was delicious. I liked the little kick the banana peppers gave it. It is their most expensive breakfast item ($13.75), but definitely worth a try. Their milkshakes are also great. Real ice cream and oh so creamy. Their prices are a bit expensive so while I don't make a weekly trip, it is a great place for a once-in-a-while treat. Make sure you bring cash - they don't take credit cards. Extra nice: if you're waiting outside in line (which is wont to happen on Saturday and Sunday mornings) they will bring out cups of coffee to the shivering soon to be patrons."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent milshakes, you get your plate in 5 min, super fast!
Missing a star since the waitresses are very serious.. ;)"}
{"text":"Love galaxy but was a little surprised at the service this visit. The order was incorrect and the server was slow.  Meals arrived before we even had utensils. On a plus side the maple milkshake was delicious. However just felt like service was lacking we didn't even get offered refills on our coffee.i have been there on busier days and received way better service."}
{"text":"Galaxy dinner is always consistent with their quality. Yummy food at a decent price. On the weekend the lineup may seemed intimidating but it moves quick rapidly. Coffee is always available which eases the wait. All and all a great dinner. Don't miss out on the Montreal Smoke Meat Hash."}
{"text":"I was inspired to visit the Galaxie by my reading of James Martin's \"Calgary: secrets of the city\" (Arsenal Pulp Press, 1999). For whatever reason, I had envisioned a much larger place, especially to bring shelter during the colder times. However, it's not the biggest place. My local friend wisely advised me either get to the diner very early or after the breakfast rush (after 9am). So I made an easy walk from the downtown core (about a 20 min walk) to Galaxie, and found a place at the counter closest to the griddle where all the cooking action was happening--great spot for me! For my breakfast order, I had a veggie benedict, which consisted of spinach, roasted red peppers, sautèed mushrooms and onions, all served atop a grilled croissant with a great version of Hollandaise. Awesome variety of textures and flavors--you'd have to be a bottomless pit not to get filled up after one of these, especially because \"bottomless hashbrowns\" are served up with all breakfast items. And that's only one menu item--many others I'd like to try, both breakfast and lunch eats. The one item that really caught my eye is the apple pie shake; what a nod to something south of the (Canadian) border that sounds just so decadent and yummy. Just hoping to have more good eats at Galaxie again sooner than later!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast joint. Although I haven't been to many outside of walking distance.
Be braced for a line if you don't feel like getting up before 10.
TAKE CASH.

There were times when the line was too long and I kicked rocks on my way to another joint. I just had my mind set on one of their Calgary Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Generous portions and the Huevos Rancheros was incredible! Also the unlimited has Browns were great."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a little expensive but man is it good and I love the old fashion decor and the heavy lineups on weekend mornings. Unlimited hash-browns can be a godsend for some BUT for me, it's the delectable french toast. Fried to perfection and served with some cinnamon, sugar icing, whipped butter, and REAL maple syrup. Even the sausage is amazing and not that cheap Denny's type one. It's like a smokie. 

The other beauty of the place is the real milk-shakes served in the metal mixing cup. Try the malt flavor. It's as close to heaven as it gets."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Woodbridge staple for diner style breakfast! The pancakes are amazing and I make sure to order them every time I go. I am also a fan of the eggs Benedict but would much rather prefer an equal English muffin to egg ratio. I don't know what to do with three eggs and only two muffins! The food is consistently tasty and the atmosphere brings you straight to the 50s."}
{"text":"small, old fashioned. With a deli shop next door. Highly recommend the Montreal smoked"}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed my first breakfast/brunch in Calgary by coming here. It's a fairly small place so expect waiting times. The food is extremely fresh and prepared in a small space. I really enjoyed the feel and environment here. I ordered the Galaxie French Toast with coffee. No complaints at all. The only thing I would want to point out to you all is that they're cooking everything on the same grill space. So the toast was made on the same area as the bacon, ham, eggs, and other things. I realized this much later but if you're vegetarian or follow a strict diet, keep this in mind!"}
{"text":"On a Summer 2014 music tour, I found myself at this little gem in Calgary, Alberta. I had a veggie omelet with hashbrowns and wheat toast like i do everywhere else i go.   Damn y'all!!!  This place has some great food and a friendly staff! My pals and I were wondering around in the Southwest Quadrant of Calgary and I am glad we did.  If i ever land in Calgary again, I am having breakfast here.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in Calgary for breakfast, The portion sizes are very generous and the dishes are original. Make sure to get there early on the weekend, as the place lines up. That said, they do serve coffee to those waiting, and the queue is in the morning sun, so a sleep-in isn't necessarily a bad thing. Also, the Montreal smoked meat hash and Calgary Sandwhich are unreal."}
{"text":"Galaxie was on my mom's hit list when my parents came to visit from Ontario - so of course we checked it out. 

First impressions leave something to be desired, as it's a bit tired looking, but will certainly due for a good 'ol greasy spoon. We loved the little juke boxes at each booth, and the cozy feeling. 

Our friendly and efficient server made and brought our milkshakes right away - and I must admit that this was my favorite part of the meal! A milkshake with real ice cream is pretty hard to beat, and Galaxie mailed it with the perfect thickness and taste. My parents split a tiger tail shake - it was adorable. 

The food was good - not fancy or exaggerated but tasted good and there was plenty of it. What more can you ask for? I would certainly go back to Galaxie - even if only for a milkshake!!"}
{"text":"3.5

Always happy to support a lesser known business, so I gave Galaxie a try. I had the mushroom & swiss burger and a strawberry milkshake. The burger didn't disappoint! A generous amount of cheese - I was pleased :) The servers were willing to answer questions but the service overall wasn't exceptional. The milkshake was about $5 and, interestingly, I  received 2 milkshakes for that price (the server hands you your milkshake in a glass, then gives you a small bucket of extra that amounts to another full portion). That was really nice! It was a quaint place overall which did a decent job of honouring the 50's theme it boasts, although I do think that having the servers dress in diner garb (and with rollerblades!) would be extra special :)"}
{"text":"Really cute and yummy breakfast place.  Gluten-free friendly as well."}
{"text":"My burger tasted funky, I'm pretty sure the meat was off. Long line not worth waiting. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, relaxed staff and great food. Get there early on the weekend if you want a table.

Slightly pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Great little place near 17th.

Food was what you would expect at a diner. Service can be hit or miss... i mean, how many time do you need to remind your server to fill up your coffee at a diner.

BCLT was great and so were the hash browns."}
{"text":"Great breakfast in a casual restaurant set in the '50s. As you walk in you are transported back in time to the era of poodle skirts, Marlyn Monroe and Elvis.

You might have to wait a bit during peak hours but you will be seated, there is no seat yourself done here.

Mon-Fri before 11am gets you the Breakfast Special for $3.99 It includes: 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, homefries and toast (white, brown or rye)

I have also eaten Chicken fingers and fries as well as their burger and their BLT Wrap. Although the lunch menu is good, I love their all day breakfast.

I have gone to many breakfast places and I always come back here, it just doesn't compare with the quality and quantity you get. Just think for $3 you get a breakfast sandwhich assembled at a drive-thru, for a dollar more you could have a full breakfast, served hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast place.  I've searched for something similar in Vancouver but nothing comes close.  Retro cool with a menu to back it up.  The Cody Scramble is my favorite.  Damn, I miss this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cool decor and fast service. Along with great food and quick service what more can you ask for! definitely a hot spot and without accepting reservations you better get in quick and not really great for big groups. But yes amazing food and go for a dish with bottomless toast because they have amazing jams :)"}
{"text":"Super friendly service here. They also have the deli next door. Been here lots and it's always great. 

Wicked breakfasts and sarnies, they also have super duper milkshakes.  

The look of this place is like a 50s diner and they crank out the food.  Just watching the cooks in the open kitchen is amazing.  The owner also has his kid bussing tables and washing dishes so its a family affair. 

The huevos is awesome.  Breakfast burritos, all bennies and my personal favorite the Monte Cristo!   So tough to find this amazing sandwich anywhere.  It's basically savoury French toast in a sandwich with Turkey ham and cheese.  Dip in ketchup for perfection!!!

Love this spot!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my entire experience- if it was based solely on the food alone it would be given a 5 star review because when I went here the first time I had the eggs benedict on a toasted croissant then when I cam here the second time I had the pacific omelette which was absolutely amazing! It was 3 eggs with smoked salmon, spinach and cream cheese. There was so much salmon  in here it was absolutely delicious and it came with a side of hash browns and toast. 
It lost some stars because it is a very small diner with very limited seating and it is also a very popular establishment so having very few tables means it is a long wait. The decor in the restaurant adds well to the theme. In addition to this they have many homemade delicious milkshakes and the unfortunate part is that they only have plain coffee and no lattes or anything ."}
{"text":"This place was really no different than any other breakfast place, the only advantage is that it's a dinner. I live dinners! And this place has that 50s feel all over it. From the pictures on the walls to the coin operated juke box in the corner. 

By the way this place is open on Sunday even though it says on Yelp that it is not. 

The breakfast was great, even though I think it is very difficult to get breakfast wrong, it's a simple meal to cook. The food came to our table in a timely manner, plus our server was friendly. This is the second time I am back here and I am sure it will not be the last."}
{"text":"Tasty selections, quick service. Strays from the norm. Attentive service from waitress but could use a bit more passion! Found prices a bit high for the product. Would return!"}
{"text":"The crab cakes bennies! To die for!
Eggs are cooked to your preference, served on a croissant. Best bennies in Calgary"}
{"text":"Thus is my go-to breakfast place.
Who doesn't like unlimited hashborwns and  hot cup of Joe while waiting outside for a Table.
What do you love more than retro diners.  Nothing!   Go here. Eat some grub and get fat...but don't linger..they will ask you to leave..you must eat and get out...its their slogan."}
{"text":"A 3-egg Eggs Benedict with homemade Hollandaise for $9?  I'm in.

I stopped in on my way to a meeting.  The '50's motif was pretty authentic, if only the waitress had worn a period costume.

The eggs were cooked to a perfect state, with the yolk still oozy and the whites fully cooked.  Two things I noticed: 1) the 3 eggs were poached in little bowls, so they did not have the \"free-form\" look of pot poached eggs, and 2)  the Hollandaise must have been homemade, because it was broken.

I'm OK with the eggs, providing they are cooked to the right state.  The Hollandaise, however, had separated (broken) into butter and cooked egg yolk particles, and was a bit heavy on the lemon juice.

Usually a restaurant will serve you two eggs for $12 or more, so regardless, this is a good deal.  I will certainly go back, looking for the cook to redeem himself with a creamy Hollandaise.  If that fails I'll still go back for eggs over easy.

Of course, there is the entire rest of the menu to explore..."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, awesome omelette. You can get any amount of toppings for the same price so I went for the full amount. The venue is an old school diner, but it's noticeably very cleanly presented. The milkshakes look incredible but I didn't get to try one. Recommended for breakfast!"}
{"text":"huge omlete and yummy tiger stripe milkshake! 
big line up when I was there. no waiting area except on the street, so go on a warm day."}
{"text":"I was looking for something downtown that was inexpensive with good food and no kale or quinoa on the menu  these guys really delivered.  

It's a bit of a hike from downtown but SO worth it!  Service was amazing too."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that gets cold in the winter, it nevertheless has an old style charm. Along with the glamorous decorations are also less glamorous dirty and not very well laid out furnishings. Overall it's a pleasant atmosphere if you don't look too closely. There are also sometimes homeless men popping in to get bottles, apparently this behaviour is encouraged. 

The food itself is decent but expensive. They charge prices similar to Dairy Lane but without the same level of quality I'm afraid. My favourite thing is the Galaxie French Toast, where they ply you with so many calories you can't help but love it. The milkshakes I haven't tried but they seem awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to this diner a dozen or so times. The food is very consistent and the service is good. I've never had any problem getting seat bust this is mostly due to me going there by myself. The hash browns are as endless as the coffee. I usually order The Threesome which is three eggs, toast and hash browns. I recommend getting rye. The Montreal Smoked Meat Hash is excellent. This diner has excellent milkshakes."}
{"text":"The food is amazing i had omelette with ham and bf had steak and eggs the way they cook the steak is delicious .  I highly recommend the place its retro and food is really good."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it sticks in my brain as delicious! I will mention it was the day after Halloween and I was super hungover. But it was delish!! I had an apple pie milkshake that was amazing. Only bad part is it's the size of my bathroom so on the weekend you can wait over an hour, outside, for a seat."}
{"text":"Dear Galaxie Diner,
I miss you so much. Your ewy gewy melted goodness and unlimited hashbrowns. You were my best friend the 2 years i spent in Calgary. Could you please open one in Vancouver.. i will be an investor. 
Best,
Vanessa"}
{"text":"This place makes by far the best eggs Benedict i have ever had!!! I would recommend this place to all my friends. This place is small and would be better if they had more seating, especially on weekends. I usually try to go during the week when people are working."}
{"text":"A charming old diner with great breakfast options, musch if the decor is likely original.

Staff were fantastic! I had the Kalamata, flavourful and good. Hubs had the Calgary Sandwich and was enthusiastic about eating it. I grabbed a bite and can vouch for it.

Would I return? Yes
Would I recommend? Yes"}
{"text":"I took an Airbnb just around the corner from the diner and it's become my go to place for breakfast.
The first time I visited I had the Eggs Bennie with salmon on a croissant roll...Oh yes it was to die for!
Today I had the Montreal Smoked Meat hash and the standards were maintained.
The staff are awesome and really care that you are enjoying your food. Unlimited hash browns and coffee....can life get any better in the morning.
It's a small place so there is a line up out the door on the weekends."}
{"text":"Been ages  since I've been here and absolutely nothing has changed, love it!  This was a regular haunt when I lived in the hood but it's funny how I'm not as in to driving to get to breakfast as I once was.   Well today we happened to be in the hood and thought hey, let's go for brekkie.  Of course we had the same brilliant idea as a number of other people this morning and had to wait outside for a bit.  Thankfully it was pretty warm and heck they bring you coffee so it wasn't a bad wait at all.  It's sad that the music system at the booths no longer works, neat piece of nostalgia but alas where do you find someone to repair such a thing anymore?  The menu is short sweet and to the point.  A couple of fancy offerings like the Galaxie French Toast (coconut and bananas) but overall it's a straightforward eggs, toast, meat and hashbrown selection with a couple of omlettes as well.  I apololgize I paid no attention to the lunch selection as I was focused on breakfast.  Coffee is decent, not bitter, hot and just what you expect with a diner breakfast.  The service is cheerful and efficient.  Presentation is not fancy but seriously its a diner go to the Banff Springs if you want fancy!  Definitely a neighbourhood favorite and I'll have to make sure to hit it on my bike this summer rather than waiting for a chance opportunity when I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"Definitively our favorite breakfast/brunch spot in town. Great food, awesome service. Always busy but for good reasons. We go there at least once a month! Keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times... value for your dollar is as good as it gets.

I tend to try to avoid fried foods, but if you're looking for a great classic breakfast joint that has good quality bacon and eggs, this place is it.

Milkshakes are decent... and I like that they give you the extra in the metal container that they make the shake in.  Delicious.

I usually stick to the Canadian breakfast... two HUGE pancakes, eggs, bacon, Peameal, home fries and more for $10 - can't go wrong!  The pancakes are great too - cooked to perfection.

Service is a bit slow at times... which I would give it an extra star if they would just smile :)

Should you go check the place out?  YES.  I go back on a regular basis, and the kids seem to LOVE going here - and it's super affordable... a total throwback to an old style diner with newer decor etc."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend this place! Amazing food and awesome customer service. Half of our group got breakfast items and the other half lunch... both were great! Awesome malt shake as well. Our waitress was literally working the whole diner and we never felt neglected... in fact she has had some of the best customer relation skills I've seen in this area. Definitely would go back if given the chance!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, it's good breakfast food though I'm not sure if it's worth waiting for more than 15 min. in this cold, or maybe I'm just complaining a bit too much.

Luckily, sat at the counter.  Fast, attentive service, and food arrived within 10 min.

Ordered the Cody Scramble: if these were 3 eggs, they're probably medium-sized lol.  But tasty mushrooms, green onions.  In hindsight, should've went w/ the popular item, and that indeed seemed to be the flying around everywhere on the tables.

Not a fan of sourdough, glad the nice Korean server let me know that, so save it for someone else.  

No doubt it's a small diner and quite packed, probably not a place for bigger groups than 4.  Though there is a U-shaped booth at the end.

No amex.

Worth go backing again.

Should've tried their milkshakes now that I recalled it being mentioned in the thread but I've had Clive's custard on my mind since last nite."}
{"text":"Great place with great prices! The vanilla milkshake was delicious. It was served in a glass with the extra served in a tin container, which was pretty much getting 2 for 1. I got the Galaxie burger which is just a regular classic burger (lettuce, tomato, red onion, dill pickle) but the patty was very juicy, cooked perfectly. I came in craving a burger and i was satisfied. I also ordered a poutine and the fries came crispy, just how i liked it. However they used mixed shredded cheese and not cheese curds but still very tasty. The service was great as well. Our waiter gave us his full attention from the moment we walked in and made sure we were satisfied up until we asked for the bill. Very friendly staff. They were going for a 50's diner feel and they definetly succeeded. I highly recommend this diner and i will definetly go back!"}
{"text":"The Galaxie diner has been around for more than 15 years and boasts the best breakfast and largest omelette in Calgary.  Here you be accommodated and can get any ingredient you want in your omelette for just 14.25 dollars.  

Redesigned as a good ol' fashioned 50s diner, each booth has an original 50s jukebox, with original 50s tunes. There are eggs any way you like them, bennys, pancakes, toast, I already mentioned omelettes.  But how about that 2 double scooped malted ice cream milkshake for just 6.25?

And for the more culinary courageous, try the apple pie milkshake, a slice of American goodness in just 600 ounces, sounds like a whole pie."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classic, old fashioned diner with great food and a cozy environment... if you're craving a different kind of burger... Don't miss this place!
Loved my first experience. Going back!"}
{"text":"Going into this diner is like taking a time machine back to my youth. This is a small neighborhood eatery still using the original layout so it brings back memories. Seating is tight so be prepared to rub elbows and socialize with your fellow diners. 

The breakfast was hot and hearty, worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I'm gonna bullet point this little review.

- Went in for lunch today
- Barely anyone in there and the tables were all dirty 
- Waitress looked annoyed when we tried to order food 
- Ordered granola parfait, grilled ham and cheese and a milkshake 
- The cook had to bring our food to the table, which arrived before our cutlery and our milkshake. Backwards, non? He thought so too.
- We ate the over priced food which was tasty 
- The cook started giving the waitress shit right infront of us. Team Cook! 
- Tallied up the bill which we figured was $30, left $35 and got up to go as waitress was MIA 
- She told us to wait while she sprinted over and printed the bill - which came to $29. She counted the money we left and turned, looked me right in the eye and sneered at me. 

I can take that $5 right back, you know missy. 

That was the worst experience I've had there - but the dirty floors tell me that it probably won't get all that much better. Yummy milkshake though!"}
{"text":"The Galaxie Diner is truly a gem! We drove by and thought it looked neat, so we decided to stop in for breakfast. I tried the Montreal-style smoked meat hash and it was delicious! Some of the best smoked meat I'd tried. The ambiance is kitschy and retro with booths and a counter. Their milkshakes looked really good, and next time I'm up that way I'll stop in for lunch and try one! If you're in Calgary I'd definitely recommend Galaxie for breakfast or lunch. The building is also a classic gem, and there is a deli next door. Well done!"}
{"text":"Lunch for breakfast? Don't mind if I do! I had just flipped over the menu at Galaxie and noticed that it said lunch was available all day long. I've been on a breakfast kick as of late, so a cheeseburger at 10 am on a Friday sounded good to me! Besides a nice soft bun, what stood out about my meal were the three thick slices of tomato on my burger (instead of just one) and the hash browns in place of fries.

I also split a small burgundy cherry milkshake with my breakfast mate. Burgundy cherry makes me think these guys use Foothills ice cream in the making of their awesome sauce shakes. They're thick and plentiful... So unless you've got the capacity to pack away a lot of food, I wouldn't recommend a full one to yourself with the rest of your meal.

Galaxie is tiny. The most you could probably fit around the bigger booth in the back is about 6. There's not exactly a lot of room to wait at the front either. But it's an ideal greasy spoon, the staff are awesome and it all around generally kicks butt!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't been here in probably 7 or 8 years since moving to Edmonton and haven't had a chance to come back until this Christmas break. SO happy I did. It is just as I remembered it. Tiny, busy, and delicious.

There is a long wait for tables at any time, seriously. So be prepared for that. I think my friend and I waited about 25 minutes for a table. So it wasn't too bad. Thankfully it wasn't cold out at all so it didn't really matter and we enjoyed the brisk air outside.

Both my friend and I had eggs benny with hashbrowns and coffee. The coffee is exactly as it should be. That diner coffee that you only get somehow at diners. Load it up with cream or drink it black, its just what you need in the morning. The eggs benny is delicious as always.

Food comes out very fast, but you never feel rushed to leave. It's just a great atmosphere and service. This is definitely a must try in Calgary. I mean the place has been here for years so they must be doing something right.

Side note: I would say this place is NOT great for big groups. Its teeny tiny."}
{"text":"Old style café, small but food is excellent. Coffee could be stronger, and they don't have raw sugar, but I love this place."}
{"text":"NO ONE CAN TRULY WRITE A BAD REVIEW! This place is awesome the food service, everything! I couldnt be happy to hear \"Hey lets go to Galaxie Diner\" I freak at the excitement. Ive been 5 times now. I want to triple those visit this week. Seriously delicious, fair priced, and awesome service."}
{"text":"3...2...1.. BLAST OFF! Okay, so it's a tacky, horribly-chosen angle, but by God I want you to read this review. Don't hold that first sentence against me, I'm about to do you a whole lot of favors. Why? Because Galaxie Diner is... wait for it... out of this world!

OooOoh. That one stung the copywriter in me. Let's move on.

First of all, \"Theme\" restaurants are often like \"Theme\" parks. Hit and miss. There's some great ones, of course, but for every great theme park you'll find a few that creep you out with too-handsy mascots and lame, forced ride names like \"THE INCREDIBLE HULK'S INCREDIBLE TOPSY-TURVY RAGE COASTER!\". Yuck.

Luckily, Galaxie Diner knocks it out of the park with their open-kitchen concept and 1940's charm. As literally every other reviewer has said, it's tiny. For a place called \"Galaxie\" it sure doesn't have much... wait for it... space.

Man, that's so bad it's good. 

Very limited seating, tight aisle-ways and not a whole lot of elbow room - so prepare to stand in line, squish in a booth and make nice with your neighbors. After all, you're about to overhear all of their conversations.

And that's actually one of the perks. I was chatting with my friend about an upcoming concert when one of the servers whipped around and asked, \"Awesome, are you going?!\". Yes, friendly, smiling man in plaid. I AM going. Suddenly the server, my friend and I were chatting like old friends and it wasn't even creepy at all. It was like going in a time machine to an era when people didn't stare stupidly into their iPhones while conversing with each other or wear iPods on the train ride to avoid having to - heaven forbid - talk to people they don't know.

But before I start waxing poetic on the human condition, let's talk about hashbrowns.

I ordered the Calgary Sandwich, mostly because it had so much stuff packed on it that I figured it would have to break multiple scientific laws to not be good. Eggs, cheese, mushrooms, onions, green onions, tomatoes, banana peppers, bacon, beef sausage, mayo. I triple dare you to find a combination of those items that isn't amazing.

My roommate ordered the Montreal Smoked Hash, which he absolutely swears by. At his behest, we also both got vanilla milkshakes. 

Now while the place might be small, portion sizes are HUGE and the hashbrowns never end. It's sort of like when you'd visit your grandma and she'd keep on piling things on to your plate, like slices of toast, and insisting, \"EAT! You're a growing boy!\" (sidenote: Roughly 75% of you just had a warm, happy flashback right there. You're welcome.)

It's a greasy-spoon, come hungry, leave limping setup that really works. Be prepared to have to undo some buttons and have your friends help you out of the booth. Don't worry, you'll run it off later.

There were so many things I wanted to order off the menu that I'll have to come back.

But the one thing I need emphasize here is that the milkshakes were incredible. Don't waste your time with fancy flavors, go straight to the Vanilla. They're huge, frothy, heartwarming and rich - like an overweight, affectionate billionaire. Best I've had in the city, bar none.

Go here for (all day) breakfast. Have a milkshake. Shut off your iPhone. Enjoy."}
{"text":"In case you didn't already know, this place probably has the tastiest breakfast in calgary. Cool vibe, great people working there."}
{"text":"Hands down best eggs benedict on the continent. I've had eggs benedict everywhere from diners to high end restaurants but nothing compares to the one here. 3 perfectly poached eggs in peameal bacon (not Canadian bacon). Awesome crispy home fries. 5 stars each and every time."}
{"text":"The 50's theme is pretty cool with all the old ads for products in a style you just don't see crafted these days. 

The service was absolutely phenomenal, quick, friendly. It was pretty quiet, like one other table while we were there. The waitress actually offered to hold our baby while we ate, we didn't take her up on it, but we were surprised that she had offered.

The food was abundant for sure, I had the quesadillas and it was full of flavour of fresh veggies, and nice and hot on the table. For desert I tried the coconut cream pie, it was awesome, thick, and once again plentiful. The was definitely a satisfied belly."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my buddy who housed me for a bit when I \"visited\" Calgary.

Anyways, on to Galaxie Diner. It's EXTREMELY popular during the weekend, so be sure to come early as possible to secure a table. The kitchen is right up against the counters so you can clearly see all the food being prepped and cooked before your eyes. You'll be watering in the mouth as you imagine their bomb ass hashbrowns being in your mouth.

I would definitely return once I'm back in Calgary. The hospitality here was amzing, and I felt really comfortable there."}
{"text":"Sons favourite local breakfast diner along with 
For Thornhill Woodbridge peeps
Diner set up 
Diner food 
Retro 50s like usual franchises 
But very reliable ,good  and price fair"}
{"text":"This place may be small but it's so worth any wait. The staff are so friendly and I've waited outside in the summer for a table and they will come out and offer you a coffee while your waiting. The menu is awesome and has a home cooked style. My teenagers and I love it here. Very unique cool place to have a great breakfast, brunch!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to for breakfast! best bang for your buck. Food is alright can't complain, the place is just needs a bit of a renovation. Food is fresh and made fast. Can never go wrong with a classic breakfast. 
At peak hours and weekends it's busy so might be hard to get seating. Also the service might be a bit slow as well but I try to go when it's not busy. Love coming here though and will always come back"}
{"text":"My rating for the place is 3.5 for breakfast and lunch.  It's a pretty decent greasy spoon, and owned by the same group that owns the next door Myrthe's Diner and the Avenue Diner as well.

It's definately an above average breakfast, as well as the lunch (really wicked milkshakes admittedly).  I wouldn't call it the best diner in town, or the best breakfast place in town, but in terms of it's \"category\", that is, breakfast greasy spoons, then I would rate this well among the top 3.

I find it a little over priced overall, but it's open early, serves decent coffee, hashbrowns are definately up there as one of my favorites in town and they know how to make a mean milkshake.  It's a little claustrophobic when full, but Calgarians really love this place, and it's great for a quick breakfast (when there's no line ups that is).

I wonder if they have anything to do with the Galaxie Diner in Montreal?"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience, I ordered souvlaki chicken dinner for my son and the rice was spoiled when i let the server know she said i tasted in the kitchen it's alright for me. They dont know customer service, we couldnt eat anything and still they didnt replace the food nor they deduct the money from the bill. I wanted to see the manager amd the server said he went home. This business is running by a south indian family, they dont know anything about the customer service. They served me fries without ketchep, pancake without syrup and cheesecake without spoon. After all that we had to ask the server everytime for everything"}
{"text":"I still don't know how words can express the joy with unlimited hashbrowns and toast. Everything is good here and this is my number one breakfast stop in Calgary"}
{"text":"BOTTOMLESS HASH BROWNS. 
Do I even need to explain why there's 5 stars?!

I got the eggs Benedict and it was so great. I'm pretty sure I got a whole avocado with it, and bottomless hasbrowns is amazing. 

Be prepared to wait. The restaurant is very narrow and small so they can't seat too many people at once. If you're anywhere near breakfast hours, you're going to wait a bit BUT they have coffee for you that they have outside for you to drink while you wait, which is really awesome for them to provide. 

The staff are always friendly, and the food is great."}
{"text":"You should go to this place if you're looking for a reasonably priced, filling, fast and greasy breakfast/dinner. The 50's theme is cool, but everything looks run down and dirty which really turned me off. The floors, splatters on the walls, even the table. My friend and I were the only customers in the store minus a larger woman sitting by the window reading a newspaper/sipping coffee?/doing paperwork. Our food was good though, you can't really mess up with eggs/bacon/sausage/hash. The pancakes were a bit too soft but good nonetheless. And when we asked for a takeout box, the waitress told us it'll be another 25 cents...seriously? I usually don't carry change or cash, and had already paid with credit.. so I had to run to the car but then she said it's fine, next time. Lol.

I would go again, but preferably Cora's because I feel like the atmosphere is a lot better and cleaner."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast items. Very simple/uncomplicated flavours but good nonetheless. Loved the bottomless toast and hash browns idea. Tables are small and lacked elbow room but good experience overall."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at galaxy diner!
Quick to be seated!
Big menu!
Amazing prices!
Fresh and fast food!
What more can you ask for?
It's a very casual place. Gets busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings from everyone going out the night before and partying! 
BEST HANG OVER BREAKFAST!

I will always continue to come here until they change owners."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Galaxie approx. 10 times in the past 2 years...so the food must be decent or I wouldn't go back.

Through no fault of their own, the place is always packed. The wait for seating can be a bit long and the front door is not designed for patron to stand in line while waiting for a table.

Due, in part, to how busy they are, the tables are packed quite close together in attempts to get as many people in as possible. I really do not understand how the waitstaff can manoeuvre through the maze of seating without spilling or dropping anything....but they do. Don't be surprised to have to move for them to let them through...especially if you're at a table.

Reviewing the menu might bring a bit of sticker shock...some of the bkfst combos seem a tad high ($7.99-$10.99) but the quantity of the food you get actually makes it good value for the price. We've tried almost all their bkfst fares...waffles, pancakes, combos, club sandwich, etc and haven't been disappointed with any of them. Service is great.....friendly, efficient and portion size good.

This was my go to place for bkfst however with all the options that have now opened up I visit less frequently...mostly due to the crowds and location (Highway 7....which can get very busy)"}
{"text":"Finally made it here for the first time. Be prepared for a lineup but its worth it to try! Was seated at the bar in about 20-30 minutes. Tiny little place but packed with personality. You can see the guys making your food right up front and its interesting to watch! Tried the eggs benny and the hashbrowns were delicious (bottomless too, so bring your friends with a bottomless stomach here)  Only reason I gave 4 stars is because its not in my top 3 eggs benny for the city. But a great experience all the same."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burrito !  Service was great.  Place is extremely small and cramped up.  Food was worth it tho."}
{"text":"It's a cute diner in Vaughan area serving breakfast all day. Decor is kinda worn out and front entrance needs cleaning. Old dirty mat, sticky door etc. I ordered the cheapest in menu for breakfast $7.29 comes with 3 eggs, home fries, choice of ham, sausages or bacon, whole wheat toast. I can taste old oil used in frying the eggs and ham came soaking in oil must have been grilled on oily grill. The only perfect thing on my plate are crispy home fries but again I still taste old oil used to deep fry these fries. One positive on this visit is to be greeted by a pleasant happy server. She deserves a tip but unfortunately breakfast here is not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"One of the few breakfast place where you can still get the most bang for your buck. Plus the pancakes are actually fire here."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This place can get pretty damn packed, but I'd still wait.  I've been coming here for years.  The food is great, the service is alright, and as busy as it can get, it isn't *toooooo* long of a wait.  I was here just this past weekend.  I think it's the longest I've ever waited for my food.  I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I usually stick with the pot roast dish.  It's always cooked and sauced up great.  This last time was alright, it was kind of dry with little sauce (I had to request some on the side).  It was super busy, so I'm not mad at anyone for the wait.  Thankfully I was hungry so there wasn't much time to throw a fit lol.

I'll always come back here. :)  Def recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the best Eggs Benedict I have had in a long time. Honestly, cannot remember one as good. Orders are cooked where you can see them and served in no time at all. 

The atmosphere is friendly and the staff are great too. The styling of the restaurant is much like a 50's diner. Most of the clientele appeared to be of the hipster crowd - but not all. 

I will likely return for breakfast again."}
{"text":"This place is 'rock star'. We lined up outside and the waitress came outside and gave everyone coffee. That is so classy. You never see that kind of class or service in a breakfast place. I LOVE the tiny booths near the windows. Such a nice cozy feeling being in their. The food was OUTSTANDING!!!! We had the breakfast sandwich..so delicious. It was served nice and hot. Just the way I like it. We actually got a 'milkshake' at breakfast. We wanted to try them. They were awesome. So creamy and delicious. If you are a breakfast person, you have to go here."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day breakfast knowing and expecting the wait, especially for a party of 13. They don't take reservations and said first come first serve. Waited for over 40 min in a line up and there was one party to be seated in front of us.  Suddenly they start asking for parties of 2 or 4 to be seated. Ridiculous! They were giving seats to smaller parties when they could have easily pushed the smaller seats together to accommodate the large parties that were waiting. Had to tell them how to arrange the seating to accommodate the larger parties. Really?!?? I don't even work there and I know their job better than they do. After all is said and done the food is less than average and certainly not worth the aggravation.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome breakfast!! Loved it! The potatoes are the best in the city. Very nice staff. Really cute place.."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I've had breakfast here. The breakfast is always great the atmosphere is fantastic the location can't be beat I've had lunches and breakfast both here with coworkers and With Friends. I don't live in the city but I travel just to come to this Diner the staff are super friendly they want to get to know you by name and I consider him any of them my friends"}
{"text":"Galaxie is my favourite greasy spoon joint in Calgary. 

The Calgary sandwich is my go to, which is just the same as a Cody Scramble with the added bacon but pushed between two slices of bread. 
Hashbrowns and toast are unlimited, make sure you ask for more if you are feeling peckish.
Their milkshakes are also to die for, served right out of the metal mixing container!

Now there are a few rules when dining at Galaxie and you must respect them or else, I will beat you.

1) You must wait to be seated, don't just plonk yourself down at the bar, cause those people ahead of you in line are probably going to take the spot, unless they just really, want a booth. This I have witnessed.

2) While waiting in line, don't accidentally lean against the light switch and result in losing all lighting in the establishment. My fiance's mother has done this.

3) If it's a long line, and it's cold out and the line does snake out the door, please, please, please don't hold the door open so you can kind of feel a faint waft of heat, cause you are causing all the people who are eating and not still wearing their coats to freeze.

4) If you have a party of 5 or more, this probably isn't the place for you as there is only one table that can fit you, and the people ahead of you are going to get it.

5) The clock says it right on it: EAT AND GET OUT. Galaxie is a short order diner: sit, order your food, chat while you wait, eat your food, finish you coffee, but please, for the love of all that is holy, this is not the place to catch up over old times over empty cups for hours on end. 

6) Don't eat the gum they give you with the bill, Dubble Bubble is just disgusting.
