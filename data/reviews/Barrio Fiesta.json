{"text":"The staff behind the counter were not eager to help. I asked if they offered combo, one lady looked at another older lady with a smirk as if mocking my inability to speak tagalog. It wasn't particularly busy that day. Also, the cashier asked for my card without even telling me how much it cost. All around the worse customer service and the food was mediocre at best with very poor selection of food. Terrible customer service. Will not return"}
{"text":"Stopped by Calgary before my afternoon flight. Barrio Fiesta, you didn't disappoint. Putok batok in full effect. I love their Crispy Pata, and Sizzling sisig. They even have bbq isaw! Also they feature live bands at night time. Thank you Ate Lee!"}
{"text":"Good Filipino selection in the heart of Scarborough! 

I usually opt for the 2 dish combo. For the decent price of their combo, they give you a very generous serving.  

My usual items include:
- menudo (the sauce is perfect-not too salty)
- swt&sour fish fillet
- lumpiang shanghai
- palabok
- adobo (chicken and pork)
- beefstik

I also LOVE their halo-halo.  They give you more of the good stuff and less crushed ice!  Around the corner of the store is their grocery.  They have your usual mamma sita mix, snacks and other pinoy imported cooking needs.

I only have 2 problems with this store. First is the serving area.  It's too cramped and a little unorganized.  Second is their customer service. At times I see three or four people working behind the counter but only one person taking orders!  And unless you're non-Filipino expect rude or horrible customer service from their staff."}
{"text":"A turo-turo (to point) style Filipino eatery. You will usually encounter flocks of church goers on weekends from across the street. I think its a convenient neat place to go to when you dont want to cook at home. If this is your first time trying Filipino food, going for lumpia Shanghai  (deep fried meat spring roll), okoy (fried shrimp fritters) is a no fail."}
{"text":"Barrio Fiesta is the OG Filipino restaurant in Scarborough!
One of the best Filipino Restaurants that sell authentic Filipino cuisine.
I've been there since I was a kid growing up in Scarborough, and I usually had Dinuguan, Menudo, Kaldereta, the best Hopia in the city, Bangus, Halo-Halo and Coconut Drink.
The very best filipino food and it is one of my favorite place to eat out."}
{"text":"I've tried many Filipino restaurants around the world, but Barrio Fiesta is among the best Filipino Food I have ever had. I ordered their Kare-Kare, Kaldereta, and Halo-Halo! Extremely pleased with my food and experience! They're outstanding and super friendly as well! Can't wait to go back for my next visit! Will try their famous crispy pata next time :))"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Never had a complaint about the food for the 15+ years I've been coming here.  The only thing I dislike about the place is the service. I seem to ALWAYS be ignored. Usually I'm the only one in the store, and I don't get an acknowledgement. The ladies just keep on talking in the native tongue, while I literally wait and look for one of them to take notice of me. Although the food is mighty good, I wish there was another Filipino store (like this one) close by to me... I'd move there in a blink."}
{"text":"I had the tapsilog and the kare-kare, which were both good. The garlic rice was a pleasant add-on. The surprise is that they had chicken-skin chicharr√≤n to go! Clean restaurant with friendly staff. I would definitely go back again during my future trips to Calgary."}
{"text":"A friend of mine got me into Filipino food, they of course are Filipino. 

On Saturdays sometimes you can even get my favorite dessert, fried plantain in a flour sheet thing is hard to explain but it's called \"Turon\". The store has a nice selection of foods.

{"text":"They have the best crispy pata, kare-kare, sisig and deep fried \"flying fish\". These are the best I've tasted, having been to
a lot of Filipino restaurants here and in the US. The ambiance is nice too with very attentive servers. Highly recommended when you are in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for quality filipino food as well as a warm, friendly setting. The employees are really nice and there is a huge selection of goods and products. A great place to be connected with the filipino community! The place really opens up once you enter and the food is really authentic! If you're in the area this is certainly worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"I had the lowest expectations for this restaurant BUT i was hugely mistaken.

The food is amazing. I ordered sinigang na hipon ( shrimp sour soup) and lechon kawali ( deep fried pork). I can absolutely say their food is something to come back for, each time im in a business trip here in Calgary. 

The restaurant facade ( outside) is nothing extraordinary, but the interior has that local Philippine ambiance. Did i say their food was excellent? This coming from me who knows the kind of food they serve and from someone who loves to cook their kind of dishes. 

Also to top it all off, the staffs are very courteous and attends to my needs. This makes my whole foodie experience with this restaurant an amazing one.

Oooppps gotta go. My halo halo ( mixed preserved fruits with shaved ice and milk) dessert is here !!!!

Check out the pictures so you know what I'm talking about:-)"}
