{"text":"First and last time here! Service sucked! Overpriced and the boneless wings were more like chicken strips dipped in hot sauce and they burned our fries to top it off. What a waste! Turn it back in to natives"}
{"text":"Yesterday, we came here for lunch. The food is ok and we have always had nice servers. My husband went to use the bathroom and was disgusted with how dirty and filthy the bathroom was. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days. This made us wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen.  We won't come back here after seeing the filth in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I will be back.  Unlike the old Native New Yorker, Austins is clean, relaxing, and no longer reeks of stale beer and vomit.  The cuban pizza is uniquely tastey.  Overall great time."}
{"text":"Went here for comedy night. It was awesome! Service was great. I had a great time. Only reason I'm giving it a 3 is cause I haven't tried their food yet"}
{"text":"Food was alright, but sub-par, even for bar food. Fish n chips was below average. Service was reasonable. Wife didn't care for pizza. Would not likely go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Ordered food at 5 and at 6:30 Wer still did not have our food.  The \"General manager\" just gave excuses with zero results. Literally he did nothing get our food, stood behind me doing nothing.  We just left  never to return."}
{"text":"We were driving in the parking lot and stumbled onto this place. My husband loves craft beer and they had a great variety to choose from. Happy hour is awesome.  My house pinot grigio was very good. The food was excellent. Our bartender was the best very nice and the customers next to us were very nice and welcomed us. We cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Due to over burned those meatloaf and French fries too.  Cole straw taste not good.  So it's okay."}
{"text":"After having been on the road for hours, I was just looking for something decent and fast.  What a delightful surprise to stumble across this place!  Stylish decor,  friendly greeting,  upscale yet casusl atmosphere,  and a menu that has something for everyone without moving outside the realm where they could get it wrong.  Know what you do and do it well!  Excellent service and excellent meal. I had the half pound Angus beef burger and fries.  Delish!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new out of Buckeye and decided to try this.  The   Nacho appetizer was very good.  Piled high and tasty. The place is nice and the service was good, she was always close by and attentive.  Husband and I both had a toasted sandwich with fries.  The fries were overdone and dry.  Our child had the pork loin and it was awful!! The Jamaican sauce just did not taste good. The pork was tender but the sauce was so bad even our dogs would not eat it.  Probably will not go back since it was not over the top enough to replace some of the better ones close by and lunch for three was $60 without alcohol."}
{"text":"I thought the beer on tap was a great selection.  The bar  appetizers that we ordered were awesome.  The French fries are scratch made as well as what seems to be alot of their food in there.  We went for the hockey game and there were ample  larges tvs to view.  I was however extremely impressed with Nikki the server we had.  She was professional  polite  and super cool to talk w. She went above and beyond.  Heck., the GM even came out and chatted with customers.  Great place to relax with awesome appetizers and great service.  Happy to see this in Goodyear.."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment, great service!  This is the place to go watch the game!"}
{"text":"Burger with the pretzel bun is great. Good seasoning and they use a good fat content beef. Makes for great flavor.   They have the best wings on this side of town (until Oregano's goes in)  Staff is friendly and they have the best beer selection in goodyear.   Overall atmosphere is great. Family friendly or a great place to catch a fight or a game. Lots of TVs."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here on a Friday night for drinks, it took about 5 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us at the bar but he was the only one back there and he did apologize for the wait. Once we got our drinks we decided to order the fish fry ($8.99) We are born and raised in Milwaukee so we know good fish. The fish here was AWESOME!!  Flaky and tender, not drenched in oil and the french fries were yummy too. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for great drink specials, amazing burgers and great customer service. Had the San Francisco burger that was on point! Their fries are fresh and crispy. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last Friday night. The food was alright but the wait time was terrible. Our waitress was very sweet and apologized for the long wait explaining they had a new cook working. She seemed very busy, and I had to request a water and ranch twice to get each of them. We will try it again to see if they were just off that night due to the new cook or if that's how it is typically run."}
{"text":"Nice place and big improvement over the Native New Yorker that used to be here. Very clean and friendly prompt service. This would have been a five star but one thing; they used to have home made French fries that were the best in the West Valley. They now have the coated garbage every other crap dive in the valley has. The  rest of the menu is great. Please bring back the fries I would be willing to pay more."}
{"text":"We have been to Austin's 3 times....  The first two visits were pretty good..   The last one was enough to never return again.  $9 for chips and Guacamole..  They are overpriced.....    In addition, on the last visit there were two drunk guys yelling at each other as they sat at the bar....   kinda trashy..."}
{"text":"The three stars is for the wonderful customer service. Tried the Jambalaya and it wasn't too great. Not a lot of flavor! The pretzel sticks were too hard and salty. Would come again for drinks only.."}
{"text":"We went in last night and it was not busy at all! I don't think they're gonna last. Seems like everybody had desperation in their eyes."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. Food is outstanding. Elizabeth the bartender/manager is awesome! Great time."}
{"text":"Hung out here on a nice Sunday afternoon.  Enjoyed the Green Chile fries and the Cuban pizza with a few friends. Both were excellent and arrived very timely. Server was nice and very attentive.   Love the upgrades of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We are loving Austin's!  The staff are amazing, hard working, accommodating, friendly, and they make our visits there like coming home.  The food is great, my only critique are the fries, it's like the fryer is too hot, they are really over cooked most if the time.  But seriously, it's just fries so who really cares? Everything else there ROCKS!  I highly recommend the gluten free pizza crust.  I had their Cuban pizza with added bacon and it was so good!  Also, their green chili is wonderful!  Have it on fries, as nachos, or just a bowl of it!  I actually added it to a pizza, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had to drop a star... The consistency isn't there right now. Miss the OG bartender too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We had a great time there and our bartender Donovan was helpful and funny."}
{"text":"This took the place of Native New Yorker in our neighborhood.  While I truly love supporting and eating at local establishments, this one just doesn't stand out enough to me.  Sure, it's a bar with American food.  But there is nothing spectacular that tops other places I've been to.    I can tell you they definitely improved the atmosphere and inside since Native New Yorker completely missed the mark when they knocked the wall down.  They have a small stage that must host local talent on some nights.  There are two huge pull-down screens and projectors as well as many other TVs set around the restaurant.    I had their hot wings which were pretty tasty...but I was flicking the sauce all over myself because they were a little too tough on the outside.  My hubby had one of their burgers and also liked it but just thought it was average.  We may or may not go back since it is a nice local spot.  After all, they have a nice selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I love working here! I get to work the lunch shift mostly with Dave as my manager. It is so refreshing working for an owner that really cares for their employees. All the girls I work with like having a manager that helps out on the floor and can relate to us during down time. Hopefully I will get to work here for years to come!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this new restaurant since we like to give our business to local restaurants. This restaurant is in the chain with Marleys (located on Bell Rd...not Majerles). We visited on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quiet as can be. Only 2 other tables were occupied. Our server, Donny, was friendly and attentive however the length of time it took for our food to arrive was horrible. 30 minutes for wings and a burger (med). I can understand if they were busy but other tables that arrived after us received their food before us. Clearly something happened but we were never given an explanation. My husband ordered a side salad with his meal and there wasn't anything great about it. No croutons just lettuce and cheese.   I ordered the burger on a pretzel bun and it was tasty. The fries weren't anything great."}
{"text":"My husband and I Have dined here 6 times and each time we have had excellent service, atmosphere, and MOST importantly food!  Their ribs are to die for, salads big and healthy good, and finally the pizzas have been amazingly yummy.!  We get such wonderful service and the bartenders and waitresses REMEMbER you!  Plus if you are into SPORTS, You are in luck what an atmosphere!  Bottom line.... we love the food!"}
{"text":"The patty melt is one of the best in the West Valley. French fries are real, honest-to-God fresh potatoes. Nachos are freaking huge, be sure to share. Cheesecake is homemade. Great tap list. I needed a new neighborhood bar, looks like I found one  =D"}
{"text":"We got to see the games for Monday night football at happy hour prices!!! They have a full bar, and huge projection screens:) the crowd was middle-aged and chill. We ordered & shared the lasagna special for $10.99 with unlimited soup and salad and got full! Great quality comfort food, so don't come if you're on a diet;)"}
{"text":"We went to their comedy night, offered every other Saturday night, and was thoroughly entertained!  This is a great venue for the west valley, especially Goodyear!  I was also impressed with the food.  I am always suspicious when the menu has Green Chile and when you eat it, it is bland or taste like a bell pepper.  Well Austin's Green Chile Nachos didn't disappoint this Albuquerque, NM born and raised.  It was good to taste good, spicy Green Chile, bravo!  We'll be back for another comedy night!"}
{"text":"We had a good lunch. The Reuben had 2 kinds of cheese, turkey BBQ BLT was delicious, the chicken strips had thyme which was a nice twist, and buffalo chicken wrap was good. The only I would change is the coleslaw. As a side item the serving size was small. The restaurant is well run, our waitress was attentive and management is on site and present (nice change from most restaurants lately). I was not a fan of the restaurant that was here before so this a welcome change."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service!  We had the guacamole burger, BBQ burger, Cobb salad, and the apple cranberry salad. Everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"We were on a road trip and were starving. Thought we'd try Austin's. Very surprised at how great the food was. My husband had wings and a really good dark stout. He said the wings were better than BJ's! His fav. I had a turkey BLT with Fries. They were delicious It was hard to leave any left on the plate . And the waitress was awesome! It's a sports bar and noisy and she sat us at a much quieter table, because we aren't young anymore! Not only that she was super friendly and thoughtful didn't mind our extra requests at all, more Sauce, extra crispy fries, wings dry with Side of sauce instead of tossed in the Sauce. Etc.... Next time we are here we will be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed with anything. Ordered wings, came with FRIES ordered burger came with FRIES ordered Ruben came with FRIES..enough already do the tacos come with fries too? The Ruben was bland and the burger was built wrong. To put mayo under the bun, now the bun is soggy and turned to mush. The wings were dry and chewy which like most they are pre-cooked before going in the fryer.  No need to return"}
{"text":"We have been so excited for this restaurant to open! We decided to check it out tonight. First, let me say, the service was EXCELLENT. The servers were friendly and attentive. I don't think any of us ever had an empty glass. The food arrived promptly and accurately.  My kids split a Bbq bacon burger and an order of medium wings. My husband chose the fish and chips and I had the onion marmalade smothered pork chops.  The kids reported the burger was good, but the wings were too salty.  At first, my pork chops  and garlic mashed potatoes were bland, so, I added salt and pepper which helped. Lastly, my husband's fish was, well, fishy, so he didn't finish it.  Hopefully, they will improve the quality of the food. If not, Augie's up the road will continue to be our regular haunt ."}
{"text":"Best sports bar food in the west valley Excellent pizza and wings Great drink specials after traditional happy hour times :) Our waiter Jordan was terrific !"}
{"text":"Huge Improvement!  We first came in to Austin's shortly after they opened and thought that it was just \"so-so\". The food was good,  but it felt like they had really just changed the name and updated the decor from Native New Yorker. I hadn't really thought to go back and try it out until this evening when I decided to come in with my daughter for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised to notice they had opened up the space by getting rid of the middle booths and I was told of their plans to build a stage for live events. The staff was Friendly and much more accommodating than my previous visit.   We ordered the Shrimp Dip appetizer and wings. The wings were huge and very good! Way better than BWW, which we frequent.  Suffice to say, my opinion of Austin's has changed and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I really didn't enjoy my time/money spent here. They had no vegetarian options for me, the service was bad, and the price of the meals are not really worth what you get. If you're a  big meat eater, I can see the appeal but even so, you pay a lot.   I did like that they offer comedy shows here. On this side of Goodyear, we need all the entertainment we can get. I wish them all the best since the last restaurant there failed miserably. Vegetarians be warmed!! You can only get fries or a salad."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Not so great staff. The language from several waitresses  as they came and went from the bar and kitchen area was frat house, hanging with your friends crude. Tall and thin Girl with curly black hair was the instigator. We sat at the bar trying to enjoy our drinks and left after one.   I will say the bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful. We didn't eat during this visit and probably won't go back based on what we heard and saw.  Behavior like this has no place in a restaraunt."}
{"text":"Food ok had pork tenderloin and fries Fries under cooked  pork ok spice too hot and bit tasteless Companion had corn beef sandwich  Sandwich good but fries also disappointing as under cooked  Service good"}
{"text":"Had a great birthday lunch!  Posted pics. Kids eat free with an adult entree purchase,  free dessert on your birthday! Loved the jamaican jerk wings and shrimp dip appetizer. I don't care about those other reviews, I love the fries!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great prices. Enough said. The Cuban Sandwich and the Cuban Pizza are amazing."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered a piña colada and when they brought it was just wrong there was lots of ice that I had to chew and it tasted like a smoothie. Tasted no alcohol it also comes with whipped cream just be aware!!! They brought me another one which they fixed but this one was like water! Tasted no alcohol I chugged the whole thing and I don't feel alcohol. Not worth the money. I had many pina coladas and every other place was strong except this place. After I said it's not strong the waiter doesn't offer to add another shot or anything. Not a good experience. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for somewhere new to eat in Goodyear. We decided to give Austin's a try. This is a new restaurant that just opened in the old native New Yorker location in the Safeway shopping center. The first thing we noticed upon walking in was the updated wall between the entry and the bar. I love the way it looks. It felt much more up to date and more upscale then when it was NNY. We decided to sit in the restaurant and we were seated quickly. There were several tv's both in the bar and located throughout the main dining area.  Our server took our drink order quickly and we were happy to see a fairly large amount of beers on tap including a couple of my favorites like Kilt lifter, Moose Drool and Blue Moon. They also had several to choose from in bottles and lots of mixed drink options. Their wine list was fairly limited but they had some decent selections.  The menu contained a wide of variety of items like taco's, pizza & wings, burgers, salads and sandwiches or even steaks. It would be hard not to find something that interested you.  I went with the green chile fries which were super delicious and came in a large portion. Hubby had the BBQ bacon burger which he really enjoyed.  Our server was great and made sure our drinks were refilled and that we had everything we needed.  Because this restaurant is close to our house I am super happy that another restaurant opened in this location. I am anxious to go back and try something else or maybe take in a game. Enjoy~"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!! Best micro brew beer selection on this side of town. Definitely  not just your run of the mill boring beers. The food was great too! Cuban sandwich was delicious along with great wings that were on special for .45 cents a wing. French fries were the best around definitely homemade. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I think it's pretty SHITTY that we have to go to the labor bored to get paid by the owner. It's karma that your restaurants do not stay open"}
{"text":"I really dig the green chili :) the staff is super friendly and very helpful with menu selection :D"}
