{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and comfortable, but the food is not good. The eggs are not cooked properly and lack salt. The bacon is very chewy and greasy. Will be going to the many other breakfast choices around here."}
{"text":"The French Toast and the various omelettes here are good; I've never had any issues with soggy bread or undercooked eggs.

The atmosphere is pretty nice, but seems like somewhere your grandma would frequent; their main demographic is the elderly snowbird-type that come to Scottsdale to flee the cold. 

The waiters and waitresses are actually a little snippy; I've gone 3 times, and every time my waiter has spilled my drink because they slam down the cups. They also wait quite awhile after getting drink orders before a) bringing you your drinks, and b) getting your food order.

Overall, the food is pretty good for a light brunch, but I'd probably rather go to Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient, with a beautiful outdoor seating that we took advantage of. There seemed to be a long line, but a short wait. Large varied menu and no problem with the changes that we wanted. The food came out quickly and with a very nice presentation. Everything was wonderful. For the price a great buy on a beautiful Saturday morning."}
{"text":"We love this good egg! Noticed a lot of bad reviews, not sure why, we've always had great service, Michael was our sever today, he was especially great. My fave is the veggie skillet, I get it over the potatoes and add the black beans for $1. Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Okay, I feel the need to redeem my friendly neighborhood breakfast stop.  Other reviews have been quite scathing, and although I don't think this is the end-all, be-all of breakfast venues, I do rather enjoy it.  My 2-year-old and I go about every other week for a weekend breakfast, and we love it.

Things I like:

-It's corporate, but it feels \"small business\"
-Free coffee while you wait for a seat, with flavored creamer if you like 
-Short wait times even when it looks crowded
-Flavored coffee at no charge (over regular), flavored creamers, and herbal iced tea (as well as traditional)
-Giant to-go cups for your beverage when you leave (if it's not offered, ask)
-A GIANT menu with myriad possibilities; obviously some will be better than others (check it out online at www.goodeggrestaurants.com)
   ***The best home fries I've ever had; perfectly cooked and seasoned
   ***HEALTHY options, many at no additional charge; for example, you can sub fresh fruit or black beans for home fries at no charge
   ***A good (and vegetarian-friendly) kid's menu, which, although pricier than some places at $4.99, is a VERY generous portion; additionally, you can make healthy substitutions for kids' meals very easily, such as whole wheat pancakes instead of regular, or fruit instead of bacon at no charge
   ***Don't be discouraged by the $3.95 single pancake - it's HUGE, and you can add anything from mandarin oranges to candied pecans to butterscotch chips (for 50 cents each); also whole wheat batter doesn't cost extra like many places
   ***The $2.95 fresh cinnamon roll is hot and gooey with icing and gigantic, perfect for sharing
-Seriously kid-friendly: Good kid's menu, crayons, a \"treasure chest\" in the lobby with small treats for on your way out the door (if you choose), plenty of high chairs, and friendly servers who not only offer to bring your child's meal first, but also (usually) will bring out free Cheerios and sliced bananas if your child is really hungry and can't wait to eat
   ***You can get 100% pure Vermont maple syrup; sure, it's $1.50 for a small bottle, but it's plenty for sharing and worth every drop
-Really generous portions on everything, and tasty stuff at that
-A frequent diner program that gives you a free meal once you've bought 5

Things I think could improve:
-People are right about the hollandaise; there's something not quite right about it.  It's oddly tangy, and seemed a little gelatinous when I tried it.  Get it on the side if you absolutely must try something that comes with it.
-The low-carb tortillas were a little doughy for my liking, but that may be because I'm not used to them
-You have to pay at the front counter, which for a single mom with a 2-year-old can be a pain, but I have to say that our server today offered to stay at the table and entertain him while I went up to pay...
-Service can be hit-or-miss.  There are some servers who just don't quite have their sh*t together.  Ask for Diane if you can; she's fantastic!

My food has always arrived quickly, been hot, and tasty.  Everyone is friendly and helpful, and I think it's worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"I hate doing this since the staff has been VERY nice, and the discount card is one of the best deals around, but  I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT CARRY OUT UNLESS YOU CHECK YOUR ORDER.
My small business does carryout food from local restaurants at least once a week, and as yet we have not gotten a correct order more than once in a row.....
Today, we did 3 items
1. A 3-cheese omelet with crispy potatoes and an English muffin.
The omelet had no cheese in the center, and in the past the \"3\" cheeses were cheddar cheddar and cheddar.  Also, the \"crispy\" potatoes were so overcooked they were inedible.
2. A Blue and Brie omelet with black beans and an English muffin.
I think there may have actually been blue cheese passed over this omelet, but none actually made it in.  My black beans looked suspiciously like potatoes.
3. Rocky Mountain Omelet..... made correctly !! Hooray!

Brenda is great, but the kitchen seems to be in a very automatic kind of routine.. and when you break it, chaos ensues......"}
{"text":"At the risk of making it popular and thus more busy, this is my favorite breakfast spot in the NE Valley for their combo of great food, solid value and nice ambiance (thanks to a recent remodel with the joining of First Watch). My favorite dish in the entire Valley is here--the Power Breakfast Quinoa Bowl, with eggs, Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes and kale. Seriously, try it. Service is great, too, and there's never the wait you get at other places. Big fan."}
{"text":"Service was okay.  The coffee was horrible.  Pancakes     the worst I've ever had.  Outside seating is nice."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch.
Now owned by first watch- totally redone, nice & fresh . Cute atmosphere!
Food is great as well as wonderful service .
Inside or patio seating outside ."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service. Laura I believe her name is should not be in a customer service type job. My family and I go there often and she is very short w us, gives us attitude, and is just a flat out mean lady. I was in there about a week ago and my omelet was missing the main ingredient in it, I was looking and waiting for a good ten minutes trying to locate our server, and when I spotted her she was eating in the main dining room! I'm sorry but if you are working and you have tables you should not be eating! She never checked back on us, and when my dad finally got her attention, she made a sound like she was annoyed we even asked her, and annoyed we interrupted her lunch! I really have never experienced a server like that in my life."}
{"text":"The service was so poor, I was about ready to call for delivery from Jack in the Box. Waiter offered lame excuses for his and the kitchen's slow service, citing that he had to wait the tables outside.  There was one couple outside!.  The place wasn't busy.  No excuse.  When the food arrived it was adequate.  Avoid this location if you have things you need to get done during the day, as you will be there awhile. Great menu, but you need to go to another location that believes in customer service."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! They said if you want real eggs you have to ask them. Very confusing why the name is the good egg if they do not even serve real eggs."}
{"text":"This location is back sliding.
I've been going here for the past nine years.

The Wait Staff is OK, however, dosen't hold a candle to the 
Wait Staff of yore.

Prices are sky rocketing here.
Totally out-of-control.
\"Good Egg\", your food is good, but, overpriced.

We live five blocks from this location.
The closest IHOP is two miles away (raintree & the 101).

If its Tuesday, we'll eat at the Good Egg.
Tuesday, is double punch card day.

Any other day we head for Ihop."}
{"text":"Fresh, organic country potatoes and pancakes made just how I wanted them. So delicious, two thumbs up to the good egg!"}
{"text":"I love this place--have been coming to this branch since the week it opened in 1996--and I'm really concerned that the recent changes are going to kill it off.  The menu is half the size it used to be.  Most of my favorite choices are gone.  Heck, they don't even carry GREEN PEPPERS any more!  Calorie counts are no longer listed, even though the website claims they are.  There seems to have been a lot of staff turnover, and even though everyone is consistently very nice & very accommodating, they don't seem to stay long.  The birthday coupons have disappeared and the takeout cups are now downright miserly.  Today's meal was ok--a little slower, a little less hot & a little less exciting, but passable.  I'll go back.  But this place used to be a crown jewel, and now it's just ordinary."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast take out over the weekend. They have a huge selection of interesting breakfast dishes which is nice. 

I had the french toast, bacon, small order of potatoes, and split some sausage with my husband. He had the Old Pueblo. 

French toast was great, fairly thick with a light touch of cinnamon. I loved the strawberry topping they included on the side and I usually steer clear of fruit toppings. Potatoes were delicious, a mix of crispy and not so crispy with nicely cooked onions and a great flavor - I'm the salt and pepper queen and they didn't need either. Bacon (well done) was also very good. Sausage was delicious, had a great maple flavor. 

Husband liked the Old Pueblo but his eggs over easy were not runny enough. 

They forgot to include my biscuit in the order but I'll let it slide this time."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this Good Egg location many times and we've always had a good experience.  We always ask for Tim, because he's the best, he doesn't blink when I modify my order (which is always...I'm kinda picky).  We go there several times a month and the punch card is the bomb.    Keep up the good work!!  Thanks Tim!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of seven and stopped for a late lunch. The service was nice, but terribly slow. It took 45 minutes to get our food with no explanation or apology. The food was good and the prices were more than reasonable. The outdoor patio was great, though the a number of birds enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! Great food but it's almost not worth going there because the service is so aggravating. We started off sitting on the patio and waiting for 15 minutes before we had to go ask one of the many servers that kept passing by us for a waitress to help us. Finally someone came over and we put in our order however what I ordered they ran out of some of the ingredients so we made sure that was acceptable (what I am going to say, no? I don't have a menu anymore). Once we got our food my mothers was cold and wasn't right. Also our table setting were missing so we had to go to the other area and grab some off of another table. Another 10 minutes later the waitress came back and by that time we were almost done and asked for the check so we could get out of this place! Huge disappointment! Don't go!!!"}
{"text":"This is my GO TO favorite breakfast restaurant!!! I love this place!! My FAVORITE breakfast is the Veggie-X. I customize it to have egg whites over black beans with diced grilled chicken and no cheese and made with spray. They are so accommodating with special requests. In the past few months, this particular location has really become a stand-out. My family is always happy with the service, the food and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for years and this was the WORST experience we ever had!
The main problem was inconsistent and nonexistent service. Sometimes there was a hostess, other times there were absolutely NO EMPLOYEES on the floor at all! Too many employees huddled for long periods in the kitchen.
Our server, Piper P , seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else. Maybe it was her first shift on the job, but she needs to be engaged with those she is serving. She only checked back with us once and we were never asked if we wanted water. I had to grab setups and salt from another table. Piper was nowhere to be seen most of the time.
The coffee here was terrible as well, no taste, just bitter. We also spent 10 minutes staring at the table across from us with dirty plates on it, until finally bussed by someone.
Overall, a horrible experience on June 20, at 1 pm."}
{"text":"The Good Egg is the perfect place to go when you have a hankering for tasty breakfast that won't keep you feeling guilty until dinner. Their menu includes lots of veggie-friendly/gluten-free options, but also appeals to meat lovers. (They have everyone covered.)

I love the veggie skillet with extra cheese. It's a must order. Naomi Garnice gives this place two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have been to Good Egg a few times now and have had excellent service and food every time I've been in. Yesterday (mother's day) my husband and I decided to grab a bite to eat there on our way further into Scottsdale. They were packed but were doing a good job with their service until a table of about 8 or 9 people decided that their food wasn't good enough. The first person complained of their ham LOOKING like \"shoe leather.\" She never even tasted it and I saw it...looked like ham to me! Then about 10 minutes later another person complained of their potatoes being \"too dry\". About another ten minutes go by and yet another person complains of their bacon being too crispy and not limp enough. Then the complaints about the most ridiculous things just came one after another even though every single time they were very accommodating. They wasted a lot of food.

The manager came and tried to help and it wasn't good enough and the owner came and tried to figure it out and help them and it still wasn't good enough until they heard they were getting their meal for free.

But the point of this is to say that even though all that was going on our waitress was still amazing and apologetic for the delay (which wasn't a bad delay at all). I mean, don't get me wrong there was a wait but it was Mother's Day and there were a lot of tables of more than 5 people. We went into it knowing there would be a wait and they even said up front there would be a bit of a wait.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute, it almost makes me ill. Reminds me of some Grandmother's house in bucolic Iowa or something... Lace, ducks, yellow walls, baskets and flowers. Yet, despite the kitschy decor, the food is fresh, service is great, and the place has a cozy atmosphere. Prices are fair; not cheap, but not over the top expensive either."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast around!! Amazing omelets  and friendly staff. Lori and the rest of the crew do a great job at making you feel welcome as soon as you walk in the door. Nothing bad to say about The Good Egg! Love it"}
{"text":"Usually great food and great service.  For some reason, we caught them on an off day because our waitress was more interested in talking to her co-worker at the counter than taking our order. Kind of disappointing. Also, I'd checked in on Twitter and with that, you score a cinnamon roll. Kinda nice, huh?  Except our waitress had no idea what to do and told us to let the cashier know when we left.   Uh...OK....

We'll go back but we sure to get a different waitress next time.  Good food, good location, and mostly good staff."}
{"text":"I love the good egg because after a late night of partying I can wake up with a hangover and walk to the good egg because I live that close and grab some breakfast.   I especially love the egg muffins with blackberry jam and cottage cheese.   Odd combination but delicious.   the service is pretty much terrible everytime I go.   But I can stand it...I guess after coming for so long you just become used to it.  Haha.  Weird I know...    The best part of the Good EGG.   There is never a wait.    Even on a weekend the wait may be for 5 minutes.   It's just never jammed packed.   I don't know why that is.     Their protein shakes are the best.   I don't know how they make them but they come out just right.    Fruit salads are great.    Pancakes are decent.   Coffee is really good.   And the patio is great.   If you don't like it the 1st time you'll probably like it the second time."}
{"text":"Used to regularly enjoy this spot, but the service has been somewhat lacking as of late. This morning, we were promptly seated and then completely ignored while service staff did things like count money and reset tables. We left without ever being acknowledged."}
{"text":"The description says this restaurant has waiter service ... I beg to differ.  That's all I have to say about this one."}
{"text":"I like this location. Plenty of room, plenty of servers.  The food was good and came quickly. The service was great."}
{"text":"Ugh!  We normally come here for breakfast which is good, but made the mistake of having lunch.  WOW, what a disappointment!

We both ordered salads and ice tea.  It came with wilted lettuce that seemed to have it's strawberry dressing tossed hours earlier.  The portions were minuscule which we didn't finish.   The tab came to $24.76.  Ouch!

So, skip the lunch and keep to the breakfast menu.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"Always a place for great breakfasts.  Service is great and servers have a friendly smile even at seven in the AM!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long hike. Good food but very much so your standard breakfast joint. Expect the classics to be just that - served very classic. Our waitress was quick and polite. The coffee was outstanding and plentiful. Great spot if you just want a good old breakfast."}
{"text":"Love the interior decor and the host was super friendly... But that is the ONLY good thing to say about this place... I never leave any sort of reviews, but this was by far one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had.  Our server must have been having a bad day or something.  We were greeted by her with a \"what do you want to drink\"... No \"hello\", No \"how are you\", No \"I'm so and so\"...Poor service all around.  The food took 45 minutes to come out and was completely cold.  The potatoes were undercooked, and there was a hair on the bacon.  We were so fed up with the place, that we stopped eating and didn't even ask for them to make us a new dish; we just wanted to get out of there.  We tried to pay and had to sit there for another 20 minutes waiting for our server to take our payment...

Its absolutely unacceptable for a breakfast experience to take an hour and a half and cost $31 for 2 people with poor quality food and service.  We will never come back to this place; rather go to Chompies down the road, which has much better food and service."}
{"text":"Have dined here numerous times and my food has always been wonderful! The waitresses have all been very friendly and efficient!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always freshly prepared and egg-cellent! Service is always on point and they offer new menu items often. My only complaint is that we went with a group of 8 people on our most recent visit and we all ordered an entree. We had a punch card, which allows you a free entree for every 7 you purchase and they wouldn't let us redeem it until our next visit. Kinda crappy but it's not a huge deal I guess."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with the family.  Three of the four plates were served cold.  The fourth was forgotten entirely.  

The wait staff was very nice and did try to make amends though. 

The fresh apple juice was excellent."}
{"text":"We ate there in January and the staff is rude and slow! We thought that we would give it another try on the way to work today and OMG!
Walked in this morning and it stunk to high heaven!!!!!!! The hostess was not nice whatsoever. We sat for a minute and just couldn't stand the smell so we walked out.
We have eaten at other locations and love the food and service. But not at this one."}
{"text":"My wife and I both get the skillet. I recommend the hog wild skillet w/ potatos on the bottom, it is AMAZING... The service was great,  Michael knowledgeable and accommodating. We will no doubt be back to this Good Egg soon."}
{"text":"Should be renamed The Bad Egg. 

It takes a lot of dissatisfaction for me to warrant a 1 star for a restaurant. To start, we were quoted a 15 to 20 min wait, which ended up being a little over 30 minutes. There were a lot of people waiting, all the while there were plenty of open tables. Didn't make any sense. 

I ordered the half BLTA sandwich and half kale salad. BF ordered the oatmeal, and we ordered a chocolate chip pancake for the little one. It took 45 minutes to get our food. Probably the longest I have ever waited at any restaurant for food, and this was a small simple order! The server was nice, even though there was no apology or explanation for was super slow service. My kale salad had no kale, just mixed greens that were pretty wilted. The sandwich was good, but not worth the wait. Boyfriend's oatmeal was cold. Server offered a Dr.Pepper in a to go cup after dropping offer the bill, which we said we wanted. Waited awhile but she never came back.

Not sure how this place stays open, maybe they were just having a really bad day. Regardless, there are plenty of better places to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"My kids love the food. Unfortunately, they did away with the flavored coffee which is the reason I go. They also raised the prices and did away with the dollar sides. With below average coffee I won't be going back. There are too many breakfast places in town to choose from where you can get great food and great coffee."}
{"text":"Love the choices...especially on the healthily side...I am so tired of being restricted to \"one-healthy\" breakfast.  All the veggies were fresh and crisp in my omelets...nice up sell with the dollar sides...sometime you just need a little bit of pancakes...so that was good...More attention to detail their side stations are un kept...so if you are facing one, like I was...you are forced to look at an unappealing and un appetizing view...glad to have a place dedicated to breakfast in the hood!"}
{"text":"\"No coffee, pancakes, or French toast today.\" What? 

I took my friend who was visiting from out of town here for breakfast on February 17. We were greated by the waitress who asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out. Definitely outside. It was nice out! \"No coffee, pancakes,or French toast today.\" The power had gone out. But there might be some leftover free coffee from earlier that morning in the big outdoor container. There was... AND nice LITTLE styrofoam cups. OK- SO NOT the best initial experience..and NO compensation offered.

We  laughed it off and didn't let that stop us from having a nice breakfast and reunion. My eggs were too runny for my liking, but that's probably my fault for not asking for them easy over.Other than that, all was well. We discovered the bathroom lights were also out. My friend used her cell phone for light. haha.

I won't let this experience stop me from coming back if in the area again. It can't be like this every day....can it?"}
{"text":"We have breakfast here on Sundays after church.  One of my favorite dishes is the low calorie Power House Burrito (6 Egg Whites, Chicken Breast, Bell Peppers, Chile Peppers, Pico de Gallo, 300 calories), $10.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-scottsdale-7?select=pydMTD8XrHB7urd0dZWh0Q#pydMTD8XrHB7urd0dZWh0Q

I can't believe this thing is only 300 calories!  However, I think it's legit because despite it's size, I don't leave the restaurant feeling stuffed....just satisfied.

The servers here are really friendly and always on top of their game.  That's why we come here frequently.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I love the food at The Good Egg, but the servers at this NoSco location are all a bunch of bitches. They have no manners or conversational skills. I know everyone has bad days, but this has been the case every time for the past 5 years. 

If you don't enjoy your job, find a new one."}
{"text":"I've been to better breakfast joints!  However, the service has always been good and it's close to our house.  The food is nothing to write home about.  The eggs benedict are decent and the omelets so, so.   However the hog wild skillet breakfast is quite tasty!"}
{"text":"3rd visit

Today we had

1) The egg white & 7 veggie omelette. 

-- Positives: Good flavor and portion size. Well seasoned. Great healthy choice

-- Negatives: presentation is not great. Did not look appetizing. Big plate... Everything white. Look empty ... Makes you feel like you did not get value for the money.

*** Suggestion: add a component to the plate that is colorful.

2) Macho Nacho! Skillet dish with potatoes, pulled beef, egg, sour cream and sauce.

-- Positives: Great presentation and good flavor. Looks appealing and value for the money.

-- Negatives: Not enough of the sauce. Sour cream comes piled on.

-- Suggestions: put sour cream and extra sauce on the side. Many people may not want or like sour cream. And then send it back and you lose money and leave a bad taste in the customers mouth :) ( yes... Pun intended )

3) Love the whole grain pancakes. I order the \"real\" maple syrup.. But was not tasty. Better flavor from the fake stuff :)

4)) Service was great today. ! Great staff... Very friendly.

 But there was an inconsistency

-- Previously on my visits when I ordered Tea. I had a plate with lemon and honey.  No plate to put my teabag and no lemon or honey.

The owner Mark has been really great with follow up and really listening to suggestions and trying to improve the customer experience and food quality.

Still ended up with $30 bill for breakfast"}
{"text":"The only place I can trust for a quick breakfast since I live down the street. Friendly environment, great workers and great food."}
{"text":"I received a very nice email from the manager who expressed his regrets about the problems my family and I experienced, and invited us to return after he personally took care of the fly issue. We did return in early November, but as the weather was really nice we sat outside. FWIW there were no flies outside. The service was OK at best. We were first asked for a drink order from 3 different servers, yet it took 15 min to get our drinks (tea, soda). It was just a little strange. Different people take the order, serve it, and clear the table although the person who took the order did stop by to ask if everything was ok."}
{"text":"Had some down time today, so granted a bit of it as \"me time\" and took myself to lunch (probably the best lunch date I've had in a while). Picked the Good Egg simply because we always thought it was cute and it was close to where I was.

Had an egg salad sandwhich on their white bread (which was a buttermilk bread). VERY good egg salad (egg salad grosses my husband out, so I'm not allowed to have it at home - always excited to see it on a menu). And the buttermilk bread was super duper good!

The waitress was a little very sweet and did a great job. She saw I was reading and was respectful of that.

Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a salad to go a chef salad. Was told it was no longer on the menu but they could still make it. Express that all I wanted was Turkey, bacon, ham, egg and cucumber. But when I went to pick up my salad I received everything else but what I wanted mushrooms, broccoli, raw zucchini it was not a very good salad and it was warm. I was very unhappy not sure I'll go there again. Always have problems when I do pick up orders. It's sad because there's never anybody in there so why can't the orders be right."}
{"text":"This is the first time we have been at a Good Egg in years.  There was not wait whatsoever and the place was packed on a Saturday morning.  I did not understand why they would charge  $1.50 for a small side of sour cream or horse radish sauce, this does not make sense.  The food was just okay nothing to write home about and their pancakes well a disappointment.  They are okay, but I usually like to eat my pancakes with just butter no syrup or honey, these were very dry and I can not cut them with just a fork needed a knife which speaks volumes....

The prices are good some low some high....the ladies bathroom has no a/c so prepare to sweat like a sauna if you use it.  We might go back to try for lunch...but the extra charge for the sour cream and other sauce left a bad taste in my mouth....maybe some of the other ones have better food.  the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"The service is below average, the food is ok definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Eat here twice in the past 2 weeks for breakfast and each time the eggs and bacon came out super cold, you would think a breakfast place with be able to serve your eggs and bacon at least warm....so if you like cold eggs...this is your place"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Shannon W this time. The name says it is the good egg, the reality is, its just an egg. It is slightly friendlier than a Denny's, but there is really no reason to go out of your way to find a location or even bother to eat here. the Hollandaise sauce is disgusting, and the ham needs to be sliced much. much thinner, the eggs benedict should be avoided. It is what it is. There are better places to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Prices keep going up and up and the portion size and quality keep going down. 
We have been eating that this particular good egg for over 10 years. We have seen the place change drastically over the past 12-24 months.
The other day I ordered 2 strawberry pancakes. They used to be the full size of the plate and very fluffy. When they came out and were 2\" all around smaller and flat as a crape, I made a casual comment to the food server about the size. Her answer was that most people waste them so they cut the size... But they didn't cut the price.
I ordered corned beef hash and eggs. There was like a measured spoon full of corned beef hash, what was probably one scrambled egg (small, not even a jumbo) and potatoes. Hash was cold, eggs cold. Oh well, after all, it was double stamp Tuesday!
This is just typical of what is going on there. We used to eat there a minimum of 2-3 times a week, now it is just an occasional double stamp Tuesday. 
In the area there are lots and lots of better places for less money, especially if you use Groupon, Restaurant.com or the entertainment book.
On a side note, this place used to be crowded. We used to have to wait to be seated., Especially on a Tuesday. Now the place is always empty. 7 or 8 tables occupied. Maybe I am not the only one who feels this way???
We will probably use up our free meals from the loyalty cards and move on to the better establishments in the area. My wife says we better use them fast or they won't be worth anything!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food... Denny's is better and a lot better deal. Internet does not ever work .Waitress although was great ... Won't go back .."}
{"text":"They should call it The Cold Egg.  I went there twice last week and all the eggs were cold.  The saving grace is that the pancakes are awesome.  I cannot remember better pancakes."}
{"text":"The Good Egg doesn't exactly live up to its name. While it's nowhere near bad, I wouldn't exactly call it good either. How about The 'Eh' Egg or The Decent Egg?  That's better. I've been here twice and had the veggie omelette on one occasion and some traditional breakfast on another (okay, it was just this morning). The service was good but if you're looking to have a really great breakfast, there's other, better places to go."}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot to go grab a good breakfast. The food isn't extraordinary, but it is good. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I was a fan of The Good Egg for a long time.  But that was probably because I was going to the one at Scottsdale Road and Carefree Hwy.  
This location, which happens to be a mile from my house, is one that I have frequented the last few months.  And EVERY time I'm there, the service is horrific, starting as you enter the place. I never reviewed it because I felt a loyalty to the other store.  But today was the last straw.  
I went for lunch and ordered something that I've ordered 20 times before, the santa fe straw sandwich.  The place had a total of 4 tables occupied when I got there and it took 18 minutes to get an iced tea.  When the sandwich arrived it was on this tiny little soggy bread and looked NOTHING like what it usually does.  There was also a rotten/brown piece of pineapple as a garnish...wth??? 
I asked the waiter, (who apparently won the personality of the year award), and he said they ran out of bread and were waiting on the \"bread guy.\"  Piece of advice, you might want to tell the customer that, prior to accepting their order.  I was annoyed, but ate it anyway.  I ran out of tea prior to finishing the meal and of course the waiter never came back.  As I sat there fuming, hoping to get someone's attention, he came back and said, \"we are selling these discount coupons for charity, did you want to buy one?\"  EPIC FAIL Mr Personality!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very close for my girlfriend and I so we visit here pretty frequently. This place has a great menu and kind of a Midwest feel based on the decor (way to update the decor in which it looks great). The service on the other hand can be kind of slow at times which this place wasn't busy the last time we went. Our server was very friendly and pleasant when waiting on us. He looked a little nervous in which this could possibly be his first serving job? Overall experience was good and the food is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We ordered drinks and after 10 minutes, a server came by and said the previous server got busy & asked us again what we wanted to drink.  Not the first time service has been less than average!"}
{"text":"Eggs any way you can imagine.  Avoid the hollandaise sauce, its not good.  Other than that, decent breakfast.  Theres really no better way to kick off your hot sweaty day in AZ than with eating."}
{"text":"Have been there on several different occasions and must say....each time was the same......
TERRIBLE service with very unfriendly waitresses and staff. 
I will never go back again.  
There are much better choices around (like IHOP) that make it a much more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for breakfast, food is always good, servers are friendly and it's a great value. You can't go wrong for breakfast at the GoodEgg"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! And fantastic service!
Ask to be seated in laura's  section ... She knows her stuff and Has alot of knowledge on the food!!! Try bacon pancakes!!! It's really good!!"}
{"text":"They call this fine establishment The Good Egg.  Not A Good Egg.  Nay!  It's The Good Egg!

Let me give my fans the backstory of this review.  Ahem...

I use to Live with a 63 year old man I refer to as Smoky Joe.  Now this guy is old...like older than 15 presidents...that's old.  

He'd teach me bout the whereabouts of aliens, how they visit us on Earth and why we need to find peace within the world in order for these intelligent lifeforms to finally reveal themselves.  

He was also the best d#%m cook that I'd ever had the luxury of trying.  From fish with cheese perfectly flexed in the center to ribs that were so tangy and juicy that the meat would literally slip off the bone.  He knew his stuff.

Now we'd always go to this spot on Saturdays to catch up on my craziness as he'd cut out coupons for Albertsons and Fry's coldcuts (Albertsons coldcuts are a joke).  

During this weekly event I'd always order the, Say Cheese, and play around with the options available to be put into my omelets (bacon, sausage, chicken, broccoli, etc).  He'd go for a single blueberry pancake and would smoke his cigs in between the wait time.

Wed enjoy some coffee and the fine service of the woman (no babes here, just strong independent woman.  Lets go!)

Overall the service was consistent.  The staff would get us some solid deals with their stamp deals per entrees and they'd treat us to hot hot coffee.  

Other times they'd make a few mistakes, but all is forgiven if they'd hire more babes.  

Here's to use good egg...you r The Good Egg

{"text":"Always a great meal.  Love the Bacado. Good to see that they have fresh juices.  Got the carrot ginger. DEEELISH!"}
{"text":"I am actually very surprised at all the poor reviews for this place.  I have been a half dozen times if not more and it's always been great.  Their eggs are great (important for an establishment with their title) and I do have a thing for their toast as well.  It is always busy when I arrive (late breakfast time), but the waits aren't usually too long and the staff is always very friendly.  It has a nice atmosphere as well, and seems very family oriented.  I know I will keep coming back for their scrambled eggs!"}
