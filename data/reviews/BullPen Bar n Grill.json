{"text":"Food ok....bit under staffed.....ok place ..service was a bit slow...might just be a bad day....ill try again....great tv  everywhere...Brittney was great!"}
{"text":"I understand peak hours and being busy during main events but waiting an hour for any sort of service at a table is ridiculous. There's 3 people working during a packed event. Horrible service. Never coming back."}
{"text":"2nd time, went to give the benefit of doubt since they were new..ordered dry rub wings out, cold draft beer out of mugs, bartender had no problem swearing with customers. Hour half later wings were almost frozen when served. Didn't want to get food poisoning. Too bad, the place had potential."}
{"text":"Been in twice for after work drinks, both times completely dead.  The first time the bartender didn't know how to make my drink, the second they were out of absolute and Jim Beam.  I really don't see it staying in business. 
Plus side, prices are okay"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour or with the family.  Definitely something for everyone.  We have tried the burgers, sliders, buffalo shrimp, waffle battered wings, cheese curds, and more.... all delicious!  Kiddos love the food and desserts.  Great service and ICE COLD beers.  Great place to make it your weekly hang out or happy hour.  Family of 5 gives it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably would be best if you wait a few months to see if this new place can get it together. Ordered a couple beers and an order of nachos and wings. One hour wait and still no food. Gave up waiting, paid for beers and left."}
{"text":"I decided to read all of the reviews before writing my own. I had already created my own opinion of the place but after reading the reviews and seeing so many with similar experiences I cannot believe that they still haven't fixed these common problems. I work in a restaurant and have worked many positions including management and work very closely with owners who run multiple successful restaurants.

     We live down the street and watched it being built. (Thinking I can't wait to have a Good bar & grill so close to home. It took us a little longer to finally getting around to trying it...) Finally. As we walked in the door I was actually in Wow, it was much nicer than I had expected. Which made me hope it was going to be that much better!  The atmosphere was good, lots of tvs with sports and music videos. 

     There were no seat yourself signs, so we waited. We stood at the door for a minute or two before someone finally realized we were there and greeted us. We sat in a booth in the bar area as it was pretty dead for a Saturday night. She got our drink order, left and returned with our beers quite quickly. At this point we had asked for a few mins, she returned and took our order. We were the only people ordering food in the restaurant! Over 25 mins later, no more beer and no service (Our server was busy talking with a couple at the bar. The other 2 servers on duty also just talking with guests... keep in mind about the only 8 other guests in the restaurant at this time.) Our food finally shows, we order another round, we have no silverware or napkins. At this point I'm just glad to have food and drink in front of me. 

     We ordered the Pulled Pork sliders, that only comes with French fries (no substitutions?) and the Torta with the \"homemade tator tots\". The food was good, minus the tator tots and it only came with 5 of them??? They were too dense, not what you expect from a tator tot. 

     With all of this being said, I wasn't too pleased with the service. The servers were just hanging out as if they were also guests. Did not see any management or owners. We were not greeted promptly enough considering no signs. The food was good but the tator tots need help. I'm really hoping this place can pull it together cause I'd like to see it stay. I'll give it a few weeks or months before I'll give it 1 more try. Until then, I wish them the best! 

    2 stars because the food was decent but the service was terrible. It's not wrong to expect good food and service when you pay to go eat!"}
{"text":"For a newly opened business they are good.  Focus on simple menu but really good food. The wings are cooked to perfection with many different flavors...not like all the rest.You have to try the Waffle Battered Wings...they are huge and yummy.

The staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"This place is the awesome!!! Cuban sliders!!!! Yessnesss!!!my favorite sandwich hands down! Chadnesss"}
{"text":"I would frequent Bull Pen in the past, but have not been in there in several months. I ordered a couple of adult beverages as well as a dozen of wings. I got half peach and the other half honey. The wings were very small and very very dry. Not up to what I was accustomed to in the past.
Only got thing in addition to the cold beer was Amber the server was awesome."}
{"text":"Food and prices are decent but the service is AWFUL! It took 20 minutes to have 2 beers brought to us and then we had to ask for food menus. It was not busy in the place at all so there really is no excuse. Once we were finally able to order our food, about 45 minutes after being there, it took about another 25 to get an order of chicken tenders and fries delivered. Hopefully this place can get it together, but we will never go back based on the service."}
{"text":"Walked out. Its hard to explain how bad the service was. Took over 10 minutes for the waitress to make her way over, and it was not busy when we went. 20 minutes later we left before our drinks were even ready at the bar. Several people around us were served quickly when they sat down. I can't attest to the food because we didn't get that far. This place won't make it very long, but I wouldn't come back even if it did."}
{"text":"So the first 2 times we came it was absolutely terrible.. we decided to give it one last time and are so happy we did! Kelly was absolutely amazing! She was able to remember our order and quick to refill our drinks. Thank you Kelly for a good Friday night out! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant 3 times. All three times, they have fallen short. My last time was last night. I took my kids there for dinner. First the beer I ordered tasted so weird... something was wrong with it... then we ordered wings. The wings were okay. Some were good, some were very weird shapes... then we ordered queso dip... the chips were good the queso was Luke warm... we ordered BBQ chicken fries... I had some paper stuck to my chicken... gross. The service was equally terrible. Another server filled my sons drink and brought us plates... our server walked past us with empty drinks multiple times and plates piled high on the table. She didn't take any of the dirty plates until she brought our last dish, the fries and didn't have room on the table to put the fries down... so I had to move everything to make room and she finally took the plates away... 

It's sad that the food and service is ruining this place because it's a great location and the bar looks great. They have a lot of TVs which is great for sports... but the lack of service and crummy food will kill this place..."}
{"text":"The tater tots are made in house and very tasty.  I enjoyed the nachos with the carne asada.  My wife had a hamburger and completely enjoyed it.  This place has not been opened long, but it definitely worth a try.
Oh, and there are 12 beers on tap, and the staff is very nice. Ask for Rebecca or Steph, they are the best."}
{"text":"Great service and damn good food! Try out that ice bar. Keep your beer cold at all times. Oh yea! I forgot to mention the pretty ladies that are waiting on you at all times."}
{"text":"I had been here one other time and it was good. This time it was terrible. I got a hamburger which was OK, but my husband ordered the Cuban and it was TERRIBLE. The buns were hard and the meat was dry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This bar has growing pains but the waitresses are amazing! The food is even more amazing!! Give it a try!!! Be patient!!! The food is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"In an effort to try and help this ownership and restaurant out, I created a Yelp account to leave just this review.  I live across the street from this business and really want them to succeed.

The food is tolerable.  The staff is horrendous.  A great place to start would be to have to service standards.  Better response time from servers, no cell phones, and a clean restroom are easy things to implement.  Ask your female customers how important a clean restroom is to them.

On the topic of female customers, there are hardly any.  Your staff is saturated with young ladies that attract the same profile of male customer to hang out and gossip with the servers.  Your customers touch on that several times in your reviews.  It's a fact you're losing customers because of this dynamic.  The owner(s) can think about this review the next time they see a patron walk in, look around, and immediately leave the next time.

Ditch the cliche 80's rock music on the radio and tvs.  It's the same 10 songs and your repeat customers and employees are tired of it.  Either empower your customers to select appropriate-tasted music, or have a variety that keeps the consumer and your staff energized.

In the end, the consumer will decide who's in business in 5 years.  This staff has a smash-and-grab attitude and have no regard for the ownerships potential prosperity.  Quite frankly, they run this restaurant and your reviews consistently suggest that.

Reviews are a window into the customer's mind.  I'm not interested in threats from the ownership via yelp after I post this.  I will simply wait until change is affected or it's a new bar in 2 years.

If the management uses this feedback right, it will help the business out!"}
{"text":"Smells like sewer, bar is not stocked, service sucks, one waitress who hides in the back, always out of certain food, 45 minutes to get a shitty slider and some wings! Do not go here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the bullpen and it stunk literally stunk like a sewer. It was dead and there was probably only 9 people at the place with probably 10 waitresses running around. However that made the service really good. There was no pool tables nor were there any foosbal tables. I sucked seeing this gigantic space empty."}
{"text":"Nice new sports bar on Power near south of baseline!  Lots of tv's and action.  Well drinks are $3.25, shelf $5.00.   Not bad!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!
I followed a server in who's shift started at 5pm. She finally asked if I needed help at 5:25 pm. I asked for a manager and she said \"we have a cook!\" WTF???
I got my drink at 5:30. 
I'm just offended lol
Bars are bars, bit this is Reeeedic!!!
\"We have a cook\"??????
I'm still laughing."}
{"text":"We waited almost 45 minutes for a tiny sandwich that doesn't even come with a side. And not once in that 45 minutes did anyone check on us to see if we needed refills or tell us we hadn't been totally forgotten."}
{"text":"Came here the other night to try a new local place with my parents and was highly disappointed and even appalled. First off the place seemed closed at first and when we went inside no one greeted us but two wanna be cowboys who were weirdly staring us down at the bar, almost seemed like they wanted a fight even though both my parents are in their sixties and I'm on the small end and a young girl (very weird to say the least). 
We sat ourselves and a waitress got our drink order pretty quickly and it didn't take long for us to order. As we waited for our food I noticed the workers on their phones, sitting at tables, and at one point the man I presumed the chef by his chef jacket just wondering around joking with the other workers. I understand the place was nearly empty but in my experience in food/ customer service there is always something to clean or do. We found this all to be really odd. 

So we got our food in a reasonable manner, even with the chef just wondering about , and we're thoroughly disappointed at what we were served. My mom got the tri tip sliders and the meat was very tough, I got the burger and the patty looked like it went through a hydraulic press just no juices or flavor and had to saw through it to get a bite, my dad got the tacos and his meat too was dry and no flavor. My mom asked for some mayonnaise and the waitress brought back a little container with none other than a fly in it. We alerted the waitress who looked unconcerned and slightly confused why the complaint, but still brought out a new one, but at that point we no longer wanted to eat since we questioned the hygiene of the place. So we quickly asked for the bill and scurried off to warn others to never entered this place. 

It's really a shame because the bar is beautiful and they could probably make some good money but damn that food was disgusting. I seriously felt like Gordon Ramsey on kitchen nightmares and wanted to shout out everything that was wrong. The only positive things I can say about this place are the fries are good and our waitress seemed to try, even though her coworkers were quite the opposite."}
{"text":"More than disappointed time and time again. I work in the same complex so I have tried quite a few things of the menu. I've had burned onion rings. Chicken wings that were sooo spicy I couldn't eat them. I ordered medium because they don't offer a mild. It was not medium. They were hot like fire! When I got the burned onion rings the waitress that answered the phone was arguing with me about the order instead of offering to fix it. They skimp on sauce when they feel like it. Sometimes I'll get a full container and sometimes they half ass it and give me very little. I got an order of chicken nachos the other day that were delicious, they had plenty of toppings and really tasty cheese sauce all over them.  Well I wanted to get them again today and was pissed to have paid 11 dollars for some chips! Barely any cheese at all. All I gotta say now is I won't be eating there any more."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Not big enough to handle a busy night. Waited over 2 hours for our food. Their business is ran ass backwards."}
{"text":"Kelly has been amazing. I walked here and am so happy I did. Awesome food. Great service with Kelly! Definitely get the cheese curds!!!"}
{"text":"Music is awful.
Bush and nirvana at 8pm? 
Makes me want to sleep.
Thought this was a country bar. 
I don't have to comment on food. 
Check my photo...try and find the chicken on that bun lol
Stick to cogs you'll be happier."}
{"text":"Bullpen lool....Bullsh** !! 11 or 12 total people in the ENTIRE bar/rest. I sat at the bar, just feet down the rail from the bartender, OVER 10 minutes and watched the female bartender talk and laugh to 2 customers/friends about B.S. Didn't even acknowledge my existence since walking in....getting  annoyed, two other customers, who must be regulars walk in and before they even sat down at the bar beyond me, she had menus in front of them. Walked out of this joke of a bar after saying something. Apparently service is still warming up in the Bullpen here."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.. The food & the service were equally bad. I tried the waffle covered wings and they were horrible..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was great. I have a feeling they have read their reviews as I see a \"seat yourself\" sign and new waitresses that are quick and friendly. I had pork sliders with fries and my wife had a quesadilla. They have happy hour which is a huge plus and did I mention they stream UFC free, no cover. I think this place is an up and coming legend, ya they have a few quarks to get out but what restaurant doesn't when first starting out. I'll be back for sure. Country music is also a plus but they mix it up in case you don't love country."}
{"text":"I unfortunately will not be eating here again.  The service was poor.  Under staffed in the cooking area, so it took more than an hour to get our food.  The food was okay.  I just rather spend my money on a more quality restaurant."}
{"text":"My thoughts are gonna be all over the place so bear with me:

First and foremost, if you aren't a regular you will be looked at and you will feel like you're being judged which you probably are. 

A friend recommended Bullpen to me because they offer free UFC fights. I'm not a huge UFC connoisseur or anything but it's an excuse to get some friends together without spending $15 on a cover. You wouldn't have ever thought there was a UFC event on this particular night because it was not busy. This was an okay thing though because UFC fights tend to bring out the worst people in society. 

When you walk into this bar, it's spacious and feels nice. However, the hostesses or servers or whatever they are, are not near the front and you are left wandering around like a complete jackass. I literally had no idea where I was going. I would have sat at the bar and ordered a drink while I waited for my friend but it was full (Not blaming the bar for having a full bar, if anything kudos to them). But If you're solo and the bar is full, you are SOL. You will seat yourself in a massive booth, or sit alone in a deserted corner of the establishment. Besides the full bar, the rest of the place was empty. Most, if not all of the booths in the bar area appear to be made to seat parties of at least eight. Well, I definitely wasn't going to sit in a large booth even though that's where all the TVs were showing everything I wanted to watch.

In an effort to try and comfortably find a place to sit and avoid the awkwardness, I had to walk over to all of the servers or hostesses or whatever they are who are at some podium on the way to the bathrooms. It felt like I was bothering them. Like another reviewer said, yes they appeared to be gossiping and goofing around rather than trying to help a patron who is obviously in some sort of distress. They're just like \"Yaaaaaahh, uh-huh-haha! Seat yourself!\" Alas, I sat myself on an uncomfortable metal thing away from civilization at a tiny round top table. 

Anyway, the bar area is pretty, and there are plenty of TVs of many different sizes. I actually really dig the vibe and look of the bar. By bar, I mean JUST the bar, not the establishment as a whole. But my friend and I felt alienated because unless you are sitting at the bar itself (all seats occupied by macho regulars) or have a huge party, you don't really have much of a spot in the bar area. We moved from the small, wobbly table to a bigger table that was a little more appropriate. Unfortunately, moving to this spot put us smack dab in front of the TV that has messed up color and only displays things in either pink or green. Whatever, we'll settle. 

Ok, ok, ok. Not everything was bad. Actually most of it wasn't bad. As I mentioned before, the UFC was free. That is awesome. The manager for that evening engaged in conversation with us multiple times throughout the night which was cool of him. He seemed like a genuine enough guy. Our server was very attentive but I'm not sure if this is because our server was a rock star, or because of how slow they were. For the sake of this establishment, I'll go with rock star. The brew was cold so no issues there. My wings, honey hot and diablo fuego were both great. My friend said the pulled pork sliders and fries were good, too. And this bus boy, man, this guy is like a HAWK! Before your glass hits the table after that final ever-so-refreshing gulp of your favorite lager, that thing is already in the dishwasher. Gotta love it!

But seriously this place needs to get their seating in order and their whole server / hostess situation figured out. My attitude toward the place got started on the wrong foot. There needs to be an established podium up front that has at least one hostess there. Yes, even when you're slow. Also, just because your servers and hostesses have to dress like bimbos doesn't mean they actually have to act like them (airheads). This review isn't meant to slam your business it's meant to improve it. I'll be back and hopefully with a bigger group."}
{"text":"Beer was warm. 
Queso is bland, food was Eh 
Service SUCKED. Oh wait, there was no service. 

Pros: UFC fight was free. 
One guy in a blue shirt (bus boy,kitchen staff?) did end up getting us a beer"}
{"text":"Went to the Bull Pen for the first time. Really nice inside. Lots of tvs. Played a lot of old MTV music videos. Very cleaned inside nice atmosphere. Prompt greeting when we came in. Order chips and salsa which took for every. The salsa was boring and bland. Our main course took way too long as well. The burgers were good. The coleslaw was good. Asked for the burger topping on the side this was messed up and forgotten. The menu was average not very big menu. Average bar and grill. The servers were nice."}
{"text":"Nice servers and cold beer - takes forever to get your food. Makes you wonder if they cook with a hot plate and a microwave. I hope they get their act together, as I like the chill vibe of the place."}

{"text":"came to watch ufc fights. service was terrible. 45min to get drinks and an 1 hour and 30min to get food. food was terrible. they were drastically understaffed. 4 servers for 200 people. would not recommend this place to anyone. place wont be open that long any way if they continue to operate like this"}
{"text":"3rd time is a charm! Great visit to the Bullpen!!!
The server KELLY did an amazing job tonight staying on top of our orders - Presently surprised! 
The Cheese curds, Quesadilla, chicken wrap--all highly recommended by our table!"}
{"text":"Warm beer bad service waited 15 minutes for first beer not at all busy. Then sat and waited 10 minutes for second the whole time the two bar maids were talking. When I asked why it's taking so long tat gal told me to Fuck off, tat gal can keep her attitude and the warm beer never going back."}
{"text":"Great location.. great staff .. weekend crowd could be livelier.. you have enough space to pull a local band in and get some dancing going. We left to find entertainment otherwise we would have stayed."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch. The place was fairly empty. We were seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We looked at the menu, and I decided on the wings. They have several different sauces to choose from, I chose the honey bbq. My husband and I shared an order of onion rings. My wings were cooked perfectly and the sauce was very good. The onion rings were awesome! There are a ton of TV's in there which will be great during football season. The decor is typical sports bar. Prices are reasonable. Will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"WAFFLE BATTERED WINGS!!!!!!!
Ok, got that out of my system, but stellar idea. Keeping in mind that this restaurant is brand spankin new, with only a few days under it's belt, we are so happy to have another restaurant close to home for our (hate to admit) weekly burger and beer fix. We were promptly seated by Angie, who also was our server. She was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the menu, which had some great choices! The manager Mark also took the time to check in frequently and asked our opinions on the food, atmosphere ect.

Atmosphere was your typical local sports bar with a country feel. Lots of tvs, but what they do differently is they not only show sports, but old school music videos--you know, like from when MTV actually had music videos. The videos provided the background music. Awesome concept!! 

We ordered an array of food to try everything. We had the Midwest cheese curds--Michigan girl here was impressed! The batter was light, the cheese was squeaky and the ranch was on point! Now back to the waffle wings. What a concept! The flavors were there of your classic chicken and waffles. My only suggestion would to season the batter and drizzle the maple sauce instead of coating the wings in sauce to keep them crispy. We also thought they needed more heat. Angie was more than accommodating and brought us some of their homemade \"Diablo sauce\"...they seriously should bottle this stuff, great heat and flavor there. We were also pleased with our sliders and buffalo chicken sandwich, but the star of the meal were the homemade tots. They would definitely get Napoleon Dynamite's approval! 

I can't wait to see what this potentially awesome bar does in the next few months. We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Server was awesome! Free fights and plenty of seating! Cheese curds are BOMB burger was good too!! I will be coming back for every PPV UFC fight! This place is dope! Great staff good food and clean spacious environment!!! And the BEST Chesse Curds I've ever had!!! Straight from Wisconsin I met the owner and they have to use a special provider just to get them!! They make Culivers curds taste like cardboard!!!"}
{"text":"Found a bug on my burger and the ditsy waitress did nothing.  Terrible food and even worse service.  For a place that's been only open for a few months they sure don't seem to want to be in business for much longer.  Good luck making it to 1 year."}
{"text":"UPDATE  THEY WERE SHUT DOWN! 
So I took my son to evaluate the place for company party 

First thing place stinks like rotten sour beer.

Before sitting down at the table there were a few women leaving,  I had asked how the food was?
 They said \" terrible actually felt sick\"! Oh...!

 Needless to say we did not eat, upon seating our selves, we met the owners, some extremely arrogant and rude people.

 of coarse cocky young Cowboys almost staring us down for a fight! Sitting at the bar, all this being said we will never step foot in this place and never recommend it to anybody I see them going out of business very soon the place was dead by the way on a weekend
So I guess if you're looking for a dirty stench filled room with Rude owners and tasteless food 
That could possibly get you sick? 
Dont forget the warm beer this is your place. 

 UPDATE:!.............!!!!  How funny 

Must be the owner or his hired muscle
Just sent me a invite through yelp 
Telling me to come say this to his face 
Wow!!! Great ownership rude in person threatening on review boards .... I guess our bad experience was not enough, now he is proven to be a bullying bar owner
What a joke!!  Hahaha."}
{"text":"Wow, brand new joint in the neighborhood and what a great place.  Food was awesome, try the fried pickles.  I had the beef sliders and my husband had a burger.  Everything was great including the service.  Had a big bar crowd, but the tables were not full.  Hope the word gets out about this place so they stick around."}
{"text":"First time I came here they were out of the alcohol I ordered, captain. So then I went for skyy vodka... out of that too. Then I came here for dinner and ordered a chicken Caesar salad. The salad is 10$ and the size of this salad is about 4$ worth. 
Curious to see how long this place will stay open. Also seems like the employees are socializing rather than working"}
{"text":"Brittany is awesome!! Attentive sweet bartender! Try her concoction with cranberry vodka pineapple and something else. Yum yum!! Cold drafts! Good daily specials too!! 

Disappointed in wings.. but quesadilla was yummy! 

Love the 80's music with videos on tv's along with every sporting event. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, super friendly staff... just a little two loud at 3 in the afternoon to hold a conversation. I will be going back however."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible.  We Never got our food.  We waited an hour and a half and finally just told our waitress we were leaving we paid for our drinks and left.. as we were leaving the manage stopped by our table to let us know our food was almost done.. no thanks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i have been searching for a good burger place for so long and FINALLY found one. I'm not sure why the negative reviews about the wait for food, our waitress was fantastic and the food came out hot and promptly. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to see a new bar in the area however, I've been there three time and haven't been impressed.  Drinks are a little pricy for Mesa area.  Food isn't bad but service can be rough at times."}
{"text":"Need some new rules.

1-  Stop standing and chatting with customers for up to 5 minutes at a time without bothering to look around at your tables.  Empty glasses and people waiting for the check (hint: your tip) were everywhere.

2- Cellphones OFF.  The bar has a phone.  Anyone can call that number in an emergency if they need you.  Your texts and emails can wait until you're done DOING YOUR JOB.

Fix it.

---------------

UPDATE!

The owner threatened me as well!   

\"Come introduce yourself we'll 'fix it' for you no problem\"... 

Our friends from Mesa PD will be having a chat."}
{"text":"The environment and decor are good.  The service is pretty good, too.  But I have been there 4 times and each time the food took forever to come out.  Today I went and got a salad.  It was the only salad choice.  It came in a small bowl and was the size of a side salad for $8.  I ate it in 5 minutes.  Kind of a joke for a salad.  

Get your kitchen and food squared away."}
{"text":"I saw on their Facebook page that today BullPen was offering a 2 for one deal on burgers today. I was all over that. I had a hard time deciding between wings or burger last time. Good thing I went with the wings so I could get the burger deal this time. 

We had the same waitress, sat in the same booth. The place had a handful of customers, so not particularly busy. As I said in my pervious review they have a few things to work on. Service is one. It's still a little slow. I ordered the Smokewagon burger. This is a double decker with bacon, Monterey Jack cheese, and jalapeño chutney on a steakhouse bun. I ordered some Diablo sauce just to kick it up a little. This order came with fries.

This was one of the best burgers I've had. The burgers were cooked perfectly. Kudos to Ryan the chef there. It was juicy and flavorful. Trying to finish it was a job. These are 2 quarter pound burgers. The fries were just ok. They were the thin cut kind, not my favorite. A little Diablo sauce made the fries interesting. 

This will go into my best burger list."}
