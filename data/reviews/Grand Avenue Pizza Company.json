{"text":"Tried this place on a weekend for a take-out order, the salad was good, but I was given two slices of pizza with paper on top of each. Paper stuck the cheese ..needless to say it wasn't very good. The pizza was also bland  & lacking taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most amazing pizza I've ever had. Jack Cook knows how to make a pie! I will never look at pizza the same. Fresh. Tasty. Unique. Incredible!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok and i appreciate the motivation to source quality ingredients but oh my god $30 for a pizza?  Noooooo...  Will stick to a slice at lunch occasionally."}
{"text":"We have a lot of great pizza near us, but grand ave is definitely my favorite! The red sauce is seriously the best"}
{"text":"Just like Grand Avenue, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. But if you have even an ounce of consumer pride, be prepared to be let down. The food ranges from below average and super expensive (pizza), to really well-priced but not always available (salad). Also, don't order a coke with the lunch special. They'll slap on an additional $1.50 beverage upcharge. But they won't tell you about it. That would make them a legitimate business.

And while the service has been ok at the counter (sort of), the men working in this joint seem to have some sort of attitude and are not all that welcoming. Which is too bad, since that's what being in a retail type business requires. Acting too cool for school just makes me want to go to...well, any place else."}
{"text":"I was at Third space with some friends listening to music and drinking, you know just having a grand ol time when I looked across the street and I saw Grand Ave Pizza...so we all decided to head over after and have a slice and let me tell you baby the pizza was AMAZING!!! Me and my buddy shared a pepperoni pizza and it was just so good. As a matter of fact I am driving over there tonight just to satisfy my craving and I don't live near there. If you are in the neighborhood (or not) take a drive...You wont be disappointed...Smooches!"}
{"text":"Ughh. So awful. 
Prices are just plain ridiculous. $18 dollars for a 12 in pizza with hardly any toppings. Seriously for that price you'd think they would load it up. Considering you pay $2/3 per topping. I got about 7 toppings on there per $2 literally. When I asked for a couple more they charged me ANOTHER $2. Really? So a crappy 12 in pizza with hardly anything on it ends up costing me $20? Haha what a joke. Then I see a guy who works there come out with a slice and his is loaded up with toppings. So they make customers pizza extremely skimpy, yet their own they make full of toppings. Rip off. Bad customer service. And honestly it's nothing special at all. So many better options with fresh ingredients for a much better price and staff who cares. Will never be back and will warn my friends as well. #rude"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been going to this place sense they first opened. We where so excited to have a pizza place open late and quite litterly down the street from our house.
The pizzas always taste amazing, the staff make you feel like family and the food is way too good!!
We actually had them cater our wedding in 2015, and they made a special just for us, and a pizza cake.
If you needed to chose a last meal,chose them. Its worth it!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time since moving to downtown and the pizza was awesome! We were in mood for anchovies ... which is easy to get wrong and become a disaster lol ... but they did it up perfect! Not fishy and not too salty, it was just right. They are also very nice and helpful. Good atmosphere and an all around great neighborhood business!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars ONLY because it is the only place to get late night food in this area code. Egregiously overpriced for what amounts to very mediocre pizza. Picture sub-Domino's quality. The owner regularly talks sh*t about phone-order customers post 12-am, but besides this OVERcharges for a plain slice of cheese (3.00) on menu, but rung up as 3.25  amounting to 3.77 w/tax.  Frankly at this rate you WILL get a better pie from a chain if you aren't too hammered to order earlier in the night."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and I can say that despite never having gone. Thank you so much (times infinity!) for making my boyfriend's little birthday surprise such a success! 

-That crazy lady from PA"}
{"text":"Wow! Loving this place. Old pizza hut lamps, cactus adorn the tables, cute patio, music, and great pizza.

Pizza by the slice is a great fast take away.

Special pies are great.
The beauty is in the mother yeast, and the sauce is very good!
Good eats till 4 am"}
{"text":"I have to say they tried hard. They went out of their usual delivery area and maybe they shouldn't have.  The pizza was smashed up against the side of the box, the dleivery guy was NOT at all pleasant, and the pizza was ice cold.  It is probably good if you eat it in the restuarant.  The worst thing about this delivery was that they didn't bring ANY plates, but waxed paper inistead.  Now this may be okay for just a slice on the run, but for a dinner with salad this was not good.  If you have to go with delivery, this might not be a good choice"}
{"text":"If you're out in Phoenix with some cravings for a great NY style slice with some seriously kickass customer service, look no farther than GAPC. 

On top of all the main ingredients one would expect to see at a pizza joint, GAPC will add and subtract some interesting ingredients depending on availability. Tonight, one ingredient stuck out to me: pickles!! Typically don't see those on the menu at a pizza place. 

The shop is located on a hip corner on Grand Ave across the street from a coffee shop and dive bar. The inside is small and quaint and they have an outdoor seating area for those nice, cool, fall nights. 

This was my second visit and each time I was very impressed with the staff. Super friendly and very welcoming, although being a paying customer probably helps! After chatting with the guy working tonight, he offered me a slice of his own dessert pizza creation while I waited for my pie to get done. Awesome! Plus it was delicious! Great fit for that post pizza sweet tooth. 

Overall, I'd say the quality of food and atmosphere earns a solid 4 but the staff gets the extra star! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fresh, delicious, and creative. Outdoor seating area is cozy and everyone who works here really made our experience. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Listen I would give this place 10 stars but unfortunately they only allow 5 stars on this particular app this is hands down the best pizza in Phoenix!!!!!! They are open late so if you are leaving the club or just getting it in this is a perfect late night meal. Attractive scenery superb culinary skills."}
{"text":"Had a late night with the besties & we stayed out longer than expected. We wanted pizza but all the major pizza chains were closed by the time we got home. Yelped late night pizza delivery & this was the first option. The only downside is that we had to bust a mission for pickup bc we were too far for delivery (3 mile radius I think?). We arrived for pickup & it was immediately ready. We ordered TRex, Ono & Cheese slice (yes, we're Samoan) finally bit into each pizza and I could tell the fresh ingredients in every bite!! They're a little pricey but SO WORTH IT! I will be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this place since moving back into the area. I live about a mile away and love pizza, especially if I can just order by the slice.  My boyfriend and I stopped in last Wednesday or Thursday night and shared a salad & each got a slice.  We tried the special (it had angel hair pasta and herbs on top) and pepperoni.  The salad was big enough to split, but could've used a little more dressing. I'm sure we could have gotten more if we had asked. No biggie. The pasta pizza was more flavorful than the pepperoni and the salad was very good.

I really like the vibe when you walk up, with plants right near the entrance, murals inside with a big window and high top seating facing out so you could people watch.  Since it's an old building it has character and I like that.  It doesn't feel brand new, but doesn't feel run down or forgotten about either.  Parking could definitely be more well lit at night, but that's my only real complaint.  I also prefer more doughy/fluffy and flavorful pizza crust than what we had, but I know that's just my preference.  We decided to eat outside on the patio and it was nice. 

That's all I can think of to say about this place.  I'm looking forward to trying it again soon and hoping to see it get better and busier every time."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix! Open late night for those serious pizza lovers. Their weekly specialty pizza's sound daring to try but when you pick up a slice it will never disappoint your taste buds!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this late night pizza place in my neighborhood for years. The last time I went, a person in an orange adidas jacket walking through the kitchen and talking to the staff in the kitchen was later on the patio objectifying women and trash talking Phoenix to patrons. When I expressed my dismay he essentially laughed it off as boys will be boys and joked if he will see me at the strip club later as I was leaving. I will not be spending money at this place any longer."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, pizza is ok but just ok. It is definitely not worth the price. Over rated place in a bad area of town where hipsters like to go."}
{"text":"If there is a pizza restaurant I must try it just to know whether or not if I'm missing out on something.  Tonight, a first Friday Art Walk, we decided to explore Grand Avenue which is gathering momentum as an interesting place to be with an interesting mix of small shops and artist.  The area has an decidedly urban neighborhood feel which is perfect for this storefront pizzaria for the locals.   

Prior to trying the pizza joint, we were at Third Space where we happened to engage in conversations of where to go and how was the pizza across the street.  The patrons had mixed reviews.   After a few beers and a stop at Braggs, I had to try a slice or two on my walk home.   The front counter was very friendly when taking my order and neatly folding foil around my to go slices of cheese and pepperoni.  

For $3 and $3.50 a slice, I hoped for a New York style sized slice.  Rather, the slices came from something from a 14\"  inch pie -- neither here nor there.   From the first bite of the cheese to the end, the pizza taste was neither great nor bad -- it was just there.  I may have hinted a bit of milk flavor in the unremarkable crust. (Did they forget to add the yeast or let it rise?)  The sauce was neither sweet or spicy.  The mozzarella neither added nor detracted from the pizza.  It was an impression-less pizza slice.

In respect to the pepperoni slice, the pepperoni covered the entire slice which made it very greasy, However, the pepperoni didn't have a distinctive flavor.  If I would hazard a guess, the pepperoni came from Hormel.   Overall, I would call the pizza a good homemade attempt but not something I would seek-out, travel for or call for delivery.  
However, if I were leaving Third Space at 2 a.m., it would be a good slice."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place zero stars. My wife and I decided to give this place a try because of the good reviews on Google. We ordered a large pizza that came to $25! They skimped on the toppings but not on the grease! Highly overrated! Either the reviews I read were fake or the people were drunk and high when they ate there."}
{"text":"My first experience was a few days ago. Honestly the pizza is pretty good. This was one of those times where I can say I am glad I had the opportunity."}
{"text":"Fantastic Calzones!  Tucked in at Grand and 11th Ave in the Oakland Historic District,  Carson (the owner) took great care of me and my lady. Fast and friendly service. More than worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Was excited for this since right it's down the street from my house and open late but I was disappointed. Super pricey $18.00 for a cheese pizza that's 18 in. Each topping is $3 extra. So if you want a pepperoni and mushroom pie, you are looking at 24 smackers before tax...we opted for slices. I had veggie which was $4. It was good but small, especially for that price. This is not an affluent area so not sure how this will go when you can drive just down the road to Cibo and it's cheaper. Drink selection very limited. I also don't like how their Ipad cash register guilts you to tip on an already overpriced pie that was taken to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place Downtown --- especially because it's open so late. I'm a server myself and sometimes don't get out of my restaurant until 2 AM, and Grand Avenue is open until 4 which makes it a great spot to go afterwards. The staff is always prompt and friendly, and the pizza shop is so cute and very artsy Phoenix-esque. It's tiny inside so I recommend taking a seat in the back outside, where string lights light up the space and a fire is burning during the winter. Love this place! Such good pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing.  All around amazing. Seriously yelpers, what is your problem with this place? The pizza is top notch and you can taste the amount of pride they have in each slice. The service was awesome. Not only are they great people, they can have a great conversation. Easily one of the best places in Phoenix, bar none. Always try the special!!"}
{"text":"We've been lucky to see quality pizza joints opening in and around downtown Phoenix. All of them, however, seem to be the thin crust wood or brick oven fired variety. I have nothing against that style of pie and enjoy the pizza joints that have been opening but if I'm going out for pizza, what I really want is a floppy NYC style slice. Enter Grand Avenue Pizza Company.

Dropped in around 1 AM on a Saturday. I was just sitting around on my duff and watching Japanese wrestling videos on YouTube when the desire for a slice hit. I had recently discovered that Grand Ave. Pizza was open until 4 am so I walked over and order some slices.

It's everything I expected it to be. A quality slice. Slices of pepperoni go for $3.50 each. Not too bad when I've paid the same for larger, but inferior, slices in NYC. My only regret is not visiting sooner. Grand Avenue Pizza Company was left on my \"to do\" list for far too long.

Prices for an entire pie are a bit high. An 18\" pepperoni will set you back $21. I'm willing to pay more for local, though, and quality to boot.

The joint itself is small but has pizzeria charm and I think there's a dining area in back or along the side of the building but it was dark and I didn't explore so don't hold me to it.

Good pizza. I will return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They use really delicious, fresh ingredients and make a very tasty pizza! Love how their crust is nice and thin, and their flavor combinations or great! Not to mention they're open really late and deliver! Also would like to give a shout out to the staff because they deliver quickly, food always come hot and they are very polite. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Pizza with vegan options that delivers passed midnight?!?!? Who...what...yes this place does it. You can go and eat there as well or pick it up, but seriously genius idea. The crust, the sauce, the veggies...was all perfectly put together and delicious."}
{"text":"If you like stale reheated pizza that is served burnt, then this is the place for you.  If you ask, what about the fresh speech I got when ordering, then expect to experience a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Horrible service and disgusting pizzza! Do not recommend , I never do these things but the manager of this place deserves to be apprehended  for his actions and the things he said to his customers. In any business they deserve to keep customers happy . --- after talking with the manager I will never give my money to this place again! Hello papa johns! ;)"}
{"text":"So glad this place finally opened!  I had been wanting pizza for a good month, and I remembered they were open late night.  

It's a cute little space with a rad mural inside.  They offer cheese or pepperoni by the slice $3 and $3.50, and they have whole pies as well (12'' for $12 and 18'' for $18 plus more if you want to add toppings) and they always have some kind of delicious special going (which is only available by the pie, just an fyi).

I don't think this place is pricey, especially considering all of the fancy pizza places that popped up.  This place is a no bull pizza joint, and the fact that they are open from 8pm-4am Tuesday-Saturday is an added bonus!  I think this place is PERFECT for a late night snack after an evening of barhopping with friends or for restaurant workers (who usually get out too late to enjoy anything other than something berto's or Denny's). They don't deliver just yet, but are fully planning on doing so:) 

When I stopped in, I ordered two slices of cheese.  The crust is thinner, but not super crunchy like thin crust.  It has a nice little crunch with a pillowy texture inside.  Good sauce, good cheese made by good peeps.  My friends decided to join me, so I ordered a slice of pepperoni and they ordered pepperoni with mushrooms and jalapenos.  No one was disappointed and we all have been talking about it since we dined there last week!

Lastly, the crew is great! Nice and friendly, playing great tunes and having a good time making pizza and chatting with customers.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Called in for delivery and the guy taking the order was so obnoxious. He couldn't write down a simple phone number. Yea and 27 dollars for a large pizza with garlic?? No. Just so much no. This isn't Los Angeles, it's downtown phoenix so don't kid yourself. Way too expensive for a pizza. It's good but not that good. Also, $3 per topping?! Tessio's charges 50 cents per topping. Are these limited edition or endangered toppings? The audacity."}
{"text":"what a great slice place I would say one of the best places in the valley the sauce is not too sweet very balanced the cheese tasted great because it was just hot out of the oven the dough is what makes a pizza fluffy not too crunchy quite delicious enjoyed there pumpkin snickerdoodle cookie as well they're little on the pricey side but you give you get what you pay for got the counter was great too"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Arizona! I love a good crispy crust and they have that down to a science. Their special pizza was amazing too. They go the extra mile without being a fancy pizza joint. They are open late too which is great for my work schedule!"}
{"text":"What a great place to have a slice or whole pie. The pizza is NY style & delish. I love that it's locally owned, operated & supports local artists. Just a great place to chill & eat. If you need beer with your pizza just get it to go & cross the street to Third Space & voila Pizza & beer. They always have a special pizza & it's usually super creative & delish. The patio is great place to chill with the fam & friends. If that's not enough they also deliver. Try this place & you'll be a return customer for sure."}
{"text":"We tried ordering a menu item, was told they dont make the Tacos they had listed on the menu. Got a chicken sandwich that was inedible. The check in or whatever you do was awkward and the people taking our orders were not knowledgeable about their own menu. Nice roomy space, but for the money - gots to go somewhere else. Good Luck !"}
{"text":"Was in town for Spring Training and we were starving at 10pm on Friday night. We were able to order a a pepperoni pizza and cheese bread and they delivered to our hotel room. Both were really good. Pizza was a but greasy for my liking but the cheese bread was really good."}
{"text":"Pizza here is awesome! I ordered a white pizza to go and when I got there I realized I got a free slice of cheese pizza for checking in. Tried the cheese on my way home and it was AWESOME! The crust had just the perfect crunch to it and tastes delicious. My white sauce with roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes was great also. i look forward to coming here again and trying some of their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"The crust is bomb 
The flavor is full 
And the drinks are great 
What else do you need?"}
{"text":"Visited the Grand Avenue Pizza Company for the first time last night. The food was delicious but SUPER expensive! Turns out, you pay high premiums for any kind of toppings. To put that into perspective for you. my calzone with two drinks (non-alcoholic) came to well over $30. I was seriously taken aback by that.

Probably if the food was just a *little* more affordable, I'd make this place a regular stop. It may also be true that my first experience was an unfair one, because who judges a pizza place on their calzone?

Maybe I'll have to stop back again sometime soon and order a single slice of pizza and see how that treats me. If I can get out the door with a single slice of pizza for under $10, maybe I'll amend this review (because apart from the high cost, the entire experience was very favorable)."}
{"text":"Place is pretty awesome. They are opened late and it always a good call for post-party drunk food. Pizzas are pretty huge so keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"Three years ago, I rated this establishment with two stars (deservingly so, I might add). I promised myself I would never eat at GAPC again!

 On the night of December 23, 2017, I attended an ugly sweater party and the young man hosting the party offered me a slice of pepperoni pizza as he was walking the boxes of pizza into his living room. Two bites into my slice of the pie, it was a wrap! I had to ask where he got the pizza from and he said GAPC. I was in complete shock! The pizza was flames!!! Moral of the story: everyone deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"If I am up late and my tummy is grumbly, I am almost certain I am going to end up here to get two of the best slices of pizza I have had in Phoenix.  The ingredients are fresh, the pizza is never burnt, the staff is what you would expect from a tough-guy-hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Grand Ave, the specials are different every single day, they deliver, GAPC offers whole pies and slices.  I used to have the high score on some of the old arcade games there, so if you beat my score, you have to buy me a slice since I was the one that told you to come here in the first place."}
{"text":"Jerks ran outta pizza last night. Couldn't get my zaa fix. To Corey... Thx fatty. Hahahah."}
{"text":"I can always rely on great pizza!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Pizza at 1:30am was hot as fuck just like the guy in the back who was making the pizzaZ. So was the guy who took our order, all the staff was kind and friendly. Will be back xoxo"}
{"text":"Their salads are the absolute best. Fresh ingredients. Super friendly staff. I go about 3 times a week and each time the salad is different which is awesome!"}
{"text":"I believe that companies who refuse to pay their employees should loose their business license personally! I could not give them 2 weeks notice because of my back, so the owner decided not to pay me for the hours I had worked. Even kept my Credit Card Tips!"}
{"text":"Ive order here once, not to happy with the results. 1 hr to receive a pizza and then discovered that all the toppings landed in 1 half of the pizza. I had asked for new pie, they were generous about making a new one, so then i waited for another hour to get a new pizza which i was  cool with. A couple of weeks later i was gonna order from there, but then i was told i had  ended up on a \"list\", im on their because the order got all sloppy on the delivery boys end and some how became a conflict? I just wish i could i could spoke to someone about this \"incident\" with a manger of a sort so we can come to compromise. Overall good pizza bad customer service"}
{"text":"After going out, where else u gonna go for late night pizza downtown?! Always got slices on deck and different specials. 
Ps. Patio is super chill."}
{"text":"This place was the only place open late at night when me and my friend were hungry. The staff was pretty friendly. Pizza was decent."}
{"text":"Yum! You can totally tell this guy hails from the east coast; it's all in the crust baby! Authentic New York style pizza, cozy location away from the hustle and bustle of what Downtown Phoenix becomes during work lunch hours and the staff was super friendly! Did I mention that it is also super affordable and quick? So going back, possibly every Friday..."}
{"text":"Rip off tiny slices they don't stretch the dough enough hipster jerkoffs trying to make believe it's New York pizza  don't fall for it......maybe they will learn one day. ."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little place with a great vibe in a neighborhood that I love to see doing well... but the pizza doesn't cut it. We got an 18\" pie with sausage and pepperoni on half, basil and mushrooms on the other, and also used the Yelp check-in deal to claim a free veggie slice. Nothing was great. The crust tasted slightly sweet and didn't quite seem to jive with any of the toppings."}
{"text":"I have ordered with them countless off times and they never fail! Their staff is always super friendly and the pizza is always on point! I definitely recommend them to satisfy your pizza needs! The pricing is a bit pricey BUT worth it 100%"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, just purchased one piece, but it was so hard to not get another. $3 for pepperoni slice, nice size!"}
{"text":"I will keep this brief, the pizza is standard issue New York style pizza. They only do salads, drinks and pizza. When I ordered on the phone the person answering was a little curt when I inquired if they did wings, desserts, etc. I was thrilled that they are open late and deliver late. I ordered a large pizza (18\") with basil and mushrooms. They do two sizes, a 12\" and an 18\" I wish there was something in between, but c'est la vie. It was $32 for a large pizza with two toppings and the delivery fee. It seemed a little steep. They wouldn't allow me to pay the driver with cash, and instead asked me to use a card, which is fine, but it was inconvenient. It should be noted that the delivery driver was extremely polite, which I appreciated. I would order from them again, if another late night delivery need arises."}
{"text":"Finally, some authentic New York pizza in the desert. Unfortunately its average New York pizza at best. Ordered 2 cheese slices. Not bad. Lacked real New York zing and pep. The outdoor seating is cool. Really like the live edge tables. It gives the restaurant personality. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Price: expensive. Paid 19.75 with tax for a 10\" pizza. Very very VULGAR, abusive.  Not family friendly. 

Service: BAD, bad, bad. No sense of service, NOT family friendly. EXTREMELY VULGAR.  

We waited inside for our pizza to be finished. The staff was less than 10 feet away from us cursing like a sailor with Tourette's. 

I counted, about every 5 Th word was F this F that, t*ts and etc etc. 

I don't care how they speak when my family is not spitting distance from them but honestly I was flabbergasted and ready to punch them in the face. Yes.  It was that bad. 

I've had pizza here a couple of times. Each time I've found the pizza to be of decent and good enough taste and quality. It's not bad, it's not great, it's better than okay.

Expensive. 
Vulgar and abusive."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Open late night, perfect spot to fulfill that midnight craving. Friendly staff, great food. Yum in my tummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! From the times I've been out late drinking at Bikini Lounge and need a late night snack, or  the times I've finished work pretty late and can't even think about cooking, this place has never failed. 

Their prices are good, their hours work for later eaters, and most of all, their pizza is good! I also really enjoy their slice option. Since moving to Phoenix, from a big city where slice places are mostly the only option, it's been hard to find a good slice place. For a while, I almost never ate pizza here because there is something  weird and gluttonous about ordering an entire pizza for my lonesome. That, and I'd have to eat the pizza for an entire week. But I'll stop digging into the loser hole right now. Thank you for the slices, Grand AVenue Pizza! 

Whole pizzas are still an option for those who want it. AND they have calzones. Just to clear things up. 

Another thing I really loved about this place was their staff. Everyone is so friendly and happy to be here! I walked in once on a Saturday night and the employee up front was taking a phone order from a drunken customer. While most people would find the customers incoherence frustrating, the employee took the call with ease and happiness. 5 stars for that alone! 

Overall, cool place and great pizza!"}
{"text":"We just ordered pizza from these guys last night at 3 AM and it was exactly what we needed! My boyfriend and I get off work really late and the last thing I wanted to do last night was drive back out to get something to eat- these guys were kind enough to deliver the pizza without sweatin' it and were here faster than any typical chain pizza place. Open late, a lil' greasy and delicious- you wont be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I know I've said this before, but just to reiterate:  The Downtown Phoenix stretch of Grand Avenue really is the new Roosevelt Row.  Not so long ago, Roosevelt Row was a collective of diehards.  Entrepreneurs that were doing their best to make it despite long odds, outdated infrastructure, & often on shoestring budgets.  These business owners were daring, willing to defy conventional thinking, & make their own rules.  While Roosevelt Row still contains pockets of that diehard spirit, its safe to say Roosevelt Row can no longer be considered an underdog.  That's not necessarily a bad thing as Roosevelt Row is still awesome, just more modernized (& okay, more gentrified) & with a much larger neighborhood population.

Grand Avenue on the other hand, looks a lot like what Roosevelt Row was about 10 years ago.  Pitch black at night, a mishmash of old buildings, oddly placed businesses, & seemingly no rhyme or reason to any of it.  It's the type of neighborhood artists fawn over (which might explain why many former Roosevelt Row galleries have moved here).  That fearless (almost rebellious) spirit carries over to many of the restaurants along this stretch.  Grand Avenue Pizza certainly fits the bill.  A tiny space on Grand & Fillmore (just across the street from ThirdSpace) that at first glance from the exterior might seem like just another pizza joint.  But Grand stands out from its competition in ways both good & not so good.

I arrived here on a Saturday evening around 6.  I had expected a little bit of a crowd, but nope just two others inside and none on the patio.  Okay then.  The interior is as I mentioned, tiny.  Bar style seating for 12 & thats it.  Around back there's a patio with a lot more room (probably 20-25 more).  What interior space there is, its nicely decked out with lots of unique art on the wall and theres numerous stickers proudly proclaiming that Yelpers hate them (a good chuckle for me as you can imagine).  The menu here has a surprising amount of variety for such a small kitchen setup.  They have four pizzas available by the slice up front, a menu of assorted traditional pies, an assortment of their own pie recipes, & a chalkboard with the current special of the day (today it was a sausage pizza with a basil-ricotta & panko parmesan breadcrumbs).  They also have a vegan pie & (as any good pizza joint would) the ability to create a pie of your own however you want.  For my first visit, I decided I'd give one of Grand's own house recipes a try.  I went with a 12\" Jimmy Legs.  The specs:  Grilled chicken, basil pesto, smoked bacon, red onion, broccoli, tomato, cheddar & mozzarella.  Total cost for the pizza, a bottled water & tax: a steep $20.  More expensive than the most expensive 12\" options at Pomo, Cibo or Bianco?

The pizza took about 10 minutes to come out.  When it did, I noticed there was no plates, no knives, no forks.  They just gave me a sheet of wax paper for the pizza slices.  There was a roll of paper towels at the table to wipe my hands, but no utensils.  Huh?  I will say the combo of flavors from the ingredients on this pie were pretty tasty.  The bacon & pesto especially were excellent accompaniments.  And I was impressed how high they piled the toppings.  The thick layer of toppings also meant I was making a complete mess on my hands & wax paper, but I digress.  Unfortunately, I have to dock a point for the crust.  I'm someone who likes a nice crispy crust on the outside.  Chewy inside is fine, but I like a little crunch on the exterior.  Unfortunately the crust on this pie was chewy all around, a texture more akin to a warm bagel than a cooked pizza crust.  It was an okay pizza all things considered, but I'd be hard pressed to make a case for dropping such a large sum for this house creation.  Full disclosure they did give me a coupon for 10% off for next time, so at least it'll be cheaper then.

Two aspects of this pizza place that truly stand out from others in the Downtown area are (1) they deliver within 3 miles of their restaurant and (2) they are open till 4am most days and even deliver at this ungodly hour.  This might well be where Grand gets its niche audience, as I can easily picture late night revelers, Downtown college kids, warehouse workers, and others visiting or getting a pie delivered at these late hours.  There's an extra $3 fee if you get it delivered so just bear that in mind.  I'll give Grand props for being bold enough to take a chance on what most would undoubtedly consider an insane business model.  For me though, its mostly about the pizza.  Their menu is creative and even innovative in spots, but from my experience the final product doesn't quite justify the price.  I wish Grand luck and if I'm ever pulling an all nighter and need a fix I just might look them up.  But with so many outstanding pizzerias Downtown, Grand will need to up its game.  Both before and after most of Phoenix has gone to sleep."}
{"text":"Burnt, stale pizza and rude service is the hallmark of this rathole!  Be prepared for bait & switch as they will lie to you about fresh, and then try to serve you reheated leftovers."}
{"text":"absolutely great the best pizza and they delivered to my truck this place has really great prices right atmosphere fun and friendly people prices are very reasonable actually cheaper than most and the cook is outstanding the pizzas Great can'twait to come back"}
{"text":"Grand Ave Pizza just opened. We are very excited about this. You can get a great pizza until 4am. This is good thin crust pizza. The place has inside dining and a patio but it is small (cozy?). No beer/wine yet but maybe in the future. I am going to recommend this place and I give the pizza 4-4 1/2 stars. However- 2 things: hours; they don't open til 8pm. Earlier opening time time- say- 5pm(?) Price; $12/12\" and $18/18\" pizza. A bit pricey. A single slice is $3-$4. It's good pizza but it should be 2-slices/$5 for cheese and 2-slices/$6 for single topping! I will mention this to the owner. If they knocked a couple bucks off the price I'd give them 4 1/2 stars easy peasy!"}
{"text":"Blown away, completely blown away.  The hours are perfect if you're a night owl, the pizza is, as I'm told from a New Yorker, New York style pizza.  We had tried a lot of other pizza joints together and while they were all great this one took us completely by surprise on how good it is.  

It's ready very fast even if you order something special.  The staff was very friendly and engaging.  If you're in the area late at night and need a bite you would be doing yourself a disservice to not give this place a chance."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of delicious pizza from the East to the West and this pizza  is now on my Top 5 best pizza places . If you like mixing things up then I highly recommend the ANIMAL pizza ... I did get it modified.  Thanks for having pizza with integrity!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza joint in phoenix since it opened ! But they recently they changed the recipe of the pie and its really disappointing, especially since i live a few blocks away.."}
{"text":"It's pretty cheesy. But it's the bee's knees if you're trying to order something past your bed time. Everything else open super late that delivers (Domihoes) tastes like the box it came in on and will give you diabetes three slices in.

And don't forget to live a little and try the white sauce pizza there. It's actually pretty dope."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years and finally made an effort to stop in and check it out...so glad we did!  The pizza was sinfully delicious...the type of pizza you will crave over and over.  We each had a slice of cheese and pepperoni pizza and were checking out the full size pizza our neighbor ordered with envy.  We will definitely come back and order a whole pie next time.  Love that the patio is pet friendly too - bonus!"}
{"text":"Small place, but a great slice! They have daily special pizzas after 8pm, and they aren't just pep & pineapple.. Had a great Poutine pizza tonight, and they're open when the clubs get out.."}
{"text":"First time and the service is top notch the location reminds me of an old school east coast pizza shop with a westcoast artsy edge! The pizza is amazing and the lunch special of 2 slices and a drink for 6 bucks you really cant beat it"}
{"text":"Meh. I ate this pizza sober and it was just bland. Give me about 5 delicious IPAs and I'm sure it'd be fantastic! But so is Filiberto's when you're three sheets to the wind. I'll deal with the horrendous parking situation at Cibo next time."}
{"text":"Seriously, though.  It's $20 for a basic-ass 12-inch cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Its 0230 AM, you have been drinking more than you should and whatever else, and now you wanna eat. You dont feel like mad abdomen churning from bean/whatever burritos at one of em 'bertos. What are you gonna do ? Heck , head on down to the GAPC and eat some genuinely nice pizza. 

5 stars for service, no doubt about it. Excellent turn around times, about 10 ish minutes... I mean lets be real, they have to bake the darn thing and its not some frozen junk being passed off as fresh ! Super friendly staff by super friendly staff - Super ! 

No plates just wax paper, but thats ok. That stuff just adds to the enormous waste pile we all create. No utensils were there either but if you are eating pizza with a fork and knife (esp at 2 in the morning ) you have other problems  that we are not going to get into . A tad bit over priced, maybe .. but seriously you dropped more on booze and all things considered it isnt pricey by much. 

Location - Grand Ave, heck yea, the less gentrified, still real part of town where the spirit of Roosevelt Row lives on ! And they deliver if you live within 3 miles, so theres that too. 

Oh they sell em by the slice too iirc, so you know you dont have to do all that cardio in the morning. I mean you did drink all your calories like you should right ? 

So where did the missing star go - that my friends is because all things said and done, its still a pizza joint and it isnt the best pizza I have had or in that league. its pretty darn good but it just isnt 5 star good."}
{"text":"Oh, Grand Avenue Pizza Company, I drove across town to try your Large Marge and I had high expectations.  Your margherita pie was indeed large but so, so average.  There was nothing about the dough, cheese, or sauce that lifted this pizza out of the ordinary.

I feel bad writing this review but I do it with the hope that your pizza improves because you're in a great neighborhood and I would love to visit again.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Really great pizza and homemade cookies.  Recommended from Hyatt front desk.  Would absolutely order again.  Quality pizza downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pizza is serious business to me, having grown up in New York. In my younger days, Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and others were not readily available to send me semi edible food at 11 pm. We had to rely on smaller mom and pop pizzerias to scratch that itch (shout out to Jason's New York Pizzeria.) Grand Ave Pizza Company successfully captures the spirit of that experience, and it also offers some more contemporary takes on a classic food.

The store itself is tucked into a small store front in the Grand Ave District of Central Phoenix, which is probably going to be gentrified within the next decade. It's across from Third Space and a short walk from Bikini Lounge, and it's open until 4 am most days. So the ideal scenario in which you are enjoying a few slices is about 1:30 am after leaving a bar. The lobby itself is rather small, and they display their drink selection and various pastries, and have a board that announces their weekly special pie. The drink selection includes cans of soda, La Croix, Mexican Coca-Cola, and if you want to get weird with it things like sarsaparilla. I've honestly never tried their desserts, so this score does not reflect their selection. If you want a cannoli with your pizza, go nuts.

What gets this place a five star score is their pizza. It's a marked improvement over large chains, and you can taste the quality of their ingredients. It's a New York style crust, that's usually cooked to crispness with this buttery taste. Their sauce and cheese are also excellent. What one may find interesting is their rotating weekly special. It's usually not something that aligns with my tastes, although the few times it's been something I'm down for have been great. Beef Stroganoff pizza stands out for me specifically. My usual dining companion gets the special almost every week, and I can't recall a time he didn't enjoy their special.

If you want a quick late night meal, Grand Ave is one of the few places I would recommend without reservation. It combines the quality, unpretentious options of a small pizzeria with the more adventurous options you would expect to encounter at a more upscale place."}
{"text":"Great pizza, cool people.   Best place to get food late at night in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pizza took 40 min wasn't even busy..pizza was over cooked cardboard consistancy. Super overpriced for what I wished was as good as frozen pizza...maybe next time I wind up here they will redeem themselves but I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great slices, fresh specials, understated coolness.  This late night pizza joint caters to downtown locals, bar hoppers, and pizza lovers alike.  Grand Ave Pizza keeps Phoenix real."}
{"text":"Awesome location,  space and decor.   Also,  awesome pizza!  By the slice or the whole wheel.   Local and fresh ingredients.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is..average. They deliver until 4, great. Not so great when they send a woman to your door at 2am. Then she brings the wrong order. I called in, and got no refund, no correction. Nothing, not even a sincere apology. That shows greed. And a \"we don't really care\" attitude. 
Get it together.
I will say, the wrong order delivered, was good. And they also brought me food at 2am..."}
{"text":"This place is def has the best delivery pizza in dtphx!! The staff is a bunch of badasses never have I ever had a problem with the food nor the service at grand! Also Noel is the best she always is so friendly and makes sure my food is aways on point!"}
{"text":"We got here at a 3:30 in the morning on Sunday and I wasn't expecting much. But the pizza was Amazing, the crust was the perfect texture and the T-Rex pizza had the perfect amount of toppings! The service was mediocre but the food is what really matters!"}
{"text":"My babe got the \"cuban b\". I would never taste a pizza with pickles UNTIL NOW! Wow. what an experience.  I love this friendly fast paste experience.  Dudes are totally cool and home wecoleming. Will most def come back for more!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good! I feel like a buck-fifty is a bit much to ask for a can of soda, but that really is my singular and most legitimate gripe with an otherwise wonderful pizza place on Grand Ave.

COME GET NOMS!"}
{"text":"Wish I could provide a more positive review...I live super close to this pizza joint and happy to see more businesses along Grand Ave. 

Pizza is sure a very personal thing so some may love GAPC and some may not. I'm in the latter category.

For this pizza lover, the crust is everything and creates a foundation for any good (or bad) product.
Well, their crust is simply bland. Cardboard-like and usually undercooked. (I learned to ask for \"well done\"). But even then, there is simply no flavor to the crust.

As far as the sauce and other additions, it's basic. Nothing to write home about.

Expensive!!! Holy cow!!! Way to spendy for what it is."}
{"text":"Customer service was very good but the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza I actually think frozen pizza would have been better."}
{"text":"I stopped by here late night to get something to absorb all the alcohol I consumed, got there just at the right time! There was no line, inside there is minimal seating but since we got there at a good time We had a place to sit! We ordered two slices of cheese pizza and water, the pizza was delicious, but I am not a fan of arrowhead bottled water, but to each it's own! Service was good everyone was friendly and pizZa was ready fast, thin crust and sssoooo yummy!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the pizza was actually cheap but it wasn't that great in taste. 5.99 for 2 slices & a can of soda. My boyfriend & I stumbled across this place driving through Phoenix on our way back to LA. We walked in & there was really awkward seating inside. It's super small in there but too hot to sit outside in 118 degree weather.  To start we were the only people there & the girl who took our order was rude. It seemed like we were bothering her because we were ordering something. To make matters worse it was really hot in there, had a ton of flies, & they were blasting some terrible drum & bass/ dubstep music. No thanks."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The sauce they use is especially delectable, and I thoroughly enjoyed the crust.  I would have to say this is the best slice of pizza I've had in phx. $6.49 for 2 slices of pizza & a can of soda.  On the pricier end of pizza joints, but the taste is worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this they're open late night which makes it that much better . Made our own pie  and had the cheesy bread. Nice fresh ingredients ,It was awesome . The Arizona's lemon lime is a must. Also this was the only place that would deliver after 10 pm . We were downtown do it worked out great ."}
{"text":"Nope.  Salty.  Sauce tastes like it's bought in bulk.  Dough isn't anything special, consistent with pre made stuff.  Only good reviews are cause it's open late."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place! Ever since it opened, I have occasionally tried the pizza. I've always stopped in for slices and was a little surprised at the cost, but I do like supporting local businesses, especially a late nite pizza place on Grand! Never been terribly impressed, but I've only ever had the cheese pizza.

This past Saturday (8/8), I finally decided to order a whole pie. I called in my order for an 18\" with pineapples and jalapenos and headed down to the shop to pick it up. It wasn't quite ready when I got there, so I paid ($24+) and we waited a bit. They gave us an ample amount of cheese and peppers, which was nice. When I got home, I was soooo disappointed! (I don't know why since it was just the same as all the slices I've ever ordered.)

- Same old flavorless crust, poor spongy texture.
- Blah sauce as always, tastes like just plain tomato with no spices.
- Barely enough cheese to cover the pizza
- about 12 pineapple pieces and maybe 14 jalapeno slices - for $3 each, I would expect to get more than 2-3 of each topping per slice!!

I don't like writing negative reviews of local businesses, but seriously, this place needs to listen to some feedback and pump up the FLAVOR and the VALUE of the pies!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a late night snack or anytime of day really. Gotta love that they are open until 4:00AM daily though. Last delivery is at 3:30AM. 

I had two slices of the daily pizza special. Fantastic combination of salami, cauliflower, cheeses and who knows what else. It was great. 

They have a nice pizza menu and a couple of salads. They also have bottled or canned sodas. No booze here! 

Very clean, limited seating inside but there is a nice patio to hang out at. 

Check this place out. It's pretty cool!


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great for walking in after a night out, but terrible for delivery service. After waiting for over an 1 1/2, we called and were told they didn't know where the driver was but our pizza was sitting there. We were not even 1 mile away... We cancelled our order. Pizza is good if you walk in, but don't waste your time with delivery."}
{"text":"Great pizza till 4am + great friendly service = don't hesitate! Go grab a slice! Very cool little spot...the sauce and cheese are really good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! The pizza is the best but the desserts are ridiculously amazing! The guys running the place are so nice and courteous, you will get great customer service here! My best friend and I came here late at around 1am and it was packed. The line moved quick cuz the guys running it are awesome! Although it's very small inside where you order, there's a comfortable patio outside where you can eat. They are open late too, wish they had another location in Scottsdale, but it's worth the distance to drive so we will be back!"}
{"text":"Late (really late) night delivery was a blessing.  Staff was very friendly taking our order and delivery time was right on target.  Pizza was good although it was just a bit too greasy--ingredients (veggies) were fresh and I really liked the red sauce. Overall, pretty solid and would recommend."}
{"text":"Pizza downtown open until 4am? I'm sold. 

The ingredients are fresh and bought locally at this late night pizza spot. Come around 2am after the bars close and continue the party with BYOB or come for the people watching late on a First Friday. The patio has plenty of seating and its always a fun time. 

The daily pizza specials definitely wont disappoint, go for a slice or a whole pizza, either way you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"As I work night shift, it's always hard to find fresh food anywhere. I Walked in about 3:30am. Staff was super friendly and talked to me while my pizza was being prepped. Pizza was HUGE! it was delicious and worth the price! I definitely will be back. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I honestly feel like this might be the best pizza in phoenix! we came here tonight and ordered an 18\" pizza with garlic, mushrooms, onions, and olives- there were three of us, all major pizza eaters, and we still had 2 slices left. I felt the price was totally comparable to other places in phoenix- if I want a $5 cheese pizza as another reviewer mentioned, then i'll go to little caesar's. the fact that they used kalamata olives was particularly awesome. the pizza was amazing, the outdoor seating area is nice and has misters, and the service was great. the fact that they are open until 4am is also a plus!"}
{"text":"I've looked all over Phoenix for something resembling NYC pizza.... This is the place for it! So delicious and fresh! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"First I have to say this place is ultra casual! small lobby with room for about 6 people, and a large patio out back. tables are all set with a roll of paper towels.

Service across the counter and again when pizza was brought out to us was friendly and efficient. a little later the delivery guy gladly retrieved us a box for leftovers.

If you follow my reviews you may remember my pizza roots are deep, I have been making quality pies since I was 15 years old. I feel solidly qualified to judge any pizza.

I often tell the silly joke, \"pizza is like sex, even when it sucks, it's still pizza\" 

Well Let me tell you Grand avenue Pizza doesn't suck!!!! It is in fact professionally made with high quality ingredients. It's that New York style pie that none of the chains can replicate. The cheese was amazing and the sauce was perfect. The dough was expertly tossed and baked to absolute perfection.

No beer, coke in cans, napkins on a roll, and crushed peppers and parmesan cheese in little packs cost 1 star but I'm nit-picking now aren't I?

I really did like this place and I would surely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Open till 4am!! Great pizza. This place is pretty cool. Def great for late night eats and they deliver till 3:30 am. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Alright. I've been here twice and had 2 slices each time. I think 4 slices of pizza merits a review now.

I really don't eat pizza all that often, it's way too glorious and I can't control myself. I end up eating an absurd amount for a 5'2\" girl, and I do it in record time. BUT, I make an exception for Grand Ave Pizza. This place is just...delightfully delightful. It is full of delightfulness. They keep things quite simple - it's small, cozy, and the menu is easy. You either order cheese, pepperoni, or the special (which changes often). On both my visits I had a slice of pepperoni and the special that day. That pepperoni pizza is no regular pizza. It's a perfect tender mix of crunchy softness. The crust isn't hard and overcooked, but it's not overly-doughy either. I noticed some people soaking up the grease with their napkins...haha! You sissies. I'll take ALL OF IT. The first special I had was the pork verde salsa - I found this slightly awkward to eat because of the large chunks of pork, but it was still very delicious. I have to say, it didn't top the pepperoni though. HOWEVER, on my second visit, the special that day DID blow my God damn mind. It was like...feta cheese (I think?), mozzarella, pineapples, balsamic vinegar, and fairy dust. I don't ever want fruit on my pizza, but holy Hell. What a great combo. Had my belly not been so full like a small Buddha, I would've gladly had another slice.

Their prices per slice average right around $3-$4 and they're pretty big. They're open super late AND deliver! I am sadly not within their delivery radius, but I would gladly go out of my way to pick up a pie. According to my east coast friends, pizza by the slice is not too common in Arizona. I'm glad that Grand Ave Pizza is filing that void. Dig the artwork too. Great spot, I think it'll be around for a long time."}

{"text":"Staying at a hotel for 5 nights. First night called and ordered a personal deep dish pizza . When I got my order delivered to my room, my pizza was a normal flat pizza. When calling to complain, I was told that the order taker told me that they didn't have deep dish pizza. Not true. Had they told me, I would not have ordered. They chose to believe their employee and not the customer. Trust me, when I want something and can't get it, I would cancel the order/or not order. It is not about the money, it is about the customer service. I am in the hospitality/food & beverage industry industry. I would never try to screw a business. I will call my credit card company about this issue. Their customer service regarding this was not right. They also lost out on another 4 days of business. And, not to mention my thinking on their way of doing business. I believe they handled everything wrong. They have to take issues on a case by case business, and I don't think they did this on this issue. Will not order from them again while I am I'm Phoenix.  Might not ever hurt their business, but I feel better about venting."}
{"text":"Pizza rocks and they stay open way late. The service is epic and they have vegan options. Keep up the good work. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pizza is \"pretty good\". 
But what really makes this place: 
1) the people (workers and patrons)
2) the atmosphere (they're usually playing some kickin' tunes over the REALLY poor sound-system). 
3) owned by a local/downtowner
and most of all ... 
4) THE HOURS! It's the only after-hours pizza by-the-slice place in town (to my knowledge).

Next time you're \"over-served\" try to remember this place, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of eating at local restaurants so I was really excited to try this place! 
My plan was to pick up a pizza for dinner on my way home from work. I then googled the address and realized it's closed from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. every weekday. Since they're open until 4 a.m., I thought to myself, well, I guess that's just the trade-off and I'll make this my post-bar munchie spot on the weekends (it's nice to have options besides Charlie's tacos!). I got home and excitedly told my husband we'd be having pizza for dinner from this place. I called about 8:05 to order a large pepperoni pizza, asked for my total and was told it would be $23. WHAT?!? $23!!! For a large pepperoni pizza? Well, I thought, if it's really good it'll be worth the price. When my husband finally came home with the pizza I was just so incredibly disappointed. First of all, the pizza didn't look at all appetizing. There were puddles of grease on top of the pepperonis. Grease is definitely an essential part of yummy pizza, but this just looked like it had grease poured over the top. The sauce was extremely oniony to the point where I just took one bite and couldn't eat any more (I don't even hate onions!) The rest of the family, unfortunately, felt the same and we were stuck with $23 in the trash and empty bellies. I then had to scramble to feed my extremely picky little children, which is never a fun mama task. Even they, who usually run around the house like maniacs when I tell them we're having pizza, set their slices down and pretended they were cars and played with them instead. 

Like I said before, I am all for eating local, but when it makes sense. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, the simplest pizza that you would just expect to taste good and not only was it bad, but extremely overpriced in my opinion. Sad Phoenician here."}
{"text":"Screw this place and the douche dude working there today (blondish green/blue eyes)!
Ordered a takeout pizza and wanted to have it on the patio but couldnt because someone wanted to be a total dick and not allow me to have my iced-tea on the premises.  I get no outside food & bev in restaurants but OUTSIDE on the BACK patio frequented by mostly homeless people and strays?! is the patio even up to code?  I brought my own TEA because I cant digest the crappy canned sodas they sell inside. Im a state professional who doesnt go around swiggin booze at lunchtime, if that was the concern.  Im old fashioned and do that at bars & in the evening like most decent human beings! lol This place is not a bar either which I would understand. This was just shitty service and a total dick thing to do to a regular. This was not about the law, it was about someone wanting to be an asshole today."}
{"text":"Hands down...best slice in town. Killer creative specials.  Hot, fresh, delicious.  Get your late night eats here!"}

{"text":"Been here 3 times now, and I have no idea how people end up giving bad reviews.  The best pizza in phoenix. Dope space and location.  Not family friendly, but let me just say, thank god for that.  They obviously pay special attention to every ingredient. Even the sides are mind blowing. Just eat here and stop getting all your opinions from the internet."}

{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place and it shouldn't be. Amazing pies! Calzone is delicious too. The best part about this place is the special which changes weekly. So many freaky toppings that shouldn't work on pizza or in combination but OMG, they make it work. My favorite so far in the last 3 months has been the roasted corn in a cup style pizza. Delicious AF!"}

{"text":"I love you Grandma Avenue Pizza... Marry Me!  Haha just kidding I just absolutely love this delicious late night spot....  The staff is cool,  you know it's a good spot when its packed and you got guys looking like Tony Montana working in the back ... The calzone is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"If your craving a mad flavorful slice of pie this is the place to handle your needs. Every slice of pizza I've had here has been delicious. The staff is insanely friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place.

1. The crust is amazing

2. They deliver to the Garfield 

3. They're open late

The slices are huge! The kind of slice you have to fold in half to eat without looking like a savage.

And seriously - the crust - it's amazing! So crispy!

I also like that their side salads are of the baby spring mix variety, none of that iceberg bs!

This is the only good/local pizza I can get delivered to my side of the hood. They always save the day after countless hours of boozing downtown. 

Side note : I've never recieved poor customer service here like other reviews have stated. 

And I've occupied this pizza joint completely belligerent. 

So cheers to the consistently good food and service!"}

So much that I snapped a pic of his face before we dipped out. If u want to give ur money to rotten people, this is the place for you! Is that a dirty rag or dough on homeboys shoulder? Health code violation!"}

#1 finding a place open late downtown phoenix
#2 that delivers
#3 whoever I placed my order with on the phone was very upbeat and friendly
#4 we asked them to hold our delivery until 1am for when we got back from the club and they didnt forget! and delivered right on time!
#5 pizza was delish and cheesey
#6 I need one by my house!!"}
{"text":"It feels like a suburban Southern California fantasy of New York City, or possibly like a Manhattanite's fantasy of suburban Southern California. It tastes delicious.

Perch on your stool with a view of gritty hipster-industrial Grand Avenue and enjoy a slice with authentic New York-style crust and contemporary foodie flavor combinations (mine was some sort of elegant beef with mushrooms).

Compared to actual NYC corner pizza-slice joints, Grand Avenue Pizza Co. is cleaner, neater, and politer, which is all to the good, especially the \"politer\" part, though I won't complain about the \"cleaner, neater.\" It feels urban without being wildly stressful, which is pretty much perfect for the concept.

The measure of how much I enjoyed this pizza is that I'm looking for excuses to visit often, even though Grand Avenue isn't my normal beat. It's literally a reason to spend more time in this reviving neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful texture to the crust, this pizza is hand tossed and just thick enough to hold the delicious toppings. I got a slice of pepperoni and a sarsaparilla. Was the pizza dripping with grease? Yes, did I eat every last bite? You betcha! 

I sat at the limited table area inside and smiled in amusement at the shenanigans of the guys working behind the counter. I'll be back, this is my kind of joint, no frill delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a local (to downtown Phoenix) open late (they run actual vampire hours opening a 8pm until 4 am) pizza joint. So, I excitedly drug my husband in on day one (or two depending on if you count grand opening as day one).  We walked over and grabbed a couple slices of pepperoni and a sample of the daily special. 

It was ok. I've eaten far worse by way of pizza...but this was not a great-I-want-to-have-them-again pizza experience either.  I will likely give them another chance - a few months down the road- and see if the issues we experienced were just opening issues.

The slices are served piping hot from the oven and huge! This should be a good thing, yet when we picked up our slices (to fold and eat...ya know like ya do) the crust broke. It wasn't completely done.  Burning hot greasy cheese and pepperoni oozed its way through the cracks make it difficult to eat.  I love greasy pizzas, don't get me wrong, but I don't like wearing them because the crust can't stand up. 

Lest you think I'm just being a picky crust person, my husband also had issues with his slices. Similarly the owner and chef both voiced (in a conversation between them, but not to the customers but carried out in front of us) that the oven wasn't heated properly and nothing was coming out done correctly.  Did they offer to throw our slices back in? Nope. Nothing was even said to us. 

It's a new restaurant, it's possible to fix these issues. We'll see. I'll adjust my review later. 

Also...as a side note....not having anything to do with my rating but wanting people to be aware. This is a very tiny place. At most 5 people can sit. If all 5 stools are filled, I'm not sure how other guests can come in. So plan to grab your pie /slice and go."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there's so much hate for this place on Yelp. I have only been here late night,  but I've always had a great experience. 
This place is very reminiscent of a slice joint in Chicago or the East coast. The quality is awesome for a lil pizza joint such as this. The crust is nice and flaky without being too thin. We ordered the special last night and loved the beautiful flavor pairings of mushrooms,  ricotta, sausage,  and eggplant. The creativity and flavor combinations of this pizza make it one of a kind for us. Top that with their homemade ranch with fresh dill. This place is bona-fide!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to order pizza from! They are open till 4am. They always have a unique special pizza. The elote pizza when they offer it is out of this world. My only complaint is they are closed on Monday."}
{"text":"$75 for two extra large pizzas. I thought it was going to be like heaven in my mouth, but heaven is cheaper. Great late night spot if you're hanging on Grand Avenue."}
{"text":"People are up late AF downtown. Often. But what kind of food do you wanna chat over when you let the night go? Mexican? I've done that like a million times. Breakfast food? What a snooze, it can wait til Sunday morning. What we *really* want--and you will know this if you search your heart's true desires--is PIZZA. 

Big, hot, gooey, heavy, need-to-compensate-for-these-thousand-extra-calories-at-some-point PIZZA. You can't resist! Scottsdale has Joe's, Tempe has a million places, and now downtown has this. It's glorious. 

It's NY style, but the crust is *dense* toward the edges. Two slices was definitely enough for me. Between the sauce and toppings, they're not skimping on anything either. $3 for cheese and $3.50 for pepperoni won't break the bank. I am sympathetic to the argument that ordering a full pizza is pricey. $20 for a 12\" specialty forces comparisons to each of the most revered pizzerias in Phoenix, and I am too hesitant to categorize this as a premium locale that can command it. Yet. 

Another cool feature they've got is how they go nuts on their daily specials. When I arrived, it had a rather unorthodox white sauce (with sage and butter), squash, chard, pancetta, and two types of mozzarella. I'm guessing it was supposed to be sweet and spicy, but ultimately had too much going on. I still appreciate the creativity and look forward to the next one.

Overall, I can only say it's a cool place to grab a slice. And sometimes, that's all I need."}
{"text":"The simple fact is this is the best place to go at 4 a.m. great pizza, amazing people and just a fun place to go."}
{"text":"It can be hard in Phoenix to find a great gluten free pizza anywhere. Phoenix has quite a few good ones. But the gluten free crust at Grand Avenue is out of this world. My usual is pineapples, bell peppers, mushrooms, and red onions and it is on point every time. 

If you're looking for a late night pizza, and you're close to downtown, always go with Grand Avenue."}
{"text":"Perfectly delicious every time... The only reason why I rated 4 stars is based on my very first visit to this restaurant, not pleasant. I am not sure if it was because they were slammed busy phone ringing off the hook non stop and under staffed somehow became my problem ... Very rude is the treatment i received in house but now I just opt for delivery... Plus the driver is eye candy, Bonus! Yes please! I am sure and hopeful my next visit into the resturant will most certainly be a better experience, keep yall posted!"}
{"text":"I've ordered this pizza a couple times and it's always \"meh\". Not much flavor and very bland."}
{"text":"Went last night, like real quick, to pick up a couple of slices. I work all night so I needed some lunch. It was very good, even reheated. Crispy, then chewy. Nice pepperoni and great sauce. I was test driving it for future visits or call ins for delivery. Good Stuff. Hip, cool and easy peasy. Their hours work for me. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Just Da pizza.  Regular cheese New York style crust.   2nd time here and superb again.  Ate in both times.  Cool little place with a big outdoor area in the back. It took a bit for the pie to come out, but it was fresh. Homemade P and B cookie is pretty sweet too.   If you aren't familiar with the area it is across from a cool area called third space that has some cool stuff going on and  Novel Ice cream in the back ."}
{"text":"Went in for slices around 1115, and was informed that it's going to take 10min because they had to make a new pizza, therefore defeating the purpose of a slice being a quick in and out...but what eves I'll wait but it better be good.

15 minutes later my 2 roni slices arrive and meh. Everything about the za was basic. Specifically the sauce tasted like it came from a can. Reminded me of the cheap sauce from pizza lunchables."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place.  Hipsters making pizza had me intrigued. To my surprise I was disappointed. I ordered two slices and a Coke for about $8 bucks. I walked in and there was about 7 people standing in the ordering area.  It felt very enclosed and honestly a bit awkward. I ordered my pizza and waited for about 7 min to get it. I bit into the pizza and it was extremely overwhelming. The crust was harder than my liking and the taste wasn't anything to rave about.  I'll usually go back to places for a second experience but this is not a place I want to revisit.  My suggestion is try Fired Pie or Oregano's."}
{"text":"Grand just keeps getting better and better. Won't be long before it starts to get swarmed like Roosevelt, pushing all the artists and kewl shit further west. But in the meantime, places like The GAP exist (not sure it's legal to call it that?). Pizza places can be all the same, but these guys get creative. Brussel sprouts is their best, but I had some weird chicken thing (I think the chef was stoned, in a good way) and it was amazing when I had the drunchies (drunk munchies). Really looking forward to the music stuff they'll be doing in the future.

Things I would like to see:
Draft beers + growlers. Federal Pizza has a pretty damn good program going on they should implement."}
{"text":"2nd visit a year later. Thought I would try it again. Because of the other reviews. It still is TERRIBLE!!! They reheat pizza slices that has been sitting there for who knows how long. Tasted like dry sauce on cardboard. Maybe if you get a fresh just made pie it wouldn't be that bad."}
{"text":"Forget pizzeria bianco. This place is the best around. The service is perfect. Being from New York I am qualified to rate this as superb."}
{"text":"The pizza is cheap and delicious. This venue is located on the corner of a street surrounded by art galleries, and they definitely fit in. With a rad mural on the inside and beautiful lighting on the patio outside, you'll have a good seat to eat anywhere. 

Their parking is decent and all of the staff are extremely friendly and approachable. I've gone here on different times of day and received the same type of service. I always come back."}
{"text":"Heavenly, crispy perfection. Finally a joint with New York style slices! (I hate them for being so far away from home.) They are, however, close to downtown. With crazy late hours you really can't go wrong here. (8pm - 4am). Small indoor space with an outdoor back patio. 

The straight cheese version is my favorite. (And not because of the shenanigans at the Bikini Lounge up the street.) Taking only minutes to come out my palate was very, very pleased. After scarfing down a slice the nice people who work there customized a slice for us. 

Normally special requests must be made for pie orders. The awesome dude slaving away in the back heard my plea. He was already making a fresh cheese pie so it was no biggie to make two slices with Jalapeños.  (Capital \"J\" for how hot the peppers were.)

Although they laughed (and came out to watch us eat) the peppers the folks at Grand Avenue rock!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just buying 1 single slice and i know that i want to come back! The place is in a great neighbor hood with cool vibes ehich makes the experience even better! Now, the pizza. The crust wast crispy on the bottom which gave a great texture to the piece and the hot and melty cheese made my mouth water!! The knly thing that needs improvement is the sauce, its good... But not amazing. So, overall i would totally recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"How does this place not have the best rated pizza in town? I legit eat here 1-2x a week and the pizza is always BOMB. I drive all the way from Uptown to get this awesome pie. 

The pizza is NY style, greasy, fold it up and eat it. Also, they are open super late. +++"}
{"text":"Really good fresh pizza with fresh ingredients. I ordered a pepperoni jalapeño pizza and for ONCE, the jalapeños were actually spicy and fresh."}
{"text":"Ehhhh I don't know about this. I was excited to have a new pizza place very close to my house, and that serves slices no less! So after a night out with some friends, the husband and I came here to get a couple late night slices. We arrived at the (very cute) pizza place sometime around 9, so not too long after they opened and ordered 3 slices, cheese, pepperoni, and a special (which was a white pizza with asparagus, bacon, and a few other toppings). It smelled good as we took it home. Unfortunately, the slices seemed old, like they'd already been sitting out a lot longer than they possibly could have if they had been made when the store opened. The crust was dry and stiff. The special pizza was especially bad, with a very flavorless white base atop the stiff cardboard like crust... it was not awesome. The cheese was significantly better since their sauce was alright, but still nothing amazing. Maybe their full pies are better (and more fresh), but I don't know that I'd come here for slices again."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or your time. The gay black dude gave terrible customer service and looks like he hates he the world. The pizza was too greasy ... Papa Johns has better pizza ."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizza places in Phoenix! First off they are open until 4a so that's a plus, and customer service was great! I'm definitely coming back to try more things on the menu. I recommend this place to everyone! Pizza is fresh and they had it out in a jiffy"}
{"text":"This is my absolute go-to for late-night grub. The guys who answer to take your order are always so damn friendly and cool that it makes you forget that their site doesn't let you order online. (I'm sure they'll have that soon?)
The pizza is delicious and the kind that's just as tasty cold the next day; I literally took two slices to the airport in my purse last weekend... Lol... pretty sure the Southwest flight crew was jealous. Just saying. 
I get the \"Veg Out\", which is stacked with toppings and always fresh, but I assume the others are just as YUM. 
In a nutshell-- great pizza, but even if their pizza was mediocre the staff is so amazing it would make up for it, so it's just awesome that both are great."}
{"text":"Stopped here today. I'm really surprised by all the rave reviews on here; I thought it was very mediocre. It reminded me of the pizza you'd get in a school cafeteria. It's \"fine,\" but the ingredients were all very bland. The building and location are great and very cute. I'm disappointed it's not better, I really had hoped I discovered a new gem!"}
{"text":"The pizza the pizza is amazing the pizza is great people are awesome it's in a unique location but it is so awesome I love the pizza is great and it's open to 4 a.m. in Phoenix that's amazing"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza never received it :(
Called In to have it delivered but the manager or owner didn't believe me :/"}
{"text":"Carson is the best and the pizza is amazing. Open at ideal times like 4am. That is all."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza after a long night in Old Town Scottsdale and I didn't feel like standing in the long line at the spot out there. Luckily I live in central Phoenix and discovered this place.  The customer service is great, everyone has a good sense of humor and I love the fact that the Anti-Trump sign is directly in front of this place.  The pizza was really good and they give you a free water in case you're in need to sober up!  I highly recommend!!!"}
