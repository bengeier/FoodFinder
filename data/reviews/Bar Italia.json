{"text":"I've always meant to write a review about this place.....actually the most bizarre and worst restaurant experience of my life...We walked in randomly to this restaurant because it has such  a nice look to its patio...however....looks are deceiving.

We sit down and our server is pretty unfriendly even though one my friends tries to make a little small talk. She's clearly in a bad mood and does not want to be there. We order cocktails...they take wayy too long...15 min later still no drinks (the resto has like 3 other people in it).....then we hear the server arguing and telling another staff (manager?) to go F themselves...multiple times...multiple F bombs..We order food...and the fight is still continuing between the staff....we feel so uncomfortable at this point but we stay b/c we actually feel way to awkward to walk inside and cancel, it was just such a BAD atmosphere. It gets to the point she's almost YELLING and we can hear everything even though we're outside and there's music.....The food comes out and we cancel the drink order...and the server (the bartender came out this time) acts all surprised but doesn't apologize or offer to do anything. One of our food items also fails to come out even though its on the bill, but once again no apology etc etc....It was so unprofessional on so many levels. 

The food was actually pretty decent and I feel sorry for the kitchen because they do a good job and probably get horrible tip outs because of the inept waitstaff and management."}
{"text":"We recently held an event at Bar Italia - a brunch for our two year old twins. I was looking for a place that both kids and adults would enjoy, and having been to a few events upstairs at Bar Italia and eaten many good meals there (best gnocchi around) I thought I'd find out if they were able to accommodate us (with only two weeks notice). From the moment I received a reply to my email from Amanda, the event coordinator, up to the last minute of the party, everything was amazing. 

Amanda went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I was worried that a \"bar\" might not be kid friendly but found the total opposite- we had 30 kids and 30 adults in attendance and all the kids had a blast. The upstairs event space was the perfect venue, our buffet brunch was super yummy and plentiful with dishes being replenished so that everyone had more than enough, and the service was absolutely amazing. Everyone did everything they could to make sure our guests had a great time and I could not have been happier.

Amanda even came in on the Sunday morning to supervise the event, though she was not scheduled to work, to ensure the party went off without a hitch (which it did). Can't ask for more than that!

Huge thanks to Amanda, Joe (the owner) and the Bar Italia team for helping us pull off a great party on such short notice. Could not have done it w/out you!!"}
{"text":"First visit had a reservation for 7 they called and asked where we wanted to sit  and gave us a great table in the front. Everyone enjoyed their meals ,  the mushroom gnochi  and the chesse canneloni were very good  but we all left very happy  and we will be back."}
{"text":"Not great, but I'll chalk it up to summerlicious menu...I've eaten there before and it was better. Service was lousy"}
{"text":"I was taken here on a first date, which is odd because it's quite loud on a Saturday night. After spending 10mins with this guy, I realized that I was going to need wine (a lot of it) to get through the evening.  Luckily the wine list is good, good enough to distract someone from a dull and obnoxious date, and the service is great too. The food and desserts are pretty mediocre but if you need a place to drink that isn't too busy, Bar Italia is a safe bet."}
{"text":"I am very tempted to give this a 1 star!  The only thing that got me to give a 2 star is their oval shape table. I believe it's the only oval shape table, very cool looking in the restaurant, and the best part is no one would be isolated because they are sitting at one end of the table. 

Service was the worst part of the whole dinning experience. It was a Friday night, I get that, and it's busier than normal. We sat down around 7pm, and some of us were  10-15 minutes late..whatever, server came over...explained the menu, and specials of the day...took our orders around 7:30pm. We were still fine at that moment...we were all starving and got kind of impatient after 20 minutes. Our Starters finally came at 8pm! is half an hour since we ordered....what so ever...so we expect our main to come out pretty soon because it's at least half an hour since we place our orders. But no, our main did not come out until 9 o'clock. What's funnier is, one of our friends martini, that was ordered at the same time as we order our food (7:30pm) didn't come until 9pm!  

Forget about service, we tried to complaint to our server, all she said is the kitchen was very busy that night. But we just totally disagree, it's not their first friday night operation, the kitchen should know what to do in order to manage the speed. 

Anyways, more disappointing is, we all read their yelp review, everyone said the food is excellent. When we got our dishes that night.....the number one disappointing part is that 6 out of 8 plates were cold to warm. (Definitely not fresh off the stove). We complaint to our server....she did offer to bring it back to reheat it, but honestly, we were starved for 2 hours already...really? We expect her to just offer some free dessert or discount on the bill at the end as a courtesy or apology...nothing happened. Because its a birthday dinner, we opened a bottle of champagne and ordered multiples glasses of wines and martinis too. The total of our table is at least $500. Not just that she did not offer discount or free dessert, she also put in the mandatory 18% gratuity to our bill. I understand it's printed on the menu, but that's just not impressive. I will not come back ever."}
{"text":"i found the service here slow and the staff were stiff. The food was bland just like my review."}
{"text":"Last season's holiday party was held at Bar Italia. It was my first there and my first time seeing their second floor. I'm a fan of their interior style and design. Plus who doesn't love suede ceilings?! Right?! ...No? My personal fav are the blue pencil lights hanging from the ceiling in the back of the second floor. 

The holiday party deal was dinner was covered but drinks were your own bill. (I should note that I didn't organize the evening so I don't know what was agreed on) I was disappointed to find out that something as cheap as coffee wasn't included in the dinner. Slap 2 coffees onto my bill, that's right, two. Aren't refills normally free? Now I know this is would be a generous extra, but I feel it would have gone a long way to give each table a bottle of wine. Through my investigative methods I found out the price Bar Italia charged person was not cheap. It's the little extras that make the difference. I felt that Bar Italia was just interested in the suppling the most basic service they could. The food was good which helped my opinion. The food wasn't great, but it was good and I enjoyed it. I feel it should be noted that the staff was really nice. I almost didn't mind the small details Bar Italia lacked because of the awesomeness of the staff (almost). Overall I enjoyed Bar Italia and I would probably go back. If by change the manager or owner is reading this, consider going to extra mile. It would make a huge difference.

Pros:
Awesome atmosphere
Great staff
Really cool blue lights
Good food

Cons:
Coffee.. please include it
Attention to detail"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place from the get-go. As soon as we got there we asked to see a menu prior to being seated. The hostess handed us two menus to look at, and did not bother to see if we wanted to be seated until 10 minutes later. When we told her we wanted to be seated, she told us to wait for the table to be cleaned. As soon as we went to sit down, we noticed that the seats were wet from being wiped down. We then asked for water and placed our orders. We waited and waited and our food never came. One of my friend's and I noticed that other customers that had come in after us, were served their food before us. My friend then proceeded to ask our server how much longer our food would be, considering we had already waited 45 minutes and he said that he would go ask someone in the kitchen. He came back and said it would be \"a couple of more minutes\", told us that there was a backlog in the kitchen and thanked us for our patience. This was not true: there was no one sitting inside of the restaurant and it was not that crowded on the patio either. 

Another 10 minutes went by and our food still hadn't arrived. At this point I had become extremely impatient considering I did not have time to wait. My friends and I agreed that we should just leave. I went inside to tell our server. I told him that we'd been waiting long enough and that people had come in after us and had already been served their meals, and that the service was very disappointing. His response was \"I know, I'm sorry\". The lack of sincerity in his voice really made me feel unwelcomed. So I promptly told him that we could not wait any longer and that we would be leaving. His response to that was a simple \"OK\". I proceeded to go back to the patio so that my friends and I could gather our belonging s and leave. 

This has by far been the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. The server was not polite or caring. I would not recommend this place to anyone, solely because of the extremely poor service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best gnocchi in the city!!!! Love the low key atmosphere too. My aunt had the veal and it was to die for as well."}
{"text":"From the moment we checked in I knew it was going to be one of those nights. It took about 10 minutes till someone greeted us. I finally had to say we have a reservation where I was told it will be a few minutes they are setting the table. The restaurant want busy at the time so I don't know why the table wasn't even set.

Sat down we were brought menus and then for the next 20 min we waited till someone took our drink order. No water was brought to the table nothing. After ordering our drinks it took almost 15 min for our wine and beer to arrive. At that point we figured we better order or weight never see the waitress again.

We all ordered food came a significant amount of time later it was ok. The problem was the service nobody came to see how the food was if we needed anything. I definitely would never come back bc of the service you can get the food they serve at nearly any Italian restaurant nothing made them special or stand out."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Bar Italia. It's always good-quality Italian and the servers are friendly. It's a top choice if I'm looking to take someone for a nice dinner. Most of the dishes I've had there have been excellent. The gnocchi pizzaiolo I had last time was the only exception, it was decent but underwhelming. The salad with mushrooms was outstanding.

As other reviewers have noted, it can be quite loud on a weekend night when it's crowded. It might not be the best choice for say a first date. If you're going out with friends, though, it's a great option."}
{"text":"I wandered into Bar Italia last Saturday afternoon with a friend. I wanted to treat her to a nice lunch, and went for the Summerlicious Prix Fixe menu. It was definitely a disappointment. 

I ordered

First Dish - Mushroom crustini, which was regular white or brown mushrooms that tasted like they were tossed in some balsamic. They were put over a crusy piece of bread. And that was it. Nothing else going on with the flavours, or the presentation - nothing! Just blah. And only two small pieces.

Second Dish - Stuffed pepper and goat cheese salad. This was a simple mixed green/arugula salad with 4 pieces of cooked peppers around the edges of the plate.  These peppers were not \"stuffed\" at all, but rather they were small pieces of cold peppers folded over a small amount of goat cheese. Again, there was nothing going on inside the actual salad. The greens and a creamyish citrus sauce, and that was it.

Third Dish (Dessert) -  Mixed fruit with lemon ricotta curd. How can this be underwhelming? Well, it was just two pieces of under-ripe melon and about 4 grapes with only about a tablespoon of ricotta mixed with lemon rind.

- Drinks. The cocktails were actually quite delicious and we got two each. I got a grapefruit one, and my friend got a coconut one. They are why I'm giving Bar Italia one star.

For this, I paid around $100. Sadly, this was a very disappointing experience. I left feeling kind of ripped off, and like their Summerlicious menu was for suckers.

{"text":"Ye gads.  Harumph.  It pains me to write such an unfortunately negative evaluation of what seemed to be a neighbourhood standard.  I was walking along the boulevard, my cane in one hand and a work of historical academia in the other, a satirical look at the Algerian slave trade, and happened upon this 'Italian Bar', which i believe in the translation.  I've never been much for the southern languages, but I daresay my background in Latin helps me understand much of the Italian language.  I digress.  I entered in with the hopes of a breakfast and a restoring Gin and Tonic (my malaria often acts up this time of year), but was sadly disappointed.  My complaint has nothing to do with the polite service or ambiance, although the music was a bit loud and I had to turn my hearing aid down a few notches, but rather with the abysmal fare they are plopping onto the tables in this joint.  

Why would a gentleman such as myself want peameal bacon which has been pre-cooked and thrown onto a grill when ready to eat?  Or a sausage for that matter?  The real slap in the face was the toast, which cost about 90pence, thin, dry, bended pieces of rubbish.  When I pay as much for a couple of slices of the old daily bread as costs a loaf, I expect at least an inch thickness and a nice, moist centre, not the bloody bird feed I got!

I must say that the eggs were poached expertly, and the fruit salad was nice, but that is beside the point.  I beg you, have your morning nosh elsewhere.  

Good Day Sirs!"}
{"text":"I happened to be passing through Little Italy, and decided to try out this landmark. My friends and I were not disappointed. We shared the Antipasto Misto, and it was reminiscent of antipasto plates I've had in Italy. For main, I had the veal- it was perfection. The service was awesome, our server was very attentive and took care to recommend wines to pair with our meals. It was my first time at Bar Italia, and I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"the food was great, I had the swordfish special and my girl had the linguine pasta, that atmosphere could use a little work...they kept turning the lights lower and lower to the point it was getting a little hard to see, that and the floor and tables/chairs need some rework, the floors remind me of a 1995 cafeteria experience and table/chair combo's are just not very comfortable.

overall I would go back due to the good quality food, but I would like to see them bring the whole decor up to par, you can tell that they did the walls and the like semi recently but the floors and table/chair combo's just stand out like a sore thumb."}
{"text":"Food was great...when it finally game. Server kept on bumping into me when she was putting items down on the table, multiple times  knocking into me, bumping water jugs and plates past my shoulders. Automatically added gratuity to the table, without informing anyone at the beginning of the meal.  When confronted, was rude about it. Also  careless about splitting up the bill, which we asked her to do initially and was agreed upon. 

Food was very decent."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a friend for Summerlicious. We were seated immediately at the patio without utensils, menus, or water. We attempted to get the server's attention for 10 minutes as he went on to serve other tables. We finally got our orders in: crostini, risotto, and the flourless chocolate cake. 

The crostini came out fairly quickly. Artichoke and pesto spread with parma prosciutto. Tasted okay but it was over toasted, and we had a hard time chewing. 

The wait between our appetizer and entree took about 30+ minutes. We thought that if the risotto was the best thing ever, then maybe the wait would be worth it. We were disappointed. The seafood risotto was made with white rice. NOT worth the 30 minutes of waiting time. And not what we expected from an Italian restaurant in Little Italy! 

The flourless chocolate cake was the only item that I enjoyed. Unfortunately our dining and overall food experience experience was mediocre and frustrating; we don't plan to return. 

Notes: 5-6 tables occupied at the patio. Empty indoor dining room. One server. Loud atmosphere as the tables are positioned closely together in a small space."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price.
I have been here a few times and always leave very happy."}
{"text":"I'm not a particularly picky person when it comes to food but I love seafood. I was looking fo something walking distance for a Winterlicious date with my boyfriend and when I saw they had a seafood option, we decided to come here. We made 8pm reservations and were worried it would be busy but it was mostly empty when we arrived around 7:45pm. We were seated by a waiter but most of our service came from the manager. The first course arrived quickly, but I received the wrong main dish - rigatoni instead of risotto. I wasn't fussed about waiting, but we were offered complimentary glasses of prosecco for the confusion and the correct dish arrived quickly. 

Menu-wise I got the minestrone soup, seafood risotto, and chocolate cake while he got the insalata, steak, and cheesecake. My only complaints were that I found the soup a bit bland and the slices of cake were really small. The seafood risotto had lots of seafood, the steak and its sauce were very flavourful as was the salad, and honestly it was better that the slices of cake were small after the amount of food in the two previous courses.

Overall, I thought it was a very good deal and was really pleased with the service and how very sweet our server was in taking a photo of us when we asked. We didn't feel rushed to leave even as the last guests (though it wasn't yet 10pm). I'm not crazy about the regular menu so I'm not sure if I'll be back but it was definitely impeccable service on Superbowl Sunday 2017!"}
{"text":"What does one do to reward themselves after hours of moving in and out of apartments? Go to Bar Italia, sit in the sheltered-yet-still-outdoor patio, press your palms flat on the white marble and have a great meal. That is just what I did, mother/moving partner in tow. 

Bar Italia's got the whole patio thing figured out. I'm pale, I don't want to sit right in the sun but I would love the breeze and outdoor feel. That's just what I got. 

The meal started off with a warm mushroom salad with walnuts, celery hearts, and parmesan cheese (the real deal, shaved slices, not the powdery stuff).  It was such a nice and refreshing start with a glass of white wine to top off the experience. 

Onto pasta. I seldom go to Italian restaurants without hitting this carb up, in any form. I got the fettuccine with chicken, sundried tomatoes, fresh basil and parley in a cream sauce. Perfectly cooked pasta, a generous offering of all the above components, and sheer creamy-but-not-too-creamy deliciousness made this one a winner. A waiter even came over thinking I was done, but there was no way I was giving that last bite up. I finished it. I love that it didn't come in ridiculous size. Still a good portion, still more than enough, but edible in one sitting unlike the heaps upon heaps of pasta I see in other places. 

Ah, I feel more relaxed even as I write this review. Who needs yoga? Bubble baths? Long walks on the beach? Go here."}
{"text":"I've never been more disappointed or upset by a restaurant, ever. I usually try to find some kind of redeeming quality - this place doesn't have one. I don't even want to spend the 5 minutes to give a play by play for this review, that's how annoyed I am. To keep it simple: horrible service, sub-standard food, rude management, and expensive. 

If you have a group, go somewhere else. If you want to go out on a Saturday night, choose another restaurant. If they seem like they're busy, don't go in. If there is a festival outside - run far away from here!

There is no excuse for making people wait 45 minutes for a glass of wine and then another hour for hard, cold chicken and soggy salad (that was just my dinner). The server had been working for about 12 hours, was grumpy and couldn't care less about us. She also lied a number of times to our group. The manager was rude and was pissy with us when making simple requests like \"can we have a pitcher of water...\". After complaining about the service and food, what did we get? No refunds, no apologies, not even a thank you for dropping hundreds of dollars at their restaurant. Very disappointing. Will I be back? HA! Never. I hope you, dear reader of this review, that you won't either. I couldn't bear you wasting your hard earned cash."}
{"text":"We often go here but I have to say, last nights service was horrible.  The restaurant was virtually empty - the server forgot to order two appetizers and one of our mains - I actually told him he was screwing up - then they started to trip over each other - but the experience was spoiled.  Food was good, but not good enough to return there.  They need to turn up their game and get better staff."}
{"text":"In Toronto with my family and had a really nice experience at Bar Italia.  Not much a Little Italy in Toronto, but that doesn't take away from this place.  We got a table right on the street.  Great for kids since they can make most pastas and sauces for the little ones. Mine had the Rigatoni Vodka, of course I sampled it, excellent.  My wife and I split a crostini with arugula and ricotta with fresh figs for an appetizer.  She had the fettuccini bolognese and I had spaghetti with their homemade spicy sausage.... All well prepared, full of flavor.  Combined with a nice red wine we ordered, it was a really fulfilling meal!

The service was attentive, friendly, and helpful as well!

Dessert.... The lemon tart was refreshing and tasty.  Their gelato was not good...seemed to be in the freezer too long.  The only glitch to an otherwise nice meal!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for many years. Have taken people from out of town here on many occasions and we generally have enjoyed it. Its nothing amazing, but its always decent. Last time we went will probably be my last. Bar Italia must have some managerial problems as the staff are totally incompetent. Our server seemed like she just arrived from Sudbury and was reading from a script. Had no clue how to interact, had no idea about the menu. Its like all the staff were sick and she is the alternate that gets called up a couple times a year to fill in. Had to ask over and over for simple things. When you are looking at your date, in a \"What the hell was that\" manner, more than once in an evening, you know somethings wrong. Get it together Bar Italia or you will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is, overpriced. We were three people for dinner, we all had an appetizer, entrée, and split a bottle of wine. This cost us 177$ + tip. Seriously? I understand it's Toronto and prices can be a little more than elsewhere, but I felt like I got robbed.

After being seated at the table and given menus, our waitress and the owner (?) or maybe he was the maitre d', asked if we were ready to order. When we said we weren't, they literally hovered over our table, pens at the ready. Seriously? Give us some space and time to make a choice. It's not like there was a line out the door and the restaurant was packed.

For the entrée, I had the Grilled Octopus Insalata. If by grilled octopus, they meant cold and rubbery, it was spot on. My wife had teh Calamari and it was well, it was calamari, we've had worse and we've had better. My friend had the bruschetta and well it's hard to f***-up bruschetta

For the mains, I had the Pollo Parmigian, well it was essentially chicken with some cheese thrown on it and warmed up and thrown on an ice cold plate. This was in direct contrast to my wife's plate, of spaghetti bolognose, which we have to assume was prepared by Chef Mike, as the plate was piping hot and the past warm and a bit gooey. Chef Mike, isn't the chef of the restaurant, that is our pet name for anytime we suspect our meal was prepared in microwave. I can't remember what my friend had, but, it couldn't have been great, as I don't recall him saying a word.

One last word about the wait staff. When serving water, go to the side of the table the person you are going to pour for is on. Do not lean across the table and pour. (A), it is rude, (B), I don't need someone's arm in my face, and (C) it's kind of gross to have your armpit hovering over my plate.

If you are starving and have to eat somewhere, I suggest going across to the Metro grocery store and picking up a sandwich."}
{"text":"We went here for the Little Italy Festival to grab a few drinks. Mr. H had the chardonnay and I had the red wine sangria, both were around $11 which I thought was pretty expensive. The sangria was good though and we shared an appetizer, crostini gorgonzola. Unfortunately I had forgotten that I don't like gorgonzola, so I didn't enjoy it much. However, people next to me were eating pasta and it smelt and looked really good. 

I may go back if I'm in the area again :)"}
{"text":"I came here for Ryan F's birthday, but also invited some fellow yelpers (Laura C., Vivian W., Simon C., and Alexey T) to Bar Italia. I looked at their website to preview the menu and it seemed like the restaurant offered a wide and tasty selection of Italian fare. I also glanced at their 'photo' section and noticed a round table - nothing irks me more than having people sit in one long table where conversations are isolated to your immediate left and right. Round tables invite everyone to the conversation and no one is excluded.

So, I reserved the only round table at the restaurant for 9 people. 

Intro. I was the first to arrive and the hostess (also our waitress) greeted me very professionally. She asked if I was Charlotte, to which she responded it was a pleasure to meet me and handshake. She led me to my table, offered to hang my coat, and mentioned that Friday's were $6 martini nights!

WARNING! There are 3 coat hooks by the round table so that if you are the first one to put your coat on a hook, be prepared to have hundreds of other coats on top of yours. In other words, if you want to leave early, you will have to fish for your coat which I found not cool.

Food. I ordered the Buffalo Mozzarella salad which is nothing new or extraordinary, but if filled my hungry spot quickly. I also ordered one of their special's which consisted of Bucatini Pasta. I immediately thought that it was a play of Bucatini All'Amatriciana but I soon found out that it wasn't. While delicious, the sauce wasn't like the Sugo Amatriciana I remember tasting in parts of Rome. At the end of the day, the pasta was delicious, but it didn't wow me.  

For dessert, Ryan F. and I shared the Panna Cotta but to my utter disappointment, it tasted like dense saffron. Next.

Service. The night was busy and I remembering the waitress apologizing for the extremely long wait because the restaurant had an unusually high volume of patrons. Now, I am not sure what to make of that excuse because first of all, reservations are an indication of how many people will be at the restaurant. A good restaurant will take into account how many patrons will be eating and at what time...no?

18% was automatically added to the bill of 8 or more. Although we were 9 in total, we decided to get separate bills. I paid for Ryan F and our bill for two came out to be $225 which is, in my opinion, expensive. To be fair, I added a bottle of Prosecco ($49) to my bill for the table, but to give you a sense - Bar Italia is not cheap.

Because there are restaurants a-plenty on College Street, I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"4 stars for the restaurant alone but 5 if you take advantage of the band upstairs on a Friday or Saturday night.

What in the world am I talking about? I'm talking about \"Shugga\", the R&B, soul, hip-hop, funk band that plays a mean set upstairs starting at 11pm every Friday night. The singer sings the ENTIRE set in falsetto with lots of songs that make you want to move (and move people do). The walls are red velvet, the lighting is dim, and the crowd is late twenties and up (and UP!)

The restaurant itself is crowded, in my favourite kind of way. They pack you in, table to table so you can hear the people next to you if you felt so inclined (but you should go with company good enough that you don't want to listen to the people next to you because you're too absorbed in your own titillating conversation.) The lighting is dim. They have booths for bigger groups. A patio that seats 20+ people. It's fantastic.

The servers are casual and friendly but still keep a level of professionalism that I love. The food is fresh, classic and at times, inspired. They have specials every day, and their menu is definitely NOT too long (7-8 pasta dishes, 5-6 secondi's, 10-12 appetizers and a few sandwiches to choose from). Plus a couple daily specials.

If you're going on a Saturday make sure you make a reservation or you won't get in.

Do go on a Friday for the music. It's $10 cover if you come just for the music (which is well worth it) and free if you eat there before hand.

Anyway, this is the perfect way to spend a groovy weekend night and makes a spectacular date (or double date)."}
{"text":"Good dinner was had by myself and my companion at Bar Italia on Monday February 24. We were there around quarter to 7 in the evening and at first were the only patrons in the place, but it filled a bit more later on. Blame it on Monday! Anyways, they were out of calamari, but the same bed of mixed greens was a gracious host to a few delicious and garlicky seared shrimp. Our other appetizer was one of the most interesting I ever tried in any Italian restaurant.  2 pieces of grilled crusty bread, each spread with herbed ricotta., and on top of it arugula, prosciutto, shaved parmigiano reggiano and fresh fig. Very good and original, great flavour combo! The mains now. My companion had vitello ai funghi,veal scaloppini with shiitake mushroms, al dente broccolini, shallot jus and a generous sideof gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce. I had spaghetti puttanesca. A textbook version with capers, black olives, anchovies,chopped tomatoes with a nice addition: seared filets of sardines. Fresh, good and real sardines, not stinky kippers from a can. Wine was a half liter of Ripasso and the split dessert was a slice of chocolate truffle cake. Capuccino and doppio espresso macchiato finished the meal.

Now the pros. This kitchen is good. Not the best (Buca, Noce and even La Bruschetta are leagues ahead in my book) but the food is delicious and reliable without being overly original. Worthy of repeat visits,especially with a group as the prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is trendy without any hipster vibe.

Two things that sightly annoyed me: no debit payment available. Credit or cash only.  Also, maybe it was because it was a slow night, but I thought our waiter, while very friendly was a tad  agressive on the upselling. No need to insist on the chocolate cake before the antipasti arrive!

Anyways, for 150. 00 for 2, it is good overall but not memorable."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week and it was good! The spot itself is pretty cool - one part 50s dinner/restaurant, one part stylsh. Black pleather booths line one side and benches with tables lines the other. The servers were lovely and even hung up my coat! 

It was about $20 for lunch, with no apps or drink. But, as someone who is very sensitive to onions... the salad came laden with them in the dressing.  It's okay to pick them out when dining with friends, but this was a meeting so it was sort of embarrassing! In my humble (and onion hating) opinion.. something as aggressive as onions should be mentioned in the description!"}

Overall my meal was calamari as an app and split the gnocchi with my friend. Both were delicious. And the white sangria was perfect! Service was on par and food was quick and delicious."}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on ambiance! But I'm a fan, and would love to go back for an entire meal!

After dinner at Utopia we were looking for a good dessert spot and stumbled across BI - they had a lovely dessert menu that was reasonably priced. There was tiramisu, chocolate tort, some sort of lemon tart dessert and a good selection of tea to accompany. They also had biscotti for $2, it wasn't too hard, and just the right amount of sweetness (chocolate & almond). 

It's a really neat spot - cool decor, big comfy round booths, WICKED light fixtures, it was just right for a hot beverage and a sweet.

Heads up - the hot chocolate isn't sweetened, they offer sugar with it, but it didn't receive a favourable review from my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Came here for a Wednesday lunch at noon on a cool, sunny spring day.  Just walked a block or two along College and it was one of the first place we found that was actually open and looked like it would have an acceptable menu.

Greeted immediately upon entrance.  Long and narrow inside.  Booths and tables.  Modern, chic, simple with some interesting designs but nothing that really stands out or is memorable.  Several casual tables outside, some in the shade some in the sun.

Friendly enough service.  Prompt.  No complaints.

Good chicken fettucini lunch portion with sundried tomato with parsley & basil ($11.95).  Big enough without being too filling.  Available without the meat for a dollar less if I remember correctly.  If we hadn't been in a little bit of a rush to get back to work, I would've been tempted to try a salad or dessert.  And of course wine. 

But those will have to wait for another day when yes, I would go back.  Would like to try for dinner in the summer on a Friday perhaps when there's a crowd, to get a true feeling of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"With a handful of visits under my belt, this morning's brunch at Bar Italia was another friendly reminder of what a great resto-bar this place really is. I have to note that BI has one of the best brunches I've had in the city in a long time. Excellent selection and reasonably priced ($8-$13 mains). 

As we were a group of 8+, they reserved a large table for us: oval-shaped and conducive to seeing/chatting with everyone. Perfect. I ordered the French toast - stuffed with lemon-infused ricotta, dusted with cinnamon, and topped with fresh fruit and pure maple syrup: a little taste of heaven. A sample of the eggs benny, omelet, and homemade waffle yielded similar results.

Whether my visit has been for drinking at the bar, late-night dinner or dessert, BI never disappoints. The service each time has been seamless and the staff members are friendly and accommodating. The lunch, dinner, and dessert menu selection is just as exceptional. 

Honourable mentions: 
- Patio area facing College St. 
- Live music Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night upstairs
- The best flourless chocolate truffle cake. Ever.
- A fine selection of scotch and whiskey"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of months ago on a date night for the first time and it was absolutely horrible. Our server was really rude, forgetful (had to keep asking for water to be refilled) and grumpy. She was clearly miserable and frustrated. The food itself was dismal. My date had a pasta that was luke warm at best and I had a gnocci that was drowning in oil; I couldn't even finish it. The whole expierence really put a damper on our evening and we will not go back."}
{"text":"I like the upstairs part a lot. Great for any type of occasion. Downstairs is chaotic! I know I went on a Saturday night but it's the loudest restaurant I've ever been to. It was like sitting in a wind tunnel at some point. The lights kept getting dimmer and dimmer so all of a sudden I was deaf and blind :P
Food is so-so. Nothing spectacular . Service was good though so thanks for that!"}
{"text":"We went here for winterlicious. It was a birthday  party and about 10 people. I had been here before and it was nothing special. 

The thing that killed our experience was the service. We asked for water for the table at the beginning of dinner. We received 2 glasses somewhere in the middle. and then after asking several times, we were given 2 more glasses of water. 

Some people asked for coffee with desert. Well the desert plates and cutlery had been cleared for about 10 minutes before the coffee came out. 

In regards to the food; had the crostini with chopped eggplant and other veggies. Really good taste but it was 2 ridiculously small sized bites. I ordered the sirloin for the entree. Although the gravy was pretty good, the entree in its entirety was lacking salt and pepper and just seasoning in general. My friend who had the salmon with lemon and herb risotto, said his entree was bland as well.
Desert was a raspberry and lemon ricotta slice. Good but nothing overly special. 



Overall, won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Laura C. summed up a lot of the items that were right and wrong with our night at Bar Italia.  

First, loved the group tables they had.  The table we were at, was an oval table that allowed our group to be very intimate but also not too crowded in having our meals.  I often find that restaurants opt for the small tables to maximize the 1 or 2 people client groups that come in.  Fully understand the need, but it often results in a lonnnng table with people dispersed in a fashion where you can really only talk or engage the 3 people in front of you and the 2 people beside you.  So this was a nice novelty to have.  We were at the wooden oval table tucked in behind the stairs but there was an equally nice square table right at the entrance.

Service wasn't bad.  Our waitress seemed very efficient when we came in, almost dictatorial in a Steve Jobs fashion.  She was very specific on how food needed to be brought out to the far corner of our table (hardest for a server to reach) which spoke to some sort of plan, but when the food came out in multiple orders, this plan seemed to hinder instead of support the event and service.  Seemed odd that the other waiters wouldn't take drink orders, only she was allowed to, even though at least 3 waiters seemed to assist on our table.  

I don't know if its a reflection on her or the kitchen on the long wait time for appetizers + main course + most items as the night progressed (which lead to cold meals).  I do understand that the place seemed to be really bustling but I am of the opinion that its at the bustling moments that you need to pick up your game because great service in busy times can be the BEST marketing you can invest in.  

My food was good.  Had the lamb special and it hit the spot, but I am a little cautious to overly rave because by the time i got it, I was starving. 

Yelpers don't lie, the panna cotta is good!

It speaks volumes that after the meal, I was still hungry and stopped for street meat...my food was good but the long waits made me hungry :(

Overall I think I would come back, but maybe not in a group (even though they have great tables!!!)  Given all the other reviews it may have been an off night for Bar Italia for me and my friends."}
{"text":"This was just really bad. There was no flavor to any of the meals, and with a table of 16, I tried at least five dishes. I had the Spaghetti Bar Italia, and it failed all expectations, although being a classic meal.  It was overly expensive--for a tasteless, milky gnocchi soup it was 28 dollars. They offered us free appetizers due to our over 40 minute wait (with reservation), but unfortunately, the only good snack was the bruschetta. The serving staff was very rude and was obviously not trained to deal with large amounts of people, as my group was treated horribly with eye rolls and an overall unfriendly tone. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is very enjoyable, but I do not recommend going here for a good experience."}
{"text":"I've always marveled that this place has been open as long as it has. There never seems to be a crowd when ever I pass by. We came here for lunch. The place was pretty sparse, and our service was still a little slow. We didn't mind though as we were in good company. I had a panini, and I have to say that it was yummy and perfectly made. I tried my friend's mushroom pasta and that too was top notch. I would come here again if I wanted to go to a nice restaurant where I don't have to shout to have a conversation."}
{"text":"My best friend's birthday party brought me back to Bar Italia.  The restaurant was quite busy when we arrived but luckily we had resos.

The reason why I didn't give it the full 5 stars rests in attention to detail. Forgetting to bring us requested separate bills and my Lychee Martini that came once with and the other without an actual lychee.  Another reason was a few of the dishes weren't up to snuff. For one the Osso Bucco wasn't as tender as it could've been, and the Papparadelle Bolognese was unimpressive.

The feature salad - Citrus Fennel was fresh and light topped with Parmesan and pomegranate seeds. A great starter!  The calamari was also one of the best I've had and was cooked perfectly and had a nice charred flavor to it. 

For my main I ordered the Papparadelle di    Mare which consisted of egg noodles tossed with shrimp, mussels, bay scallops and calamari and finished off with a tangy tomato sauce. I loved the sauce and noodles!

Also tried the Gnocchi Gorgonzola, which I found to be a bit \"pasty\" tasting.  The prosciutto was very salty and the Gorgonzola was too mild.

The Ricotta Cannelloni was divine. The filling was nice and creamy and then topped with a tangy tomato sauce.

Desserts were also superb. The Panna Cotta is smooth as can be and the Tiramisu was amazing; just the right amount of coffee flavor.

Bill for 5 people with 7 drinks and a bottle of Malbec was a little shy of $300 with tax and tip - well worth it! I definitely recommend Bar Italia!"}
{"text":"2.5 Review 
It seemed to have a lot of potential, but in the end didn't meet our expectations. 

We can here for dinner on a busy Friday night for Charlotte W and Ryan F 's birthday. What we were really liked was the oval table we requested when making a reservation. It fits 9 people. There was also a large square table in the front that seemed to fit the same. Highly recommended if you come here with a large group. it was perfect for conversation, and I wish more restaurants would follow suit. 

The atmosphere is modern and clean.  It was a bit noisy, but seemed everyone heard me okay. The chairs were a bit uncomfy, and after sitting for 3.5 hours (I'll get to this) my back really hurts. 

Most of us arrived at 6:30, and after she told us the specials our order wasn't taken until at least 7:30. It is true we were engaged in conversation and noticed only afterwards.  Ordered our apps, which came later. I did notice that our entrees only came past 8:30 and we left at 10pm. It was a long meal, but could have been faster. Nonetheless, with good company we barely noticed, it was okay. Would have been more annoying in a date situation. 
It was also quite dark, and the dimness messed up my eyes a bit, but I think this was only in our section. 

We got one of the appetizers to share, Pan seared SCALLOPS with grape tomatoes, pancetta and wilted greens. For $11 there were only 4 scallops, 4 half tomatoes and a few leaves of spinach. It was tasty, and but didn't seem worth it. 

For my main, I was looking very much forward to my GNOCCHI GORGANZOLA ($15). The description boasts mushrooms in a veal truffle reduction with gorganzola cheese. I was comtemplating this for a few days actually, and whether I should have such a high intake of creamy/cheesiness which will make me feel nauseous. When I got it, I was disappointed that it tasted nothing like cheese, and although the sauce was flavourful, the gnocchi tasted really plain. There were bits of crunchy pancetta, which was a nice addition, but it just made everything extra salty.  Compared to the creamy decadent pasta I had at bar vespa last week, this was incomparable.

AT got the Veal Scallopini ($22). We did mention to the server that this dish (and another at our table) was cold.Note it already took two hours to get the dish, didn't want to wait any longer. She didn't really do anything about it, except say sorry. It wasn't reflected at all in our bill. 
The Veal was okay, but flat and dry, only the sauce seemed to make it bearable. 

For dessert, we got the Chocolate Truffle Cake ($7). It's flourless, so I think this will work with the gluten free crowd, but tread carefully. It's extremely rich, so make sure to have water in hand. 

Overall, I would give the food a 2.5-3. I know some others in the group had better dishes and were pleased. You'll probably find their review here too. 

Our service wasn't terrible. She was friendly. Not sure if it's her fault or the kitchen that the food was slow, but I think waiters should have a hand in managing this if it's gone to the wayside. Our food temperature should have been handled better. Sometimes when filling water, she would fill for half the table, maybe she couldn't see because it was dark. 
She did, however, gladly split the bill every which way for us, without giving us a hard time, and took all credit cards. Even told our where the closest ATM was. 

It's 18% mandatory tip for large groups. Unfortunate that we were forced to pay this even though I am a strong believer that tips are a voluntary monetary reflection of the satisfaction of their service. And since it wasn't amazing, we wanted to show that, but couldn't. Oh well. Do you think they try less hard because they know this? I guess if they made the mandatory tip less, people might pay extra on top of this. But I digress, this is another discussion. 

There is a live band upstairs, but we didn't bother to stick around for it. $10 cover, but free if you've eaten there and get escorted by your server. I wish we would have stayed (re: Madelaine's review), but with the heavy cake, and already been sitting for a while, we just couldn't stay."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me but I find the waitresses here overly arrogant, its really a turn off since the food is good."}
{"text":"The problem here was that there was too much to choose from. At times like this I wish I had an expandable stomach - seriously, how else am I going to try all the good food?!

I settled on an old classic - whole wheat spaghetti. It was the only sure way of determining if I'd be back (you do a classic right and I'll be back, right?). Well, I wasn't disappointed in the least - loaded with extra veggies and marinara sauce, the spaghetti was absolutely delectable. 

My friends ordered the Mixed Grill (where you get a little of everything) and the Gnocchi and they couldn't stop raving either! Apparently, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was an old haunt for me back in 2000, and this was my first visit back since I moved back this year. 
I had expected it to be frozen in time (a good thing) : timelessness is something I value. 
Service was perfect.  Food was what I expected. But the restaurant itself is more than tired: it's beaten up. All the marble topped tables are chipped - many with 4 broken corners; the bar stools are mismatched.and placed inattentively, the hallway to the washrooms is filthy and in an  embarrassing state of dusrepair, there's peeling paint in the dining room. There's nowhere to look without seeing something filthy broken or wo
 
The design is a classic and the condition of the restaurant is just plain disrespectful.  
It needs LOTS of TLC.  I hope it receives it."}
{"text":"I came here tonight for a birthday dinner with my girlfriends. As we were seated, our waiter told us about the $6 Martini promotion... BONUS! It was sheer coincidence that there was this promotion after talking about our favorite martinis on our street car ride to Bar Italia.

Both the exterior and interior of this joint are aesthetically pleasing. Portion sizes are generous and is reflected in the price. My main course was the risotto - filled with vegetables and chicken. I was impressed! For dessert I had the panna cotta, which is made on site. It was absolutely delicious and I would recommend to anyone. It was sweet, but not too sweet that you couldn't enjoy the dessert.

I would like to come back in the summer when I can down a couple of martinis while looking out on to College Street.

In short, I recommend:
- Lychee martini as a cocktail
- Risotto as a main
- Panna Cotta as a dessert"}
{"text":"had visitors from Vancouver, took them for week night dinner on the patio, great spot, got rock star parking, started off nice.. yummy drinks, great service, then the food came... we all ordered salads to share and pasta.  my mushroom salad was pretty good, but i thought the pastas were pretty mediocre.  Pusateri makes better pasta.. sorry..!"}
{"text":"Rampant posts on facebook and social media that this Bar is racist and unprofessional. We do not welcome this type of behaviour in Toronto."}
{"text":"I sat on this tiny little patio that I had to literally climb over a few people to get to but once seated, it was surprisingly comfortable and not at all intrusive if you wanted a private conversation. 

The inside had a great vibe and was quite romantic with candlelight, as many of the other restaurants in the area have, and upstairs was a lounge type of place with couches to sit on, a bar that had some great lighting around it and a DJ playing some decent music. Bathrooms are downstairs and are decently clean and smell pretty good for being in the basement. 

They had $6 martini's that day (Friday) and some decent tasting food. Everything seems decently priced and matched the taste of the food, I felt that the side of rapini that my partner ordered was overpriced and underwhelming. I was dying to try the tiramisu but it looked quite small and didn't have the stomach for it after eating a large portion of food.

Most people sat there and ate and chatted and stayed long after they finished eating for some more drinks and good conversation. Great place for a date as it has a romantic feel and isn't so loud that you have to scream at each other."}
{"text":"On of the best places in the city to host a party, Bar Italia serves up consistently good food in a fun and laid-back atmosphere. Prices are affordable and the live music upstairs on weekends can be a lot of fun. I've hosted and attended parties of 8 to 40 people both upstairs and downstairs at this College Street hotspot. 

The selection of martinis and mixed-drinks along with a highly accessible wine list makes this a great (and easily accessible) place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Friends Birthday dinner preceding drinking.

I had the Gnocchi Gorgonzola, which had a chalky texture when I bit into it, & tried a bit of Ricotta Cannelloni which was very good.

Desserts,  The Panna Cotta was smooth &the Tiramisu had the optimal amount of coffee flavour.

Overall I liked that interior & decor, the food was good & wait staff were attentive."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim on a Saturday night at 8p for a group of 6. Where in Toronto's good spots could a group like that really get a seat? Not at Bar Italia. But the hostess was nice enough to offer up a reserved table if the group does not show. Just as she's telling us, the first of the group shows.

But fear not, there is another table eating dessert and should not be long we're told. But it'll probably be at least 15-20 mins. Well at least they were nice enough to offer. We did end up staying because we didn't want to go back into the cold.

So as we sat down, the server was nice to offer us the complimentary water. And as we perused our menu she told us about the specials. 

The octopus salad was very nice appetizer to start. Many pieces off grilled octopus over top of a few pieces of greens. I know I got the better end of deal with many grilled octopus, but I wanted a few more greens with it.

I had the Casarecce, this longish though not spaghetti long pasta with some eggplant, peppers, olives, tomatos in EVOO. I felt it was nice and light, still with good flavor. And wasn't heavy which is what I wanted.
I also tried the gnocchi, the thing I always found with gnocchi is you can't eat too much of it. You eat a few and you are done. Nothing different here. The mushrooms (oyster and portabello) were plenty and the veal reduction sauce was quite nice though I found a bit salty.

The thing I find with good Italian restaurants is when you want to eat pasta, there is never one pasta that has all the ingredients you want to eat. A good mixture of meat and the good veggies. And if there is, everyone gets it. This place is the former, all the pastas sound great but it always seems to miss one ingredient, in my case it was some meat. Can't have it all I guess.

I read a magazine this morning, apparently this is Atom Egoyan's local hangout. Too bad I have no idea what he looks like. But if you do, be on the lookout."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dinner destinations in Little Italy, and maybe even in the city.
Both of my experiences with Bar Italia have exceeded expectations. On my most recent visit, I had the caprese salad, which I remembered (and raved about) from my first Bar Italia experience months earlier. It did not disappoint.  For my entree, I had the egg noodles with bolognese sauce, which was simple and delicious. Some of the best pasta I've had outside of Italy. I highly recommend the lemon tart for dessert. In the sea of Italian restaurants on College St, this one is sure to impress!"}
{"text":"A solid choice if you are in the area.  It's a large restaurant that can definitely hold a big group.  There is also a decent size patio in front.

Was here for lunch and our server was so nice and friendly.  The lunch menu is kinda disappointing in terms of selections - a few apps, and then lots of salads and sandwiches.  There is only a pasta of the day and no pizzas.  The wine/beer list is pretty decent.  

I had the grilled shrimp salad with some lemon vinaigrette.  Overall a good dish, but nothing to make my taste buds explode.  We also shared a mushroom and goat cheese dish - it would have been better if they had put some oil on the bread before putting the mushrooms on...something so the toast wasn't so dry.  

If you want t come here just for drinks, there's a a bar at the front where you can just chill and dream of eating pizzas....elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely dinner with my big sister at Bar Italia last night!

This restaurant has a very funky vibe with soft lighting, cool interiors and great service.

From the moment my sister and I walked in, we were greeted by the help and warmth of their staff.

The food at Bar Italia was absolutely delicious and was not too badly priced.

For an appetizer, my sister and I split the shrimp cocktail, which comes with a few HUGE shrimp, complete with seafood sauce to dip into and a mixed green salad on the side.

For our main courses, my sister had the rigatoni with spinach and cheese which was dressed in a flavourful rose sauce.

I had the risotto, which was an amazing mixture of rice, smoked chicken, spinach, plump cherry tomatoes and was dressed in asiago cheese. The combination was just heaven when it came to my palette.

For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate truffle cake, which was rich and literally melted in our mouths.

The final bill came out to $60, which is not horrible for a full meal complete with appetizers and dessert.

I would recommend Bar Italia because the food is good quality, the service was friendly and the atmosphere is really warm and nice.

Also, they apparently do private events if you are looking for a party venue."}
{"text":"This place is has a nice small patio that I was able to enjoy, a rarity in Toronto. The space inside is very nice with booths along one side, banquettes on the other, a mixture of light wood and dark leather, and a big opening to the kitchen, I love when restaurants do that.

The upstairs lounge area is even nicer with red velvet walls, white banquettes, dark flooring, a good sound system, and great mood lighting it is very rare to find a place to get both good food and good music in a good environment. 

As much as I wanted to stay inside the weather was so perfect I had to take advantage of it and turned out to be great. Although the patio is small and may be a little crammed the service outside is just as speedy and charming as it is on the inside. The waitress was very nice, accommodating, funny, and really knew her stuff when it came to specials, drinks, and pairings.

Food is good. I don't recommend the vegetable crustini as it is not very flavorful and the crustini as more stale chewy bread than a thin cracker like bread. I had the seafood pasta for dinner and it was good. I wouldn't say it is the best pasta I've ever had, but its pretty good and the portion is large. You get shrimp, muscles, bay scallops, and calamari all in a wonderfully light tomato and herb sauce. I was full half way through but it was just so good I ate it all. My one complaint was that a lot of my pasta stuck together and being an Italian place, you just gotta make the pasta right, flavors were good though. The bread served up is also very good.

Overall, it's a great place to have food and a few drinks. Service is awesome and the lounge upstairs has a good vibe. Makes life easier for those indecisive people out there that wanna do dinner and do something else afterward, this place has both dinner and nightlife. Prices are decent and pasta portions are good. Rapini sides are great but $5 for rapini is almost crazy."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I've always enjoyed my experience. The food is good, the setting is nice, and the desserts are exceptional. 

There are a number of good pasta dishes - I've never had a bad experience but none are particularly memorable either - I do, however remember the flourless chocolate cake and lemon tart the most. And the service here is top-notch.

With so many scattered options are Little Italy, this is one that consistently delivers."}
{"text":"On Saturday night, my boyfriend and I along with another couple ventured to 'Bar Italia' for Winterlicious. I made my reservation with ease along with some alterations. 

Upon arrival, our fabulous 'U' shaped booth was ready for us and it was awesome along with the dim ambiance. It was incredibly busy (which is good for them) therefore resulting in a much longer than anticipated wait time for food/beverages. Luckily our group was laid back and in no rush but an apology for the extremely long wait would have been a nice touch. With that said, the food was definitely worth the wait; it was absolutely delicious! You could tell everything was fresh and made to order and the beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection; huge compliments to their chef. The desserts were amazing too and could tell were made on site. 

The service was alright as our server was attentive (although took a while to greet us) but in my opinion lacked personality and seemed run down. 

It also looked like there was a private function going on upstairs which is a nice feature of this restaurant; they also had a cute patio in the front for their summer patrons. 

All in all, a pleasant experience........the food would bring us back."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious on a Saturday night with a date.This restaurant has a very unassuming exterior which might not attract first-timers, however the interior is classy and romantically lit. There are probably 25 tables for 2-6 people which makes this restaurant great for dates but not so much for larger groups. The waitress serving us that night seemed standoffish and rather unhappy to be serving (her arms were crossed over her chest for most of the night) but everyone else was polite and friendly. 

In terms of food, Bar Italia serves some great dishes and some misses. Their Winterlicious menu offers three courses, with three choices each so my date and I were able to try 2/3 of the menu. For the appetizers, we ordered the Insalata Mista (very fresh and light; we particularly enjoyed the tomatoes) and the Polenta Grigliata (the mushrooms and the sauce were delicious; we're not too keen on polenta). For the entrees, we ordered the Bucatini all'Amatriciana, which I feel was a mistake on my part. The Bucatini was cooked al dente but I feel the sauce was too sour and the dish unremarkable. The Salmone alla Griglia, however, was divine - perfectly cooked and seasoned on a bed of roasted vegetables. My date cleared his plate in minutes. For dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu (quite good; strong espresso flavour) and the Torta Di Ricotta (kinda lumpy and bland). In hindsight, I think we should have ordered the chocolate tart instead. 

For $25, this meal was well priced. I'd give the food 3.5/5 (some dishes were a solid 5, but the pasta was disappointing for an Italian restaurant). The ambiance made up for some lost points and the service was overall A-okay."}
{"text":"I have been coming here ever since I lived in Toronto years ago and it was always a charming place.  Chic but casual.  

My fiend and I were in need of a good espresso and we thought that Bar Italia would be a great place to get a double.  We sat at the bar seated next to a former governor general.  I had no idea who she was but my companion seemed to think it was better that I did know who she was.  It wasn't Michaelle Jean.  She was the governor general when I lived in Canada.  I would eat a seal heart with her.  

Anyways, this says a lot about the variety and class of the people who come here.  The espresso was flawless.  Maybe my shots were enhanced by the choice pastry creations.  I don't think I have ever left this place without having had dessert."}
{"text":"Yikes...came here because of the convenience of having Paint Nite in that location but I would never make this place my first choice.  

I should have already clued in when there weren't that many people eating there when I walked in.  While our service was friendly and good, the food was mediocre at best. 

We ordered a caprese, the panino cubano, and the panino terracina and finally, the tiramisu.  The waiter kindly had the caprese split for us, which was nice.  The salad however, really lacked any flavour in their staple item, their cheese.  The mozzarella was watery around the edges and because of that, way too soft.  

I'm not sure how the panino terracina tasted as my friend had that but the panino cubano was also mediocre. The tenderloin lacked any flavour whatsoever as well as the pancetta.  Both these meats seemed like they were dunked in water and boiled.  The raddichio was much too bitter and the bread became soggy, I'm presuming because of the boiled meat and mayo.  

The tiramisu was much too dense and I felt like I was eating chunks of cream rather than a delicate light dessert.  

Overall, I definitely would not come back to this restaurant.  While we had a wonderful team who served us, they really should consult their menu again and revisit their flavours because it was just an epic waste of calories for me yesterday night."}
{"text":"Bar Italia is a wonderful place to hold an event.

STAFF
They are very easy to work with and will work with your budget.  They are very experienced in holding events and have employees that are knowledgable with AV equipment.

VENUE
The venue has both positive and negative aspects.
Positive
 - Great mood lighting
 - AV equiped. Meaning they have mircrophones, a projector, PA system
 - Elevated stage
 - Great looking chairs that they use on stage
 - a bar on the top floor
 
Negative
 - The room got REALLY hot during the event and it took a while for the AC to kick in
 - The 2nd floor itself is usually where they host events. I don't really like how narrow the place was.  You could fit about 8 people per row I believe. It felt really squishy for about 70 peiople

FOOD
I didn't really have any food that night so I can't really comment.

So if you're not picky about the room size and layout, this place is great to hold an event."}
{"text":"Very good service. Food is okay- not terrible but not amazing either. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Love love love Bar Italia!

As a student who is constantly in the city, specifically the College St. area, Bar Italia is a great place for a sandwich, great salad (Bresola salad!), a quick drink on their patio...but my favourite...Seafood Pasta. My friends and I go there specifically for this dish....and clearly so does half of the restaurant since the last time I was there about 50% of the crowd were also eating the same thing. 

Otherwise, the atmosphere is great, and so is the service."}
{"text":"I used to like this restaurant, but after tonight's experience I am not gonna get back there. It took one hour for them to bring our order, when they did, I had to return my pasta because of its taste. It was the first time I returned a food and the reason wad that it was bitter.
I ordered another food which got ready in 10 minutes, however when We got the bill my primary order was still on the bill probably because it was more expensive. Needless to say no compensation for us!"}
{"text":"I keep returning to bar italia for it's excellent service and succulent dishes. 

The menu is simple and the ingredients are always fresh. I have a wicked sweet tooth and without fail, the tiramisu or the flourless chocolate torte satisfy me every single time."}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been to in Little Italy. Poor waitstaff managed by irresponsible managers and the owner. The place was overbooked because they had seated people more than the capacity for a Eurocup game, thinking that a projector on a wide screen would make up for their crappy service. You would think it's quite foreseeable that the place would be packed for an Italy game so they would bring in more waitstaff, but NO. Two people for 200 people! 

First and last time here. Ciao Bar Italia!"}
{"text":"I go here every year as my Valentine's Day tradition. The food was stellar.

The server was awful.  Un bussed tables, inattentive,  I was constantly trying to get her attention for another drink.

Great Prix fixe menu with seasonal foods. Desert portion could have been a bit larger."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7 PM to find only one other filled table. The waiter gave us the 'specials' in a barely audible voice and walked away. When we did give our order, we were told the item we ordered off the menu  was not available. The menu was not great and neither was the atmosphere. If you want a nice evening out, keep looking."}
{"text":"Wonderful Staff!!!! Amazing Food!!!!! 
First time trying Bar Italia and definitely going back.

3 of us went for Winterlicious Lunch.  Tried the Appetizer, Crostini Funghi - bread was nice and warm and the mushrooms and goat cheese went well together on top of it.  A bit more goat cheese would have made it PERFECT but it was a nice appetizer; For main course, Panino Di Polpette Di Carne - Home made veal sandwich on a sourdough bread (MORE BREAD - oye vey I thought to myself after I ordered).  BUT, nice size portion, not too big.  Bread was warm fresh and tasty and the home made veal meatballs were delicious.  A bit more sauce would have been perfect but it was delicious nevertheless.  I asked for hot sauce and they gave me their home made hot oil which was wonderful., Torta Di Cioccoloata - ONE OF THE BEST DESSERTS IN THIS WORLD! WOW!!!!  by the time the girls tried to reach for another piece, I ate it all!  Mind you, it was fairly small but melted in your mouth and I couldn't help but devour it!

Great experience, beautiful place, waitress was wonderful and the food was exceptionally delicious !  The spaghetti and linguine dishes that the girls had were also really good and the salad has one of the best dressings I ever had.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Yummy lunch on a patio! Tasty sandwich. I was wondering around hungry and found this place. Glad I did."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night for a Paint Nite event. The restaurant look nice, but barely had any customer for dinner that night. I got the spaghetti bar Italia, it taste pretty good. Wasn't too wow by it. Overall, very nice looking restaurant, service was okay. Price was decent for food. Atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Update: Mad Crush Wine Bar is here now: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mad-crush-wine-bar-toronto (Bar Italia is closed. Long live College Street institutions. Their phone and website are offline. It says closed in OpenTable and blogTO. And friends found the doors locked a couple of weeks ago.)"}
{"text":"Bar Italia has a really chill vibe and is a great place to go with a group, or with a date. I've been in a group of about 7 or 8 and they were very accommodating, which is always nice. They also have cozy seating inside and a pretty nice patio. Food is always delicious, and priced accordingly. To me the menu seemed a little small but I think they change it up every once and awhile. 

Also, the other day I was walking by and noticed that they offered brunch, so I would say that is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I ordered gnocchi today from Bar Italia through Foodora and thought to give this place a try.. For $26 total I was expecting something different. The gnocchi did not taste authentic at all and rather as if they dumped some store bought fettuccini sauce on top and called it a day. Very unimpressed and it is very expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a latte, greeted warmly by the owner, very friendly wait staff, I was impressed to say the least."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for the lunch/dinner options but the chocolate ganache cake at Bar Italia is to DIE for. Maybe literally. It's essentially composed of just pure dark chocolate and heavy cream. Unbelievably good. It's definitely an indulgence but kinda nice if you're coming back from a movie at the Royal and want to have a sinful dessert."}
{"text":"Bar Italia is one of those Little Italy staples I'll happily go to with you if it's your jam, but I will never suggest it as an option. 

They do mussels, pastas, paninis and salads but no pizzas. They have a cute shaded patio right on college and drink specials. These things are mostly wins, save the lack of pizza. Pizza is my fave food group, so their utter disrespect of pies really gets my goat.  

Their sangria is too pricy for what it is: about half of a bottle of wine with a splash of brandy, cheap fruit and some soda for $39? Get a grip. No seriously. Get a grip on the rest of that bottle of wine and pour it in!"}
{"text":"We really did enjoy your quick dinner 

We came for dinner for my mom's birthday. I had made reservations via open table just to be sure our group of 6 would be ok. When we got there our table was all set and ready. 
I found the staff to be very friendly and attentive. We had informed them we were in a little rush as we had a play to see. They tried to accommodate us as much as possible. 
The food was very good. Very reasonable portion size for the price you pay. I got the octopus salad which I really enjoyed. My mom got the chicken parm which was also good. Someone else at the table got the lamb shank, although I didn't get to try it, I can say that it looked and smelled amazing! 

Overall I would come back here to try more of their dishes. Although not a huge menu, everything I had was good, their wine list was great, and the staff was friendly. The place was very clean and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Service was fast, food was yummy though nothing spectacular. I was going to get the gnocchi, but then changed my mind at the last second because my bf ordered it and I wanted to try a different dish than him. I was recommended the special by the waitress. Now this was my fault, I didn't ask exactly what it was and didn't quite understand what she said. She described it as delicate and delicious.
Boy was I shocked when a huge plate of meat arrived in front of me! Yes, it WAS delicious, but definitely not what I was looking. Again, I am also to blame for not asking more questions but I was also a bit perplexed why she would recommend something that is so different than my initial choice.

Regardless, it was still a nice resto, the gnocchi WAS delicious, and the service was good. I will likely come back and try another one of their dishes next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Friday evening with work friends - reservation for 11 people.  The restaurant is very cool and trendy looking.  We were seated in a nice spot.  
I ordered a stiff drink while we waited for the rest of our friends to arrive.  Menu looked good... everything was shaping up.  

I ordered the following app: 
Prosciutto e Fico Crostini - Shaved Parma prosciutto, herbed ricotta, arugula topped with shaved parmigiano reggiano and fresh fig.
OH SNAP!  It was so delicious.. and this app bumped my rating up by one star.  I had never had fresh fig before... this was outstanding.  The perfect blend of tastes and textures.  I'm going to try to make this at home.  

I ordered another drink since we were in for the long haul.  The restaurant was starting to get a bit hot and uncomfortable.  Luckily, someone came around with fresh cold water frequently.  She even made a joke that she would be careful not to put water into our whiskey glass.  So, she filled up my water glass... and then proceeded to fill up my other glass...WTF!  So I said,..\"Uh, you just filled up my whiskey glass..\"  I'll be honest, I don't think there was anything much left in there... but c'mon.  Okay... simple mistake.  
My party had started noticing at this point that while the wait staff are nice, we constantly have the wave them down for ordering more drinks, food etc.  

My main course was the: 
Fettuccine Bolognese - Fresh egg noodle pasta, home style meat ragu and shaved parmigiano reggiano.  

Meh... pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was meh. 

My friends and I wanted to go by this time as the service was not as attentive as we thought they should be.  
Plus.. they automatically add on 18% tip.  I forget whether this was because it was a large group, but we would of expected some better service if this tip was being added on.  And if they already know they are getting 18% on everything anyways, why aren't they bringing us drink after drink after drink.  

So... delicious, outstanding appetizer... everything else... meh, I'll try somewhere else."}
