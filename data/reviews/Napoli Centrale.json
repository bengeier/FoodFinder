{"text":"Best Pizza Toronto and this coming from someone who has lived in Naples. Staff were great also."}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas and salads, friendly and attentive service, great prices.

They care about making things properly, and it shows."}
{"text":"A truly authentic Napolitano experience. It starts with the ambiance, then the service and ends with an amazing meal!  We tried the  zeppolini,  the arugula salad, and the sausage and rapini pizza, then ended with a smooth espresso.
\"Alessandro fache na bona pizza o vero\"
It will definitely be our favourite hang out."}
{"text":"This place served the best pizza I have ever tasted. I am from Niagara Falls and you just cannot get this kind of pizza there. Friendly staff made this experience one that I will remember. We will be back soon - you can count on that."}
{"text":"We order our pizza from here often on Fridays. It's far and away the best pizza in the Annex and the dough is so good. We love to get the Donna peppa and margheurita. Also they always have very fast service and very friendly owners !!"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a really good authentic pizza and didn't want to revisit Pizzeria Libretto; they are overrated.  Found NC through Yelp and we are so glad we decided to try them out.  NC had the most amazing pizza ever! Parking was a breeze, restaurant was clean and spacious, a really pleasant restaurant for a family, couples or just hanging out with your friends.  They have a nice flat screen tv so you can watch as you wait for your food and a really nice bar.  The service was excellent, we were seated right away and the food didn't take long after we ordered.  My boyfriend ordered the Ragu pizza and he loved it.  I had the Ortolana pizza which had Mozzarella & grilled vegetables (they are very generous with the toppings!), it was delicious.  Although we were both very full we could not resist the restaurant made tiramisu.  The tiramisu was amazing!  The mascarpone was velvety, the ladyfingers were perfectly moist with coffee and the chocolate syrup was a delight.  It was the best we ever had, it took us back to Rome.  Make sure to ask for NC homemade hot sauce to add to your pizza, it is the best hot sauce I ever had.  They sell them in a cute small jar to take home if you like.  We would highly recommend Napoli Centrale to anyone who is looking or craving for really good authentic pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Toronto according to a very picky Italian friend obsessed with pizza places. The service is great,  the atmosphere nice,  and the pizzas are the best. Highly recommended for a night with friends!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the city in my opinion. Wonderful service and atmosphere. I have been several times and it has always been delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing pizza and the eggplant parmigiana is out of this world. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices. Why go wait in line at Libretto when you can walk right in to this place? So happy this restaurant moved into my neighborhood, I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Excellent food / pizzas cooked in a traditional wood fire oven. 
We came here on a quiet Monday eve with a party of 7. Friendly service and helpful towards the children in our party. GREAT fresh pizza and bread straight from the oven. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just great pizza    was at libretto yest which I love and by accident stopped in on way downtown because of a pitcher Margherita special sign outside     just blown away    hands down best pizza in Toronto    I asked and the owner hails from Naples which makes sense     seriously folks   try the pie here     it is insanely good"}
{"text":"Started with the complementary bread and olives which was great because we were very hungry! We ordered the diavola that had hot sopresatta which was a good amount of spice, and the margherita cotto e funghi (instead of ham also had the sopresatta) which was delicious and they were really accommodating with the subtitution. Pizza: A+ (traditional Neapolitan pizza just like Pizza Libretto). Service A+. Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place twice and they had shut the kitchen about half an hour before closing time, which was  really annoying.
Gave it a third shot; third time lucky and all and really glad I did. The pizza here is the most authentic pizza I've tasted outside of Italy.  It really is a true taste of Naples.

The service here is awesome, very knowledgeable and attentive staff.

Also, they serve this amazing chilli sauce with their bread; it's delicious."}
{"text":"We got takeout pizzas. They were very good - good crust and tasty toppings. I'd go back but only to eat in the restaurant. Atmosphere seemed cool and pizzas would probably be even better fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto few months ago and After trying the \"so-called\" best pizza in town, I was so disappointed. I'm picky about pizza. Last night, I was lucky to stumble upon Napoli Centrale. What a blessing!!!
The ambiance is fantastic, I love the brick walls, the soft (Italian) music in the background. As soon as you enter, you see the majestic oven at the end of the room, you immediately know that only delicious wonders can come out from it. The oven is imported from Italy and it is a wood oven (big plus!!) 
We ordered two pizzas: Diavola and Cotto and Funghi. both tasted delicious!! Perfect crust and the toppings were super fresh. We received their own bread as appetizer, it was flavored with rosemary, so good!!.
The owner (from Naples) was very friendly and service was terrific.
Prices are great and way cheaper that other overrated pizzerias.
Highly recommended, we will definitely go back (and soon!!)."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place in Toronto. The atmosphere is really chill and trendy, yet casual. I always get the diavola pizza and it's delicious! I would definitely recommend stopping by after a day of shopping!"}
{"text":"RECOMMEND
Although its a very simple interior, pizzas are very tasty!
Would defiantly recommend this place for REAL PIZZA!"}
{"text":"We started with the meatballs and then we had a Napoli Centrale calzone (huge-amazing!) and a special pizza with ragout sauce, sausage and smoked provolone... out of this world.
Service was prompt and friendly. Great for a date, for families or simply with friends. I m looking forward to my next pizza

P.S. Spicy sauce to die for."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Napoli more than I had expected!  I had the pizza Santa Lucia which was heavily anchovy-flavoured, which I'd recommend as long as you enjoy anchovies.  My friend seemed to quite enjoy her carbonara pasta, although I can't seem to find it on Napoli's website menu.  Everything is quite heavily salted, from the bread to the pizza crust, so just beware if you're watching your sodium intake."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizza I had . They did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me. Overpriced . I would prefer blaze Anyday."}
{"text":"Looking for the best Neapolitan pizza in Toronto? Head over to Napoli Centrale! What makes it so phenomenal? A crust that is crisp, softer as it gets to the centre of the pizza, but with a pillowy soft edge (under that crispy exterior) that provides the best chew; a tomato sauce that has just the right amount of acidity and fresh tomato taste; cheese that is melted just so with a beautiful flavour--in other words, perfection! It truly is. So do yourself a favour and try it yourself."}
{"text":"We called and made a reservation on a Saturday night. My wife and I ordered a glass of wine each and a pizza each. The pizza was incredible, just the way I like it. The crust was thin and very tasty. The sauce added magic with the flavor. I asked for prosciutto on my pizza and it came covered in it...it was so delicious. This is authentic Italian pizza. 

The size of the pizza is just right for 1 person. 
The atmosphere is casual and intimate.
The people working there are Italian...and they know their craft!"}
{"text":"I think it was alright, but not amazing to be honest! Salad was very wet and plain. Pizza... despite it being chewey like real napolese pizza, the flavors weren't as mindblowing? Just simple."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best I've ever had, to be honest. Too bad as I live very near by and would go frequently otherwise. Nice big room, good for big groups. For some reason there were 3 sizeable groups with children, and no grown up only tables, so keep that in mind if you are hoping for a more adult experience. As seems to be the trend now, the veg options were just not that enticing, and I found my veg pizza to be very lacklustre, didn't even like the sauce, and the crust was way over the top doughy for my taste. The crust I did not eat with the pizza, was nice with the left over salad dressing from the caprese salad, on which we generally agreed, the cheese slices were too thick (not enough tomato/basil). My son struggled with his sandwich, I think he found there was too much mozzarella. The salad he got with the sandwich was huge."}
{"text":"It was time for Perfect Pizza Quest iteration numero 6.  This is a UYE primarily organized by Namrata of YelpGTA fame.  

This night was converged upon by about a dozen willing participants at the area of Bathurst north of Bloor and south of Dupont at Napoli Centrale who on their website claim they are authentic Neopolitan which I'm realizing isn't that unique anymore in TO.  There are quite a few establishments who have this claim (VPN).

The dining area is deceivingly spacious and open.  You wouldn't know it by looking at the storefront but the inside is particularly wide and well lit.  The bar is to the right as you enter and the oven and prep area is open concept as well.  If you have a large 800+ degree oven you want to show that baby off am I right?  Some of the countertops around the oven appear to be treated concrete!  How cool is that?  

At the table we had 2 by the way, we already had water decanters as well as sliced pizza dough bread with olives and some type of pepper sauce.  The sauce is really tasty, it's as if they are in little baby food jars and I couldn't quite figure out what kind of peppers they used.  The color looked to be Scotch bonnet but they weren't that hot.  I should have asked.  The taste was great though, not too hot at all but tasty enough to dip with the bread AND use when you eat the crust of your pizza.

I started off with a salad as did my wife.  I had ordered a Grotto Azzura (Arugula, prosciutto, shaved parmesan, lemon and olive oil dressing) and she had the Mergellina (Mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, shaved carrot, corn, tuna, green olive, mozzarella).  The salads came in full size toss bowls.  They were large, I should have figured that since each was about 12 bucks but I wasn't ready for that size, just a small portion.  I ended up sharing mine out.  Each came with a serving tong.

For pizza I had ordered the Diavolo (rossa) as I normally do at these types of places (Smoked provolone, hot soppressata salami) and my wife had ordered a Napoletana (bianche - Sausage, rapini and fior di latte).  

I had mine and a slice of hers.  Both were very good.  I enjoy this type of pizza being that it's thin and chewy.  The crust at the edge seems a little thick but it's still good.  I used the hot sauce they provided to eat with the crust which was just great.  The Diavolo had a very nice salty taste to it.  The salami was nice and spicy and the overall flavor was rich with spice and bite to it.  The Napoletana was of course not as spicy since the sausage is much more bland but the rapini is a great combo with any pork in my books.  It was good but having the tongue for spice I have to say I enjoyed mine much more.

Over all the service was friendly.  It would have nice to not have to ask for more bread and water though but the service was still good and the food was what you would expect if a place claims to be VPN certified.  I enjoyed it at Napoli Centrale."}
{"text":"I like my pies... and I really like my pies neapolitan style...and I really really like my pies neapolitan and low key non high maintenance. If you're like me you'll like Napoli centrale. We started with the tuna salad and it was a meal on its own.
The quality of pizza joints is really improving in our big city and this establishment is up there in my books!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Napoli Centrale!

I first visited NC about a month ago after noticing it a few times passing by. I was curious to try the food based on how nice the place looked from the outside. 

When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who showed us to our seat. The restaurant has a warm, cozy feel to it, with the delicious smell of pizza, roasting garlic, and lasagna....just writing about it makes me hungry!

We decided to share a bottle of wine and the eggplant parmigiana to start. The eggplant was sooooo good!! Thin, perfectly roasted slices of eggplant were separated by a rich blend of cheese, tomato sauce, garlic, and herbs. I seriously wish I ate the whole thing myself! 

We then tried their special, which was a meat lasagna, and a vegetarian pizza. Though I don't eat meat, I heard nothing but rave reviews about it. And my pizza - what a pizza! The crust was perfectly thin, fluffy, and just all sorts of goodness. The sauce was amazing and the toppings were superb. 

What I liked most about this place was how friendly the staff was and how authentic the food tasted. I've been to a number of pizza places in the city and would definitely consider myself a pizza lover-bordering-snob. What can I say, I appreciate a good 'za. And this place definitely hits the spot! 

We returned again this past week and this time I tried a calzone (made deliciously vegetarian just for me!) and a pizza with sausage. Again, the service was wonderful and the food was amazing. 

I am so happy that Napoli Centrale has moved into our neighbourhood and cannot wait to make it part of my regular 'za rotation!

Bonus points: NC has this delicious homemade chili hot sauce that is soooo tasty to dip your pizza crust into. I want to take home a whole jar of this stuff! They also serve up delicious bread and assorted olives to start. Seriously, what's not to love!?"}
{"text":"Nice Neapolitan pizza, authenic Italian .. one of the best in town .. 
thank you guys, Grazie !"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! I am so lucky to live right next door. The atmosphere, the pizza, the salads, the espresso.....and the service are all A+. You gotta go....."}
{"text":"The service was really good. However we ordered our leftovers to take home and when we arrived the pizza had two cockroaches (probably from the box). We have not been able to recover from the shock this was. We think it is our responsibility to let others now about this experience."}
{"text":"I had carry out from this place, so don't really know how good the service is. It's a neighborhood pizza place with a wood oven and decent bar.  The pizzas have good crust, not too burned but i prefer that. The toppings were all good quality.  Some of them were put on after the crust was in the oven, which is fine -- the quality was good.  They also have a decent looking bar with what looked like 5 local brews on tap - I believe it was three amsterdams, a local IPA, and something else.  The space is pretty good too.  I'd like to eat in next time."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Toronto hands down!
Reminds me of eating pizza in Italy!
Also a great variety of white pizzas for those that aren't into tomato sauce.
Great place great service."}
{"text":"Take a pizza my heart.

5 stars to this beauty because of its food, warm service, and the crust (the wine might of also helped with the good vibes I had here).

Zappoline (pizza bites) - the inside is warm, cheesy and soft with a crispy outside. The perfect way to start your carb journey here.

We got two pizzas (one each). The first was with the classic tomato sauce and had Flor di latte, mozzarella, and a few other ingredients that slip my mind at the moment. It was absolutely deliciously, cooked perfectly with just enough sauce. You had to finish the crust too!

The other pizza was bianche, with olive oil. Adding to our carb heaven on this pizza was potatoes, but it wasn't overwhelming! The entire pizza felt light, savory, and just perfect for the rainy day we were in. 

I totally recommend this place for any time!! I'm definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try out this place after seeing all the great reviews on here. We were a pretty big group of 12. The interior is very spacious. They didn't have an issue accommodating us all at one table.

As soon as we arrived we were served bread, olives and a really delicious dipping sauce made in-house. The server was very prompt at getting our drinks. 

I ordered the Diavola (pizza with a tomato based sauce, spicy salami and mozarella). It took a while to get our pizzas since we were such a big group. The appetizers came pretty quickly though so we still had quite a bit of food.

The pizza was Neapolitan style. It tasted delicious but had a thick crust on the rims and was scarce on the salami. This seemed to be the case with all the other pizzas ordered by our group. I would rate the food 3.5 for this reason.

Overall a pretty good joint to hang out. They charged us a modest 15% group gratuity."}
{"text":"Other Yelpers have this place covered... Awesome house bread with a spicy paste, fantastic pizza, a ridiculously friendly server and a nice ambience, and the eggplant Parmesan appetizer is delicious. House wine is currently $8 a glass, food prices are totally reasonable."}
{"text":"It was ok. My Caprese salad was good with huge chunks of cheese. The Caesar salad was quite good with very crunchy croutons and lots of dressing as I like it. The pizza is alright but the crust isn't crispy enough, a bit undercooked. Nice large dining area and atmosphere. It's not a Neopolitan certified establishment."}
{"text":"This was by far the best dining experience I have had in a very long time. The staff was incredibly kind and friendly, the nicest restaurant staff I have ever experienced. 

The food and wine was absolutely delicious, the interior was welcoming, clean, and charming. I want to go back already! 

I don't live in Toronto but if I did, this would become my go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"This place is literally around the corner from me (don't stalk) and we've been meaning to stop in for a few months now. We finally went on a Saturday night, ordered a lovely salad (ended up being great, tasty, and huge - enough for 2). Marie was our server (she's from France) is is friendly, professional, and fantastic! we were brought a basked of bread and dipping oil while we waited for our food. She was the only server for what became a pretty full restaurant, yet we felt as though we were the only ones there! She suggested an (alcoholic) lemonade made with vodka (and gin too, I think) with some Limonata and YES! Order it! It was great! Then we ordered our respective pizzas. Very good. A notch below Pizza Libretto, but we'll be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in Toronto hands down! Beautiful local Italian wines and salads..u simply can't go wrong here..Do it!"}
{"text":"Gem in the annex. Pizza and pasta were great.  Taste authentic. Just like what I had in Italy in the past.  Staff was friendly.  Great price."}
{"text":"3.5* for food, pumped up for probably the friendliest server that I have ever met!  (Un grand merci a Marie.)

Located about 1.5 blocks North of Bathurst Station, in a quieter part of The Annex is this relaxed, casual, and warm pizza joint.

Homemade segments of bread with a roasted red pepper/cheese spread and green/black olives were complimentary.  

(I must mention this, but at the bottom of the bread basket was a napkin...that was stained with the red pepper dip, underneath the bread.  After that discovery, I sorta stopped eating the free bread.)

Ordered:  Ortolano (grilled veg) and Cappriosca pizza.  Both pizzas were pretty thin crust.  Sauce was fresh tasting.  Good portion as I was only the eat half of the pizza.  Really good pizza at a decent cost in a cozy spot!"}
{"text":"Reasonably good. The service was pleasant, but the room was cold. The dough was too thick on the perimeter of the pizza. Try the homemade hot sauce, though. It was tasty."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of Yelpers for the UYE pizza quest. Loved seeing them all! 

I ordered the Brie and Funghi pizza. It was good but I felt there was not enough mushroom. I also did not like the thick crust on the outside. It was def. nice and crunchy but I should have asked if there was an option to make it whole wheat. It was super filling. The crust did taste better when dipped with the hot sauce, which came w/ the complementary bread. 

Service was average. Our table was missing utensils and a cup (me). When the cup finally came (asked two times), it felt dirty on the outside and I ended up stealing/sharing with my hubby instead. Food came out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing warm friendly service and delicious apps and Pizzas! Who could ask for more?

We enjoyed the Zeppolinis - pizza dough wrapped prosciutto cotto, ricotta and mozzarella with their homemade pepper sauce on the side! So good.

A focaccia like bread basket came out with balsamic and olive oil and the homemade spicy pepper sauce and a bowl of mixed olives. Delicious and free!

The we each ordered a pizza - I don't now what we were thinking ! They were big. I had the prosciutto cotto and fungi Napoli and my husband had a Santa Lucia which had cherry Tomatoes, anchovies amd cappers. Amazing


Then we shared some gelato and a latte all for under 90 before tip.

Great place can't wait to go back with the family!"}
{"text":"Great place for a tasty pizza! I was very impressed with the delicious pizza here. I had a sausage and cheese pizza with an excellent spicy tomato sauce. Wine selection is very good and they serve Amsterdam beer. Friendly service and the seating is comfy and relaxed. This is my new default pizza place!"}
{"text":"This place is in my neighbourhood and it's awesome! the hot sauce is amazing and the pizzas are way better than Libretto, in my opinion. I love the quattro fromagi and my husband loves any of the red pizzas with meat on them. the exposed brick, hardwood floors, lighting, etc. make it look really cool and cozy too."}
{"text":"Food- I give this place a 5 star for its food for sure!!! Fresh Italian food that tastes amazing!!! Ordered the caprese salad, the rolled ham and cheese appetizers (forgot what it's called), and 2 pizzas including the marghareta pizza with arugula added and the diavola. AMAZING. highly recommend all. By far the best tasting caprese salad that doesn't shy down on its portions or cheese slices. Fresh and light. The pizzas were done quite quickly maybe about a 10 or so minute wait. Would need a fork and a knife to cut into it because the toppings weigh down the bread a bit. Crust/appetizers/bread is very very good with the hot garlic sauce provided. If I could buy it I would! If you're not a fan of hot it might come off as really spicy. But the flavour is strong and works well with the breads for sure! Bread is fresh, with a perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Price- fairly priced! About $12-25 dishes. Nothing heavy on the pocket. 

Service & environment- Amazing. Waitress kept checking up on us, let us sit near the tv to watch the Jays game. Made sure our water jug was never empty. Accommodated us really well! Environment was a quiet ambience with dim lights (on a Sunday night). Family friendly. 

Overall- HIGHLY recommend this place!! Definitely coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"I had the DIAVOLA pizza and it was pretty good.  Not like I was back in Italy but still tasty.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Water, bread and olives were brought quickly.  Watch out for the red condiment they bring along with the bead; it is fiery hot.  I would have preferred a little balsamic and olive oil to dip the lovely bread in.

I had a glass of the house red (Montepulciano D'Abruzzo, Ortona) and it was very nice (is not a little too warm for my taste).

All in all a good experience and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. The white pizzas are really good too. Nice cozy atmosphere. The bread they give to start is  tasty, fresh and warm. Good service. I've been wanting to go back asap."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely to die for!! Authentic pizza made in an amazing oven. Cool brick facade inside. Very fast and incredible service! The servers are very attentive and kind. The bread is delicious as is the hot garlic sauce. I highly recommend the salads as well. It is so hard to find good Italian pizza in the city--this place wows!"}
{"text":"Under appreciated neighbourhood gem. Amazing crusts. All pizzas are good. The free bread and hot sauce before is great. 

Calzone is my fav, but cants go wrong."}
