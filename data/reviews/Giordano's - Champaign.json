{"text":"Disappointed.  First visit was a few days after they opened in Champaign. Pizza was not good. Undercooked in some parts. We tried again, this time delivery. Pizza was better, but was delivered cold and almost an hour after the delivery confirmation time (2.5+ hrs total). Garlic bread was hard- not edible. Giordano's is still my favorite pizza, but not in Champaign."}
{"text":"The ordering & pick up process was very friendly. The wait time was 45-1h(a good thing). Now for the food. I was alil disappointed by the sampler especially for the price($11.95). The potato bites were over done, small, & you only get four. And just an FYI, don't put COLD dressing in the box then in the WARMER(NOT A GOOD TASTE). As for the pizza, it was good but needed more sauce. It was the first day so they can't go anywhere but up
DEFINITELY going back because HEY ITS GIORDANO'S. And once they get the hang of it all, Papa Del's watch out."}
{"text":"Placed an order online and waited 45+ min to pick  up, got home (Monticello) and realized the pizza was undercooked- RAW, which is crazy given the time allowed to prepare. That was just the THIN crust, our individual deep dish was completely wrong- olives and mushrooms (yuck) is not even close to sausage, green pepper and onion! We have been to several Giordano's locations and the Champaign location is terrible and doesn't even compare! The food was highly disappointing and there always seems to be some kind of chaos occurring when I've been in to pick up. This was me giving them one last chance, doubt I'll ever return to this location!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Giordano's tonight {Saturday the 19 of August. We ordered a Chicago deep dish pizza,salad and drinks. The pizza was the worst I have ever had. It was tasteless,too cheesy and the crust was awful. Needless to say,We did not take the remaining slices with us. I was expecting something spectacular but was so disappointed.
Back to Papa Del's forever!"}
{"text":"I've ordered food from this location twice -- this is a review of the service, not the food. The food is very much what you'd expect from Giordano's, consistent with what I've had in Chicago. 

The service is terrible. The first order I made for pick-up, and even though I was there at my pick-up time, my food wasn't ready so what was supposed to be a quick pop-in to grab my food and go home turned into an extended wait. This time I ordered for delivery -- I had an estimated delivery time of 7:05-7:20pm. At 7:40, I called to ask about the delay and was told they didn't have enough drivers so called another in and my order was now out for delivery. I was estimated it could take up to 15 minutes from then. My food didn't arrive until 8:16pm, and as one would expect with that kind of delay, the food was just slightly above room temperature. 

This is not a common or inexpensive order, so to have such unreliable service and to have the end product compromised when not delivered hot has guaranteed that I won't order food from this location again."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. So how does a pizza place run out of pepperoni and pepsi right after opening???? Pizza is mediocre at best. Won\"t be back. Orded the hand stretched crust. Tasted alot like a frozen tombstone pizza crust.  Staff seemed very awkward, kind of made you feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Leaving another review for the folks who still have yet to make it in to Giordannos here in Champaign. We requested Gregory R. this time due to his outstanding service last time. He provided excellent service yet again! One of the managers, Travis,  came over this time and introduced himself and was very helpful and prompt about checking on our food along with Gregory. 

We felt very honored that our review not only helped out a business that we love but it got enough attention that people have gone in and asked specifically for Gregory. Awesome experience, amazing customer service and great food!! 

(Order the bruschetta as an appetizer!!!)"}
{"text":"I had the spaghetti and house salad, and they made the visit worthwhile. The garlic bread was also delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped into Giordano's for the first time today since it opened in this area.  They had a really nice lunch special and was reasonably priced.  I really like deep dish pizza and this didn't disappoint.  Good food."}
{"text":"I would't recommend this place because every time I try to order a thin crust and they brought out a Chicago style pizza. I won't be returning here anymore poor service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience from this location.  From the girl in the phone who made me wait for 15 minutes and hanging up on me, to the kitchen forgetting to make our pizza. Negative 5 stars."}
{"text":"Initially excited to have a little taste of Chicago in Champaign. I was eager to try it. I had one immediate concern, the location, attached to the mall. A spot that doomed its predecessor restaurant. It was nice that you didn't have to enter the mall to. The second concern was being notified when we arrived that they were having issues with the pizza oven. Not a good omen for being a new restaurant, and that still remains to be seen. But the more than made up for it with good food and great service. We order a deep dish meat pizza and it was fabulous. I ordered a Greek salad that came with no olives, perhaps an oversight. But all in all a good experience. I will come back."}
{"text":"I have ordered here a few times as a native Chicagoan. As always, the pizza is wonderful and served perfectly! 

I've leaving this review more for the service than anything. The pizza was delivered NOT on time but a bit early. It's a Friday night at 6:00 so naturally they are slammed with orders. Mistakes happen and it happened tonight. The deep dish was fine but thin crust had wrong toppings. It occurs sometimes. I called back to discuss the issue knowing that now it was likely even busier and Matt helped fix the problem and started a rush order. 

Restaurants make mistakes sometimes. It's just a fact when you serve hundreds or thousands of people. It's how you fix it that matters. Matt was helpful and friendly and never showed an ounce of frustration.

Well done Giordano's. Don't worry about a mistake. 

You didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicago Classic Deep-dish for a pick-up from this location on 01/27/18. When I arrived, there was no one at the pick-up area. A guy was standing in the what seemed to be kitchen drinking his beverage. After 5 minutes, he came out, and apparently my food was already sitting out.
Then, I come home and open the pizza. There was no pepperoni in the pizza. Chicago Classic has pepperoni as its topping on their menu, but not on mine. Check on this location's fucking staff."}
{"text":"It's just okay, not great, just okay. Will I eat here again? Most likely not. Go to a Giordano's in Chicago and compare. Our pizza seriously was lacking in flavor. Do Note it does take about 45min for a deep dish to come to your table. Which is the normal. Server was alright she was friendly. only came to our table twice the whole hour and half we were there. I might give it another shot in the future when we are craving deep dish. May end up with a great experience."}
{"text":"We decided to beat the crowd and have an early dinner at 3pm.   The place was only 1/3 full yet we waited 45 minutes (no hostess in sight and a waitress had to get our names on the list) while we watched staff screw around but not getting tables ready.  Their idea of prepping a table is using a dry wash cloth and just make a few errant passes across the table (I enjoyed the pieces of leftover crust from the previous folks; nearly thought Santa may have come before us).   Considering flu is running rampant, maybe a little disinfect on the ol table would have been nice.  Seeing how long this was taking, we figured we would pre-order our pizza so that once we got seated we could eat and hit the road as we were passing through on a long road trip.  We are Chicagoans and used to how Giardanos are run up north. Tight ship, professional and while they have fun, take their jobs seriously.  Yes you wait but that's expected with big crowds.  We still waited another 60 minutes at our table for our pre-ordered pizza despite having placed our order 45 minutes prior to that when waiting to be seated.  We figured waiting over 90 minutes during non prime time would result in the most awesome pizza on earth...I say that in jest.   When we finally got our order (a medium stuffed pizza) they managed to screw that up too.  We ordered drinks that only took 20 minutes to get.   I know, its a bit in middle of earth IL and I'm guessing things just run a little slower....but really?  20 minutes for ice water?  After eating we had to request our bill several times as this experience was getting ridiculous.  We truly wanted to pay and just get out of there but had to wait 15 more minutes despite mentioning we were now in a hurry as we looked forward to our 6 hour drive.  Seeing how poorly run this place was, not to mention the staff bad talking their own place of work (management, better training and supervision needed), I paid cash as I feared our credit card info would be stolen (oh, tell your staff when they carry someone's credit card to not leave out in plain sight while talking to your BF).  We kept a sense of humor about this and had a few good laughs with the folks seated next to us who were going through the same thing.   It was probably the one thing we enjoyed most; enjoying one another's misery.   There seemed to be plenty of staff but the managers need to run a tighter ship.  There was one real nice waitress at the table next to us that should be the manager; she knew customer service and had we been rating her, she would get 5 stars (blond, 40-50's).   And to top off a magical experience, I got the the runs shortly after eating this meal.  Charmin thanks you.  I don't."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!  I absolutely love Giordanos in Chicago and this place is a great place to get a bite to eat after shopping all day! If you don't mind the wait, of course. It is 45 minutes for a deep dish, but so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness my wife and I were hoping to have a good dinner at the Giordano's restaurant that just opened. It only opened last week, so I was a little concerned about the service and new staff issues. 
We were seated promptly, surprise #1 . Gregory the server was on top of everything to make sure everyone of our needs were being met, surprise 2. Excellent job, Gregory thank you for a great experience. He served our salad and pizza in a very timely way with all my special requests, surprise 3. Then Brian, another teammate came to our table to clear the plates we were done using and make sure there was room for the pizza, surprise 4. 
This was an excellent experience. I almost didn't want to share so we could keep Giordano's in Champaign to ourselves, but I had to share.

This was not just good it was great!"}
{"text":"I've been a Giordano's fan for a long time, so I was super excited we have one now one in Champaign. Pizza and cheesy bread were both amazing! Service was fantastic as well! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So...... I had Giordano's in Rockford last year on my way from TN to MN. It was incredible!!!! This time we stopped at this location. We ordered the same pizza. Just a large deep dish pepperoni. And it was good. Don't get me wrong. Still 3 stars. But it didn't have the same flavor as the one in Rockford. This one was pretty bland. It looked exactly the same... I can't pinpoint it. I'm not sure if your stores recipient vary. But it was noticeably different to both my husband and myself. 

Our server was very kind and attentive. 

Restaurant was clean and cozy. Bathrooms were clean. 

Price was fine. It's a very filling pizza. It was just disappointing that the flavor was so different."}
{"text":"Just like Chicago! Went here yesterday (4/12) it was great. Had an individual pizza with Parmesan fries and it was really good. An individual pizza looks small but is quite enough. All the cheesy goodness of a normal pizza! Highly recommend for a closer to home deep dish. It's good to not have to go all the way to Chicago."}
{"text":"I came here just as it opened today as I was out at the mall shopping by myself and have always wanted to try this place. The waitress was super sweet and attentive. I had the spaghetti and meatballs with a Caesar salad--the meat sauce has to be one of the best I've ever had! The individual size was a huge portion, plenty of leftovers. I will definitely come back because there's so much more to try! Don't let the negative reviews deter you from going!"}
{"text":"Giordiano's is by far my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza place and the fact that it opened in Champaign made me super happy for my taste buds but not so much for my stomach which will have to frequently endure me overeating. Cause their stuffed deep dish pizza is just that good!! 
This place opened just this week so I went in expecting not the greatest service but to my surprise the service was superb! We were constantly attended to and everyone from the host to the server were polite and friendly. Will definitely be going back often."}
{"text":"The service is as bad as the pizza is as good... some of the best pizza, some of the worst service. We've done pickup and dine-in five times since they opened, and the experience is pretty consistent. We forgave the first few visits as probably just the staff getting used to things, but it's still just as chaotic. Talking about staff standing around clearly not doing anything and not trying to help each other, the manager running around all over the place trying to do too much, wrong drinks and food brought to the table or given at carry out ... over and over. Now we play paper, rock, scissors for who is going to go in and deal with the mess to pickup our order."}
{"text":"We'd heard so many good things about Giordano's from Chicago transplants to Champaign, we were eager to try it. We arrived an hour and ten minutes before a hair appointment in the mall to be sure we'd have time to eat. Unfortunately, we were told that not only the deep dish but also the thin crust pizza took a minimum of one hour. We opted for pasta instead. 

We both ordered pasta with meat sauce and meatballs. I asked the waitress whether we had accidentally been served marinara. The meat sauce had no visible signs of meat and no taste of meat. The tomato sauce was broken up like marinara, rather than smooth like traditional, slow-cooked red gravy. The sauce had a sour note with very little acid -- not at all balanced. My homemade sauce is so much better. Disappointing enough that I didn't bring the leftovers home.

The meatballs, which came three of good size to an order, had a good texture, but they were bland and worst of all were cold in the center (not room temp -- cold). 

The small piece of garlic bread that came with the pasta was awful. It did not taste of garlic, let alone fresh garlic. It was crispy with some kind of hardened garlic product on top (like freeze-dried garlic that had lost its flavor). I gave the bread on its own a 2 out of 10. My companion was more generous and gave it a 3 out of 10.

The only good part of the meal, aside from the diet Pepsi, was the pasta itself, which was not overcooked. I might be back to try to the pizza (I know, I know -- that's what they're famous for!), but I have my doubts.

The place was clean, but also noisy. Service was irregular and chaotic. By this I mean it took us more time than usual to get noticed and seated. The waitress did not know what al dente meant. She didn't know whether noodle substitutions were allowed. The waitress forgot to bring the salad I'd ordered (she actually forgot to turn it in for the order -- you can turn pasta, which is around $8 per order, into a meal with a $2 upcharge for a small salad; meatballs are a $3 upcharge). She disappeared midway through our meal and did not return with the check. I finally went to stand by the greeter's podium to let someone know we were ready to pay and paid from there. Some of the table bussers wandered between the tables throughout our dining experience watching television and didn't seem to have a clear sense of purpose."}
{"text":"Was waiting for them to open downstate. I wasn't disappointed. It was just as good as I remembered it if not even better. They have the best Chicago-style deep-dish that I've ever tasted. If you want the experience plan on being there for a little while. It takes a minimum of 50 minutes just to cook that pizza so plan on sitting back and relaxing but you won't will not regret it."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago with an affinity for deep dish, I was actually pleasantly surprised by this Giordano's after it opened up. The service was clearly not yet polished, which you may expect from this type of restaurant. It may take a while for that area to be reconciled. But the food was surprisingly on par with some of the deep dish locations downtown, which was unexpected. If you're unfamiliar with deep dish, you should come in expecting to wait at least 45 minutes for the pizza to be prepared - this is standard."}
{"text":"Fantastic deep dish in Champaign! There was quite a long wait to be seated, but the delicious pizza made it worth the wait. It is not the largest of restaurants, so it is nice that they have take-out and ready-to-cook frozen pizzas!"}
{"text":"I've been to Giordano's in Chicago. I've been to Giordano's in Indianapolis. I've been to the restaurant that has the Giordano's name in Champagne, but Giordano's it is NOT! 

The server was clearly frazzled from being the only one there. When she left halfway through the meal we got the bartender as a server whose attention was split into two different places. The bruschetta was all tomatoes, no balsamic or basil, and on soggy toast. The cheesy garlic bread was all parmesan? and no mozzarella? or provolone. The pizza was not served \"burn your tace off\" hot. 

And the server did not serve us the first slice per protocol; blasphemy! 

I'd rather finance a three hour trip to Chicago for the real thing than drive an hour to the next town for this."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be top of the line pizza.  Stuffed pizza with all of the extras.  I ordered the Chicago Style and it barely had any pepperoni on it.  One slice had zero pieces of pepperoni.  The pizza was served warm not hot.  

The manager came over and gave me a 10% discount and acted like he did me a big favor.  

Obviously, I was not concerned about price or I would not be eating at the most expensive pizza place.  I wanted premium pizza and this was average pizza at best."}
{"text":"Well, I can only assume we got lucky when eating here. It was a ghost town. Maybe it was because it's summer and school is out? Maybe? The entire mall was mostly empty. Then again, there had just been a shooting there the night before. 

It was quiet for us--only two other tables eating when we arrived. Food took a while, but that is to be expected. They did let us know that we can order ahead. I will certainly use that method in the future. 

Service was fine, and the food came out as-ordered. No real complaints here. It's not a contender for the best pizza I've ever had, but it's very good."}
{"text":"I have to eat gluten free. That's a major bummer since pizza is one of my favorite foods. Let's be honest some of the gluten free pizzas taste like cardboard. So until I tried Giordano's gluten free pizza I was left living a life without pizza. Thank you, Giordano's! Their gluten free pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"Walked in, no host...sat myself at the bar, no bartender...waited 5 minutes still with nobody. All the while I know there is staff somewhere as I see a guy at the bar with a mostly full beer and a few tables in the dining room. I got up from the bar (still without service) and saw that there was still no host so I left. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"First time eating at Giordano's last night. One thing that stood out was that when our pizza came out (we ordered deep dish) it wasn't even hot. The waitress was nice enough to take the pizza back and have the cooks heat it up again. She did take our drinks off the bill, which was nice. She was a nice waitress. Over all, I think my husband and I would give Giordano's another try."}
{"text":"I've had Giordano's many times in Chicago, and more recently we've ordered their deep dish pizzas through the mail. They are always so, so good! We just went there today to eat, and it was pretty disappointing. The server was really good on drinks, but when she brought our pizza out, it was thin crust. We had ordered deep dish. The thin crust tasted about like a Casey's pizza. I do like Casey's, but the point is that Giordano's shouldn't taste like gas station pizza. And it still cost us $30. Poor service and low quality pizza. Apparently this isn't the Giordano's experience you get in Chicago."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar to avoid waiting for a table. That was a big mistake. If the bartender was the intended server, she was totally inattentive to the customers. Two tables had there pizzas given to someone else (one of which was us) and other customers had to ask some random waiter walking by if they could get drink refills. They also had to ask to pay their bill and get their pizza boxed up.  The bar wasn't even busy. The pizza is very good and they did comp our dinner due to the issue with our pizza being given to someone else but they need to seriously look at the service they provide. We have ate in the dining room once before without incident so maybe it's just the bar area but they need help!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and we ordered pizza with no onions. After almost two hours we finally received our pizza with onions. Waitress said she would talk to the manager and a lady came up to our table at one point and asked how we were doing. We had no idea she was even a manager. Very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"My family has been here three times since they opened. My wife and I visited a Chicago location way back in 2000 and loved it. We were thrilled to find a location opened in CU. We have had excellent pizza on every trip, dependable and prompt service, and a great experience each time. Our kiddos aren't attuned to waiting for deep dish so we always get thin crust, and we love it. I've had pizza all over bee the country, and in Mexico, Canada, France, England, Ireland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Poland and I think Giordano's is my favorite of them all. A++++++++"}
{"text":"I was at this location on April 2, 2018 at 11:30am and a man pulled next to me and started yelling at me in the parking lot for parking in the expectant mother parking spot.  I'm 9 weeks pregnant with a high risk pregnancy.  I had some choice words for him, went inside and proceeded to pick up my pizza for my family.  The nice servers could not get into the system bc the manager left without logging them into the serving station.  I paid cash and left.  A nice server walked me out to the car to ensure my son and my safety.  The man (the manager) was still there, got out of his car and started yelling at me.  The server turned around and walked inside.  The man went inside.  I then walked back into Giordano's to tell the servers to call security, that is when they informed me that he was their manager!!!!!  Unbelievable!!!  If you are having a bad day, it gives you zero right to yell at women and children for minding their own business.  You have no idea what is going on with my body sir, so please move on to your place of business and try to do your job without stalking and yelling at people in the parking lot. The servers are great, the food is decent, but you sir, need to go.  Zero professionalism even after he saw I was a patron of his establishment.  The GM or the upper management in Giordano's need to take the trash out before it drags this location out of business.  Made a complaint with the Mall security and unfortunately my family and friends will not return to this location until he is gone.  Jim Lasaris is him name.  Terrible.

The owners contact me and apologized. Very professional and kind.  Apparently this was out of character for this manager to behave this way.  Just happy that this won't happen to another pregnant woman taking advantage of the parking spot meant to make our lives easier.  The personal attention that this post has gotten from upper management is appreciated."}
{"text":"Just see the pictures I posted! Y'all coulda killed me + you left out my sons applesauce & kids drink. Wow. ?Damn near died!"}
{"text":"Went to eat deep dish pizza at Giordanos visiting from New Jersey and was disappointed when I got there at 819 pm and  was told they stopped serving deep dish at 815 pm. I told the waiter we travelled from New Jersey and missed cut off by 4 minutes ,mind you they close at 9 pm. The waiter said he would talk to manager Alexandra and let us know.  The waiter came back  saying there was nothing he could do and that deep dish was not an option. We left and want to Old Chicago pizza just a minute away where the food and ambiance was very nice."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for dinner at 5 PM on January 31 ordered two medium pizzas thin style and while the pizza itself was very good I didn't care for the fact that there was a lot of extra crust around the edge of the pizza that really has no flavor and it was just dry in cracker like,I felt as though I threw away at least a third of my pizza due to not being able to enjoy the crust as in most every pizza restaurant that I have tried the crust is generally soft and enjoyable . It would be much more enjoyable if the ingredients on the pizza the sauce and the cheese were pulled all the way out to the edge of the pizza to correct this problem someday after they have been open for a while I will maybe try going back and checking it out after all there's nothing better than a great pizza one that's what you have a craving for. Not sure it was worth the $50.00 I spent after throwing away $12.00 worth of my food.
It was very nice that members of I would assume upper management were at the door to greet us as we leave and ask questions about how we enjoyed our meal and if there were any improvements that could be made and I did in fact bring this up to them and they did take note of it so maybe that will be something that will improve in the future it's not often that you have management at the door asking their patrons how their meal was generally you get no reaction whatsoever and nobody really seems to care if you had a good meal or not

Was contacted by management and advised that there corporate office would contact me, as of yet nothing so I have to assume that they don't care, I spent $50.00 that night and threw away at least $12.00 worth of food.
The best Pizza  place in town is and will always be Papa Del's, they have pleasing the people of the city for 40+ years and will continue to be my #1 place because they know how to make it right each time and you don't throw away any crust on the thin and the toppings are very generous and not sparse like Giordano's."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza was fresh and cooked perfectly, I will most definitely be here again 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow, was not even busy. Forgot my salad and when finally got it after I ate my entree it was served in a small bowl couldn't eat out of it without it flying out into the table. Pizza was so burnt & hard! First time here & our last sorry!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time!! Exited cause it had been about 10 years since a visit to Orlando Park. Ordered a thin crust as we were kind of in a hurry, not wanting to wait on the deep dish. I first noticed our server didn't write the order down and then had to return to verify the drink order,,, there were only 2 of us, yes ice tea and Pepsi thank you another visit 5 did you say medium?? Um no it was a small but medium is fine. 50 minutes later out comes a deep dish. Then she's asks did you want a thin crust?? Yes that's what we ordered, Stephanie isn't a fan of deep dish in the slightest!! Server offered to make a thin and it would be out in 15 minutes, well that's what we were hoping for 35 minutes ago!! Server was nice, she returned I asked for the check to pay for the drinks, the manager came over an apologized and said the drinks were on the house and also sent the pizza home with us. I understand mistakes but I felt there was too much time for no communication the responses to error were also delayed which basically ruined our nice day to Champaign. The bad mood was set, and it's difficult to pull her out of it!!! I do recall the manager saying I hope you give us another chance, I would but Stephanie won't there are far to many other options to potentially have this mistake happen again? I think she would have came back if only she tried the thin crust that never made it to the table.


Ana, thank you for your reply. Unfortunately the first impression is always important !!! This has and will continue to taint the feel of your company, it may not be right, but when there are so many other places that do get the order correct, why is it important to give another chance to a place that couldn't perform the way it should have? Think of this you need to have a appendix removed you go to pre-op learn what's going to happen expect a certain result and how to recover afterwards. Ok you have the procedure to learn the didn't remove your appendix but a kidney, but you still need your appendix removed are you going to the same surgeon?? No it may have not been his fault ? What why perhaps his support staff told him wrong or scheduling made a error many things can happen in every business and environment but sometimes a repeat customer will not return. I'm sorry but this visit ruined your experience for us severely, what I'm dealing with is a very finicky picky eating spouse and it truly did affect the rest of the day we were cranky for not eating and yet had to wait another 4!hours to get food. I do appreciate your response although it won't change things. Even if you were to send a gift card ( don't ) we wouldn't use it. We will just go where they get things correct, I'm truly sorry this happened for both of us!!!!

{"text":"There was a lot of hype when this place opened up, being one of the only deep dish chain/restaurants available here in Champaign. My friends and I ordered their lunch specials, which were definitely affordable ($7.75 before tax). I got the 6inch sausage deep dish with garlic parmesan fries. The fries were simple, yet good, having a nice crisp and seasoning to them. The pizza was subpar. At first glance, it looked imbalanced (little sausage, and not really round). The pizza itself was okay, a decent amount of cheese (more would have definitely been welcomed), but the pie crust was just..bland. There was little flavor to it, and a bit too much for such a small pizza. The pizza came out relatively quick, but it did not give a sense of \"right out of the oven\", like what you would find in Chicago."}
{"text":"Ordered our stuffed pizza to go but decided it smelled too good and we opted to eat it at the restaurant.  They were very accommodating and the pizza was delicious.  As good, if not better, than the Giordannos we have had in Chicago and Joliet!  

Not sure about other reviewers complaining about how long it takes to bake, it is stuffed pizza it takes a while but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends a week after they opened on a Friday. It felt like they were severely understaffed, and many of the employees kept telling us they're just figuring out the flow and pace of things. We got there around 6:30, seated at 7:30, ordered drinks at 8:00 and our food arrived 40-45 minutes later. Our two appetizers (Samplers) got us through the wait, finishing our meal around 9:30.

I've had Giordano's in Chicago and for me, pizza doesn't differ too much from place to place. The pizza crust was thick and each slice had a LOT of cheese. I enjoyed the vegetarian pizza immensely, with layers of spinach in between the crust. The Meat Lover is not for the faint hearted with sausages crammed in the bottom crust, topped by more cheese and meat. The clear glass panel that lets you see into the kitchen is entertaining."}
