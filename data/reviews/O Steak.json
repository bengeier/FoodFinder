{"text":"Le meilleur des steakhouse que j'ai jamais mangé. Le service est très chaleureux, la place est magnifique et tout est nouveau. J'aurais jamais pensé un jour manger un si bon steak, bien cuit et avec un parfait assaisonnement. Je vous conseil un bon dessert avant de partir. Le prix en vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Si vous recherchez un steak halal, dans une belle atmosphère, Ô steak est la place idéale. Aussi, personnellement j'adore leur entrée de calmars!"}
{"text":"I am writing my review after trying this restaurant twice. The first time I went, the restaurant had only been open for a month. The service is excellent and the decor and atmosphere is really nice but they obviously had some kinks to work out. The food took very long to come out. The Bavette steak was good, the short ribs were delicious however there was so much fat on the ribs that when it came down to actual meat, half of the ribs were pure fat. The sides were unimpressive except for the vegetables which were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The Creme brûlée was way too thick in consistency and the sugar too burnt :( The Nutella pie was scrumptious!   The 2nd time I went, the service was still spot on. I had the O Steak burger this time which was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! The only problem was the ciabatta as a bun, it was thick and a little hard to eat but still delish. The fries were perfectly done as well. For some odd reason we got the appetizer (Spinach dip) after the main meal and it was good however served with tortilla chips that were obviously out of a bag which was disappointing but the dip itself was good, just not your traditional spinach dip, it is thicker and creamier. Food still took over half an hour to come out and without getting the appetizers before the main meal, there really wasn't a way to distract from that. All in all, I would still go back to try something else but really hope they are able to improve on food delivery time otherwise not sure I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a double date while touring Montreal and we were looking for a classy place that was halal.   We were not disappointed!  The men each ordered the 14 Oz steak and the women ordered the filet minion. Needless to say the boys were jealous of our meals even though they had really great dishes.   My filet minion was moist, juicy and cooked exactly as I like it.   If I could rate higher than 5 stars I would have!  A bonus for us is that they have a small prayer area upstairs, which was great as we were travelling through.  I know that if we find ourselves in Montreal again we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for a connecting flight elsewhere , and was really glad to find a halal steak place in the city. The inside decor and atmosphere was great and the servers were extremely friendly. They were also very accommodating as I substituted an item for another potato side.  The steak was delicious and the side orders were delicious too, out of many of the halal steak restaurants I've been to in toronto I'd say this one trumps them all. I really need to make a trip again to Montreal to give this another try. The steak was cooked to perfection and was really easy to cut and not rubbery whatsoever."}
{"text":"Le décor est très beau et le service est correct. Nous y avons été durant le mois de Ramadan et il y avait un menu en conséquence avec soupe, salade,plat et dessert. C'était généralement bon! La cuisson des viandes était excellente. Le contre-filet était gras et fibreux et la sauce au canneberge ne se mariait pas au poulet (voir photos). Prévoir un budget d'environ 30$ par personne."}
{"text":"Great halal steak house! I had the salmon and my hubby had the ribs. It's comparable to Affy's in Toronto, but not as many options, and the portions at O Steak are larger. The service was okay, and the ambience was beautiful."}
{"text":"The waiter was kind. But the food took wayyyy too long. The steaks were decent, not great. Food was cold. I came here because I had some friends that wanted halal meat. I would certainly not come back, I like my steak in a traditional steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have very high expectations when it comes to steak and surprisingly, this place met all my expectations!! Amazing interior, quite chic and rustic.. Amazing service and delicious food! We were there for ages as we had to travel quite a bit to get there but definitely worth it!! Cant wait to visit again !"}
{"text":"I was there for a friend's birthday, and I wasn't very hungry, so I really don't recall delivery times. BUt I did order two appetizers, thinking I would nibble a bit. Surprise! they were much bigger portions than I expected. The fried calmar and the salmon tartar were both very tasty and portions were great. The salmon tartar even came with a salad! I ended up eating more than I expected. I would go back to try the steak though, a lot of others in the group had steak and were ranting about it. All things considered, for the price, I was very happy and would go back given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Been there many times and continue to go. They have a couple of mocktails. Their virgin mojito us excellent. Have tried their Pina colada but it was too sweet for my liking. They have great soup options. I've had their ribs and steak. Both well cooked and seasoned but I prefer the ribs. They give a small portion of potato wedges but fairly large sized. Their house wedges are tender and spiced. Bonus lots of free parking in the back side."}
{"text":"This is the only place where you can have a satisfying halal steak! The service is good and the you have many choices in the menu, including delicious calamris as an appetizer.   I recommande this to anyone, the quality of the food is just great  Good job guys keep it up"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant when it first opened and the food was great, however based on my visit tonight we ordered the filet mignon and we were served a very fibrous steak that is far from being a filet mignon. We mentioned this to our waiter who spoke to the owner. The owner did not come to talk to us and sent another waiter tried to convince us that it was filet mignon. This is unacceptable  in a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"I'm a little late on this but here goes. My first time having steak in Canada and it was good. The confusion came when i asked for a baked potato and was given red rose potatoes instead. They were really good and my friends Atlantic Salmon deserved to have the chimichurri sauce that was put on my plate. The cook and seasoning on my steak was good so it didn't need any steak sauce.   They did take a while with our food making me think they were fishing for the salmon. LOL."}
