{"text":"De loin le meilleur resto dans le village. Nourriture excellente, prix raisonnable même pour le vin. Excellent service, sympathique et belle terrasse aussi. 
By far the best restaurant in the village. Amazing food and good prices, even for the wine."}
{"text":"Kudos for this restaurant being VERY close to a metro on a rainy day, not to mention that this was a perfect opportunity for me to explore what Burmese food consisted of; and I was definitely pleased. The host was very warm and the atmosphere was pretty pleasant. I appreciated that they indicated in their menu precisely the ingredients in every one of their plates & also marked if whether or not they contained nuts, spices ( medium or very spicy) and if some were vegetarian.  Even during a late busy afternoon, the staff would still ask us if everything was okay and would chat comfortably with us despite the fact that they may have had a pretty long day. The food was worth the price as it was unique in its own genre. I'm glad to say that Dagon wasn't this \"Typical Asian\" restaurant were they westernized their plates and its names: they did their best to preserve its authenticity. I, for one, am a teenage student and would recommend this place to anyone regardless their age."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend - not a very busy evening and we had to wait over an hour to get our food, which when it did arrive was lukewarm. Won't be heading back there again."}
{"text":"I checked out this new village restaurant for lunch today. I'd never had Burmese before, and was curious. The space is done up very nicely; it's simple, but a clean and appealing environment. The service is very friendly. They have a great and reasonably priced lunch menu, that includes a starter, rice and a homemade drink along with your main. Everything was excellent. The food tasted homemade and the meat was perfectly cooked and tender. They are putting care into their food and into their restaurant, and it really shows! I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! How have I lived this long without knowing how wonderful Burmese food can be?!

I enjoyed a fabulous meal tonight, from appetizers through to dessert. It was obvious from the first bite great attention had been paid to the details. Each dish was full of fascinating flavours. And I particularly loved all of the elaborate textures. The meal was a feast for the senses!  While the restaurant serves a variety of meat dishes, it is also incredibly friendly to vegans and vegetarians, which I greatly appreciated. 

The vibe of the restaurant was relaxed and lovely. The staff was attentive and gracious as so many others have said.

Dagon is a great addition not only to the restaurant scene in The Village, but for Montreal as a whole."}
{"text":"The food was hit or miss but the service was terrible.  The kitchen was unable to get things out in a reasonable time frame.  Appetizers took 30+ minutes.  After 1 hour we received the rice that comes with our meal.  It took almost 1.5 hours to get a main dish for 4 people.  Several parties just got up and left.  The shrimp and pumpkin was awful--overcooked, rubbery shrimp. The only thing that seemed decent on our table were the ribs.  Additionally we paid about $25/person so it really was not worth it."}
{"text":"We decided to try the new Dagon (not dragon) Restaurant in Montreal, and had a lovely and memorable dinner.   Tala (one of the owners) greeted us warmly and made us feel very welcome.  All of the waiters were friendly, knew the dishes and were quietly attentive.  (Did I mention good-looking?) The restaurant was attractive, calming, and decorated simply but effectively.  The restaurant had just got its' BYOB license, so we were able to bring our own wine.  We enjoyed sharing the appetizer, main course dishes and dessert.
We hadn't eaten Burmese food before, and found everything tender, nicely spiced and delicious.  Overall it had excellent service, very tasty and interesting food, and turned into an evening to remember.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great surprise!

Honestly I don't take the time to write a lot of reviews but when I do it's because I think it really deserves it and is exceptional! Try it, the Birman food they serve is very good, it is a little bit similar to Indian but more fine. For the place and the quality of the food I say it's pretty cheap. Try it you wont regret I promise!"}
{"text":"Tastes good.. But extremely slow service 
Veg samosa are good for appetizer . Chicken curry with rice is good . Fish curry with tomato sauce tastes regular like a home made dish ."}
{"text":"So you think that in a city of 8.2 million people there is at least a way to keep a single Burmese restaurant alive - but alas, over the past 3 years we have seen 3 Burmese places drop dead in New York City - one in the village (Village Mingala), one in Queens and the final one happened on the Upper East Side.  Looks like the second avenue subway construction finally put the nail in the coffin for my beloved Mangala, and with that, Burmese restaurants become extinct in the Big Apple.  Where am I going to get my la phet and mohinga fix?!

Montreal has a population of 1.7 million (just like Philadelphia), and even though the restaurant scene is famously over-saturated and places constantly die, they manage to kill off only one burmese joint (Ruby Burma on the Main, RIP).  Well, that leaves us with one - Dagon.  

In terms of location, it's near Metro Papineau on the green line.  Get off the station, ponder the irony of the mural of a Catholic priest in a gay friendly area, and then look around.   You should be on St Catherine Street East and the Metro super-marche/Cartier bridge will be in front of you.  Turn around and walk 3 blocks until you get to Champlain street (it's on the corner).  Alternatively the 15/St Catherine bus stops at the end of the block.  

Now, as for decor and service - Check out the light fixtures with the Asian umbrella motif, the coat rack and the typical wooden tables and chairs.  Comfy, but not homey.  During the evening we visited there was only one waiter manning the entire operation, and I am guessing there is only another person in the back doing the kitchen work, rather typical of smaller Montreal restaurants.  Sure, the service is slow, but then I would argue that Montrealites tend to dine slow anyways.  Bring a bottle of red, engage in a conversation, etc.  If it's a Saturday or a Sunday most shops will be closed past 5 or 6p anyways, so it's not like there is a massive rush to do something else.   Don't be an American dick and rush, rush, rush.  

Now, as for the food?  Well, the quality is more difficult to ascertain as I only had about 3 reference points - the Mingalas in New York and a Mohinga joint in Macau.  That being said, I wish that they are more detailed with the menu descriptions.  For example, chickpea fritters.  In Burma the locals create a tofu analog called tophu (the Burmese language do not have an f sound, so the best way to salute a policeman will be to tell him to phuck off), which is typically fried and cut into slices - in certain places it's also referred to as a chickpea fritter.  The item that I received was essentially like a pakora, except with chopped deep fried chickpeas.  Not quite the same.  As for the tea leaf salad (La Phet), it's missing some ingredients that I am accustomed to.  The Mohinga is pretty good, though.  Not quite the fresh fish version with Vermicelli that I am used to, but still very good.  You can taste the lemongrass (a bit light though) and coconut flavors in the curry flavors.  The Yangon beef is a short rib stew with the asian clove/masala kick, and the herbed rice is essentially a biryani - a spiced rice pilaf with fruits and nuts that goes well with the stew in question.  Portion is a little small for the price, but it's gay village.  Things are generally not that cheap here.  Overall, not a disappointment, but not a revelation either.  

So yeah, I would not joneze about it back in NYC, and I might not even stop by the next time I end up at YUL, but hey, it's good to know it exists."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight Sept 8. My spouse and I shared six items: Baya Kyaw, Lat Phet Tok, Pumpkin Curry aux Crevettes, Coconut Rice, and Banana Fritters with vanilla ice cream. All these dishes were exceptionally good except the Baya Kyaw, which we both thought was okay but not outstanding.
This restaurant was a lucky choice for us two visitors from San Francisco. Be sure to try the pumpkin curry with shrimp, and the La Phet Tom (fermented tea leaves, small peas, lettuce, grilled ground nuts, and sesame)."}
{"text":"This was a highlight of my time in Montreal. The service was impeccable, the wines available were great and the food was unparalleled. I'd never had Burmese food before, but I will be searching NYC for a similar authenticity. Worth every penny and more."}
{"text":"Second time in Montreal and i finally made it to Dagon. Service wasnt as bad as everyone else claimed it to be. We sat outside and had pretty decent service. My pumpkin soup was more like a stew, but was delicious. the rice was cooked well, but honestly had barely any coconut flavor. The meal over all was good, but nothing to wow me."}
{"text":"My wife and I were enjoying a beautiful Sunday afternoon walking down St Catherine and we came across Dagon. We were supper psyched to have stumbled across a Burmese resto. They weren't open yet but we made a point to come back later in the afternoon. 

When we arrived the terrace had just filled up and we got the first table inside. We ordered some food and then we waited. After about 30 min our appetizer arrived. After another 30 minutes our food had still not arrived, which wasn't ideal but we were having a good time and noticed that a few spots had opened up on the terrace. So, I asked our server if we could move outside to one of the available tables. She said that she would have to check with the manager and then didn't come back. So I asked the manager myself and was told that it would not be possible for us to move to the terrace as those spaces were only available on a \"first come first serve\" basis. I pointed out that we had been there for over an hour and still ad not received our order. Still it was not possible for us to move to an available table outside. 

WE really didn't think that this was an acceptable level of service, so we decided we woudl pay for our appetizer and leave.  Needless to say we won't be back ."}
{"text":"Restaurant dont la cuisine est délicieuse. Nous avons dû réserver au préalable et c'est fortement conseillé !
Des plats succulents, un service à la hauteur. La salle ne comprend pas tant de table que cela et la terrasse n'est pas ouverte si la température extérieure n'est pas suffisante. 

Un must de Montreal et du village !"}
{"text":"Wonderful!

Now I'm not saying folks should do this, but as it happened my friend rod and I entered this place at 9:45pm having mis-read the sign thinking they closed at 11pm. No, their closing time was 10!  But the host (so sad I didn't get his name!) - and I assume son of the owners, who I also assume are the chefs - greeted us warmly and with genuine welcome and respect for our presence.

When I asked whether they were closing, he explained that the kitchen closes at 10, but the front generally stays open if there are people.

From that point forward, service was genuinely warm, thoughtful and inviting. We ordered the tea-leaf salad, lentil soup, beef curry and vegetable curry.  All very delicious, boldly flavored and well-balanced.  The food is good and I will definitely recommend this place and come here again.

The ambiance was very clean, clearly mindfully tended and a testament to the attentiveness of the owners.

Overall, the experience of dining at The Dragon was rich and a beautiful way to spend American Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, lunch, dinner, with company and alone, the food doesn't disappoint. 

Vegan perspective: They actually know what vegan is and they always have a few great dishes to offer.

Service: Can be a little slow, and I've twice had parties arriving after me served first (no comment on motivation). Discounting one star for that."}
{"text":"We tried Dagon because we have never had the chance to eat Burmese food. The service was impeccable! Our waiter explained the menu and what to expect (spices similar to Indian and Asian food, but combined a bit differently), and was helpful in suggesting what to order.  The restaurant itself was lovely--plenty of privacy while maintaining an open feel.  We enjoyed the meal, and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Cuisine fine, accueil parfait, réservation conseillée, l'un des meilleurs (sinon le meilleur) restos du Village."}
{"text":"If you like Indian, Thai, asian food - you need to give this place a chance as they provide you with a beautiful culinary experience. I am absolutely in love with this little restaurant in the gay village. The Swiss owner explained to me that he opened the restaurant with a family from Myanmar (Burma) whom he originally met at a refugee camp in Thailand. All the recipes are from this family and the authentic versions of what you would eat in this country. So here's about my 5 à 7 that became a \"6 à 11\"!

Now, let's talk about the food: \"Kaw Pyant\" this crunchy vegetarian spring roll was delicious, juicy and so flavourful. \"Ohn Noh Kaut Swae\" My friend really enjoyed this curry/coconut noodle soup. I tried the curry and it tasted just how curry should taste. What I liked from the menu is that you could make more than half of the plates vegan or vegetarian. It was very hard to choose something in the menu because everything looked fantastic, but I ended up trying the eggplant curry with the coconut rice \"Kayan Thee Nhat\". It was a tasty but simple dish with only the eggplant mixed with its spices - going forward, I would share this dish with another plate that has more greens (I'm vegan guys - need to see some greens! lol).  

Wines on the menu are selected by the owner, are not expensive and good! (Obvious win for me!)

The fried banana + ice cream was just the way you would want to end your experience.The semolina cake is for those of you who don't like sweet things. Coffee comes with a little cookie you can dip (make sure to dip it as it truly enhances the taste of the cookie - for coffee lovers only!).

As mentioned before, my friend and I stayed until 11 pm, when we asked the staff and realized the place closed at 10:30 pm, the staff offered to stay longer if we wanted - such a kind and generous gesture but we decided to leave and thanked them for being so welcoming - 5 on 5 for making your visitors feel comfortable! 

Bon appétit all!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Burmese restaurant.  Started out with the chickpea fritters which were a bit dry and bland.  Ordered the chicken curry with cocoanut rice and it was very good.  The tilapia curry was a bit fishy tasting.  Service was very friendly, the interior was very nice and prices aren't anything to complain about."}
{"text":"Honestly a great meal. First time trying Burmese food and I was very impressed. The staff was very friendly and made me want to come back! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything was succulent, flavorful, freshly prepared and the service was attentive and kind.  I loved my noodles and it was spiced perfectly.  I would eat there everyday if possible.  Dining outside and watching passersby was a highlight on a beautifully temperate evening."}
{"text":"What a find! Wow this was delicious. This is Montreal's only Myanmar restaurant. I had an eggplant dish over coconut rice. I asked for medium spicy and it was perfect. I would have like a little more rice though. I also tried the noodle dish (dry not in soup option) and it's better than a pad Thai.  Prices are very reasonable and a glass of wine starts at $5!  You can order a bottle of wine and the price is only $5 more than SAQ. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Burmese cuisine, therefore I cannot attest to the authenticity of their menu, but we really liked it! Meals are well served, giving you room to order entres without feeling to full to finish your main dish.
The service was a bit slow but very friendly! 
Would recommend it if you are in the village."}

However, the food was good. If you have plenty of time, then it will be great."}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants favoris de montréal. La nourriture typique est excellente, les prix sont abordables, le service très rapide et le vin que quelques dollars au dessus de la SAQ. On adore :)"}
{"text":"Food is good!!!
But we waited for more than an hour! Better don't be too hungry if you go here. It wasn't even very crowed... Maybe ask how long you'll have to wait before being seated ;)"}
{"text":"What à Nice terrasse to sit and have Dinner In the heart of St Catherine's St.... Not only a nice outdoor and service, but the food is an explosion of flavors ... I had the spicy beef curry with coconut rice and it was Delicioussssss... My friends adore their plate too... You might have a little wait to get your plate but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant five stars if it wasn't for the long wait. The weather was perfect, we were seated outside so we didn't mind the long wait (It took an hour or so to get our plates). The food is very good, I enjoyed the level of spices and the mix of the ingredients. We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared between six of us. My favorite is lemongrass fish, very well done. I would go back and recommend it though if you are in a hurry for a quick bite, this is not a good spot."}
{"text":"Dagon. As in I'm going to eat now at this dagon restaurant.

This is the only Burmese restaurant I've found outside of the Burmese restaurant-obsessed Bay Area. Granted I didn't look everywhere, but it bears mentioning that none showed up in my Yelp search of New York City. (Update: I did find some in a Yelp search in the greater LA area.)

We tested Dagon against the 20 Bay Area Burmese restaurants we've visited and Dagon held its own.

We started with the Crispy Bean Sprout and Shrimp appetizer. This was the husband's favorite dish. I liked it a lot but felt like it was a lot of fried. To their credit it wasn't overly oily.

The tea leaf salad was quite good. However, I recommend to the owners if you're reading this to add some presentation to this dish. At every Bay Area Burmese restaurant the ingredients are all identified by the server as the salad is mixed tableside.

I'd never had lentil soup at a Burmese restaurant. Would it be like dal? It ended up being like something else entirely. My husband thought too salty, I thought just right. My daughter and I liked it a lot. 

We were tempted by the Nan Gyi Toke, a favorite dish of ours, but wanted to branch out and try the Shan Kaut Swae - noodles with chicken and shan pickles. We'd never seen it on a menu before and thought we'd try something new. It was our least favorite - though still good! - and I'm glad we got it.

It was interesting trying new dishes that we don't see in the Bay Area. We sat outside on a deck on the street on the warm night. It felt like we waited a long time for food, but I think that was because all the food arrived at the same time, instead of the appetizer and salad arriving first like I would expect.

{"text":"Maybe they were just having an off-night. It was a Friday night, and I went by myself. There were two other couples sitting in the restaurant. I was seated at a table on the wall, where where was a baseboard heater that nearly burned my leg it was so hot. Even after I moved the table away from the wall, it was still very uncomfortable. I ordered an appetizer and a main course. The appetizer, a salad, took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. The restaurant was nearly empty, and no one was coming in for pick-up orders. My main course, chicken in what was supposed to be a spicy and fragrant curry sauce, was dry as a bone, and the sauce bland. Perhaps, coming from a larger metropolis, I am accustomed to different Burmese food, or they could have been having an off-night."}
{"text":"My first Burmese food experience- a mix of curry, lemongrass and other typical southeast Asian cuisine. Asked for medium spice but not spicy at all, And so I question the authenticity of the cuisine- not that I know how real Burmese food tastes like, but according to my childhood memory during my 1-week visit in Burma, there are a lot more exotic ingredients & flavours than a simple plain beef curry, fish curry or a stir-fly noodle that taste like westernized pad Thai, etc. However, I would still recommend it if you want a comfort home-cooking Asian food place in the village that serve wines at only $5 more than SAQ - and can always count it as a backup plan for your group when Red Tiger is full."}
{"text":"Great Burmese food in the Gay Village. 

My husband and I happened upon this spot for a late lunch. They have a diverse lunch menu. The lunch deal includes a lemonade and a spring roll, both of which really hit the spot. 

Our main dishes were very different but both very good. I would say the chicken dish was a little more unique, but the coconut curry with noodles was also very good. 

The people who work here were very nice and interesting to chat with about the Burmese population in Montreal, which is minimal."}
