{"text":"By far the best biscuits and gravy I've had so far. Pancakes are delicious. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think a great cafe would be hidden in this nondescript industrial plaza, but inside is a really nice cafe with excellent breakfast and lunch food. Definitely an East Valley gem if in area."}
{"text":"Get the egg tacos, add avocado. YUM.  The #20 omelette was good too, have it scrambled. Great service!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Small and cramped and always a wait but worth it. Fresh food, generous portions. Straight forward American breakfast classics. Nothing pretentious about this place. Charming old building and a great breakfast.  i've tried 5 or 6 different breakfasts and have enjoyed every meal."}
{"text":"First time ever coming here. The cinnamon rolls were delicious. We shared the #10 and #20 omelettes because we couldn't decide and they were both great! We also had an awesome waitress with great service, it's really hard to find that nowadays. My only complaint is that the eggs were maybe a little overcooked and dry and the coffee was $5. Other than that we had a really good breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to try this place?! Well, it's because there is almost always a line out the door. But now I understand why. The restaurant is tiny, but they can turn tables relatively quickly, and the food is fabulous! The cinnamon roll is to die for! It would be a meal in and of itself for one person. We split it among 3 people which let us share in the deliciousness, but not spoil our appetites as there was much more food to come. I got the ham and cheese scramble, which came with home fries, and I was able to eat almost half of it. Even as leftovers one day later, it was still excellent. They do a cute Mickey Mouse pancake with whipped cream for kids that my daughter thoroughly enjoyed. We took some of that home as well, and as with my food, it was still tasty in its encore show. We will definitely be coming back as we have only scratched the surface of the breakfast menu, and there's a whole lunch menu, too!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, there is no question.  The restaurant is small and the wait times are typically excessive.  The only place to wait is outside and with breakfast being their busiest time, the building facing east (with little shade) and being on a Gilbert Rd the wait ends up ruining the experience in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is where you go for breakfast and where you will return again and again and again.  My wife and I have been here 20+ times and have never been disappointed by friendliness of service, quality of food and speed of delivery.  

Eat: any of the scrambles / omelets.  I go for the avocado and bacon with tomato and my wife loves the spinach, mushroom and bacon.  What I LOVE about Farmhouse is you can substitute the sides (like potatoes and bread) for cottage cheese, tomatoes or fruit, etc.  I tip more because they do this without the upcharge so many other restaurants hit you with.  The gals are awesome anyway.  Keep rockin!

Don't Eat: pancakes, waffles, cinnamon rolls.  The bread / wheat dishes here just do not compare to the scrambles and omelets.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother.

Be VERY CAREFUL of coming between 8-10am on the weekend.  Best to get here right when opens or wait til after noon.  Nothing worse than waiting in the hot AZ heat just to sit down and get your breakfast on.

This spot kills the competition for breakfast.  Thank you, Farmhouse!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and cozy. The food was very tasty and good sized portions. The waitresses were so nice and polite. The place is small so arriving early would be helpful in getting a seat. Overall I would love to go back more times. I was so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and outstanding food. We went there based on a review from yelp and I was so impressed I had to come here to help support them. A must go to place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I am always so excited to eat at the Farmhouse.  I enjoyed my roast beef sandwich, and LOVED my coleslaw.  The service was so bad that my mother and I felt so uncomfortable being there.  we got there at 1:30 and knew that they closed at 2 so we were trying to be polite and order fast. Everything we asked for we would get an eye roll and an obvious \"hurry up\" look.  If you don't want to serve anyone at 1:30 then quit serving people and we were not the only people the there.  I gave it 3 stars because I loved my food, but probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"A Gilbert staple! 

Super cute atmosphere! I had fresh squeezed orange juice and PANCAKES THE SIZE OF MY FACE. 

They were perfect, creamy, not too sweet...I should not have eaten all that food at once but it was sooo yummy! :D"}
{"text":"Always my favorite place to go to breakfast on Sunday, there is always a line but the wait is usually short. Can't beat the home style cooking and fast friendly service. Biscuits and gravy just Like my mom made em."}
{"text":"Eggs where runny. Yolks where raw. Asked for a diet soda as I am diabetic and can't have juice. The waitress never brought my cold drink and thus I had to attempt to wash my hot food down with my hot coffee. I choked profusely. The waitress did her best to avoid our table with having had only 3 visits to our table. Once for drinks then taking our order and last to give us the check. No tip no return for us. Is customer srvc. Dead???"}
{"text":"Service is amazing.  The environment and atmosphere is so comfy here. The food, well, that is super amazing. It's like the cook actually cares about his/her work. I like this little place n will definitely be back. Been wanting to come here for about 5 years now. We finally made it"}
{"text":"Worth. The. Wait.

On a weekend morning (including Friday, curiously) expect a minimum wait of 20 minutes.  There are a couple of benches outside to sit on if there's room, and they have shades hung so you don't fry while you're waiting, but even if you're standing in the blazing sun, it's worth the wait.

The new location (the old one was a mile or so south, in a real farmhouse) is in downtown Gilbert, in an adobe building between a furniture store and small grocery.  There are cool wood-plank floors, antiques sprinkled around, and cozy tables.  The tableware is also very homey - mismatched plates and utensils that contribute to the old farm kitchen feel of the place.  It's clean and well-lit and very, very, very busy.

The wait staff is excellent, demonstrated by their efficient handling of the unending throngs of diners.  The servers are friendly and accommodating, and never fail to crack a joke or exchange some type of pleasantry that makes one feel welcome.  They understand the meaning of \"extra crispy\" in relation to potatoes, and communicate requests well to the cook.  My tea test (iced tea glass refilled at 3/4 empty at a minimum, and never allowed to go dry) may seem like a slam-dunk here, since they serve the tea in gigantic 32-ounce glasses, but I can drink gallons, and they've always passed the test with flying colors.  Once you're seated and the meal is ordered, the food arrives quickly.

The breakfast menu is somewhat typical, with omelets, scrambles, French toast, pancakes, but there's something magical in the preparation and the quality of ingredients.  Daily specials are listed on a board outside the door, and are creative and usually quite good.  The lunch menu and daily midday specials lean heavily towards comfort food (open-faced roast beef and gravy sandwich, meatloaf and mashed potatoes, roast chicken, etc.) with the usual cast of burger and sandwich characters thrown in for good measure.  Portions are hearty, and prices are fair.

The omelets are at least three egg, and are filled to capacity.  There are a huge number of combinations, and all that I have tried have been excellent.  The vegetables are fresh and crisp-tender, the meat is abundant, the cheese is melty, and the eggs fluffily hold it all together.  The Farmhouse's iced tea is my favorite iced tea in the state of Arizona.  It's just straight-up, strong brewed tea (no passionfruit, raspberry or sweeteners), clear, brisk and delicious.  The coffee is really good, too, and I'm not a huge coffee drinker.  It's served in traditional thick white ceramic mugs, and is dark, fragrant and strong, without any bitterness.  We've tried a couple of specials, including a Mexican-style scramble with pork green chile that is fabulous.  The default bread at breakfast is not toast - it's whole wheat French bread, sliced on the bias and buttered and grilled.  It sounds weird, but it's really, really good - warm and soft with a nicely crisped, buttery top.

The only thing I didn't like here was the chicken fried steak, which is only offered on weekends.  I know it's ghetto, but I like mine made with a steak that's been pushed through the cuber so much that it closely resembles a hamburger, and can be cut with a fork.  Chicken fried steak at the Farmhouse is made with a real steak; no cube steak or hamburger.  The coating is light and crispy, and the gravy is great, but it was too fibrous and \"steaky\" for me.

I haven't ever had the revered cinnamon roll, but I did try a berry cobbler once (a la mode) and it was incredibly good - sweet and syrupy with juicy ripe berries and a flaky, buttery crust.

High-quality ingredients, careful preparation, superior service and the feeling like you're in your grandma's kitchen combine to make the wait all worthwhile at The Farmhouse."}
{"text":"Love, LOve, LOVE this place.  I have followed the Farmhouse from one location to the present.  I have never had a bad meal there.  GREAT place for lunch...BETTER place for breakfast.
Service has always been very good.
The restaurant is small, so sometimes have to wait..but is well worth it."}
{"text":"Ate at the Farmhouse on Sunday November 2nd, 2008.. I ordered 1 wheat pancake, and 1 buttermilk pancake (decent enough) with Bacon (dried out) and 1 over-easy egg (cooked perfectly).. 

The food was ok, not out of this world. I prefer Brunchies in downtown Chandler off of Boston and Arizona or  LIBERTY MARKET right next door!!

The only problem with the meal was that the bacon was dried out. It was very fragile. Not sure if this is the norm, but not edible.

After eating at Liberty Market I have determined it to be much better than this mediocre fare from The Farmhouse.. To have to wait for up to 1 hour for this food isn't worth the wait.. I suspect they prefer more about the volume of sheep that come through the door to eat their food, than the quality of food they serve. They cram you in like sardines and serve you over cooked food.. 

1, just one overcooked item on ANY plate ruins the entire dining experience! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This could be the worst food I have ever had. The fact that people wait in line for this defines that many people either do not have any taste buds or simply do not care how there food taste. My wife and I both ate one bite out of the meals and that was it!! 
Unless you are only trying to feel a void this is the last place to come. Sorry farm house, need to work on the food!!"}
{"text":"Any chance I get, I come here on Wednesday and Friday  for the fantastic chicken specials. Great service and the best food. Yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years! Love the breakfast Burros!!!  Awesome food, and great service."}
{"text":"The best Cobb salad I have ever had!!! Portion is huge and the honey mustard dressing with a side of whole wheat French bread is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great food ,service and worth the wait. 
Staff is awesome and food is high quality and priced right. Best tuna sandwich I have had in a long time. Wish they could take over the space where Liberty Market is. Was in there one day and they prepared a meal for what appeared to be a homeless man. They were generous and kind and treated him with dignity. Very Impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"Five stars for the breakfast skillets. The one with bacon/sausage/eggs is delicious and the best of its kind that I've had anywhere.

The place is in one of the oldest buildings in downtown Gilbert, with adobe walls that lean 5-10 degrees but have not fallen down."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience here with the food or the people.  Sometimes the wait for a table seems long, but hey, would you rather go to a place that never has lines (or people)?  The chicken and dumplings are sssoooo good.  The portions are huge, so do not blame this place if you are on a diet.  This place is wonderful for breakfast and lunch, so if you prefer eating out when the sun is still up, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great home-cooked style breakfast/lunch diner.

I LOVE the pancakes and syrup here! I have eaten them so many times. I think they are just from Krusteaz mix, but I can't make them at home like they do. Not even close.

Their omletes are big and tasty, stuffed with great ingredients of your choice.

Most of the dishes are hearty and tasty. Nothing fancy, but definitely WAY better than I dare say IHOP or Denny's? Ya, it's not even a comparison.

I'm not a fan of the much celebrated cinnamon roll. It tasted a bit sour and bland to be honest.

Most of the staff are friendly, though usually busy."}
{"text":"Ordered Mike's veggie sandwich, probably the worst sandwich I've ever had at a restaurant. If you are a vegetarian or vegan I recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place has EXCELLENT food, with generous helpings!
Maybe that's why in the AM it usually has a bit of a line.
I've never been disappointed, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in the EV.  Always great service and the food is fresh and flavorful. I could do with out the wait especially since its on a busy road and you standing on the sidewalk lol. However I highly recommend the farmhouse and worth the wait. LOVE IT LOL."}
{"text":"Wow! This was my first time here and was I pleased with my choice. Great small restaurant.  There just aren't to many restaurants with this small town atmosphere any more. I had the #19 omelet w sour cream bacon green chilies sausage and cheese highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's regular breakfast. Each time I see a huge line waiting I just go next door, eat my breakfast, and walk out and laugh at those still waiting. Staff wasn't all that friendly. I don't get it?? Good for them."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant out.  After waiting about 20 minutes, outside in the heat, we were finally seated.  Service was very good and the restaurant has a feel of a hometown restaurant joint.  

I am a huge fan of country fired steak and eggs, so was happy to see that it was the special.  When the food came out, it was a huge portion.  Enough for leftovers.  The biscuits sat on-top of the setak and was smothered in gravy.  A great start.  But nothing on the plate blew me away.  The biscuits were quite dry.  The steak was good, but was a little too thick for my liking.  The breading was also not my favorite.  I like a crispier breading.  

Overall, this restaurant was ok, but probably will not return.  Maybe if I am out in Gilbert, but other than that its not worth my drive."}
{"text":"Showed up at 945am. Was third on the list behind a 2 groups of 2. They were clearing two 2 person booth and just had a party of six leave.  Hostess went and split the table of six and seated a group of four and two that showed up after us.

40 minutes go by and we see them again sit a a group of 4 and 2 that showed up after us and could of had the table push together for us. Gave up after close to 70 minute wait. When we were number  3 on the wait list.

Dont bother if you group is over 5. Wouldnt bother if have more then 2 in our party.

Go next door to liberty market were you have better service and a friender staff"}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to go eat at this place. The decoration inside is really unique!  Food is really good and prices are affordable. Will be back again and again ! And they have a special dish for each day of the week! !"}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service! The food came fast.. And it would have been worth it if there was a wait! It was awesome! I definitely recommend going there! Ill be going there next time I go out!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! My husband and I both had omelettes which were delicious. Their potatoes were seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was perfectly cooked. The bowl of fresh fruit was to die for. Chicken fried steak was excellent and the gravy was delicious. The vegetarian omelette was very tasty. Small inside, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"5-14-13. We just left the farm house after an agonizing 45 minute wait for the food which was only ok and luke warm at best.  We thought we would try something different on Columbus Day but obviously should've  stayed with our usual breakfast  places. It is now easy to understand why this restaurant has not received any \"best of\" ratings since 2005!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Very nicely prepared.  Love the atmosphere.  Very dependable."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse Restaurant is a good choice for breakfast...great coffee and the food is as close to homemade as you'll find when eating out.  I had a mushroom and spinach scramble with potatoes and toasted baguette. ( I would just like to note, for the chef, to please consider chopping the spinach first.)  My biggest complaint about this restaurant, is the total lack of comfort and ambience.   It is very noisy and busy with small tables and chairs crowded together...not really the place to have a relaxing meal.  The wait for a table can sometimes be long and everyone must wait outside, as there is no hostess station or foyer, which is confusing to some.  I wanted to like this restaurant,  but the lack of ambience just made the whole experience to stressful and I found myself breathing a sigh of relief as I walked out the door."}
{"text":"The Ruben was to die for. The dressing was obviously homemade. The service was great. Everyone in our party loved their meal."}
{"text":"The cinnamon roll and bacon, tomato and avocado omelette were simply out of this world! Best French bread toasts ever..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! My friends and I tried this small but quaint restaurant on a late Friday morning.  ( One friend lived in town and had tried the food before; the rest of us were visiting). There was no wait for a seat but I know that weekends are probably busy, given the steady stream of people who came in while we dined. We had omelets: one was a spinach, bacon, & cheese omelet while another was a ham, cheese, tomato and bacon omelet. Both were very yummy! Another friend had the pancakes which were nearly the size of the whole plate. Everything that we ordered tasted fresh and was well seasoned. Each omelet order came with home fries snd french bread toast. Two thumbs up to the chef! This is a must visit place when you come to Gilbert."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place for a long time and I am so glad we finally did. The farmhouse is in a cute little house near downtown gilbert. It has a lot of old town charm. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. Can't wait to go back.!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait but its definitely worth it.  Food is consistently great and has a homemade feel.  Their breakfast is the best in Gilbert....Love their pancakes and chocolate milk!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! Amazingly attentive service!! Coffee was hot and fresh, not too acidic and definitely not weak. I had biscuits and gravy, the wife had an omelette. The kids are a Mickey Mouse pancake and Belgian waffles with chocolate chips. An excellent breakfast for all. Big smiles all around."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the fist time yesterday! We went in a little late, maybe 1ish so the wait wasn't long at all.  Even the party of 9 ahead of us were surprised they got called so soon. I loved being able to sit by the window to see the activity outside while we waited for or food! Service was great, and breakfast was delicious! Unfortunately I didn't get to try the Cinnabon, which I had planned to but I was pretty satisfied with the big portion of food I got.  

I got an omelette and house fries. It's a pretty decent size and the bacon in my omelette was DELICIOUS! 
I will definitely be coming back, especially to try the cinnamon roll!"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place!!! Excellent breakfast!! LOVE the whole-wheat french bread toast--sooo good! The wait is always long on the weekends, but it's worth it. And cheap prices too! And in the heart of the tiny downtown Gilbert- so cute."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for breakfast. The food is amazing and the decor is very cozy. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best for breakfast. Love the feel of eating at your grandmother's house."}
{"text":"Long wait to be seated but it was worth it! 
-Excellent service 
-Great food 
-Recommend: Omelet - we had a few different ones at our table. The green chile pork omelet was great and the spinach was fresh on the egg white omelet."}
{"text":"This breakfast was pretty close to perfect!  It was my first time here and I had one of the daily specials - eggs scrambled with a ton of fresh veggies and cheese, served with a side of spicy salsa verde and sliced/spiced potatoes. Delicious!  Veggies were cooked perfectly and the salsa was fresh and added just the right amount of heat. My companion ordered a warm cinnamon roll topped with cream-cheese frosting ... Heavenly. Service was super sweet and efficient. Add a hot, bottomless cup of coffee and pull into satiation station!  If next visit is as good as this one, I'll be adding another star to my review!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for breakfast with some friends. It was a Sunday so we had to wait a bit with the rest of the rush but the shades and benches outside were more than we needed. Our food was good, nothing fancy, but my favorite meal includes all the breakfast basics. I had the egg sandwich and it was plenty of food. We split a cinnamon roll, too, which was excellent. The service was good and the atmosphere is that of a small town diner. All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy on Sunday afternoon, great service, simple comfortable decor, mediocre food (tried the omelette & cinnamon roll).  Not good enough to return for."}
{"text":"This place is very small you have to get there as soon as they open or you won't get a seat. The food was OK the hash browns were too crispy for my taste."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to go here because she has always wanted to go there. So we go there there are 2 open tables. We wait about 15 minutes and no server ever acknowledged that we were there. Very rude people. We just got stared down by everyone and the servers. They wouldn't even look at us or anything. Very small place and very annoying place. We left and went to ihop and was greeted right away there. We will never try to go to farmers market again it was a waste of time."}
{"text":"After an hour wait on the list they asked our party of 6 to split up. They don't have what it takes to accommodate families. I didn't get to eat here and never will but I can tell their customer service is seriously lacking!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a sign up sheet outside the front door. It is very easy to keep tabs of our placement on the list. There were several names ahead of us when we signed in. Our family of 5 looked forward to breakfast. After waiting 45 minutes one couple was ahead of us.When the bus boy seated that couple, he also seated a couple who had just arrived, placing them at a large table for 5 or 6 people. It turns out one of the members of the couple was his brother. We complained to the manager about preferential seating of the second couple ahead of us. She would not acknowledge the problem or offer an apology. Instead she made excuses pointing to a previous customer name to cover up their mistake. Either she is clueless or a liar. We left and went to Biscuits and had a great meal. 

If i could give this restaurant zero stars, I would have. The rudeness was an insult!"}
{"text":"The wait sucks but what's a good restaurant without a wait right? They literally have the best breakfast evr!! I wake up every weekend craving this place. And to top it off they have tapatio sauce!  Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"Has a wonderful omlette. Toast was amazing. My friend got the pancakes and said they were the best she ever had. Friendly service. Be prepared to wait. ALWAYS a line. Super cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"The wait staff was ok, they were busy and we had to ask for basic things multiple times. Menus, straws and even silverware.
The food was great! Very fresh ingredients made to order. The egg tacos and home fries were a must have. Biscuits and gravy were on point. Make an omelet into a burrito and you have two meals, they are huge but great. The pancakes are fluffy and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is always good. It doesn't matter what you order, it is delicious! That's why there is always a line to get in. I go here often and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in the east valley. Its simple food done right, the kind of food that reminds you of country breakfast or breakfast that your grandmother cooked. Either way its happiness."}
{"text":"Big, comfort food! You won't leave hungry. Their scrambles are enormous and the veggies are always fresh tasting. They use quality ingredients in all their food. One of the best sausage gravies I've ever had. The menu will make you want to try one of everything. It's hard to make a bad pick but don't over-order, like I always do, or you'll be boxing up leftovers for later. The Farmhouse is a Gilbert staple and a neat tribute to its roots as a farming community."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Maybe the food is good, but we never got the chance to figure that out. My family and i went there a few days ago because we heard it was good. There was a wait since it was a Saturday morning. My husband stood inside with our 2 month old because it's the middle of summer in Arizona. Well the hostess told my husband that he could not stand inside. He told her that he wasn't going to wait outside with his baby. She said sorry but they were a fire hazard. Total bull shit! Even the people eating by where my husband was standing were appalled. We decided to choose Postinos for our brunch. They were VERY friendly and even offered us water while we waited. Needless to say, we won't be giving The Farmhouse a second chance."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I love The Farm House. It is a bit cramped and busy but since I'm usually dining solo, the counter always has a place open. The daily special scrambles are very tasty and each order comes with home fried potatoes and whole wheat french bread. The coffe is also very good as well as they use Illy coffee. One thing to look out for if you sit at the counter is that you come face to face with two of their fresh made chocolate cakes. It takes every inch of my will power not to order a slice, but alas chocolate cake has won out a couple of times."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  This place serves lunch too but I've never had it.  I go for the big breakfast.  The plates are huge and I can only eat half of my meal, which is scrambled eggs, potatoes and toast.  It's usually packed but it's worth the wait.  The waiters are always nice and quick.  I wish the place was open all day so I could have brinner (breakfast & dinner).  The restaurant is clean and I like the old farmhouse decor."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for breakfast. Fast, delicious, and cozy. Best cinnamon rolls around!"}
{"text":"I just ate there this morning, because I have heard so many things about it and read a lot about it. I have tried to go here in the past but they have always been very busy so I finally made it.

I wanted to not just order eggs and something, not much variation there so I ordered the biscuit and sausage gravy and French toast. 

First the good point was the biscuit and gravy, especially the gravy. It was probably the best gravy I have ever had. Very smooth and rich with full flavors of just right salt and pepper. The sausage bits were great and very tasteful. The gravy was definite a 5 star, the biscuit a 3 star. It was nothing special, not flaky or tender, like an afterthought. The waitress convince me to order just a half order, so I thought it must be huge but turned out to be just a normal everyday biscuit. 

The other part of the order was the french toast. This was a disappointment, it was burnt and I came there early so there was no crowd there, so there should be no excuse for that. It was your everyday french toast, nothing to write about, something I could have done in my own kitchen. Last was the coffee, which again was average.

So I have to give it a 3-1/2 if I knew how  but decided upon 3 for now, because again the gravy was spectacular but the others were average to below average. I hope to go there in the future and maybe try other things and I may change the rating but for now it is that.

Just wanted to say, I came here a couple of more time after the first review, because, first I don't want to judge a place by just one visit. I had the scramble and potatoes and it was very disappointing. I will still say it is a 3 star but barely."}
{"text":"Enormous portions. Good home-style food. Quick friendly service. Only downfall is limited seating."}
{"text":"Yes, order the cinnamon roll. It is fresh, fluffy, warm goodness in your mouth. If you can take it all at once, go big and order for just yourself (no sharing)!  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and subbed avocado for bacon and fruit for potatoes. I had the egg over-hard.  Next time i would go light on the cheese (which was on the egg).  Service is great, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Had to wait to get in. Well worth it.
Ordered biscuits & gravy. GREAT! 
Very fluffy biscuits.
Everything was great

{"text":"The bacon sour cream and green onion omelette is packed with delicious bacon bits. You will have a wait here but is worth it. Delicious cinnamon rolls here as well. Salivating just thinking about that omelette again!"}
{"text":"By far THE breakfast place in the area.  Nothing tops the fresh food, good service and hometown environment of The Farmhouse\" Two thumbs up and a tail wag!"}
{"text":"Want amazing traditional American breakfast fare?   This is your place!  It even feels like you're at the family breakfast table, a little bit!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my go to breakfast place in the valley. The food, coffee, people and ambiance is just the best! If you're looking for a fantastic breakfast look no further. It is always consistent, hot and oh so delicious! Carrie, Jamie and Nicole will make you feel welcome and are amazing at what they do :)"}
{"text":"Small town feel, but too cramped. I swear my scrambled \"thing\" had one egg, and way too much cheese. Not in any rush to go back, though the service was ok and the ambiance was still nice."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since they were in a real old farm house in the middle of a farm field near Gilbert & Warner in the late 1980's. It was great to be able to enjoy good food in a cute setting not far from where we lived, when Gilbert was still a very small town. It was a quaint little place owned by a mother and daughter.  It was a disappointment when they were forced (by what we heard was an outrageous raise in rent) to move into downtown Gilbert. However, the food and service continued to be great, as usual. Perhaps they no longer need the business since they are now surrounded by many other restaurants, and finding another one without long wait might be difficult. I have taken every out of town visitor I have ever had to the Farmhouse, and it did not disappoint. However, in mid February I went there for what will be the last time.  First, there is no indoor waiting area, and it was a cold morning. I was meeting a friend for breakfast on a Sunday at 9:00 a.m. I arrived a bit early in anticipation of a long wait. There were two parties ahead of me, one with 2 people and the other with 4. Within about 10 minutes they were seated. By that time a couple more small groups had arrived.  I saw my friend turn onto Page at about the same time as \"Emma\", an incredibly rude hostess, called my name. When I got to within a couple of feet of her she said, in an irritated voice, \"Where is the rest of your party?\". I explained that my friend would be there quickly, but was not given a chance to tell her that I had actually seen her turn the corner to find a parking place, usually at least 1 block away.  She cut me off from saying anything else, and told me I could not be seated because my entire party was not present (1 other person), and that that is now their \"policy\". I asked if I could come in (it was cold), and get a cup of coffee.  I received a resounding \"No\". I do not believe there are any tables for \"one\" at this restaurant, so it was not as if I was going to be pushing someone out by getting in 2 minutes before the rest of my party of \"one\" and ordering a cup of coffee before ordering breakfast. \"Emma\" just ignored my request and took the next party that had arrived after me. Emma made me feel like a naughty child. My friend walked up about 1 minute later, and I explained to her what had happened. She doesn't appreciate that type of treatment, and went inside and told the first waitress she saw what had happened.  I was shocked to see that the restaurant was about 1/2 empty, with the vacant tables covered with dirty dishes. We were offered a seat at their \"counter\", but declined. After a few minutes a table was cleaned off and we were finally seated.  The food was pretty much the same as always, good, but cold potatoes.  The waitress was friendly, but service has also declined.  As the years have gone on there has definitely been a decline in quality of food and service. What began as a day I had been looking forward to by seeing an old friend was definitely affected by the treatment before I even stepped inside the restaurant. In fact, I couldn't wait to get out of there. We finished our meal, and as we were leaving I looked around and realized that about 3/4 of the restaurant was empty (around 10:30 am on a Sunday morning), and every single vacant table was covered with dirty dishes. There was a large number of people lingering around the front of the restaurant, waiting to be seated.  I don't know what has happened to this place, but I will never go back.  It was always fun to explain the history of the place to my out of town friends.  Downtown Gilbert is no longer a sleepy little town with just 1 or 2 restaurants to choose from.  It will be fun to explore all the newer restaurants that I have yet to experience.  I will be surprised if the Farmhouse survives the emergence of all the new great restaurants in downtown Gilbert, especially with such absolutely rude employees as \"Emma\", the first person you make contact with, and their new \"policy\" prohibiting one person from being seated before the rest of their party of \"one\" has arrived, after standing outside on a cold morning for about 15 minutes.  It's sad to see how much this restaurant has declined-half empty with the other half with tables covered with dirty dishes, while customers are lingering on the sidewalk outside, waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Will definitely be back. Only reason I didn't rate them at five stars is because of the service. It's a small place so it shouldn't be hard to take care of a few tables. Our waitress came to the table maybe three times, wasn't very friendly and didn't really make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"A quaint place located in the heritage district in Gilbert.  If you are lucky, you can get right in and get a table.  The staff is very pleasant and the food is actually really good.  I always get a scramble and a cup of coffee.  A scramble is basically an omelet that was smarter then the cook and kind of exploded everywhere.  Customize one to your liking and you will be happy.  The restaurant can be very crowded sometimes... but can't blame them... you Arizonans are slow eaters.  Remember, always eat locally."}
{"text":"The sausage gravy was too sweet. Everything else was good. Busy place, so get there early."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Very hearty breakfast. The wait times are long but that comes with popularity I suppose.  We've been twice and we'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I have always like going here, and today was no better time. It's maybe 50 something degree out and I wanted really good breakfast. So I order the perfect meal biscuit and sausage gravy! So good darn good, the quality and presentation was there! My server was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"We had friends that recommended this cute little place.  We arrived in time for brunch and there was a line and a waiting list.  The weather was nice as we sat outside waiting for our table.  We perused the menu and was impressed with their offerings.
We waited about 20 minutes to be seated, but service was speedy.  
We each ordered something differnt from the menu and were amazed at the portions! My vegetable omlette was so tasty and their homefries are not to missed.  Another must have....their homeade cinnamon rolls!
We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were visiting Az near Memphis, TN and wanted to eat at a place that reminded us of food served at home. We were well pleased with the level of service, portion sizes and taste of the food, it was simply delicious!! I would recommend this eatery to visitors."}
{"text":"These guys were actually fairly busy on a weekday. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with home fries. The sandwich was large and tasty. The bacon was crispy and the egg was well made. I even ended up taking half of the sandwich home. The home fries actually made me quite nostalgic- they reminded me of the way my grandma used to make breakfast potatoes. The waitress was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Good food, cozy atmosphere and attentive and very nice service. The top three most important things about a restaurant were home runs!"}
{"text":"Cute place in downtown Gilbert. Average food higher than average price for what you get. The best thing I had was a side of French Toast, although nothing like at Crackers. Eggs were average. Can't say I'd return."}
{"text":"I came here looking for chicken pot pie and I found it. Delicious and filling it hit the spot . I also enjoyed the carrots.  I would recommend this to you !"}
{"text":"Really upset that the green chili pork omelets are out. Literally only reason my family and I came to this place. Other than that, food is great, staff amazing!"}
{"text":"I love good waitresses, and The Farmhouse has the best I've ever seen. Our group of six had special orders...the waitresses even brought our babies food a full 10 minutes before ours, a thoughtful gesture indeed. Food is amazing, I guess you can't give a better compliment than that. Bring an extra artery or two, you'll need it :)"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time being here. I thought maybe the first time was just a fluke. The food here is AMAZING!  The omelets are huge and the potatoes are cooked to perfection. I got the #10 omelette with sourcream, green onions and potatoes and added avocados and green chili....it was phenomenal and huge!  The coffee comes in a huge cup...you don't have to worry about refills so soon. The service is wonderful,  everyone is so nice and polite. The food taste so so good. I'm already planning what I will get on my next visit, since there is so many choices to make. If you have a chance to try this place...don't miss it! But make sure you come hungry,  the servings are big!"}
{"text":"Aside from our grumpy waitress who sucked at her job, everyone was friendly and helpful. The cinnamon roll was great, like a homemade Cinnabon. Omelette and scramble pairings were very creative. The toast was weird enough that I'd ask for an alternative next time."}
{"text":"The best word to describe this place is COZY. This restaurant isn't for pretentious people. It was much smaller than I expected it to be, it had such a welcoming country kitchen nook feel. I tried one of their scrambles and boy was it tasty, it came with a wheat baguette and country potatoes. It was a lot of food, I could only finish half. The prices were good too, cheaper than its neighbor Liberty Market.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, I came on a late Saturday afternoon (1:30pm is late for them because they close at 2pm) and there was no wait. I even ordered an cinnamon roll to-go and hands down it was one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted. I will be back here for certain."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. We live just down the road from here for two years and were definitely regulars! Sadly we moved and are now on the other part of the city, but I will say its worth the drive if you get a chance. They have some off the all amazing specials that often run our, but this is the real deal when it comes to home made fantastic food! They even sever mimosas!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the roasted chicken lunch special for $13 and the only thing good on my plate was the mashed potatoes. It came with coleslaw, which makes no sense when the other sides are mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry and a roll. There should be a vegetable served with it. The chicken was flavorless, the stuffing dry and flavorless, the gravy looked and tasted canned and my entire plate of food was swimming in it. I tried my husband's pancakes and they were nothing amazing. Also, his biscuits looked good but they were cold and weren't that great. Don't be fooled by the wait out front, the place is tiny and therefore seats very few. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We live on the other side of town but had an appointment in Gilbert. We stopped for breakfast and they did not disappoint. All of the staff is so grit and the food was great. I'll definitely come back the next time we are over this way"}
{"text":"Waited a really long time for a table, which is ok if the food is worth it, but this wasn't. It took a long time to get a server to come to our table. Once she cane the server was nice but it was so long to get her there, we were a party of 6 and it was like we were invisible.

My friend and I each for a hot chocolate and they were luke warm. Then when food came only half of it came. The other half took awhile. Then the food was not great. I had an omelet with \"well done\" hashbrowns and their house baggett. The bread was burnt, the peppers in the omlet were raw and hash browns were barely cooked. 

On top of that, we had all studied the menu hanging outside while waiting but when we got inside the menu was slightly different, missing the item I was settled on getting and the prices were way higher!! Not a little, a lot! Hostess said the menu updated a couple weeks ago, I can't believe they had not updated the one out front! 

We will never be back. Or friends suggested the place saying the wait was worth it.... definitely not true. If there had been no wait, it still wouldn't be worth it."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.  I've been coming here since they were located in an actual farmhouse down the road.  The eggs are fantastic and always cooked to order.  That's a big deal for me...  If you ask for over medium you get it!  A definite spot for a good home style breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Downside, usually a wait but not too long and worth it! It's like eating at grandmas for breakfast, (if she is a good cook), always enjoyed the food staff is very friendly and polite. Prices are extremely reasonable. Their coffee is great too! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Saw this on Yelp and the front desk attendant at the Residence Inn recommended it as his #1 choice. It did not disappoint. We got there early as I had a flight out, and got right in. Service was great and fast. The pancakes, French toast and potatoes were all great. My guess is that it would've been pretty busy a little later, but I would say it would've been definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Omelette I had was spinach, cheese, bacon and mushroom...fantastic with their hash browns and scratch biscuits!  Small, quaint family owned in Downtown Gilbert is a must dining experience!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place more times than I can count. For the most part, I'm not big on breakfast. I like it, but its an occasional thing. We decided to go out for breakfast this morning and I thought we should give this place a shot.

Good call! This place is great. Its a little small and there is a little bit of a wait but the food and service were on point!

The wife orders coffee, an egg white omelet with ham, bacon, jalapeno and cheese. It comes with potatoes and toast and looks amazing!

I go for a glass of OJ and their breakfast special: a green chile and pork omelet. They served it with potatoes and a fresh, warm tortillas. Think New Mexico mornings!!! AWESOME!!!

All in all a great place. We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great food in a small cafe feel. We got several different items I must say the cinnamon roll was by far the best item. It is a meal for one or a nice shareable item. New to the area it was great to have a nice local restaurant. We will be back for the home cooking again."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars!

We stopped by here for a quick breakfast after browsing the Farmer's Market around the corner.  Because of the timing, we were seated pretty quickly, but I could see the long wait if your party is larger 4+. 

The breakfast sandwich: BLT with a fried egg + cheese was good, hearty and a bit greasy.  The spinach, tomato, mushroom, sautéed onion omelet was sadly just ok, wished the egg was fluffier.  

The service was great - fast, friendly, and lots of smiles."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try from seeing it on yelp. Henhouse is our favorite place and wanted to try something different. It was not too bad and would go back. Husband surprisingly liked the biscuits and gravy. Cute little place in Gilbert. Daughter loved her french toast and said she would go back."}
{"text":"Great little place. Solid food. Really nice atmosphere. Wait staff was friendly and accommodating. After traveling all morning across the country I was happy to find this place just a couple of minutes from my hotel. I was craving a breakfast or brunch and this place was a nice alternative to a chain. Liked it so much I finally signed up for a yelp account and wrote this review while still sitting at the farmhouse counter."}
{"text":"I never have the patience to come in and wait on the weekends. I came in on a Wednesday morning and was very pleased. Our server was attentive and very courteous. I ordered an egg white omelet and it was done exactly how I like it! I love that they give you the option to do egg whites. Potatoes were great as well! The line is ALWAYS long on the weekend so come on a weekday for a slower pace."}
{"text":"The very best breakfast in town. VERY big portion and the atmosphere is great, farmhouse kitchen table. Five stars for every aspect of my first trip there. I promise you will not regret it. If you go on the weekend you will wait in line to get in, but they have a patio that you might get in faster if you are willing to sit outside. When you write your name on the list put next to is Patio and you will get seated faster."}
{"text":"Every time we drive by, we see a huge line so we tried them for breakfast today.  My boyfriend ordered the ham and cheese omelet, hash browns,  coffee and I got the biscuits and gravy.  I took one bite and didn't like it.  The waitress was really nice and replaced it with another meal at no charge. Oatmeal and toast.  It wasn't fully cooked or hot. I shared off my boyfriend's plate,lol. The food was ok but nothing we could see the fuss over.

The service was great.  Drinks were kept refilled, dishes cleared, as needed, check brought w/o having to ask for it.

We got there at the perfect time-not busy.  By the time we left, there was over an hour wait so I can't comment on what it's like when they are busy.

The menu and prices are typical for this kind of place.  Overall, we won't eat there again but there must be something that we missed on our visit that draws such a huge crowd on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Great waitstaff. Delicious omelettes fill you up for the day. There is a wait on weekends so sign up outside and get ready for some excellent food."}
{"text":"This place sits right next to Liberty Market and I've always seen it with a long line for breakfast - I understand why, now.  There are literally less than 20 tables in there and its small and crowded.. makes sense.  It took our party of 5 a while to be seated, but we had no complaints.  Our server gal was outstanding - friendly, genuine, and had a great memory (she took our order PLUS the table next to ours without writing one thing down and got our orders right!).  Their portions were also not disappointing - everyone's plate was full of food and the vegetable scramble (special) was impressive with asparagus and a colorful array of well-cooked vegetables.  My niece and I had Mimosas and they were served in a chilled chalice (sooo tasty).  The atmosphere was nice, service was excellent and the food was both tasty and plentiful - the wait was worth it!"}
{"text":"I love love love the biscuits N Gravy. Usually will get a to-go order once a month and usually on a Sunday morning. Kind of our monthly treat when we don't want to cook breakfast before church. Last time the biscuits tasted like they were tossed in the microwave as the bottom was hard and chewy. I'm 97% sure the biscuits were left over from the day before. Still a great place and won't detour me from getting biscuits n gravy again"}
{"text":"You can't do better for breakfast or brunch then the farmhouse. Just so you know you need to come early to save a spot in line, especially of you have a larger group. Their pancakes are superb. You feel like family when you go there."}
{"text":"As always, great food, excellent service and definitely get your money's worth.

Wife and I shared the chili omlette, cinnamon roll & juice... couldn't eat it all.

Simple reason why it's been our favorite breakfast joint for over 10 years."}
{"text":"Service great. French toast sooooo yummy! Bacon perfectly cooked how I requested, and the bacon is not wimpy! Home fries are seasoned with garlic - SCORE! I really enjoyed this place. The chair was uncomfortable - that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"This place in its day was the best breakfast in the valley.

Great Green Chili Pork, Awesome Biscuits and Gravy. All around awesome!! Super Awesome Omelets!

The last few time that I have gone its been slippin.  Kitchen staff hanging around on their cell phones, with gloves on, then continuing to work making food without changing their gloves. Simply unacceptable!

I have the biscuits and chipped beef gravy. Had is several times before but the gravy was luke warm, biscuits were stale. Gravy was bland, no flavor at all other than the chipped beef. Potatoes were on the toasty side.

They were busy as always.

So sad, I won't be back here until they snap back to taking care of business."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great food, great service (although we try to avoid the old server, as she's a grump) I would eat here every day if I could.  Yum.  Be prepared to wait a long time most of the time, as everyone else seems to love it too."}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast, good coffee, and delicous orange juice! I have only been here twice and im hooked. Inside the decor is old school like 1800s old. It still has some of the original structure built into the roof and high parts of the ceiling walls. For the quailty and quanity of food and service, the price is spot on perfect."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!!!

Went here with my boyfriend and his mom for a weekend brunch and was not disappointed! 

We started with a Bloody Mary and two sparkling wine plus cranberry mixes with a cinnamon roll. The drinks were refreshing and the cinnamon roll was too die for!

We then got two omelette and a chicken fried steak with eggs. The food came out fast and was hot and delicious!!! The restaurant was busy, it was Saturday morning, but everything came out in a timely manner and was cooked to perfection!

I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Always amazing here at the Farmhouse! Great portions and outta control cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh you have to try this place for breakfast. Huge portions and everything looks good here.  Great atmosphere in historic downtown. Loved it and I would go early on the weekend because it is packed."}
{"text":"When I find a good restaurant I don't argue with success. The Farmhouse is my go to breakfast place when I'm in the metro area. I had a mushroom and cheddar cheese omelet(on the money) with some great home fries and rye toast. My wife had  2 eggs with potatoes and rye toast. This place is a great  value for the money. They also sever lunch. Get there mid morning during the week and you'll have no problem getting a table."}
{"text":"The BEST for breakfast, hands down! The manager is so caring, and she waits on you right along with the cheerful staff. The dishes are always fresh and delicious. And the coffee is from Bergie's across the street -- SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"They need a larger dining room good food. Breakfast is a busy time. About 20 minutes in wait time. Staff is very friendly. Cook knows how to do eggs the right way. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"If you are going to try this restaurant, be sure and arrive early.  I was there at 10:45 for an early lunch, and it was packed.  Some of the folks were possible left overs from late breakfast, but there was a long waiting line for lunch from the time I sat down.  I had the Thursday special - enchilada plate - made vegetarian style.  I had it \"XMAS\" - one red, one green enchilada.  Truly some of the best Mexican food I have ever had, and that isn't their specialty!  Service was outstanding.  The restaurant, while small, is very clean and welcoming.  Definitely a must try, especially for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Been gojnb there for 8 months.  Went thers this morning i guess i interrupted the waitress talking about the Vikings game it was dow  hill from there.  She took our order,  didnt write if down..sent Emma the other waitress to take order.a second timd.  When she bought the order over mine was ALL wrong. My husband said my wife never orders her eggs fried since we have been coming here...the waitress actually said ...ive been here for 9 years and never seen  you in here..so my husband is a liar....she threw my plate on the table..then i ask emma the other waitress for  manager...they dont have one..food sucked her servic sucked and I will not recommend this lousy resturant to anyone..funny thing is the week before same waitress said..hey good morning nice to see you guys AGAIN. Go to Lolo`s chicken much better food..prices..and services..."}
{"text":"Super cute and Small brunch spot in drown Gilbert! Split the pancakes with the eggs and bacon with the BF -the meal is PLENTY for two! Loved the home fries on the side, sliced potatoes with a zesty seasoning.  Worth checking out if you looking for fresh breakfast served later in the day (2pm).  The lunch menu was large too, and the daily specials were tempting! Even though the place is small, wait moved quick!"}
{"text":"Farm House is a Gilbert icon, and I've been going since they inhabited the actual \"farm house\" down Gilbert Road.  Big, tasty breakfasts are the draw for me, especially the omelettes and homemade cinnamon buns. Gooey goodness!

Drawback - The Wait. If you don't get there early, it can be a heckuva wait. Be warned!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  Always a great time with family.  French Toast is delicious,  pancakes are buttery, everything is fresh and good"}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff with friendly service and even suggested menu items. It's a very tiny venue, so anticipate a wait during peak dining hours. But the wait was definitely worth the experience. Delicious, well portioned meals. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I almost don't want to rate it as highly because I don't want it to get more crowded than it already gets!
 
Adorable, cozy restaurant with a DIY wait list out front. Great coffee (straight from Bergie's across the street), farm fresh ingredients and all of the seasoned home fries. 
 
They're generous with the French vanilla creamer cups so you can bathe your delicious and readily refilled coffee in all of that creamer glory. Oh and the Cholula rests conveniently on your table, awaiting deployment over their delicious scrambles or home fries... Or both. 
 
Also: cinnamon roll. You just gotta."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse is conveniently located near Postino, a place where you will often find my car parked overnight after indulging in the board and bottle special. My husband and I decided to try the Farmhouse one morning before retrieving my car. We've lived in Gilbert for 20+ years so we are familiar with all the crowds that gather in front of the Farmhouse, but we've never tried it out.

The morning we went was blissfully empty, and our food and coffee arrived quickly. My husband got the biscuits and gravy, per usual, but he wasn't a fan of the oddly sweet gravy. I got the veggie omelette which was tons of broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms and peppers barely held together by slabs of melted cheddar and a few eggs. It was decent, but it could have used more seasoning or more flavorful veggies. I loved the wheat french bread that came on the side. Too bad they used those nasty prepackaged jellies rather than house-made jam. They also use the individual half and half containers which I don't dig. Give me the real stuff!

After visiting, I'm surprised that people wait so long for an average breakfast. I'll stick with Liberty for future car-retrieval breakfasts in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Just went there with my wife. It was our first time. She got some kind of omelet with avocado, jalapeño's and other goodies. Hers also came with the home fries, and toast. She lived hers, and it looked amazing. I tried her potatoes, and there were good and crispy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy....not so good. My biscuits were dry and had a strange texture to them. The gravy wasn't seasoned like country gravy. I needed to add salt, which I never have to do for gravy. On top of it, it came out after the omelet, and cooled down real fast. The gravy cooled to a somewhat solid consistency. We will go back, and I'll try the French toast."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse is a good place for breakfast. It's not a transcendent experience in bacon and pancakes, but you could do a lot worse. The menu is pretty much what you'd expect, and everything we had was pretty good. Honestly, though, I had a better breakfast next door, at the Liberty Market."}
{"text":"I just loved the atmosphere! It felt homey like you were at your grandmas house :) food was GREAT and the service was awesome! Will definitely be back ;)"}
{"text":"Great little spot with tasty food. Friendly staff and accommodating to our stroller. It's a small space with narrow walk ways. Leave the stroller behind if you can. The plates had decent portions. Coffee and juices were fresh. Loved the flooring and ceiling beams are gorgeous."}
{"text":"If you're a Phoenican, then you already know your city has an absolutely ridiculous number of breakfast options- and Farmhouse is the best choice, if you're voting with your taste buds!

There's always a line on the porch, which is its own form of advertising. Arrive early or ask a friend who lives nearby to put your name down and when all parties are present, you'll be seated. Our large group got the huge corner table and the sweetest server in cat-eye glasses.

But your taste buds don't care about that stuff. The menu has breakfast plate specials, nearly twenty gigantic omelet choices, and southern favorites like pancakes and biscuits. No low-carb diets allowed here!

Highly recommend the breakfast tacos (with chorizo!) or one of the omelets- the #10 (bacon, potatoes, green onion, sour cream, cheese) is huge and reminiscent of a baked potato, but in breakfast form. I'll be trying to replicate it in my own kitchen, complete with their sliced, fried, and super-crispy home fries. I'm drooling now just thinking about their food."}
{"text":"This spot came highly recommended by a work colleague. Am not much of a breakfast person but we gave it a go anyway. This review is for February 2013.

Saturday, round 9'sh, table for two. First time at The Farmhouse.

The waitlist was a bit loooong. We waited approximately 35 minutes til we were seated. Once we were seated, our server was MIA for 20 minutes. We were bout to leave when someone finally \"checked\" on us. The lady apologises for much delayed service. Instead of passing us unto another server, she immediately took our order. She also gave us one of their famous cinni-bun[sp], and apologised one more time before disappearing to the kitchen. Approx 15 mins later, our breakfast was served.
We had the pancake with eggs and bacon, and the omelette.

Cinni-bun[sp] ... was warm and buttery. Quite rich.
Pancake with eggs and bacon ... cooked as I had requested it
Omelette ... was a good, but a lil bit much on the cheese. (They did offer to make another one. But we were starving. So we passed on the offer.)

Overall, food was quite nice, and reminds me of home cooked american breakfast. :)
The service was a bit on the slow side, but that one lady took quite good care of us once she realised we have yet to be assisted. She took our order, and served it as well.

If you like hearty American home made breakfast feel ... arrive early at The Farmhouse. They are worth giving a go! ^_^

::TO DATE::
We have been back several times since February 2013. We still enjoy their grub!"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 or 3 times and it has pretty good breakfast and lunch food.  The place always has a long line waiting outside and I just don't get why.  Its good but not good enough to wait 30 minutes for when there are so many other options that are just as good within walking distance.  I guess I just don't get why so many people wait so long for it."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good.  Their coleslaw is fantastic, crisp and sweet and light with little bits of broccoli in it.  
Now for the rest.  I went with two friends and my two children, one of which uses a high chair.  We walked in on a Monday afternoon and the place was about half full.  A waitress motioned from the back for us to sit at a round table so we did, picking up our own menus on the way.  And then we sat.  And sat.  My son squirmed around on my lap but I had nowhere to put him.  I watched two different waitresses walk by us repeatedly, even cleaning tables but not making eye contact. I finally flagged one down and she came over and said, \"You've been helped right?\"  We said no and she turned around and left.  A few minutes later a different waitress comes up, tells us we want coffee and seems put out when we ask for something else and sighs when I say I need a high chair.  5 more minutes go by and we get half the drinks.  Then a few minutes later the rest.  I can put up with lackluster service as long as the food is good and I had heard great things about this place so I held on to my patience.  I ordered the Long John with mushrooms.  Well, I can tell you that if I ever run out of hockey pucks for my local team, I know where to go.  It was almost inedible.  Dry, tough overcooked ground beef patty with a smattering of tasteless mushrooms topped with half melted cheese.  I actually asked for a side of ranch so I could dip it in that to make it moist enough to eat.  The waitress never asked how the food was, and we never saw her again after she ran my credit card.  
I hope that this was just an off day but really the second star is only because of the coleslaw.  I will probably try it again if someone else wants to go, but overall not a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Not trying to be a totally rump about this but...uhhh....this place is super overrated. We waited a little bit to go stuff our gizzards which is normal and whatever but the food tasted like any normal breakfast Ive ever had. I mean i know its a Gilbert staple or whatever but id rather just creep right on over to IHOP to get the same if not better grub. The staff was super nice and im not taking anything away from them but.....i mean....the food.....cmon huns. People acting like this place is the first ever Budweiser Restaurant. get outta here."}
{"text":"Very Good Food! Southern style cooking, big portions, and it all tastes amazing. Great location but the place is pretty small. It has a lot of charm but you get packed in because so many people want to eat here and there is always a wait. Wish they could expand some more."}
{"text":"One of my  favorite  local breakfast  joints to eat at. Never had a bad meal or poor service. Small  and cozy environment.  Nestled off the main road before all the hustle  and bustle.  Great  place, especially in cooler months to sit on patio. Love taking my out of town friends here."}
{"text":"3 words. De-Lish-Ous. Ok I cheated there.  Great breakfast joint, the wait wasn't too bad on a Sunday AM.  I had waffles and fresh fruit which were more than enough to get my day started."}
{"text":"Great food so be prepared for a wait at lunch and on the weekends.  The cinnamon bun is HUGE so get one to share with the table, tons of frosting on top and hot....yumm.  Everything is delicious and they have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"A place you really Must Try! Great food, superb service, I love it ! Would go more often if I could, but I always enjoy it when I can make it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful cinnamon rolls, bread basket and omelettes. You can't go wrong here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Another place so overrated that I wonder what kind of taste people must have to rate these so highly. I understand that food is generally subjective, but not so much that you can't differentiate between bad and horrible. I'll help you, this place is bad. 

The service is so poor I don't know how I didn't eat my paper napkin. It was so slow that I almost walked out. 

The food is what you'd cook at home if you weren't lazy, but you are so you come here. And pay a hefty price for your laziness. Guilty as charged. 

Except your food is better because you get it when you want it, not when they remember to put your order in. The waitress didn't write my order down (next time I'm insisting!) and it came out crazy late and without something I'd added. Grrr.

By the time I'd finished eating I knew that I'd never be back. And I won't."}
{"text":"A very tasty place for breakfast.  I strenuously object to any place that doesn't serve hash browns, but really that's my only complaint.  They have a ton of different omelets/scrambles (you choose) and you can make your own.  Example: spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese.  As a scramble.  With salsa.  The coffee is good (I hear from my wife) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat.  Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10.  

It is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure.  You'll be waiting outside.  

They grill their wheat toast-solid."}
{"text":"Great prices!!!  Outstanding service!!! Large portions!! Homemade from scratch food!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best breakfast places in town, as evidenced by the long lines outside. The place next door, liberty market is good too, but the Farmhouse is worth the wait if youre craving breakfast. The decor inside is very rustic and comfy. We split an omelet and pancakes. I also ordered a side of bacon! The portions were huge! We could barely finish our food! Everything tasted soo good, I was especially pleased with the bacon! It was perfectly thick and crispy!"}
{"text":"After reading a lot of reviews on Yelp, my hubby and I decided to come here and we're very happy we did. I ordered buttermilk pancakes with a side of potatoes and he ordered the chorizo omelette. We also ordered the cinnamon bun and the cinnamon lattes. Everything was delicious. The sizes were generous and it wasn't overpriced at all. It was about $30 for everything, which is awesome! We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the food has always been very good. When you arrive if it's busy you sign up outside and wait to be called. We have never waited very long to be seated. The staff is very attentive and friendly. Just love the staff. I have one question: what happened to the food?  My biscuits & gravy was cold and did not taste good.  Normally it is wonderful but this time it had some strange favors in it. Actually it was floury and somewhat bland. Not good. The rest of the group said their food was just ok.   This is rare for this place. Don't know if they have changed cooks but something needs to be. Fixed. The people at the next table sent one of dishes back also. Please fix it. Of course we will be back. This is just a minor setback."}
{"text":"Very generous portions. Good if a bit bland sausage biscuits and gravy.  In my opinion the savory foods are where its at, the baked goods aren't their forte.  Biscuits were bland and too doughy, almost undercooked. And I was a bit disappointed in the cinnamon bun.  I'm expecting a big fluffy yeasty cinnamony, buttery, frostingly good chewy baked good, but this was more of a cinnamon biscuit ring.   Great service though.  It's a good neighborhood joint and the history of the place is very cool."}
{"text":"What a lovely place.  It is a green spot in ab otherwise beige landscape.  The food was fresh and tasty.  I had a kale and quinoa salad with a nice poppy seed dressing.  The Intrepid Eater had a turkey and avocado sandwich on a tasty seeded bread.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that the staff  were not really on the ball.  They assume you have been there before and know the system."}
{"text":"Yummy & fresh food with excellent service!! My only wish is that they had an indoor waiting area or misters out front for the hot sunny days, but seriously delicious food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Other than the long wait, which is a pretty good sign, this place is great! Its small, upbeat and the staff are courteous and fast. Our food came out quickly and I tried both the green chili omelet that my husband ordered as well as the green chili scramble. The house bread is yummy, and I'm not a bread lover. Get the hibiscus, its yummy!"}
{"text":"I have ate there a few times, we are usually a group of 6 or 8, very little space for groups. Always had to wait 15 minutes or so to be seated. We only ate breakfast there , the service was great, prices a little high, the fried potatoes were tasteless.
We won't probably never go back, to many better places for breakfast nearby."}
{"text":"Zombie-like service, food mediocre. Meh."}
{"text":"Don't come here during hot summer months. You'll be stuck waiting outside along the streets cape. They didn't bother to turn on misters or leave water outside until someone had to ask about 20 mins in from us waiting. DONT come here if you have a baby or child during busy hours. They will get cranky waiting. No side waiting area. And there really isn't instructions on how to get in line for a table. So make sure you sign up on the clipboard. We're still waiting as I write this review. Hopefully the food is better than the wait. I won't be coming back until winter. Not worth the summer wait and I haven't tried the food yet. NOT BABY FRIENDLY! No changing tables in restrooms."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews, we decided to try it for a Saturday midmorning breakfast.  Yes, the line was fairly long but we waited.  Very disappointed!  The omelet was dry and hard, very little flavor.  The sliced breakfast potatoes were overdone and hard.  Biscuits and gravy were ok.  Service was good.  Would not eat there again.  Had a Village Inn breakfast this morning that was tons better.  Guess we need to stick to the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about - the wait is long, the space is cramped and the food was just okay. 

I had an omlete with veggies which was good, the hubby had the special chicken fried steak with biscutis and gravy which he said was awful and my girls had pancakes with sausage and bacon. The pancakes were average but the bacon was cooked almost to the point of being charcoal - which I guess is how they cook bacon there - but it was awful and they really should let people know that this is their bacon cooking method.

The Gilbert House Restaurant up the road is WAY better - tight space and all. We have been making the rounds to try all of the local breakfast joints but we won't be making a repeat appearance here."}
{"text":"I recently at here and was very disappoint with the service and my food.

Service:  The young lady waiting on me was flirting with guy next to me the entire time.  When was asked \"What do ya want?\"  I replied \"Steak and eggs, please.\"  I never got a temp on my eggs and steak when I placed my order.  Several minutes passed and then I was asked how do I want my eggs.  Several more minutes passed and I was asked how I wanted my steak.  Several more minutes passed and I was asked what kind of toast I wanted.  I almost had to argue with the young lady to get whole wheat toast.  She then told the guy next to (one of Gilbert's finest, from what I gathered), \"this is why I don't serve people\".  As if to indicate I was being hard to deal with.

The food:  I ordered my steak medium and it came out well done.  I was never asked how it was, even though the gentlemen next to me was checked on several times throughout his meal.  

I still tipped over 20%, however it was not deserved.  I used to be a server/bartender myself so I know how it goes.  However, I would have felt bad, personally if I delivered that poor of service to any of my guests."}
{"text":"Ok i have certain criteria for a breakfast joint. Needs to be clean of course: check! Needs to be homey:check! Can't be too big: check! Servers have to be the way i remember as a kid (and that's a big one): check! The food has to be made scratch and done well (i cooked professionally for over a decade): big check! Coffee, well you know how coffee should be: check! 

I could probably keep going but the point is, NEW FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE. And they open at 6 everyday! This could be dangerous.  I don't know if i can afford to go out to breakfast every day. . ."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for ages buts always so busy and I can see why. There was a minimal wait even for a Tuesday around 9:30. I had a bacon,spinach,tomato, cheese omelet that was excellent. The side potatoes were done perfectly with just the right crispy. They were well seasoned and cut to just the righ thickness.  My husband had the French toast which were four halves that upon first look might be a little heavy, but after tasting they were as light as heaven.  The servers were very kind and attentive and worked very well with each other.  I can't wait to go back. I want the French toast with strawberries."}
{"text":"OK....This is THE PLACE to eat breakfast on a Sunday morning in Gilbert!! food is awesome and service is fast and friendly.... expect a wait, but it's MORE than worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time was a couple years ago. It was pretty good. We decided to go for our anniversary. Monday morning, only 4 tables of customers. Nothing special about this restaurant. We asked the waitress if there were breakfasts with biscuits and gravy. She said no, you need to order the side, which was $5. Breakfast was overcooked, toast was burnt, nothing special about the French toast. $30 for two...not worth it. Outside...big specials sign showing exactly what I ordered with biscuits and gravy, just $5 cheaper. Biscuits were too soft, gravy had no flavor. I'm not sorry I accidentally left my leftovers."}
{"text":"This was another restaurant my sister in law raves about. But I have to tell you I wasn't that impressed. It was a decent breakfast. But nothing special. And it was a little pricey too. A lot of the omelets were over $11 each. And if you want to share, they charge you an additional $3. 
I was also disappointed there wasn't a kids menu. I only saw 1 kids item on the menu - kids Mickey pancakes. 
My pancakes were just ok. Not the best I've ever had. There are other restaurants in downtown Gilbert I would rather frequent for breakfast than this."}
{"text":"The Chipped Beef on Toast was delicious!  Regardless of the day, the Farmhouse is always busy, so be prepared to wait. Thank goodness for the awning and the misters!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of breakfast food...but this place could change my mind.  When we walked up, there were a bunch of people outside, we thought the wait would be forever, but it actually went rather quickly.  Once inside, its very simple, I liked that...after, its supposed to be an old farmhouse.  My wife had an omelet which she said was very good.  We split the bread basket, the cinnamon roll was very good, the biscuits were amazing, and I probably would have enjoyed the muffin more if it we rent for the poppy seeds.  I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy.  Again, the biscuits, very tasty...I got the chipped beef gravy, good, I think next time I will order the sausage, but the gravy itself was so good, it didn't need any meat at all.  Our waitress was great, very friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I used to come here all the time, until I came with my kids.  Since they don't have a kids menu, I would of thought that the waitress would split a reg breakfast for my two little ones, since she told me that, she would figure something out for them. She came out with three big size plates, my kids are 3,7.  What bothered me is the check was $47.00, and that ruined my day with them, I couldn't afford to do anything else. I will not be coming back, instead I go to black bear diner now, their prizes are great, and the food I can say is better than the farmhouse."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was wonderful!  Small place, busy, but the wait wasn't long at all.  We got there around 11:30 on a Sunday and only waited about 5 minutes. I ordered Oatmeal and fruit and my husband got a Denver Omelette..... all very delicious!  Serving size is big too!  Well worth it and the prices are great! Our bill was $21 for all that food and we each got juice."}
{"text":"I've eaten so many times at this restaurant that I couldn't possibly count them all.  So much so that I've gotten to know most of the wait staff, and I treasure them all as they are just the warmest, nicest people in Gilbert, for sure!  But, let's talk food!  It's simply the best!  Whether it's simple eggs and bacon, one of their incredible omelets, their very yummy biscuits and gravy, or their to-die-for country fried steak, there simply is no place better -- and we who live in Gilbert are so lucky to have this restaurant in our own backyard!  5 stars isn't enough...I give them 10!  Seriously.  The food is great...and, if there's a wait outside (as there often is on weekends), it's definitely worth the wait.  Oh, the number of times I've waited.  Worth it every time...never a non-top-of-the-line breakfast served here.  I wish I could buy stock in the place!  Okay, I'll stop.  But, I could keep going...I could!  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for an impromptu visit as we were in the area.  I have seen Gilbert grow up; however the farmhouse has maintained its small town charm- sort of.  Let me first begin by saying that we were early enough to be seated right away which was luck given how many people were waiting when we left.  The place is cozy but it leaves something to be desired by way of cleanliness.  Spilled coffee on the walls and stained baseboards = my view during breakfast.  Our service was excellent.  Waitress was attentive but failed to mention during our breakfast that they charge for chocolate milk refills.  We were 2 adults and a child and our bill was $37.  In my opinion, that is steep for what you get.  I had the chicken fried steak which should be renamed as teeth catching grizzle steak. It was full of small bone like fragments of which I thought I might lose a tooth.  It turned my stomach.  My son got the short stack which is 2 pancakes for $6 and it came with a complimentary eyelash. He found it, we didn't. I am reasonably confident we will NOT be back. 3 stars is a little bit of a stretch but I am feeling whimsical ."}
{"text":"Was at the nearby farmer's market so decided to stop here for breakfast.  The hordes of people coming here do it for a reason - the food is plentiful with generous portions, fast, cheap, friendly atmosphere, and GOOD. Green chili and pork omelet did not disappoint. DEFINITELY will be back if we can fight of the rest of the crowd."}
{"text":"Any time my boyfriend and I are in the mood for a great breakfast Farm house is the only place we go. Period! portions are huge, service is always friendly, and food is alway wonderful!!! If  you havent tried it you must."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a late breakfast today and I'm so glad I did. I got one of their omelets and it turned out to be the best restaurant omelet I've ever had! The service was great as well, the waitress was attentive and personable. I'll becoming back to try out some different meals and I'll be recommending it to my friends! If you need a delicious, hearty breakfast, brunch, or lunch, you won't find a better spot!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! It was served quickly, hot and correct. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think people are overly impressed with the down home, small town feel of this place. That was OK, don't get me wrong, but at the end of the day I'm there to eat. And my salad just wasn't THAT great. My tomato juice was not cold, and my waitress was only SORT of cute. Ha, yes, I'm being sarcastic. But nonetheless the food was decent, not GREAT. I do want to support the fact that this is a locally owned business so I don't want to just give it three stars, but it probably deserved it. I tried the sandwiches my dining mates had and still wasn't overly impressed. The cob salad seemed OK, mine had fruit in it which I'm not a huge fan of. I say if you're older, like to take things slow, and eat breakfast all day, then this is your place."}
{"text":"ok, so i have only been here one time.  i ordered the chicken fried steak topped with biscuits and gravy and an over medium egg.  it was the day's special and i was super stoked to start the grubbing.  our server came right away and filled up our coffee.  the staff was excellent.  anyways..back to the food.  my eyes opened very big to the sight of what i thought was going to be the best breakfast ever. after the first bite...i sadly realized that i made a bad decision.  the chicken fried steak reminded me of the stuff you got in your elementary school cafeteria...the biscuits were far from home made and the gravy had a very odd flavor.  i was super bummed and so was my fiance.  a total let down.  now on to the egg. that little thing was great!  and the coffee was perfect too.
i do plan on trying this place one more time due to all the great reviews it has received. don't get me wrong...i want to like this place...but i can't just right now."}
{"text":"I'm such a breakfast person. It's truly my favorite meal of the day, so when i finally got an opportunity to try The Farmhouse I was thrilled. 

It was a bit of a wait on Saturday morning so plan for that but once you sit down you realize you are in for a quaint old school farm style breakfast. 

We both got omelettes and they did not disappoint.  On mine; I missed the note about asking for your omelette to be scrambled but it was still delish.  Boy that scrambled one looked amazing though.  Will definitely remember that for next time. And i highly recommend getting sour cream in your omelette.... brings it to another level :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge breakfast person, but my girlfriend  was in the mood so we wanted decided to try a new place. First of all, if you love to wait, this place is your place. Around 10:30am/Sat, the wait is about 35 minutes and you cannot make reservations here. So we waited and waited with little children running all around running into things. It's not that I don't like children, I just prefer them to be well mannered...so I also like to get off topic.

After being seated, I ordered the Reuben sandwich and she got eggs with veggies. The portions are large, we weren't able to finish it all - but I'm not sure if that is because there was so much food or if it was because it wasn't that tasty. The eggs were average and the sandwich was average. The time invested wasn't worth the food reaped. Don't get me wrong, I would choose this place over a Denny's anyday, but I think much of the hype comes from the fact that this place always has a long line. \"If there is always a wait, ipso facto the food must be great.\" 

The reason there is always a long line outside is because the restaurant is small. I would much rather have walked next door to Liberty Market. Liberty Market is always packed, but usually there is not much of a wait because there is so much seating available! I won't make this review about how great Liberty Market is, but since they are right next door, it is important to take each one into account. 

We finished up with their homemade cinnamon bun - which was actually super gooey and tasty. Too gooey for my gf's pleasure, but I was perfectly happy to use it to cover up the taste of my aforementioned sandwich. Perfect amount of sweet and just the right amount of warmth.

When this place gets busy, it seems like the waiters do forget about you. I think our table was only visited once after our orders were taken. I just wanted a damn water refill and never got it.

All in all, average breakfast spot. If you're hungry, it's not worth the wait. If you wanna try a new place, give it a shot - every place deserves at least one chance. Except for Denny's - there is no need for you to ever go there."}
{"text":"Checked out The Farmhouse over the LDW for breakfast with my family. The wait was okay although it was hot, but the mist sprays they have outside kept things cool. The pancakes are HUGE and fluffy. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and thought they were okay, nothing special. The total cost for four breakfast plates, a carafe of apple juice, and two coffees was a little over $40. 

Honestly, I don't know if I would wait to eat here again, especially if it is 105 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Yes, there's a wait. If you don't want to wait, then choose another restaurant. We wandered around the area, periodically checking back in which made the wait pleasant. 

My husband who IS the Burger Miester gave the burger a 5/5. Very rare rating!
Pancakes-fluffy but flavor wasn't anything unique (Gilbert House keeps the pancake crown). 
Fried potatoes-husband loved them and took mine home for leftovers. 
Bacon, Avocado, tomato, cheese scramble was fresh and tasty. Would order again!
Biscuits-ridiculously good. Moist, warm, flakey. YUM!
Cinnamon Roll- table consensus was it's ok. Little bit of a lemon flavor? We wouldn't order it again. 
Server was very friendly and good. Decor is old time charm."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and years I always told myself that breakfast is not something worth waiting on with exception of this place and this place only their scrambles and omelets are absolutely to die for the coffee is great and the service is always top notch if you're looking for a nice home-cooked style meal with a smile I highly suggest The Farmhouse in their green chile pork weekend special scramble is to die for"}
{"text":"Just a great place to go!  The food is consistently good, the atmosphere relaxed and the serving team is always fast and has a smile  for you.  It's the closest thing to a local 'Cheers' i have found.  I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went back today (2nd time this week). I added that 5th star. I had an omelette with home fries and upgraded the bread to a biscuit with gravy. It wasn't cheap, but wow! I am in love. 

What a great little place! I'm a breakfast snob, and 4 stars is a high mark in my book! 

I had the biscuits and gravy and it was top notch! I always like to see an option to pair the B&G with some eggs and potatoes without having to a la carte yourself into a $15 meal.  But I was told after the fact that I could sub toast for a half order on another menu item. That is a good solution, I just didn't learn about it early enough. 

Wife had an omelette that was LOADED with bacon and cheese! Well done on the quantity of that bacon! It looked delicious...she wouldn't share. 

Also had a Mickey cake hit the table and it was a hit. I tried that and was floored. Really good pancake! 

We managed to dodge a wait, but don't bank on that. I've seen the line that can form for their small dining room, and it is TINY!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food and friendly service.  The wait is often 20-30min weekend mornings but it is without a doubt worth it."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  The people are really great too!  They serve lunch but I always come for breakfast."}
{"text":"We came here because it got good reviews and we were not disappointed! Had a minor issue that was quickly corrected. The customer service was awesome and we will definitely be going back. The ham was amazing, not too salty. The French toast was nice and fluffy too."}
{"text":"I ate the turkey melt with potato salad...yummmmmmy!! Very quaint nice place In downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a cobb salad and my husband had a santa fe omelet.  We both loved the food, the service and ambiance was just wonderful. There is indoor and outdoor dining and both are immaculately clean. We ended with a piece of apple/rhubarb pie which was to die for.  This will be our new go to restaurant.  The owner, Susan, came out and personally talked to us.  She is an absolute delight.  We would highly recommend a meal here.  They are open for breakfast and brunch only."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!!! It was recommended to eat here from people who live here!! A local joint with history and it is homemade!! It was also recommended to the homemade cinnamon roll and I am we took that suggestion!!!

They even have a huge mickey mouse pancake for kids and to add even more joy they draw a smiley face with whipped cream! 

Great environment! Amazing staff!! Excellent food!! Prices are great too! 

Do yourself a favor and eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was about 10 or so. At that time we lived way over in arrowhead. Mom and I both thought the drive to be worthwhile. Now my boyfriend and I try and make it at least once a month. Also this is my go to place to take friends or family who don't live near here. (They always leave impressed) anyway-
 The best values on the menu have got to be the omelets! (Or scrambles, if that's your thing) They are massive and packed to the brim with your favorite fillings (I get the #20 but I sub the tomatoes out for shrooms and my bf gets the #21) 
Also, I don't care if you love rye or sourdough or whatever, you MUST try their wheat french bread. 
 Clearly, I am crazy about this place. However I couldn't give a full five stars because the home fry portions the last several visits were about half of what they used to be. Wow, how terrible, right? They're still delicious!  
  -Lifetime Customer"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast best in Phoenix!!! I can't say one bad thing about it!!! Great food great people!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite place for breakfast in AZ. I always get the #10 omelet (bacon, potato, green onion, sour cream, and cheese) with no potato add avocado. Sooooo gooooood. This is one of the few places I order omelets because they are really good. The omelets are always light and fluffy, their home fries are really good and different from any others I have had, and their toast is amazing. They toast a french wheat baquette which takes toast to a whole other level! The husband usually gets the green chili pork omelet which is a special on the weekends. He absolutely loves it and I will admit that it is pretty dam tasty! Other things we have tried: cinnamon roll was huge and lovely, chicken fried steak and eggs which is a special on the weekend, and biscuits and gravy which is huge and the gravy definately taste homeade. The prices are good and the service is always good with a really friendly staff. I never have to wait for my drink to be refilled and the food comes out pretty quick. The only thing you will be waiting for is a table. Unfortunately, this place has a huge following of people that love it but the restaurant itself is tiny. Ive seen master bedrooms larger than this place!!! Expect to wait at least a half hour if you come here during normal breakfast hours. Ive noticed if you sleep a little later though and come around 11:30 or 12, its not nearly as crowded. Also, this place does not have indoor waiting. You put your name on a list outside and you wait outside. There is shade but during the summer months, it obviously gets hot. So be prepared for that. If you can handle the wait, you will definately agree that this place is the best little diner for breakfast in AZ!"}
{"text":"Legitness.
If you're an omelette guy like me, this is THE BEST place in Gilbert.
It's a small place, so expect a little bit of a wait if you come early morning on any day.  WORTH THE WAIT. I came on my birthday and got a free cinnamon roll for dessert!!  YEAH!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place. It's tiny and popular so you may have to wait, but I think it's worth it. The service is great and the food is good home style cooking. Try the whole wheat french bread toast with honey on it, it's pure amazingness!"}
{"text":"This a cute little place in Gilbert. It's not really made to move around in a wheelchair but we made it ok. We started off with coffee which was really good. My friend and I shared the French toast and a scramble. The French toast wasn't anything special but it was good and well presented. The scramble in the other hand was really good and I would def order it again if I were to come back.  The home potatoes were delishhhhhh!"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here before heading out to the Grand Canyon on recommendation from my cousin who lives locally. My husband and I split a veggie scramble with hash browns and corn tortillas and shared a large fresh fruit bowl. We really enjoyed the scramble and it was plenty for us with the fruit bowl. The service was great and staff was very friendly. Not crowded on Monday morning but I guess they get busy on the weekend as most really good breakfast places do. We hope to come here again on future visits."}
{"text":"Good omelets. Good baked dessert pastries. I like their home fries the best."}
{"text":"It was decent. Very small. Like every small town restaurant I have ever eaten at in the Midwest. Basic Food. Nothing to write home about. I have no idea anybody would wait in line outside to go into this place. I will go back but if I had to wait even three minutes to get in I wouldn't go. Denny's or Village Inn is just  as good."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  We got up early the Sunday before Labor Day (7am) and took advantage of no wait!  Started with a cinnamon roll - you'll never order one in a mall after having one of theirs.  Delicious!   I chose the two eggs with home fries & an English muffin - very good.  Date chose one of the specials - chicken fried steak with eggs, and home fries.  There were biscuits under the gravy which was a surprise (he didn't remember reading that on the sign).  The only negative was the steak didn't seem to have any flavor - the breading was very bland.  The gravy was only flavor discernible.    

The place filled up shortly after we sat.  Crowded, I don't mind but on that date several families with small kids were seated around us.  The ceilings are super high so the acoustics carry - very hard to have a convo amid the shrieking of the child to our right.  The family was too busy talking to pay any notice to the tables around them.  We finished up and headed to Postino's for a quieter convo over coffee."}
{"text":"Still great even after the move to downtown Gilbert from the old farm house.  The food is very much like farm fresh breakfast you would find in the mid west."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. But you have to time it just right or be prepared to sit streetside and wait for a table to open up. And DON'T FORGET TO SIGN IN AT THE NOTEPAD OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR.  If you even step inside to see what the wait might be like, I assure you 3 more groups will sign in before you. The food here is very good. Their bacon and omelettes are the best. So are their cinnamon rolls. The fresh fruit is sometimes hit or miss depending on the time of year. Very cute intimate atmosphere and the servers are always friendly, even when there's a packed house."}
{"text":"I don't usually go out for breakfast (would rather sleep in if I have the choice) but hubby and I met his mother here for breakfast last week, and I was glad I got out of bed for it.

Arrived at about 9:30am and got a table right away.  Service was quick and friendly.

I ordered an omelet with green onions, green chili, salsa and cheese.  It was quite tasty but it almost had TOO much stuff in it!  Really - it had so much chili, salsa, etc, that I barely tasted the egg!  Plus for some, negative for others perhaps?  I liked it but also wouldn't have minded a little less \"stuff\" in the omelet.

Hubby and mother-in-law both loved their food.  We all shared a cinnamon roll and OH-MY-GOSH was it delicious!  I pretty much let them have a taste then devoured the rest of it myself.  If you go here, you MUST get the cinnamon roll.  The cream cheese frosting is unbelievable.  

All in all I can't wait to go back here.  I will likely try a different omelet next time and I will DEFINITELY order the cinnamon roll again.  My mouth is watering already..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 10 years. I love their breakfast sandwich on sourdough, the blueberry pancakes and omelettes are pretty amazing as well. 
Word to the wise get here early!

The breakfast sandwich always makes me think of the movie Spanglish, where the chef makes this very sandwich and then has to wait out an argument before the first bite. So mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere outside, inside was very crowded. The food was missing something and the hot drinks were served cold. Liberty Market is a much better bet for brunch."}
{"text":"So I finally decided to try the Farmhouse Restaurant in Gilbert since so many people rave about it. Their biscuits and gravy come without eggs, there's barely any sausage in the actual sauce and the pepper isn't fine so I keep getting hot spots as I eat it. I guess it's better than the overbearing taste of flour. 
Also, the coffee tastes like its grains have been recycled. I did however ask for more since the meal is so crappy.  Something to keep me busy while my toddler is eating (yes, I'm sitting in the restaurant as I type this)..... which brings me to my next point. His eggs and bacon taste ok. Can't really screw that up since it doesn't require much skill. The homemade pancakes however, taste like PURE flour. Took a bite and spit it out. I feel bad for my kid having to eat them but at least I ordered chocolate chips to be added so it's keeping him happy. 
The OJ tastes like the frozen Minute Maid crap you get in the Walmart freezer section. 
The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because of the friendly waitress and decor.


!!!!!!Update!!!!! ---- As I was getting ready to leave (only after Paying and tipping, of course) an elderly woman approached me and asked: Did you do something on Yelp? 
Awkwardly I say: Yes, I left a review. 
Woman: You know, I get it straight to my phone (shows me phone). 
Me: Ok...... 
Woman: These reviews can really knock us down. 
Me: I reviewed my experience. 
Woman: The chef used a coarser pepper. 
Me: Ok..... 
Woman: These reviews come to my phone and people see them. 
Me (slightly annoyed): I spoke to my experience. 
Woman: Is there something we can do to make your experience better?
Me: No, we won't be back. Have a great day. 

Here is a word of advice to the woman who approached me today: 

1) ALWAYS introduce yourself. 

2) Don't wait for people to write reviews in order for you to know how they feel. Look at the face of your customers. Walk around your restaurant. Greet people, ask them how they're doing. 

3) Be active in your kitchen. Interact with your chef. Taste the food. Know exactly what your patrons are eating. 

4) Never put an unhappy customer in an awkward position by asking if there's anything you can do to help. Have a solution ready. 

This experience leads me to wonder just how true these yelp reviews really are. By far the most awkward experience I've ever had.
I now give this place 1 star."}
{"text":"Amazing Saturday morning breakfast here! My parents and I were visiting for the weekend and I found this place on yelp. Excellent choice, thank you yelp! We had the green Chile scramble with avocado and it did not disappoint! Also, the bloody beers were delicious! Whenever you're in Downtown Gilbert this is a great place to fill your tummy."}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast ever!! I swear they have someone's grandmother cooking breakfast. When I get homesick, have out of town guests, or just need to remember what eating at my grandma's table was like I come here. The best biscuits. They are so close to the ones my grandma used to make it is scary. The cinnamon rolls are soft, sweet, gooey and you can't just eat one bite. I've been coming here since 2001 and it has never failed to meet and exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Pretty good staple breakfast items. This was my first visit. I ordered a chorizo, green chili and cheese scramble, with a pancake on the side and the homestyle potatoes. Everything I had was good and hearty. Nothing stood out to me as \"best I've ever had\" though. Nothing wowed me, so to speak, but everything was good. A solid addition to my breakfast rotation in the area."}
{"text":"They have the best Ruben sandwich I have ever tasted!  My husband had  biscuits and gravy and claimed they were the best.  We will definitely be returning to the Farmhouse."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and there is always a line outside. Solid food, but because the restaurant is small (part of its charm, I suppose) you feel like you are on top of each other. If you're looking to be able to have a conversation during breakfast, I would try somewhere else. If you're more concerned about the food and fast service, then head on over and be prepared to wait a bit"}
{"text":"I'm not really a breakfast person. In fact, I'd rather have a simple bowl of cereal than a whole spread with all the usuals.

So when I go out for breakfast with the friends who love it, there'd better be some lunch-like selections and the breakfast had better be freaking good. And better than what I could do at home.

Farmhouse was good, solid, hearty fare. I had the chicken-fried steak (only available on weekends) which was as tasty as any I'd had in the Midwest/South. And I could never make it as good as this. We also ordered a cinnamon roll since it apparently was all the rage but it didn't live up to the hype. Decent, but typical. In fact, a little too sweet for my taste. The icing killed everything for me.

Don't be discouraged by the line. It moves relatively quick. And anyway, there isn't a place in this State I've been to where a good weekend breakfast doesn't involve a wait."}
{"text":"Tried Farmhouse for the first time yesterday! Excellent service! We arrived around 8:00am, we got a table right away. We were served delicious coffee right away! I ordered a ham and cheese omelette, mom ordered buttermilk pancakes with bacon and eggs. Both delicious, forget chain restaurants this place it homey and yummy!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast we've found in town so far, and worth the wait... because there always is one. Service is good.... coffee could be a little warmer but overall everything that I have had here has been amazing. We always bring out of town guests here, and they always rave about it."}
{"text":"We have been here a zillion times since my first review a few years ago and love the place more than ever.  The food is always good, tasty, and big portions.  We've gotten to know all of the servers and they are all attentive, warm, and good at what they do.  The place makes you feel at home and comfortable.  It's next door to Liberty Market and I'm always surprised that people walk over to Farmhouse, see there is a 10-15 minute wait, and impatiently just go to Liberty.  Look, I've been to Liberty probably 3 or 4 times and its good but stopped going after there was a nice long hair in the eggs. Farmhouse is a nice small family owned business and the food is great.  I usually either get eggs over medium, half bacon and sausage, fruit, crispy hashbrowns, and coffee OR an omelet with turkey, green onion, tomato, mushrooms, and avocado.  Both awesome.  The French dip is great and the daily specials are all excellent.  We've tried most of the menu and love it all.  The chili is very good also.  As far as desserts, try the cakes they have available week to week.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.  When you show up there will almost certainly be a line.  But it's worth the wait.  They take the most boring meal of the day (breakfast) and make it exciting.  I had the green chile pork omelet.  The flavors were bold.  It was wonderful.

And I don't really like breakfast.

The others in our party enjoyed their food also.

The portions are generous, and the prices reasonable.  I will almost certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Unimaginative, uninspired, and outdated. I don't think the menu has changed since the 80,s. Boring and bland. Owners should get out more and see what their competition is doing. Thoroughly unimpressed and won't return. Breakfast wasn't worth $22.00 for one person. Although if you're looking for a tasteless omelette the size of a football and some unseasoned potatoes you may like this place. You will however have to wait for a table to enjoy your football omelette."}
{"text":"Excellent for omelettes & tasty pancakes! Enjoyed everything. Bit of a wait so be patient it's worth it."}
{"text":"One of Gilbert's Treasures. 
The Farmhouse is the oldest restaurant in Downtown Gilbert going back to when Gilbert was a small town close to 30years!      It is always busy for a Reason... The food is Excellent and the Customer Service is simply Amazing. It is quaint and has that genuine Country Feeling. 
     Millie always uses FRESH ingredients and has maintained high standards of quality from the very begining Her dishes are always unique and very tasty- Portions are generous. The homemade Cinnamon Rolls are the signature tradition.
    The Farmhouse is a wonderful place to escape the chaotic world."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Loved every part of my meal, huge portions, great drinks, and fairly priced. Its become the new place I like to show friends that visit from out of town. The biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge line I always see when I drive by but I went on a Sunday morning and there wasn't even a wait. Just have to pick the right days I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome Location Great Breakfast Drinks (Snooze Drink) great Pancakes cool atmosphere service is excellent Lil bit of a Wait but Worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pops. Cute farm type decorations. reminds me of my Grandma's house. It does get busy quick and the wait is long. I would love to say that the wait is worth it. The portions are big but the food reminds me of something I would just pick up at Denny's or Ihop. I was not impressed with the flavors. the Potatoes were good but that is as far as I can get with taste."}
{"text":"Come Hungry!  This is straight up country style good home cooking, and that means massive portions.  Located and downtown Gilbert and has that home country atmosphere (feels like mom is cooking for you).  Their omelets and home fries are the way to go and you cannot mess that up with there wide selection.  If you have a sweet tooth though you have to get there cinnamon roll!  It is large and in charge.  This gooey, soft, break apart roll is covered in cream cheese frosting.  So get that sugar high and go to Farmhouse!

BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"Extremely solid option in downtown Gilbert.  It is the opposite of the other main breakfast location a couple of doors down.  Home style cooking where everything on the menu seems a cut above the norm.  Potions are on massive.  Good luck finishing.  Really good locale joint.  Hit them up."}
{"text":"Little fun place. ..Quite the wait on a Sunday but moved quickly and even a covered area to wait. Seating inside was minimal but staff hustling around moving the tables quickly..but we never felt rushed. 

Our party ordered several scrambles & chicken fried steak. My husband very happy with the CBS, crispy crust, not greasy at at all. He commented (which he normally doesn't!) That finally someone \"got over medium eggs right\"...scramble delicious with thick chunks of bacon and fresh basil good  (my choice)\"slab\" of toast buttered all the way around...All around pleasing and will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast joints! Their potatoes are the best! I've had the biscuits and gravy, omelets, and array of other things on their menu and everything is delicious. The coffee is great, so if you're looking for a pick-me-up it is definitely the way to go! It is a smaller restaurant with limited seating so if you don't want to wait make sure you come early."}
{"text":"The food and coffee are both good.  Most other places nearby have good food, but bad coffee.  Or they have good coffee, but bad food.  The wait for a table here is long.  Waiting area is on a busy street with nothing to prevent children from accidentally walking right out into traffic."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse was another found on Yelp experience for us. We have a late brunch here and found it to be a good place.

Food was good
Service was good
Prices were not too high

Cool little house turned into a eatery..."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at this restaurant this morning (6/6/08) and it was outstanding.  Their breakfast oatmeal, served with raisins, brown sugar, and milk, is some of the best I've ever tasted, so much so that I asked the waitress what kind of oatmeal they used (Quaker Slow Oats is what was explained to me).  The menu lists homemade muffins so I asked what the muffin of the day was and it turned out to be one of my favorites, blueberry.  I ordered the muffin and it was served piping hot with a few pats of butter.  It was so hot that I was compelled to melt butter over it, something I rarely do.  The muffin was delicious and not too sweet like so many you get at chain restaurants or convenience stores.  The coffee was excellent, the service friendly without being too friendly, and the restaurant itself was very clean and nicely, if simply, appointed.  I will eat here again and bring my family."}
{"text":"Meh.  Nice spot with a convenient location.  It definitely has a local and classic feel.  The place is pretty small so plan on a wait during peak hours.  The service was great.  The food was just really ok.  Nothing wrong, nothing bad, just fine.  It was fine.  I would happily go back if someone else wanted to go, but with the options close by in growing downtown I'll probably think of other things first."}
{"text":"I have to say my experience there was just \"eh.\"  I was craving breakfast food and was looking forward to trying this place out.  It looks super cute from the outside and there is ALWAYS a huge line/wait outside so I thought for sure it would be good.  I ordered blueberry pancakes and a side of eggs.  I'm not a huge breakfast fanatic but I would think pancakes would be hard to mess up.  They were really dense and not light and fluffy, I could hardly eat them.  The other people I was with enjoyed their food and we actually did really love the yummy cinnamon roll we all shared (it's what they're \"famous\" for).  The server forgot to bring out one of the side items we ordered, so we never even got that part of our order but then it showed up on our bill.  I would probably not go back to this place, next time I'm trying Liberty Market which is literally right next door."}
{"text":"I went with 3 other friends for breakfast and we all had omelets with potatoes.... I had the cheese potatoe and sausage omelet .... the potatoes were delicious and it comes with bread in the side also... iced coffee was delicious"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this place.  I'm not a fan of hip or trendy breakfast places.  I feel like breakfast food (and Mexican) should come stacked high on a plate that would make your gym trainer cringe and make you feel so stuffed that walking out to the car seems like it should be an Olympic event.  That said this place comes close.  It's humble and it serves a plate-full of breakfast comfort food. As for the taste, I had the waffles and biscuits-and-gravy.  The waffles were pretty good, but I've easily had better.  The biscuits and gravy on the other had were very good.  Aside from homemade this was some of the best gravy I've every had.  Lol, I could probably eat that stuff as a side soup with the biscuits one the side for dipping.  So, yup, I'll be back."}
{"text":"So when i go to a breakfast house i base how good it is off their potatoes, and I've got to say The Farm House home fries are my favorite breakfast potatoes.. My new favorite place..."}
{"text":"1st visit.

Very small interior, noisy.
The floor moves when you walk on it.
While seated you get a small earthquake every time someone walks by.

The place is clean and quaintly appointed. Fitting for an eatery called The Farmhouse. We arrived at a fortunate time and had no wait for seating.

The prices are very reasonable and the portions good sized. The biscuits and gravy were quite tasty. I preferred these biscuits to the ones next door.

The remainder of the food was basic and adequate. Nothing spectacular, but better than Denny's or Ihop. I wish they had another choice of potato as the sliced home-style spuds were rather dry and tasteless. Not bad, mind you - just blah.

I would be willing to try them again. 
Perhaps other dishes would be more engaging."}
{"text":"Scrambled eggs, toast and hashbrowns.  Simple, basic and just what you want for an early morning breakfast.  It's kind of like having breakfast in someone's kitchen.  I'd recommend starting with (and sharing) one of their cinnamon rolls.  They're big and covered with frosting!  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Brought my sister here for her Birthday. Waitress was friendly. Food was tasty and BIG portions. Coffee was amazing! Thanks! Fine establishment. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Every time I've wanted to come here the line is always out the door and I never felt like waiting. Since I had the day off today my sister and I went to go try it out. The restaurant is small and you seat yourself as you walk in. Thankfully there was no wait today so we were able to sit down right away. I got the avocado, tomato and bacon omelet and my sister got the French toast with eggs and bacon. The portion size were generous , food tasted good and the service was good. However I don't think it's the best breakfast I've ever had and I'm a bit disappointed. Since there are always people waiting out the door , I had high hopes and was expecting the food to be amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to The Farmhouse Restaurant many times but seems like it's always on Wednesday for lunch. Which fortunately for me the special is Skillet Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy, a in house made roll and their homemade cole slaw. This meal is as close to homemade as possible from a restaurant.

But no matter what meal time it is I'd feel confident to order anything on the menu. Someday I'm going to have to stop in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best spot in Gilbert for breakfast but you will have to wait a while.  

This is a small charming little restaurant with really great staff.  The food is always fresh and delicious, they make really good breakfast potatoes.

 Again, be prepared for the wait."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday morning around 10-11am. Line wasn't too bad.
Waited for about 20-25mins. Limited seating, but people come in and out pretty quickly. Sign up on the waiting list outside the door**

You can park around the corner and walk here. 
Inside has a old fashioned diner feel. 
I ordered the french toast with powdered sugar on top w/ fresh fruit, $8.50 + tax + tip.

French toast was ok, nothing spectacular. Probably would not order it again. They are more known I guess for their omelets, but I did not order that as I can get omelets every day at work. 

Maybe you can come try the omelets, but I am more big on Lunch than breakfast food anyway."}
{"text":"I use to do breakfast here a lot but do their seating policy change at bar seats for breakfast that you can no longer walk in a be seated as solo patron anymore you have to wait in line now.


You lost my business forever!"}
{"text":"This place is small but knows how to make it work!! Very fast service and kind. The food was great and would go back again!"}
{"text":"I haven't seen pancakes like this since an episode of the Flintstones - definitely caveman proportions!  My son had 2 chocolate chip pancakes the size of tires.  My mom's omelette appeared to have an entire cheese wheel tucked inside, along with bacon & avocado.  I had a fruit bowl :(  But at least my coffee was good.

I will be returning when I'm not on a diet!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  I went for breakfast with my father and a friend and was bowled over by both the portion size (very large) and the flavor (off the charts).  I will definitely go back in the future.  
The only down side is that there is almost always a wait outside for seating. We went in the middle of the Arizona summer so this wasn't much of a treat but they do have misters and some seating in the shade so that helped a bit."}
{"text":"Chicken. Fried. Steak. Hands down the best I've ever, ever had. The gravy here is the best I've ever had period. You will be hard pressed to find a better place for down home breakfast in the country let alone AZ. 

What's really not to like about this place the service is awesome the food is amazing and heck even their coffee is great. If you haven't been here before, come on the weekend, early, because that's the only time you can get the chicken fried steak and eggs.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"If we are ever driving between Phoenix and Los Angeles. This is a must stop. Classic old diner type food. Nice big portions. Big menu. Big hair. Our favorite waitress always has a buckle up in her hair and so nice. 
I told my buddy I was writing a review for this place and all he could say was yum and when we taking a road trip?"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this morning. It was very good. I got the green chile, bacon, tomato and cheese scramble. I got a pancake instead of homefries for my toddler to eat. She looooved it! We also shared a cinnamon roll which was very yummy! The only thing is you have to wait a little bit because the place is tiny. But, I think it is worth the wait. We will be going back there."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place in downtown Gilbert. If there's a wait list you sign yourself in on a notebook outside. It's a strange system but I guess it works for them, just don't go inside and ask about the wait. My friend did that (they didn't know about the sign yourself in system) and she got scolded. 

The food was good. The service was ok, nothing special. I had an omelette with bacon, ham, cheese, and mushrooms. I liked that it was really full, too often omelettes are all egg and very little of the good stuff.  The eggs seemed a bit dry but still had a good taste. I did have to add some salt and pepper to add to the taste. 

There's not a lot of space inside. We always wondered why there always seemed to be a wait to eat there. We totally understand now after seeing how few tables are inside. 

All in all it was ok. We actually prefer the Hen House Cafe but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food, tasty coffee, nice and cozy envoirnment"}
{"text":"The wait and line can seem intimidating but I finally went to Farmhouse for Sunday brunch. The wait was 15 min, no big deal. If there's nobody outside,  write your name and party number on the clipboard outside to get your name down on the list. We went inside and the restaurant is so charming but small. Tables get turned quickly. We were seated in a booth and given a menu with one side breakfast and one side lunch. I went with the Belgian waffle and my fiance had the #18 scrambler. Food came out quickly and portions are just right. Food was decent, I thought my fiance's food was better than my waffle. Prices are good, much better than other breakfast options nearby. I would come again."}
{"text":"Ordered a Philly cheese steak special they had going,  and it was outstanding.   Home fries were great as well.   We had a little bit of a wait,  but it was totally worth it.   The only reason it doesn't get two stars is for the single person bathroom and the very cramped feel,  since its not a huge building.   I'll be back to try breakfast foods next time I am in AZ."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Cozy and cute!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. The scrambles have endless possibilities and will certainly fill you up. Very good value and my biggest complaint would be the dining room size because there is always a wait, and can often be very lengthy on the weekends."}
{"text":"This place was charming and cozy. 

Very simple menu and simple food. We had the waffle and breakfast sandwich. Nothing amazing, but very good and filling. 

The service was great and the staff was all friendly. They also use big glasses requiring less refills and waiting. They even use really cool frosted glasses for the milk. 

We will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse is a wonderful gem of a place. It's small and cozy, and filled with antiques. The location is just as quaint, in downtown Gilbert's Heritage District. BTW, the Farmhouse restaurant is not to be confused with the Farmhouse Village. There ARE restaurants there, but they are not the original Farmhouse, and not nearly as good. 

I have never had a meal here I didn't like --- from cinnamon rolls, to scrambled eggs and gravy, to a BTL sandwich and soup. They serve simple American fare, but do it right. They also --- amazingly --- have some of the same cooks and servers who have been working there for years.

The only downside I can think of is that due to it's growing popularity, there can be a line out the door. 

It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Decently priced. Food was good, coffee was good. Small business, could really use an upgrade on there furniture."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident many years ago when they were at a different location.  When I found they had moved to downtown Gilbert I was elated. 
I have never been  disappointed.  The waitresses even know my name. 
They also have great daily lunch specials.  I recommend getting there early otherwise you wait.  It is well worth the wait.  Not expensive either. $"}
{"text":"Delicious, large portions, taste/ like it was right off the farm! Tons of omelettes to pick from as well as unique toasted wheat French loaf with every breakfast. A Very home-y feeling! Highly recommend. The hashbrowns and country potatoes were both spot on!"}
{"text":"Good price for a lot of food! Omelets are huge! I couldn't finish mine for once, place gets busy because it's a small reatraunt buy it's worth the wait. Great service from the waitress too"}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast, the wait on weekends is super long but they got some misters outside so it's somewhat bearable in the heat. Arnold Palmer are the best. We come here every time we want a really good omelet and great service."}
{"text":"This is the place my sister and I went to EVERY Saturday or Sunday to enjoy sister-time and some great food!  The coffee is amazing (they use Illy) and the food is always plentiful, hot, fresh and tastes like homemade.  I love their scrambles: chile/tomato/bacon or tomato/turkey/ cheese.  They are served with a wheat french bread toast, but I get rye instead.  Try the cinnamon roll - even if just once!  Between 2 breakfasts and coffee we usually get out of there around $20.
The wait staff is friendly once you get to know them, and the atmosphere is cozy farmhouse - duh!
Now that I moved to CA, I really miss going there with my sis on weekends, and miss the coffee/food/staff!!  
They are only open until about 2 pm, so go for breakfast or lunch.  When you arrive, and there is a wait, you sign your name on a tablet, and wait to be called.  DON'T LEAVE!  It is worth the wait.  Grab a seat and watch the traffic go by.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"I love the mom and pop feel of this restaurant. The food is really yummy and if it weren't for those weekend morning long lines, I would be there more often."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try The Farmhouse for months now, and finally that day came. My oldest daughter said lets go get breakfast I'm hungry, so I took that and ran with it and off to Farmhouse we went!  It was about 9am on Sunday and we got right in, lucky us!

Right off the bat I ordered some coffee and it arrived at the table quickly.  And that's about all that did. Yes it was busy for a Sunday, but we sat for a good ten minutes before anyone took our order, but I had seen a couple that was seated well before us who hadn't order yet either. By then my coffee was gone and I saw a server walk by with a pot and I asked for some more.  But never did anyone come by to see if I needed more.  

When it was time to place our order I went with the #10, bacon, potato, green onion, sour cream & cheese omelet that came with home fries & whole grain wheat French bread toast (fancy words for wheat toast). But I do have to say, the toast was delish, the bread was so good! I love fresh baked bread.  When the omelet came I was looking for the sour cream, I didn't realize it was inside the thing haha.  I know this might shock some of you on what I'm about to say, but with the omelet having potatoes inside & it coming with home fries; it just was too much potatoes.  
 
The restaurant was steady, service was very slow to nonexistent, gave up on having my water cup refilled or even my coffee. I wanted to love Farmhouse, I waited so long to try them out, but I left unwowed."}
{"text":"I finally made it to The Farmhouse. It's always so busy and I am not very good at waiting. Picked an early weekday morning and set up camp. I sampled a little bit of this and that.  

I started with the Spinach,Tomato, Mushroom and Onion omelet. It was as close to perfect as an omelet can be. The veggies were cooked but NOT over cooked like so many places do and you end up with mushy veggies and that's just no good. The egg did not have a single brown mark on it, it was a moist and delicious adventure of flavor.

Next up was a side of the ham and bacon. These items had to made from pigs who died happy. 

I finished off with a side of Biscuits and Gravy and fried potatoes with onion. A+

Service- A+.  ( water glasses were filled! friendly smile! etc.)"}
{"text":"This breakfast spot is worth the line you will be in when arriving! Hands down the best home cooked breakfast i have had since leaving the East Coast!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast location in the valley.  I've been going for decades...the breakfasts taste the same as it did at their prior location - Delicious.  My friends and I had a reunion breakfast there (one from CA, one from WA, the other from Gilbert).  We felt like we stepped back 10+ years when we would meet there regularly for breakfast.  My husband who typically waits for nothing will suggest breakfast here, drive 30 minutes and willingly wait another 30 mnutes for a table and their chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Sooo.....


Their scrambles are pretty damn good. But since i live about 15 minutes away because of Arizonas million stop lights getting in the way of getting anywhere i refuse to go out of my way to gilbert unless i am off and a friend is willing to come with.  I personally love Crackers and Co so much more but i need to go to the farmhouse more before i really lay it out that i do not see a point in driving in that direction from chandler.  I also tried their cinnamon roll which was A-OK. Not the most amazing pastry i have ever had in my life but it was Okay.  
As much as i love eggs and scrambles  you would think this place would get 5 stars but i just love my crispy potatoes and eggs and meats at Crackers and Co SO much more. From what i can remember of the farmhouse with my very very late review i just don't remember The farmhouse blowing my mind. =\
As far as service goes they did an Okay job as well. Nothing stellar or over the top just your average every day get in get out kinda service.  The place itself seemed extremely cramped or small in space to walk without having to move aside or sit and wait for people to pass by to get anywhere. meh.
Oh well...

Until next time Farmhouse...You are Okay in my book.
=["}
{"text":"We didn't even eat here. The place is so small. We walked in and were just stared at by people scurrying by. No greeting or anything posted for directions on how to be seated. We left and went next door to eat! Much better service"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots I've eaten at and their coffee is actually really good too. The omelet I had was awesome. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place numerous times and we are always pleased with the service and the food. 

There are some things to note and perhaps will help with some of the reviews. 

- The restaurant is small and quaint. It's part of the charm. We are early risers so we never wait to be seated. Btw, If you come in and see a table open, make yourself at home and take a seat. If there is no tables open, write your name on the wait list notepad.

- Note that I just mentioned it's small and quaint; therefore large parties are not conducive. 

- If you wait, you will have to wait outside. I don't know why that is such an issue when the majority of restaraunts that are good have waiting and waiting is outside.

- The food: the food is good and consistent and perhaps we just like an old fashioned breakfast with no frills. The portions are big and in regards to the price, it's comparable to most at other place.

- Why 5 stars? Good food with large portions and great service, even at 7am."}
{"text":"Super good food cute little house and my parents were married here so it's always a fun place to visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie omelette with a side of biscuits. Excellent choice. The home style potatoes were delicious. The only downfall was the wait to get in, but at the same time, it was the line that piqued the curiosity. Definitely worth a repeat visit in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing! The biscuits and gravy are out of this world.. I love biscuits and gravy and this is a place I will go back to over and over again! The staff is friendly the place is very quaint and I will continue to patronize this restaurant for years to come!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch place! Only downfall is small dinning area but well worth the wait if you want food home style food at extremely reasonable prices. A+++"}
{"text":"Now this is home cooking! The best breakfast in town. The portions are ample and the quality is great. Best biscuits and sausage gravy in town. You have to try their cinnamon rolls!  They're quite large too!"}
{"text":"Very good overall with a few minor opportunities.  Staffing on par, selections great, but tight seating some might think is quaint but in reality is tight, especially the tables for 2 against the walls near each room entrance.  I had the eggs Benedict and he had the 2 egg breakfast.  Coffee was great but juice was served with ice???   Bacon was excellent, likely made in a cast iron skillet. Cute little area.  We will return."}
{"text":"This is a go to place for us! Wow! The food is superb, the service excellent, and the ambiance welcoming. I highly recommend this amazing eating. establishment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the Chandler/Gilbert area.  The atmosphere is very old school, like a breakfast dinner you might expect to see 30 years ago in the south.  Cozy, lots of antiques, and real everything is made on the premises-from scratch- feel.  It may or may not be, but it all tastes like it is!  

I'm not a cinnamon roll person, but their cinnamon rolls must be had! Soooooo good!  I've never come across another place with cinnamon rolls remotely close to how good their's are.

I usually get some kind of vegetarian breakfast scramble.  It's always good, and I can never finish it all.  Their biscuits are awesome!  I recommend subbing out your toast for a biscuit! You can also get free refills of coffee to go in big 24oz cups.  The cups are Styrofoam though.  I hate that.

 One thing I don't like is that they give you those individual package of smuckers jelly for your toast.  They all have high fructose corn syrup in them.  It seems like the kind of place that would have their own, locally made preserves.  

For a weekend breakfast, you have to get there very early, probably when they open, to beat the LONG line that forms.  They have a pad of paper outside that you just sign your name on.  Very efficient!  Usually I get there around 8/ 8:30 and only have a 15/ 20 minute wait.  After that, you may have to wait considerably longer.  Cinnamon roll makes it so worth it!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviewers, you have betrayed me! This food was barely edible. Their biscuits and gravy didn't taste anything like it should have and the biscuits were too dense and dry. The bacon and home fries also both tasted funny. I shared my food with 2 other people and they both agreed. It was a waste of $20... won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"A great homecooked breakfast!  I appreciated that they allowed my party of 4 to pick any open table of our choice.  The service was excellent.  I had the bread basket: 2 biscuits, a cinnamon roll, and a muffin.  The cinnamon was the best...a gooey middle and bright taste.  I was not crazy about the blueberry muffin.  The center was good, but the edges where the muffin was in the pan were hard, almost crunchy.  I also got a side of eggs and bacon...I was hungry!  The eggs were perfect, light and fluffy.  The bacon was crispy and much less greasier than one would expect.  My mom got a scrambler and wow it was enough for 3 meals!  I tried one of the homefries and they were excellent...crisp and seasoned appropriately.  This place is small and I heard it isn't unusual to wait for an hour on a Sunday morning so be aware.  We sat next to a Gilbert local who had nothing but great things to say about The Farmhouse.  If you want a great omelet or scrambler, look no further!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was excellent, wife ordered chorizo & green chili omelette, I ordered biscuits & sausage gravy. Decided to also get desert, cinnamon roll & blackberry cobbler. The food was too good to describe & the service was even better than that."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I ate here last weekend for breakfast for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. Food was great, service was good. Restaurant is pretty small, a bit of a tight fit so you may end up waiting a bit. We arrived around 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday and waited about 15 mins. so it wasn't too bad. I'd recommend and I'd eat here again. The restaurant could definitely use some additional decor considering it's supposed to be \"farmhouse\" style, it's pretty plain, no frills."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly stuff, and cozy place. Enjoyed breakfast with my son while visiting AZ"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast and lunch place in downtown Gilbert.  Service was very good, need to get here early unless you want to wait.  Only about 15 tables and they fill up early on the weekends."}
{"text":"Our party of 8 went to the Farmhouse for breakfast last Sunday.  The wait was a bit long, but in my opinion, that is the sign of a good restaurant.  The place is small, maybe holds 50 people.  The decor is what you would expect at a Farmhouse.  

Members of our party had pancakes, french toast, country fried steak, a veggie scramble and Belgian waffles.  Everyone was very satisfied with their food.

Service was good also.  Waitress was attentive and the food arrive timely.  Prices were very reasonable too."}
{"text":"The green chili  pulled pork omelet  was delightfully good.  The coffee was great, and so is the decor.  The cream chipped beef and biscuits are also pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"Some people on here are WAAAAYY to critical..  If you want a great breakfast and don't mind a wait for good food, EAT HERE!  This place has been in Gilbert (was in an actual farmhouse before, hence the name) for over 15 years and is still awesome.  Quit being to critical foodies and eat!!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Great service! I had the chili cheese omelet. Best omelets around. This is my new favorite place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I judge breakfast restaurants by their fruit cup because it's a staple of breakfast and often the item that gets the shaft in the food industry. Theirs was an interesting combo of meh. It had  strawberries  and yummy watermelon, but unripe melons (the staple of any fruit cup). I'm always sad when there isn't pineapple. 

The whole wheat pancakes and potatoes were great!! Service was pretty good.  Overall, the experience was better than average but not amazing. I like how the set up is all inclusive however. The table had all the condiments, creamer, sauces and jellies you could imagine before you've even ordered."}
{"text":"There is always a long wait on the weekends because this place is amazing. I have been going to the Farm House since they were at their original building and the food is so fresh, homemade and exceptional."}
{"text":"I love breakfast here!  Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had (sorry mom).  They have all the basics plus you can build your own scrambles, omelets, etc.  I love their vegetarian style scrambles.  The portions are so large that you can easily share with another person.  You have to try the warm cinnamon rolls for dessert (or take one home with  you).  Again, it is quite large and you will need help finishing it off.

The interior is very clean and simple with a monochromatic color scheme (much like what you expect from an actual farmhouse).  The staff is always very friendly and warm.  I guarantee there will be a wait on the weekends so get there early and put your name on the list.  

I did try this place for lunch and I feel the breakfast is far superior."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit our daughter and Grands a trip to the Farmhouse is usually in order for one breakfast experience.  Although we don't always get in and we opt out of the 45-60 minutes of waiting to go to one of several other great restaurants now in this quaint old town section of Gilbert.  This time we only had to wit 20 minutes for a booth and the service was exceptional.  They have made few changes over the years but recently it appears they have really organized the staff greatly improving the service.  We were there for less than an hour even with the 20 min. Outside wait time.  The food has never failed!  A #10 Omelette with sourdough toast and I was in heaven!  I almost forgot to take the pic it was so good!"}
{"text":"Only waited 5 minutes on a Saturday morning.  Service and the food were good. The  steak and eggs was on point."}
{"text":"I live in Tempe and the Farmhouse is hands down my favorite breakfast place in the valley.
 The staff is always very nice, they even often remember my boyfriend and I from previous visits. 
Their food is all (I think all) homemade including their gigantic cinnamon rolls that are out of this world, their biscuits that are so fluffy and good and their sausage patties that are done just right.
The portions are very large so you will never leave here hungry.
The atmosphere is laid back with a kind of quaintness about it.
The only bad thing is the wait on the weekends, but if you plan ahead and get in line before you're totally starving it's SO worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is always, ALWAYS amazing. Nothing has ever let us down. The potatoes are the BEST breakfast potatoes anywhere.  My husband is not a breakfast person, but insists the pulled pork green chile omelette is his favorite breakfast meal. True about the wait...very small inside. Waitress/waiters and cooks are super efficient,  so once you are in, you are good to go.  Today was the first time I felt the hostess seating people did not manage tables well. Was a little frustrating, but my full belly made me quickly forget (until now)."}
{"text":"A great brunch place that has been around Gilbert downtown for decades. A small but comfortable area with big servings. I LOVE their home style potatoes! A must side dish for all plates!"}
{"text":"This place has tasty food. The line is quite a wait though."}
{"text":"Ive seen the Farmhouse plenty of times, and always wanted to try it, but everytime i drove past the restaurant there were lines out the door, so i just never got around to it but today i decided to try it.

First off: the wait was NOT what i expected. i was a bit worried about the wait because it was memorial day and around 9:30am (which is usually the rush hour of breakfast restaurants) the wait was about 5 minutes so i was very surprised.

We get inside and it is absolutely adorable! I love how its such a tiny little place that looks so creaky and old and with so much character! We asked for coffee and water, although we only got our coffee.... we got our water maybe 20 minutes later.  The food was exceptional! Absolutely delicious! my only real complaint was that our server COMPLETELY ignored us after bringing us our food. She didnt check up to see if we needed anything or how the food was. We got our check around 20 minutes AFTER we were done eating.

Im overall pleased with the Farmhouse. My only complaint is the service. although it didnt bother me too much that our server was completely MIA because i didnt need anything once i got my food, but i can see it as a huge problem for other folks."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for some time and finally had the opportunity today.  I didn't expect much of a crowd on a Friday morning, however when we pulled in I was shocked to see about 10 people waiting outside.  Typical for a weekend morning breakfast joint.....but a weekday?  This place must be good.  Suprisingly, the wait was short...they obviously know how to handle a crowd at this place.  Once inside, I was impressed.  Pretty small, but we had plenty of room in our booth.  I ordered the eggs and sausage, which came with toast and potatoes. The food came out quick.  The thing that really set it apart was the meat.... this was no Jimmy Dean.  It was worthy of Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.  Needless to say, I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Our server recommended the cinnamon roll as a starter which was a good choice.  The roll the very soft and fresh and the topping was like a  cream cheese, cheesecake frosting.  Yummy! The food came EXTREMLY quick.  There was about four or five other tables and our food came out about ten min after we ordered.  I had an omelet.  Fresh,  thick bacon,  very good.  The toast is on a French bread which originally I didn't want but when it came out in was actually a thin bread so not a bulky French bread after all.  Very good food will def come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, highest quality ingredients and well prepared with some imagination. Beware, they have no deep fried foods, so no fries with that burger. Mostly breakfast and lunch fare with a cinnamon role that's worth the thirty minute drive to get!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast in Gilbert!  The food is always fresh and everyone is very friendly and helpful.  Better get there early to secure a table since he place is very small and can only accommodate a few large tables to fit my family.  Love the veggie scrambles!!"}
{"text":"First time here & I was a little disappointed. For one, they didn't have a kids menu which made for a lot of food even split up in between both of my kids. I ordered an omelette which was drenched in sour cream & made it very hard to eat. So that went to waste. Our server checked on us at the end of the meal when we asked for the check, I'm assuming she was busy? Idk. Maybe we will try this place again and order something else next time. Who knows?"}
{"text":"Delicious! Very homely with simple dishes. Relatively priced with a good aroma. 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"This place has been nothing short of amazing since the day I moved to Gilbert Arizona. No matter how many restaurants come to Downtown Gilbert there is always a line at The Farmhouse and for good reason. If you don't think so I'm glad cause you are one less person I have to wait in line behind."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! 
The staff is super friendly and the food is top notch! 
Come early if you don't want to wait! 
But even if you do wait it is totally worth the wait ! 
Sign in outside ! They will come get you as soon as tables   Are available! 

This place gets busy for a reason ! 

Enjoy ! 

Good for kids and family's they do groups as well but the seating area isn't big so don't bring too many people in your group!"}
{"text":"Quaint looking place, but I don't understand the draw.   Food is okay but nothing special and service was below par.  Now I haven't dined with this business since it moved to this location.  Last time I ate at The Farm House it was a tiny farmhouse alongside the road.
Server was kinda slow and really not familiar with the specials cuz \"she doesn't usually work on Thursdays\".  Whatever.  I mean there are only two (2) specials and Juevos Rancheros can be complicated.
Well I will get back to the food...
The ambiance is kitschy, simple, and sorta rustic.  The restaurant is small so it is no surprise to see long lines outside this place on a weekend morning.  
So I ordered the Juevos Rancheros special and my son ordered the pancakes with eggs and bacon.  We determined we could have had a better breakfast elsewhere. Seriously.  Pancakes seemed to be from a mix and my Juevos Rancheros were nothing more then eggs to order on top of corn tortilla and topped with red enchillada sauce (canned?!) with refries (canned?) and a sliced potato on the side.  Oh my, don't tell my NM, Mexican, Tex -Mex food fans.
Now canned isn't such a bad thing if it is done well but this seemed straight from the can.  
And on top of the less than mediocre meal a guy in the booth behind me was kicking on my side of the bench, talking loudly on his phone the entire time we were there to his homie about a girl with issues (HIS words).  
Prices didn't seem appropriate for food.  Maybe because of the location but certainly not the food.
Not coming back."}
{"text":"The service was alright and the food was pretty good. I ordered the chorizo, green chile, and cheese omelet and it came with house fries that were nice and crispy. The portions were big so it's definitely enough for a brunch-sized meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a good breakfast here with family. Staff is very friendly and professional. Restaurant was a little smaller than most but I really enjoyed being in an older building in a location with a lot of history. Food was delicious! Coffee was amazing! Enjoyed walking my food off after on Main Street looking at all the stores, seeing what they had to offer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've wanted to try it for a long time but the hordes of people always waiting outside put me off. My sister and I decided to do brunch on a Wednesday and there was STILL a wait, but it was manageable. We ordered regular drip coffee and it was really good. I knocked off a star because they don't serve real cream, just those little cups of processed half n half. As a coffee lover that's a big deal for me. After that we shared a cinnamon roll and OMG it was phenomenal. I ordered an omelet and so did my sister. They are huge and delicious and perfect. We both had enough left over for another meal. Considering everything, I think the prices are on point. If they get some real cream they would be my favorite breakfast place, hands down.

***edited to add***

We went there again today and I'm adjusting my review to 5 stars. If you want real cream, get a cafe au lait. So amazing."}
{"text":"We showed up after finding this place on Yelp in the morning at our hotel room. It looked highly rated so we figured we would give it a shot. We were here on a Monday at about 10:30 am. It's easy to find in the \"historical\" area of Gilbert. It wasn't too busy at all luckily.

We ordered pancakes, eggs, bacon and a cinnamon roll (apparently this is a must have?). The roll was RIGHT out of the oven and the icing poured out of it. It was easily the best one I have ever eaten or could have dreamed to eat. 

The pancakes were the size of a human adult HEAD. There was little chance we could eat 2 of them. The eggs were delicious (I like mine poached and no one makes them right) I put them on my toast as I usually do and I was shocked at how good it was. I've eaten poached eggs on toast my entire life but somehow the sourdough and the eggs just SANG in my mouth. 

Our waitress was a super friendly girl who really had a sincere interest in talking to us which is a departure from Southern California where all service staff do is ask if you want more diet coke. Maybe it is because her family is from the midwest, or perhaps it is because Gilertians are just friendlier. 

If you enjoy breakfast and you enjoy cute little restaurants you will like this place.

I almost forgot that we got the home fries. These things are wicked good. I can't really tell you how good they are because you're going to need to just try them on your own. Some crispy, some soft just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Based on the wait line, farmhouse need to expand a little bit more!! But otherwise their service are great, servers are nice and attentive. The food is awesome. I always get an omelette with mushrooms , ham, turkey, jalapeños, and hash brown. Favorite go to break fast place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with our friends from out of town.  My girlfriend and I got mimosas, which are HUGE and delicious and the table split a cinnamon roll.  Highly recommend both of those.  All the dishes that we got were fantastic and we can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get breakfast. I could honestly order anything off the menu and be satisfied. The biscuits and gravy are really good! The French toast is probably my favorite. They always cook the eggs perfectly, and their sausage is delicious! 

They have really awesome lunch food as well. I've only been once but their sandwiches are all great.

In general, some really delicious homestyle food for a good price! Nice atmosphere, great service. Beats Liberty Market any day."}
{"text":"YES, YES, YES....  Please eat here, the food is soooooo good!!!! Others complaining it took to long to get their table, bleh on you. This is a Mom & Pops place, everyone seems to be working their butt off. It is so good the wait is out the door, people need to stop being Veruca Salts. But daddy I want a table... I want a table now daddy. Sometimes you need to wait a little for the good stuff. Or come on a weekday  =)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is super cozy, seating seems slightly crowded. The food is great and the staff is friendly and very accommodating. You absolutely have to try the cinnamon rolls, they are amazing! Highly recommend if you are in the Gilbert area and looking for a good place to chow down on some excellent breakfast food."}
{"text":"Adorable little spot. The food was excellent. Most of the breakfast menu is scrambles or omelets and they are delicious. It tastes like a breakfast I could make at home but I don't. Service was great, too. The place is small so get there early or you will probably have to wait"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to venture out and try this place for breakfast. It's small and quaint, like I could high five the person next to us cozy. Our server was super nice. We ordered food and before we knew it it was on our table. It was super good. It had a bed and breakfast feel to it. We were happy and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is my husband and my favorite weekend breakfast spot. The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and I love the cozy rustic environment. While I think it deserves the 5 stars because I have had nothing but great experiences, I do have some words of caution:

- Since this place is a Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch place it gets busy pretty quickly and since it's small, you'll probably have to wait outside. If you see people waiting outside for a table and you're ok waiting there is a notepad sitting outside for you to put your name on instead of going inside. There isn't really a designated hostess so this is their method.
- Since the place is very very small I would not recommend coming here with a large group. There are two larger round tables that could maybe seat around 6 people, but I wouldn't recommend coming here with any more than 4 people.

So if you are looking for a place to have an early breakfast, late lunch, or you're ok waiting outside a little bit for a table, and you're in a smaller group, then this is the perfect place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place!  Everything is always so fresh and tastes great!  TINY place and usually has a wait but it is well worth it.  The wait usually isn't too long either.  I would have to say one of the best breakfast joints I've found in the valley in 9 years living here!"}
{"text":"So many good items the worst part about this place is deciding what to get lol hehe! :-)

Remember your appetite ;)"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast I have ever had. I am normally not a breakfast person, but I will wake up early for their chocolate chip pancakes. I brought my father here today and he enjoyed the chicken fried steak and eggs with biscuits and gravy and he said it was the best breakfast he has ever had! The food here is amazing! I love coming here!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to share, I'm selfish by nature. Not proud of the fact but a character flaw that has been working out for me so far. So, why do I share? I can't help myself and it is so good, I do believe I could be meddling with my karma by not mentioning this little know fact....The Farm House is serving dinner. Yep, you got it. Dinner. One night a week, Friday to be exact from 5pm-8pm and yes, you can order beer or wine. Mother of God, it is nirvana and this is not due to the fact that I live in Chandler and have eaten everywhere else! 

Dinner items are meatloaf with mashed potatoes, ham steak w/scalloped potatoes, chicken and biscuits...OUTRAGEOUS! There is more, I just couldn't memorize the whole menu. 

Now, I'm not a down home cookin' kinda girl. In fact, I would tell you that down home cookin' is just an excuse for not trying hard enough. Well, take me behind the wood shed and beat me silly, this down home cookin' is amazing. I have never ordered anything with biscuits as part of a main entree and again, after the severe beating with a fence post I deserve, the chicken and biscuits is luscious, buttery, chickeny gravy goodness that curls up on your fork and and caresses your tongue till you can love it no more and are forced to chew! 

The wait staff is courteous, swift to keep your water glass filled, helpful with the menu, have tried all the entrees and to kick things off will offer you a dinner roll before your entree. Yes, its a single roll and dumbo (me) rolled her eyes, I'm a slow learner and said no. Well, the rocket scientists I went to dinner with had the sense to say. \"Hell Yes\" and the dinner roll from heaven with wings arrived on its own cake plate with a pat of butter. Don't be an idiot, get the roll. Learn from my stupidity. Enjoy your Friday in Gilbert, do not take my table and tell no one, it will be our secret."}
{"text":"My cousin said I needed to try this local place..boy was it good.  The spinach in my omelet was so fresh.  My brother and biscuits and gravy and it was very good..diff than Bob Evans sausauge gravy..tasted really fresh and like there was sage in it.  The home fries were not too greasy just perfect. Portions are so big we got to eat breakfast again later!  This place is really really small go early and if there is a wait make sure you sign your name outside the front door and take a seat and take in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast you'll find in AZ. Super casual and friendly, love the atmosphere and the food is hands down amazing"}
{"text":"So we had only gone for breakfast before. We have had two of the happiest lunches recently. The meatloaf is down home yum...the roasted chicken on Fridays is AMAZING! It's shredded in the gravy of the gods and those rolls are fluffy rounds of magic. This place really doesn't get any better. And for dessert if you can get the lemon or coconut pin raps cake you are in luck!"}
{"text":"Very good, basic American breakfast.  Nothing fancy here, but that's not their target; hence, the name \"Farmhouse\".  They get it right with a rustic simple decor.  Staff immediately greeted us and sat us.  Everyone at our table ordered egg dishes.  The food was fresh, hot, and flavorful.  The side salsa looked and tasted homemade (yeah!).  Freshly squeezed OJ always gets a thumbs up.  The café-au-lait caught my eye, but only after I had ordered regular coffee (which was well balanced, medium strength, and not bitter).  Service was pleasant and efficient, given that every table was full in this tiny eatery.  After we arrived, there were intermittent short lines outside (always a good sign, especially on a weekday)."}
{"text":"Never was much for the idea of chicken and waffles.  Ordered it and have been craving another round ever since.  Excellent place for breakfast.  Go early because they get super busy."}
{"text":"So, after several years, we decided to stop back in here for breakfast.

Now... I don't know what changed from last time, but it seems like -EVERYTHING- changed from last time. I actually asked to make sure that my bacon wasn't too crispy, so maybe that helped? I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of not-too-crispy bacon, and my girlfriend ordered the two eggs and sausage with hashbrowns and toast.

Everything was amazing. I don't mean amazing as in a generic \"amazing\", I mean amazing as in \"HOLY SHIT  THIS IS GENUINELY AMAZING\", amazing. Everything was just so damned fresh, and it really made a difference. 

We were talking earlier and wondering how this place had stayed open all of these years, especially in light of recent competition which has moved in nearby. What we figured out was that The Farmhouse doesn't really do anything fancy- they do the classics. They do the greatest hits. They don't have an expansive selection of cheekily-named eggs bennies, or imported chorizo from an obscure region of Catalonia, but what they *DO* have is amazing traditional American breakfasts which really stand out.

... wait... I think they actually might have chorizos... ah well. Everything else I said is true."}
{"text":"Wow, incredible breakfast. Had a basic one with eggs over easy, bacon, fried potatoes and biscuits and gravy. One of the best breakfasts I've had in a restaurant in many years. The home fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Eggcellent breakfast. Breakfast Potatoes are unreal as well as the Cinnamon Roll. Will be back again and again! Everything was fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast/brunch: generous cinnamon rolls, unique omelette's, and more.  There can be a long wait on a weekend, so come early or late."}
{"text":"Honestly, while we only experienced one true negative in relation to the food, I don't get the hype.  It's average to good diner food in my opinion. 

Very small interior for such a popular restaurant, so be prepared for a wait.  You put your name on a list outside and wait for them to call you in. They have a few tables for groups, but the majority are smaller 2-3 person tables. 

My mom ordered a waffle with fruit. The waffle was the one negative in terms of the food. No crispness to it at all. Very floppy, chewy and lacking in flavor. Tasted like a powder mix. Also, \"with fruit\" gave the impression you'd have fruit or berries on your waffle. Instead, it was a bowl of fruit (grapes, melon, strawberries) on the side. 

My dad ordered an omelet, but they made him a scramble instead. He went ahead with the scramble rather than having them remake it. Other than the order mix-up, nothing to complain about.

I ordered the avocado, bacon, tomato & cheese scramble with a side of beans. Scramble was good.  You get a ton of beans, and they had some decent flavor to them.  While the whole grain French bread \"toast\" was yummy, I'm not a fan of toast being a toasted loaf of French bread. Too much bread. Just my opinion. 

So all in all, we had a decent breakfast. The name Farmhouse made me think farm fresh ingredients, but I'm not convinced that's the case. I definitely wouldn't wait for 45 minutes ever again because it's not THAT good, and there are other decent breakfast spots nearby."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spot in Gilbert! This place has it all, the charm, the exceptional service and the delicious food.
My son and I stopped in for breakfast last Saturday, waited about 10 minutes to be called after putting our name down. There is no room to wait outside but they have some benches and misters outside (which is greatly appreciated).

The service was great, we had a waitress that was efficient, multiple people visited our table, to top off water or remove plates and the food was delivered hot and all at the same time.
My son raved about their breakfast sandwich. Sourdough bread, over medium egg, bacon, lettuce and tomato. He also ordered chocolate milk, which was served in an ice cold mug. I had to try it, to report to you that is, and because, well it was served in an ice cold mug and that reminded me of beer. It was delicious.

I ordered the home potatoes, a ham steak and some tomatoes. The ham steak was perfect, not too salty and not overcooked.
Finally we had a cinnamon roll, and oh my, that was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in AZ. I always come here when I am in town visiting. Get here early cause this place is always busy. Although I never get their lunch items, I hear they are just as good. I am a sucker for breakfast so I always order it, no matter what time of day. 

Their special board always has something good on it but my favorites are their Omelettes and their cinnamon rolls. The French Toast is great too. 

The staff is always so nice and the prices are great. I love this place."}
{"text":"We tried based on Yelp reviews and the ravings didn't disappoint. We had good ambiance, good customer service and delicious food. We went on a Sunday at 10 a.m., so our wait was about 45 minutes, and it took another long 5 minutes once we sat down for a server to swing by our table, but from there until the end, spectacular. The cinnamon roll arrived warm and melted into our mouths. more cream cheesy than others I've tried, but delicious nonetheless. I had the No. 14 I believe... sausage, bacon and potato omelet. The boys got Mickey Mouse pancakes that were light and fluffy. I didn't like my cafe au lait so the server took it off our bill and gave me a cup of fresh coffee on the house in a to-go cup so I wouldn't have to settle for sneaking sips from my husband's cup, which I found thoughtful. It was worth the drive to try something new and we'll definitely go back again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I've been to this part of Gilbert before to eat at other restaurants in the area, but finally made it to the Farmhouse this morning for brunch.  I've been meaning to come here for some time, but seem to make it after its closed!

My friend and I pulled up for a very late breakfast, and the place was hopping. Its located immediately next door to Liberty market, and there was a line outside waiting to get in.  The place is small, so there's no waiting inside.  Also, when we got here, I found out from another customer that we had to put our own names on the waiting list! I don't mind waiting, but had no clue that we had to sign our own names!  

Anyways, it was only about a 20 minute wait or so, but we were starting to get hot, so we finally got a seat in the shade near the misters once the crowd started to thin out.

Inside, the place is small, but the seating seems fair.  No hanging out in the aisles, or else you block the servers!  Despite being crazy busy, we were waited on almost immediately.  No problems there.  Service was quick and efficient, and at one point I think we counted 7 servers!  Menu is full of selection, a little bit of everything.  I went with the #19 omelette, which was loaded full of veggies and cheese. Spinach, cheese, tomatos, etc. It came with some tasty hash browns and two huge slices of toast! My friend with the big john (I think, I can't remember) and he loved it! He also got the chocolate milk and it looked really good.

Anyways, I would love to return as the food was really good and service seemed to be top notch.  The only sucky thing is really waiting outside.  Go here if you can. Seems to be a really original type place."}
{"text":"When you get there you write on a pad outside and in a few minutes a waitress comes and sits you. The food was fresh and delicious. We had a great waitress and would return again."}
{"text":"I've never been here for brunch but will add to once I visit. This is BY FAR the best breakfast I've had in the valley. There is always a bit of a wait because the place is small but very nice and the food is fabulous! Centrally located in downtown Gilbert so that's also a plus. Awesome location. I had a spinach scramble, fiancé had bacon, eggs and hash browns and my nephew had a big mickey mouse pancake. It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a friend as neither of us had been here and the atmosphere and food did not disappoint. They had a \"specials\" board as well as their menu outside so we were able to explore our options prior to being seated. They had a decent selection of breakfast and lunch, even 24 different omelet combinations! Initially service was fantastic, we were offered drinks almost as soon as we were seated and our server came back shortly after to take our meal order. After ordering our food was out relatively quickly which was pleasant, and the plates were huge! I ordered an omelet with my friend ordering their cobb salad and we both left full while still having leftovers! The food is great, and the atmosphere is absolutely quaint, a perfect picture of what Old Town Gilbert has to offer. Our only complaint was that once we got our food our waitress seemed to have disappeared and we had to ask someone to find her for us in order to receive our check after we finished eating. It was frustrating as we saw her come back from talking to another server after we had asked for her, but overall the atmosphere and food were terrific and I will be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by on a whim just 30 minutes before they closed on a Friday. We were fortunate to be able to come right in and sit down, at least I think so after always seeing an enormous line as we drove past! They have the BEST french toast, it's nothing extravagant and is very simple but absolutely perfect. My husband really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich and our daughter loved sharing with both of us. The home fries here are to die for! 

The atmosphere is so cozy and homey, there aren't many tables but that's one of my favorite things about it. I still think about that french toast and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to have a late breakfast and decided to come here on a weekday.  On the weekends this place is PACKED so we wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  I have read that service is slow and I can agree it was slowwwww.  We ordered egg scramble, open faced roast beef sandwich, and biscuits and sausage gravy.

Egg scramble- packed with the ingredients we ordered but the egg was very overcooked and rubbery.  Instead of home fries we got a pancake.  And I must say best pancake I have every eaten!

Open faced roast beef sandwich- Honestly the roast beef was at most average.  Their mashed potatoes and gravy were SO GOOD.  Such fluffy mashed potatoes and perfectly seasoned gravy.  

Biscuits and sausage gravy- You know how this dish can always be overwhelming and heavy.. for some reason this was not! The biscuits were so light and fluffy and the sausage gravy was just perfection on top.  

Curious to come here again.  Will be back for more southern cooking !"}
{"text":"Visiting my family in Arizona tends to mean we cook and eat.  A LOT of food.  In between cooking meals for ourselves, sometimes we head out to a place that will make home cooked food for us.  And Farm House restaurant delivers delicious, home cooked food.  I've only been for breakfast, so I can't comment on lunch or dinner items, but the breakfast is good.  Seriously good.  So many people think \"How hard can it be to cook an egg?\" and so many people mess up that egg.  But The Farm House does not!  Delicious omelets that are fresh are made to order, and are packed full of the meats and veggies.  Literally, I ate probably 1/4 of my omelet because it was THAT big.  They make great home fries and have interesting whole wheat french bread.  I prefer toast though, as the french bread toasted is basically a baugette that's been sliced in half, brushed with butter and grilled.  It works for some people, not so much for me."}
{"text":"Not really worth the drive for me, but the food was pretty good. If you're in the area, you should check it out. They have a pretty basic and standard breakfast, but it's easy to fuck up standard and basic and they did a good job. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but I liked it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Biscuits and Sausage Gravy and my wife ordered the French Toast.  We also had a side of link sausage and a blueberry muffin.  It wasn't that the food wasn't good, but I think the summary for a 2-star from Yelp sums it up: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Especially for the price.  Total bill with an OJ and coffee+tip?  $29.22.  Way, way too much for an average breakfast.  The cinnamon rolls seem like they're good--but my wife makes the Ultimate Cinnamon Buns from Cook's Country Kitchen and there's no beating those.  Can't say we'll be back to the Farmhouse--and we certainly won't wait for it."}
{"text":"Went around 1pm on a Saturday for lunch and was surprised to find nobody waiting beforehand. The restaurant was half empty when we were seated and waitresses were kind enough to check up on us the minute we sat down. 

I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad which was over seasoned with a special thai seasoning. With the dressing on the side, the salad tasted like pure sodium. It was not my favorite dish. But the omelet my lunch date ordered was decently sized and seemed to please him quite well. The cinnamon roll we ordered came out later than our meals due to our waitress' confusion. She apparently had problems with the frosting machine cause the entire plate was drenched in it. Some may have found this welcoming but it was quite disappointing to see one of my top five indulgences be presented so poorly ... haha but taste wise, it was pretty enjoyable...although a little too sweet due to the unnecessary amount of frosting. 

Overall, cute restaurant. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Cool spot got the biscuits and gravy. can't wait til the construction in the area is over so this place gets the business it deserves but until then its my secret spot."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Usually I think places with a lot of reviews tend to be overrated, but this place passed with two thumbs up. 

The pancakes are delicious and the bacon is thick and flavorful. My mom had an omelet and said it was nothing spectacular,  yet she really enjoyed the potatoes."}
{"text":"The family went for Father's Day. I entered looking to give our name to a hostess. A hurried waitress tells me to go back outside, there is a notepad I am to write my name on. Okay... After looking through the crowd (there is no front area to the place so everyone crowds around out front) I located said notebook. No clue what the wait time is because an employee they call the hostess doesn't actually talk to anyone unless you are able to catch her to ask a question. She doesn't wait in the heat like the rest of us. (I did notice her standing in a waitress prep area in full view eating her plate of eggs though.) The seating provided out front is not sufficient considering how uncomfortable it can be to be standing outside on a literal sidewalk. They were kind enough to supply ice water.

The food wasn't that great. The portions are good, but there are things that need improvement.  We were all sitting there saying that we'd have to order two meals to get what we wanted. Even a couple of eggs was a few bucks times two for some reason. The price wasn't exactly justified in my opinion. The pancakes were generous. Couldn't even cut through one, let alone two. So dense and spongy at the same time. Tasted like a generic mix. Bacon just missed being called burnt to a crisp. We thought the eggs were good and the omelette was decent. 

Service was okay. Not that many tables and several waitresses, but still seemed like they could barely handle the tables. Also took a little long to get our check. 

Bottom line. Would we go back? Don't think so. There are much better places."}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorites for breakfast. Everything tastes like home cooking and the portions are hearty. I also love the simple decor and friendliness of the staff.

Although I've only been here for breakfast, I'm dying to try the rest of the menu. The lunches look like comfort food incarnate! Judging from the meal I've had, I can only imagine that everything coming out of their kitchen is equally good. There is no substitute for fresh, cooked-to-order food that is served with this much love."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions! My family and I really enjoyed our Saturday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place. The line out front was a little off-putting, but once I saw the size of the place it all made sense. First off, their morning glory mimosa is freaking delicious. Ice cold and refreshing. I also had the chicken fried steak special. It was topped with biscuits and gravy and oh so good. We'll definitely be back for one of your famous omelettes! Seriously. There's 24 of them. Do it."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast and love the setup, reminds me of a country house back in the midwest.  The food and service was really good and I would go back for another visit to try another item on the menu.  Only drawback would be parking if it got really busy, but we were able to go right in and be seated.."}
{"text":"Farm House is a quaint local establishment in downtown Gilbert. There is a very homey feel and that vibe was given off by the host and waitress. We were surprised to see Illy coffee on the menu. So delicious! The food is above average. If you enjoy breakfast you will really love the food here. My brother ordered an omelet and it was PACKED full. Looked delicious. The menu made me want to go back and try some of the other stuff... muffins, cinnamon rolls, the different combination of omelets... the list goes on. Well worth going back."}
{"text":"Wowzers! This place was great! I have never gone before due to the long lines on the weekend but I happened to have this morning off and me and my husband decided to see what it was all about. We start with your basic coffee which was fine. I was your average joe. Then we both  ordered the breakfast sandwich and shared a side of biscuits and gravy. You cant have breakfast without biscuits and gravy right?? well let me tell those biscuits were MIND-BLOWINGLY good. We have tried almost all the breakfast spots in gilbert and these were by far the best. The breakfast sandwich was really great too. Very fresh tasting. Its a very very small place that is why there is always a line and the table are made for only 2 or 4 people so I wouldnt suggest this place for a large group. Super cute country decor and great pricing for what you get. Oh and the homefries were cooked to perfection. two thumbs up and 5 stars for me. but dont go on the weekend the line is crazy."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of The best places in Gilbert!  We are so lucky to have a place like this!  The servers are genuine and real and always remember our names and what we have ordered in the past.  The prices are low and the food is incredible and well worth the buck.  If we want to start out our day feeling great we go there.  Some of my favorites are:  The fried chicken special, the meatloaf, the biscuits and gravy and the pancakes are divine!  Let's not forget how amazing the omelettes are and the French bread toast!  Love!!  Just remember when you get there put your name on the list outside the door and they will see you promptly when they have an open table, it is a small mom-and-pop operation and they are incredible!"}
{"text":"Overall I just wasn't super impressed with this place.  I heard good things about it, so I decided to brave the very long wait...which is always present and eat breakfast here.  The food was decent, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing that truly stood out to me and it's quite crowded.   Sorry, but I would rather go to the Gilbert House down the street any day."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite casual dining restaurant in all of Gilbert. In fact, all of Arizona. Their menu is diverse and each item is absolutely delicious. The wait time my be pretty long over the weekend as it tends to attract large groups but it is absolutely worth the wait. All their food tastes fresh and amazing and you can tell they put a lot of care and attention into what they cook and how they cook it. The staff always seem friendly and happy to take your order.

The atmosphere is also fantastic as they have outdoor seating with an amazing, peaceful view. I also recommend the little coffee shop that is located next to the restaurant.

Overall just an amazing place to grab some amazing food with friends and family."}
{"text":"Great place! We came here for brunch on a holiday Monday - there was a short wait but it wasn't bad - the place is tiny so you write your name on the list outside and wait. We all opted for breakfast rather than lunch and it was delicious. The biscuits were great - french toast was awesome and the bacon was super good. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and the service this morning. Love the atmosphere.  Love the hibiscus drink, delicious."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Farm House Restaurant.  Sure it is busy..but that is a sign of a GOOD thing.  We try to schedule for a late breakfast or an early lunch and usually have no problem getting in.
The food is wonderful and they always have a daily special.
We try to support local businesses..and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Our first time!  Will be back. A lot. Delish. Omelet. Cinnamon roll!  Biscuits and gravy!  Top notch service. Wait wasn't even very long on a Saturday morning. Now we know why there's always a line."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic, and though the line can look intimidating, it goes pretty quickly. I have never tried their lunch menu, but their breakfast is out of this world. Their baked goods (biscuits, muffins, ect.) are def. worth a visit just to try them out. This is one of the best breakfast joints in the Valley."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER TASTED!!! THANK YOU FARMHOUSE FOR YOUR AWESOME FOOD. :-)

So, that was my daughter's review.  But I have to echo her comments.  This place is fantastic! Great service, great atmosphere, and of course great food.  Loved that this place had both breakfast potatoes AND hashbrowns.  I ordered the ham and cheese and hashbrown omelette with hashbrowns on the side.  I like hashbrowns.  My wife and daughter split a wonderful waffle with chocolate chips.  Awesome.  We will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Breakfast and Lunch all day, food was amazing and the service was great! New favorite!!"}
{"text":"Great place, delicious breakfast, relatively cheap. Sad that they don't use real maple syrup, but their cinnamon buns are amazing and their scrambles are top-notch."}
{"text":"After living in Gilbert for 12 years, we thought it was about time to patronize this eatery.  Country charming, clean and quaint.  And by quaint, I mean pretty small... but they make good use of the limited space.  I liked the 4 seater counter.

One note for newcomers.  Don't sit at the booth closest to the front door.  We visited on a cold January morning, and the arctic chill that blew in every time someone opened that door, made my nipples stand at attention.  Cooled my food off pretty quickly too.

I can only imaging how hot it gets during the dog days of summer.

The food was good, but I wouldn't purposefully wait longer than a half an hour, due to the liberal portion sizes."}
{"text":"We've been fans of this mother and daughter operation for many years now. The Farmhouse is one of our favorite spots. The biscuits and gravy are the best we've had. The cinnamon rolls are a favorite, too. Chicken and dumplings on the Monday special is delicious. I have a friend who can't resist the meat loaf. When I feel like salad, the Cobb can't be beat. The friendly staff is great, too. Check it out!  

There can be a wait sometimes. If you see people out front, just put your name on the list by the front door. Sometimes we'll drive by first to see what the wait is like. If it's non-existent or short, we'll stop. They're only open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I enjoy Farmhouse, but never leave \"wowed\" for some reason.

The food is solid. High-quality, fresh, and well-prepared. The menu is pretty straightforward in its approach, no curveballs. They focus on breakfast and lunch, a bold move, but do them both real well. The food is really good, but there is no dish I've tried that I love.

The dining room is cool. They decorated it rustic and it's fun. I love that they have Master Bedroom by Andrew Wyeth Dog Sleeping up on a shelf to the left when you go in. It's a picture that makes me smile. The A/C could be turned to a little bit lower temp, IMHO. I sometimes feel hot. There is a fair amount of seating, but it can fill up, so don't rule out the idea of a wait.

If you care about food, check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"$26 for 2 granolas, 2 coffees and 1 fruit bowl. Really?!! 
Then the waitresses have some weird wait system that must mean you have to wait FOREVER to get your check. I literally had to yell at one who kept walking past with the coffee pot in order to pay.  It was obvious we were done way before that. Learn the signs. Forks and spoons across the plate mean we are done!! 
I don't normally do bad reviews but mornings should start out good! 
Should have went to Hangar Cafe instead."}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews, but this is going to be an exception. After being in the area and looking up on Google to find a nearby breakfast restaurant, The Farmhouse Restaurant came up in my search. The ratings were great, and I love downtown Gilbert anyway, so I figured I would give it a try, and I am so glad I did! 

Let me preface this by saying that I think the very best cook in the universe is my own mom. She never cooked anything Gourmet, but instead the opposite. Very comfortable, homey, warm and welcoming foods. As a result, I have always been somewhat disappointed with other restaurants because I had a tendency to compare their food to that in which I grew up eating from my own kitchen.

I ordered the omelette with mushrooms, grilled onions, grilled bell peppers, cheese and tomatoes and swapped out my toast for a pancake. If I would not have known better, I would have said that my mom was the one in the back cooking the food! It was the very best breakfast I have ever had from a restaurant in all my 38 years. 

When I was done, I was completely stuffed from half of the omelet and just a few bites of the pancake. The server said that they use five or six eggs per each omelette and I totally believe it. They stuffed it full of fresh vegetables that were good sized pieces. When I asked the server to bring me two boxes to put the food in, the intention was to put the pancake in one box so I could put syrup on it and the other box to put the omelette in so that it would not get syrup on it. She brought out two boxes as I had requested, and 2 sealed Smuckers syrup containers! It is like they were already thinking ahead.

The atmosphere is small and very homey. I love that it was not big and clanky like you would experience at chain restaurants. I normally get a little anxious being in big restaurants with a bunch of people. But I wanted to stay inside The Farmhouse Restaurant all day! It genuinely has a feel like the most comfortable home you have ever been in. I did not get the name of my server, but she was a doll! Very accommodating and super kind. She had pink hair, and was great at her job. You could definitely tell that she was happy to be there. She did not rush me, but brought my check out at the perfect time where I didn't have to sit and wait or ask for it either.

The women's restroom is just darling. From the black and white octagon shaped tiny tiles on the floor to the big farmhouse sink with gooseneck faucet, it all fit perfectly like an adorable puzzle.

I cannot wait to go back to the Farmhouse Restaurant! Anytime I have friends or family come into town, this is definitely going to be our go-to restaurant. I am looking forward to trying out their menu for lunch and dinner as well.

If you are on the fence about whether or not you should go, please trust my review and go!"}
{"text":"Housed in an old storefront along Gilbert Road near the watertower, the Farmhouse delivers the best breakfast for miles around. The cinnamon bun - WOW. Best ever. The green chile chicken omelot is stunningly tasty. The all veg omelot - wonderful. The OJ is fresh squeezed, the coffee is excellent and the link sausages are like Mom used to make long ago. A classic place for breakfast and worth the drive to Gilbert - highly recommended and the BEST place for breakfast in the Valley. / We're still looking for a better place and haven't found it in Arizona."}
{"text":"After the holiday, I went to try breakfast for the 1st time at the Farmhouse. The first impression is that the place is very charming and Pinterest-y. The servers are all female and helpful. We ordered the specials - chorizo and black bean omelette with salsa verde and the veggie scramble. It has asparagus, broccoli and other green goodness. Both meals were served with whole wheat baguette and potatoes. I was not a fan of the potatoes and they were sliced in large discs and were not crispy. I was a fan of my omelette and the portion of it was huge we had to take some home. They were good with refilling our iced tea and coffee and at the end of the meal we split the cinnamon roll. Very homemade and the most delicious cream cheese frosting. That was definitely a hit.  I ordered a meal for my brother to-go, he said the Farmhouse Ham steak and eggs were very tasty as well. 

There seemed to be a wait for other folks so we hustled out of there. Tip is to come early like we did, around 8:45 AM, even though this was a random Tuesday. The place is small and the wait might be annoying in the outside heat.

I enjoyed my meal and looking forward to the other Sunday tip when they serve country fried steak, but only on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place may have good reviews, but our experience was awful they have no space to accommodate parties greater then 4.  they have a ridiculous waiting system where you put your name on a notepad outside the door but while you are waiting someone else walks up and squeezes their name on the preceding page to jump the line.   In addition because they have no dedicated seating staff people who were gone when their name was called can return and claim they were skipped and be seated right away before people who had been waiting.  So enjoy waiting on a sidewalk with traffic speeding by because you will be doing so for awhile.  We had been quoted a twenty minute wait and we finally left from frustration after over an hour of waiting. I do not recommend ever going to this establishment when there is a plethora of other options in the community."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with the hubby while running early errands. Quite empty for 7AM on a Thursday morning & seated very quickly. We ordered the avocado, bacon, tomato & cheese omelet for me (it was HUGE!) & hubs had the massive buttermilk pancakes, bacon & egg (also huge!). Service was efficient & our server sassy. I didn't finish mine, so either come with an appetite or take home the rest for later."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this lovely restaurant.  Very quaint and cozy.  Everyone is crammed in, but you do not feel crammed.  The menu is extensive and food is good.  The biscuits and gravy and we're fantastic and the omelets are worth ordering.  The French toast could use more flavor and the \"famous\" cinnamon roll was nothing fancy.  Overall a great place for breakfast.  All homemade and generous portions."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
I finally got to try Farm house on Monday 9/28 after getting back into town. Everyone knows that I love breakfast!  After that grand breakfast from Mission, I was like a fiend chasing the next breakfast high. We both had the omelets with veggies.  Bacon in mine and sausage in Mr H's omelet. In all it's tasty deliciousness, the omelets come with homemade potatoes, and wheat toast.  Nice breakfast spot, and the portions are huge, it was my only meal for that day, it was that filling but not as great as Mission.
Interesting Fact about breakfast: Eating breakfast has an advantageous effect on late-morning mood, satiety and cognitive performance."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Quaint, cozy, food can't be properly described except mouth wateringly good! Neighborhood gem!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was long and well worth it.  They have a mist system setup for people waiting outside...wish they had better coverage since it was a long line.  If you need to wait, ask the staff for some water.

The seating is a bit crowd.  Our waitress did a great job getting everything we needed.  I really like their biscuits and gravy, and my wife loved the fresh veggies in her omelette.  We were both stuffed!"}
{"text":"I liked the small restaurants in downtown Gilbert. The Farm House has this unique charm. The brick and mortar and exposed wood beams add to the charm. The menu was a classic American breakfast that is made fresh. I had ham,jalapenos and sour cream omelet that was amazing. The potatoes were great and seasoned perfectly. The staff was friendly, inviting and service was prompt. I will return for breakfast when I'm in the area in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"No wonder there is a line here on saturdays.....this is only one of the two breakfast places I like in the Phoenix area. Very friendly staff and good service. Inside is small though. Try the two buttermilk pancakes...mmm. bacon is done right....nice and crispy. The eggs seems to be a local item? Very good as well. I think the chicken fried steak could have being better....I suggest switching off the meat for grass fed one....as it will give it more flavor. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Small dinning area in downtown with street parking.  Service was OK.  Definite stop for locals.  Waiting area is outside.  Put your name on list BEFORE you walk in to check seating.  I would not wait long to be served because too many other places near."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! First, when we walked in, there was no hostess. There was no sign to wait to be seated, and there was no sign that said seat yourself. Immediately as you enter the business, there is not a cash register or waitress greeting table, through the door and you are immediately in the middle of people eating their food. We stood there for a minute...or three and everyone just stared at us like we did something wrong. We looked down and there was a chair next to the entrance with menus. Ohhh, must be seat yourself. We took menus and sat down, at a table which turned out to be dirty with crumbs, and water from old soft drinks. You didnt notice it until you sat. We watched as waitresses finally emerged from the back. They glared angrily and just walked past us. Im sorry, did we do something wrong? Eventually, after seating two tables that walked in, immediately by the way, a lady came over. She apologized, not for not seating us, not for walking past us repeately without helping us, but for the dirty table. We almost walked out, but decided we will give them one last shot. At least the mystery was solved, wait all day for the rude servers to seat you!

We both had omelettes, both were average at best. Their bread is good, and the breakfast potatoes were average. 

As if it couldnt get worse, the dining room had a smell of sewage. Seemed to be a plumbing issue, the last smell you want at breakfast. 

Skip this over-rated dump and go to a place that smells like good food and treats their customers with respect and dignity."}
{"text":"Sick of the modern and hip breakfast joints popping up around the valley who serve portion sizes meant for 6 year olds? Wondering why the hell there is kale and quinoa on your plate at a meal meant for bacon and more bacon? 

Then rejoice, your wallet and appetite will be overjoyed at this little gem that recognizes the importance of having a breakfast so hearty and fulfilling, you'll sweat nervously - maybe even painfully - at the thought of lunch. 

I admit, I am not a true breakfast lover. I eat breakfast at 1:30 PM because I try to avoid the crowd and wait time. Definitely not because I just woke up half an hour before. Yet, I could definitely forgo a burger to come to this place. There are 20 different omelets to satisfy your picky self and when the plates come, you barely have anymore room left on your table to make sure your Tapatio bottle is safe and sound, ready at the go. Potatoes are thick and crisp, and omelets are stuffed like your grandma would have made it.

Service can be a little nonexistent with the girls running around from table to table but it seems like a lot of regulars come so it doesn't bother either party. Definitely, would recommend this place either really early in the day to avoid a wait, or wait until an hour before closing. Beware though, that if you choose the latter - you'll probably be sweating a little while you eat during the Arizona heat. While The Farmhouse has kept most of it's old school decor and charm indoors, it also just happens to have kept the fact that air conditioning is almost non-existent when the place is at capacity. 

For Crackers lovers - this just may be THE contender."}
{"text":"Great typical American breakfast resturant, great staff and delicious food. I like how they keep serving coffee. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times, but it's not because I don't love it, it's because there is always a line and I don't feel like waiting!! This place is a classic  \"small town\" diner with a classic look and classic food. The portions are huge. The staff is friendly. The space is confined.

If you can get a table before you gnaw your own arm off, you won't regret coming here. I wish they had more diners like this around the Valley. I could eat here everyday if I had to...and I wasn't afraid of weighing 700lbs.

An interesting tidbit - United Airlines has named this little diner one of the top 25 things to do while in Arizona. That's what got me in the door. The experience, feel and food kept me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome food, too packed.  I'm sorry but I am not going to wait 45mins for breakfast anywhere.  If you go on a weekday, you can usually get right in, but do yourself a favor and avoid this place on a weekend or holiday.

Their food is awesome... very fresh and very tasty, the service is great and always friendly, and the prices are very reasonable.  The decor inside is like an old farm house and very quaint.  Check it out, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Simply the best in town. Great service. Friendly vibe.  I've tried numerous things on the menu. Pancakes, cinnamon roll, meatloaf, omlet, reuben. Yum-E! The only thing I didn't love was the chili."}
{"text":"Their coffees are pretty good and their desserts are very tasty. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Parking can be a little bit of a pain in the butt."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. They generally have a wait, but it is worth it. The scrambles are good here and very large, but not as good as the restaurant next door. The one thing that is really delicious here is the biscuits with chipped beef gravy. I've never seen this served anywhere else and it is amazing. It is so tasty, I could put that gravy on anything (though that may cause me a delicious gravy heart attack). If for nothing else, I would come here for that."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had a good breakfast sandwich (NYC and London were the last places) so to discover The Farmhouse Restaurant in downtown Gilbert is great news for my weekend mornings. Yes you have to wait at the weekend, but believe me it's SO worth it. I like the breakfast at Liberty Market and a few Good Eggs around the valley but this place beats them all. 
P.S If you love bacon you will be VERY happy!"}
{"text":"Breakfast chow was okay, but the friendly service was tarnished by 1) no menu 2) failure to meet my order and 3) no effort to ask, \"How's your breakfast?\"

PROS: they had egg whites instead of Egg Beaters, which was better than having to do regular eggs; turkey sausage was also available, but the flavor was meh; hash browns were very good--crispy outside, soft inside; neat establishment in Old Town Gilbert, w/ high ceilings, wood floors, etc. Staff were friendly, but . . .  

CONS:  received a cheerful, \"Sit wherever you want!\", then waited for a menu. Five minutes passed, and I was offered a beverage. When the drink was delivered, I was asked for my order. Ummm . . . I waived off the menu and placed an ala carte request.  I also asked if they had salsa. The response was a cheerful, \"Yes and it's homemade! It's good!\"  My plate arrived -- I never saw any salsa . . . nor my waitress for that matter, until it was time to deliver the bill (albeit with a cheerful demeanor, which I did appreciate). My last rant? The 70s music piped into the dining area. I hate Chicago--always have. The follow-on dose of Boston and The Spinners did not improve the ambiance for me . . . The silver lining? The theme from \"Shaft\" came on as I was about to leave! \"He's one bad mutha f-- . . . Shut yo mouth! . . . I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft! . . . We can dig it!\" I stayed and listened. Then made a hasty exit as the radio segued to Kansas. YUCK!

The Farmhouse is a neat looking place, and the chow is satisfactory, but my service was lacking.  Lastly, the tunes were like fingernails on a chalboard to me (w/ one notable exception).  I think I'll try another establishment next time I am in town.

Cheers!

{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend.  I was practically raised in Gilbert and had no idea this charming little place existed.  Located right in the heart of downtown Gilbert (as if it's that big right?! :P), it is just a few steps away from the water tower and other local favorites.  We went on late morning on a Sunday and had to wait 10-15 min., which gave us time to catch up and chat.

I ordered the Spinach, bacon, and cheese omelette with a heaping side of home fries.  The omelette was gigantic and very delicious, filled to the top with spinachy, bacony, and cheesy goodness that I even had to take some of it home!  Overall the atmosphere is very characteristic of Old Town Gilbert: quaint and idyllic with a touch of Western charm.

I'll have to stop by again whenever I'm back at home."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Farmhouse Restaurant this morning.  

I had some kind of egg scramble with:  asparagus, spinach, sundried tomato, and cheese.  It was pretty good.

My wife had a belgian waffle with fruit.  

This is a good breakfast place.  It reminds me of a place in Chicago (Logan Square area) where I am originally from called Lula's.  

The food was good for breakfast."}
{"text":"Glad we stopped here before flying back to Dallas.  I ordered a \"famous\" cinnamon roll and it was very good.  I wish I hadn't offered to share with the table!  It was buttery and soft, nothing like a cinnabon or something out of a can.  I had the hamburger and it was made with fresh produce including the juiciest tomato slice ever, you can't find one like that at Wal-Mart.  The guys liked their omelettes, fluffy and full of quality incredients.  My burger bun was made in house too, almost like a brioche, yum!  Mom didn't enjoy the waffle, it was a little too soft for her, but otherwise we all enjoyed."}
{"text":"A very charming little place with a wonderful staff! The food is delicious, and as a coffee snob.. zero complaints in that department. I had the biscuits & gravy with and egg ( over easy ) I wasn't disappointed. I'll be coming back to try the large array of omelettes next time! They looked amazing!"}
{"text":"What can I say but \"Meh\".
 
A friend and I shared the special omelet of the day which had jalapenos, corn, black beans, avocado, green chile, bacon and cheese in it.  It was huge and more than enough to share.  But it wasn't particularly tasty.  The bacon was overcooked and greasy, and I actually like my bacon very well done!  The jalapenos either weren't in it or had no taste and the green chile was bland. That baby should have had a huge scoop of fresh pico de gallo to accompany it to give it some flavor! The breakfast potatoes were almost burnt and tasted like they had been cooked in old grease that remained behind to coat them!  The wheat toast was actually a soft long wheat roll, cut in half and toasted -- not tasty at all and I don't want \"soft\" toast!  The coffee was good and the service was attentive.  Based on the quality of that meal, I wouldn't go back .. I'd eat next door at Liberty Market instead!"}
{"text":"Farmhouse has been a staple in the downtown Gilbert area for years, even before it became the \"hip\" place to be. Don't let the long wait times get you down! They usually over estimate how long it will be. Once inside, the place is small and cozy and feels like eating breakfast over at your grandparents' house. They don't have quite the selection of a breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's but when it comes to the basics (pancakes, French toast, bacon and omelettes) they are masters. We went there this morning and after a 30 minute wait (not bad at all), we were treated to great food and service the whole way. Only piece of advice would be to keep the group small. Having more than 5 or 6 in your party really makes the wait a lot longer."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and delicious! Huge portions, i mean huge. I ordered the bacon, sausage, green chili and sour cream omelet  ($19 from a list of 25). Eggs were fluffy and perfect. The side potatoes are very good and the toast was unique. Even the coffee was in a very large mug. And.. .the price was very readonable. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the better breakfast spots I've been to in Arizona. The decor was like country sheik and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive.

Both times I've ordered the veggie omelet and was happy to see they used fresh spinach and other fresh vegetables. It was very tasty. Most importantly (for me) nothing was super greasy. 

The wait time to be seated can be a bit much if you're totally starving. I'd go back on a very early weekend morning or a weekday to avoid the masses."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Birthday Breakfast at the Farm house restaurant in Gilbert . The egg white bacon mushroom green onion cheddar cheese omelette was amazing the hash browns were a delight and the French bread buttered toast from the grill was so yummy. My daughter had a BLT and I have never seen one with so much bacon :) we have eaten here before and have never been disappointed. The restaurant is always clean and the waitress was so nice and attentive we couldn't be happier with our meal"}
{"text":"After our experience, I'm not sure we will be going back.  Over priced food, especially considering the service.  

If the service is great I don't mind paying more for even average food, but when you have to ask for things repeatedly and you're ignored, it's not worth it.

There are too many other options for breakfast in the valley then to settle for this place.

Maybe we just had a bad waitress, but I'm not willing to go back and spend my hard earned money to try it again."}
{"text":"I usually am not out for brunch, but a visiting friend really (like serious bruncher) wanted a good meal, so we hit up Google for suggestions. Ended up here with really lovely service and yummy food. Loved
the whole atmosphere. Try the biscuits and gravy and cinnamon rolls. So. Good."}
{"text":"A fantastic spot for breakfast!  (Lunch is pretty good too!)  Fresh ingredients always make every dish a home run.  The staff is so warm - make you feel like part of the family.  The restaurant is located on a picturesque, old-time, americana, main street in Gilbert, AZ.  The line is usually long on weekend mornings, but it is always worth the wait.  Great food, authentic country atmosphere, homey-friendly service - it doesn't get any better than this in the Metro Phoenix area."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, BAD FOOD. I never write reviews but this was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant to date. The waitress never came over. I had to get up to refill my own coffee. I had to get up to ask for the check, I had to bring her my card. The place wasn't even busy. We were so excited to try this place and were extremely disappointed. I got the pancakes, eggs, and a cafe au latte and my mom got the ham, potatoes, and toast with a coffee. Nothing was exceptional. The ham was bad with gross parts in it. The pancakes were so DRY. 
Long story short: OVERRATED and the worst service I've had at any restaurant anywhere in my life. Go to Snooze a few doors down, waaayyyy better I promise."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding in terms of food and service.  After breakfast my wife and I shared a cinnamon roll. Hands down it was the best roll of this type we have ever had.  What a great way to top off our breakfast and last cup of coffee.  If in the area you must stop by and enjoy a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Very good food! The service was slow,  but the waitress was friendly.  She obviously has her regulars and takes the time to chat with them which puts delays on service.  I wasn't in a rush so it was cool to watch.  I probably wouldn't stop in if I just wanted a good quick meal though.  Back to the food.  My omelette was amazing.  I had the #20 which was an avocado omelette.  It had bacon,  avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. Perfectly cooked.  Bacon was crispy and delicious.  The potatoes to me were just okay.  The coffee was rich and flavorful.  Perfect.  My son had the chocolate chip pancakes.  There is no kids menu,  so it was two huge pancakes.  I had one boxed to go.  No kids menu is a huge downer.  The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed. Decor was cute.  I'd go back.  Perhaps by myself with a book though."}
{"text":"I can never get enough farmhouse.. everything is to die for. Their scrambles are amazing, wonderful biscuits and gravy and home fries you'll sell secrets for.. try the papa stack sandwich! Oh la la.. the service is always pleasurable and the atmosphere is nice, clean, tidy AND homey...I would eat here daily if given the chance.."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place around! Food is amazing and not generic at all. Breakfast tacos rule! Also great drinks - bloody Mary's and mimosas. Final part of a great restaurant is superior service, which Farmhouse certainly has and then some,"}
{"text":"For my 100th review, I selected the restaurant that had been on my bookmark list the longest, The Farmhouse, and decided to give it a try and write a review. I don't even remember who originally recommended it to me or why I have had it on my list since 2009 but it had been a while since my husband and I had tried anywhere new for breakfast so we were both looking forward to the experience. 

After reading the Yelp reviews of the long wait times, we did our best to get there early but it is a bit of a drive for us so I think it was actually close to 9am by the time we got our names on the list. I was dismayed by the number of people outside waiting in the hot sun but they went thru the names pretty quickly (helped along by the fact that more than one group had apparently given up and gone elsewhere) so we got seated in about 15 minutes. Not too bad for prime breakfast-eating time on a Saturday morning. 

We both ordered coffee which we agreed was really good. I got a muffin to hold me over which was definitely homemade but had obviously been reheated in a microwave which is a pet peeve of mine (I don't want to burn the roof of my mouth on a muffin unless it is fresh from the oven). I really liked the fact that every omelet on their long list could also be ordered as a scramble. I got the one with the salsa since I like a spicy breakfast and they were nice enough to substitute a cup of fruit for the toast. My hubby got his favorite breakfast, steak and eggs. When our food came we both agreed that it was good but bland. My egg dish was tasty but not spicy in the least and his steak was prepared to his specifications but he said it tasted like it had no seasoning on it whatsoever. The potatoes were the same, cooked well but I had to drown them in ketchup since they were so devoid of flavor. 

We both thought the service was great and liked the atmosphere of the place. The decor is very shabby chic. Our waitress was super friendly. She never neglected our coffee or water glasses but we also did not feel rushed. When she first brought out my plate without the fruit, she noticed the mistake before I even had to point it out and had it corrected within seconds. I do agree with other reviewers that the portion sizes are way too large - I ate less than half my food so I do think they could give you less and hopefully charge less and I'd be happier. 

We ended up going to the farmer's market next door afterwards and so we had a very nice morning in downtown Gilbert.  But overall, I would not really classify this as a destination restaurant. I think if it was closer to us we would definitely be back but it really just isn't worth the drive for such boring food.  We both enjoyed the meal but you can basically get the same thing at the Good Egg down the street."}
{"text":"One of the best truly local breakfast restaurants I have been to. The belgian waffle was very good as was the chorizo green chili omelette.  Be sure to go early if you want breakfast as the place is very small.  Not sure I would wait outside like most, but I will be back, early in the AM to insure a good seat and some of there yummy food!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is here, the omelettes were the only enticing item on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!!  Everything was fresh & hot. Veggie scramble special was loaded with spinach, crisp broccoli, zucchini, red peppers & mushrooms. Added chorizo. Generous portions."}
{"text":"I've lived nearby in Gilbert for a few years, but I have only been to the FarmHouse for breakfast. Every time I have gone, I've never been disappointed. I like the country homestyle cooking and theme of the restaurant - complete with wooden floors and good cooking. 

I order the biscuits and gravy, sunnyside up eggs and bacon and orange juice. Best I've ever tasted and it sure keeps me coming back for more. Family members all order different things and it always keeps them happy and craving it every morning until we all go out for breakfast!

The wait can be long, but it's always proven to be worth it to me. They will seat only groups with all the members there for quicker service to other groups, and sitting under the misters on benches in a shaded area makes waiting easier."}
{"text":"Very small, very popular breakfast spot in historic Gilbert. They feature quite the variety of omelets (which can also be done as scrambled eggs) and an option to create your own combination. The omelets are huge and fluffy, home fries are perfectly spiced and not greasy, and the whole wheat French bread is an interesting touch (think wheat Texas toast).

The coffee was very good as well.

Service was quick after the short wait to get in. The food was fresh and fast, and even though others were waiting to get in, we weren't rushed out the door. We didn't linger, but we didn't feel unwelcomed to stay, either.

Quaint atmosphere, excellent food, outstanding service, and reasonable prices. Only downside I can see is the poor availability of parking, but that's not the fault of the restaurant.

We'll be back next time we're in the East Valley around breakfast time."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites for breakfast.  They are always busy though, and the dining room is small, so be prepared to wait outside for a table.  Not a big deal unless you're pressed for time or its summer.

The service is friendly and fast, and I've been recognized by the servers even after not being in for many months... and they wanted to know where we'd been! :)

I usually get some kind of scramble/omelet and have never been disappointed.  Potatoes and toast are delicious, too! When I bring my daughter, they make her a Mickey Mouse shaped pancake and she loves it. I've been wanting to try the cinnamon roll for a long time, but I'm always too stuffed by the end of breakfast to order it. Bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a line out the door, and for good reason! The food is delish and the atmosphere is quaint. I got the bacon, avocado, tomato omelet and my hubby got French toast. Both were wonderful. The waitress said I could have mine as an omelet or a scramble, and I opted for a scramble. That's probably an option for any omelet on the menu. 

Don't let the line scare you. We put our name on the list and checked back in 10 minutes and had our table 5 minutes after that. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It has been soooooo long since I've had good breakfast. First off, the hostress is super friendly. When we first sat down, I ordered their Fresh Squeeze Orange Juice and it tastes absolutely fresh. Their coffee tastes so smooth with no after bitter taste and all different types of creamer you can think of in the middle of the table. 

Since this is my first time I didn't know what else to order, I've noticed many tables ordered Waffles. I ordered myself one of those and its sooo sooo fluffy and delicious. Even though it is a small size restaurant and it isn't very decorative, I will come here again, again and again."}
{"text":"Don't forget to put your name on the list outside the front door!  We loved the atmosphere, it's a tiny little place with a true Farmhouse feel.  We went on a Sunday morning and the wait was fairly short.  It only took about 5 minutes for our food to come out.  I got the bacon and sausage scramble with sausage gravy added.  The sausage gravy is some of the best I have had, it is a little sweet which was new for me but there was plenty of sausage, pepper and flavor.  The potatoes were decent, they had plenty of seasoning.  The grilled french bread seemed a bit strange for a breakfast bread but hey you can get whatever bread you want.  We will definitely be back, we love the Gilbert \"old town\" feel and this breakfast is on our list of ones to remember."}
{"text":"First off, if you plan on eating here make sure you get in before 8, otherwise you will have to wait 30 min to an hour.  The seating is small in this place, but the food is good and it comes out quickly.  We have been twice and the first we came at 9am, that was a mistake as it took us some time to get a seat.  Second time we were smarted and got in at 7:30 and sat right down.  After you order, the food gets to you within 5-10 minutes which I definitely enjoyed.  Omeletes are good and nice portion.  Pricing for 2 is about $25-30 bucks depending on what you get.  Isn't an every weekend type place for us, but once a month we like to come here for the food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I had the two eggs scrambled with home fries and sourdough bread.  The home fries were great. We went during the week so was not crowded."}
