{"text":"Tonight was the first time I have ever walked out of a restaurant because the food was taking so long.  After waiting an hour, numerous tables received orders ahead of us who had arrived after we were seated.  Manager did not show up to talk with us after waiter said he would. We have eaten here many times and enjoyed the food. This might be our last visit.  Management showed no interest in even talking to us."}
{"text":"Since my last review,  I went back twice! Lol! I just can't get enough! Their margaritas are huge! The mix is pre-made, but I still taste a strong shot of what seemed like José Cuervo.  The food was delicious and plentiful as always. I also like the fact that it is family owned, and you are served and catered by Hispanics. It makes it way more authentic. Once again the CHURROS are violently good. They make you want to slap your mama (just don't though :)) I love the Mexican Music,  and the comforting and relaxed yet colorful atmosphere. Great family oriented place for sure!"}
{"text":"The Margarona is the truth! You get your money worth on there alcoholic drinks. Food is pretty Gd to."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you miss Los Hab, this is a great new option. I had a cauliflower and potato chimichanga that was awesome. They are super fast, super friendly. It's right next to the theater and there are vegetarian options, delicious steak fajitas and Negro Modelo for mom!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight with family.    Will definitely visit again.  free chips and salsa very good;   Husband had steak fajitas; son had pork tacos.  both very good.  Stared with the tortilla soup and quesadilla; yum!  Losing a star because margueritas (which should be huge for a mexican place) very basic  too commercial for my taste (although points for half off happy hour on a Saturday!)"}
{"text":"Mexican food is hard to find in Cleveland and Senor Tequila provides that quick fix you need. I ordered the pork-tips enchiladas (called something else, but I can't recall!), and an order of the churros and sopapillas. The enchiladas were a sizable portion, and decent but I felt the enchiladas were a little dry and the sauce was rather bland. The dessert options were great though, definitely a nice note to end the night!   One thing that stood out was the amazing customer service. I'm assuming it was the manager who visited our table during our meal and afterwards making sure we all enjoyed our food and had a nice time. Though the food was mediocre, we will definitely be returning just because of the welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and could not have been more pleased with our experience! The food and service were outstanding! So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"We found this gem near the place we were staying and was impressed!  The food was delicious and the service was fast and speedy.  The guacamole was some of the best we have had.  The portions were a little large for us. Ut that just meant that we could have leftovers later!  I had the jumbo burrito with shredded chicken.  The chicken had a lot of flavor.  The burrito was so good and had the rice and beans on the inside.  If we lived closer, I would make this a frequent stop for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the margaritas are HUGE!  This is the best Mexican food I've had in Cleveland (so far) and I LOVE Mexican food."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, and the location is quite convenient. However, I ordered the Azteca steak, and I must say that it was the worst Mexican food I have ever had. The meat was completely inedible, and was tough and chewy. It certainly wasn't a ribeye like it claimed to be, and I shuddered to think of what kind of meat it really was. The refried beans were watery and soupy. The only edible thing on my plate was the onions. My daughter ordered a quesadilla and taco, which were both fine. I Never order the Azteca beef, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, friendly restaurant where the fairly typical Mexican offerings are prepared and served with care and skill. The atmosphere is relaxed and the decor colorful but not garish. The food was really good and flavorful, and the prices make it a great value. Margaritas were huge and delicious. A great addition to Shaker Heights."}
{"text":"Service could of been more cordial yet their speed made up for it. Feature-appetizer's quality was fresh yet lacked taste. Fajitas were a hit and portion was generous for one, perfect for two. Washroom cleanliness is a problem. Nice outdoor terrace. Adequate pay parking. Reasonably priced for the quality. Nicer corner of town, well positioned right next to theatre. Overall, our experience was fair. We wouldn't avoid this restaurant but unsure if anything made enough of an impression to make us want to seek it out once again."}
{"text":"The food was good! The service was great and our server was very friendly! I'll be back for more fundido! I LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"So, absolutely the worst restaurants experience ever.  So I am not talking about the food, we never got to try it.  But the experience was bad enough I will never, ever go back unless it is under different management.  First, it was Cinco de Mayo, so we expected it to be busy. So as soon as they opened I called and made reservations.  6:30 sharp.  So we showed up early just because we expected a little delay.  So when we showed up, we were informed that they would not honor the reservation on CdM.  But, it would only be a half hour.  So we waited.  45 minutes later, we here the wait is an hour.  So just another 15 minutes.  Hahahshaha  So, 1.5 hours we are told that they felt really bad.  They weren't going to do anything about it, but they felt bad.    So now we are past that point of no return.  They come out and tell us they are clearing the table.  10 minutes after that they tell us they 3 tables had paid, but were not leaving.   Finally we get to sit.  We place the first frozen Margarita order.  It is going to be all good.  NOPE!!!!  No more frozen Margaret's.  Too bad.    So at this point we just get up and leave.  There was no sorry, no please come back, no have a drink on us.  Just a sorry, we are busy.  So in case you are wondering, no a manager never came out.  No one apologized, except for the hostess telling us how embarrassed she was.  So never again."}
{"text":"I came here again and had a much worse experience than the first time. First, there was a piece of charcoal or burnt wood or something in our complementary basket of chips. I'm sure it was an honest mistake, so we just took it out and kept eating the chips. It just makes you wonder, what else could accidentally make it into your food at this place.   Also, our waiter was rude and impatient with us for some reason. My friend who was with us has a habit of just asking the waiter what he recommends when it's time to take the orders, and I see how that can be irritating if the waiter is in a rush or something. But when my friend asked for a recommendation, the waiter gave a big sigh and eye roll like this was some HUGE inconvenience. The same friend can be a little indecisive too and was having trouble deciding on a margarita, and the waiter was like eye rolling all over the place instead of giving my friend guidance. It just seemed like this guy HATED our table for some reason and didn't even try to hide it.   The food was good, but greasier than I remember it being last time. The margarita was good, but once again was light on the tequila. Overall, I won't be coming back. I'd rather go to eat somewhere where I don't feel like my existence is a huge inconvenience to the waiter."}
{"text":"We strayed from our usually Mexican restaurant to try Señor Tequilas.... The staff was very friendly and the food was good.  But the service was so slow and they weren't busy.  We will probably try this place again."}
{"text":"Really poor quality.  The food was some sort of weird ersatz Mexican.  It was poorly prepared and poorly served.  The decor is colorful dreary.  Not conducive to even having an appetite.  The service was sullen.  Even though it is not expensive, it is not worth the little you pay! Avoid at all costs.  Given that Shaker Square is noted for good food, I predict it will not be around for long.  It might work better in a less demanding area?"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio! Wonderful drinks, good food and amazing service. Arturo our waiter was a lot of fun. We are already planning our next weekend back here."}
{"text":"Excited that there's a new place to eat around Shaker Square. Admittedly I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised at how great the food and service was. Started with a small lime margarita, which for $4.99 was not small at all (the medium is huge - see pic). It wasn't one of those pre-made mixes, and it wasn't too sweet and adequately strong. Free chips and homemade salsa (at least it tasted homemade) were a nice addition.  I had the authentic tacos - carnitas, steak, and chorizo (one of each). In a corn tortilla as expected. The chorizo was my favorite and the steak was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order again. The pork was a little over done but still tasty. The bf had the Durango burrito which was awesome. I would pay a lot of money for a vat of the cheese sauce they put on top.   The service was excellent - super attentive. I'm excited to come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Seriously a great place for margaritas and cheap Mexican food. The atmosphere is perfect for coming to unwind after a long day or week. Definitely try their mango margaritas. Birthday celebrations here are also a must! The wait time for food on busy nights can be a little lengthy but they usually keep your chips and salsa refilled while you wait. It's always a good idea to know what you want before coming on a busy night and order ASAP. The waiters/waitresses are always accommodating when it comes to split the bill/drinks but I would have an idea of how you want to do it before they come - to make it easier on them."}
{"text":"About what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area. A combination of authentic dishes and American- adapted favorites. Quickly greeted with warm chips and salsa. Always easy to get a seat. The interior is colorful and clean. Good service. Happy to see a local business like this doing well. Had the you- pick combo with a burrito and quesadilla, and another entree was a Chipotle chicken traditional dish. Very moderately priced. This is our go- to restaurant for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Slowest Mexican place I've ever been. My carnitas enchiladas came and by the time I got to the third one it had 2 tiny pieces of meat maybe the size of a marble. We waited over a hour for pure disappointment"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked through the door, we were greeted by warm inviting colors and a hostess who complimented my boyfriend and I... ..maybe a little too friendly, lol. The server was friendly and the salsas were delicious -very yummy/crunchy tortilla chips.  the drinks were pretty big and delicious. We were pleasantly surprised and I felt special:)"}
{"text":"I ordered chile rellenos.  Came with grease and brown gravy.  Also ordered off appetizer menu, came with dry rice and bean sauce masquerading as refried beans.  I paid for the mess but could not eat it.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"ORDER THE CHURROS!!!!  That is the biggest thing I would recommend... we are still talking about and salivating over the dessert.  These cinnamon-sugar coated sticks from heaven came out surrounding a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and everything was drizzled with chocolate and strawberry sauces.  The plate looked lovely, but what was even more delightful was the surprise when we bit into the churros.  They were filled with a silky smooth custard!  Literally would not have cared if the rest of my meal was a disaster, that's how delicious the dessert was!  My meal, however, was NOT a disaster.  I ordered the chicken chimichangas, and they came out covered in a generous helping of guac and sour cream but still managed to have a crispy tortilla surrounding the flavorful chicken filling.  The Mexican rice was flavorful, which is something I don't usually find in many restaurants, so I was pleased with that as well.    The service was good... I never had an empty glass.  I really liked the decor as well- fun chairs carved with animals and color EVERYWHERE!"}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch and left regretful and upset. What was supposed to be a relaxing lunch date with my sons left me angry, annoyed and anxious! After being seated, our waiter appeared and quickly asked if we were ready to order. I asked if we could have a FEW minutes. He quickly disappeared, later came back with water glasses and that's where his attentiveness ended.   The waiter from the neighboring table brought us complimentary chips and salsa and I saw that guy more through our entire meal than our waiter and felt bad the few times I stopped him to ask questions. Anyway, I'm thinking our waiter would be back in 5-10 minutes but actually didn't see him for at least another 20 minutes. Now mind you, that I used to be a waitress in a former life so I'm trying to be calm and understanding, having experienced \"being in the weeds\" on several Saturday nights; but it was 1p on a Saturday afternoon with the restaurant at 30% capacity, at most. When he finally returned for our order it was so rushed, I didn't get a chance to order our drinks and specify NO GUAC on any of the plates. I decided to chalk the margarita vs sangria choice I was trying to make and the boys Mexican sodas but had to wave down the fore mentioned waiter to ask for my waiter.  After a few minutes, another guy appeared asking how he could help because my waiter \"step out for a moment.\" After making my request, we didn't see our waiter again ( and couldn't clarify if the message was received) until he walked by us, with OUR meals in hand to address ANOTHER table. Weird/unsanitary , I thought, to have other people breathes around others food. He made his way back to us with our meals ( no GUAC thankfully) and asked if everything was ok before disappearing again. The food was nothing special. I got the Texas fajita, my oldest son the steak lunch fajita and the youngest the kids cheese quesadilla. The most delicious thing on any plate was the refried beans and that's saying a lot. Everything else lacked seasoning and favor.  After clearly finishing our meals, even giving the unmistakable universal sign by moving all our half eaten, ready for boxes plates to one end of the table, it took another 15-20 minutes for our server to come by and ask if we needed anything. I specifically asked for boxes, 1 churro and flan and the check. He returned when the desserts were ready with only those. He then asked if I would like boxes and bags. I said yes please, along with the check. He came back a few minutes later with several boxes, started boxing a plate then stopped and disappeared; still no check. Now, I'll give them that they're desserts are big but again, nothing special. The churro were ok. The flan...smh... The bottom layer was clearly burnt and separated from the rest. My oldest tasted it and was disgusted and the youngest didn't even touch his.   After another 10 minutes of waiting, I was fed up and went to find my waiter as he was \"just printing your check now.\" Of course when he finally hands me my check, there are items on there that I didn't order. I immediately ask him to correct it and ran my card. I wanted so badly to leave a 15% or less tip but I knew he would relate it to something else (me) instead of his abominable service. Long story short, it was my first and likely my last time."}
{"text":"Each time we've been here it has been a great experience! The staff have always been friendly and attentive, and the food comes out super quick! Usually we barely have time to make a dent in the chips and salsa that automatically comes out before our food arrives at the table. My usual favorite is the Chori Pollo, and it's delicious! The chicken and some kind of ground sausage come in this delicious creamy-cheesy sauce. Woah.   The location is also great! It's right next door to the Shaker Square Cinemas so whenever we go see a movie we eat here before or after. Parking is a bit of a nightmare though."}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor, the atmosphere, the food! the service, it's all great. Cleveland has literally no Mexican restaurants and this one is my go to. I know it's not exactly authentic but it's so good. The service is always so friendly too. Plus, their prices are great!!"}
{"text":"This place is just great. They offer great food at a reasonable price. It is certainly a cut above your typical Mexican restaurant. The entrees are really good - the ceviche is top shelf and the chori pollo is great.  We have been here multiple times now and have been pleased every time.    And I can confirm that the Churo is awesome!"}
{"text":"We discovered Señor Tequila on SkipTheDishes, and two deliveries and one visit later, we are definitely fans.  Prices are pretty low; most entrees are in the $10-$15 range for a lot of food, and delivery is only $5, which is a fair price to pay for not having to leave the house.  The tacos are our favorite so far. Chicken, carnitas and steak have all been excellent. They come with rice and beans, both of which are better than average. They also come with very good guacamole as well as sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and pico. Other hits have been the pork chili verde and the shredded beef chimichanga. Oh, and I can't forget about the queso fundido; it's slightly spicy, full of chorizo and overall the cheesy perfection you'd hope it to be. The margaritas are delicious, definitely made from som thing better than Cuervo, and reasonably priced, especially if you order a pitcher.  Being from western states made me a bit of a Mexican food snob, so I'm pretty sure excited to find a delicious option not too far from my house here in an Ohio suburb. I'll definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Dont eat here! The chicken tacos were bland with no flavor. The margaritas were juice. The service was horrid. We had to ask to pay our bill."}
{"text":"The first time I  ate from Senor Tequilas i ordered over the phone, and I had somehow looked at a different senor tequilas and orderd a vegetable quesedilla, which was delicious. On my return visit I was hoping for another vegetable quesedilla, I sat at the bar placed my order and was told they dont make them, so i left and called it in and recieved the same answer, stating we never served those. Still not sure what the hack was to get that quesedilla  but with a limited vegetarian option on the menu, you would think tossing vegetables in a tortilla would be easy to do occasionally. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, margaritas from the way they were flying over the counter must be delicious."}
{"text":"Would have given a higher review if the chicken quesadilla was better (beans in a quesadilla?).  Also disappointed when I asked for black beans and got refried beans. Otherwise I was satisfied (order was95% right)."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!! Best Mexican in the Cleveland area that I have found. We had the pollo crema and chimichangas, they were both excellent!"}
{"text":"The Burrito Durango (chicken, steak and shrimp + grilled peppers, tomato and mushrooms) hit the spot!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this gem in Shaker Square.  The place itself its comfortable, cute, spacious and not a hole in the walk time of place but still comfortingly casual.  I had the loca chimichanga topped with queso and stuffed with chicken and shrimp.  Was delicious as was the side of rice and beans.  The chicken was slightly oversalted for my taste but I still really enjoyed me meal.  The queso deserves its own shout out.  I could that queso with chips every day.  I'm so glad to have this place so close by."}
{"text":"Seriously good salsa is my immediate gauge for being able to tell if Mexican food is going to be good. It did not disappoint. Our carne asada was fine. Beans were awesome. Best of all was my mango margarita. The service was impeccable. Groupon was down and after freaking out about it not working for 10 minutes at the end of our meal, the owner came over to talk to us and was super understanding and kind. We appreciated that so much that we'll most certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. They were supposed to close at 11:00, but we came in at 10:50 and they stayed open suggesting tequilas and food to us all night. The food was amazing and the service was the best I have had in Cleveland in the 4 years I have lived here. Absolutely recommend!!! Please go for take out, dine in, or anywhere in between!!!!"}
{"text":"Good spot for your standard Tex-mex fare. Nice combo options get you a taste of the menu. Good margaritas too!"}
{"text":"First time here and thanks to Carlos who made fresh margaritas and the food all  was excellent. This is a must come again spot. Food was hot and FRESH  Prices great and drinks tasty. This place is a hit"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! You get a lot of food for what you order and it's better than most Mexican restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Visiting from Chicago and staying right in shakers square and wanted Mexican. It was equivalent to a fast food Mexican place. I got the lunch special taco salad with beef and it was extremely greasy...the salad looked like soup. My brother got the quesadilla and taco. Again nothing special. I'm giving t three stars for the salsa and chips which were actually good and the server was nice."}
{"text":"This may be some of the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten.  I had a shrimp quesadilla that was laden in grease and prepared with something akin to Cheez Whiz.  My friend who is vegan, and made it explicitly clear with examples, received her guacamole with sour cream in it!  Furthering the vegan experience she asked for the chef to come up with something special which came in the form of a bean burrito, a bean enchilada and a plop of beans as a side dish...just in case.  Tasteless and not very original.  The margarita could have doubled as sugar water and was brimming with ice.  Unfortunately, our waiter was not very helpful and, needless to say, we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and there was no wait at all for a table.  That's as far as the good service went.  Waited a very long time for both appetizers and meals.  Our waitress came to our table exactly once.  We couldn't even order a second round of drinks because no one ever came back to the table to take our order. The food was OK but that's about the only positive thing I can say.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We recently moved to cleveland heights and after a day of unpacking we decieded to get something delivered.. checking out the trusty grubhub app we settled on mexican and ordered form Senor Tequila... The queso dip for was smaller then expected but had great flavor.. The chicken tacos were out of this work.. probably some of the best mexican chicken i have ever had. Sweet and spicy with the right amount of kick, fill with lettuce and tomatoes. Would order 10 of these next time as my dinner.. Then we both go the loca chimichungas. Mine was with out the mushroom, my fiance had hers with. They tasted amaizing .. Lots of shrimp and chicken. The rice was cooked well and the lettuce and sour cream was fresh. Cant wait to actually eat at the location!"}
{"text":"I like to keep it simple when i come here. Tacos (chicken or steak) Quesadilla (chicken or steak), and nachos. It hasn't failed me so far and the food hits the spot."}
{"text":"In a hip neighborhood with restaurants named Fire, Sasa and Zanzibar, Senor Tequila sounds out of place. But the only thing you'll hate is the name. The food is GREAT - I've had the Fajitas and several kinds of tacos. I've been with family (children 9 & 11) and friends and they easily accommodate both. It is well-above-average, savory Mexican food. Great steak. Solid chorizo. Accommodating staff. One knock is that some ethnic drinks (ie. horchata) are not on the menu every day, which I found odd. But it's great to have them in the Square, despite the chain-restaurant name."}
{"text":"Above average for your classic Mexican place. Good food....some seafood in the menu (eg seafood ceviche entree) I want to come back and try. We got the tacos and the fajitas...nothing special but still pretty good.  Service was great.. Very attentive and nice. Drinks were great.....the margaritas are huggeee and worth the price.  Decor is cute. They have TVs and a fire place inside. Would def come here next time I'm craving Mexican."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find this place about a year ago, as it was a step above most of the traditional Mexican restaurants in the area. I talked it up to all of my friends, and have been a regular customer for the past year. Unfortunately, on my last visit, everything that I liked about this place seemed to have vanished overnight. Either they have taken some drastic cost-cutting measures, they are under completely new management, or both. The wait staff was no longer attentive or friendly, the delicious salsa had been replaced by a glorified ketchup, and the margaritas tasted like melted lime jello with a splash of grain alcohol. Even after informing our server about the problem with the pitcher of margaritas (seriously, they were nasty), it took over thirty minutes to have a replacement brought out, with an explanation that \"they were trying a new product.\" The replacement was no better, and after another 15 minutes, they somehow managed a drinkable pitcher by actually mixing in some fresh juice, which we were still forced to pay for. The manager justified this by saying that the third pitcher \"used the best tequila\" and \"should have cost $45, but they would generously give it to us for the price of the standard pitcher.\" For all this trouble, my table was comped a churro by the manager. Bad food + bad customer service = won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here so I've been about 20 times. I like the consistency, but the service could really improve. They are very attentive at first, but service quickly drops off. You can't get their attention for refills, more chips/salsa, or the check. It's become very annoying. I'm considering going somewhere else for Mexican..."}
{"text":"Here from out of town and I loved this meal! Chips were warm and the salsa was perfect! I also had the traditional guacamole that was amazing! I ordered number 10 from the lunch menu and it was plenty of food. Hope to come back."}
{"text":"The older male at the register did not great us. We had to ask to be seated. He then showed us to our dirty table and gave us sticky menus, as we walked away. He then returned with chips and salsa and no beverages. At this point we noticed that the floor was also filthy. I then had to call him over to our table to take our drink order. I asked him if everything was ok he responded \"I was doing something on the register. Would you like some water?\" We'd been seated for about 10 minutes, so we decided to leave without ordering. The poor customer service and lack of cleanliness wasn't worth the good food that I'd heard so much about."}
{"text":"A great night out with a few friends!   Max, Mark, Jerry and I went there on a Wednesday night.  Jose served us very smooth not to sour not too sweet margaritas for our refreshments.  My friend Jerry had the awesome Molcajete(with plenty to take home) along with a special mango margarita. The rest of us had generous portions of flavorful tacos &  quesadillas with sides of rice and beans.  Easy parking just behind the theater"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing Mexican drinks and food ! I went here Saturday night in the evening! It had a full bar and also really nice atmosphere . Soon as you are seated the server greets and brings you fresh and warm chips and salsa. The server is very nice attentive and informative. I haven't had really any Mexican food, so I had alot of questions. The server explained and recommend their drinks and food. The margarita itself was very delicious. I got myself a steak fajitas and their food specials. The steak fajitas comes with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. The steak fajitas comes in sizzling and warm in a skittle dish. They also give you a Mexican salad on the side. The food portions are great and the prices are great! The fajitas was so delicious and flavorful. The specials came with shrimp, steak, and chicken in this huge bowl of art! The presentation itself looked amazing but the food and the sauce was even better! That also came with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. The portion was huge and incredibly delicious. The service is really nice and friendly, food is delicious and authentic, and the drinks are really good. You cannot go wrong with this place!"}
