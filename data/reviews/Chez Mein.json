{"text":"Two dollars earns you a bowl of chow mein and an optional generous dab of peanut sauce (a.k.a. melted peanut butter).  During the warmer months they sell the chow mein straight through the window on the street. They also have combos that include chow mein and rolls/dumplings/drinks, but I think they are overpriced.  Never open before 6-ish pm, hardly ever a customer inside. I don't even know if they have a menu.   The chow mein is cooked inside, then kept on a griddle (or a hot plate, whatever), waiting for the customer. Ergo you can get slightly burnt mein or very fresh noodles, depending on customer dynamics.  When drunk, when late, or when simply craving some unhealthy munch, the two dollar chow mein place is the hit with students and local punters.  Expect nothing but a delicious pile of good olde fashioned cheap street grub."}
{"text":"After New Years fireworks in old town, we were desperate to find a place that was open and had a bathroom. Let me tell you, it was difficult. When it's below 0 in Fahrenheit and you have to pee? Yikes.   Anyway, walking down the street. I saw that Chez mien was not only open, but there was literally no one else inside and Chinese restaurants always have bathrooms.   I honestly didn't mean to get the cheapest thing on the very simple menu, but as I had no cash on me, I had to borrow two Canadian bucks from my friend to buy myself some noodles in teriyaki sauce.   Was this the best chow mien of my life? Hell no. Was it the cheapest? Probably. Hey, given that it was less than $2USD, it was actually pretty good. I actually like my chow mien a little crunchy. Also, I didn't know about this famous peanut butter sauce..... it didn't sound very authentic, lol neither does teriyaki.... but idk I went with the teriyaki and I kind of regret it.   I have to go back to try the peanut sauce now. Everything here is cheap. It's definitely not authentic Chinese food, so don't expect something amazing. The chow mien is just noodles with sauce on top.... but maybe next time I'll get some spring rolls or shrimp tempura lol. So random!"}
{"text":"I have been to Montreal 5 times, and I have gotten \"2 Dollar Chow Mein\" 3 times. I know I am heavily biased, but of all of the ideas for street food I have seen: hot dogs, pretzels, BBQ, etc., this is by far the greatest. Chinese food on the street for all the drunken bar-hoppers? Freaking. Brilliant.  Last time I was in Montreal I was staying near McGill downtown and we went bar-hopping in le village gai. We walked nearly 2 km out of our way to get 2 Dollar Chow Mein. Damn was it worth it. Is this gourmet Chinese food? No! But the sauce is peanuty, the dish is hot, the serving is generous for a twonie, and the concept is incredibly novel and brilliant. Chinese food. On the street. Open til 3 am. New York, get your act together and get up on this!!"}
{"text":"Preeetty sure the location has changed. We tried the $2 (not on the menu) option from the lady at the sushi place a few doors down from where google directed us. It was OK.. bucket list kind of deal. Just noodles with peanut butter sauce."}
{"text":"Give me some of that \"peanut butta sauce\"  You probably don't want this if you're not drunk, but otherwise, c'mon I don't care if it sounds gross to you, no one I know doesn't think this shit is delicious once they've tried it. Withhold your reservations, don't be a snob. Just ask to have some of that warm PB poured all over those greasy fried noodles then squirt some Sriracha and Soya sauce on it. Sounds good, no? That'll be 2 bucks."}
{"text":"What's not to love about $2 chow mein? It was in no way restaurant quality noodles, but hey, it tastes good for a good deal so why not. Just one star docked for the sub par food. Bonus: Spoke cantonese to the owner, turns out he knows my hometown hong kong as well. Came over to talk to me and was super nice! (might've given me more noodles, i can't recall) Might've been the best social interaction during that entire drunk night out."}
{"text":"Chez Mein, aka 2$ Chow Mein, is legendary on the Main.  Chez main operates in a tiny space on St. Laurent.  They have enough room for 4-10 people to sit and no bathroom.  There is no menu but rather bristol boards that are brought outside when the drunk rush starts.    The food itself is nothing really special.  It's extremely greasy, \"Chinese\"/Canadian food served on the street.  What makes it special is the fact that you can get a large serving of peanut butter covered chow mein noodles for 2$.  This may not seem like a big deal, but bring someone who's never been after a few drinks and they will be amazed.  The food always seems to \"hit the spot\" after a couple of beers.  Plus, it's vegetarian friendly, so everyone's happy!"}
{"text":"a lot of these reviews claim you need be 'wasted' to enjoy the $2 noodles but I don't agree. Anytime I'm in Montreal I drop in for from peanut butter noodles."}
{"text":"Walked pass it the first night in Montreal and made a note to come back to try this place. After hopping between a few bars, we finally gave this place a try on our third night. Best decision ever! Something so simple but yet so comforting. Loved how crispy the noodles were and how (surprisingly) well balanced the peanut butter sauce made the whole dish. This is my new go-to dunk food and I will definitely try to duplicate this at home."}
{"text":"Okay, I can understand why people say that you probably won't like this place AS MUCH if you're not drunk...but I beg to differ. I liked this place when I was sober and drunk. :D :D  BEST $2 chow mein and eggrolls. Fried noodles with teriyaki or peanut butter sauce and egg rolls...FOR ONLY $2!   When you're drunk and hungry, Chez Mein has you covered. They prepare themselves and they open their large glass windows to a flood of hungry, loud, and drunk pedestrians. It definitely gets crowded after a night of debauchery and for good reason. :)  I appreciated my $2 noodles and egg rolls....while being sober as well as drunk. Thank you, Montreal."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place if I was ever out late on St. Laurent. And I just happened to be on a Tuesday night. Her description of peanut butter + chow mein + $2 = why the hell not? If you're drunk I think I can understand why this might taste better. However, I wasn't. The man had a jar of peanut butter which he spooned melted peanut butter out from. The peanut butter served as the sauce. It made me quite thirsty because it was still a bit thick. The texture was inconsistent - some of the noodles were soft and other bits were a little burnt and crisp. I'd recommend you try it - moreso if you're wasted."}
{"text":"There's not really too much else I can say about Chez Mein.  They have a parody facebook page, equally impassioned camps who either love or hate the peanut (butter) sauce.  Personally, I find the noodles to be a great deal on a very filling end of the evening snack that accommodates the vegetarians and vegans in your group.  When you only have a couple dollars left in your pocket at the end of the evening, it's a great snack that doesn't break the bank.    That being said, I'm a big fan of noodles, so I'll have to stop back some other time to see how their other offerings are."}
