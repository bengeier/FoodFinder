{"text":"If you like good sea food, this is the place! Seriously I crave the crab legs from here! So, so yummy! But be prepared to get a little messy!"}
{"text":"So happy they opened one near our house.    Always busy so plan on a little wait, usually only 15-20 mins or so.   Staff is very friendly and it's a fun place to go."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We order crab boil bucket!! Divine! And the music was fenomenal we will come back!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! Best seafood around. 1st timers & we loved everything we ordered! Fried Clams, Snow Crab Legs & Lobster oh my! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Had the dungeness crab boil  with an add on of sausage. AWESOME wife had shrimp and it was awesome too. Server Steve helped show me how to peel the good stuff out of the crab. On minor problem with dinner is the place is kinda noisy, so either sit close or text each other. We sat  close because I knew it was loud. We will definitely  be back to try more"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Crab was delicious , service was astonishing. The decor of the restaurant was a amazing. We will be back and never go to Kabuki ever again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here; I will definitely be coming back. Demetri took his time to explain the menu thoroughly, and even gave us an opportunity to assist in water conservation by purchasing some tasty grapefruit Santan. His attentiveness to us as well as his hospitable and informative attitude made my party feel welcome. I really enjoyed the food!!! Cajun style is my favorite. King crab, shrimp and mussels were bomb.gov- the vegetables were extremely tasty- the spices, and entire experience was just awesome."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our latest visit to the angry crab shack in Peoria. The food was good and our waitress, Sam, was super friendly and easy to deal with. She quickly filled our order and came by often to check on us."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  Prompt and on time.  Sara was the server and was personable.  She shared her marker with me and I drew a dog on the paper table cloth! Atmosphere was good as it was happy hour and limited patrons."}
{"text":"I love Angry Crabshack! I've been to the other locations and recently moved near this location. Like usual, it doesn't disappoint! Come on? What's more fun than eating out of boil bags and wearing a bib!  The service was on point-like usual and we started with the raw oysters and a bloody mary. After that I went with my usual shrimp tri-fecta with hot spice.   Mid afternoon was the best time to hit this place and happy hour runs from 3-6, so if you can get in at that time go for it!   Another good experience at the Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"Great time tonight at the AC.  It was busy but we were seated soon.  The shrimp and crab were amazing with the trifecta.  We had one that wasn't spicy and one at level 3...which was plenty hot.  The help was fast, friendly and did a great job.  Our guy was Lowan and he did a great job?"}
{"text":"First visit to Angry Crab on 76th and Cactus.  Our server Elicia was knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.  My husband and I had the lobster.  It wasn't great.  The side dishes were good.  We will eat here again but not the lobster.  4 stars for Elicia's excellent service."}
{"text":"This was the tastiest seafood we have probably ever had.  The atmosphere is fun and inviting and every staff member there was positive and upbeat. It was messy, it was fun and a memorable experience. Our server, Davy, was very knowledgable and helpful. This is definitely our new favorite seafood restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a fun and casual seafood experience! Will definitely go back again. Loved the trifecta spice sauce. Messy fun that requires a bib and friends to share the experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, food was bland and nothing like the food along the Louisiana or Texas coast. Crab boil there is ten times better. They try to hard with their decor looks crowded and walls dingy."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun. The drinks are on point, the service was Awesome! The food, the food.......so good! I will be back for sure. Thanks to Shack and Dominic, our servers. You guys really made our experience a great one."}
{"text":"I went twice in a week and invited friends to go again!  I found them on yelp!  I went both times during peak hours on weekdays  w no problem but tried on Friday for a third visit and the line wrapped around outside - here's why!  It's good and it's cheap!  We went hog wild bc we love seafood, my husband got a plate of fried shrimp and I got crab legs and two appetizers for $44.  The second trip we got two apps again and I got a different kind of crab legs and he got fried catfish!  Again, out the door for $44!  Next time we will try another something new- have a feeling you can't go wrong!  If you like gumbo or even if you don't, try it! We have lived in Texas and been in every southern state- best gumbo I ever had but watch it, the first time was literally scalding.  The hush pups are worth it just for the dipping sauce and you get a bunch!  You fill up on seafood not filler sides due to the way you order by the pound like you live in the gulf!  We loved Pappadeaux in Austin and Dallas but here, not so much!  This is half the price and a tastier alternative for seafood!  Oh and regarding a negative review below - this place cannot even be compared to Red (or Rubber as we refer to it) Lobster.  The reviewer obviously missed the point that it's an extremely casual Nawlins style restaurant but would you guess otherwise from the name - please note in my original review I compared it to the much more expensive Pappadeaux, of which I have eaten at three!  Other reviewers mention messy, both times I walk with outstretched hands to the restroom to hose myself off - think the movies kind of crab shack where people are pounding crabs - no mallets here but you get the idea - its a fun place, not fine dining!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great, the atmosphere is very laid back and friendly. Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Food and staff are both great at the AC. Thx Wil for your great friendly service.  My family and I will most certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"I don't typically spend the time to write reviews, but I feel the need to leave a review for this place. My son and I have been out to eat obviously hundreds of times. Our experience at the angry crab was hands down the best experience we've probably ever had in a restaurant. Our server Jamee went above and beyond anything I could have imagined. She was unbelievably helpful in explaining how the menu worked. Her attitude was so good, she let my son sign on the walls and color all over the paper on the table which he absolutely loved. She showed us the easy way to open up our crab legs. She even had one of the guys in the back come out with a live lobster so my son could pet it and see it. I will 100% be back here to see her. The food was all cooked well and the theme of the restaurant is cool in general, but the little details jamee provided made our whole experience!"}
{"text":"It's an adventure that should be on your bucket list! A multitude of seafood by the pound to please every appetite. Season it to your taste. It comes in a plastic bag and is placed on the tabletop and you eat it with your fingers because there is no silverware. Do not wear fancy clothes and expect a quiet meal - it's the exact opposite. It's a noisy, messy place to have fun and enjoy good seafood. Went there for an extended family gathering and the adults had as much fun as the 3-year-old. A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Great experience right from the beginning Matthew was great, bloody Mary's were delicious and the food was better"}
{"text":"Good food, service was good too, but rather expensive. $50 for 2 people for dinner, one being  a child, ummm...not my idea of reasonable."}
{"text":"Really great place for a fun seafood Cajun dinner! Take the kids. Don't dress up. It's messy and fantastic. Pat was our server and he was great!"}
{"text":"Good 'ol fashioned Cajun boil!!! Get the 1lb Shrimp bag, Trifecta and you'll not regret it AT ALL. Geesh...I already can't wait to get back here. Cajun fries were a great compliment. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"First visit to this place and we loved it.  Definitely going to get messy and the heat descriptions are pretty accurate...lol.  We ordered the gumbo to start.  It's a nice healthy bowl that we were able to share and it tasted fantastic.    I ordered the crawfish at a level 2 and the wife got snow crab at a zero.  The crawfish was the cheaper price because it was frozen, and I'll admit the price cut is warranted.  The dads were definitely a little less than juicy...also coulda used some more salt in the boil.  They were still good though for the price.  The snow crab was delicious.   What made this place for us was the service and atmosphere.   Our server was Tori and she was awesome.  Took her time explaining everything and had suggestions.  She's a top notch employee.  There are some things the servers shout out so everyone can hear and stuff...you'll have to go check it out as it's hard to describe.   Some minor constructive criticism...some paper towels on a roll would be awesome and maybe some hot water at the public cleanup station.  The juices are hard to clean off with cold water.  Still had a great time and will definitely be returning with friends."}
{"text":"Started out good , the waiter was great, then went down hill, never saw the waiter again his Name was Dominic. Food was not very good. Order appetizer of fried calamari. No refill on drinks. Was just bad food, and service."}
{"text":"Great place. Came in for lunch, Brodey, Ashley, and one other female server (We didn't catch her name) helped us out. Service was great! Very friendly, and inviting, and they were more than accommodating for us and our toddler. Food was delicious, love the sauce! I got the trifecta level 2, so good, nice and spicy! Very messy, but worth it.  We will be definitely back... With gloves and a raincoat. :)"}
{"text":"We had Valerie as our server and she was awesome! Very friendly and knowledgable on the menu. Love the atmosphere of the restaurant, very upbeat and inviting. Food took a little while longer then I had hoped but it was very busy when we went in. It seems as if they could stand to have a few more servers around such a busy place. We got 2 pounds of snow crab legs and were thoroughly impressed. Thank you so much for everything Valerie and Angry Crab! you were awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of my daughter's and my favorite places to eat. Sam was amazing and attentive to our needs. Can't wait to go back in the near future."}
{"text":"The place has an overwhelming stench of bleach- likely because of the handling of fish but it's truly too much. The food is ok but pricey considering what you get. We had one of everything at our table and by far the kids meals were the worst! The kids would rather consider eating crawfish and frog legs over their over cooked , dry, flavorless chicken."}
{"text":"I went to the angry crab last night and decided to dine at the bar with a couple friends. It was our first time and we had no idea what to order or what we would like, I just have to say they have the best bartender who was so incredibly helpful! Chris helped us get our order in, which took us probably 10 minutes to understand the sauces&spices, btw the drinks he made us were amazing! Great service, great food and great drinks. Thanks Chris, I hope you work next friday :) I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Freaking love everything about this place! From the paper on the table to the bucket that the food comes out in. This place was by far original and one of the best"}

{"text":"We are newbies to AZ and have been in search for the perfect spot for seafood. Low and behold, we found it!   We loved the atmosphere. It is laid back and the decor with the writing on the wall adds to the ambiance. The staff is great and you can tell they enjoy where they work.  Great, casual place to bring the family.   The food is flavorful and good price for what you are getting.  We tried a variety from the king crab, shrimp, crawfish, gator nuggets to the little guy having chicken tenders. Everyone enjoyed their meal.   We will definitely be coming back and bringing our out of town family when they visit."}
{"text":"I must thank the Angry Crab for an amazing Crab bag, Alligator bites, cornbread, corn, bbq beans.  I must complement the chef.   Thank you Angry Crab!  The wait staff at Angry Crab's are inviting, friendly and fast. Shout out to TAMI, our waitress, .... \" Great service.\""}
{"text":"Very expensive, but quite good. The spicy is very spicy. It's fun eating with your hands and all but be prepared to be messy."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere very friendly staff at least most of them. They provide something a little different in the valley and the food was good although a little overpriced for what it is steamed food in a bag shouldn't cost quite so much and they were out of crawfish and I love mud bugs that's what I was most excited for which they should never be but I let it slide and got the shrimp it was good but not great the oysters weren't bad they were fresh and they were fairly priced it seem like everyone there was having a birthday which kind of makes sense based on the price I would go there again"}
{"text":"Pros: great food, fun atmosphere, excellent service Cons: long wait, not cheap  This is a fun place for date night or any night. It's loud and messy, but that's part of the charm. The crab legs were firm and fresh but I would avoid the potatoes, they don't soak up much of the flavors and you can't handle a salt shaker with your messy hands.  Overall fun and vibrant place, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We love coming to this place. Food is great, service is amazing. Today we celebrated a birthday and had Yoga Matt as our server. He was patient with our rowdy bunch and was very entertaining. We recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Pros:  *Snow crab and crawfish is really good. *Very lively environment. *Most servers are very friendly (Mathew was awesome) *Good beer selection.   Cons:  *The spicy level n sauses flavors are inconsistent. (We been here over 15X. We know our flavors) *They have this annoying bell, they ring IT when its someone's bday. (ITS WAY TO LOUD N ANNOYIN)  Best place in town for crab, shrimp n crawfish. I wish the spicy level n was more consistent. I guess it depends on the cooks.   I don't think this is a good spot for small kids. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Not a big seafood lover, but my husband had been craving some mussels and oysters. We were immediately greeted and sat down. Brandon, our server, was very helpful in guiding us through the menu. I've only been to a similar restaurant once but it didn't have the fun atmosphere/staff as Angry Crab.   Got the salmon bag with the trifecta sauce, medium hot. It came with veggies and I added sausage. Flavor was really good. Grilled oysters and soft shell crab (okay, I do eat some seafood) were yummy as well.   I did order a Bloody Mary and it was only okay. Tastes good, not too strong though. That's my only real \"complaint\". Other than that, I think we'd definitely come back, especially when my husband gets a craving for seafood!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Good food, good service, good atmosphere. Our waiter Zach was great.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"went today for lunch, had a great time! our server Matthew was awesome.  try the bloody Mary. food was fresh and delicious.  presentation was interesting. it was my mother's birthday, the treated her like a queen.  thumbs up, we will be back."}
{"text":"Very cool place but DO NOT ORDER THE MUSSELS. We ordered one pound and the mussels are so tiny!!!! After taking the shells off it was enough meat to fill my palm"}
{"text":"We found this gem yesterday. From the moment we walked in the atmosphere and staff were on point. Our server LiLi was very knowledgeable and friendly. One really cool thing is, you can write your name on the walls. The menu is amazing, I had the alligator, frog legs, fried oysters and shrimp (all delicious). I must say the food and service is above many of your main dining establishment here in Phoenix. If you want True Cajun this is the #1 stop. We will be returning."}
{"text":"First time here. The place was sweet. Tori, our waitress, was awesome. If it's your first time please try the Gumbo. You'll do yourself a favor. Peace out."}
{"text":"The angry crab was good. Had a nice fun family environment. And the food was tasty. Just wish you got a little more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a surprise visit to the grand opening.  Service seemed to run smoothly, with little noticed as far as opening mishaps.  We were greeted and sat immediately.  The menu was what you would expect from a Louisiana seafood boil spot.  We ordered the mussels, snow crab, and shrimp; level 2 trifecta.  Our order came out quickly, and the food did not disappoint.  The shrimp were large, the mussels were to die for, and the snow crab...well was crab legs, amazing!  We will definitely be back, we have a couples date night coming up, and this is the perfect spot.  I am so happy they built this spot right up the street.  Love it!!!  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"OMG finally went to this place...the food was really great, staff very friendly and helpful.....I highly recommend bringing gloves, I got the shrimp, very good, but messy....best onion rings I've ever had...We will definitely be going back....."}
{"text":"We've been twice now and both times have had excellent service. Second time was for my birthday and Matthew was great!  It is a fun place with great service and great food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Glad we finally made it here. Yummy food and our bartender Christine was a big help with figuring out what to get for dinner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious with fabulous servers! Chard oysters are amazing, well I haven't gotten anything that I haven't loved. I'm not one for chocolate cake, but the one here really takes it. But if you come during primetime, you will be waiting about an hour or more. Its worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location 4 times now. It is always a great time and great food. We order either snow crab or king crab depending on the market price. This Monday, the Monday special bag contained snow & king crab and shrimp along with mixed veggies - it was very tasty!! I had not tried the shrimp before because I was intimidated by the shell but I will order it from now on. The last couple times we have ordered the gator nuggets and the dipping sauce is delicious. This last visit on 03/28/16 was by far the best service. Our server, Nate was funny and attentive. Next time we go, we will request to sit in his section again!"}
{"text":"Gabe and I recently tried this place and we really liked it. Great business concept too as you don't even need utensils. They just bring out a big piece of rolled paper to cover the entire table where you are also encouraged to color. Then they hand you a bib and your food comes in a bag.  Yes of coarse you may have a plastic fork or knife if you feel like you must have one but my guess is they've eliminated the need for any dishwashers. You can also write on the walls if you choose to do so and can find any room left. Oh, and by the way the food is great and the price doesn't break the budget."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Friday, our first time. What an awesome place, with great food. Gotta give a shot out to our bartender/server Ashley. She was very helpful and informative on the menu. Made our experience worth this post and will have us coming back. :)"}
{"text":"We went to the angry crab for our daughter's 11th birthday! And it was the best experience ever. The atmosphere was casual and happy. I love how at home you feel, you can even write on the walls; my kids loved that! The staff there was very welcoming, Andy (waiter/friend now) was so awesome. He explained how everything works and gave us tips. He truly was great, made us feel at home. This is now our special occasion restaurant. The food was outstanding! Great for families and friends. You guys got to come here! Thank you to the lovely couple next to us. God bless"}
{"text":"Prices are hidden somewhat as far as combos go, but the food is well prepared and fun. Although I'm not a fan of the actual eating with a rock and scissors, but the food was all very well prepared and the drinks and service was pretty great. Not sure if I am going to come back anytime soon as if I was going to pay this much I would much rather go to a more formal restaurant, but if you order smart and ask how much the items are specifically you'll probably have a good time!"}
{"text":"This place is fun and you never feel out of place. Everyone seems to be enjoying the food, the people and the atmosphere. So glad we came here after work! Jana is the absolute best and I would come back for the food, the drinks, and the hospitality."}
{"text":"I finally tried out this place after driving by for months.  I'm a big fan of seafood, but so hard to find a great place like this here.  First off, the vibe here is sooo friendly.  The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful.  He explained how they work.  I don't do fried anything, so the boil in bag was great.  I wanted to try the blue crab, but we went late, so they were out.  Ordered a giant lobster for 2 of us, which I didn't think would be enough so added additional corn and potatoes and a separate bag of mixed vegetables.  So good.  The spice level you choose, but be careful.  I like spicey, but even their mild is quite hot.  We will do this again!"}
{"text":"We went there today to celebrate my mom's (and my) birthday. I've been to other locations, the food is always consistently delicious, but the Glendale location has a secret weapon; his name is MATTHEW! He's super fun, very personable, energetic & super sweet. My mother has a stroke effected side & he came over & peeled ALL of her shrimp. Now, granted, they had just opened & we were the only ones in there, but I didn't expect that at all. He's an exceptional waiter & I'm positive he's very underpaid! This is the only location I want to visit from now on & I live in Avondale. I'm sold. Great job MATTHEW making our birthday lunch memorable!"}
{"text":"How did this place earn top notch in my book?  They didn't mind that we snuck in a bit before closing, and didn't give us any guff.  Beers and food that shouldn't have taken a lot to cook were ordered.  Good gumbo, ice cold beer, and good service.  Not sure how they could improve on that.  The place smelled amazing when I walked in.  Looking forward to trying one of their full blown meals.  And kudos to an extensive beer menu, with a heavy focus on AZ breweries.  And honestly, who doesn't love to draw on a table?"}
{"text":"First time here, and OMG it was amazing. Best seafood I've ever had. Defiantly going back real soon!"}
{"text":"Visited Angry Crab for the first time this past week.  Loved it!  The main seafood is sold by the pound, and just to give you an idea we ordered a pound of Shrimp for $13 and a pound of King Crab for $28.  Luckily I asked about the shrimp and was able to specify that I don't care for my food with a head still attached.  The food tasted great... but the beer selection looked impressive.  Some great local brews to quench you while smashing crab legs with a rock. I recommend the Trifecta sauce for first timers.. also the cajun fries and hushpuppies are awesome."}
{"text":"Service is good. Price is expensive. Sauces are LOADED with MSG. Order the food with no sauce. Food is good. Sauce is not. Service and atmosphere are good. The place is always packed."}
{"text":"This place was fun and I loved the atmosphere. We went for my mother in laws birthday with the whole family and everyone really enjoyed it. They do have a griddle for those with allergies for cooking non seafood items.  Pros: good food, good happy hour, friendly wait staff and cool concept.   Cons: you can't buy half pound orders and I have had better flavor but this was still good.   Great place to take the family or enjoy with a couple friends. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeez, cannot put into words how long we have tried to find a spot in Arizona that is not franchised or something that you can get it almost every state. Put on gloves, have wipes ready, this place is amazing from the customer decor to bringing buckets out with bags and eating with your hands. Authentic, great variety of seafood, portions are equal to dollar amount spent, and service is knowledgable. Monthly visits are a must. Love it!"}
{"text":"BOMB! Medium Trifecta is spicy enough...... snow crab, sausage & potato.....delish!  Only thing better than the food was the helpful & friendly staff"}
{"text":"We  LOVE you Angry Crab!   Great food, nice wait staff, love the ambience...I usually order the catfish basket and fries...best in the universe. Hub always gets the shrimp basket -- we tried the gumbo and it was off the charts good ( but a little pricey..but ok )  We come back as often as time allows.   Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Simply put, best place in Phoenix metro area for fresh seafood. It is pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Justin rocks as a server. Huge portions and even mild can be spicy. Best time to go between 4 & 6 no rush & happy hour"}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack is the best place to get your seafood!!! I absolutely love the lobster tail and shrimp! You have to go and eat there. they have awesome prices to be able to have a good night out."}
{"text":"Found a new place that has quickly become a favorite of my wife and I. Casual atmosphere, no plates, no utensils,  your food comes in a bag, you get tools to crack open the crabs and you just go to town. The table is your plate.   Reminds me of my childhood days in North Carolina. Visited the restaurant twice and will make it a regular spot in the rotation. So far ate the dungeness and snow crabs, OUTSTANDING!   Service was great, the even gave me an assist in opening the dungeness crab do I could feast. Very friendly and engaging. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great casual place for good beer and good seafood. Zach is the man when it comes to the waitstaff, he'll show you how to breakdown your freshly boiled lobster to make sure you get every last delicious bite.  Don't wear anything you're worried about potentially getting messy, and feel free to ask for some of the different sauces on the side."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Angry Crab Shack. Our waiter went over the menu with us and we ended up trying two different types of crabs. The food was delicious and we had a great time making a mess."}
{"text":"Food was great however service not so much. I had someone help me by the name of Lindsay she was very rude. She had a very unpleasant attitude and took very long on my to go order. Don't apply for a people person job if you don't want to deal with people.  Would recommend just avoid her service."}
{"text":"So glad I stopped here. The best crab I ever had in the longest time. Get the trifecta sauce. Totally recommend. YUM!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Best place for seafood. Their flavor is phenomenal and their customer service is excellent. My wife and I come here all the time and most of the time the waiters/waitresses know what we like and I love that. We always get our fries tossed in garlic butter and Parmesan and a little lemon pepper and they always make it right. You guys have a loyal customer for life, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We had a great FAC this evening!  We are certainly \"Angry Crabbers!\"  Bert was the best server/entertainer/host we have had in quite some time!  He was helpful, informative, and always there to take care of you!  We were mostly there for drinks and appetizers.   The beer selection was good and we also enjoyed a Deep Eddy \"grapefruit\" mule!  Yum!  We tasted some wings, with the Pacific Rim as dipping sauce. Delicious! The onion rings were good too. Oysters were on special for $1, so we tried them too!  We were even able to spare some room for some cheesecake and a root beer float!  A great evening with friends, a great staff, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Awesome helpful staff! Very messy but very delicious. I wish there were plates and utensils handy but I think that's part of they Louisiana feel they're going for."}
{"text":"Hands down, the WORST service I've ever seen. Arrived and we're seated. Good so far. Adam was our server but he was busy so someone else took our drink order. Good so far. We ordered crab but the other two in our party ordered salmon and catfish. About 20 min in Adam returns and says that the fish will come out after the crab. No worries,  it takes longer etc. 30 min in the fish arrives. 5 min later oyr crab arrives but its wrong. Plain with no seasoning. Back it goes. After 5-10 min I tell the inlaws to eat so it doesn't get cold. 45 min after ordering still no food. Adam finally stops by and says \"no food?\" We explain and he returns 5 min later with the same food we turned away about 20 min prior. We explain why it's wrong. He comes back 5 min later after just throwing some spice in. It was cold and not remotely appealing. We never got drink refills. At one point he saw my empty cup near the edge for refill,  grabbed the ice tea and walked right past us. I like angry crab but that location is horrid."}
{"text":"Great food manager Jason was cool when we left food on the table, turned back within 2 min and they cleared the table already. He just remade our order. So they really do try to get you seated as soon as the next family leaves."}
{"text":"I love love love love this place me n my wife OMG I can't stop going to this place love it"}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome experience, awesome food. Just know the table is your plate (wax paper covered) and fingers are your utensils . Have fun. I'm sure they'll provide plates and utensils on request if you want to be a party pooper."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have been to the Phoenix location many times almost one a week. I have also gone to the Mesa location and service is always great and waiters have awesome customer service skills. Yesterday we went in and our service was okay. Stephanie was our server and she was nice, but it seemed like she would get a bit upset whenever we asked for something. We asked for extra lemons and salt and pepper and only got one for me and my husband...I would assume if we ask for extra we would at least get enough for both of us, which wasn't the case. We always get the shrimp and the shrimp yesterday was overcooked and falling apart, plus it was missing the awesome flavor I am so used to. Angry Crab is my favorite restaurant, but definitely not this location. I would rather drive out of my way and go to the Phoenix location, where the shrimp are always cooked to perfection and the taste is to die for."}
{"text":"This location has been the better of the four that I have visited. I usually order the 1lb of snow crab, lemon pepper, garlic with potatoes. I am a spicy wimp so it's a Zero on spice it. My husband gets the same but the trifecta (cajun, lemon, garlic). He loves it. I've never had a bad experience at this location The food is delicious. I am not sure about the rest of the food menu, because the bag of snow crab is hard to pass up :)"}
{"text":"Aye! Ye landlubbers and salty dogs Angry Crab is a must stop - Lobster, crab, mussels, prawns, you name it, they have it. LOTS of it!

You can go hotter, but I like the flavor of the Trifecta and the med heat doesn't kill the flavor!"}
{"text":"I've been the Angry Crab a few times. Always had really good experiences. But in January I went with a party of three. Happy hour calamari and clam basket plus 4 other appetizers. The calamari and clam basket tasted different from previous trips. It was a poor presentation and did not taste good. I asked the server if they've gotten any complaints about it that night. He replied yes, and it had not just been that night, it had been since they change distributors. He could see the basket was not eaten. I asked him if he would mind taking it off the bill. He came back later and they had taken off one 1/4 of of the charge. I questioned it. It was only $5. He said since we ate some his manager only took a portion off. I think that is terrible customer service and when I asked the manager on duty he said that I only complained about the clam, so he thought ate the calamari, so he only took off half of the clam charge. It was just ridiculous and for $3.75/$5 we are very unlikely to go back. Such a shame."}
{"text":"What's not to like. This is my favorite Angry Crab Restaurant. Everything I order is always very tasty . If you are an oyster lover, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Loved it. The atmosphere was cool, servers had good sense of humor. It does get loud in there and the servers yell out across the entire restaurant sporadically. I did the crawfish with trifecta at a Level two and it was pretty hot. I wouldn't get the crawfish again merely because it was a lot of work for a little meat. However if you like crawfish, go for it. My husband got snow crab legs and shrimp and that was a great choice. Other family members got either shrimp or crab. Everyone added sausage, potatoes, and corn and I think I'd definitely add those in the future. Overall it was a fun experience and I'd go back again. The one thing I wish they had was a happy hour, or some sort of deal where you get a discount for choosing multiple proteins."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a coworker, as someone who never tried seafood or crab, this place surprised me. Amazing food, one of a few places that have live blue crab. Friendly and polite staff. The food surprised my east coast girlfriend and she loves it."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is good. Trifecta is the best! Atmosphere is good. I have no conplaints. I've been here multiple times already."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times.   Atmosphere: It's loud, they have servers yell at random (\"hey angry crab, someone likes it spicy\"-I think it's when you get food at the #5) They give you bibs. It gets messy since you use your hands. You may want to bring your own baby wipes, they don't have anyone bring any little towelettes or anything.   Apps:  Gator bites-they are a little \"gator-y\", which doesn't say much if you haven't had alligator. Basically, it tastes like gamey chicken, here. Personally I like them better in New Orleans. But, they are fried and come with a really great sauce, which saves them.  Calamari-they come in sticks here with marinara sauce. They weren't overcooked, had a great Cajun seasoning, and I would totally get them again.   Sides: Onion rings-very good. They don't have a super heavy breading, and aren't small pieces of onions like onion straws. They come with ranch.  Cornbread-very basic, what you'd expect cornbread to taste like. I'm pretty sure it's the Jiffy brand. It's decent if you're craving corn bread for $1.   The boil bags are super good. You order by the pound, choose your sauce, (I loved the flavor of the trifecta. It was very well rounded.) Then you choose a spice level, 1-5. I always get a 3, because that is just spicy enough for me to enjoy it with some heat. Then extras, if you like (sausage, corn on the cob, red potato) I always get sausage and red potato in my bag.  I've had shrimp, crawfish, salmon, snow crab legs and lobster. My favorite was the lobster. The shrimp gets overcooked sometimes. The crawfish is good, just a lot of work to break down each piece. The salmon comes in 1in chunks with veggies, so it's not just a single pound of salmon. It was also a little overdone. The snow crab legs were really good, they aren't as much work as the crawfish, and tasted very good.   Kids Meals Fried shrimp-comes with 3 shrimp & a pile of fries. It's not anything super impressive.   Dessert Red velvet cheesecake-if you can make it to dessert, get this. I'm a huge fan of red velvet cheesecake and get it whenever I can. It tastes like the Cheesecake Factory red velvet cheesecake. Since I'm not looking at a menu right now, I'm not sure if it is, but I like it.   Overall, if you want to eat somewhere good, loud and where you get messy, you won't be disappointed, assuming you like seafood."}
{"text":"Cameron was our server here a few days ago and I've been meaning to get on here and write a review. First off, I've been DYING to go to this place. I've told my boyfriend over and over again how much I've wanted to go from all the ads on the radio and finally he took me!  We had Cameron as our server. I absolutely adored him and he took such great care of us. The food was to die for, the place was adorable, and the Bloody Mary was the best I've had. I highly recommend to everyone I see looking for a new place to eat. I can't express how much I love it! Also the oysters .... YUM!"}
{"text":"this place was unbelievable....no plates, no utensils, just plastic bags and your hands....and a scrap bucket....i've never had so much fun eating....and the food was delicious; we shared king crab legs, the vege bag, corn on the cob and 2 potatoes thrown in with the crab....at least they give you a bib so you don't embarrass yourself...LOL!  we started out splitting 12 raw blue point oysters....i live in the PNW...but these oysters were the absolutely best i've ever had...plump and juicy..."}
{"text":"The husband surprised me here with date night, at first I did not know what to expect when you find out all you get is a rock, scissors and a seafood cracker.. The staff was very friendly, patient, attentive and informational. I got king crab legs with the Trifecta sauce (it was a little too much butter for my liking). My husband got the snow crab with the Pacific Rim sauce which I would recommend to anyone! We also tried the gumbo which was quite tasty. My only recommendation is they add a little more meat! In all, the utensils were not bad at all, it made the evening more enjoyable! We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were driving to go to Lee Lee and stumbled upon this place.  Atmosphere is pretty cool, a lot of writing on the wall and people with a bib on eating crab and shrimp.  We got a pound of snow crab and a pound of shrimp.  One with garlic and the other with the trifecta.  The flavors were great, but we would probably get the king crab instead - smaller crab legs are much harder to break open with all the sauce.  Service was great, we all had fun, would recommend.  Only reason I'm holding back the 5th star is because we ordered some fried food and it took well over 25 minutes to get to us.  The manager comped that dish."}
{"text":"Tori the server! Holy moly this girl was one heck of a server. Not only was she fast, she was extremely personable and fun! She explained the menu in depth as it was the first time my boyfriend and I have been there and cautioned me exactly how spicy the spiciest option was. I have to say, this place is worth the price and if you can get Tori you are in GREAT hands! Hope she gets promoted to management someday! Thanks Angry Crab and thank you Tori for rocking it out!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review.  After all, I started my Angry Crab experience all the way back when first Angry Crab restaurant opened in Arizona (at Tempe).  I also tried the one at Indian School.  They are both well managed and foods are always fresh and prepared correctly.  This one at Cactus Rd. is an exception and I think it has a lot to do with the management at this location.  I have been to this particular Angry Crab restaurant for more than 20 times since they first open.  Staffs are always friendly, but they have a very high turnover compare the other two other Angry Crabs I had been to.  Their staffs are trained poorly and many of them probably left due to the frustrations.  I am saying this here just so you understand that if you happen to get a poor service, it's likely due to the lack of training, and they are not the ones to blame.  This restaurant strongly dominant the west valley thanks to very little competition here.  The Hot and Juicy Crawfish restaurant at the Glendale Ave. (10-15 minutes away) is probably the only competitor in this area.  This means, if you live in this neighborhood, then you really don't have much choice when you are craving for some real seafood and not willing to drive far to Scottsdale or downtown Phoenix.    So here are the things I suggest:  1.  To go order - Make sure you get everything you ordered and double check your bill before you leave.  They will miss something half of the time (literally).  For example, make sure you get the sausages in the bag, your veggies...etc.  Again, please do not blame the staff for the missing item.  The management simply does not provide quality training at this particular Angry Crab.  2.  Raw oysters - This restaurant started with Blue Point oysters then switched to Gold Band oyster, which was a wise decision.  Gold Band doesn't require much skills, so they cannot screw up your raw oysters.    However, as far as I know, they now changed back to Blue Point oysters.  This is quality stuff, but they usually don't have a skillful chef to shuck those oysters.  This means, you will very likely to get muddy raw oysters.  DO NOT LET THEM TELL YOU THAT'S NORMAL.  Those mud are not good for you.  Ask the waiters to have chefs clean those oysters up before they bring it to you.  Chances are, you will still get something muddy.  What you can do is get a glass of water and do the cleaning yourself.  Now, if you don't mind the driving and want some real raw oysters, then get yourself to Buck and Ryder at Scottsdale during the happy hour time, or simply go to other Angry Crab restaurants.  Hot & Juicy sucks at raw oysters too so don't even bother to test your luck there.  Note that I haven't touched their raw oysters for months so that information might not be up-to-date.  If they serve Gold Band again, then you are safe, no worries there.  3.  Shrimps - Shrimp quality/freshness is not consistent, so good luck on that.  This is an issue with every Angry Crab restaurant, not just the one at Cactus Rd.  If you are a shrimp lover, then try Hot & Juicy if you keep having horrible luck at Angry Crab.  UPDATE (10/18/2017) - This restaurant starts to take it up a notch on the to-go orders.  They will double check your orders and make sure everything is correct before you leave.  Ever since my previous review, I only had something missing once and they took care of it right away.  On a separate note, Shrimps' freshness/quality still could use some improvements (it's inconsistent as of now).  Updating it to 3-stars."}
{"text":"A+ Experience at the Angry Crab in Peoria!   Server: Matthew made the experience!  Super cool server!  Helpful, attentive, and really takes the time to get to know his guests!  Made a first time guest feel at home and made ordering easy.  Consistently was refilling our drinks and he remembered that my sister (she'd be there before) liked her drinks without ice.  It's been years since I've ever considered requesting a specific server at a restaurant, but next time I'll wait to be served by Matt!    Seafood: Quality food! The meal was so good it was easy to overeat...and we did!!! We tried the King Crab, Snow Crab, Shrimp, and the Raw Oysters on the half shell!  I was told that the Angry Crab was known for the trifecta sauce (we ordered without butter - trying to be a bit healthy) on both types of crab and it was awesome!  Cajun sauce on the shrimp (again no butter) was great too!  There are lots of options on the types/combinations of sauces available for guests.  We went with the \"mild\" sauce which has just enough spice to be spicy, but didn't burn our throats.  If you like \"hot\" spices I'm confident they can help you out.  Ask Matt about your options and he can make recommendations about what to try.  Food Portions: Oysters were good and of average size.  The one pound servings of crab and shrimp seemed very generous!    Other Food to Consider: I recommend the corn on the cob (I ordered two) as it is served with the entries in the sauce.  Tried the beans which were ok (my sister loved them).  The corn bread was average, not bad, just not as impressive as everything else.   We'll have to come back to try other options (Blue Crab, Lobster, and lots of other side dishes) on the menu.  Atmosphere: Fun, very casual, TVs playing sports in the restaurant.  The servers are pretty vocal/fun and add to the atmosphere when it's someone's birthday or when someone orders the \"hot\" sauces  on the food.  Don't be alarmed by the siren that goes off to \"celebrate\" birthdays, etc.  The Wait: On a Friday night we waited about 10-15 minutes which was fine and it was completely worth the short wait.    Price: Quality Seafood comes with a price.  $28/lb the king crab. $23/lb for snow crab, and $13/lb for the shrimp.  $8 for 6 oysters.  $16 for 12 oysters.  Prices change based upon the market.  The Mess: Eating crab and shrimp can be a bit messy especially with the Angry Crab sauces.  Recommend wearing dark clothes to avoid clothing stains, wear the bib they provide (Matt will help you put it on) and go with the flow.  You'll also go through a lot of napkins!  Summary: Superb Server, Tasty Food, and Fun Atmosphere! I recommend The Angry Crab if you'd like an amazing seafood experience! If you go to this restaurant I guarantee you'll leave feeling the complete opposite of \"angry!\"  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite seafood place in AZ.  I walked in the door and saw the way the place waa decorated and knew it waa right up my alley.  Walls and tables have signatures and writing all over them, music and tvs are playing and tons of talking and laughing as well.  When you sit down to eat the table ia covered in white paper and there is a napkin box on it.  Perfect for me cause I hate places that have so much piled in the middle of the table that you can't see the person sitting across the table.    Now on to the food.  They have baskets of fried seafood, poorboys and even a cheeseburger  (although not sure why you would eat a cheeseburger with all the delicious seafood available) but the highlight is the seafood by the pound.  Chose your favorite  (mussels, crabs, shrimp, crawfish, etc), then your sauce and then your level of spiciness and it's steamed and brought to you in a plastic bag.  No utensils in this place so if you have an aversion to eating with your fingers you might want to pick something else off the menu.  Tonight we had fried clams and fried calamari for appetizers.   My boyfriend had the fried cod basket with cajun fries and coleslaw while I opted for a pound of shrimp with the trifeca spices at a level 2 spiciness.   It was perfect and I wish I could have gotten another pound but then I would have to roll out the door.   Our server Kieran was friendly and attentive, and I would request him again.  Do yourself a favor and come check out this place."}
{"text":"Had the boil shrimp very disappointed. No flavor in the shrimp, the sauce had flavor but it did not make it into the flesh of the shrimp."}
{"text":"well not sure how to rate this place the food is good but a lot of work for what your paying they don't give you any thing to open the crap with or even to take the intestinal tract out of the shrimp heads and tails just yummy but the other not so much I'll try it again but I'll be armed with all I need to destroy my crab"}
{"text":"The trifecta sauce, which was the restaurant's special - was so bland. It was like dipping the meat in hot water and having it. Two stars because the place and ambience was good."}
{"text":"Mmmm good I guarantee!   Had the shrimp bag with corn, sausage and potatoes.   Trifacta medium heat it was delicious.   Would skip the corn next time.  Even ate just the garlic in the bag...felt guilty about it.  For a Louisiana restaurant,  they need sweet tea, not the same with just sugar.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite seafood place in Phoenix- yes, i said Phoenix. They fly everything in fresh.  Its the Trifecta sauce that you habe to try on the shrimp. Yum yum good."}
{"text":"Ok I normally stay away from seafood places away from home. My Uncle wasted to try it so we did. OMG!! Oh yea!!! Had the blue crab and they are intact! Get them trifecta with more spices and they are perfect. They are boiled perfectly and are fresh (well what I had - they fly them in fresh! The garlic was like candy and went so well the crab. This is all coming from someone from New Orleans! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the many small seafood places you find near the shore in New England, such as Browns in Seabrook NH. All the food was excellent, though my oysters were forgotten and removed from the bill. Crab legs are highly recommended. IF YOU LOVE FRESH SEAFOOD, DON'T MISS THIS."}
{"text":"I'm an Angry Crab Shack fan since finding them in SOCAL. Love the seafood, sides & cocktails are delish. They've really got this style of cooking down & the price is reasonable. Love it! This location is clean, quick service & fun atmosphere. This is fun place for sure so bring the whole fam."}
{"text":"100% RECOMMEND !!!!!! I just want to say thank you so much for some of the bestest experiences I have ever received! THE FOOD IS ALWAYS DELICIOUS, THE SERVICE IS INCREDIBLE! From the first time I ever went to present day! My first time was Aug of 2017; my grandmother was struggling to cut her crabs and a waiter noticed we were all taking turns trying to help her with breaking them as we ate ourselves; the waiter came over and said \"You guys are here to enjoy your food and not work, im here for work and to serve you!\" He sat down next to her and helped her break all her crab legs open. We all greatly appreciated it and so did my grandmother!!!! I have been to many restaurants, and this one by far has gave me EXCEPTIONAL service. Everytime they some how seem to always go above and beyond my expectations and I applaud you and I thank you for it!!!!!! My family and I will forever be loyal to you guys,"}
{"text":"I looked forward to eating here for months and I'm extremely upset I ever set foot in the place.  My experience began with a hostess who has zero personality, zero emotion and has no business being in the service industry.  I walked up and she just looked at me, no welcome, no nothing.  I finally had to tell her how many were in my party.  She then told me 30 to 35 minutes, which turned out to be what she tells everyone.  It turned into a nearly hour wait.  I was not impressed with the trashy shack décor. I'm not interested in reading names and profanity on the walls while I eat.  Even though this is a brand new location, I was seated at a chair that looked about 20 years old, like it had been through the war, with most of it's covering warn off.  Our server came over and tried to explain the very confusing menu.  We strained to hear over the noise while she yelled at us.  We explained my mother was extremely hungry, low sugar, and needed her to place an appetizer order for onion rings.  Skip ahead and she forgot to put in the order so our onion rings came toward the end of our meal.  The next phase of this painful adventure began with how they server their food.  Whatever item is ready first gets served, no matter if it's a side, an appetizer or the main course.  And no one at the tables is served at the same time!  So you are left with either looking like a pig and start eating while the rest of the table stares at you or leave your food sitting, getting cold as you wait for the other diners food.  My parents ordered fried food, shrimp and calamari.  Both were so bland and void of flavor they were no better than bar food or grocery store frozen food.  Not to mention they were overcooked, nearly burnt.  I tried the boiled shrimp.  by default they serve them with the heads, tails, entrails, et.al.  I opted for no heads which is a $2 up charge.  The shrimp was nothing to write home about.  I ordered garlic butter but I never detected a spec of either.  What I got was watered down, rubbery shrimp complete with legs, entrails and the food poisoning that comes with it.  They add your choice of spice but I have no idea what's in it.  It had no redeeming flavor, just a mild burning sensation in my mouth.  Oh, and did I mention, the entire time we nearly went deaf from the constant noise, screaming kids, parents screaming at their kids, kids running around like the place is a playground, gloves being turned into balloons used to bonk other diners on the head.  I have never witnessed such a barbaric display of humanity, even while dining at the local burger clown house.  Please do yourself and your toilet a favor and stay away!  Do not believe the fake hype and faux praise.  Stick with the more civilized Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack or even Pete's Fish and Chips.  At least at RL you get those amazing cheddar bay biscuits, salad and properly cooked food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and great food. My expectations were blown away. My server was awesome at refilling drinks and kept our table clean. He was professional and friendly! He had to go home and left us with another server who was also great! The food... wow. We had shrimp with ghosts pepper powder. Had my lips burning. I'm excited to bring family to try it! Yum!"}
{"text":"Try it once and you will be hooked. I will never step foot into another red lobster or Joes. Quality and price can't be topped!! We will be visiting often!"}
{"text":"Great seafood and a fun place to be the staff are great and atmosphere ask for Mathew he was an awesome host and if you like your food spicy try the level 4 spices"}
{"text":"Visiting family in El Mirage, went to The Angry Crab. Food was delicious but the service could have been better. I understand the place was jumpin so I'll only take away 1 star. Our waitress was nice just not on our drinks and things we asked for, such as our side of butter and napkins. Tori (our waitress) if you're reading this I'm sorry. You're awesome and I know you were busy it just sucked waiting for our beers and having to order from other wait staff. Now that's out of the way, food was excellent. Go to The Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"I really do not know what to say.   We go here almost every Sunday after church .  Have not been here in a month due to the fact that they changed there sauce.  When we first started to come here the trifecta sauce was awsome.  The last 3 times it sucked.  Got level 2 and it was nothing but hot spice.  I had to ask for more butter to make it more mild.  That worked but I was charged 50 cents for the butter.  That is a rip off.   We told management about the change.  Heard new owners and they are trying to save on cost.  To many people waste the sauce.  Well then put extra sauce on the side if asked.  Why should we have to suffer.   Unfortunately to many times back and the place is just going down hill.   So today we are going to try Hot and Juicy at west gate.  Heard it was better.  To much money for a meal that sucks.   Go back to original trifecta sauce and we will be back.   Until then we will spend our money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went to the Angry Crab to celebrate my wife's birthday. Diane and her staff were spot on, we had a party of eight and drinks, appetizers and dinner all came together and everything tasted amazing!  This is definitely our go to place!"}
{"text":"First timers with a great experience thanks to our awesome server, Sam!  Crab, lobster, clams and some sides. The spices and sauces brought wonderful tears to my eyes. Finger licking good, every step of the way, can't wait to come back, some other day!  Thanks again Sam!"}
{"text":"First visit to this location. Consistency and quality are just as outstanding as all the other. Staff is always friendly and prompt. We had a table of 9 on a Sunday friends and friends from ND). Got seated no issues. Outr out of state friends are still raving about this place. I will continue to go to Angry Crab Shack all locations. BEST seafood in town!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun place to eat and Sam was an awesome waitress! We will come back here again. They have great snow crab and wonderful king crab. Try getting your steam pot spiced up with the trifecta seasoning!"}
{"text":"I was reviewing another restaurant and Yelp suggested a few places we should try and Angry Crab was one of them. It is very close to our house but we had no idea being pretty new to Phoenix. Well living in the desert fresh seafood is hard to find. After reading the reviews we had to check it out. Well we were not disappointed. We got the king crab legs with the trifecta. Spice level 2. We also got the soft shell crab basket. We loved everything and sa ores every morsel. The service and atmosphere were both great as well. Thank you Yelp for recommending this place to us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It was my first time at this location and went with my man's family (it was their first time ever).   I'm sad that crawfish are not in season...it's my fave! Apparently crawfish is only in season during the months that end in -Y...(so just a head's up)  Service was amazing! Everytime a server walks by they always check up on us...we never felt like we were waiting for someone to help us.  Food was amazing...I think my flavor would be trifect Mild... we chose trifecta 0 because they don't like spicy food...but I like a little bite ;)  We had the king crab...omg 28 a lb..it was sooo good tho!!! If you can afford it, def try it!!!!  Can't wait to come back! It's always fun eating with my hands and \"fighting\" over the food lol"}
{"text":"OMG!  Delicious seafood, attentive and fun service, and a crazy wall-drawn atmosphere.  I had a pound of clams with garlic and lemon pepper seasoning and Jim had a pound of king crab legs with the \"trifecta\" seasoning, Cajun, garlic, and lemon pepper.  We each added a half ear of corn to our \"steam bags\".  Dang, it was so tasty!  Matthew, thank you for your awesome service!"}
{"text":"I was so excited about a seafood restaurant opening close by. We went there for dinner last month and we ordered the shrimp in a bag and fried soft shell crabs. The shrimp was mediocre at best and I could not eat the crab....if there was crab in there. All I tasted was fried thick, greasy dough. The service was good. I hope that they improve on the quality of their food. Might give it one more try."}
{"text":"Awesome oysters and Best snow crab legs I've had! Looking forward to coming back for blue crab since it was sold out. Wings were even good and meaty!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved that your order came in a bucket, loved the seasoning, I think I had sauce up to my elbows. Yep we're going back."}
{"text":"The food here was great and it was the most fun eating out of a plastic bag I have ever had! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"a little pricey. Went for a late lunch, bartender was nice. beer was cold. I thought that the food was a little slow to get to me, honestly. There weren't more than 10 people in there thought they could have been faster and more attentive. Having said that, it was good."}
{"text":"Why is it when a place isn't busy the service is the worst! Can't go wrong really with oysters and crab legs!  The trifecta sauce was good  Forgot to bring coleslaw and they charge $1 for butter and brought 3 without mention.  Wouldn't probably visit again when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I have 3 little girls and they want to be eating King crab legs every Sunday they love it, we love it, food is delicious. Great service. Awesome spot Definitely in my top 10."}
{"text":"Really nice lunch and staff. It was an excellent time and we hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"So amazing!!! I felt like a gained about 10 more pounds eating here haha but hey, sometimes it's okay to treat yourself :p. Atmosphere is not fancy at all so you can wear whatever you want to. The employees are very kind when I went and there are some cool stuff on the menu that you won't find very often in AZ like frog! However, the frog was not very yummy to me :/. You should definitely come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love the environment and the food and the beer and the smell. Reminds me of Key West."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, liked the atmosphere, settings, etc. The staff was friendly, and attentive. I had the gumbo, not the best I have ever had, but very tasty. I could have use more shrimp, sausage, etc and the calamari was very good.  We will go there again and try their dinners."}
{"text":"Glad we didn't have to wait at 6pm on a Sunday evening, it was a loud and fun experience. Ordered a pound of crawfish and a pound of shrimp in the trifecta sauce and it was great. Lowen was our server and did a great job. If you order the hottest level, they ring a siren which scared me at first."}
{"text":"What a fun place.  Had a couple Purple Haze beers while writing on the wall with Sharpies. Yes,  they actually want you to draw on their walls.  My husband and I ordered one pound of snow crab and one pound of shrimp.  We chose the trifecta level 3 for the heat and flavors.  All I can say is awesome.  Heavy garlic flavor with just the right kick.  Ordered a few red skinned potatoes,  hush puppies and angry edamame.  The potatoes soaked up the trifecta intensely.  Were delicious. I didn't like that the hush puppies were served with ranch dressing.  I love tartar sauce. Would have been much better with it, imho. The crab was to die for.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great casual place to grab some yummy seafood. I have a rule about not touching food but I throw it out the window when it comes to Angry Carb. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun. Great selection of beers too!"}
{"text":"lts been a long time since I've had truly fresh seafood.  In the valley, many eateries and restaurants claim fresh seafood but it is not.  The grilled salmon was fresh and had the \"sweet\" flavor that fresh salmon should with no \"fishy\" after taste.  It comes with rice and choice of sides.  I had the coleslaw.  I felt the coleslaw lacked vinegar, seasoning and marination time.  I'm giving 5 stars because the quality of the seafood.  The environment is definitely not for a romantic date, but more a place for families and friends to enjoy some good food in a casual atmosphere with intermittent energetic outbursts.  If people have a birthday or special occasion the serving crew announces it with sirens and bells.  The crew covers each other to make sure everyone is being served promptly.  But they do not rush you.  I will definitely be taking my family to eat seafood here."}
{"text":"Were anxious for the Peoria location to open. It was worth the wait. My wife and I went on Sunday afternoon. Our server, Nate, was excellent. Even though the place was busy, he was professional and friendly. Eager to answer any questions and prompt with drink refills. We felt relaxed and enjoyed our time at Angry Crab Shack. The menu is diverse, but we both got the shrimp po boy. Everything was good. Far exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The Angry Crab Shack is AWESOME! My buddy Hailey and I went here on Friday for the first time ever, simply because we wanted to try something new. This place popped up on my Yelp suggestions, and we chose to give it a shot especially since it was rated so high. It's about a 20 minute drive from our college so we arrived fairly quickly. Upon arrival, we were literally seated within 30 seconds, and yet the place was bustling! Since it was our first time being there, our waiter gave us the whole run down of how the restaurant's ordering works and the food options that they had. Angry's signature item was their \"boil bag\", which is essentially a mini version of a Louisiana Crab Boil. You could select your choice of seafood (shrimp, clams, crawfish, lobster, etc.), your flavor and spice level seasoning (much like those of Wingstop, if you've ever been there), and add-on items, such as red potatoes or corn on the cob. The seafood for the boil bags are only available for purchase in increments of 1 lb, meaning you can't buy 1/4 or 1/2 pounds, but that's fine. Trust me, you'll be glad you got the 1 lb. of food. All of their seafood come whole (meaning the shell, head, legs, etc. are attached), so once you de-shell everything you will actually end up with much less of a lb. of food. Our waiter, Bert, was super awesome and extremely helpful with us, again, as we were new to ACS. We obviously had to try the boil bags. I ordered the shrimp bag with \"wimpy\" spice, the trifecta flavoring, and red potatoes. Hailey had the same thing, but with crawfish. This joint is \"backyard style\" as Bert said, and there are no silverware in sight. Your only utensils are your hands, which adds a fun novelty to it in my opinion (of course, unless you get crab or lobster, which in that case they provide you with metal leg crackers). There are also no plates or bowls either; the tables are covered in a sheet of paper in which you can just dump your food all over and have a pig-trough with all of your friends! Bert tied bibs around our necks and served us our drinks in minutes. Once he took our order, we had our food in under ten minutes (again, this place was bustling busy!) which was surprising. Our food was amazing, by the way. The trifecta seasoning (cajun spices, lemon butter, and herb garlic) is completely awesome and I highly recommend it! Next time however, I think I will kick it up a notch or two with the spice. The \"wimpy\" was too weak for me, haha. We had to de-shell the shrimp and crawfish with our own hands (if you are squeamish I would not recommend a boil bag in this case), but they provide you with a metal bucket to toss the shells in. The price was pretty good too; my meal cost around $17 (1-lb shrimp boil bag, plus 2 red potatoes and a drink). Hailey and I both thoroughly enjoyed our time and meals here, and Bert the waiter was AMAZING. We even dropped a few kind words to the manager about him. He was really THAT awesome. If you get seated in Bert's section, consider yourself blessed. We really wish that we could have left him a gigantic tip, but being broke college students, that isn't an easy thing to do! We will definitely be back for more. Thanks Bert and the ACS crew!"}
{"text":"The only star I am willing to give this place is for the customer service. Everyone was great but I literally cringe and gag at the idea of ever eating crab legs, ever again. The presentation was horrid and no amount of washing my hands cleaned the amount of grease from digging my hand into a plastic bag to retrieve the crab legs, oh and did I mention, PLASTIC BAG?!? No silverware or plates. I'm sorry eating like a cave women is not my cup of tea!  Overall it could be a cool place to visit with friends for drinks."}
{"text":"Since its opening, I admit, I love this place. Not the widest variety of menu but what they do, they do well. Very fresh seafood served, in most cases, au natural...finger style. They offer Monday specials and \"Flash specials\" from time to time. This is a fun SEAFOOD joint. Don't expect salad or burgers. Choose from perhaps 15 different fresh offerings then pick your seasonings and spice. Then enjoy! Their pricing other than for baskets is by the pound and usually fresher and priced lower than that Red place all over the country. Bring your friends with you as this is a very fun...and pleasantly noisy place. Bring your big felt pen and you can make your mark! They also have a meeting room. The provided bibs are very fashionable too."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Nice casual place to go.  Everyone seems happy there because the atmosphere is fun.  Food is good a bit messy but good."}
{"text":"Really really good! Wife and I came here for the first time and the food was great and the customer service was great. We usually eat at oscars pier 83 and we really like that but this place has a Louisiana feel to it. We ordered 1lb of shrimp and 1lb of snow crab legs and gator bites. The shrimp and crab legs sauced with trifecta sauce and spiced with #3. I really enjoyed it and will be back. Shack and Tori our servers did a great job and very friendly and helpful for our first visit.    6-25-16 Another great meal at crazy crab. Po boy basket with fries and cod basket with fries and beans. Just might come back for dinner tonight. Wife and I really enjoy eating here. Shack was our server again and as last time great guy great service."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it. We were a big party and our Emily was awesome. I had the trifecta shrimp with corn  OH MY GOSH  so freaking good I can't believe I have waited to long to come and try this place.  Yes you will get dirty and you will eat with your hands by it will be amazing.  I also had their Bloody Mary which was actually pretty good. It is on the pricey side but it's seafood so what can you expect: I will be back :) absolutely loved it restrooms were clean and overall everyone working there is very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"A wide range of hot seasonings made my shrimp order very much different from run of the mill boiled shrimp. I'll be back soon! Plus, Olivia my server was extremely helpful to this newbie."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood! For Arizona this is probably some of the best boardwalk style seafood you'll get without spending a fortune on it in Scottsdale. The wait staff and hostesses are always very friendly. I think they go a little overboard (no pun intended!) on all the sirens and hootin' and hollerin' for birthdays and various reasons. I get it's supposed to have that sort of \"feel\" but I think it could be toned down just a bit. Also, the prices are definitely steep. Furthermore, they don't do phone reservations, you have to be there to get on the wait list which can often take 45 minutes or so for dinner, although this does tell you how good their food is. If you can get by those few quirks you're in for some great seafood."}
{"text":"Excellent food, superior service, and great beer selection!  Angry Crab puts Hot and Juicy to shame in every category.  We came with a large group for a birthday party and had to wait over an hour but it was well worth it.  Mathew was our server and he was exceptionally good at his job.    I had snowcrab with sausage, potatoes, and corn with the trifecta sauce and hot level.  It was awesome.  The corn and sausage were the best part about it along with the sauce.  Next time I will go one level hotter.  I likes it real hot.  I also tried the salmon, fried catfish, beans, fried shrimp and french fries.  All of it was money.  I really liked the fried shrimp.  Everyone in our group was very happy with the food and service.  I would definitely come here again and highly recommend it to others.  Update 1/10/18:  I've been back several times and the service is still impeccable.  The food is consistently good.    My new favorite flavor is Pacific Rim level 5.  It's got a curry base and level 5 is hotter than hell.  I love it.  Their spicy edamame is also good as is their catfish and fries."}
{"text":"Went to eat at the Angry Crab Peoria and it was fantastic, the food was great and  the atmosphere was fun ...I will definitely be a regular ....Highly recommend this place. ..."}
{"text":"Great food and staff is incredible. Snapper is excellent and our server Jonya was great. Happy hour drinks yummy."}
{"text":"Came to this location last night ( 1/6/18) for my mother in laws birthday. If I had a choice I would give this place no stars. We had the worst experience here. The manager there did not show any empathy even though we come in once a week and spend $300. We will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and Regina was a great server. The serving was very interesting . Reminiscent of a seaside happiness.. Food was brought to you in a bag you spread it out on the paper on the table and you ate it with your hands.  This is a great place for a date night. Who has a party atmosphere. But not very intimate."}
{"text":"A GREAT dinner this time!  My waitress even helped me open my crab legs for me.  The food was hot and plentiful.  As stated, the service was excellent-by everyone.  All the people working there were very friendly even though the place was very busy.  Everyone seemed on the same page from the people who first greet you to the people cleaning up your table when you finish.  We left full & content.  A place we look forward to taking our friends to."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for my 1st time today since he had been here a few weeks ago with his boss. He absolutely loved it and wanted me to share in the love.  If you're a shell fish type of seafood junkie, u gotta come here. It located in a plaza with plenty of parking. We came on a Sunday early afternoon and the place wasn't crazy busy, but had just the right amount of patrons to be seated right away. The host was friendly and promptly greeted us when we walked in. I was intrigued by all the cool writing on the walls as you can actually doodle on them. Our waitress was amazing and attentive.  We ordered 2lbs king crab legs each, a dozen raw oysters, 2 bloody Mary's ( mine came with a crab leg), and chocolate cake to go. ALL of the food was delicious. They had scissors and a stone to crack the crab legs. Plan to get messy as your table is your plate, just tear open your bag and go to town.   My 1st impression of this place was a success. I absolutely loved coming here. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Service and great tasting food.  Although no longer on the menu, they made me an oyster PoBoy.  Only thing missing was a touch of 1000 Island Dressing.  I'll bring my own next time.  Wife had the fish and chips, which was piping hot and more than she could eat.  Also had a dozen raw oysters on the half shell.  They were big and plumb, and served ice cold.  Tasted like they were caught and shucked right off the boat .  Going again Friday night, I need some oysters."}
{"text":"We love Angry Crab! The food is amazing, the servers are friendly and very helpful, and you definitely won't walk away hungry! That being said... here are some tips: Don't go here with anyone hard of hearing unless you're both skilled lip readers. The noise level is pretty high. Don't wear anything you can't live without unless you're going to play it safe and get their (amazing) fried shrimp. This place is butcher paper and bibs. Don't forego the fries and onion rings in lieu of potato salad or coleslaw. You'll be missing out on some amazing carbs! Don't go on a weekend for dinner, thinking you'll get right in. This place is hoppin'!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and there was no wait. Our server Bert was very enthusiastic and patient with us. We had ordered a Dirty South Lemonade and didn't like it so our server happily took it back and allowed us to get something else. We ended up getting a Hurricane which was delicious.   The atmosphere was excellent, it was relaxed, playful, and fun, with Canjun music! You get to eat straight on the table with just scissors and your boil bag. We ordered a Snow Crab Boil ($18) and a Andouille Po'boy ($11), which was delicious.   The only negative are the prices, it's a bit expensive so I'll probably just come here for special occasions."}
{"text":"Baskets, bags and platters! Angry Crab did not disappoint. When my daughter expressed that she would love to eat crab again, I decided to give Angry Crab a shot. Thank you to Yelp Reviewers who enticed me with their reviews and photographs.  The decor is cute! The wait-staff was friendly and energetic. Tatum, our server was super helpful and attentive. She was thorough guiding us through the menu. When we found out that they had live blue crab, we ordered a pound of blue crab ($13/lb), hush puppies ($4), half dozen raw oysters in a half shell ($8).   Hushpuppies were amazing! Fluffy inside, crunchy outside, they were so very tasty and spicy, packing a little punch. It was good with Ranch and Cocktail sauce.  Oysters were top notch as well. They were decent-sized except for one small one, fat and tasty. Condiments were traditional except instead of lemons, they served limes. I actually liked the zing. I enjoyed slurping the salty juice off the shell.  Thanks to Yelp Reviewers, we chose the trifecta saucing with our blue crabs (Cajun spices, butter and garlic). You did not steer us wrong. Yum! The first crab I opened up was perfect. It was a male. Under the shell, it was lovely and creamy. Meat was firm and sweet. Just fabulous. The second crab was dead, dead, dead. Also male, under the shell, there was nothing but membrane. The flesh in the body was shrunken and mushy. When we spoke to a passing server, he dismissed it as, \"That's just blue crabs.\"   \"I disagree with you.\" He quickly discerned that I wasn't going to accept his response. \"I will get the manager.\"   Kudos to the manager! He did not argue with me. He asked if I would like another crab. The crab he brought the next time was as perfect with the first. When our server Tatum came to check with us, we shared our notes about the dead crab. She said she wouldn't have known the difference between a live crab or dead one after cooking. So, we proceeded to show the difference between the texture of the flesh and described the flavor.   Live seafood: Blue Crabs, Dungeness Crabs, Maine Lobster, Crawfish! Snow Crab Legs are not live. I will be back to try the Dungeness Crab next!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and I was not impressed.  The svc was ok and the food was mediocre. I love seafood and this just did not do it for me.  I won't be coming back... and won't be suggesting this place to anyone I know either."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fun time getting our hands full of shrimp, snow crab, sausage, potatoes, and vegetables.  We liked the backyard atmosphere.   We enjoyed the various staff stopping by to chat and offering suggestions for ordering and managing our meal.  It was like having all the neighbors at a BBQ.  The food was excellent - we ordered everything trifecta style.  Matt and Will were great."}
{"text":"First of all I have to say everyone there was very very nice and helpful especially the waiter. But the crab had no flavor even with the spicy seasoning that I requested. If you really want to know the truth it taste like I bought it from Frys  and it was previously frozen nothing like Hot and juicy theirs is flavorful fresh!! Also I ordered a pound of King crab and got nowhere near it. They swore up-and-down that it was a pound but when I go to hot and juicy I have two very large king crab legs and that's a pound so what I had I have no idea how much it was but it was not a pound so needless to say I won't be going back. If I want to pay $26 for Crab that I didn't even get ill go to Frys lol. Oh instead of making it right and giving me my full pound of crab they gave me a piece of cheesecake they could have kept that."}
{"text":"Started out with really poor service, our waitress couldn't seem to remember what we said and very low on personality. Overall in the end the food was good and the service improved."}
{"text":"This is not a first date place because you get very messy but the food is delicious. Go for the trifecta spice it is the perfect combo of spices."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is great. I just didn't like the atmosphere because of a lot of loud noises and yelling. But that's what people go there for."}
{"text":"Always such a good experience coming to this location! It was super packed but our waiter still did a great job! The food was delicious and already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience! Everything was perfect and the service was exceptional. Make sure to order the fried oysters. You will be extremely happy with your choice and you get a bunch for only 7 bucks!  We are definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is Super delicious!! I would highly recommend the food is amazing!! I come here Atleast once a week. Shrimp, sausage, potatoes in trifecta sauce med."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on a friday night.  It was packed.  Loud fun atmosphere.  We sat in the party room, which the waitress said is rarley used unless for parties.  It was quiet in this room which was nice.  I had the pound of shirmp boil trifeca sauce anr medium spice.  Thr medium spice was hot lol.  My girlfriend had thr king crab trifeca sauce no spice.  The food is really good no complaints.  Solid 4 star.  You get no plates just a bag of boil and your table covered in paper."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was friendly and efficient.  They are kid friendly and work with the party to keep the food coming and the trash leaving!  We really enjoyed our dinner.  They have great washing stations in the dining room to clean up when you are done as well."}
{"text":"This is the first time I was @ The Angry Crab. Was extremely happy with my Shrimp dinner pick. Unfortunately everything is ala carte, but will return & order the most important dishes that I really want. Great place to bring guests who enjoy seafood! Come early!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Friendly staff. Got our food within minutes. Josh our waiter was quick and friendly. Love the food!"}
{"text":"The quality is so fresh and delicious! Plus you get so much meat in the crab legs and can tell they choose the best crabs possible. The staff is always so much fun and attentive."}
{"text":"Hands down the best seafood I've ever had in my life!  You pick everything a la Carte and it's added to a plastic bag with the spices and flavorings choose then they steam the bags and bring to your table.  You open the bag to unleash a heavenly smell and piles upon piles of pure delicious crab, shrimp and lobster.  The waiter was goofy and made the meal fun as well!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times the flavors are great. Get ready to get messy depending what you order. I always get a lobster in a bag with some flavors in it. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a million times and give it the best rating each time if I could! I can never get enough of it. I often order it to go for lunch too. The food is great and the staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love Angry Crab! I don't like seafood, so I was hesitant to go, but I am so glad I did. I had buffalo chicken and it was wonderful. Everyone I was with enjoyed what they had. You order seafood by the pound and they bring it in a big bag along with whatever sauce you want. It's pretty cool. They don't have utensils, which freaked me out at first, but it was fine without them. The service was great and everything was clean. I 100% recommend Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on Friday and absolutely fell in love. We liked it so much that we ended up taking friends back the next day. This place has a great atmosphere,  great staff and great food. It was not over priced at all and we left very satisfied.  We had the snow crab, shrimp , mussels ,chared oysters appetizer, potatoes and corn on the cob and spent only a little over $50 for 2 people . That's not bad at all for sea food and They all were amazing.  I would recommend this place in a heart beat to friends and family."}
{"text":"My husbands new favorite place for seafood, but please bring back the Cajun Chicken sandwich. Best chicken I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom here on whim last night after reading a friends review and it was amazing! The food was fantastic and our server Matthew was just plain awesome! I got the king crab legs w/trifecta sauce and a Bloody Mary, the crab legs were huge and so yummy and the Bloody Mary was seriously one of the best I've ever had! My mom got the fried shrimp basket and she loved it! There wasn't a single thing I didn't like about this place,I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We Loved it!  Got the combo bag! They only have a few each day I guess. We were lucky and got the last one. It was Wonderful!  Bloody Mary on point! The one poor review on here I don't get. She must have been having a bad day. Service was great! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So delish, my husband and I have been 2 times.  We had garlic medium king crab legs and shrimp. Yum yum!  Taking a few of our family members tomorrow.  Can hardly wait ."}
{"text":"I am not a seafood fan but the food was fresh, it was packed(in a good way) server was great, seems everyone having fun, music and loud, so grab a drink and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my 5 yr olds birthday on January 28th.  It was wonderful, I walked in carrying a Spongebob birthday cake and they offered to put it in their refrigerator until we were ready for it.  In our party we had 4 adults and the birthday boy, everyone loved it and we all had so much fun.  The Servers were wonderful and Dominick was our Server and he was awesome. When Dominick brought out the cake he had even put candles on the cake.  the food was perfect and yummy.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Great service and excellent food. The Charred Oysters are a must get appetizer."}
{"text":"Craving fulfilled! The place was packed. We were told it would be 30 min but we really only waited maybe 10 so that was a plus! We were greeted by a friendly host staff and seated right away.   We were greeted by our server and she took our drink order. The place is very lively and interactive. Makes it fun for the patrons in my opinion. Birthdays, celebrations, etc all going on and the staff is sure to let everyone know to share in the joy.  Food came out in a timely manner even though all spread out. I guess with shrimp boil you do need to serve it hot, but it is a little weird to start eating when you know other people at your table haven't gotten their food yet. Even more so if your done and they are just getting started. To each is own I suppose.   I got a pound of shrimp trifecta medium. Next time I'll get hot the medium want very spicy. I know they use butter but only complaint was it  did taste very oily, again I know its butter so I guess it was just ALOT of butter.   All in all, wasn't bad and the service and interactive appeal of the place is really cool."}
{"text":"I had the King Crab in Trifecta sauce (0 spice level) and the \"bag\" with potato, corn on cobb and sausage. All eaten with my hands. Jim had the soft shell crab basket. Our first time. Highly recommend. Messy!! But they give you a bib and a roll of brown paper towels.  We'll be back.   Oh, and GREAT waiter - Bert. Personality plus!  See if you can get him. Quite a character."}
{"text":"Was unsure what to expect from this place at first, but now I love it. When you first come in, all of the tables are lined with butcher paper on top. There are no plates or silverware, but you do get a roll of paper towels (and you will need them).   The menu has bags, baskets, and platters. But the main attraction is definitely the bags. You can pick from a variety of seafood to pair with seasonings, spice, and sides (corn, potatoes, sausage, etc.). I went with the crab, and it did not disappoint. Both the snow crab and king crab legs were amazing. Plus, it's a lot of fun to crack the shells (definitely a stress reliever).   Overall, it is a fun, tasty experience. I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"I frequent the Angry Crab about Once a week. The fish is ALWAYS fresh and delicious. I have gotten the blue crab and the shrimp (always on the large size) in addition to the oysters both fried and raw as well as the fried clam strips and mussels. Everything is always fantastic! My only complaint is that the service is hit or miss and they need to bring back the grab bags! Other than that if you want fresh delicious fish GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have good seafood and a great time. Very fun atmosphere, and upbeat staff just adds to it. Our server Andy didn't miss a beat, and the manager Deanna was so nice and attentive. Tonight they had some unusually large lobsters going up to 7 lbs. We got a 5.8lb one and shared. They got the whole place worked up when they brought it out to us. It was gigantic! Suggest just a light garlic flavor boil on the lobster so you can enjoy its naturally great flavor. We also got a few different flavored snow crab boils to share. These are my favorite. Go check it out with some friends. It's a blast that tastes great!"}
{"text":"Fun place! I had the chicken tenders w/fries (not a fan of sea food but it was for my son's graduation and he loves this place)  Service was excellent and food was too!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place.  1. Because i was trying to find an alternative to Hot and Juicy and their horrible service. 2. Because the reviews are highly rated.  But to my dismay Angry Crab fell short. Very short 1 lb of shrimp - trifecta/medium spice 1 lb of shrimp - trifecta/angry ghost 1 lb of crawfish - trifecta/medium Steam rice I have tried many of these type of restaurants, Arizona, California and Nevada(las vegas). I know the flavors and what is good. Angry Crab really fell short with their sauce and spice. It wasn't very good: 1. Its extremely greasy. And i mean GREASY 2. Spice level is very low not spicy at all with a level of angry 3. Seasoning lacks, seemed very little Overall im disappointed. I probably wont try it again. Hot and Juicy is delicious but service leaves a lot to be desired(get takeout, you will avoid the disappointment but will enjoy the flavors).  Prices are the same on these two places.  I want to say the good reviews are based on people who haven't had much boils or on the other food items Angry Crab offers. But for their core food, its not worth it."}
{"text":"This angry crab honestly goes (everything is so bomb!), the staff is really friendly and everyone that works there makes sure that you're good even if they're not your server. My boyfriend and I have had both Brandons as our servers and they are so awesome! always attentive and super nice!"}
{"text":"My son and his wife went here to eat yesterday.  They loved it, he convinced me to try it.  I got the shrimp basket,  with baked beans.  It was all delicious!  Got it to go, told the gentleman it was the 1st time getting their food.  He asked me about the sides, he recommend the beans. I was not disappointed.  Will be back."}
{"text":"My family & I are extreme sea food lovers. Coming from the South, I know what a craw fish boil should taste like. Absolutely never eating here again... you could see the disappointment on everyone's face. Our server also clocked out & failed to mention we would have to flag someone else down for the bill. No No No"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here!  What a blast!  Food was great, decor fun, server fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sat at the bar, had some crab legs, a couple of drinks, and good Convo with Zac the bartender. Favorite spot in the Northwest Valley!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed eating king crab legs with my hands. A bit messy when you got right down to it but fun and flavorful. Got creative with a rock and smashing things open. Fun date night restaurant."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. If you like cajun and seafood this is the place for you.  The atmosphere is very festive and enjoyable. Truly made my experience."}
{"text":"Wow, so happy I decided to skip the chain restaurants and find a local restaurant on Yelp.  I had hopeful expectations that were surpassed.    Our server Alex and hostess Alexis were very friendly and went over the menu and explained everything.  We ordered the Shrimp (spicy level 1) and King Crab (spicy level 2) with the trio sauce that Alex recommended.  Both dishes were excellent and am looking forward to coming back again before we leave town.  There wasn't much difference in the heat profiles between the two and next time I will try level 3."}
{"text":"Place is always great!  Good food great service.  I tried something new and the one of the employees helped me by showing me how to eat a Dungeness crab correctly.  I would of have left a lot of meat on the crab.  I didn't even ask he just offered!!  Prob by my confusion on my face.  I didn't get his name, but thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Angry Crab Peoria and it's wonderful staff.  If you like seafood this is the place to go.   One of my favorite places to go.   I usually go alone and the staff treats me like I'm a party of five.  Always attentive and give great service.  Go now my friends and enjoy a great meal and great atmosphere.  Tip well!"}
{"text":"My hunny took me out for lobster for my birthday and it was delicious!  Our server Sam was awesome! If you are wanting some really good seafood and great service, this is definitely the place to go! The lobster, catfish, and muscles were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"not a very happy customer. food was great but the bartender was so rude needs people skills. We sat at the bar to eat, and she just set the beers on the bar all together so we handed with out to each other, then said we only can have one each because we drank too much, we are 60 years old, how could she judge us, Im guessing because of our age? then when our food finally arrived, I had to go around the corner to get our own napkins, because she didn't get us any. then asked for salt and pepper at least 3 times, never to get any, Then we left she bitched to one of our friends about our tip, which she lucky she got one in the first place, If we ever go back, we dam sure wont sit at the bar or order any drinks because we sure don't want to bother Ms little blonde, maybe we were to late in her shift where she didn't want to be bother or she wanted to go home, who knows"}
{"text":"First time, loved it. Great Crab. Didn't love the Trifecta. But so many options, you get it your way. Great staff. Sam (Samantha) was awesome. She knew her s#$@(seafood). We will be back. Again and again."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were greeted promptly before the lunch rush.  The atmosphere wasn't pretentious which was nice.  The server Brody went over the menu with us but spoke so quickly I had to ask him to repeat himself several times. Education about the menu was welcome though.  After ordering we shipped our drinks. When we needed refills we tried several times to make eye contact and wave down our server to no avail. My order arrive first  and Brody dropped it off and quickly left to another table . Then our server abandoned us for a larger group that came in after us. Brody was replaced by Jenna who was very nice and accommodating. She agreed to refill our drinks and check on the status of the remainder of our order.  In the meantime the manager stopped by our table. He asked how things were going. I honestly told him my snow crab was slightly overcooked but I wasn't going to waste it. I then asked why my companions Lobster wasn't started before the snow crab so that they could be served at the same time. The manager told me they serve it when it's ready that's how they do it here. And then says if there's anything he can do for us to let him know.  The lobster finally arrived and was overcooked. I definitely will not order snow crab or Lobster from here again however I may return to try out a po boy or a shrimp basket."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have tried other restaurants with the same concept but they all fail me. Everything is so good, even the kids meals that they offer. Very kid friendly. So far every visit we've had exceptional service from our waitresses and waiters. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, seafood is served in the bag and by the pound, and seasoned to your preferred spice level. You can add corn, sausage & potatoes. Snow crab and mussels were amazing! Shrimp was a little over cooked and it's served whole - so not deveined. The flavors were Cajun spice, it's very messy because you eat with your hands - use the bibs they give you! We had a long wait for 6, about an hour - turns out it was because they thought we said 7 people. Great quality food though, expect to spend about $100 for 2 people"}
{"text":"Sometimes a long wait but worth it! Our regular is the pound of shrimp and the oysters! Can you say yum?! The servers are a hit or miss, but the food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Been to other locations. .this one just opened up so we stopped in for a drink and a snack...sat at bar was quickly greeted . We ordered a Purple Haze and a Vodka Cranberry and gator nuggets.  Boyfriend loved the purple haze, there was very little vodka in my drink. The gator nuggets were ok they are deep fried they were a little heavy and I love gator. The bartender checked on us alot which was kidda annoying but it is her job...we like coming here so we will probably be back...but make sure you have money to spend ..it is quite pricey...."}
{"text":"We loved the Angry Crab Shack. The service was great. Everyone is so nice and peppy! Then comes the amazing food. We had the mussels and the crab legs in the trifecta sauce...oh my yummy goodness. We also had the clam strips which were clammy and delicious! Be prepared to get messy, but don't worry you get a bib and there's a communal wash area to wash away all that yummy goodness from your hands. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is darn good. The only reason one less star is because they kind of forgot some of our order and had to wait longer for the food to come through. Also the corn was cold. Other than that, friendly service, great food, and watch the spice level here, go one less than you think. They aren't kidding when they say angry crab. Go for the cat fish, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"So so food and a server who called my boyfriend \"bro\".  Chuck E Cheese is quieter.  Won't be back.  Joe's Crab shack is worth the drive.."}
{"text":"They have awesome service and awesome food! We watched as a group of people treated a server terrible and he handled so professionally. We also watched management treat them very professionally but also stand up to them! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Seafood! We had been wanting fresh beach-side seafood for awhile. The service was excellent, Alexis was so accommodating and was knowledgeable about the menu, food was fast, and so tasty! We got there around 6pm and got right in, when we left there was quite the wait, so the earlier the better. Seriously awesome, fresh, seafood and the spice combinations were great, the trifecta and pacific rim were so tasty! We wil be back!"}
{"text":"Ok.  Food ok. Service good. Not that fresh. Lobster disappointing. Maybe best to order fish."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Overhyped restaurant, the service was complete trash.  I recommend Hot N Juicy over this place. It Didn't satisfy and the prices were not great. Easy 100$ down the trash"}
{"text":"Great staff!!! Kudos to the management as staff seemed to really positive and happy to be at work.  Food was great.  I just can't say enough about the service.  Our server, Dominic, did a great job of going over the menu.  He also took the time to answer questions from the kids.  The treat of the night was Diana Banana bringing around the live lobster for the kids to check out."}
{"text":"We came during happy hour in the afternoon, it was supperrr busy! Despite the huge crowd out front we decided to wait for a table. It was an hour wait but they made up for it by giving us free appetizers, fried calamari and hush puppies. Calamari was cooked perfectly. Hush puppies were okay. We ordered two pounds of shrimp in trifecta with 2 sausages and 1 corn on the cob. They forgot to offer us gloves and bibs, make sure to ask cuz it gets pretty messy. Loved the food, good seafood, good fries, my friends thought trifecta was really spicy but I thought it was okay. The atmosphere was really loud and boisterous, lots of people. Waiters were nice. I came with a group of 6 so there was a 18% gratuity fee. Quite expensive, but I thought it was well worth it. Would love to come again."}
{"text":"Crab Fest !!!!...we had crab 3 times in 10 days. Was awesome, love everything. King crab was my favorite, with trifecta sauce, Sausages, & a couple Coors lights. Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fourth time coming here now and still never had an issue and always delicious. The price is fair and food is immaculate. The only problem I had this past visit was my own. Lol. We bought a Four Peaks beer glass and left it there. :( but other than that I've brought friends and family here and it's awesome. The servers and employees and super personable and fun to be around. I'll never go to a Red Lobster or Papaudeaux again. And special shout out to our waiter Nate. He recommended the dessert and it was the best. He was very funny and such a delight to be around. We hope we get him every time we come here. I love the Angry Crab Shack!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place always amazing no matter what you order.  The clams are always delicious fresh or baked."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Kieran (I think his name was. He's tall, white, and dark hair) he was great and absolutely nice and amazing. Great waiter and was very patient. We didn't know how to pay so we went up to pay and these to girls got real sassy and rude about things. Other then the two rude girls with attitude problem. It was great!! Ask for Kieran when you go!"}
{"text":"Was just in California, and had to come back to the desert to get this great food. Choose as spicy as you want. Get corn Sausage, and other goodies in your bag. New Orleans style restaurant great food not on the cheap side though. great for that special event wait staff really friendly and helpful. Andy, our server was great!"}
{"text":"Matthew the server was fun, informative and very attentive!   The vibe is casual, the right type of noisy.  The walls and tables all have writing and graffiti, very unusual and an entertaining change!   If you like seafood the way seafood was meant to be eaten you will like the angry crab!  Ask for plastic gloves so that your hands don't get too dirty! I personally loved the hush puppies and I enjoyed the items that did not have quite so much heat/spice.  If you like it Cajun hot then there are some perfect entrées for you too.  The Angry Crab  is a very popular spot for birthdays!  The servers make noise and bring a piece of cheesecake, they make it fun."}
{"text":"Had an issue with a special for New Years however received great customer service from the GM. I truly appreciate that he reached out to me and solved the issue! Thank you again and as always, food is delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The flavors were great. Some days they run out of everything i like real quick \"Get there early\" if you want the most common items"}
{"text":"Called tonight and placed a to-go order. Before I even placed the order, I asked the employee on the phone to confirm whether the crawfish was fresh or frozen and she said it was fresh. We're not from around here, so we were surprised that it was only $10 per pound.   After ordering $100+ worth of crawfish and finally getting the chance to try it at home, I find out it's frozen! I absolutely HATE frozen cf and had I known it wasn't fresh, I wouldn't have ordered anything at all. The one pound of shrimp I ordered was overlooked and mushy, but at least it was more edible than the crawfish...   The trifecta sauce was good, but my overall experience is a disappointment. The only positive thing is that the two bartenders provided exceptional service & I really appreciated the girl for double checking my order before I left.   1/5 stars for food quality."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me after my original review and went above and beyond to correct the bad service we felt we received. That simple action alone spoke volumes about how they truly care about their customers experience. We've since been back a few times and received wonderful service both times. We truly appreciated the effort the owner put into making up for us having a bad experience. We will always recommend Angry Crab Shack! Yummy food and a place that truly cares about taking care of their customers."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time ever eating at the Angry Crab! And I'll tell you what it was so delicious!! The crab legs were well-cooked the shrimp was spot-on and the vegetables were to die for! I will definitely be going back! And our waiter I can't remember his name sadly, was amazing for a party of 20!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a unique experience. Diner was a little on the pricy side but I ordered King Crab 30.00 a pound so it was the highest priced menu item that night.  Well go back but I recommend wearing very casual clothes. You eat with your hands so it's quit messy but very flavorful. Bibs are supplied to protect you shirt or blouse but be careful of staining your sleeves.   Have fun and enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last weekend. It's a laid back vibe with yummy seafood. Our server Brodey was fun and entertaining on top of that. The Kajun Bloody Mary has a bonus crab leg in it. I ate a dozen raw oysters in addition to the boiled bag of seafood. They were huge, but didn't have a lot of flavor. Just plan on getting messy here and you'll have yummy food with a good time."}
{"text":"Once again a great experience.  Snow crab was perfect.  Prepared perfectly and seasoned perfectly.  Never disappointed.  Service was good.  Celebrated birthday and had free slice of cheesecake.  First try of deserts it was good, but I think it was not prepared in house.  Tastes like every other resturants cheesecake ."}
{"text":"Best seafood in a long time. Reminds me of the east coast growing up. Family style and fun. Great service!! Lowen was our server and hooked us up."}
{"text":"Very good and awesome for the west valley! Loved the style of eating and atmosphere. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food!!  Great service.....Thank You Ashley!!  If you like medium hot...start with the mild.  The flavors were excellent!"}
{"text":"If I could have given 6 stars I would have. We got there around 8 and the wait was about 45mins...but I was with great company so the time flew by....the service was great and the food...well let's just say AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! Fyi if you are not a fan of spicy get a ZERO.....other wise it's gonna be hot...we ordered half the menu gator and EVERYTHING was good...Close your eyes and pick because no choice can be a bad one....Hands down the best place I've eaten at in the last 5 years...before that i lived at home...and all the meals were free and made by my mom..."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their choice of breading on the Shrimp Poorboy, greasy mush is what it felt like in your mouth. Shrimp and Snow Crab in a bag was too primitive for me.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Food is always great here but this time the service was horrendous. I sat down at 155pm, ordered fries for an appetizer and it still had not come out until 235. That's ridiculous for any place to take that long to serve an appetizer of fries. Also, the place was not busy what so ever .  Maybe 10 tables at most.  Not the servers fault, minus the fact that she was chatting away with a bday group. Regardless, i was very dissapointed for the first time coming here. Come on management!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. First time there. Brandon was our Server and he was great! The food was awesome, my wife had 2 Blue Crabs with white rice and I had Fish and Chips (2 pcs of Cod and Regular French Fries.). It was sooo good I ordered my meal again for 2nd helpings!! The atmosphere is a cross between Family & Sports-Bar. The price was awesome too! I know many places in the Valley where you can get crab....but not Blue Crab! Awesome place you guys!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our son and his family took us here for my husband's birthday.  Our expectations were high due to the reviews on here.  We were both disappointed.  The crab was completely over cooked to the point of being mushy and tasteless.  The concept is great, but they really need to get cooks in there that understand how to cook seafood.  For the prices they charge, I was expecting a lot better quality."}
{"text":"Came for dinner this past week.  Service was not as I expected.  Food came out at different times- baskets meals came out 15 minutes before the seafood bags did.  Finally told them to eat and not wait for us.  Server rarely visited our table.  Food, however, was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! We usually go to the Mesa location but this one is close to work so we stop here for lunch. The bags of seafood are awesome we love the trifecta seasoning with the hot sauce. Yum! This is a fun place and you eat with your hands right on the table."}
{"text":"The food was good. But the service was very poor. It seemed like a very chaotic scene. We had different servers at times. It was a Monday night too. You'd think it might be a slow night. Perhaps it's because Christmas is this week and everyone is out shopping. Who knows ?  After we were seated, it took about 20 minutes to be greeted by a server. My food order and my friends food order were delivered incorrect. I just had them deduct the error from the bill and not bother with a correction.  I had high hopes for this place. Maybe I'll go back someday.   I visited the Indian School road location once and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Nate and Allyssa were our servers and they were really attentive to our needs. Everyone from the hostess to our servers had excellent customer service. We started with the fried calamari for appetizer and the breading was the perfect balance of crispness and seasoning. For food, we had the lobster with the medium trifecta sauce and catfish with a medium lemon pepper sauce bags plus a soft shell crab po boy sandwich. All the food was cooked to perfection. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I thought about this, and to be honest with you.  It was okay, place needs improvement.  Unfortunately I have a benchmark to compare them to.  The other location is much better.  To me it seems that this location is like the ugly step child, does not get too much attention.  For example the tables look old and weathered, the shrimp that ordered was over cooked.  I would love for management go to the other location and take note.  The staff was on point Aaron was perfect."}
{"text":"First time here after only going to Joe's and hot and juicy crawfish  This place blew both out of the water. Amazing crablegs and the trifecta sauce was awesome. Even their non seafood was good, love the decor"}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing place! We got a lb  of snow crab with potatoes, sausage, and corn on the cob. It was all soo good! And so reasonably priced! It was about 22 dollars for all of that! We also got the cranberry mules that were so good. They tasted like cherry limeades with alcohol. And only six dollars during happy hour for a big mason jar full! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and everything is great the only thing that I was disappointed with is they don't have BBQ here so no chicken BBQ or no ribs ! Those are the ones that I usually order when I go to other location. Still love their Cajun fries, corn, BBQ beans and lot more. Great place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there today and we were really looking forward to some seafood and we were told they had great food.  Everything I wanted,  dungeness cracking, blue crab, red snapper and King crab legs were not available.  Wife ordered the soft shell crab, Cole slaw and comes with fries.  Thr only thing you could taste on the soft shell crab was the bread crumbs.  No coleslaw, as she brought out potato salad and the  fries were blah.  Everything tasted like grease.  Mine was the crab legs (NOT KING) and they were just okay, had much better elsewhere.  Expensive for blah food.  Told the waitress and only thing she did was write on the receipt was sorry you didn't like the meal.  Would have thought a manager would have come over to the table, at minimum.  Will never go back to this restaurant as we were very disappointed with the food and the staff."}
{"text":"Great asset to Glendale. It is a fun atmosphere, has great service and the food is consistent. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really fun at this place. The food is good, but the process of getting the food- eh. First, the food comes out 'as it is done', which in theory is a good concept, but when you are eating with kids and the adults food comes out first- well then you are in for some whining. Additionally, warm butter is considered 'food' and was served 10 minutes before the crab, which made it cold butter by the time said crab was dipped in it. Secondly, the crab-in-a-bag is DRENCHED in oil, it is a gigantic mess. They have gloves you can wear, but they won't offer them up, you have to ask.  If you order other things, eating them proves difficult as you are dripping in oil.  After two times of experimentation I now order them dry- there is no spice which sucks, but it's better than getting covered in oil. The breading on the oysters and alligator is just ok- a bit too spicy for the kids and honestly, since everything comes out as it is done, it seems like a race to eat stuff before it gets cold. Next time I will order things as I want to eat them, like appetizers, then meal. Also, some more vegetable/healthy options would be nice. The corn bread is delish and the Cheescake factory cheesecake is good. To summarize, food= pretty good, concept=could use some refinement."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally update a review based on something that was said on Yelp but the owner offered a gift card to make up for our experience at the Angry Crab and then never sent it.  Don't offer things if you can't/won't follow through, it's a great way to ensure someone won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice beer selection and delicious sauces! This is the go to place if you're a spicy fanatic like me! Try the trifecta with a #4... Yumm!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Can't say enough. Johnya was an awesome server and everyone made us feel very welcome.  My idea of service.  The food was fast and delicious.  I can still taste the flavor.  Can't wait to take my out of town guests here for dinner."}
{"text":"Tasty  Angry Crab Shack gives new meaning to the word casual. The formica topped tables are covered with white butcher paper, people eat with their hands, and writing on the walls is not only allowed, it's encouraged.  Angry Crab Shack has a team restaurant philosophy, food is delivered by the first person closest to the kitchen when the food is ready. I enjoyed ordering off Angry Crab's Menu. You pick your main course, which is sold by the pound. Then you pick your sauce, next you choose how spicy you want your entrée . The boil bag is brought to your table and everything is finger food. That's right, no utensils. You even get a rock to bash your crustaceans.  Thankfully a plastic bib is given and be sure to wear your bib, because you will need it.  The prices are reasonable and food is very good.  You should give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The most fun and delicious place if you love shrimp! The servers are accommodating and very friendly. My sister and I love their TRIFECTA SAUCE. I also like the sausage they put in there. The Sweet Potato Fries are also good. For dessert, their Red Velvet Cheesecake won't disappoint. Whenever we have visitors from out of state or special occasions like birthdays, it's Angry Crab for us!"}
{"text":"I love angry crab food and customer service is amazing! But this is not a baby friendly restaurant, Before i had  my baby i would come here 2-3 times a month its down the street from my house and I looooove their food, but since I've had my baby ive came about once or twice and the second time i had to leave before my food came out, my baby was sitting on the high chair and someone had a birthday so I understand the waitress was doing her job by singing happy birthday, which is not the bad part its the fact that they literally scream and ring some loud alarm which startled my baby so bad he was crying uncontrollably I really wish they would just sing a regular happy birthday song so it can be more baby friendly im sure i am not the only parent that avoids this place for this reason. Or maybe assign a specific area for families, i dont know but im really devastated i wont be able to come for a while due to this reason. Other than that if you are looking for great food and service and you dont have babies this is a great place to come!"}
{"text":"Can I get an ROTD for this one?!!  :)  It's a PARTY up in here!!  Angry Crab in Peoria continues to bring us regulars back and for great reason! I have said this before and I'll continue to replay it again...\"I don't know what's better? The staff at AC or their food?!\"  I have made the drive to their other locations prior to this latest opening of their franchise and it's either a good thing or a bad thing that I visit almost every other week.  The manager Will and staff/bartender Lowen (Mahalo!), along with the entire AC staff continuously bring it with the cheer, great vibes and it's just a very FUN atmosphere that locals and others abroad get together and have a blast. I have found that Friday and Saturday nights is guaranteed a great time.  I LOVE the flare of the decor in here and it's always a wonderful time with friends, family and even getting to know others out here.    Hands down recommendations: **Be patient if there is a wait, it's well worth it. (Hangout at the bar and chat it up & have a beverage). ** Sauce recommendation:  trifecta and LIGHT on the butter.  ** Spice level: to your liking. ** My favorite seafood items: snow crab, deep fried catfish, LIVE/FRESH crawfish, charred oysters, shrimp with the heads attached (I heard you can request for them to remove the heads). ** Other favs: hush puppies, sweet potato fries, red velvet cheese cake. **Alcoholic beverages: AC bloody Mary and or the Deep Eddy spiked ice tea with a squeeze of lemon.  Angry Crab deserves your business and it's ran privately. I am so excited and proud of the owners of this place and they truly do care and appreciate their customers and their staff.  I was recently relayed by a few staff members that the manager Will personally made and fed the staff breakfast burritos while they met for their company morning meeting. They also have other employee appreciation with their recent holiday Christmas party in January and shut down the entire location dedicated to their staff for the night with food, celebration and recognition. I feel GREAT being an ADDICT of AC-Peoria and supporting their values and wish them continuing success! They are about to open their Goodyear location and who knows where else they will branch out to outside of their current successful restaurants.  We enjoyed the festive Mardi Gras event tonight that had some sponsored items from Abita on tap beer from Louisiana! The (7) of us in our party scored on some Abita, Mardi Gras swag with each of us purchasing Abita beer, ironically we did this before the announcement of the offerings and we made out big time! We will be making it an annual Mardi Gras event with Angry Crab!  THANK YOU Angry Crab Peoria for ALWAYS providing excellence!"}
{"text":"I love it! I think its better than boiling crab in LA. Its a casual place which i really love. The food is really good! Tori was our waitress. She was really nice.."}
{"text":"If you love curry you will love the Pacific Rim sauce. My favorite is the Mixed Veggies and Snow Crab in Pacific Rim.  Great service and friendly crew."}
{"text":"If you're ready to get dirty shelling and eating seafood this is the place for you. Your table is set with a wax throw-away tablecloth that doubles as your placemat. Bags of boiled (by the pound) seafood (we had shrimp and snow crab legs) seasoned as you like are brought steaming hot to your table. Your hands are your utensils and there is an endless supply of napkins. Don't forget to don your bib- trust me you'll need it.   The drinks (non-adult beverages) are served in to-go cups with no lids. There is a wash basin on the back wall to clean yourself up when you're done making a mess.   We tried the hush puppies which were delish and a bit spicy. We also ordered veggies which came in a steamed bag. This is where utensils other than your hands would come in handy.  The veggies (as would be expected) are super hot and limp to hold and eat with your bare hands. Oh and did I mention the shrimp come whole with their heads and legs still attached?   Check the Angry Crab out on Mondays for their different boiled bag specials. A nice side note is that they are compost friendly so be sure to put the seafood discards and all paper products in the tin buckets at your table."}
{"text":"Great place lots of fun, delicious food, great waitress! Only down the hostess I spoke to on the phone simply couldn't understand what I was asking. I asked 3 times do you take reservations????. I mean how many times do I need to say do you take reservations? When she said yes she asked what time I told her and that it was for 2. She says oh we only take it reservations for 15.  First she shouldn't have asked me three times to restate \" do you take reservations\" and secondly she should've said initially we do take reservations for parties of 15 or more.  I felt like I was talking to person who had no clue about service.  Oh by the way my server was excellent I tipped her well."}
{"text":"Great place/atmosphere + hands on dining = FUN!  I usually order the pound of Snow Crabs but have also tried Dungeness Crab and Shrimp (1 lb).  They come in a bag, boiled with your choice of spice and you tell them how spicy you want it to be.  You can also add sausages, small corn on the cob, and/or red potatoes for extra charge.  I recommend red potatoes.   In my opinion, Snow Crabs tastes the best of all crabs.  The pound of Shrimp was good, too  but it just became too much to eat after about half way.  I've tried following spices:  Garlic, Kajun, Trifecta (garlic, Kajun, and lemon pepper), Sweet and Tangy, and Pacific Rim.  They are all pretty spicy to me, so I ordered Cajun with \"0\" spiciness.  It was too light so I would order the \"1\" spiciness next time.  I have tried Medium \"2\" and it's still pretty hot.  The Pacific Rim has curry-gingery taste.  Garlic was ok.  I prefer the Kajun =)  There was a wait to get in 2 times I visited but they can text you if you give them your number.  The wait didn't seem too long.  And after ordering your food, the wait isn't long if you order the 1-pounder bags.    I've not tried any of their other exotics, such as gators and frogs.  They also have po' boys and fish entrees.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Very fun experience.  Go in with the right expectations.  Seafood by the pound served with buckets for the shells. You eat with your hands and will need the bibs.   Ask for hand wipes if you need.  They offer a police/military/teacher discount of 10%.   The service was amazing.  The food was quick.  Our server, Regina, seemed to read every table well and may have been one of the best in a long time.   If you want long waits for expensive food, not your place.  If you want fresh seafood served by the bucket (yes they have tanks of Dungeness crabs), this is a hidden gem in the desert."}
{"text":"Good no frills seafood, friendly helpful servers... it's just a tad loud, but that's part of the fun."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Our waiter Brandon was the best providing suggestions on and offering little extras to food and drink orders. He gave us gingerbread snaps to dip in a beer (which was great) and when we ordered the cornbread suggested not only butter but gave us some honey. This was my first time at Angry Crab but I will be back. Ordered the snow crab legs trifecta and it was delish. Oh and the strawberry and mango daiquiri was also yummy!!"}
{"text":"Went one time so far, the wait is long but they have a bar to kill time. The food is excellent and portion is massive so go hungry."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff more words, more words, more words, more words, why does yelp require a certain line for review?"}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant with my group of people on a Thursday night.  Dave, one of the managers, called my home that morning to confirm our reservation.  When we got there our table was waiting and our server was excellent.  She went out of her way to accommodate us in every way.  I had a pound of shrimp, with the heads off, and ate with my fingers.  What a fun place to go.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The Angry Crab is awesome the food was wonderful and the atmosphere, employees and the family atmosphere that my son and wife enjoyed."}
{"text":"Such a fun environment. The staff is upbeat and friendly. I come here pretty often for date night. WE LOVE to bring our 4 year old who is a seafood fanatic. The brews are great as well. This is WAY better in comparison to Hot and Juicy Crawfish at Westgate. Their seafood was definitely not cooked properly! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Wow this was awesome - especially considering we just got amazing seafood in the middle of the dessert! Got the boil bags and yummmmmy. Just a tip \"wimpy\" on the spicy scale is pretty damn spicy (at least with the pacific rim sauce). Service was excellent, atmosphere fun and relaxed, music was great and chill/upbeat. Felt like we were on an island trip. I had to wash my hands BEFORE using the restroom - because the food is very hands on and messy, in a good way."}
{"text":"I had 1 lb of snow crab and 1 lb of shrimp both with medium spicy Trifecta sauce. They were AMAZING!!! Wished they have garlic bread as side order."}
{"text":"It feels so right to throw away the plate and eat right off the table! I even got to write my name on the wall! Best crab legs I have had in Arizona! The servers are always smiling and the food is spectacular. You have to try the Gator!"}
{"text":"This review is not necessarily for the food. (Only because I'm really not fond of shell fish of any kind.) I decided to take my son here because he does I had decided to go ahead and try it out. What impressed me was the wonderful service received. Our waitress was wonderful. When I explained to her that I wasn't a shell fish eater she encouraged me to go ahead and try it and if I didn't like it I could try something different. I ordered the Crayfish and my wonderful waitress helped me decide how to season it. She was so patient with my indecision that it set me completely at ease. When she brought out our meal she then continued her excellent service by explaining how to crack the shell to get to the meat. While my son devoured his lobster I started in on my crayfish. Did I mention before that I'm not fond of shell fish? My son loved it but it really wasn't my taste. Our waitress came back and I embarrassingly explained to her that I really didn't like the food. She was so understanding and allowed me to return what I ordered and I ended up with a fish sandwich. (Much better) She removed the charge which was almost $15.00 dollars which I believe was above and beyond. I had been completely willing to pay for since I had ordered it. This wonderful waitress is the reason I'm giving this resturant a five star rating. So If you like crayfish this is definitly the place to go."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is great and a lot of fun! Lobster, shrimp, crab, all really good!"}
{"text":"I really wished they had crawfish available during this visit...but nonetheless the service and food was great! I think we went through boxes of gloves peeling the shrimps but it was delicious...trifecta!"}
{"text":"I think the food is average, slightly over priced but that's what you get when you're in the middle of the desert. It was a great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Didn't care for our original server Adam. He wasn't very attentive. Thankfully Zach took over. He was great. The oysters & wings are great. Probably won't do the per pound deal again as I don't feel you get your money's worth. May or may not return. If I do I'll remember to bring my old bay seasoning."}
{"text":"Best seafood in town, new Orleans style..highly recommended. Will eat there again , the crawfish was amazing"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Not only the food but the environment , service and experience as well. Quite entertaining. Food was killer! Definitely see myself becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"They have delicious food, great prices, friendly service all in a very clean, decorated resturaunt."}
{"text":"This is a poor attempt at casual Cajun dining. We were on vacation from Dallas. After 3 try's at getting my order right the shrimp was over cooked. All the food is served in a plastic bag which was a bit of a turnoff.  Way over priced mediocre quality. Also everything was drenched in sauce. Beer selection was nice but still overpriced."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my lunch today at Angry Crab. Certainly not with the 50 bucks I was charged. Even though I received two free desserts (which are not worth the money  they are charging for them). Cold French fries, terrible menial \"brown mustard\" on the Po-Boy. The location on Indian School was always so good, but this location is failing. Especially when it's not busy, the service and food should not be lacking."}
{"text":"The food was good. I wasn't too impressed with the sauce that was used. The sauce was a bit oily and lacked texture. The 1Ibs bag of shrimp mite of been a bit short of a pound. I think Hot n' Juicy mite have the edge over these guys. The service was good."}
{"text":"Oh my; this restaurant is fun ! Waitresses/waiters very friendly and content. A metal bucket (for trash eventually) is brought to the table filled with one pound of thick, fat snow crab legs (with tools) and  one pound of huge shrimp brought to the table in a bag with chosen sauce (I recommend Trifecta) at the #3 hotness level ( burns the lips but it does not last long). I also recommend the boiled veggies in lemon pepper sauce ( in a bag) ; peppers, squash , jicama, yucca I think , snap peas, pineapple, lemon, and more!  Delicious! Eat on the paper table cloth with your fingers and a protective bib! Yes yes it was a unique experience for me; I am glad there is an Angry Crab closer to my house because I am going again soon."}
{"text":"We come here almost every week the fish is fresh and the drinks are cold. There seasoning blends are phenomenal and if you go past a 2 in spice be prepared to sweet. I just wish they would go back to there Monday night grab bag specials. Other than that it's perfextion"}
{"text":"Angry crab never seems to disappoint. Great and atmosphere with absolutely amazing food. Don't bother dressing fancy, you'll be wearing a bib anyways. Food is messy but the flavor is amazing."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  Everything we had was delicious.  Snow crab, onion rings, hush puppies, everything!  The manager was great. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"If I could give a million stars, the would get EVERY SINGLE ONE! First of all, this was my first seafood experience with the buckets and sauces and all that and I loved it! Never heard of this place, read the reviews on here and had the best time ever. I am not fucking around here kids, BEST PLACE EVER. Why was it amazing you ask? Well lemme tell you... The service was awesome. We had Val as our waitress but I think we met the whole staff because people kept coming over to talk to us and ask if we were doing good. So very attentive. Next lemme tell you about the bloody Mary's. Not only was it delicious but there was a crab leg sticking out of it. Yes, a big old fucking crab leg sticking out of it and it was so good! We ordered the bucket with crab legs, shrimp (which you can order headless, which is a great choice because who wants their food staring back at them?) and muscles.  You order a sauce with them which was called the trifecta and it was so yummy. So yummy in fact that I wanted to take it home and rub it all over for another good time but we will save that for another review.. Haha!! And if you go there on your birthday they make crazy bell sounds and the whole place gets crazy. It messy eating but the most amazing crab legs that I've ever eaten and they give you a rock incase shits too tough for the scissors. Yes a rock! We are now regulars, and go on a payday because it's not too cheap but SERIOUSLY worth every penny. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loveeeee their food and staff. I'm never hungry or unsatisfied after going out to eat here. The Trifecta sauce is a must have!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband both had king crab legs trifecta mild. We like spice and were completely happy with the mild. They are not kidding about the spice so be careful. The flavor was great. The crab was great. Service not bad. The restaurant was really cute. I like how they have the writing all over the walls. Patrons can write on the walls. Just something fun and different."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even better food. You will be hard pressed to find seafood as fresh as this anywhere else in Arizona. The boils were absolutely top notch (so much butter!). Had Steve as a waiter and we knew that he was busy but we felt like we were his only table. He was so personable and totally went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. The manager \"Diana Banana\" and the blonde hostess with glasses (didn't catch her name) were so friendly!  Steve told us about a secret Traditional level 6 sauce with Carolina Reaper peppers. It lit me up, but I could not stop eating it! The head chef (who doesn't like being called a chef) is a genius of sauces. There was so much flavor and so much heat packed into that sauce.  The beer selection is unparalleled; you can tell that every craft beer, most of which are local, were specifically picked to go perfect with the food.  We have been loyal H'nJ patrons, but we have just found our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"So bummed about my first experience here. Waited to go here with my husband for weeks and was utterly disappointed in the service and entire experience. We were there in total for 2 hours and ended up leaving with empty bellies and no desire to ever come back. We waited 30 min to get a seat which was fine, then we were seated and ordered our food quickly. We ordered a boil bag with snow crab and veggies, after about an hour we asked the waitress if it was coming anytime soon. Her response was, soon and then half hour later we decided it was definitely long enough to wait for food and was time to leave. I was facing the direction towards the kitchen and could see they had forgotten to make our order. When we asked to cancel our order our waitress apologized but the manager who had to confirm our cancellation never said one word to us. They never tried to make it right and left us with a bitter taste for this restraunt. We walked out from our date night and had to go somewhere else to get food before getting back home to the babysitter. Bummed out and very disappointed."}
{"text":"Service sucked. It's like everyone has a stick up their ass. The guy manager has no personality and is probably the reason why everyone looks like they have a stick up their ass.  Food is alright, honestly if you're looking for good service and good food just go to hot n juicy!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I can say the staff and the food was amazing. I got personal lessons from Mike on how to open crab legs properly so now I can say I'm a pro. Definitely wanna bring back my entire family back so they can experience the fun I had today. Thanks, for the fun, amazing food and good hospitality."}
{"text":"Hello all  We came here Friday night, 3/16, for my birthday. It was around 7? And a hella long wait. About 1 hour. We have been dying to try it though so we stuck it out. It was actually pretty cool though as they text you when there's a table ready. And with that, it actually gives you a website that you can check on your phone to see an estimated wait time and how many parties were ahead of you. We thought that was pretty awesome.  When we were greeted and seated, Cam was our server. We noticed all the writing on the walls and tables and immediately felt comfortable since this place seemed like it was fun and wasn't a for-serious people only establishment.  Cam explained the menu and how everything worked. He recommended a few things to try. We got a pound of shrimp in lemon garlic and a pound of snow crab in the tri-fecta (which is a blend of lemon, cajun, and garlic, I think, I'm not an expert or nothing). Our son got the mac and cheese and fries. We also ordered a side of cornbread. Actually 3 sides of them at $1 a piece. It was some good cornbread. Our child was actually shoving them in his mouth. It was the cutest thing!  The cajun fries were bomb, too and if you ordered a side of them, some proceeds goes to the children's hospital (if memory serves correct).   The food came out quick, hot, and delicious. The crab was great. The shrimp was great. It was all around a good eat.  Cam made sure we were well taken care of and was so fun and friendly. There was a few staff members we interacted with and they were all really cool. I could tell this place is all about great food and having fun and we will definitely be back. After the paper mats on the table were removed, we saw all the writing and Cam seems to be very popular lol. He's a great dude.  I got a cheesecake for my birthday and a shout out, too. So embarrassing! I tried to get out of it but my wife wouldn't let me. All in good fun though. There was an old couple a few seats away and they were also celebrating. It was cute!  Don't be discouraged by the wait time. There's a reason for it."}
{"text":"Everything I order was great except the gator nuggets, they were pretty nasty compared to other places I have had fried gator. I will be going back just won't order any fried gator! Went back today (11-13-15) and had the Catfish basket and I have to say it was great. The staff is hella dope great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is not your typical seafood and BBQ place. It's a hands on experience LOL so dress accordingly.  Served family style where the table is covered with a sheet of paper as an all in one clean up. There are a wall of sinks for you to easily clean up. Food served in a plastic steamed bag. You may not need the bib but will go through a ton of napkins LOL but seriously you will.  Great food and fun sports bar type atmosphere, so lots of TVs. Cajun fries and hush puppies tasty. The crab legs and shrimp are yummilacious (disclosure...the Shrimp are Deveined so if you are not a fan of having to devein, stick with another item). They have Mussels King, Crab, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs, Chicken, Shrimp,  Lobster, Snow Crab, Oysters, Craw Fish can be served with corn on the cob, sausage and red potatoes. Try the trifecta sauce (I did the mild heat) which was perfectly seasoned.   Overall...Good casual fun dining experience with tremendous food and amazing specialty drinks company by OUTSTANDING customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate special occasion for daughter. Food, atmosphere and service was outstanding. Oysters were to die for as was the shrimp boils and crab."}
{"text":"Great overall-  I'm just pissed I spent this much and had to fight to share silverware to eat my king crab..  when the bill came I didn't say \"sorry, someone stole 10% of my money this week!   FIX THIS PLEASE"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great place to go with a group of people! Mix it up with peel your own shrimp and some King Crab Legs - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I love the service, the environment and the prices. Excellent place to party with friends or to bring the whole family, kids are welcome.   The Angry Crab makes Joe's Crab Shack look like amateur hour.   Warning: The food is so damn spicy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! The food is delicious but the staff made the night truly amazing, they work together, they are on top of everything and really know how to have a good time!! Love this place. We wanted to go here for a while but hadn't had the chance until tonight. I wish we had come here a longggg time ago. It was delicious, the crab lobster oysters and frog legs filled us up and we have left overs. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"SO fun! Don't go if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner. This place is loud and obnoxious and exciting and delicious. Order fresh seafood, by the pound, season to your liking, and dig in. We chose hushpuppies, 1 lb. snow crab with butter on the side, 2 pounds shrimp (complete with heads) with Trifecta seasoning and mild heat, and a Cod basket. It was all wonderful! The Cajun Bloody Mary is also delicious but pricey at $10."}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant on the West side. Fresh seafood and fun atmosphere and friendly service. The snow crab legs with medium trifecta sauce is a perfect blend of spice and heat. The beer is always cold and the staff are always friendly. It's a loud place so be prepared it's a party always ready to happen."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT. We found this place searching Google Maps. We ordered the Trifecta crab and shrimp boil bags. It was super flavorful, came out hot, and really fun to eat with your hands. Our servers were attentive and super friendly. I'm a teacher and we got a teacher discount!!!! We will definitely be coming back!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Seafood, seafood, seafood! Not a lot of places in Peoria to grab some good seafood my bed is this is the best place.  Came on a Friday night and the whole place is pretty packed waiting wasn't so bad though. I got shrimp and fries and the price was pretty spot-on for the value. My buddy got the barbecue and he said it was pretty good.   In my experience there is not a whole lot of really great seafood places Peoria but this one's got it nailed down. Atmosphere is okay, mostly just table seating couple TVs and decent service."}
{"text":"I went there for a pick up today. The female cashier had an attitude. She didn't great me back. She gave me a look. If you hate your job so much why you don't leave it for somebody else? Instead of pushing the costumers away?"}
{"text":"This was our first time at an Angry Crab Shack.  We were on the west side of town for an appointment, and did not want to drive back to Fountain Hills during rush hour.  Clicked on Yelp for nearby restaurants and found this one with 4.5 stars.  We had heard that this chain was pretty good, so headed over. First, let me warn you that it is easy to miss this restaurant if you aren't paying close attention. It is in a small shopping area nestled in residential area. We were greeted by the hostess when we walked in, but headed toward the bar.  Alex, the young woman at the bar, was outstanding from start to finish.  She is so pleasant, very polite to both guests and coworkers, and has a lot of knowledge about the company.  We sat for over an hour enjoying her company and the food. We shared a fried shrimp basket, and the shrimp was outstanding.  Better than any I've had away from the Gulf Coast.  Loved their cocktail sauce, which had lots of horseradish. Do yourself a favor and head to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are in love with angry crab. Had shrimp with trifecta and fried shrimp basket. Both were amazingly delicious. BBQ beans was beyond expectations. Staffs were cool and place was neat and overwhelming. Waiting to try more flavors from here."}
{"text":"My wife and I were first timers to Angry Crab. We ordered the fried clams and she ordered a pound of king crab legs, and I a pound of snow crab legs.  The fried clams came out very quick.  There was a fair amount however, they were fried beyond done, to the point of rubber bands! The crab legs came shortly afterwards and our waitress was somewhat confused as to which was which.  Each bag was marked however, the snow crab legs were much bigger than the king crab legs. I am thinking they were miss-marked?!  The food gets a meager 3, the decor a 2 and overall experiance a strong 2.  For a $73 lunch, you can find great food, impecable service with eating utensils and a vibrant atmosphere elsewhere.  Sorry, but we can find much better."}
{"text":"Very good seafood Clams mussels shrimp served in a bag . The fish was very tasty and the sauces were excellent Absolutely delicious The king crab also great"}
{"text":"We love angry crab! We moved just down the street from the Peoria location a year ago. We go about once a month. Service is always good. Food is always great. Love the charred oysters. Love the catfish basket. Always our go to place if we have out of town visitors. If you like seafood, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"If you are at the Angry Crab Peoria, find the table near the back... I drew a picture of Kylo Ren from Star Wars: The Last Jedi wearing no shirt. You'll see it easily.   FOOD:   Anyways, there are tons of these kinds of places in LA, so I figured why not. We ordered a bunch of the steamed food - crab legs and shrimp. Also ordered alligator because I wanted to try it. Or, was it crocodile. It was one of them- and taste like chicken. The good is pretty good if you are craving a lot of seafood and fast.   Don't get the beans. They are messy as f. I should have gotten coleslaw. Anyways, the price is a little high, but I expected it from here because I live near an ocean in LA so it's cheaper. So, I feel like it was a fair price for being in Arizona.   SERVICE: Standard. Nice service.  AMBIANCE: Very laid back and bro-y. It's loud and public, but it's fine. Fun for partying.   PARKING: Tons  OVERALL: Good"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time last night, a Tuesday night. It was a wonderful experience and delicious food! It's a fun, family friendly environment with hodgepodge decor and a great Cajun, backyard style feeling. Our server, Hannah, was the icing on the cake! Friendly, helpful, sweet, etc! We were both so impressed with the place, the food, and all the servers. We will definitely be back with our friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this for date night. A few of my friends recommended it. A few things to note Pros: taste great, fresh seafood.  Cons: 45 minute wait, plastic silverware, paper cups. I ordered shrimp not knowing it comes with legs and a head. Ew. I was later told after not eating it (and still paying for it) that there is an extra $2 fee to have the heads removed. Oh! And the \"mild\" spice will light your mouth on fire. And I LOVE spicy stuff. The fried clams were over cooked and I do not recommend them. Your food comes in a small plastic body bag. No plates.  So, for 1 lobster, 1 king crab, 1 snow crab, 1 headed/legged shrimp, fries and a margarita we paid $150+30tip. We probably won't be back..."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we loved it. The atmosphere was fun and energetic. The people were super friendly. Our waiter was helpful and attentive. I had the snow crab with corn, sausage, and potatoes the sauce choice was called trifecta Cajun style mild. My order came bagged full of deliciousness. Hubby got catfish basket with fries and beans. The crab was fresh and yummy seasoned so great. The corn was sweet and sausage flavorful. The catfish had great seasoning with a nice crust. The Coca-Cola was strong and great to wash it all down. This place is affordable for seafood and lots of fun. The best part was when they toured a live lobster around to each table and ppl took selfies. Perfect for families, singles, and even a fun date night if you're ok with getting messy :)"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.  I'll keep  this simple... food was amazing (I dream about the king crab), spice it the way you want it!!  Staff was amazing and fun.  Eating with your hands, scissors and a rock amused me to no end.  I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Yummmy. If you are down to get dirty this is the place for you. When we lived in Cali we would go to places like this all the time. So you can already tell we were very excited to eat here. My husband and I each got a pound of snow crab and shared a pound of shrimp. I love that they give you the slay and pepper with lemon.( yummmy) We did the trifecta with mild spice. Along with an order of fires well done. Ok so you can tell the crab comes in frozen only bc the lack of meat and the excess amount of water you get when you crack open the crab legs. But everything is super yummy has a lot of flavor I really like the spice level the sauce that comes with. I really can't wait to go back and eat some more crab legs!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was TORI and that's why we give this a five star rating. After discovering it was our first time to Angry Crab, she proceeded to very patiently explain all the goodies that were in store for us. We were in time for happy hour, which is from 3-6p which was a definite bonus. We had just gone to a fancy steak restaurant a couple of nights before and Tori provided much better service than they did. She stopped by on several occasions to make sure all our needs were met. We came in sad and hungry and left delighted and satisfied. Can't wait to bring all my out of town friends and neighbors here to meet Tori."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks and beer on tap. Family and kid friendly, good for large groups. Servers are friendly and polite, but sometimes feel like they are rushing us out. Likely because this place is usually packed."}
{"text":"The food was average my service was below average the only thing that was consistent was the waitresses opinion of how bad the kitchen was doing and my Tea refills. If you choose to go eat at the crab you will need to use your patience skills."}
{"text":"I love this place, and go way more than is appropriate. The hosting and wait staff are always excellent, and the food I've had is delicious every time. My go-to items are snow crab-trifecta-0, cajun fries and sometimes hush puppies. I do wish they had the macaroni and cheese the Phoenix location has, but there's plenty on the menu to satisfy. LOVE."}
{"text":"Just got back from having dinner there. I had a wonderful experience as usual. Nothing but upbeat happy vibes, good music and friendly staff. I think the owner came to our table 3 times to check on us tonight. I saw her mingling with other tables letting them know about happy hour and different specials. I have never seen any manager/restaurant owner do that before so it was surprising in the best way! She let my boyfriend and I take a picture with a live lobster she was carrying around! I really enjoy this place. I will always come back."}
{"text":"I swear every time I've been here when visiting Surprise, Az and living here, I've never been disappointed or decided that the wait was too long, because it was always worth it.   I don't remember our severs name but he was an old dude with glasses and that night was wearing overalls (see pic included). He was soooo  awesome!!!!! He put on all our bibs and constantly filled our waters before we could go empty. He was very silly with us! And made sure everything was taken care of.  The taste and quality of the food is always on point whenever I eat here, and although it's always busy coming in, the wait for food after being seated and  ordering is never too long and just right. I always get the shrimp with trifecta and it's always just as good, maybe better, than the first time I came.   Love the atmosphere of the place, the personalities of the staff and craziness that takes place with the alarms and whatnot! Great place for groups of friends!"}
{"text":"This was TRULY bad food.   I'm from the east coast near the ocean and this was the equivalent of NY pizza to Dominos.  Wow was it bad!!! The crab was over cooked and the sauces were over powering  Corn had zero flavor and tasted days old. The employees were pleasant enough although we didn't get any utensils ( plastic is served ) until well into the meal. We will never return. For the longest time thought it had a good rep and was eager to go. Never again. Worst hundred dollars I've spent in a good long time"}
{"text":"Service was great as was the food. The Cajun sauce was AMAZING! I could eat that sauce on stale bread and still be happy."}
{"text":"We pick this place because of the yelp recommendations and they did not fail us.   The boils, the shrimp & Oyster po'boy, fries, catfish, and claims all so yummy... this is a must have when in AZ"}
{"text":"Quality downhill, used to be great. Pure garbage now. Been going here since the day they opened. The last year or so had 3 bad experiences at this location. Ranging from sitting for 20 mins and never even being acknowledged to Crab that is severely undercooked and cold. Not to mention the useless GM that is likely the cause of this quality slide. Bottom line, I loved this restaurant from day 1. It was 5 stars solid for the first year or so. They used to bring your food out as it was ready. Now they bring it all together likely undercooked and cold. Avoid this place unless you like poorly run establishments that will give you a garbage product.   I will never give this place another chance which is a shame because I live in the area and use to recommend it highly to everyone. Won't even go back for the great beer selection as I am not interested in giving this place another penny of business."}
{"text":"This place is the best. My partner and I had a great experience here. The food was amazing and so was the service. They were very attentive, our waiter had to clock out and came over to introduce our to our new waiter. She was just as great as our original even though she was going to get paid out on the tip. Definitely worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Best service ever!!! Absolutely love this place. Our waiter Demetri was amazing. He even brought a lobster out and talked to my kids about lobsters. My son was super excited. Thank you. Service was above and beyond."}
{"text":"Es mi primera vez y sinceramente es un lugar con un buen ambiente, la comida está deliciosa lo que sí puedo decir es que si crees que te encantan las comidas picantes lo pienses dos veces antes de ordenar el picante número 5  en verdad pica y lo dice una Mexicana que ama lo picante, el servicio es excelente muy amistosos, volvería? Si claro sin dudarlo!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor.  The service was great and food really good. Only downfall was they were out of crawfish which we wanted to try. I would definitely return for more! :)"}
{"text":"UPDATE * * * * Stopped by for a Father's Day brunch. I had the trifecta mixed bag special, very flavorful and delicious! AMAZING SERVICE! Big thank you to our server Alicia for being so attentive and charasmatic, Brody stopped by too, very helpful as well. Hostesses were also very attentive Anna and Olivia. Thank you for the overall experience, will be back very soon!          Such a great place to eat.  If you don't mind getting your fingers a little messy, then you are golden! Service was amazing, very attentive staff, and food was served in in about 10min after ordering! Love the environment and the walls give it a personal touch from everyone who has visited!  Overall great place to eat at a reasonable price!  I will be visiting again"}
{"text":"California representative here. Just thought I'd throw that disclaimer out there, since my critiques are based off the comparisons of The Boiling Crab and CrabHut.   This place is ok. The price is pretty much the same as its competitors. The taste... Far from it. We ordered the Trifecta #2 for our three lbs of shrimp (oh btw they don't do half lbs here). Hardly a trifecta of three flavors when all you taste is butter. The biggest difference is they don't use fresh garlic!! Their garlic seems like it came from the precut jars you get from Costco... in other words, it totally lacks flavor. Not to mention how unappetizing your meal gets as you notice the sauce start to harden on the placemat. Nothing like clogged arteries to make you feel good about your life decisions.   The only thing this place has going for them is the actual shrimp. They're large, they're not over cooked (*cough* CrabHut) and they're seemingly fresh. How you get fresh shrimp in Arizona... I'll never know.   If you ever get a chance, visit The Boiling Crab. The place has to put crack in their sauce because as soon as you leave, you crave it. Angry Crab didn't have that effect on me."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. I was so excited when I sat down and got my delicious bag of crab legs, crawfish and shrimp. We gobbled it down and it was so tasty. Within 20 minutes of getting home, I had major stomach issues that lasted 36 hours.  I will say, the trifecta seasoning is extremely intense even though we ordered a level one spiciness. I think I will give it one more try and try a different seasoning... But for now, I'm still recovering.  I had to update this review because I realized shortly there after that I had contracted a stomach virus that wasn't related to this meal. It lasted for eight solid days LOL. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I'm quite particular about my seafood and this place exceeded my expectations! The oysters were a great start and the main course was simply amazing! Service went beyond your typical place and I have to say they impressed me all around. They even went as far as to comp my wife some extra sausage, corn and potatos when her original order was simply too spicy for her. It was totally her fault for choosing it but they wanted her to have a good eating experience. Something that seems rare is now at this restaurant. Its now on my favorites list!"}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp po boy and it was pretty good. The decor reminds me of Louisiana and  the service is very good here. They are all very attentive. Next time I will try the seafood by the pound."}
{"text":"Went to other location a month ago, super tasty! Went to this one and was surprised it didn't have the smokehouse meat section that Indian School Ed had.  BUT, food was still amazing!  Snow crab legs in trifecta with added sausage is, by far, the most amazing meal for the price I have ever had.  Messy, yummy, filling, and fun with friends!"}
{"text":"Great flavor and even better service! I ordered blue crab not knowing any better and decided right away that I did not like it (not the kitchens fault) and then ordered the snow crab legs in addition. The waiter noticed I didn't touch the blue crab and offered to comp that part of my meal. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. The soft shell Po boy is amazing. No wonder this place has 4.5 stars.   The price if is very cheap too. It's very nice inside. It fits the theme very nicely. Never knew this was so close to my house!   I forgot to ask if they have happy hour, but I assume they do. If was up to me this restaurant should have 5 stars!   Will definitely come back. Thank you for the great service :)"}
{"text":"Our first time trying Angry Crab & we really enjoyed the atmosphere. But best of all the delicious food, My favorite is the pound of shrimp, trifecta sauce, medium hot, and the corn on the cob."}
{"text":"I must say Iv been here at least 20 times and god damn that boy Nate he always amazes me on each visit, very happy and greets everyone not just his tables because he takes pride of his restaurant. He is my favorite server I come here with my girlfriend and he is a excellent server. It's weird for a white kid havin a Afro but he can definitely pull it off. Anyways i always get their fried catfish meal with them beans YES damn I'm about to go there again soo good. This place Angry Crab my favorite restaurant hands down one of the best. Good job keep it up. Love everyone there food always on point both and not one bad visit yet very satisfied!"}
{"text":"So much fun to eat here. You get a large rock to crack the shells.  Everyone has a great time. The seafood is perfect with the seasoning you chose. You will have to shell the food."}
{"text":"I had oysters, crawfish, crab legs and shrimp all were phenomenal!! I personally like the trifecta. The atmosphere is fun.l and casual."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not one for bad reviews but this is kind of a must. We've been here twice and got our order wrong both times we've been here. Then, even after the fact of bringing it to managements attention, we were being talked down to being told that we \"ordered wrong\". After waiting over 30 minutes for my \"correct order\" to come out I gave up. The only thing the manager did for us was take $10 off our bill. We appreciate your \"professional courtesy\" but we won't be visiting you again. We gave a another shot because your food was great, but no delicious entree is worth this stress or headache."}
{"text":"My husband loved this place ! I like how they are very upbeat and friendly our waitress Emily was very informative when we let her know this was the first time we had been here.She let us know all the specials what not.   The only con which is not a con it's just my preference that they would have more non seafood items (I know why did you go to a seafood spot if you are not a fan) my husband and kids LOVE seafood and I'm not too much of a fan ."}
{"text":"Went there for an early Valentine's dinner.  Plenty of seating and the staff very friendly. We were going to order two separate meals but the waitress said they had a Valentines special which included two small lobster tails. We ordered that and a lb of king crab legs. The two tails were REALLY SMALL  so small they ended up over cooking because we left them in the bag until half way through our meal.  We asked for level 1 heat which is mild but what is still with us is far from mild. I suspect we had level 2. Where's my Tums?  For the price we paid and the end product (the lobster tails) I would say it was too high but the food was OK.  If we go back we will probably order just the crab legs which were OK. Just a bit too cooked. Maybe pull the bags a minute earlier because it does continues to cook for several minutes after being delivered to your table"}
{"text":"Love the angry crab. Good food fun atmosphere. Family friendly. The staff is always nice and food is always fresh and good."}
{"text":"Finally open in Peoria! I have been to the other locations but they are really far away for us. This location opened yesterday and did not disappoint at all. The food is incredible and this location seems to have a couple extra options the others do not. If you have never been here and like seafood you MUST come here. If you have already been here you know exactly what I am talking about. A+++ all the way."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes to sit, which is ok since we had a table of 19. However the service was terrible. There was mass confusion getting our order, where half the table got their food before the other half even got to order. Our nephew didn't get a water for another 20 minutes.   Just not cool, and didn't get any consolation from staff, they were just oblivious."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a quick dinner. Food and service by Regeana was amazing. We get back to the car and realize my husband's wallet is gone. To make a long story short, the manager brought us to her office and allowed us to look through the cameras with her and she along with 2 other employees dug through trash cans with us until we were able to find it. It was completely our fault and they still did everything and more to ensure we left with our wallet. We even insisted on tipping them for their work and they insisted on buying a family in need groceries with it! We will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Just love this establishment!  The food is fresh and always comes out hot!   Recommend your first time always order a bag it's the best! Crab legs are so delicious!!!   My husband loves the shrimp and they are huge!"}
{"text":"116 Yelp Reviewers were right, this place rocks! Casual, good, well priced and fun. Where else can you get generous wine pours in a mason jar?! Hush puppies with jalapeño in them were yummy. Had the fried shrimp basket. All was perfect including red velvet cheese cake. Don't forget to ask waitress for a Sharpie to add your name to the wall. Get there early!"}
{"text":"I wish I can do negative stars for this place considering the way I feel this morning and how I felt all night for that matter. I visited the angry crab last night. I have eaten there before and hadn't been that disappointed but all that changed now! My order was 2 pounds of crab and a lobster! The chunky bag of seasonings that arrived at our table should have raised a red flag but I ate anyway! I remember thinking why is the spices so chunky when it's lemon and butter it's like they plopped it in there. This morning this chunky mess ended up in the toilet because I got food poisoning!  Won't be going back ever again. This might have to do with our visit being close to closing time either way something was not right last night."}
{"text":"Perfection. If you ate anywhere else in Peoria you wasted your money. Fun atmosphere unparalleled crab and seafood and just an awesome experience.  Also cheaper than and 100 x's better than any other seafood in a 100 mile radius."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum! Delish! So dang good! Makes my mouth water to just think about the big bag of yummy goodness in front of me and getting my hands all messy with the most tasty crab legs covered in trifecta perfection! I would eat here everyday if it didn't send me to the restroom with the runs! Buttery, garlic, spicy tasty perfection!  I also have tried the cat fish it was the best I've ever eaten at a restaurant. So delish. Calamari is to die for as well. Oh man I think a visit to the Angry Crab is in order very soon!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good. We had the fish and chips and the pound of shrimp.  The sausage. The spices. I can't wait to come back and have the crab legs. Service was very friendly and quick. They have a big sink outside of the bathrooms where you can wash up afterwards, because you're going to get messy. It's worth it though! Prices are good for what you get."}
{"text":"Omg! Angry Crab Shack is my new spot!!! We went for the first time & I want to go back tomorrow! Lol. I got the king crab, trifecta, mild. Even the mild had a lil kick to it but just the right amount & it was frickin delicious! Hubby got king crab, sweet & tangy, mild. He loved it. We got sausage, corn & potatoes in our boil bags, all delicious! Its fun too because you dont get plates, silverware or wet naps...nice & messy just how I like it!! They do give you a bib tho  Our server Tori was very nice & friendly too. Maybe its just a coincidence but my 16 month old picky eater even ate her whole big ol chicken tender & fries! Oh & we met \"Princess Diana Banana\" (how she introduced herself to our baby girl), as we were leaving. Lol She was from the midwest like us so we chatted a bit, super nice lady! If youre debating trying it.....GO!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. No organization whatsoever. They continued to seat people that came in after us."}
{"text":"Angry Crab is awesome. I met a friend for lunch there and was pleasantly surprised by everything from how clean the restaurant was, how great the service was, and how delicious the seafood was! Not saying I went in with the expectation that it would suck but this place looks like a sketchy dive from the outside and Arizona is landlocked sooooo... I had some reservations. Nevertheless, we each got a pound of shrimp. I had the low country boil (deliciously dill-y) and my friend had the trifecta. We also got sweet potato fries. Everything was awesome! I wasn't even squeamish about the shrimp coming out in full shell! I brought my leftovers home to my grandparents who happen to be the worlds most notorious divas. They loved it too! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Selected this restaurant due to its yelp ratings, and it was excellent. The service was good, and the food was great. Our server, Nicki, was attentive and pleasant. We ordered a few pounds of shrimp with mild spices. It was top notch. The atmosphere was great for us, as we had our kids and grandkids along. They really enjoyed being allowed to color on the tables and walls!"}
{"text":"My review is pretty simple... go to The Angry Crab over Hot and Juicy!!  I went to hot and juicy first and wasn't overly impressed...I thought maybe it had been over hyped and I had too high of expectations. Than I went to the angry crab and now I get it. Their seasonings are waaaaay better and the atmosphere is much more fun and relaxed"}
{"text":"Our first time here and it did not disappoint  the food was delicious and the service was Great. The calamari was really good but if you want to be adventurous try the alligator it was super good. It was a little loud but to be expected in a place like this. Great place to enjoy good food and have a great time."}
{"text":"I was excited to see the progress as this location as it was being built conveniently located 15 minutes from my home. From the very first visit I was hooked! Great food at a reasonable price. I love spicy food and order the level 4 trifecta with sausage, potatoes, corn shrimp and crab legs. My wife and I share this portion and still have enough to take home. They also have a bar that serves a good selection of beer, wine and mixed drinks.  My son is not a shellfish fan but loves their BBQ. I have no problem eating with my fingers and receiving my food in a plastic bag on a table that is covered with a paper table cloth. Crab in a bag seafood boil is fun to eat and so delicious. No plates here, so be prepared to dig in! This is a staple in our regular dining options and I recommend it for fresh, tasty seafood."}
{"text":"Can we just talk about the service for a moment. They make you feel like you're at home enjoying a meal. We had Nate and Tuc. Constantly checking at the right times and making sure all is well. Super friendly! Manager is awesome! They showed my son how to ring the bell they use for birthdays. Food was amazing!! Music is awesome. Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Not very \"first time\" friendly. Let the first server Regina know we were first timers. She seemed rushed and done with her job. Then we got Pat. They both came to the table to let us know Regina was actually done. All seemed fine with Pats service. However some of the waitresses were doing their closing work and Pat had notice a girl (Ashlyn) checking tables that Regina had already done. So he goes to Ashlyn and aggressively and rudely tells her loudly in front of guest that the tables were already done and that it was stupid of her to be doing that.  Soooo uncalled for. You could tell the second you walked in that staff didn't seem happy. In such a fun and laid back environment  it doesn't go unnoticed. Very unfortunate to see that. Still left a tip. But also left a note addressing the dissatisfaction of seeing that."}
{"text":"In a word: delicious!!! First time here and we loved it. My husband had the fried shrimp and was very happy with it. I got the bag of snow crab legs with trifecta sauce at a level 1. It was a good level of spiciness for me, enough to taste and make my lips tingle a bit by the end of my meal, but not so much that it interfered with enjoying my food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really liked the salmon I took.. very well seasoned and spiced! Also tired king crab.. food is awesome.. service was little weak"}
{"text":"I love great seafood and they have GREAT seafood. The restaurant has a very fun vibe. Whenever someone orders a very spicy dish, the waitress will ring the bell to let all the customers know. (HA) All the waitstaff are fun too. There's also a special desert for the birthday person. I've eaten there so many times and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place has the best seafood! So delicious and you get a large amount of food for a very good price! The scenery of the restaurant also has a super cool vibe and the wait wasn't long at all! The service was great and you really can't go anywhere else for seafood after eating here!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! My boyfriend and I went to Angry Crab Shack for our first time on a Friday night. It was PACKED. We debated on waiting around or not.. but decided to since neither of us had been here before. When we finally got called back to our table we were waited on right away by our rockstar server who was handling a ton of tables at the same time without breaking a sweat. She was very informative, friendly, and welcoming! We decided to try a couple of different things. To start we had the frog legs- which weren't to our liking because of all the little bones in them... but the sauce they give with it was AWESOME. We got a side of cajun fries that were delicious and then shared an order of shrimp and crawfish. We loved the shrimp which I ordered it with garlic sauce and a level 2medium spice. It was a fun new experience breaking everything open and eating right out of the bag on the table. I highly recommend this place!! Will be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and super fun. Went in a big group and unfortunately you cannot do reservations otherwise I would have rated a 5 . We waited awhile but that was due to being a Friday night and we had 15 people with us."}
{"text":"So I've hear a lot about Angry Crab Shack in Peoria. My friends know I love seafood so they keep recommending me to try it. Also heard about the long wait so decided to come on a Monday. Lucky the bar area was empty so we were able to get a table. As far as the dining room it was super packed.   First thin I noticed with Angry Carb is the New Orleans feel..like a shack..you can write on the walls if you find space. It's actually really cool and fun looking.   As for the menu what we decided on was seafood in a bag. You order by the pound. We ordered a lb of snow crab, mussels, and added sausage and some potatoes. Those are added for an extra cost. Got the tri-fecta spice with a one bag a 2 and the other a 3 on the heat.   When they serve you the seafood there are no plates, just a white butcher paper to eat on. We pulled the pieces of seafood out and tried our best not to make too much of a mess.   Excellent seafood, and a great spice. But just watch the spice level. I'm not a super spicy fan but do like a little heat on my food. I found the 2 to be very spicy with the 3 down right burning my lips and mouth! My wife love not food and even she was having trouble with the 3. They go up to a 6 which seemed crazy! We watched a couple order the 6 on the side and after a few bites were crying! Order a spice level down from what you usually order and you will be happier!  Our server told us of a Monday special called \"treasure bags\". Only on Mondays they have 2 pounds of mixed seafood for $25. It's a great deal, we came back on a Monday early afternoon and had one. It came with king crab and shrimp and clams and veggies for $25. Was enough to share but they sell out quickly. I ended up calling ahead of time to make sure they had them available.   Overall Angry Crab is worth the hype they have been getting. They have several valley locations. I'll stick with this location because it's close to me but I'm sure any of the locations are good. I'll be back to Angry Crab very soon!"}
{"text":"I go here every month and I absolutely love it!!! Everyone is friendly, and very friendly!!! They got to know me and my family so quick and the servers  that usually takes our order knows ours by heart!! You can draw on the table mat and on the walls and the food is really what ever you feel comfortable with!!! There is so many options and they suggest things to! They treat you like family and it is just a fun place to be. Not to mention how my kids love the tank of the crab/lobster the prices are not to bad and the location is also nice!! We set at a desperate table at the bar and so do our kids we never see anything inappropriate or that I don't want my kids to see, we love this place"}
{"text":"I'm not a big seafood water outside of the basics, lie shrimp crab and car fish... but I had their bag shrimp for the first time and with the house spice mix it was awesome.   That paired with them Cajun fries made the food glorious.  They were a little lacking on the lobster that once they cracked open for me it left about 4 tablespoons of crab meat and then when dessert came out it was a small portion.  But over all I had a great experience ...the bag of shrimp was on point !"}
{"text":"This place is fun and the food is good, prices are high cause its Arizona and you can't catch these types of Crabs locally.  I love to get messy when I truly enjoy what I am eating and this place gives you that for sure. They do have  well positioned sinks so throw on a bib and get crackin!"}
{"text":"We were excited to return for another visit this evening. Unfortunately, the service was no where near how well we were treated a couple weeks ago. The food was good, as to be expected. Our server only checked on us once, and didn't come back until we finished our meal. We had better service during dinner rush on the weekend. When we came in today, the place was dead, so no excuses. Hubby says its time to give these guys a break. :("}
{"text":"As returning customers, I opted for the fresh crawfish, trifecta ghost. Needless to say they knocked it out of the park. Seasoning was spot on, sausage was perfect in flavor and crunchy, not over cooked. Corn was delish dipped in the seasoning. Family had snow crab and had equal results. Will definitely continue to come her for family dinner. Perhaps catfish next time?  If o were to offer any advice, step up on the drink size. 16oz beer just isn't enough ."}
{"text":"Me and my friend enjoyed lunch here for the first time today - both of us have dined at different cajun shrimp restaurants in the past. Together we ordered 1 lb of shrimp in mild trifecta seasoning/sauce, 2 sides of rice, cajun fries, and sweet potato fries.   The most positive aspect of my whole experience was the excellent customer service. The waiters were very attentive and constantly made sure we were enjoying our meal. The sauce was pretty flavorful and had a nice amount of garlic but it contained more oil than I expected. The oily consistency of the sauce makes eating with your hands a very messy job (so dress accordingly and be prepared to use ALOT of napkins). The sweet potato fries and the cajun fries both had very good portions - definitely enough to split between two people. The fries themselves were thick and a bit more soft/chewy rather than thin and crunchy. We initially thought that the 1 lb delivered to our table looked a little small, but it was descent. My only complaint would be the amount of rice we were given as a side, it was definitely less than I had hoped for. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"There aren't that many good seafood restaurants in the desert. I love this one. The seafood is great and the sides are pretty good too. Fun, casual atmosphere and the servers are attentive. We've returned several times since discovering the place and we recommend it to our friends and family."}
{"text":"There are no words for this place. The drinks are delicious, and the food is on another level. I've been to New Orleans several times and this food is as close to home as it can get. Very well priced!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour and I am so pleased I did! While I am not a huge seafood person, they have plenty of items on the menu. Not being very hungry, I opted for a bowl of gumbo and the cajun fries. I absolutely love Cajun/Creole and it brings me back to the 5 weeks I spent in New Orleans a few years back. I've been trying to find a good bowl of gumbo in Phoenix since then, and have found it! it was superb and well done. It also pairs well with a delicious Abita Purple Haze. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you're from Maryland or the Chesapeake Bay area, don't, don't, DON'T order the blue crabs! I had three steamed crabs: one had no claws; one had no legs (including the backfins); two were paper-shells with no meat; the one that had meat was mushy; couldn't taste the Old Bay, although the server assured me it was part of the boil; no mallets or knives. ARGHHH!"}
{"text":"Good Cajun seafood place on par with Boiling Crab, Hot N Juicy etc. It seems like every urban area has their favorite Cajun seafood place. In OC its Boiling Crab, in Vegas its Hot N juicy, and it seems in Phoenix this is the place, Angry Crab. They all pretty much taste the same to me. This place had live crawfish, which have a more springy, bouncy texture that frozen. I try to never eat the frozen ones. Still some of those crawfish were loaded with mud or doo doo, it happens. Still tastes good. King crab was good but a little pricey, as usual. The spicy seasoning is not hot at all."}
{"text":"We got a gift card for Christmas, and decided to check this place out.  So glad we did!  From our server, Adam, to the food, everything was really enjoyable.  Hubby and I aren't really into the bags of seafood, but we do enjoy the baskets.  I went with the fried clams (which I can't seem to get everywhere around here).  It is listed under the starters, but the basket was full of the fat & juicy little buggers.  The breading is crunchy and flavorful, but I definitely was able to taste the clams.  And, along with the cocktail sauce for dipping, they were really good!  I also got a piece of cornbread on the side...I ended up eating it at the end, like a dessert, which totally worked for me.  Hubby got the catfish basket with fries and cole slaw.  We've never seen a bigger piece of catfish before!  There was one HUGE breaded filet, and his fish was flaky and delicious.  It was served with an aioli, which he really liked.  He finished everything in his basket, and got a slice of cheesecake to end his meal.  Let's put it this way, there was nothing left when he was done.  Our server, Adam, was friendly and answered all our questions...even the dumb ones...LOL!  We'll definitely be coming back, there were some items on the menu we'd like to try next time."}
{"text":"Pricy for what you get. Doesn't taste like the seafood really marinate very long and they also come out extremely quick. We paid $179 for 3 people. A little crazy but wanted the full experience. I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"So, we had visited the Goodyear location previously so I was a little hesitant since we weren't impressed by that location. Well, turns out I was wrong! I'm not a seafood person but the people who ordered the buckets LOVED them so much more than the other location. The Trifecta is a great seasoning. My only wish is that they had a few more items for non-seafood eaters. They have a couple but they don't taste the greatest. Service was great, they did forget one item but we didn't end up needing it anyway so they took it off the bill. We will be back to this location soon though!"}
{"text":"Our first time here, what a friendly staff. Our waitress Jonya was so nice and clearly loves her job! It is messy and even with the bib I still managed to get it all over my shirt! Good thing I was dressed down for the occasion.  Flavorful.. Delicious. Better than Joes.. I would definitely go back! I had the trifecta number 1 cause I'm not big on spicy and it was perfect for me I think another notch would've been unpleasant for me, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food. My son got chicken strips and fries... He loved the fries and how crunchy they were and he loved eating my food as well.  My hubby got the same dish as I did but number 2 on the spice and he said it was perfect and he loves heat when it comes to his food. We did order dessert the red velvet cheesecake, it was good but not what I imagined and its not something I would order again or consider a cheesecake. But it was good just nothing I'd personally go for again. Oh and their cajun fries delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Took my husband and daughter here for the first time and we  Loved it!!!! Will defiantly be back! The food was amazing and the atmosphere was defiantly fun!!!!! This place is way better then Joe's crab shack! Give stars"}
{"text":"Who would have thought  you could get excellent seafood in the desert. Had an awesome meal at Peoria location. Very busy place but our waitress Sam was awesome. She explained the menu and was attentive  without being intrusive.  Had the snow crab with the Trifecta sauce and mild seasoning. A return trip is definitely in the planning."}
{"text":"Just too much work and a big mess for what you pay. I'd rather go to Pappadeauxs and have my food ready to eat instead of digging into a big messy baggie for about the same price. Had the trifecta w/ heat #3 even though my wife had the trifecta w / heat #2 the flavors were not even close to the same even though they were both trifecta seasonings. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It was a busy friday night! They told us the wait was about 45mins... well 15 mins later, I got a text saying that our table is ready, awesome! Aaron, our server was nice and accommodating. I ordered my usual shrimp trifecta mild and my friend ordered the soft shell crabs with a side of cajun fries. The fried crabs were huge, it comes with a dipping sauce and a side of coleslaw and lots of cajun fries. My trifecta shrimp was very juicy & it's finger licking good.. with lots of lemon juice! From Mesa, to Phoenix, and now here in Peoria.. My experience is always great!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my parents out to lunch and told them to pick the place, and I'll buy. We came here on a Saturday around 11:30 (wanted to get there before the rush) and I'm SO glad my mom and dad chose this restaurant! Danelle was our server and she was amazing! She helped me order since it was my first time there, and she showed my dad how to clean his dungeon crab. She is a very attentive server and makes you feel right at home!  My mom and I both had snow crab legs and OMG they were amazing! I will be back with my own family soon and will be asking to sit in Danelle's section!"}
{"text":"Truly a nice place to have in a town with not many good food options. Commercial establishments and fast food line every road, and then there's sits angry crab. You're typical crab in a bag broil with an 'angry flare'. Fun atmosphere, lively and attentive service.  Defiantly worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's the sea food lover in me or I just can't get enough of king crab legs from this place! I love the sauce, I try to mimic it when I make my own crab legs at home but it's just not the same. I've even kept the left over sauce, bought crab legs and re-purposed the sauce still not the same. Love the energy this place has, the writing on the wall spells it out (no pun intended), the drinks and the kids enjoy eating with the hands with the bibs on. Must do again immediately!"}
{"text":"Came in for the firdt time tonight,  had snow crab, it was really good. Sat at the bar, Zach was a great bartender."}
{"text":"My wife and I went a few weeks ago.  We ordered the lobster.  The lobster was in a plastic bags served in a pail.   It was terrible and over priced.  I would advise anyone going anywhere but here."}
{"text":"My fiancé was craving a bucket of sea food... but we live in AZ... so I started searching for someplace I could take him for his birthday. I found this place on yelp and we decided to try it out. We got there at about 5:15 on a Thursday and there were already a lot of people inside. We got a high top right away though. We ordered local beers, a shrimp bag with sausage and potatoes, a bag of snow crab, and a Dungeness crab.  We also got bread to soak up all the sauce. (A lot I know... but we were celebrating) The atmosphere was so fun! There is writing all over the walls and tables and the wait staff is loud and having fun. Whenever someone ordered the hottest sauce they set off an alarm as it was brought to the table!  So for the food. The Dungeness crab was fun and different but really expensive. The best part about it was the \"brain juice!\" Our waitress broke it down for us and told us to try it and it was absolutely phenomenal. Tasted like butter and seafood and garlic on the bread we ordered. The shrimp was the best bag we ordered in my opinion but I loved the snow crab as well. We were messy, used our hands to eat, and it was a blast. It is so much more than just great seafood. It is a place to sit and enjoy and take more time to talk and laugh while you break down your seafood. They gave us three options for dessert for his birthday and we went with the cheesecake which they brought to him while singing happy birthday.  It was a little too much grease and butter for my taste which is why I gave it 4 stars. But I had never had seafood like that before and my fiancé said that's how it is supposed to be. Great place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We tried a few different things, catfish, cod, calamari and everything was excellent! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"cajun.... seafood.... tasty..... delicious.... fun.... yummmm... excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Long wait but the food and service were good.  A fun experience!"}
{"text":"This location tastes much better than the one I normally go to in Mesa.  My server was the gentlemen with glasses.  He is super nice and attentive.  Only thing is the two blonde girls hostess are pretty bad at what they supposed to do to greet customers."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday night with my parents and brother. Super friendly waitress who was so helpful and attending. She showed me how to crack open the shells on my crab legs and was upbeat. So thank you Tori!  The Cajun fries were really good! Didn't care for the Gator bites much, but that's easy to look over. The atmosphere here is really fun. If you like seafood and getting a little messy, I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Oh my... where do i start. I love this place. Just a tip if you plan on going Saturday evening be prepare to wait a good hour or so. I usually go on a sunday afternoon. I love their gumbo, fried oysters and cornbread. We usually get a pound of shrimp with the trifecta seasoning to share. And it's pretty cheap for a seafood place. Service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"I see this restaurant in the next episode of Bar Rescue. You order your food which is placed in a plastic freezer Ziploc bag.. It's like buying a fish at Petco. Don't get me wrong the food is good but for a family of four $70 Plus tip is $$$$$."}
{"text":"I came here with friends MM and LS for dinner since they wanted some good seafood. We figured this place would be like Boiling Crab in SoCal, and it is pretty similar. It is located in a plaza so there is plenty of parking. We were seated fairly quickly at a booth near the back. The restaurant is pretty large, and they can seat a decent amount of large parties it seems.  We ordered the following: (SEAFOOD MARKET) SHRIMP, SNOW CRAB, SAUSAGE -- This is their most popular item, where you choose a seafood item and they bring it out marinating in sauce inside a plastic bag. First you choose your seafood. My friends wanted shrimp ($15/lb) and snow crab ($18/lb). Then you choose a sauce. They went with Trifecta, which is kajun, lemon pepper, and garlic. Delicious! You choose a spiciness level--they went with 1-Mild (Wimpy). And if you want you can add additional items to your bag, and they chose to add Sausage (4 pipeces for $2). I did not partake in this because I did not want to get messy (although I guess that's the whole point of this place--they do give you plastic bibs to wear) but my friends enjoyed their seafood. (ANGRY BASKET) GATOR NUGGETS ($15) with Cajun fries and coleslaw -- Looking at the menu now, this was supposed to come with coleslaw! Except it didn't... And I even ordered coleslaw separately! Which ALSO didn't come out. They didn't charge us for the coleslaw, since we never got it, but I'm sad to see that this item was supposed to come with it as well and it didn't. It did come with the fries though, which is good. These are real alligator nuggets and I tried one. Tastes like chicken! ;) (BURGERS/SANDWICHES) SHRIMP PO'BOY ($10) with Cajun fries -- What a disappointing Shrimp Po'Boy. It was just shrimp nuggets with some tomato, lettuce, and pickles inside a very dough-y piece of bread sliced in two. The shrimp po'boy I get in Monterey Park is SO. MUCH. BETTER. I thought since this was a seafood place their shrimp po'boy would be good but I was disappointed. The cajun fries are good though. How can you go wrong with seasoned fries though? (THE FIXIN'S) PCH FRIES ($4) -- We ended up getting another order of cajun fries since we like them so much. They just happen to be named PCH fries because they were running a promotion supporting the local children's hospital. (DRINKS) WHISKEY PEACH ($10) -- This was quite a delicious cocktail with Kentucky bourbon, elderflower, fresh peach, and a candied peach ring. The peach candy was too stale for me to eat but I did really like the drink.  So I really liked my drink and of course I enjoyed the fries, but I was so disappointed with the shrimp po'boy and the lack of coleslaw. But my friends seemed to really enjoy their meal, so I think overall this place merits three stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best place to eat in peoria!! I recommend first time you start with crab or peal and eat shrimp. Pick your flavor and go to town. It's messy and delicious. Fun for families and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fun place to take the family and good food! Be ready to get dirty!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! The bartender Britt gave me first class service. First time and I'm so happy Arizona has a place like this!"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy!! I love this place.  The format is awesome -- your food is served in a bag and the table is covered with paper.  Fun way to eat!  This is one of our favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most amazing food and service ever!!! I eat here like 2-3 times a week from I can! The staff are all amazing  as well as the management! I can't say enough good things about this place and I'm soooo happy they are so close to me!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Love the atmosphere there! Everyone is so kind and friendly! Don't even get me started on how delicious their food is! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"My first experience consisted of shrimp, spiciness, fantastic hush puppies, and a messy face and fingers. Great concept, some of the best shrimp I have had in my life. The sauce is un-freakin'-believable. Can't wait to go back and try another type of seafood."}
{"text":"Love this place! Haven't had anything that we didn't like! Great food prices and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Nice southern style food. We had crab, shrimp and salmon and everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"Too much fun!  Our annual holiday lunch was a messy bunch of fun today.  The Trifecta Sauce is the way to go.  Combo of Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Garlic.  I had clams, a friend had shrimp and snow crab, another just snow crab.  We added the corn and potatoes.  Great sweet potato fries.  I ordered oysters, but they are Pacific, bigger and stronger, not my favorite.  Fried clams were better.  Try a cranberry Moscow Mule- yummy!  I will be back.  Ashley was the WOMAN!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the service is incredulous. The food was amazing, possibly the best low country boy in the USA. Very good service and amazing flavor of sauces!!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood, this is definitely the place for you! If you don't, you should give it another shot by coming here. The food was delicious! We got 3 boil bags and they were all fantastic. The staff was diligent and helpful and on top of that friendly and personable. The seafood is at market prices making it a little pricey, but still very much worth it. We loved it so much we bought a t-shirt (which also gives you a discount Monday through Friday if you wear it in). We will certainly be bringing family and friends here in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Do not go for the ambiance but for the delicious food!! The boil in the bag was perfect and the place is just somewhere to go get good food and hangout! Feels like being at an old friends place!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Hot and tasty as well. Everyone was quite friendly. Price ranges from $9.00 and up depending on what you order. No matter what it's all good."}
{"text":"Excellent sea food. My friends got a pound of shrimp (Mild for me ... but he got a bottle of hot sauce to flavor them to his liking.)  I got the catfish sandwich.  Service was a bit slow (thus only 4 stars) as he had to get up to get what we needed from the waitress.  I plan on returning"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was such a disappointment! My wife and I visit this location often and always have great service and great food. This time however, was apparently an off night. Service was far from superb and the crab legs weren't as fresh as normal. Glad this wasn't our first experience or we would not be returning.  Not quite ready to give up on this location entirely and we will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Good food, though a bit pricey. Nice place for good, casual dinner... but come early because it gets really busy after about 5:30pm daily."}
{"text":"Hey we went here for my wife's birthday !  Food was good, hush puppies rocked!  The family like the onion rings.  We did crab legs, mussels and shrimp.  Oh gumbo is a big winner.  After dinner the manager came over and talked to us.  We had a nice visit.  He also corrected me, we are guest not customers .  We would hit this place again!"}
{"text":"My family usually does big get togethers here for peoples birthday and we love it. It's hard to find good sea food in Arizona and even harder to find a restaurant that can deal with such a big group of people but they do an amazing job!"}
{"text":"Was it good? Yes! Was it worth the price? Debatable. Although great tasting all you get is a boil bag and the seafood, nothing comes with it. For a place that doesn't even use utensils I feel the price is steep. However it's a fun experience to at least try once! Skip the desserts though, they weren't the best but hey they are known for their seafood not pecan pie and cheesecake."}
{"text":"We were in last Friday and there was a decent wait time do we decided to sit at the bar which turned out to be a great decision! The atmosphere was amazing and Chris took great care of us. He was attentive to all customers at the bar and took the time to talk to each of us. Food was delicious as always and Chris made the whole experience better. We will be back soon and will definitely sit in the bar!"}
{"text":"Last night with my boyfriend and had a great time!! Thank you Tori for being a great waitress.  The gumbo was on point and the shrimp was on point and fresh"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place??   Price is steep but once a month is ok lol!!   Got to have my  2lbs king crab hahaha"}
{"text":"I gotta do a HUGE shout out to some amazing people who tonight made a monthly dinner outing for a group of moms fun & a record for most attending. ... Diana (mgr), Daniel (Gm) and Steve (best server) as well as the others who helped THANK YOU!!!! The special treatment was greatly appreciated and the food was FANTASTIC!!!!! I must say, I am an official ANGRY CRAB FAN and highly reccomend this place ."}
{"text":"Definitely a big fan of Angry Crab and may I just set the record straight and say it is way better than Hot N Juicy? That's the truth.  With a very similar concept and aesthetic to that of Boiling Crab and the similar Cajun/Creole seafood places, Angry Crab is definitely the better ones in the Valley. Thank goodness for this location as driving down to CenPho was getting pretty tiring.  Whenever my folks are in town or my friends are craving seafood, this is where I take them!  Dined in with my family and we ordered shrimp, fried gator, fries and hush puppies. Definitely, share the sides are they come in a good portion. I love the freshness of the seafood here, which they're pretty transparent about, whether they are fresh or frozen. The prices reflect that.   I always get the whole trifecta which is a balance of cajun spices, garlic, and butter- of course, medium spicy for that good kick of heat! Always find the shrimp perfectly cooked, big in size and not mushy. Be sure to ask for salt and pepper with limes to dip your seafood in, it really brings out the flavor of the seafood. My favorite side here are definitely the hush puppies, who doesn't love hush puppies? A small amount of heat, deep fried and served with ranch ... yes. The fried gator, you could pass on as they were a bit too tough and yes it does taste just like chicken, just tougher especially when fried.   Prices are decent, you get the most bang for your buck with the shrimp here but they do serve non-seafood choices here which is amazing. Their BBQ ain't that bad, to be quite honest. Service is always spot on! This is also my favorite location, you know, because it's so conveniently close to home :-)"}
{"text":"Have been to only one other seafood restaurant similar to the in Westgate... but the Angry Crab was much better. Crawfish were large and meaty....mussels were green lip and yummy...gumbo excellent..beer cold. Bar is really good...lots of fun cocktails and the menu is much more extensive then the place in Westgate ! Service was also EXCELLENT... Huge difference from Westgate. Loved Nate...war, personable, knowledgable...excellent service. Very good experience..would highly recommend for seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"I brought the guys here for dinner and watch the World Series, the food was great the atmosphere was also very good-BUT the only issue was although our waiter was a great guy (Matt) we did have to constantly chase him down for drink/beer, other the that it was a great night! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was a very fun place. The shrimp in trifecta sauce was very tasty. I must admit I do not getting messy, and this was about the messiest I've been, while eating dinner that I have been in a very long time. So so messy. The shrimp were huge, juicy, sweet, spicy, flavorful. I tried to find something wrong with this place that would prevent me from awarding 5 stars, but honestly I could not. There were a few things that I would have liked to see that would have made this a 6 star experience, I asked them to play the cops America Argentina match on the tv, they said they would, but I guess they got too busy or forgot. They did not know what a Remoulade was, and the hush puppy's were slightly undercooked. Other than that, what a great place! Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Michelle was our server and she was amazing! It was our first time to a restaurant like this and she took her time explaining how it worked. She also made recommendations that we took and very happy we did!! We will most certainly be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Just had to stall in the area so wanted to get something to eat and came across here...shocked it was so good!! Started with gumbo which was fantastic!! Then got the trifecta level 3 hot (plenty for lip burning) for the mussels, crawfish and shrimp!! Shrimp was great!! Mussels very convenient to eat...crawfish was fresh but overlooked as no juices if you like to suck their heads...but flavor still incredible!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at 2 valley Angry Crab Shacks and absolutely love their food. I ate at this Peoria location last Saturday with my in-laws. We brought them to celebrate their anniversary and my mother-in-law's birthday. It was my mother in law's first authentic boil, and though she was a bit worried about going all in without a plate and traditional silverware she ended up loving it.   The food at both locations is always so amazingly delicious, and the prices are really fair for such amazing seafood. I love that there are so many choices; including healthy items. I always get the raw Oysters on a half shell and I'm never disappointed! They go for $8 for half a dozen which to me is an amazing price. I usually love the Mahi Mahi grilled basket, but at this location they did not have it anymore. I ordered the salmon (so good), and replaced my rice with freshly steamed veggies. Let me tell you about the veggies; they were so beautifully steamed and no butter or oil. The assortment of veggies was very impressive as they had a slice of Taro root and what I think was a turnip along with cauliflower, green beans, bell peppers, and carrots. I noticed they had that choice available in their boil bags as well, which is great for vegans or vegetarians.   Our server was honestly one of the best I've had at a restaurant in years. So good my other half made sure to let him and his manager know. He went above and beyond, and was patient with my in-laws. My father-in-law is allergic to pork, and it got brought up when asked if he wanted to add sausage to his boil. It did not even dawn on me to think about it, but the server let us know they cleaned a pot to do his separately since they are cooked with sausage normally. We didn't even ask him to check on it, but he went above and beyond to avoid any cross contamination issues.   My partner and I were very pleased with the experience at this location, and his parents walked away happy. My mother-in-law even called us two days later to thank us again for such an amazing dinner. To please my in-laws means the food was delicious and service was impeccable. That's a big deal! I highly recommend trying out one of the valley locations as soon as you get a chance. If you are near Peoria do not hesitate to stop by for amazing food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great food and Great Fun  I find it funny that the things other people complain about are the exact things that make me love this place.  It's true that you get no plates, the seafood is authentic (heads on), you get a rock as a tool, it's loud, it's spicy, no wet naps, bla bla bla....  That's what makes this place awesome!  It's a fun Cajun house where you go for spicy authentic Cajun food and a good time.  Keep it up Angry Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"I hated sea food. Key word, HATED. Past tense. Angry crab was a great experience. The server made a great recommendation and service was exceptional. The snow crab was buttery and delicious. Cajun fries...top notch. I'm glad I made the leap to try it out the other night and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try the place food was OK but not spectacular left there still hungry and sixty dollars poorer"}
{"text":"No complaints here. Tried the char'd oysters and they were DELISH (I am not a fan of oysters and I didn't mind them). Also had a pound of snow crab, with trifecta mild, added sausage. I loved it, it was good crab, big pieces of meat, great seasoning. We will definitely be coming here as a 'go-to' crab leg joint!"}
{"text":"I have been to Angry Crab multiple times and every time I go the experience gets better and better!   The service we received was attentive and our server was able to answer all of our questions. He was also very attentive to the allergy needs we had at our table.   The food was delicious! Normally it seems as though it's spicier than I want it to be, but the mild definitely fits my taste pallet.   Overall, it was a wonderful family experience!"}
{"text":"We had never been here before.  I saw on Facebook that this would be the last day for the Monday mixed bags.  We decided that the mixed bag would be the best way to experience their different foods.  We arrived around 1:30 pm & was immediately greeted as we entered the door!  The hostess that seated us was very pleasant.  Our server was Nate.  He was so much more than a server.  He was an advisor, an entertainer & gave us so many helpful tips.  He made us feel very comfortable & welcome there.  Remember this was our first time eating food in bags on the table .  We did not want to feel embarrassed by not knowing how to eat the food.  That was definitely not a problem because Nate explained everything so well!  We started with raw oysters.  They were large & served with generous slices of lime and a spicy sauce.  They were great!  Next we were served the Mixed Bags.  Wow had lobster, large shrimp & crab legs & the most amazing tasting vegetables!!  We thought the bags were reasonably priced for such wonderful tasting food.  We actually had over half the food left to take home. Nate told us the best way to reheat the bags of leftover food.  Looking forward to our next visit there & hope to have Nate help us again."}
{"text":"Eat here!  As a transplant from NJ finding comparable places to my staples at home can be difficult.  With Angry Crab being one of few seafood haunts who do what they do finding them...was easy. Frequent customer of The Boil NYC (for catfish and large sweet snow crablegs), Claw Daddy's NYC (grilled oysters) and Just BeClaws Jersey City for the best \"house sauce\"...Angry Crab is one stop shopping  (eating) for all the best if the best. The roasted oysters at Angry Crab are amazing, perfectly cooked and smoky they come on top of grilled bread which I didn't eat there but gladly brought home to nosh on with something else. The catfish while it was a huge piece that appeared to be a lil well done for my taste was surprisingly cooked to perfection.  Hot and flaky, seasonings not over bearing and a crunchy coat.  The remoulade that accompanied it...also great. I only went 4 stars because the crab legs were fine.  Nothing to blow me away but maybe it's because everything else was stoopid-good and....im over crab legs.  Be prepared to get the best kind of messy here!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had a great time. Great food. Messy and fun. We ordered the snow crab with potatoes and corn. Trifecta seasoning with number 2 heat. It was WOW spicy but wow tasty.  I think next time we'll go with no heat. Our server Shack was awesome and really made it an experience worth remembering.  We will be back."}
{"text":"So.... Great food, we had the crab and some sides.  But... There is absolutely No utensils, or plates, you crack the crab with a rock, a river rock to be exact and your entire meal is served and eaten in a plastic bag. When scissors came available we got a pair - the waiter wrote it on the paper covering the table, customers have sticky fingers. Literally & figuratively.  After smacking the crab with the rock I broke down and put the bib on to save my shirt from splattered crab and juices.  Hum - Pros vs Cons are a bit different here...would we go back...if you like a loud atmosphere with ringing bells and yelling employees that have good food and don't mind the lack of tableware go for it. I'll keep it as an interesting dining experience that I have fond(ish) memories of."}
{"text":"First timer to the Angry Crab. Our waiter Zach did a great job providing suggestions on menu items that matched our taste. Started off with the signature Bloody Mary that had a little \"kick\" and a ton of accompaniments (crab leg, olive, asparagus, celery, okra, lemon and lime) with a spicy salted rim - GREAT start!!! My wife and I both could not resist the King Crab legs with the trifecta sauce and mild spice, along with corn on the cob. The crab was sweet and the sauce FANTASTIC!! (only regret was not getting a \"to go\" container for the remaining sauce).  Initially, my wife elected not to wear the bib provided. However, after tearing into the bag of deliciousness and taking the first bite, she realized the bib was a necessity and part of the fun. After all, there are not many restaurants where your fingers are the best form of \"silverware\".  Overall, had a great experience, already recommended to several friends, and WE WILL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"I like this concept. We ate at the bar. The wait for a table was 2 hours! Love the trifecta sauce. The oysters were blue point and amazing. Be prepared to get messy! You eat with your hands! Great food. Alex and Lowe are amazing. Great bartenders and Lowe gave us a crash course on how to crack crabs and lobsters."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my family about a week ago and it was amazing. I grew up eating Louisiana food and let me tell you this is the closest thing to the South you'll taste in AZ! The staff was especially great, shoutout to Nate our waiter! We will definitely be coming back for some for Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"Good fun, super fun place for groups. They warned us their \"spicy\" was pretty spicy so to \"order down\" from your regular preference but we are from the Gulf Coast and mild/medium weren't near spicy enough for us - will definitely pile on some more spice at a future visit. Spring for the King Crab....oh so tasty!!  Don't bother with the po-boy just order the seafood boiled by the bag."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last! Best king crab! Our server Mason was awesome. Loved the atmosphere. Very kid friendly, as we brought our 4yr old son with us."}
{"text":"My folks and their friends had been there several times and enjoyed it and now I was up to going there as well, Great atmosphere and staff. The food was awesome and the way they have it set up at the table makes it a lot of fun to eat there..................."}
{"text":"So, the food is pronominal! My husband and waited forever for this new location to open. our server Danelle was fun and knowledge able. We didn't wait long for our food and she was there to check in with us. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Really good and very well seasoned! Well flavored foods and have a wonderful ambiance. It's more of an ideal place for family and friends, and the prices are charged by the pound, so be mindful when ordering. Would definitely be back to enjoy the food"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. It was kind of a crazy and loud atmosphere, but I guess that's part of the appeal. I had some delicious grilled oysters and the soft shell crab po' boy. It was pretty good stuff. The trifecta sauce was an excellent touch to the grilled oysters.   Our server was Sam. She did a great job handling a large party of all ages."}
{"text":"I'm letting all of you know that Angry Crab- Peoria, is now open!  They don't do barbecue or pizza like some of their sister restaurants in PHX, Mesa and the Tukee- here it's all about crab, shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, mussels, clams, oysters, po boys, catfish and several other things that swim.   Pro tip: dress down because you will get messy. Need to take a shower soon after dining messy. Might wanna drive through a car wash with the windows down messy. But it will be worth it. The staff is very friendly and if you need help tying up your bib, they'll hook you up.  It's across from Lee Lee, on Cactus, just west of 75th Ave and at least for now, only open for dinner from 4-10, 11pm on Fri & Sat. The atmosphere and vibe is so unlike anything else in the area, and of course, so is the menu.   I've been waiting on the \"OPEN\" sign in the front window to be turned on for about 4 months. It's a long overdue \"interesting\" addition to the neighborhood and I'm glad it's finally open!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Food is delicious. -I'm Asian and they actually sell rice here.  -Food is spicy (how I like it) -They sell blue crab -Most of the servers are friendly & smile.  -They have several locations.   Cons:  -It's seafood. Therefore, it's pricey depending on what you order.  -It's hella loud in here. Servers will shout from the bottom of their lungs when there's a b-day or whatever occasion going on.  -Unfortunately, they charge for melted butter. It doesn't come already in the sauce (compared to Hawaii & San Diego's Cajun-seafood restaurants). -They don't provide gloves unless you ask for it.  -They don't always have blue crab/it runs out fast.  -There are normally big parties so expect it to be crowded & children running around."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I loathe sweet potatoes. Absolutely hate them. However, my wife had me try some of her sweet potato fries and I hate to admit but I loved them. They were nicely cooked and had just a touch of Cajun flavor to them.   Their heat runs a little higher than most but they have a wide variety on the scale to choose from so you can customize to your liking.   Prices are very reasonable and worth every penny.  I did the trifecta (highly recommend) with a medium heat on my snowcrab. Loved it so much I was dipping everything into the sauce.  My wife did the Pacific sauce and that was really good as well. She has asked me to try to copy it at home.  My daughter did the fried shrimp basket and while the breading was a little salty, with their cocktail sauce you couldn't even tell and it was delicious. Very good for a children's meal.  With all that said, Joe's Crab Shack can go to hell and die. Angry Crab is the king."}
{"text":"We stopped by this location for dinner after a long drive from Sacramento, CA. Everything is sold by the pounds but it was worth it! We ate $130 worth of food just between the two of us and we didn't have any left over to bring home Lol   We ordered 2lbs of snow crab, 1lb of shrimps, 1lbs of mussels, baked oysters, and drinks. We got hot for our spice level but it was mild for Asian eaters lol   We would love to return again when we are in the area! The food was delicious and the service was great! Sam was our server but sadly her shift ended before we got our food."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time yesterday & Ill be back!  I recently went to a competitor, & I have to say the Trifecta sauce here is definitely better flavor! I had the 1lb snow crab, Trifecta sauce, mild (because I heard spicy is SPICY!!!) & 2 potatoes. Like they say, \"its backyard style\" eating so your food is brought out to you in a bag & you remove the shells. Definitely messy (which they offer a bib & gloves) but worth the mess.  Our servers were Ashlen & Cam (Cam mostly) & he was super friendly & thorough. I guess he was training, but did a good job. The food did take a pretty long time to come out as opposed to when my friend was there previously, but I overlooked that because they were pretty busy & our service was good otherwise.  Cam explained the whole process to me, & offered sauces on the side, etc.. I know my way around cracking crab legs, but I did hear that they will come & show you how if need be.  The place is family friendly & seems like they like to keep a fun environment because they will yell out if its your birthday/if you order extra spicy & get the whole restaurant involved. If you're looking for a fun time & good food I recommend Angry Crab."}
{"text":"Tried out this place because it was recommended that it was the best crawfish place in Arizona. I called them and asked if their crawfish was fresh and live. The girl that answered the phone (Catherine) or something like that said they do have live crawfish. I placed a total order of 7lbs of crawfish and 1 lbs of shrimp with alot of corn and sausages. The crawfish was not fresh at all. Frozen crawfish and it was super dried. It has no flavor and no sauce in the bag. Would never come back to eat crawfish in Arizona again. The shrimp was okay. We didn't finish the food just tossed it away."}
{"text":"Interesting ambiance, personally I prefer Hot n Juicy Crawfish...they won't let you steal the crab openers here lol"}
{"text":"Great place! I'm happy I have one near where I live! Service, ehhh. The place gets busy pretty fast once they open, so hurry up!"}
{"text":"So we stopped here because I'm from Louisiana and wanted a small taste from home. Well if your name is angry crab you would think you would have the blue crab available NO well lets try the crawfish NO not available sold out on a Tuesday around 5:30pm crazy. So I tried the shrimp, potatoes, and corn.. they came in a boil bag and I was excited to open it up it was very hot.. but sadly the shrimp was over boiled. I couldn't peal it and  meat was tuff and white mushy slim under shrimp head..  sucks for me.. but on positive note they finally got some crawfish in the restaurant while I was eating my shrimp. So I ordered some and it arrived 10 minutes later and I was excited to open the bag and see those lovely redhot crawfish.. yum yum.. started to pull the heads off and pinched the tail to get the meat, but it didn't release like normal. They where under cooked. Still rubbery and chewy but had flavor. How could a place that prides itself on boil cooking not know how to boil their food items. Reading all the reviews I must have chosen a bad night to come eat here. Great concept! Just need a cook that knows how to boil seafood.."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner!!!  The shrimp and crab boils were delicious and the gumbo - to die for!!  Thanks Mason for making it a great evening.  We had a fun birthday celebration!!  26 shrimp to be exact"}
{"text":"What an AWESOME experience! First time visitors and excited to come back! Pat, our server, explained everything so we knew exactly what to order and it was delish!  Even the manager. \"Chicago\" stopped by to introduce herself - Wow! Great food, great atmosphere, fabulous service, family fun!"}
{"text":"We absolutely Love this place! The staff is great, and it's a very casual laid back restaurant. So, for me, It's a Pound of Shrimp, Trifecta #2. This gives you incredible flavor with just the perfect amount of kick to it. Ohh, and I usually add Sausage and 2 red potatoes to my bag as well. There aren't any utensils here, you eat out of a bag and on the table, so it's not the place to bring your white shite wearing Church family on Sunday afternoon (At least have them change first). Anyway, this laid back style of dining is fun for all ages, and the food will definitely have you coming back for repeat visits."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was a great experience!!! The no frills was exactly what made me feel like this was legit.  Who else gives you a rock to eat your food with!? I got the snow crab bag with well the fixin's and my boyfriend got a shrimp and oyster po boy and that was good too. I also got oysters on the half shell,  they were good but I've had better locally.  All in all it was a great experience and this will be my go to spot for crab."}
{"text":"Had dinner before Concert, was seated very quickly and server was very good.  The food was hot and fresh, just as expected. Place is a hair load, to the point it was stop a conversation but we were about to start right back up."}
{"text":"So my wife and 15 mo old daughter went for the first time 11/22. I wasn't really sure how much I was going to like it. But gave it a shot anyways. This place blew us away. We had snow crab legs. shrimp and mussels. All were fantastic. Steve our server was very helpful. Also, if they say it's going to be hot and messy, trust them.  I think we met the owner as well. I just had a mouthful of food everytime she came around. Genuinely nice people. Would very much recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place! Excellent quality seafood at an affordable price. Raw oysters were fantastic. Shrimp boil bag was great but not spicy enough for me -  will definitely try level 3 next time. Cajun fries and hush puppies were delicious as well. Fast, friendly and efficient service. We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time today after receiving several recommendations, and we absolutely loved it.  The place was busy for a Sunday afternoon and even had a huge party of 20 seated next to us, but it didn't bother us because the atmosphere was great.  Alexis was our server and she was prompt, personable, and super knowledgeable.  She took awesome care of us.  You could tell just by looking around that every server, as well as the manager, was friendly and genuinely enjoyed being there.  And the food was just as spot on as the service.  We each had a pound of snow crab legs; mine with lemon pepper and my husband, the trifecta.  We also got corn and 3 potatoes each.  It was plenty of food.  It came out fast, fresh, and seasoned perfectly.  We couldn't have enjoyed it more and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and so affordable especially for families. What really made it special was the incredible service from Rjeana and the other staff. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We usually go to the location in Goodyear and their service and food is great. We came to the Peoria location expecting the same great food and customer service and it was a huge mistake. The food came out cold (Luke warm) not hot like it is in Goodyear. We asked to speak to the manager and Jason I think is his name (guy with red beard). The servers were more courteous than him. He didn't care about our service. I told him I just wanted to tell him so hopefully it doesn't happen to other customers. He said ok thanks and walked away. We will never come to this location ever again. Handed the bill to waitress and she asked if I wanted any change. There was a credit card not cash... This place won't last long with the management they have."}
{"text":"Our first time here at this location and we absolutely loved it! Our server, Karlee, gave us a wonderful experience. The food was cooked so perfectly. We love Angry Crab, but almost gave up on it after our bad experience at the Phoenix location. We are so happy that we gave Peoria a chance! Also wanted to mention the pretty girl with two buns in her hair was very nice and welcoming (didn't catch her name).   Side note, the Amazing Karlee mention her Taco/Fish Tuesday idea and we thought it was really cool and we'd love to see that happen! We'd definitely enjoy some tacos!  Also would be so great if you guys had like a membership thing going on, being that we go every week haha."}
{"text":"The kids & I thought we would check it out. We got right in at 4:30. Place is already busy. All the tables full by the time we left at 5:30. Had the shrimp, mussels and snow crab. Going with level 0 next time. Amy was great at making sure we had all our food and keeping the drinks filled. We would like to come back."}
{"text":"Recently celebrated my birthday here and it was so awesome we went back for my husband and mother-in-law's birthday too!   Food is delicious, experience is super FUN and the service was amazing,  our server was Dominic and he is the BEST :)"}
{"text":"I live right by this place and have not been until tonight. It was fantastic and I know I will become a frequent visitor. The manager, Torey, came and helped us at least 3 times specifically asking what we wanted to watch on TV. Our server, Sara, was awesome with her fast service. We saw and spoke with at least 7 different employees during our dining; everyone seemed to want to help everyone else. Different employees brought out our food and numerous employees came to check on how we were doing.   Besides the great service, the food is legit!!! Best sweet potato fries and calamari I have had. It is such a fun atmosphere with true seafood...using tools to cut the crab legs, using the table covering as a plate, and eating with your hands. I will be going back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best seafood/Cajun restaurant I've been to in the valley. As many others have posted, you don't get much in the way of utensils but that's part of the fun. We order a bag of 2 pounds of snow crab with Cajun seasoning and level 1 spicy (we we're too scared to go higher....though in hindsight the \"1\" really is ultra mild and we'd do 2 or 3 spice level next time) The crab was wonderful and we used the sauce/seasoning in the bag for dipping.  Though the food was really great, what set this place apart from other restaurants was the atmosphere and the employees. The waitress Tori was happy to explain the menu to us (being virgins to the restaurant and all), and was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Aside from our waitress, ALL of the staff seemed happy to be there!!! This is so rare and noticed. My biggest \"like\" about this visit would be the employees who seemed happy to serve and be at work."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch and still a bit hungry. Got 6 shrimp and sweet potato fries both were tasteless.  Companion got crab with a rock and scissors to crack and break shell.  Asked for a fork to dig it out and waitress came back with a plastic fork....WHAT!!  The little plastic cup with \"butter\" in it didn't look right asked if it was real butter; was told she wasn't sure maybe half and half....REALLY!!  From the time we entered until we left our shoes stuck to their sticky floor. We eat out regularly and will NEVER see the inside of this place again!!!"}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews on this place and decided to check it out for myself. Upon entering in we were immediately seated. Our server was very helpful as to how to order. I ordered a bag with lobster and shrimp with sausage, corn and potatoes. The Cajun spices in the bag were not overwhelming but enough make you feel you were in the bayou. The cornbread appetizer was more like dessert and its sweetness contrasted with the saltiness of the seasoned shellfish dishes. My wife ordered fried entree platter and we were a little confused because they brought everything out progressively. She would soon finish one item and the next item was coming out. I was given a stone to open my crab legs but fortunately didn't have to use it. The idea of banging my food open with a rock felt more like being on camping trip. My overall experience here was great. If you eat here please wear casual clothes."}
{"text":"First time here. Quick friendly service & the food was really yummy. Kudos to Ashley! We had shrimp, snowcrab & all the fixings (potato, corn, rice, fries) I was looking forward to dungeness crab, but they were sold out the night we went. Will be back to try it next time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love crab and all that but choose not to eat it because I have a long beard and well it gets a little messy. So instead I'm going to tell you what is on their menu other than crab that I will order every time I go, and that would be the fried catfish! Not only is it awesome, it is a very large plate of food! So, if you're going to eat the crab, definitely be prepared to get messy! If not, I suggest ordering the catfish!"}
{"text":"I really dug this place with it's no silverware or plates down-home atmosphere.  The food, also, was amazing! The waitstaff is attentive but not overbearing and they are friendly and willing to walk you through if it's your first time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. I loved the food!  Lunch with friends!  Priceless. Loved watching the live tanks. Didn't have that fishy smell throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid menu if you are looking for seafood by the pound this is your place.  I quickly realized just how hosed you are getting at a \"red lobster\" type place.  I ordered a pound of crab for my wife and it was almost too much.  I had the alligator bites... they were pretty good.  Had I tried to order this much @ another place the price would have been significantly more.  I went midday and had no trouble getting right into a seat.  I have heard that there can be quite the wait on weekends and evenings.  This would not surprise me as the food is pretty solid."}
{"text":"We had another great dinner tonight and what made it even better was the great service that Mason provided to us tonight. The food was delicious once again and the services is always above and beyond especially with Mason taking care of you."}
{"text":"Matthew our server was great! Was knowledgeable on the menu and made the experience awesome to go along with the environment."}
{"text":"30 days later and I still feel like I'm waiting for my corn on the cob that I ordered.."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on the 4th of July and it was okay but nothing that we are going to go to again.  The fried catfish was much better than the fried cod (which was tasteless).  The French fries were greasy but had good spicing."}
{"text":"This place (we went to the Peoria AZ location) - while messy, was fun, food was terrific and the service was fast and great.  The king crab legs we had were sweet and they gave a generous portion for the money four adults consumed 5 lbs of legs and we were stuffed.  LOVED me some lemon pepper butter sauce with medium spice (similar to hot Chinese chili garlic oil).  WOW.    Do.Not.Wear.Clothes.That.You.Don't.Want.To.Get.Dirty.  They will give you a plastic bib but given the size of the bibs vs. the breadth of some of the people there (including me, so don't judge), you might want to plan for spillage.  I didn't get anything on me but was careful.    There are no utensils other than a few plastic ones for cole slaw and a couple of other sides but this was ok.  They do give you a scissors to share to cut the crab /legs, which are essentially dumped out on your table from a bucket (if you don't have a sauce); if you have a nut cracker at home and a strong fork, you might want to bring those in a plastic bag and wrap in a bunch of soapy paper towels so you can wipe them off easily after dinner.  Their scissors don't work all that well after cutting through multiple tonnage of crab every night...but not a criticism - my hands were slippery, too, so hard to get leverage on the handles.  There is a large trough sink in the back of the dining room, paper towels and soap to wash your hands off after dinner, but the only real criticism I had of the place was that the soap wasn't very good at cutting the grease of the sauces.    We had a great time, and we will be back soon.  The place was packed and doesn't take reservations.  It helps to call ahead and find out what the wait time is before you go.  There wasn't much of a wait at all so we chanced it and happened to arrive in between the onslaught of dining waves, e.g., early diners and the \"cool\" arrivers.  That's fine.  We weren't interested in looking cool.  Just full and happy.  And we were."}
{"text":"Ok so I finally was able to make it the Angry Crab Shack, we must have shown up in between rush hour, I say this because several times we went and the place was so packed you would think they were having a sale ! but anyway were were greated and sat down fairly quickly. The server came and explained in detail how they work and items on the menu. I ended up ordering the whole lobster as the wife ordered shrimp, The food was very good, how it is served was interesting, been a long time sense I ate without utensils and right off the table. I got to use a stone to hit the lobster, I felt like a kid again LOL Super messy to eat there so wear clothes that can get messy with you hahaha Enjoy"}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest; Seafood is not my thing but I take my better half here when she wants to go because she says it's the best seafood in the west valley. I had to write a review because our experience here this evening was impressive. One of the kids items was taking a little longer than everyone else's food, it wasn't a big deal and it had only been a few moments after the rest of the food came when we were visited by a manager of some capacity named Jason. He offered a genuine apology and gave us the young lady's sandwich on the house since it had taken so long. We did not bring this to anyone's attention, they took care of this very professionally without being asked and I was really impressed. I own a business myself and its guys like that who make owners and customer's lives easier!"}
{"text":"\"The only kind of seafood I trust is the fish stick.  A totally featureless fish that doesn't have eyeballs or fins.\" ? Dave Barry  We came here for Super Bowl Sunday and what a night! I was a bit disappointed that they ran out of crawfish but it happens. This location is definitely more spacious than their Mesa location and the staff is just as friendly.  So how was the food? The oysters were delicious, the sweet potato fries came out screaming hot (I screamed profanities while burning myself on the first bite), the clams were meaty, and the shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly. The sauce seems more oily at this location than in Mesa which I wasn't a fan of.   I had a great night and the eats were good. I'm not sure I'll ever come back to this location but we had fun on Super Bowl Sunday!"}
{"text":"So good. We had the gator bites and then moved to snow crab and sausage. Wow. Our waiter was Zach.  Ask for him. So fun and awesome service.  Highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"I'm all about efficiency. I remember one time my brother was really mad, my mom gave him a sledgehammer and was like \"Go tear down the shed!\" Efficient. I like it. Feel like smashing something? Don't smash your TV, the wall, a door, your ex's car, and definitely don't smash a living thing - come to Angry Crab and smash a dead lobster with a rock!  First off, you will be angry - lobster is super expensive! (market price) And if the thickest part of the lobster tail is still a little raw & translucent like ours was, you'll be even madder! It's not like they put TLC into their seafood - all ingredients (seafood, seasoning, sauce, potatoes, corn) get steamed together in a plastic bag, just like all the famous chefs do! Efficient? Yes. Then they plop the bag on your table with some kitchen shears and a rock and everyone looks over for a free show - \"Look at this idiot try to go back in time 5000 years and use a rock as his main eating utensil\"  Then rage overtakes you and you're like \"Why (SMASH) didn't (SMASH) I (SMASH) just (SMASH) order (SMASH) the (SMASH) shrimp!\" Bits of lobster shell and goo flying around like Frankenstein's lab. But nobody judges you, it's completely acceptable to go all Dexter on that lobster!  I could have sent the lobster back, gotten something comped, but we had eaten a lot of it already, and I just didn't want to go through the hassle. Efficient. If cooking expensive seafood is your thing, maybe get it right the first time!  Shout out to the much less expensive shrimp, tho. We ordered the shrimp as well, with potatoes and corn, drippy seasonings throughout, and instantly wished we had ordered solely shrimp, or shrimp plus any other non-lobster edible crustacean - crab, clams, mussels, etc. The shrimp saved the night, along with the excellent Grapefruit Moon Juice IPA and some mozzarella sticks. And this happened to be the night KD buried the Cavs with the comeback and dagger 3 in Game 3 of the NBA Finals (very efficient!), which I watched on one of the plentiful TVs inside the Angry Crab while I ate the non-gross parts of the lobster.   ReCap: Beers, Shrimp, Potatoes, Corn, mozzarella sticks, TVs - good. Lobster, not quite cooked, expensive - bad. I would totally go back and avoid ordering the lobster, watch a game, have a good time. Don't be angry, Angry Crab. I'll still recommend you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great seafood and great service.  Hannah, our server, was awesome.  We'll definitely be coming here often. Thanks Hannah."}
{"text":"Me and my wife really enjoyed our experience last night. It was our first time visiting and we were sceptical based off of some friends saying it was just O.k.  Our experience was the best we have had in a long time. Bert our server walked us through the menu even though he looked busy and took the time to make sure we ordered something great. The mussels with Pacific rim sauce were so good. I would go back just for that dish. It was amazing.  We also had the gumbo as a starter which was awsome. Service and food were on point. Loved it."}
{"text":"First time at this location and they had a special going on for 2 lbs bag with a mixture of shrimp, snow crab legs, mussels, and veggies for only $20!  They said they only have it on Mondays, so if you like all that I would recommend trying that. It was a pretty good deal, I changed the flavor spices because I was sharing with someone and he didn't want it too spicy. The service was great! Our server was Lowen and he always checked up on us and made sure we we're good. There were other friendly staff members too but we didn't catch their names. Our food came out in a timely matter and everything tasted pretty good. It wasn't as good as the Indian School location but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite crab shack! The kids love getting messy and hubby doesn't have to share!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the good. I am huge seafood lover. The flavors are great here. You have different choices in flavors and in heat. The idea here is to order a lb of a meat (shrimp, mussels, crayfish, lobster, etc.) You then choose a seasoning followed by heat. Then you have options to put in the bag like corn, sausage, or veggies. The boiler bag comes with everything in the bag. You throw on a bib and get messy. They have gloves upon request. Been here twice this year and plan to return. I would say the only bad is the noise. I will also add that this is by design and just too loud for me. The people in the place love it. You can feel the love in the atmosphere.They yell for birthdays and max heat ordered. They have a siren they sound for birthdays and high heat. If you have sensitive hearing this is not for you. If you like loud fun talkative places, here you go."}
{"text":"Was invited here for lunch and figured it would be another, Joe's Crab Shack...but I was wrong. The ambience of the restaurant was a lot more inviting, clean and friendly.  I ordered the deep fried cod and some wings and they were both excellent.  When everybody in our partied ordered, the waitress told us that a lot of things were sold out.  This really was not that big of deal, but would have been nice to have known before we sat down and were ready to order.  Overall, it was a positive experience and will eventually go back again.  Not in any hurry, but if you're looking for good Cajun seafood, check the place out.  Just make sure you call beforehand and make sure they have menu items in stock!"}
{"text":"Service started OK but after 10 minutes  in and sat down for dinner.  They seem  to  have forgotten  about  us. Our  order was taken  but  forgot  again. So not coming  back! !!!"}
{"text":"We heard a lot of great things about this restraint for crab boils. Although it was delicious I was bummed that we had to clean our own shrimp. It really made it unappetizing and more trouble than it was worth."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and even though I was meeting clients for dinner there (their choice), I put in an order for my daughter and they cooked it right before we were ready to leave (very nice!).  I'm not so much of a fan of the grabby seating.  People walked in behind me and grabbed tables in front of me even though I was clearly waiting first.  But, oh well, that's how they do things.  I'm also not a fan of lining up for my food order.  I prefer to sit and be served.  But, I really enjoyed the food and the outside weather was perfect so I didn't care that much about the people who were so grabby about the tables inside.  But, if you really want a table inside, you need to have the most aggressive person in your party watch for a table and run over and snatch it while someone else in your group gets the food.  This is just how it works at the Angry Crab.  It was my first time there so I didn't realize that I needed to run over to a table as soon as anyone with a table looked they might almost be finished or packing up to leave.  So, food gave me a good taste in my mouth, but not the behavior of the other patrons.  Don't expect chivalry or courtesy from other patrons.  But, heck, they wouldn't be that crowded if the food wasn't that good."}
{"text":"We recently visited the Angry Crab in Peoria and really enjoyed the seafood.  We got a combination of crab, shrimp, clams and vegetables - delicious!  I'm gad we asked for sides of the sauces because we weren't fond of them - basic seasoning was ok.  Very casual environment and they offer you a bib and lots of napkins because you eat with your hands.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Ok. I have been dying to try this place and honestly I wasn't really impressed. Our evening started off right when entering the place has good energy and smells like a east coast seafood shack and no wait on a Friday at about 6:00.   We opted for the calamari to start our meal. It was very good. Not like the normal calamari. Panko fried strips with an excellent horseradish infused cocktail sauce.  Entrees quickly followed. 1 pound of king crab, lemon pepper, mild style. 1 pound of shrimp, I asked if they had Old Bay and our waiter said yes, so old bay, medium spice level it was.   The king crab was good but the sauce tasted just like the \"butter\" they put on popcorn at the theatre. The large shrimp were very spicy and not like any Old Bay I have had, Old Bay usually has the tell tale sign of celery seed, not this it was like Cajun seasoning. If it's not Old Bay, don't call it Old Bay. The shrimp came with the heads on which is ok but my problem was they are not deveined and they give you no utensils to remove them. I do not eat the gritty vein, sorry. My husband's crab came with a rock and a pair of what looked like manicure scissors. Really? A rock? Everything but the calamari was very messy and they only provide small napkins made out of recycled paper. They do not even give wetnaps at the end of the meal.  Overall the food was just, meh. Nothing to write home about and our service was lackluster. We were finished with our meal a good 15 minutes before our waiter even came back to our table.  For a Coke, 1 hard cider, the appetizer and 2 pounds of seafood our bill was $73. For the price I was expecting a lot more. I might return for happy hour because the calamari was very good but will probably not return for the entrees. There are other places in town that will give me sides and remove the poop shoot from my shrimp for a lot less money."}
{"text":"Second try. First time there was about 50 people waiting so we did not stip. This time we went early and there was an almost full parking lot but there were open tables and we were seated as we entered. Layout is a large open room with tables covered with what I would call butcher paper which it is probably not. Paper is changed with every guest as it can get messy. I have eaten at several places that do the tables in this manner and they were all fish/seafood places.  This being our first time ordering was.........well how do I do this?  My wife got a fish basket and the fish and french fries looked good. The fish was not greasy which is a big plus. At so many places that serve fried fish it will be oily but not here. Me being on a high protein diet ordering was a little harder. I ordered the shrimp in lemon pepper sauce and a 3 hot which was supposed to be pretty hot. I am not a shrimp lover but I did not want a pound of clams or muscles. A little of each would of been great. The shrimp was very good. I did get sausage also. This would be a great place to take about 5 or 6 people and everyone get something different and share. Now if I could just find some friends to do this with going to be hard as none or our friends are into fish. About the shrimp was large, heads on and had to be shelled. Oh, the shrimp comes in a plastic bag and a bucket to put your scraps. The 3 is hotness was just a little spicy. No where near hot.  Since this is a large room with wood walls, tile floor it is quite noisy. Hard to talk to the people when ordering and the people you are sitting with. Not sure why but this seems to be the norm in a lot of places.  All in all everyone was helpful and courteous. I will be back especially since it is less than a mile from my house. We may try to do a lunch next time."}
{"text":"If you're hungry this is the place for you! Buckets of food literally brought to your table, no plates just wax paper mats or utensils to eat from but that's just half the fun! Made to order food and local beer on tap. If you plan on not getting dirty during dinner then stay home because this place is for the hungry."}
{"text":"Great place and I'll be back. OK, on that note.... I went there with several friends on a Tuesday (important notation, you'll see why later). There were 12 of us so they gave us the back room so we would be trapped with each other, oh, I mean, have time to socialize with each other. I was impressed that Jason, the manager took the time to stop by when we got there and welcomed us. Although maybe he only did that because the back room was on the way to his office? He was very friendly and helpful explaining how things worked there as only 2 of our group had been there before. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive AND patient with some in our group who \"like\" a lot of attention from wait staff (more commonly known as \"Pain In The A$$es\"). I ordered the Monday Special, Mixed Bag (2 lbs bag with a mixture of shrimp, snow crab legs, mussels, and veggies for only $20). Another thanks to Jason who said they had a couple of bags left over from the day before (now you know why \"Tuesday\" was important earlier). It was awesome. Cooked in a plastic bag to perfection. They let you rip the bag open on the table (paper tablecloth) and eat from the bag with your hands. Personally I would have preferred to have been offered a plate and, at least, a fork (I did finally ask for a fork, and got a cheap plastic one). The sauce was leaking out of the bag and I had to build a napkin dam to stop it from dripping onto my lap. Also, a good thing I didn't succumb to peer pressure and not wear my bib, as my shirt would have been a mess. It was worth the teasing to stay clean. Luckily for me no one got a picture of me in the bib to post on Facebook. Anyway, I was pleased with the food and will be back.   OK, so why only 4 of 5 stars if it was so good you ask.... Next time, at least offer me a plate or bowl (preferably) to transfer my food to so it doesn't leak all over the place. Have some decent silverware on hand for those of us who don't always want to eat with our hands. And, lastly, when you advertise a Happy Hour, have a Happy Hour! I understand that they are new and are now only open for dinner (at 4:00pm) and Happy Hour is advertised as 3-6, but would it hurt to offer the Happy Hour prices from 4-6 until you open for lunch? Just a though, but hey, I'm not in the restaurant management business."}
