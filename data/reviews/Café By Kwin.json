{"text":"New cafe that I recently discovered while taking the bus to Downsview Station. I decided to check it out since one of my favourite go-to cafes closed down.  The menu is clear, and at a fair price. Some things are expensive but it's understandable. I've been trying to get something different each visit, and everything I've had tasted great so far. My favourite is the grilled cheese+ham (which comes with soup for $1). It has free wifi, a sofa, television, nice space, and is a cute cafe overall.  My only con is that it isn't open on Sundays. I know it's because their short on staff so I understand but it would be nice if I was able to visit on my day off of work and relax there with a nice cup of coffee. Would visit more often if I had the time!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this place. The coffee was medicore and the service was a let down. We ordered two coffees (mochaccino and brewed coffee) and a sandwich. The mochaccino was prepared quickly but lacked any chocolate flavour. We had to to ask the server to add more chocolate but barely any was added. It felt like she was being skimpy with adding any more in. And there was no change in taste. Meanwhile it took 10 minutes before having to ask about the brewed coffee (I gave the benefit of the doubt that perhaps she was making a fresh batch) only to be told they never charged us for it. I'm not sure why we weren't charged when we did in fact order it. So we paid for a cup. 5 minutes later there was still no coffee and had to ask again if there was some reason for the delay. She admitted to forgetting, poured the cup and barely apologized for forgetting. Overall this experience was less than satisfactory. I can handle a medicore coffee with average customer  service but poor customer service is always a turn off. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly service providing very tasty food and drinks. Items are priced very well. The avocado & brie, and the pulled pork sandwiches are my favourite."}
{"text":"I love this place, the bacon lover is the best with my latte and french macaron. they have a cosy place and Tv. the only thing that I don't like, they close  a little early and the asian lady is always angry and rude. she should smile a little bit, I would visit more if they open in sunday it is a great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently discovered this cafe. Amazing drinks and food! I've had their iced coffee, matcha latte and iced matcha frappe. Drinks are way better than Starbucks!  The bacon lover sandwich is delicious! Lots of filling and the bacon is thick cut - yum. We both love it here and will definitely be trying to come here as often as we can. They also have a cute little patio so you can enjoy the weather outside! The decor is also beautiful and cozy inside too. Highly recommend coming here for food and drinks! We love it!  Ps. Customer service is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed many of their desserts with fresh fruit salad cup. Very friendly service. Must try their freshly made sandwiches or salads."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives in one of the condo complexes that this cafe is at. We try to support local businesses but some of the workers there have no soul. (Asian one with crimped hair) please smile :) you will feel better.  Anyway hope the best for the business! Will be back again :) their roasted chicken sandwich is delicious! Please order if you make a visit here."}
{"text":"Great Coffee, Amazing Fresh Sandwiches, a Hidden Gem of a Coffee Shop. This place does it right. They sell good products, fair prices, and good quality. They aren't trying to be fancy or wow you with membership cards and elite-est coffee B.S.  If you are in the area playing an Escape Game this is place to grab some Joe."}
{"text":"I popped in here one Saturday morning for a cup of coffee. In my opinion, not great coffee, but palatable. I also grabbed a custard tart and it was pretty tasty. There is a decent variety of treats on the menu. They also have bubble tea, but the tapioca isn't ready until the afternoon."}
