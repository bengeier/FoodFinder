{"text":"Papas is a nice Portuguese restaurant with friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. The place has dark furniture, modern art and dimmed lights. 

This is a tapas and martini bar, meaning that this restaurant only offers appetizers and drinks. Their menu consists of salads, lots of seafood and meat options. Their drinks are really good; I had their mojito and it was delish! Also, they have a nice selection of desserts. They had tiramisu, Portuguese cheeses, crème caramel, raspberry sorbet and more. Their desserts range from $7-$12.

I had their chicken breast which was around $12. The chicken was made to perfection and it tasted really good. However, even for an appetizer portion it was rather small- about a few bite sizes. 

Overall, this is a nice tapas restaurant with great tasting food. However, it is overpriced for the potions that you receive."}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese Tapas and Martini bar.  I believe they were running a special from 5-7 where women get a free martini with 3 tapas.  

I started off with a green salad that came with a nice balsamic vinaigrette.  I tried the shrimp with piri-piri sauce.  Their piri-piri sauce was a tomato based sauce with garlic, herbs and a hint of chili pepper.  I tried the seared tuna with a wine reduction sauce.  The tuna was seared rare, just the way I like it.  

I was quite surprised to watch my waiter walk out of the restaurant.  I'm not sure where he was going, but the remaining staff picked up right were he left off.

I will definitely have to go back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is great if you don't mind waiting obscenely long time for drinks.  We visited this place because we wanted a martini before dinner. We ordered a dirty martini and a Bombay sapphire martini (extra $3 during the 5-7pm happy hour--martinis free with each order of tapas, something like that).  We order the fried potatoes with rosemary and fried calamari.  Both were good, tasty, light and would have gone perfectly with the martinis had we got them in time.  It took over 30 minutes to get our drinks. When we got them, the dirty martini was more like a olive juice and gin.  To the waiters' credit, they were very accommodating, took the dirty martini back and replaced it, free of charge.  they earned their tip for sure."}
{"text":"This place was decent for tapas, but not the best I've ever had.  Highlights were the shrimp in piri-piri sauce, the cod with olive tapenade and chick pea sauce (hummus?), and the scallop (just one! don't be fooled) in the butternut squash soup.  The oyster mushrooms were bland and very so-so, especially after they cooled down after a couple minutes.  Service was just okay... nothing to really praise them about, but they did their job and it was fine.  The wine I had, a glass of white wine - Albis maybe? - was crap.  I didn't say anything about it, but I definitely was discouraged from ordering any other drink.  Steer clear of it!"}
{"text":"I visited their new location in The Village (1654 rue Sainte-Catherine East) and experienced the most terrible dining ever.  S L O W service, mixed-up orders, miniscule portions, exorbitant prices.  There is no reason to ever eat here."}
{"text":"Cet excellent bar à tapas, où on propose quelque 30 variantes de martinis, est une adresse à retenir du boulevard Saint-Laurent. Durant le 5 à 7, et ce chaque jour, on obtient un martini ou une bière gratuite à l'achat de tapas. Aussi, cet établissement ayant pour spécialité ce cocktail, j'y ai commandé un martini, qui était bien entendu bien réalisé... Pour ce qui était des tapas, je recommande les acras de morue, qui sont rien de moins que savoureux. Bref, c'est vraiment un petite bar dont il faut retenir l'adresse, puisqu'on en ressort forcément comblé."}
