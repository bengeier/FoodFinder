{"text":"I used to go to Rita's in the 90's. It was then a very authentic experience, right down to the superb food and the sometimes inability of staff to speak or understand English. A few weeks ago, wanting to show a visitor from L.A. that we have great Mexican food in Phoenix, we went to Rita's. Whenever it changed...it was not for the better. The food was thoroughly Americanized--salsas without bite, stale chips, bland cheesy sauces and dshes. An embarrassment"}
{"text":"Great food, very yummy. Food was hot, delicious and the staff was friendly even though it was almost closing time! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I've lived here nearly 30 years and this is the best Mexican food ever. Clean restaurant. Nice service from Armando and great food!"}
{"text":"Found this gem while looking for a non-chain restaurant before a concert at ak chin amphitheater. We were greeted by the manager who was all smiles and genuinely happy to be there. Our server Vanessa was great as well. She was pleasant and attentive. Food was WONDERFUL! Table side guac and a pitcher of premium margs to start, 4 entrees and dessert ran us 99 bucks which, for all the food and booze was a steal. This is our new go to for concerts at ak chin."}
{"text":"Been going here since the 80's always good.. this place has always been a treat.! One thing that hasn't changed \"thank god\" is the salsa"}
{"text":"Traveling cross country we were in search of a Mexican restaurant close to highway 10. Rita's popped up. Salsa was fresh and spicy. The chips were crisp. The carne asada and fish enchiladas were perfect. Our server Yuriria  was quick and extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"My first time at Rita was memorable.  From the food to the service everything was top notch. Aaron who is the bartender/manager/host is friendly and funny. The toritos are an amazing appetizer.  Aaron even offered to buy them for us if we did not like them. They are yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and then wrapped in bacon. My main course was the carne asada with a cheese enchilada. The meal came with rice, beans and a salad. My father had the shredded beef chimichunga. The rice and beans were not included with the chimichunga.  The rice is fluffy and flavorful.  The beef in the chimichunga was sweet but had great flavor. The service was very fast. Drinks were refilled very fast. Aaron is a great host and makes you feel like family.  We will be going back and will tell our friends about this amazing place."}
{"text":"Really like the food here we went to dinner last night. Our waiters was really friendly and attentive to or table even thought the place was busy. Seafood was fresh and tasted good.  We definitely will w back! Thank you"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and staff hidden in South Phoenix.  When friends come to visit this is the restaurant they all want to stop at."}
{"text":"I don't understand the great reviews! Aaron was a friendly guy, but only felt a slight buzz after two margaritas! Normally, I can't finish two! Ordered the toritos appetizer and the shrimp were very small and not very flavorful! The pepper was HOT! And it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce! Chips and salsa were ok, salsa was a little fiery. I ordered Chili Colorado, which on the menu came with a choice of red or green sauce. I ordered it with green sauce but Aaron said it came with red sauce. \"It's chili colorado which is red sauce.\" I asked him why it says with red or green sauce on the menu. I love chili verde but never had it with beef. I stuck with the red sauce. The sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough. The dish was quite salty and I happen to love salt, but it wasn't a good salty. The beans literally tasted like LARD! The rice was ok. My friend ordered carnitas which was supposed to be slow slimmered in sauce. Wish I would have taken a picture of it - pieces of burnt pork with no sauce whatsoever! He normally likes burnt meat, but the only edible pieces were the ones with fat! I give this place a two because the other two people in my party liked their food. I get better Mexican food back home in Las Vegas. For some reason we thought we'd be getting awesome Mexican food in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Delicious food ! If you want good Mexican food with a wide variety this is the place ! Horchata is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"I love the food here and frequent Rita's for lunch. Eight of us went to happy hour and much to my surprise completely different from lunch. with 2 tables occupied we sat down and waited for our server. she came over after about 20 minutes, we ordered drinks and then we waited for an hour, we then asked where our drinks were and we found out that no one on staff was old enough to serve alcohol. just a kid and what looked like her boy friend were so called working. Terrible experience and i will never go back for dinner/happy hour. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, I was shocked with the terrible experience. The management must change their evening operations."}
{"text":"It was great to finally get Sonoran Mexican food that showcased Mexican flavors instead of Americanized, cheese-drowned versions of Mexican food.  The Patron margaritas are the real deal and a steal at only $9 as the glasses are enormous.  The Chili Colorado offered lots of meat and a good red chili sauce.  The Pablano Relleno was lightly battered and stuffed with flavorful shredded chicken with a light cheese sauce floating in a plate of red chili sauce, it was the right touch of cheese.    One of the best parts of the meal was the beans.  They are authentic as you get the pork flavor you are supposed to get from beans when they are done right and made with ham hocks or other pork parts!  I didn't ask how the beans were prepared but they taste like they were made with an old school recipe.    We liked the fried ice cream with the cinnamon shell over the sopapillas as they were a little to doughy.  This and the fundillo are the only reasons I am going with 4 instead of 5 stars.  The cheese fundillo was more of a thin Monterrey cheese than the traditional thick Mexican cheese, however, the chorizo on top was excellent.   It wasn't that it was bad it just wasn't what we were looking for in a fundillo.    We are hard to please when it comes to authentic Mexican food and this will be our new go to place as it is unbelievably hard to find good Mexican food in Phoenix/Tempe and this was worth the drive.    We can't wait to go back to try the seafood and grilled carne platters."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in the area (which is infrequently), we come to Rita's. The chips and salsa are great - though a little too spicy for my gringo husband. I have enjoyed both entrees I've purchased (the carne adobada and the combo with the beef tamale, shrimp taco and chicken enchilada). My husband got a little more adventurous (and expensive) and got the Azteca and didn't care for it. Also have to disagree with other Yelpers on the Toritos. They aren't extremely tasty with the exception of the sauce - and we took the extra sauce home because there was way too much of it and we used it as steak sauce. I wish they would bottle it and sell it separately! Margaritas are also tasty, but not extremely strong. Go and support your local AZ businesspeople. To me, it's better than Valle Luna and many other self-proclaimed \"authentic\" joints."}
{"text":"The food at Rita's is fantastic, the prices are very reasonable, the interior is handsomely designed, and the people who work there are always friendly.  My overall impression is that there is a deep commitment to excellence from the kitchen to the table. The shrimp wrapped in bacon is awesome! I drive in to Phoenix from out of town, have been there more than once, have brought guests, and look forward to the next time I visit."}
{"text":"First time here at Ritas, and I can't say enough positive things about it!! Our server was Eva and she was AMAZING super friendly and knew alot about the menu which was helpful for our first visit. Food was very good, the service was fast and the pricing was decent. If i did have to pick one down side it would be the outside curb appeal. It shares a plaza with an auto shop and looks kinda run down, but once you get inside its very clean, welcoming and decorated nicely! Totally worth it. We definitely will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We come here often and they always treat us great! Tonight our waiter Michelle was great, very attentive. Their micheladas are the best!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. The server was friendly but seemed overworked. The chips and salsa was excellent. I ordered the machaca chimi and it was very good. Did not come with rice and beans but was enough food itself. I would recommend this to people who want more than chain Mexican food."}
{"text":"We have been going to Rita's for about 2 years now.  They always have had consistently good food, until we went in for lunch on Thursday.  We both ordered the combo plate with 2 shrimp tacos and a chicken enchilada. The shrimp tacos were nothing like they usually are.  Each tortilla had at least 3/4 of a cup of onions and green bell peppers and 3 very small shrimp.  The enchiladas were also filled with onions and green bell pepper and what looked like chicken from those nasty leg quarters you can buy for 39 cents a pound at Food City.  So sad, but we won't give up on Rita's just yet.  Hopefully they just have a new cook for lunch who doesn't know what he is doing yet."}
{"text":"Really good.  It was sold to new ownership, and the tradition lives, with even better food.  Try the Rellenos.  Theirs are goos."}
{"text":"My time at Rita's has been Amazing! I came there to celebrate my mother's birthday, and the enchiladas was amazing, the margaritas were great. Our waitress, Gabby was very nice and helpful. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came here for Rita's for dinner on a groupon . The waitress Debbie was very nice to us she sat us down at our table handed us a menu and told us to order anything on the menu. She also told us they will be doing something special on Valentine's  I can't wait  I'm definitely coming back to see what they have in store for the loved ones for that day the special day. Very nice lighting so if you want to come here at like for an anniversary romantic dating this would be the right place to go it's not really noisy here and the service is really good and the food is absolutely delicious I would give this place higher than a five-star. I had a very nice dinner and  everything I order was fresh and hot.The service is fast did not have to wait long for our order.I would recommend this restaurant for everyone."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have found in years. Salsa and chips are excellent. I go at least once a week. Great carnitas, carne asada."}
{"text":"Great value for a sit down place. Food was good. Getting into the parking lot was a little tight, but manageable."}
{"text":"Groupon took us to this restaurant today, we arrived at about 3pm and the restaurant was slow.  Aaron was our waiter and led us to wonderful selections on the menu.  We would rate Rita's salsa pretty close to the best salsa we have ever had!  Aaron was also our bartender and he mixed us up two fabulous margaritas.  We had Parrillada del Rancho for Two for lunch/dinner - the price was very reasonable for the amount of food that was delivered!  The platter had freshly seasoned carne asada, grilled chicken breast and pork chop accompanied by grilled vegetables, served with rice, beans, pico and fresh tortilla's.  No way could we eat it all and we definitely left with full tummy's and a nice to go box!  Plus, we felt this was possibly the best Mexican food we have had in the eight years we have been visiting various Mexican food establishments here in Phoenix.  Bravo Rita's!!  We will be back and we will recommend you to our friends and family."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about Rita's!  We stumbled on the restaurant driving out of Phoenix and headed for the bay area.  What a great find!  Love the food, service, and great pricing.  I had the Baja California shrimp - the sauce...as well as the rest of the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas for 20 years, and AZ for 10, I have eaten in a lot of Mexican Food Restaurants. My wife and I went to Rita's tonight and I can honestly say that this is the best Mexican Food place I have eaten in in a very very long time.  The Food was excellent (Rocky Point style), the Service was really really good. The salsa is to die for. I ate more chips and salsa than I should have, but it was so so good. I learned that the woman who makes this salsa, has not shared the recipe with ANYONE. It is that good.  First things first, we were greeted with what I thought was your basic typical red salsa and chips. Wrong! The chips were typical but the red salsa was definitely not! Things were great so far. But things got a lot better.  Then we had the Toritos Appetizer: Yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon with a really tasty sauce. Oh my, what amazing taste!  My wife had a beautiful dish named Parrillada del Rancho. The food tasted great, but it came in a Tericotta serving dish. I have never ever seen anything like it before. It added something to the meal that is beyond belief.  I usually come to a mexican restaurant with my pre-conceived notion of what I like. Well I like what I like, and have for a long time. But tonight I decided to get something a little different - I got the Camarones cobijados (Shrimp in a Blanket). Strimp stuffed with crab meat and wrapped in bacon. Yes, as Emeril says pork fat rules. I love bacon. This was really a good call on my part. It was great.  Our waitress was very helpful, she was prompt, she refilled my water glass several times without my asking. Just a great evening. And the best part? I only live about 20 minutes away, and I didn't even know this place existed. Well I do NOW.  All in all, I would give this place 6 stars out of 5.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, prompt service and good food for reasonable pricing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this place and sadly was disappointed. The food was great, I have zero complaints about the food but the service was awful. We had Aaron and it started out great but I had a groupon deal which he pretty much told me was useless and charged for stuff I had already paid for through groupon. I asked him about it and he pretty much said I was being cheap and dismissed my concerns. Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again. That experience just left a bad taste in my mouth. Also...we were a big party and talking to others afterwards, they too felt like Aaron was a jerk to us."}
{"text":"The burrito ruined the meal and that was the main dish. I ordered the carnitas burrito with side rice and beans. The rice and beans were great, not salty like a lot of other Mexican food joints. The burrito was mostly tortilla and the carnita I did get was dry and was not fresh. I had to remove most of the tortilla and add salsa so it would not by so dry. I would have giving this place a 1 star but the rice, beans, salsa, and chips were very good."}
{"text":"At first I was a little concerned about the location. But the restaurant was very clean both in & out, had a fun atmosphere & was a gem of a find through Groupon   The table side guac is super delicious.  And Aaron makes a helluva margarita. The service was outstanding & extremely personable at all levels."}
{"text":"Armando was our server and was very attentive. Nice atmosphere and reasonable prices. Very hot salsa. Guac could have used a little salt."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and excellent service! The food and the Margaritas are to die for! Try it, it is worth it. Ever, Erin and Paulina always make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome."}
{"text":"Wow! We wish we lived around here so we could go back again.  The food was fabulous, so delicious, authentic and healthy too. My husband loved that he had several choices of grilled fish to choose from. Our teens enjoyed their assorted tacos and I liked having so many great options in their combo section of the menu. I ended up with a steak taco & a grilled shrimp, both cooked perfectly.  They have an extended happy hour with great deals on drinks.  Nice ambience, good service and a perfect family dinner!"}
{"text":"As always the food was again great.  Had the menudo. It was excellent almost as good as my mom's (you know mom's is the best. At least 95% of the time)  The waitress was so busy but was able to take care of her tables and keep us satisfied.   Will continue returning back.  Love it here."}
{"text":"First time trying out Rita's! Let me just start with how amazing the service was as soon as we entered! All staff was very friendly and helpful, especially YURI & ARMANDO. They make sure to give great service and satisfy your needs. The food is very fresh, authentic, delicious & they give big portions! My boyfriend and I started with the must have appetizer, Toritos, a yellow pepper stuffed with shrimp then wrapped in bacon with a tasty sauce! (Add cream cheese you will not regret it!)   This place is very clean and has beautiful paintings around,  I am usually not a big fan of most Mexican restaurants but Rita's definitely will be seeing us again!!!   I had the Parrillada Playa Bonita, mixed grilled and breaded shrimp, two fillets of white sea bass, served grilled and breaded chicharones de pescado   Pargo and a lobster tail. My boyfriend had the Fried Tilapia.   Once again, thank you Rita's wait staff and cooks, you have gained a new customer see you soon!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Gabby was our server and She was polite and very attentive. I liked how the shrimp was cleaned and the menudo was clean as well. I'd recommend and it's appropriate for all family members. The inside of the restaurant it's cute as a button! Great food, customer experience and most of all great prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! WE picked up a Groupon and decided to check this place out. I'm all for a new Mexican restaurant and Rita's did NOT disappoint! It's right off the I-10 at 35th ave, super easy to get to. We started with the table side Guacamole, which was perfect! two HUGE avocados and super fresh chips. The house salsa was also perfect! The next dish we got was the seafood cocktail de molcatejes (sp?) Talk about a humongoid bowl of awesomeness! (See the pic I posted). it was full of shrimp, octopus, scallops and fresh veggies ($20). I went with this mixed grill Plate, that had pork, beef and chicken with griled veggies and peppers! Thsi thing came out still sizzling on a huge platter! Talk about wow factor! Tehy have a seafood version for a few bucks more, definitely a killer dish. All in all, the food  was fantastic, the service was awesome and we'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Not excellent. Some drunken bar fly kept trying to get into the bathroom while I was using it. After announcing loudly that he had to (explicit term for using the restroom), he decided to use the ladies room.  He walked in on a woman who screamed. He walked away chortling. Kinda ruined the experience. The bartender should have kicked him out right then, but instead served him up another red eye. $77 for two adults and one 9 year old before tip is pretty pricey for Mexican food. La Pinta margarita is a must try, really good and not too strong. Posole is pretty good. They give you a lot! We'll come back based on location if we ever need a quick Mexican fix and don't mind paying extra for the convenience. The waitresses were all very polite."}
{"text":"Awesome and Authentic Mexican Food, great service too, will recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love me some yummy fajitas; that's about the only \"Mexican\" food i love; so I ordered a steak fajita & a shrimp fajitas platter, with the amount of food & all the sides, I left feeling super satisfied. Other places can be stingy with the amount of shrimp they give, so I was super ecstatic that there were much more than 5 shrimps! Staff was nice & I got myself a deal online so it was a super great deal as well!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food I've had in a while.  Get the Chile Colorado or Carne Asada- seriously delish!  I can't wait to try the seafood next time."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here after reading the recommendation on Thrill List.com as Rita's being one of 7 Phoenix restaurants having the best chimichangas.  They were spot on!  We both had the Asada (steak) chimis and they were amazing!!  The service was wonderful and the restaurant was clean!  Visit Rita's...you will love it!"}
{"text":"I always have a pleasant experience here. The food is good, the portions generous, and the staff friendly. I must penalize them one star, however, for raising the price of their Groupon voucher. I would not eat here without the voucher."}
{"text":"Very attentive service, great authentic food and tasty margaritas! Highly recommend the molcajete!"}
{"text":"Boy am I happy I tried this place.  Let's go chronologically. Love the surroundings, definitely has a cozy feel inside. The service was great, absolutely loved our waitress.   The margaritas(one house, one frozen sunset) were awesome. I almost never drink them or like them, but I managed to enjoy this one, that says something. The salsa was delicious with a great kick to it. I had the adobada while my buddy had the tampiquena. Both dishes were fantastic, the rice and beans were phenomenal. Loved every bit of it. Nothing was too greasy, everything very nice and hot and came out quick.   For dessert we had flan and sopapillas, both some of the best I've ever had. I can't recommend this place enough. GO GO GO."}
{"text":"This was such an excellent meal. So worth finding Rita's. The table side guacamole and Rita's Parrillada made for one of the best Mexican meals we have enjoyed. Don't miss Rita's!"}
{"text":"No other way to put it, this place is really good. Green chili chimi was on point, the meat was flavorful and moist. Drinks a little light on alcohol but still good. Looking at the back of the house/kitchen area there were dishes everywhere but not dirty. Juke box is nice! Good service. Make sure you don't sit by the bathroom!!"}
{"text":"We were passing by Phoenix area on our way to San Diego. We were hungry and wanted something quick and close to the freeway (I10) that way we don't lose that much time driving around the Dtwn Phoenix area... and then BAM Ritas was exactly what we were looking for.   Walked in and was greeted right away by the friendly employees.   We opted to take the food to go and eat it in the car since we had our dogs with us.... We did not want to leave them alone in the car plus it was very hot (over 85/90 degrees).  Once the order was placed, it did take about 20-25 mins to get my food which was a bit of a long time to wait... I did over hear one of the girls asking for my order and I think they just forgot to make it otherwise I would have been in and out of there- after all it does not take that long to make machaca con huevos.   In any event, once I got the food darted to my car and ate it then and there. Some of the employees did come out of the back and notice we were eating in the car... LOL they looked so confused and probably where asking themselves what the heck!?!?!? But again had my furry babies in the car and did not want to leave them alone. Did they enjoy fresh chips and tortillas with us.   Service: OK Location: convenient  Staff: Friendly  Food: very tasty  Maybe next time we are in town, we can eat inside- ha!"}
{"text":"Only knocking it down a couple of notches for stale chips and flavorless Carne Asada.  If a mexican food place has really good beans and rice, everything else is usually pretty good.  I opted for a three item combo with a Ground Beef Enchilada, Carne Asada Taco and a Chicken Tostada.  First of all the beans and rice are stellar, very very good .  My Carne Asada Taco had no flavor whatsoever and was heavily over cooked.  Enchilada was very good, chicken tostada was just ok.  Very good salsa with very stale chips.  Table was sticky and menu had food all over it and hadn't been wiped down.  I'd go back again, would just be a little wiser with my selections next time.  If you're a guerro you'll feel a little out of place here!  All in all good but the minor negatives I mentioned kick my rating down!"}
{"text":"I purchased groupon for ritas so I decided to go .I went around lunch time it was really full , they greeted us and we sat down we got chips and salsa really good drinks came right away  they were really good , we ordered food came right away which was really good waitress came a lot to check on us which is good we gavw hwr groupon no problem ,now my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want a quick touristy place to eat this place is okay. Not the best Mexican food, but the service is really good, hard-working nice kids.  Their chips and salsa are fake, they don't make their chips, salsa is uninteresting and tomatoey. Also their flavored margaritas are sugary sweet, so again not a place I want to go to for great Mexican meal but a fun touristy place if you just want to hang out"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is HORRIFIC.  It could be the 'white plight'....ie. they don't care for white people."}
{"text":"The $5 margaritas the size of my head was excellent. The table side guacamole was fresh and tasty. Food is incredible!!! Tacos, crispy, fresh, good flavor. Loved it. Server was kind, friendly, personable. Great find!"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places to eat at whenever we're in West Phoenix. The manager Aaron got us hooked on the toritos - shrimp stuffed bacon wrapped yellow chilis...so good. One of my other favorites is the shrimp cocktail served in a coconut, let me tell you...they don't skimp on the shrimp either! What they can't fit in the coco, they serve on the plate...it's super filling and delicious! Overall, every dish we've tried there has been good, so you can't go wrong coming here! The staff is extemely nice and your chips and salsa are brought to your table before you even get settled in! Keep up the good work, Aaron!!"}
{"text":"The shredded beef chimichanga was amazing! The meat was juicy, with the added bell peppers only complicated the chimi. The churro beans with mex rice were flavorful."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great Mexican restaurant since we moved here 4 years ago. Rita's is the real deal!  Great atmosphere, incredible staff - we loved Lupita, and the food was fantastic. We drove from Sun City West and don't regret a minute of the drive."}
{"text":"The food was just alright. Really great happy hour specials for drinks. ****BEWARE**** for our party of 4 (not 8 or 10) they added automatic gratuity. The fast and not thorough explanation given to my boyfriend was \"yeah..we already add on gratuity\". Ok...where is that posted? Is that legal? Gratuity is an incentive. Don't get me wrong, I tip, but I don't like being forced into something. I actually tip more than their forced tip charge. Just doesn't sit right with me when that isn't made clear. ****Seems deceitful.****"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything here that I didn't enjoy! Armando, our server, was on top of everything and his recommendations were spot on. Perfect lunch spot. You get so much food for how little they charge you!"}
{"text":"Not quite \"hole-in-the-wall,\" but definitely Mexican restaurant feel with Frida Kahlo paintings up and Mexican music as soon as you walk through the door. Customer service was great. We were greeted immediately and offered to select our seating preference. The server was able to have the kitchen staff make me a custom grilled fish burro (aka burritos) with rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, and grilled vegetables. The tortilla tasted homemade (although not sure if it was). My boyfriend had the shrimp fajitas that were well cooked and well seasoned, and it came with 3 tortillas (also tasted homemade), and he could've ate one more because it was that good. Overall, a positive experience and we would return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Ate there for the first time about 5 months ago and I have probably been back at least 6 times. The house margarita is tasty and strong. The guacamole is reallly good. The salsa for the chips is so damn good. And the food is well seasoned. The service is also great. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Second time to Rita's.  The best Mexican food in the valley.  Great mix of real Mexican style recipes (the seafood) sonoran/southwest style favorites, and even fajitas (which I haven't had yet but given lack of good fajitas in az I bet these will be great.   The Chile rellenos I had today was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review...so read carefully. Not great chips or salsa...no worries. I don't like to fill up on this anyway and my homemade salsa is exceptional. The chile relleno was recommended and just ok. The rice is nice and fluffy...again...I make better at home. Great lard rich refried beans. Now...where the excellence is found...the grilled shrimp dinner WITH potatoes and homemade flour tortillas.  The shrimp is amazig with  crisp quartered red potatoes with salty garlicky yumminess and the tortillas are not those pastey white store purchased blecky things. The service was ok...the gal was new, so you gotta go with that. Super nice though."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the owner (I believe) and he was very warm and made us feel welcome.  He recommeded the stuffed peppers with shrimp , wrapped in bacon and it was delicious!  He was genuinely excited about his food/service and it shows.   I doubt I will be back because of the very long distance from my house but I'd love for him to have a restaurant in California!  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant ! If you're looking for good Mexican food this is definitely the place ."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday amazing guacamole  Prepared in front of you Great food and drinks don't let the surrounding area fool you those are the best places to eat and it doesn't break the bank"}
{"text":"As their sign says: Autentica Comida Mexicana. The food, the vibe, the service - all excellent. My friend and fellow yelper John M. and I had quite a feast here. Acting on advice from the reviews I read here, I ordered the seafood enchilada - it was pure ambrosia, loaded with juicy shrimp and fish cooked just right. John had the garlic shrimp and let me try some of it; the shrimp was succulent and the garlic flavor intense - I loved it! Caveat: I'm a very big fan of garlic and am one of those people who believe that you can never have too much garlic in a dish, so some of you might find the flavor on the aggressive side if you order it. But I know it's what I'll be ordering next time ;)   The generous and tasty house margaritas were a perfect complement to the delightful repast.."}
{"text":"Great food with exceptional service. Our server Yumayra was awesome!!! She made great suggestions. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch there today - not near my normal stomping ground but it looked like a decent place so I took a chance.  Inside, clean and bright and a mix of biz people at lunch, local workers, some families.  Server was prompt, nice and spoke English fluently.  They brought out chips & salsa and the salsa was fantastic... fresh, home-made and had a nice kick.  I chose a $6.95 combo plate - taco, bean tostada and enchilada.  5 minutes after ordering it was served up.  What immediately stood out was everything was simple and light.  The taco wasn't greasy - just some tasty meat, lettuce and white cheese.  The tostada was similar - just a simple base with some really nice refried beans (def not from a can) and crispy lettuce/tomato and white cheese.  The enchilada was good as well.  I prefer  New Mexico style enchiladas, with a really hot sauce, so i rarely order them outside of NM because they are usually bland.  This had a red sauce that wasn't hot, but was definitely homemade and flavorful.   Overall it was pretty straightforward, simple, yet flavorful fare and seemed a lot less heavy/greasy than typical places.  And I'm often fine with greasy, though the beltline would disagree.  I'd defintely frequent the place if it was near, though it's not so special to merit an out-of-the-way trip.  It's a place where they care about making good grub and that shows.  If you're near or going to be in the area, it's worth exploring."}
{"text":"Found by chance,  would definitely go back. I had the Chilaquilas con huevos abd they were tasty and the beans were even better"}
{"text":"My wife and I just went to Rita's for dinner. The food and the service were great. Our waiter Armando took very good care of us. We had the fajitas and they were very good we would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We had the appetizer the bacon wrapped child's which were pretty good. We then split the carne asada plate which was plenty of food for the two of us. The service was good, the salsa was good and we will come back for lunch."}
{"text":"After a full afternoon on Saturday we chose to try a different Mexican restaurant than our norm & so glad we did, I actually think we found our new spot!! We came around 7 pm, therefore when I didn't see the parking lot bursting at the seems I was kind of skeptical at first but I'm glad that I trusted my nose because the smells that were oozing from this establishment definitely pulled us in. When you walk in you definitely have that feel of a Mexican restaurant with the big chunky wood tables & benches that actually seemed to be custom made as the booths had their name Rita's carved into each booth. I just loved the feel & vibe I was getting from the place & then our wonderful server Debbie greeted us, she was as sweet as could be, also extremely helpful in our decision making. My hubby had the traditional Tecate beer & I chose a classic margarita on the rocks that had such a kick to it that I felt it once I stood to take extra pics, lol!! We chose to start with the chicken quesadilla minus the onions, then my hubby chose the steak fajitas & I went with the bacon wrapped shrimp with Mexican rice. As we were waiting for all the deliciousness to arrive we started on the complimentary chips & salsa, the chips were light & crispy, freshly made......the salsa had a perfect consistency with just the right amount of spice! Then here came the quesadilla & OMG, next time I'll just choose that for my meal because it was beyond fresh & delicious with its homemade tortilla, the fresh veggies, moist chicken & perfect amount of cheese. We had to stop eating it or they would had to make our entrees to go because the quesadilla was actually that big!! Okay now here comes the entrees, my hubby's steak fajitas were perfectly seasoned & cooked, with the fresh made tortillas on the side. He was devouring his meal that he didn't even have room for the refried beans or the salad. Now I had my 6, yes 6 bacon wrapped shrimp that had fresh blue crab.....mind you no bread crumbs....... tucked inside this concoction that were cooked just right & tasted even better. FYI you must be a bacon fan to order this dish because this restaurant doesn't know the meaning of skimping on ingredients, loved it!! Also had the Mexican rice which was so good that I had to finish the rice since it's not that good to reheat, lol!! Yes I think we've found our new go to spot for our Mexican fix, love the ambiance, great service, perfect prices & awesome food.... what more could you ask for!!"}
{"text":"The food is always good and the staff always friendly. We're there at least every couple of weeks and the server always seems to remember us. If you're a fan of carnitas then you have try them; they are outstanding."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant,  friendly service,  great, fresh seafood! Affordable, and delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"Ritas never fails to deliver a great Mexican meal at good prices.  Tried the chicken chimy really good as is all the other items I have had. Aaron is gr a at server bar tr nder"}
{"text":"The best, and by all means try the Bacon wrapped chili appetizer."}
{"text":"My waitress Debbie was amazing... Her service was fast and friendly, The food here is always great...... Recommended to everyone .."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!!! The service is always top notch! Every dish I've had is exceptional:) highly recommend it for authenticity of the food with that spicy kick to it! Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"It was OK. I've had a lot of Mexican food and there was nothing that stood out about the food"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.    We've only been here twice, but both times were amazing.  The seafood and the tacos were great.    The service is also great.    Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Sorry yelpers this was awful!  Cheese crisp was made with an old tortilla.  Like eating thick paper.  Sick.  Cheese was barely melted.  We ordered a three combo plate 2 tacos and a cheese enchilada.  Plate was not even hot.  Cheese not melted in the enchilada and the tacos were on these weird shells.   So disappointing and a whopping 35$ with tip. We were expecting 5 star food from all the reviews......only thing we can imagine is they have never had really good authentic Mexican food.  Big big let down.  Never again.  Sick sick sick."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the area of 35th Ave and I-10, to our metal fabricator, for years and finally stopped into Rita's. Worth. Every. Bite. Salsa was delicious and spicy and the chips were warm. The decor was fun, bright and inviting. I ordered my favorite measure of a Mex food place; cheese enchilada, taco, rice and beans. I added a tostada so I could pile on that great salsa. Very very good, tender seasoned meat and bold enchilada sauce. My only complaint is the rice which has too much tomato in it. My husband had the carne asada steak and it was so tender and flavorful. We will be back every time were in the area! We live in Chandler"}
{"text":"Manager is pretty GREAT! And Eva bartender pretty great too! First time stop because I was thirsty for margarita . They served well! Enjoyed time there!!!! I will be back for Molcajette !!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was average food, at best, with below average service.  I waited 15 minutes for sour cream and getting the bill was complicated.  Overrated place"}
{"text":"Really good place. Wife and I tried it for the first time when looking for a place close to Laveen but didn't want a long wait. Food was good but not outstanding. The atmosphere was great! 90's hip hop with good food and great people. Definitely coming back here to try the flan!  Atmosphere: 5 Food: 4 Parking: 3 Price: 4 Wait staff: 4"}
{"text":"Very very delicious authentic Mexican food. Friendly and helpful waitress, we got our food out pretty fast and the serving size was huge! Prices are very good for the amount of food you get, we both had enough to get super full and take some home. This is going to be my boyfriend's and my new place to get amazing authentic mexican food!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Best Mexican food I have ever had. Great service and clean restaurant too. We went 2 times in 3 nights.... That says a lot."}
{"text":"Went here because it was recommended by 2 co-workers and we also had a Groupon. We will be back, the food was amazing, the service was excellent, not very busy and service was fast. We will be going back, prices were reasonable even if we didn't have the Groupon."}
{"text":"So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what.  I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck in between two choices:  Rita's and another unnamed Phoenix establishment that we had already been to that is always solid never great.  Well, what the hell, let's give Rita's a shot.  Nice and conveniently located on 35th and the I-10, we find a spot and get in.  Order a few margaritas and they were great.  I'm not the world's biggest fan of the marg but Aaron knows how to hook it up.  Next, we ordered the table side Guac, I got the Playa Bonita, the lady got the Seafood enchiladas.  Everything was OUTSTANDING.  I tried her enchiladas and they were dynamite and I had about 4 different kinds of fish that were all cooked perfectly.  Service was outstanding, food was fantastic, there was absolutely no reason this place wasn't jam packed on a Saturday night.  I suggest you go support a local business that does things right.  I love Pappadeaux as much as the next guy and can say that Rita's stands just as tall next to them in service and food quality.   You won't get the white tablecloth but you will have an extra $50 in your pocket when you leave and be just as satisfied."}
{"text":"Very, very authentic mexican food, one of the best Mexican food places in Phoenix, AZ. They're salsas are really good as well"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican food restaurant!!The food is always amazing and Michelle always provides excellent service. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food and great margaritas this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The fiesta platter with queso as well as, the beef tamales are excellent. I will be coming back if I am in this area again."}
{"text":"A friend told me this place was a place to get great Mexican food.  We got lunch from there today. Prices were high. We spent over $50 for lunch for three people.  For that price you think the food would be unbelievable, well it wasn't.  It was more like tasteless and less than remarkable.  Definitely will not be eating there again or recommending them to anyone.  Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Groupon find. Waitress was great and attentive. The beans and rice were really good! Everything tasted fresh and the serving was huge. The salsa was spicy and delicious. Interior was decorated nicely and everyone seemed to be having a really good time in there.  Overall I was really satisfied with the entire dining experience. I gave 4 stars because while the food was good it didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"So delicious. The chips were warm and both salsas....couldn't decide which was better. Devoured both. Waitresses were friendly and quick with service.  We had a variety of food ordered and everyone in our group agreed it was a great meal. Good find. Only regret is we aren't from the area and can't frequent Rita's."}
{"text":"This place is the best thing going on in this area.    In a neighborhood known more for warehouses than restaurants I was pleasantly surprised by how good Rita's is.  Great salsa - and definitely above average food!  Great rice, tasty beans, and the shrimp flautas were awesome!     I've also had the huevos and chorizo there which were spot on delicious!  Friendly staff and clean dining area."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night. Very quiet. Service was friendly, but not \"perfect\". (I had to remind our server about bringing me water, and we had our beer (him) and margarita (me) before chips and salsa were served!) Chips and salsa were delicious. My margarita was mostly that bottled mix stuff.  I fixed it by ordering a shot of tequila and a bunch of lime wedges, lol! He had the parrillada de rancho (spelling problems mine) and I had the shrimp fajitas. The corn tortillas were perfection, beans great. We both liked the carne asada from his plate, actually grilled, not steamed. My fajitas could have used more vegetables, cooked less, but it was very tasty all around. Too full to try desserts and we brought leftovers home. We had a groupon, but we'll be back! I need to try the albondigas soup, posole, ceviche tostadas.... Etc."}
{"text":"Found a jewel in Phoenix area. First time but definitely not last visit. The seafood tostada was packed with fish, shrimp, octopus, clams topped with avocado. White or Red Menudo so delicous.. Nopales, potatoes and eggs... Yummy"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Mexican food. But since I'm here in Phoenix I gotta try it. The food was very good. The server was friendly. Would definitely recommend this place. Big portion though."}
{"text":"As visitors we always look for places the locals go and Rita's appeared to be just what we were looking for. It was great!  The atmosphere and neighborhood may not be fancy but since it is right off the freeway what do expect?  Service was very friendly and efficient, the food was great (especially the salsa). We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've always driven by it (since childhood) and finally stopped in last weekend. OMG! Why did I wait so long to try this place out?! Their menudo is soooo good!!!! It's really hard to find a place that has good menudo! You have to try this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been consistently disappointed with the Mexican restaurants I've sampled in Phoenix; one would think with the proximity that one would be able to easily obtain good fare. Well, my search has ended! Rita's serves fresh, delectable, authentic food. Try the peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped with bacon!   The margaritas were great. The service was great. They even put up with my poor attempts at the language.   We used a Groupon, but wouldn't hesitate to come here without one."}
{"text":"I wan't sure about this place when we first arrived as it is just off the freeway and shares a parking lot with a Mexican auto / tire shop.  However, when you step inside, this little gem looks like it belongs in Old Town Scottsdale.  I made a mistake and order my old standby, shredded beef tacos.  Don't get me wrong, they were okay, but nothing like my GF's order.  She order the steak fajitas which were amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas either one of us has ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.  I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!  If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's!"}
{"text":"So I went to this place becouse of the reviews on YELP..boy was i disappointed!.. The first time i went for lunch at 1pm...music is way to load, waitresx was one person changed to another petson who took our order changed to another person who delivered our food changed another 3 times , got lost on who to ask for the check.  Felt i got served left overs  Second time took my mother for dinner, music to load, mom had to yell when speaking,  food had too much onions, felt like i ordered onion tacos instead of meat tacos, again a revolving door of waitresses, asked for 2 coffees, never delivered,  asked 2 waitresses for the check. Took too long to get check..Food was over priced!..Could have been better. Gave this place two chances and you know what they say...once shame on you, twice shame on me, BUT NEVER A 3RD TIME!... Restaurant Impossible should stop by and help this establishment.  It has potential  BUT NOT TAKING MY BUSINESS THERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I come in from Orange County every 5-6 weeks on business and stay for a few days. I make sure to eat here every time I come into town. Food is awesome and staff is very friendly. Love the carnitas plate!"}
{"text":"Hit up Rita's after work using the Groupon I bought (2nd time around). Decor is BRIGHT and beautiful-glassware is festive. Food was superb-margaritas were amazing. Service is spotty evidently. First time we came here-our service was GREAT-even on a Saturday night-our server was attentive and we left a hefty tip to show our appreciation. This time around (a Wed night) it just wasn't the same service. Our server forgot things (tortillas) they weren't attentive and when we asked for tortilla's (to be served with our meal) it took a long time to get them and we both got flour instead of asking for corn. We won't let this experience stop us, we're going to try it again and hopefully will have better servers next time!"}
{"text":"A friend and I used a groupon today for a spur of the moment dinner.  We were very pleased with the choices on the menu.  I had the seafood platter.  My friend enjoyed a green chile burrito, enchilada style.  Excellent choices.  We had too much food after enjoying the $5 happy hour margaritas and the excellent chips and salsa.  That's ok...I love to have the leftovers for lunch the next day.   Hats off to Aaron the manager.  He took great care to give us a great experience along with our meal."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to update my review from 5 stars to 2 stars. Margaritas were awful, service was awful, server did not know happy hour drink special and we had to point on the billboard the prices, instead of checking, she immediately informed that alcohol drinks were not o happy hour.   She cleared chips and salsa without asking us if we were done. Horrible experience compared to previous visits. We will try one more time as this may have just been a fluke.   Fingers crossed..."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Mexican food. If I could give them 10 stars I would. They are great from food, pricing, cleanliness and customer service. Highly recommend it, this is my families new favorite place to go to."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. But they got 2 out of the 3 meals wrong. And started mopping the floor around us before we were ready to go. There was 30 minutes left before closing. Will not return."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas chimichanga  It was excellent. This was my second visit to this location."}
{"text":"Most excellent!!! Whole fried red snapper gorgeous to look at and great tasting. Service was A-1 couldn't ask for more. This is a gem of a Mariscos restaurant."}
{"text":"A little tricky to get to but worth it. Food has been great every time we go. Service can be a bit slow depending on who is working. Great grilled platters and the torittos are a must."}
{"text":"Food is good as well as the service! Came here from a Groupon well worth it was $17 for $30 worth of food."}
{"text":"We tried this Mexican Food , because we had a Groupon on it.  We let the Groupon run out so, decided to try it anyway's.  We were very surprise at this authentic design, an very nice decor. The waiter was very polite, quick to wait on us, an wanted to know if he need to explain any foods to us.  He was really terrific his name was Armando!  They have a nice bar an great margaritas\"s.  The food was very special, because it was a little different than usual.  They had little piece's of celery in the fried rice.  Also, my fajitas had red pepper, green pepper, lots of onions, an tomatoes.  The chicken was very tender.  Also, my husband got chili relieno, an he said they were really good.  They even gave him two big ones with rice an beans.  I don't think  you will be disappointed in Rita's or the staff."}
{"text":"Went to Rita's for lunch with my husband. Place is very nice. Food was Good! My husband ordered Nopales con Huevo breakfast & it came accompanied with beans, potatoes & tortillas. Very good! I ordered \"Make your own combo\" which comes accompanied with rice and beans. I chose 2 items- 1 shrimp grilled taco, which was  Very Good! And 1 beef shredded taco, also good. Will definitely go back. Oh, forgot to mention I ordered 1 fried ice cream & it was sooooo good. The fried ice cream was placed inside a bu?uelo cinnamon & sugar bowl  & drizzled with chocolate....yummmm sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"Classic Tex-Mex style for This part of the country. Well maintained and clean restaurant. Home made style Enchilada and Chile Rellenó combo was not over done with cheese. Didn't get any tortillas as part of my meal but I could have easily asked for some. The bar is small but they do a variety of margarita's that satisfy!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  It's not your run of the mill, ordinary Mexican eatery that you see on the street every other mile in Phoenix.    The menu is filled with creative Mexican dishes and all are reasonably priced.  I was hungry when I arrived and happily satisfied when I left.  I will come back here the next time I'm in town.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Warm authentic Mexican environment.  This place will make you feel like you're south of the border!"}
{"text":"Clean, service is on point. Really good grilled fish tacos and ceviche. Servers have hot chip bags to go. Home made horchata . Special tip: ask the ladies for chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"My friend and I are trying new restaurants every Saturday.  Today we went to Rita 's. The waitress Eva was totally awesome and very attentive to our table.  Many others came by to make sure we had all we needed.  The food was great and I would go back in a heartbeat.  Thanks again Eva for the best service see you again definitely!!"}
{"text":"On this, my 4th time dining at Rita's, I'm having my first meal of the day after 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon.  I have a breakfast-specific coupon and having not eaten yet at this late hour, called to confirm that  the breakfast dishes are served all day long, so figured \"why not\".  The dining room was an oasis of cool comfort on yet another blisteringly hot summer day.  In the cool quiet of the nicely appointed dining room you would not even be aware that you're practically sitting on top of the 10.    My initial server took my order promptly but returned to inform me my first choice was unavailable, but this turned out to be a good thing as my substitute Huevos con nopales (scrambled eggs with vegetables, including nopales/cactus, house potatoes and tortilla, were absolutely excellent, and of generous portion too.  Service was polite as always, though somewhat absentee, as they clearly had more business than they were prepared for at mid-afternoon.   It was a good thing I and other would-be diners were apparently not in a hurry.  Customers looked to each other in helpless amusement as we waited and waited and waited for our server, any server, to come by.  As one hurriedly passed near me, oblivious to or ignoring one LONG waiting young man on other side of restaurant who had tried repeatedly to flag down a passing any employee passing by for quite some time, I asked the harried server to please help that customer, who came up and thanked me for my assistance and joked good-naturedly about our respective long waits.  Finally, though I'd just had breakfast, it was by now 4:30 p.m. and my heart, mouth, and mind were fixated on having a flan, but alas they were out of that too, so  I settled for sopapilla,  a honey drizzled puff pastry, but it was a hollow (pun intended) substitute for the excellent flan I'd had there before.    While it wasn't a highlight day for Rita's usual level of service, once again the food was excellent, and I still look forward to going back for more.  4 or more for the food, and I'm going to leave it there, regarding today as an aberration in customary quality of service."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, I would definately recommend this place. The food is very flavorful, good authentic Mexican sea food."}
{"text":"Great place for drink with chips and salsa. The food is a bit mediocre. Tried their soups, and was not happy or pleased with them. Not my first choice for Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now because we enjoyed it so much the first time and I honestly can't wait to go back. Location is not great and even living in the area for years never though of trying it but glad I did. The waiter was quite talkative but he really made the experience fun. He had recommendations from the menu and we ended up ordering the red chili Colorado which was defiantly one to go back for! We also tried the fajitas which were great and my son tore up his chicken taco plate and he isn't much of a Mexican food type of person. Defiantly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Gabriella was so kind! She waited us and made sure that we had everything that we needed. We were first time visitors and the food was delicious. Will definitely visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Ritas to wait out traffic and had a pitcher of Margaritas and side table guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. Our server was Michelle and she was spectacular kept checking to make sure we were ok!  We love this place and our server made it great. Thanks Michelle"}
{"text":"My stop here was due to Yelping a Mexican restaurant in the area. Thank goodness for Yelp as they saved my day. My lunch with co-workers was one of the best. Not one of us had one complaint. Everything not only taste great but the service was up to par.   This restaurant is right on the corner near (I10) freeway. A nice mom and pop type of place with a family feel. The variety of Mexican food to choose from gives everyone at the table an opportunity to choose what they really like. The hardest part is to figure out what you want. All of us chose something different. I hot and steamy steak fajitas. My mouth is watering just writing this. The fajitas were amazing. So was my rice which I am very picky about. There rice taste fresh not from the box. The chips and salsa are good too. They serve the chips warm.   The venue is decorated authentic with a little history. The staff is down to earth. A must try for my Yelp following. I know your friends and family will be impressed. As my co-workers were giving me kudos for finding a new great place to eat."}
{"text":"Good salsa, huge salads, friendly service. I always go there for dinner but I'm hoping to get in to try their chilaquiles for breakfast."}
{"text":"Might not be best area but the food and drinks were great. Friendly staff! If you go save room for fried ice cream. Delicious. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"My friend had been here several times and took me today for lunch. Our server Armando was amazing. He was gentle non-intrusive and very attentive. Ask for Armando if you go there even though the whole wait staff seemed very friendly. The food was amazing and fresh and very prompt. It's probably the best Mexican food I've had here in Arizona since I've been here for 10 years. I will definitely be coming back and can't wait to check out their breakfast. Bravo!! Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"First time here was exceptional. service was great ! ARMANDO was the BEST!  For appetizers we had the shrimp toritos. Bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with shrimp..Bomb!!  for the entree I had Cali chipotle  Shrimp, which was different and tasted so great. My plate had a side of rice and beans (both were super enjoyable!) I had such a great time that me and my bf decided to return...  Second time... We ordered the same appetizers, which in my book were still AMAZING! but the shrimp diablo plate was eh-- It was not spicy and bland. The waitress who assisted us, was not very attentive and would forget to fill up our drinks. I couldn't help but to compare her to our previous waiter Armando, who was beyond exceptional..  Bottom line is... I will not return unless Armando is working"}
{"text":"This was a nice little find - came in for lunch mid afternoon and although it was quiet, we received great service and a great lunch.  We had tacos and fajitas - all pretty damn solid for sure.  The chips and salsa are worth the trip alone in my humble opinion.    Great food, great service - it's bookmarked!   Muy Bien!"}
{"text":"Best red and green chili burros in town! Friendly service and authentic  food. Check it out!  also, to get a 2 dollar plate of fried ice cream with flan and a deep fried shell is awesome, can't think of a better desert for the cost in the valley!"}
{"text":"Extremely delish authentic Mexican food. Saturday evening around 5ish and wasn't that busy. When we got there waited just a tad to be seated but then were taken care of right away. Waitress was very nice and explained anything we didn't quite understand. Overall great food and experience"}
{"text":"Michelle was absolutely fantastic, the food was great and wonderful atmosphere.   Will definitely come back when back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A little greesy but pretty good. I was a little upset with the waitress because we asked her how big the serving size was for a large menudo and she made it seem like it was on the smaller side. When the bowl arrived it was big enough to feed at least 2 people. The food came to us cold."}
{"text":"So I went with my Mom and expected great service and Food. We ordered two small bowls of Menudo with a side of toasted bread. Once we had received our Menudo, it tasted very bland even with the Cilantro and onions. The bread didn't even taste fresh. The tripe was cut in large chunks and had a weird after taste. This was my first time back in a long time. My mom and I will never return. The server took a long time to serve our drinks and food. Perhaps our Menudo was frozen and quickly thawed out because it also had a old taste to it. Next time around I'll save myself money and time by buying canned Menudo from Food City and chopping my own condiments. My ice tea didn't even taste like ice tea."}
{"text":"I had only ever eaten breakfast at Rita's until my recent visit. My husband and I went for lunch and it was PHENOMENAL. It was fresh, hot, and came with unlimited baskets of chips and salsa (our favorite)! Our waiter was one of the best representatives of customer satisfaction and service that we have probably ever seen at a Mexican food restaurant. I truly wish I could remember his name, but he was the only young, confident, and respectful Latino waiter in the entire place, so if you ever get him- he will surely stand out based on his attentiveness and professionalism. I am pretty certain that his name was Alex! Thanks for having such great food and for having Alex on your team!"}
{"text":"I come here frequently, I am usually impressed, but I was disappointed with there salsa. It was kind of watery. It's like they needed to stretch it."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant before a concert at Ak-Chin last night. The positives include friendly service, clean restaurant and lots of pictures of my favorite Frida Kahlo.   The food was okay. I had two ala carte tacos and the carne asada had way way too much sauce and way too many red peppers. The menu didn't explain this. I also had the steak taco and it was buried in onions and I don't like onions; again the menu didn't describe this. Others had the shrimp salad, tacos and chili rellenos.  All gave it a 3 Star. I'm going to try other Mexican restaurants next time we go to a concert."}
{"text":"This was a last minute find.  We were headed home to Goodyear when the traffic took a turn for the worst (it was close to 6 pm).  So I hop on google maps and find Rita's where we decide to pull off and grab a bite.  It was a great experience!  The area is a little off-setting.  But once inside it truly is the cutest little restaurant.  Our server was so sweet and helpful and attentive.  Great happy hour margaritas!  All the food ordered tasted great.  LOVED the salsa!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Probably one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area, the food is just very authentic. The atmosphere is super cozy, it almost makes you feels like you are in Mexico. Love this place"}
{"text":"First time here. I have passed this restaurant for years now and I have never ate here. I decides to try it last year after buying a groupon. My groupon expires today just in time before my brothers birthday. Now I have to say it is a nice little cozy place nestled on a corner close to the freeway. Parking is limited. There is a line of spaces in the back of building maybe holds a good to 12 cars against a 3 ft brick wall right by the alley. Don't let the location chase you away.  The building itself is cute lined with arched beautiful windows. When you walk in you can seat yourself someone will come to you and take your order.  The inside is nicely decorated with typical Mexican decor Pancho Villa pictures and all. Not overly done but tastefully done. You will be served fresh hot chips with mmm mmm salsa. I bit spicy maybe for the weak but still full of flavor. We had an excellent waitress and she made sure our basket and salsa was always full along with our drinks. Water is not tap lol so that was nice I was a bit thirsty so didn't mind the refills. We ordered the platter with seafood for 2 you get a salad Mexican potatoes and rice. The platter was abundant with several tasty items sea bass grilled and breaded. Shrimp grilled AND lightly breaded and bacon wrapped and to top off a lobster tail. It truly was alot we definitely could not finish. If you ever are in the area and would like some authentic Mexican dishes stop by Rita's.  The menu will not disappoint anyone there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"My hubby works out on the west side so he will occasionally drag the whole family to some resturaunt he has decided is well worth the trek. Rita's is one of our go to's for completely authentic Mexican.  Rita herself is a classy business saavy gal from south of the border who knows her stuff and is a sweetheart to her patrons.  The food is muy muy bien.  Si es possible, triega una persona que habla espanol.   Or you can just point to the number on the menu.  Up to you."}
{"text":"Rita's offers some great menu choices. Menudo is not one of them.  But seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem. Oh, they don't serve Coke products either.   Being a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe.  The broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird. The tripe is overcooked and flubbery.  Overall, it's pretty disgusting.  So if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it.  Instead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito.  Try their chips and salsa too.  Four stars for the server's gigantic hangers.  Overall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls."}
{"text":"From Mesa to Tolleson this is by far the best most Authentic Mexican food in all of the greater Phoenix area. They have excellent service, and the food comes out fresh in a very timely manner. Great if you are on a lunch break and time is an issue. Chips and salsa come complimentary, very good salsa. I usually order chile relleno which is great, but I also like the carnitas and the combo platters they offer. It is a smaller restaurant but that is what makes it nice and homely. Anybody looking for great Mexican food should give this place a try. I still haven't tried a lot of the mariscos but have seen the dishes served and they look fantastic."}
{"text":"Posole is authentic and delicious. Margaritas by aaron are fantastic. Bacon wrapped peppers with shrimp are to die for. This place is worth driving to no matter the distance."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems that you'll want to take out-of-town guests to. It's located just off of the I-10, next to a tire shop, but when you step inside, you're transported to your favorite restaurant in Rocky Point. They have an extensive menu of REALLY good food and they'll let you order off the breakfast menu all day.   :)  This is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant!"}
{"text":"So we were on yet another hunt for some fabulous  Mexican food and Found it! chips and salsa were fresh, the frozen mags were good.  I had the steak fajitas and wow I was in heaven!   The veggies were cooked and seasoned to perfection and the steak was mouth watering and tortillas hot and fresh.  And the serving size is huge!  Yum I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yum, I definitely recommend the Taritos, which at this place are green peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon - amazing. The carne asada was nice as well, but the service is a bit slow. Very authentic."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I was taken here. It's a hidden gem. The fajitas were outstanding and the lunch portions very generous. The staff were friendly and helpful - I'm certainly planning on going again. The only reason this review isn't a 5 star is that it's based upon one visit - I like to see consistency before awarding 5."}
{"text":"Went to ths place after getting a groupon and looked like a good deal .  Atmosphere was nice, located in a rundown area.   Food was ok, but there popular steak meat platter is full of dried out, overcooked steak, salsa was good and chips were average.  A big turnoff for me was the waiter trying to upsell everything and trying to get us to buy the most expensive dish. To me it felt like a used car salesmen but it came across fake rather then friendly.  My biggest complaint is we had a groupon for $30 and he would only let us use 27 of it!   The total bill was 33.96 , but he didn't like us using groupon so made up An excuse for not taking it all.   Overall, fair food, poor service, much better options out there."}
{"text":"This restaurant  has the most amazing guacamole we have ever had. It is made fresh at table side and you can custom it according to your taste. Every dish we have ever eaten there  tasted fresh, hot  and delicious.  I highly recommend  this place for their food.  The only reason I did not give it another star was  because of ambiance. The decor us tired and cramped at times."}
{"text":"There is too much to say but I am so full I have to take a nap this place was great service cute sweet waitresses food was plentiful servings are large u get more than what u pay for on quality and quantity I'm a truck driver so I see a lot of restaurants and I have had 1 other restaurant that was this good and it was on the border of Texas and I could walk behind the restaurant and be in Mexico and this has to be my number 2 spot. My final words are DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP TRY IT EAT AND U WILL LOVE IT"}
{"text":"One of best Mexican restaurant in the valley. Very low key but delicious. Love their homemade salsa and crunchy & hot piping chips as well as all their tacos (machaca, carnitas and lengua). Another favorite I love to get also is the cocido de res soup."}
{"text":"The service was good....the enchiladas were good...the chips and salsa were great....the 'hood is a little sketchy, so go for lunch. I wish I had time to have one of their margaritas because I hear they are good. I enjoyed my dinner though :-)"}
{"text":"We found Rita's via yelp while trying to meet friends passing through Phoenix heading West on I-10 from I-17. We are from Ahwatukee and it was 100% worth the drive! The staff was wonderful, polite and efficient.  The food was amazing! So much flavor and the portions were just right.  We plan to visit Rita's again, despite the drive we will find time to go."}
{"text":"A quaint little house style restaurant,family owned.The food is amazing and so much food you would not want to leave without it."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great service.Guacamole made table side. Best guacamole ever!!  They had a seafood platter that was amazing!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time going to this place for lunch and will never go back. Food was just ok, 1 star for service. A/C was blowing Arctic air in our face and making our food cold, we asked 3 times before they finally turned off the air * Buyer Beware* bought a Groupon and they would not honor it because the waitress said it was for dinner service only. Nowhere on the Groupon does it specify \"dinner only\". The waitress kept saying no to the Groupon until she finally asked the owner. By that time I was upset and just wanted to get out of there. The owner said only 1 Groupon per table. The dollar amount doesn't matter. It was the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Their seafood enchiladas were amazing! And that pomegranate margarita was great. Aaron was our waiter. He didn't want me to use my Groupon at first.  Yea right! I found this place driving and found a deal. Now i have to find a place in LA for a replica of those enchiladas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! At a location I wouldn't really think of going. But this place is definitely worth coming back to even without Groupon.  My friend and I loved every dish we had. The bacon wrapped chili was actually stuffed with 2shrimp as well!  Everything was great! From the staff, the service, and the atmosphere, but the food speaks for itself. Amazing! Can't wait to go back and try more. It does cost a little more than those chain 'bertos' places. But you have to pay a few extra dollars for delicious food. Don't be afraid to just close you eyes and pick something in the menu.  Next time I will try and ask to have my seafood deveined.  Their salsa also amazed me. Tasted homemade and authentic.  Met the owner during dinner and made our experience even better! A great guy! Very attentive and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Update: the owner did write to me saying they will work on getting their takeout orders correct. I appreciate a business willing to improve."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Had a great experience overall. Great service and great food! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Service Armando is the man.. Did such a great job... Food was equisite seafood enchiladas are so cheesy and compacted with shrimp. The Baja California has Chipotle shrimp rice papas and a very refreshing salad. But can you say you had me at hello?.. Because you did the friendly atmosphere and music along with free chips and salsa I was ready to commit"}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if the salsa could be hotter. Server, Cynthia was top notch. The menudo was very good with perfectly cooked hominy. Not too soft and not undercooked either! Just delicious. Broth had good flavor. Chunks of tripe well cleaned and not fatty-perfect. Husband had tacos and refried beans, also good. Perhaps a bit more Meat in it would have made it better. All in all-time really good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Did the Cinco de Mayo thing for lunch on Friday with some friends. Chips n salsa were great. Food was very good and fresh. Couldn't sample the margarita selections, had to go back to work, so ice tea was the drink of choice for lunch."}
{"text":"No thank you for responding. I know you might have great tasting food but unfortunately that wasn't the case when I was there. It was a little to salty and about the staff I would of appreciated if they came back asking if everything was ok, but they didn't. I was actually excited to go there due to the some good reviews on your restaurant but I wished it was a little more pleasant and employees more excited to work there. I would of asked for something else but due to the lack in timing of the waitress I was to hungry to even wait. Hopefully you continue making changes and it all works out."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant just off the interstate which is convenient. Hubby had the poblano relleno. It looked beautiful and tasted amazing. I've had many rellenos, some good, some not so good. This one is the best ever. I had tacos. Shrimp was good, shredded beef was blah--no flavor. Chips were ok but some had a bit of an off taste, possibly a little stale. Salsa was good. We'll be back. Be choosy about what you order as there's average and then there's out of this world good here!"}
{"text":"I relied on the Yelp reviews to find a good Mexican restaurant in a certain vicinity, and Rita's Mexican Food was the choice. Seeing they take reservations, I made one since it was a Saturday night, and we were planning on dining at 6:30.  I was surprised to see the place empty, except for a couple tables, and wondered if Yelp had let me down. Nope! It started with the friendly wait staff. She was very nice and checked with us often, but not too often, to make sure we were ok. The Sangria and strawberry margarita were very good. My Parrillada Del Rancho dinner included a thin slice of steak, chicken, and pork chop. All 3 meats were a slightly overdone, maybe from the grill or the \"cooker\" it was presented on at the table. But tasty, none the less. The other 3 meals were said to be very good, too. Oh, and the guacamole was freshly made at the table, and also very good.  4 dinners, 2 alcohol drinks, guacamole appetizer, and a a fried ice cream came to $132."}
{"text":"We ordered margaritas, fresh guacamole, abondigas soup, salad, fajitas, and fried ice cream. Everything was so delicious and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. The waitress was very nice and did a great job. I will definitely come back when I'm back in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. The people are nice the food is great. If you want to eat some good Mexican food this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic - quality ingredients , not the boring tacos and burritos the molchajete Azteca was amazing!! service is friendly and attentive - Gabby made us feel so welcome - highly recommend."}
{"text":"I only have one thing to say. Anglo Cheeze Whiz style cheese \"sauce\" instead of cheese. Gross."}
{"text":"First time at Rita's , and on top of the food being very authentic we had great service from Alex ! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Such a great meal! We bought a groupon and went on the same day. Being the foodies we are, we bought the Groupon for $50 worth of food and ordered up a ton of it. For apps, we had the guacamole and seafood cocktail (be warned, there was raw shrimp and scallops, mixed in with the cooked seafood) for $18.50. It had a lot of seafood: shrimp, scallops, and octopus. They did not skimp on the tableside  guacamole either. So good.   For dinner, I had the bacon wrapped shrimp with rice and salad on the side. I didn't eat the salad, but the shrimp and rice were delicious. My husband got a mixed grill plate he thoroughly enjoyed. Total bill for two dinners, soda, and apps, was $55 and we had a substantial amount of leftovers.   Service was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and moderately priced. The drinks were cold and very good. I have high expectations for Mexican food in the southwest and they were totally me here. All four of us left full and happy, and the waitstaff was very accommodating."}
{"text":"My family and I visit this restaurant often. Today at lunch we stopped by and both my wife and I had the poblano lunch meal. We asked the waitress to make it stuffed with shredded beef instead of chicken and had some attitude about the substitution from the staff... They did make it as we asked but we were not convinced it was done with our satisfaction or health in mind. I believe they were irritated by our request and may have done something to the meal... Like under cook it or add expired (old) ingredients. It was all we had eaten today and are having stomach pains and digestive problems... Going #3 if you get my drift. My wifey more than I. We are heading to urgent care ... Not happy, we are hispanic and do not have ibs or lack of tolerance for mex... We'll see whats up at the ER...."}
{"text":"Amazing enchiladas! Fantastic atmosphere with great music and our waitress, Eva, was hilarious! The margaritas were SO GOOD. I would highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Lupita's was our server she is wonderful really friendly food tasted delish. Defenderlo coming back ."}
{"text":"First visit ever, due to a Groupon deal. Was not disappointed. Great food, love the ambiance, great service by the waitresses. They checked back often, and if I wanted more chips and salsa. I had shrimp ceviche, seven seas soup, and heuvos con chorizo. It was all delicious!   Prices were reasonable and serving sizes generous.  Wooden booths, wooden tables and chairs, Spanish music, quick service, sufficient parking. Coming off the I-10, you have to go north then find a turn around point. The atmosphere was nice. Some old objects on walls for ambiance. Plenty of seating. No wait on Saturday. It looks deceiving on the outside, I wasn't sure they were open, but I was there around 6pm.   I'll be returning for sure. Thanks for a great first experience everyone there!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! We had the Ritas Parilla. Service was good. Fresh and beautiful good. Great music and authentic."}
{"text":"We had never been here, always pass it on our way home. Read the reviews decided to try it out. I honestly don't understand why some of the reviews talked about the staff being rude etc... We didn't find that at all. Our waitress was actually nice and checked in on us frequently. Even the gentleman who sat us was polite. My son actually dumped his drink all over and I felt horrible, I was rather shocked how fast a clean up crew arrived and I mean crew 3 of them, even moved us to another table which was nice. The prices are a little higher than other places... The food was good nothing that really stood out good or bad. We didn't really order anything out of the ordinary I had fajitas, the hubs had chili colorado... Kid bean burrito. I wouldn't say I'd never go back but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"The food & service was good. We had Aaron  he was awesome :) I recommend you try the toritos"}
