{"text":"This place is excellent. The only mystery is why people are not lined up to  get into it. The food is always fresh and service is great. Certainly one of the best sushi places  in Leaside"}
{"text":"My workplace is right next to Mong Sushi. I finally decided to give them a try after eating at other sushi places around the area (Maki Sushi, and one on Bayview). Ordered a Spicy Crab Pizza and it was pretty tasty and filling! Very quick and friendly service.

Look it wasn't really spicy nor did it have real crab (obviously). My other friend ordered a lunch special. Do you get a lot for the price you pay? Comparing it to Maki Sushi, not that much. Sometimes, it's about quality and not quantity. I'll try a lunch special next time!"}
{"text":"This location has change its name and is now Han Sushi.  Probably new management."}
{"text":"Just had a lovely lunch here for the first time.

It's nothing out of the ordinary to look at, and the menu seems quite standard, but the food is delicious!

The salmon maki were very good, but the yakitori were the very best I've ever had -- served sizzling hot and delicious.  The staff were very helpful and friendly -- I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Back again to Mong and ordered the same Sushi Lunch Bento Box ($12.95) 

Just comparing the photos I took last time to what I had this afternoon, I have to say I am just pleasantly surprised!

The quality and quantity of the food both improved since my last visit. The shari rice still one of the best one I had and I can just taste the chef put special care in the preparation of the food he serves!

Complimentary Green Tea Ice Cream to finish off my lunch...

I left happy and full!"}
