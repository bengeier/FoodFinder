{"text":"Came for the beer, which I love. Stayed for the food, which was amazing!! Friendliest service in town. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Amazing new place in Leslieville. 

Finally a restaurant that is focused on great beer and food that is not trying to be a dark hipster joint. 

Jerk wings were just the perfect amount of spice and very good flavor. 

Charcuterie board was delicious with deep fried olives...Homemade spicy mustard was so good!

The homemade warm spicy nuts...heaven

We then order the gnocchi...so fresh. Loved that it was not cream based sauce and the mix of the corn and mushrooms was a great idea. 

\"Best napkins in the city!\""}
{"text":"Cute little bar/brewery. Very open concept you can see into the kitchen. There are few tables mostly accommodating 2-4 people but migt be able to do up to 6. The bar stools looked super comfy.

Beer selection included a variety of styles; Belgian, pale ale, ipa and stout. These git a offer flights which include your choice of 4 beers on the menue (taste size)  

The service was friendly. 

Overall its pretty good Toronto craft beer.

There was also a food menu which we did not take advantage of this time"}
{"text":"Love this brewery! It's a bit of a trek to get to, but so worth it. A cozy place with low lighting, it has both table and bar seating. Not great for large groups because it gets pretty busy and it's not a large space. 

Service is great. They truly love what they do. When I asked questions, our beer slinger told me his opinion as well as what customers thought. Great snacks too. The hummus platter is very out of proportion....TONS of hummus! Beers are pretty good as well!

I look forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Good choices for food and beer.  The food took SO LONG TO COME OUT.  We were starving.  I don't know if this is a ploy to get you to order more beer, but we had to slow our drinking to wait for the food.  The food was really good (I think. sometimes when you're that hungry, ALL food tastes good).  The pork quesadilla was steaming hot.  The pretzel was good, the side mustard clearly trumping the cheesy sauce.  The beer was good, service friendly.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"We LOVED the beers here....Yuzu (my fav), Midnight Oil (dark and rich), Slingshot (available at the LCBO along with Yuzu) and Double Speak in my flight. The food was solid. We started with the kettle chips, and had the chicken dumplings and BBQ braised beef for our mains. Everything was very good. Not crazy gourmet, but solid comfort food perfect with the beers. It is not a large space, and the vibe and service are laid back and comfortable. We really enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"For now a mini-review. We had a Radical Road IPA at The Local that we really liked a month or so ago and since then we have been curious about visiting. It was a hot afternoon and we cycled over to check it out. The place is a cute classic bar but we sat outside in the heat. There are just a few seats squeezed onto the sidewalk out front but it's a nice spot to soak up the street scene. 

We revisited the IPA and had another style (which I cannot remember right now). It was a quick visit and we were soon hydrated and off to continue our ride. Looking forward to a return visit and enjoying the interior."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come to this new entrant into the neighbourhood for a long while now.  I am really glad I made the short walk out on the cold night into the welcome arms of some delicious alcoholic beverages.

While browsing through their menu was the yuzu pale ale drew my attention and away I went with my first pint at Radical Road.  I found it really refreshing and the yuzu flavour was very mild.  Would be perfect on a hot summer's day.  I also really liked their Slingshot too.  It's easy to drink and quite tasty.

The place is small and intimate with only a handful of tables but there is adequate space at the bar to hang and chill.  They have some artwork hanging on the walls but the vibe just resonates laid back chill.  There was a very happy buzz of people enjoying what Radical Road has to offer.

I didn't get a chance to try the menu as the kitchen was closed when we arrived around 10:30PM that night.

I can see this as a very nice regular drop-in spot with a few friends and look forward to a return visit. :-)"}
{"text":"I stopped into Radical Road impulsively when in the east end and I'm glad I did! Previously, I had only really been introduced to their Yuzu Pale Ale which is available in some LCBO's, and admittedly I wasn't the hugest fan of it. However upon visiting their tap room, I'm much more impressed with things. 

In fact, despite hitting a few East end breweries during the day, this was my favourite stop. The tap room is cozy and laid back. Bartender was friendly, and a Weezer megamix on the house stereo was a nice bonus.

Beer wise, they had about 6 beers on tap (oddly enough, not including the aforementioned Yuzu), hitting a variety of styles and they were all pretty darn tasty and easy drinking. 
Specifically, their Key Lime Gose was incredible! Salty and sour like a good gose should be, but the lime notes really rounded it out wonderfully. My only disappointment was in not being able to take any to go with me, but that's Ontario's bottle shop laws not being allowed to sell beer after 11pm that hurt me there, nothing per Radical Roads doing.

A fully recommendable stop for any east end beer explorers!"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with a couple friends, before The Hip finale.

Pints are $6 a glass, flight of 3 cost $9.

Two of us opted for the flight.  Beers were great!  Unfortunately the Yuzu barrel was dry, so I'll definitely have to try it next time.  While enjoying our flight we also had an order of their home made potato chips ($5).  Nice and crunchy with a slight seasoning.  Great match for the beers.

All 3 of us ordered the BBQ braised beef ($19).  It fell apart with a fork and was delicious.  The beef sat atop a bed of mac n cheese, which was creamy smooth and cheesy.  Also on the plate were some greens to balance out the plate.  Oh, and a home made cornbread muffin.

Finished off with some peach cobbler served in a jam jar($7). Big slices of caramelized peaches with a crunchy crumble and fresh whipped cream.  It was devine!

It's a small joint with only 4-5 tables and room for 5-6 at the bar.  They'll definitely need more space to grow! Service was also fantastic!  Friendly and attentive.

Great addition to Leslieville!"}
{"text":"Visited Radical Road on Saturday Oct 31 around 7:30. The atmosphere was great and so was the d√©cor, simple but tastefully done.  I heard a lot about the braised beef dish so this is the dish I had in mind however they ran out!  What a huge disappointment that was!!  Ended up with the chicken  which was fine but really not what I had in mind.  Personally would have prefers a warm potato side instead of cold potatoes but it could be me looking for comfort food going into a long winter. 

After having ran out of the beef they also ran out of some of the beers.  There are no words to express how I felt about that!  The staff was unsure of what to say about that second incident but he was a trooper

I will check this place out again but with no expectations this time around and hopefully they will hit it out of the park this next time."}
{"text":"Hereabouts is a Queen East storefront microbrewery way close to home. The pub itself has a great classy intimate neighbourhood vibe, and the service even more so great. It practically feels like a tight living room. They squeezed in a tiny street patio, and there's hardly much room for a big party with only a couple tables, but the bar's really where you want to be. You can't really see the in-house brewing operations which is buried behind the kitchen and also a windowed room downstairs (I believe the bulk of their operations is off-site tho), but wait until you open your mouth.

They have a full stocked bar, though you're likely here for their own suds, right? Besides their crispy signature SlingShot (available in cans at many LCBOs) and the interesting and highly recommended-by-me, amazing Yuzu PA (punchy citrusy flavour made with imported Japanese yuzu juice; also available canned at many LCBOs), they have a constantly rotating lineup of other tasty interesting, out-of-this-world in-house products on tap. They offer tasting flights of any 4 beers for something like I think, $10 or $12?

Food-wise, the brewpub has a tiny menu of fine cooked grub that seems to change often. Someone beside me had a massive Shepard's pie that smelled amazing, but I simply snacked on the kettle chips ($5) with my many beers, and those were a fistful of well-seasoned fried yum.

If all you want is drinks to take home, the \"bottle shop\" is really just a vintage fridge right next to the window. 8-Track IPA in stubbies--we go way back.

[TTC: Jones bus or 501/2/3 it to Queen/Jones]"}
{"text":"Beers and sharable bites from a microbrewery - satisfies all the requirements to be in Leslieville. Walking in, it's an inviting bar with their brewery in the back. They have seasonal beers and as soon as I saw cucumber mint I was sold. Came here on a Saturday afternoon with my partner, looking for something casual. There was sprobably only another party in the place, with some families outside on the small patio out front. 

Beer Flights ($10-12): Slingshot, St Augustine, Shoreline, and Cucumber Mint. Strong ales are my favourite, having more of a punch to really get my night started. The Cucumber Mint was super refreshing and you can really taste the crispness in the drink.


Mini Smoked Salmon and Salt Cod Cakes ($16): Decent, crispy fish cakes with a light cream beneath. Personally, it wasn't worth it for the price of 6 small coin-sized pieces and it was pretty flavour less. This is where they lose the stars for me. 

The service was great - super helpful and nice even when they did forget our water (small little detail though!)."}
{"text":"Great decor, and something coming out of the kitchen. Unfortunately we weren't there for food.  Picked up 2 types of beer to try and chatted with the waiter.

Would I return? Yes
Would I recommend?  Yes"}
{"text":"Came in from LA and a few locals recommend this place. Food was amazing and tasted homemade fresh. To drink the husband and I tried the Pommes Cider and Cucumber Mint Kolsch. Very mild and tasty. Also tried the Caribbean Curried Vegetable Roti and Spicy Pan Fried Squid. Very good!"}
{"text":"I've only had the beers and the Yuzu and the 8 track are a must have.  I've looked over the menu and it looks great as well.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went here with a groupon that included a couple of flights (choice of 4 small beers) and a tour. Owner was super friendly and showed us the process.

All the beers were excellent and quite varied. We really liked the slingshot, which we were told you can get at many LCBO's.

We also ordered the pretzel which was fantastic. Came with a couple delicious dipping sauces (one dijon-based the other cheese-based). Really hit the spot with the beers.

The service was excellent overall to and the place has a nice vibe.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They have completely nailed all elements. The atmosphere was lively considering the small size with not an empty seat in the house.

It was probably the best beer, averaged across all types, that I've had at any microbrew restaurant and I've tried more than I'm proud of. The saison was incredible.

Don't let the small kitchen fool you, the food was also great. It's not an extensive menu but everything on it sounds good from lamb ribs to braised beef. I had the braised beef and it was a very tender large boneless piece served over some very cheesy Mac & cheese and with a side of some delicious sauteed leafy green. It was a lot of value for $19.

Seating could be tough if you're with a large party but we were good with 4.

I highly recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely bunch - especially Maggie. Very nice, comfortable brewpub in Leslieville, without attitude and amazing chips.  All their beers are great, but the chocolate oatmeal stout is wonderful.  Best addition to the neighborhood.  We're a lucky bunch, in the east end, to have Radical Road"}
{"text":"Small cozy place, great service - waitress Julie was super nice to us - organized the table for 6 + small baby in a car seat. BBQ braised beef was super juicy and double speak belgian IPA was hoppy enough! Too bad they didn't have that IPA to go, but slingshots talls were quite a descent substitute"}
{"text":"Small but seemingly popular brewpub. We were looking forward to trying this place, but left somewhat disappointed.

It's very dark inside, and the service leaves something to be desired.

Beers were a bit overpriced and unimpressive. We did not try the food here..."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a pint and a pretzel. I tried the sampler flight of three beers. They were all pretty yummy. The pretzel was a wee bit dry, but the two dips were decent. The place itself is cute and our server was really nice. I would come back!"}
{"text":"We came into this place yesterday with a large group and pretty much tried everything on the beer and food menu. Amazing! Leslieville is lucky to have such a sweet little spot open up that serves great beer and food. 

It's a little tight for space so you might not get a table right away but that just shows you how well they are doing and for good reason. 

My only complaint is I wish the wings were slightly bigger and crispier because they are so good I could three orders to myself.

Service was awesome and the owners are solid people!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The beer was delicious, and I'll be back to have a flight next time. The food was tasty and the staff were warm and attentive which was excellent especially given how busy the place was. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Small craft brewery/bar in Leslieville (I think that's the neighbourhood) that serves a limited menu and a tiny list of good beers.

I had the St. Arnold (Blond) and the 1847 (Red).  Add a Brunette and it would have been interesting...   :))

The server was quick, I swear that she was psychic and pre-poured our beer and had it behind her back as we ordered.  No sooner did I say the beer did a finely poured amber nectar in a glass show up in front of me - better a bottle in front of me than the frontal lobotomy!

Snacked on the kettle chips and a hot pretzel...yummmmm!

The bar itself has limited seating at the bar and a few tables.  A nice neighbourhood hangout and it would be a RAD place to hang out and become the NORM there...!  Figure that one out.

Cheers!"}
