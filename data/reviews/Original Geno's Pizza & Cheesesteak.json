{"text":"Ordered lunch for delivery today (4 separate orders) Brittany who took my orders was friendly and professional the delivery guy was awesome.  Food is great! Can not beat the price and they deliver double thumbs up in our office.  Meatball sub yummy and I asked for well done fries, they were perfect!!!  Others in the office have asked us for # and menu.  Love finding a good place for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came to the original Genos all the way from Gilbert, what a difference in the food from the Gilbert and queen creek locations. Copycats can't do it like theses guys, had the burger today and it was deff the best burger ever, bacon cheddar burger try it, if I could give these guys a 10 star I would. If you try Genos come to Tempe open till 4 am. My new late night spot. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Ive always loved this place,\" but ive always went inside. Every time I went inside it was pretty good service. No complaints. I try calling one time and its awful service. The food is 4/5, no real complaints. Overall I don't have good service"}
{"text":"I just moved here from San Francisco and i wanted to pick up a quick salad and pizza to have as i relaxed and got settled in. I ordered a chicken fajita salad , and a cheesesteak which by far exceeded my expectations!! Its was so delicious!!!! What will make me come back to this location is their friendly management, especially Mike!! Thank you for a good experience ."}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend after the gym and were ready to chow down. Had the turkey sub and mozzarella sticks. Good flavor and spices although the marinara would be better warm and the stick more fried to get that gooey cheese inside. His buffalo fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food good prices!!!! We'll be going back for more lol had a philly cheese and some pizza was pretty good and for the price was great"}
{"text":"Worst experience at Genos. Will not be ordering from them again.  Order was incorrect, late and cold and the refused to refund me. They said  it was some how our fault we didn't receive the correct order.  DO NOT USE THIS BUSINESS"}
{"text":"Cheese Steak was bland, cold hoagie roll, no seasoning for the steak.  Wings hot, fresh, and delicious.  Raspberry iced tea nowhere near par.  Customer service a little lacking; we were not greeted with enthusiasm as to be expected. Will not be returning as the prices were too high, $10 for a footlong sandwich.  At those prices, I expected more flavor."}
{"text":"We usually have good luck finding great food but were seriously wrong tonight. The food was warm since it was 30+ minutes late. The delivery person sounded like a dingbat when they called 20 minutes late to find out where we were at after ample directions were put in. We've had delivery with the same directions and no problems thusfar. The best thing was the mushrooms but they were on the warm side even. Horribly disappointing."}
{"text":"Entire order was 45 minutes late and ice cold. I've tried time and time again to order from them but they fail every time. Would never recommend."}
{"text":"My kids and I live across the street from Geno's and were excited to go after they opened.  Our first visit was ok. Staff was nice.  Food mediocre.  Restaurant clean.  We went back for our second visit about 6 weeks later.  We ordered a Greek salad,  Greek fries,  3 slices,  a burger, a cheesesteak, and mozzarella sticks.  The salad was served almost immediately.  Then the wait began.  For 30 minutes we sat and watched as the staff cut lettuce, drank soda and joked around. We finally get the pizza.  3 slices that had very obviously been sitting for hours. To spruce them up the \"cook\" sprinkled a few strands of fresher cheese over top and reheated. The slices were so thin and wet..wet! You couldn't even pick it up. The cheese sticks were next. They were piping hot.. with frozen marinara. Actually frozen. I asked if there was any warm sauce and was told no. In a pizza place. The cheesesteak and Greek fries were next. Greasy yet dry, at the same time. Stale roll. My daughter had to drench it in ketchup to get down a few bites . the fries were \"baked\".. they were dry, rock hard and stuck to their baking pan. Almost no toppings that make them \"Greek\".  After, another 15 minutes the burger came out but sat behind the counter until my 16 year old got up and asked for her sister's food. My son and I couldn't eat the pizza. I went up to the counter.  I told the cashier that the pizza was very disgusting, obviously old and that I wanted a refund.  She acted like I raped her favorite stuffed animal. She disappeared, and came back almost 10 minutes later offering, not a refund but a free pizza. We took the pizza and my kids said school pizza is better. School pizza!!!!! If the HORRIBLE crap they call food isn't enough of a reason to deter you from eating at Geno's,  perhaps the hour+ wait, and careless staff will."}
{"text":"Jersey girl here! That being said,  I know my cheesesteaks baby! Italian families love food. I grew up eating and appreciating food at a young age. This was an appreciation that I now have ten times over Bc let's face it,  there's no food like east coast food and cheesesteaks are a staple.  Genos is a real philly cheesteak. Im talking perfectly  thin sliced steak grilled onions and WIZ. The WIZ certified the cheesesteak. Delicious!  I can bring my family here when they come to visit and not end up swimming with the fishes!  Totally love Genos! Great food, awesome service & a flash back of home...5 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to Geno's a few times now. They aren't the best place in the world, but it's decent. The prices aren't bad, either. My kids like it since there's a huge menu and they can get whatever they feel like. I tried a burger the other day and it was eh."}
{"text":"Yo this place pretty much sucks ass but it's open til 4am which is the only thing it's got going for it. See my pic and decide if the loaf of bread aka sandwich is worth $10 and the stale fries worth $5. (NO)"}
{"text":"Placed an order at 731 pm for delivery online and at 840 pm  called to find out why it was not delivered. Guy on the phone stated that the reason for the delay was the traffic was so bad that from they \"just left\". 40 minutes later after no delivery yet I called again and the lady stated holding her laughter stated it was delivered to another apartment and stated that I put the wrong address. One thing is I know both were lying and the only two things saved it was the manager that called me saying the driver assigned to deliver went home with an apology and the food came hot. Food for thought. Don't lie to your customers when they live a mile and a half from you because worse advertising you can have is an upset customer."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a Genos sub like in philly well that did not happen do bummed that these guys claim they have genos philly steak the grinder was so small didn't even come close to a Arby's steak sandwich if your going to say your a genos sub then damnit be a genos dub, what a waste of money oh yea fries sucked ass save your money..."}
{"text":"Recently ordered from here while watching the playoff games. I gotta say that the Buffalo Chicken Pizza was unbelievable. Couple that on top of a speedy delivery and there's no doubt ill be giving Genos my business for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give a 0 star have to give one. I will never eat here again. It took almost 5 mins for me to be helped while there was 4 workers in the kitchen. I wasn't even greated nor was there an apology for me having to wait. And when I got my pizza the cuts were so un even. How embarassing. And on Saturday they say they're open till 5 am well tried to go in and at 4am all of the chairs were on the tables so I just left and went to gus instead. I'll stick with them for my late night delivery ."}
{"text":"I only write reviews for very good or bad service. Genos Is a 5 star restaurant.  The flavor in their sauce along with the seasoning on their pizza is unbelievable. The quality of the meat topping is exceptional.  There will be some sticker shock but we'll worth the extra few bucks.  The staff is young but surprisingly mature.  They obviously pay for the best. Matti is a great manager and very focused on the entire operation down to the customer satisfaction. Great job guys"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service in Tempe. Slowest delivery times ever. If you call in an order for pick up be prepared to wait 20 mins and an additional 20mins when you get there. When you order delivery u can expect to wait 1-3 hours for food (not an exaggeration) so if you were expecting hot food please lower your expectations. Everyone who works here moves slow as fuck and looks like they hate there job. The only reason I come is because the food is half decent and they are open late. Who ever owns this place really doesn't give a fuck about there business and if it wasn't for asu pumping the life blood in to this place they would have been closed a long time ago."}
{"text":"Looking for a bite late at night this is the place to go!! The pizza is amazing and not greasy like most places. Their buffalo chicken fries are addicting! Not a bad thing on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Food is alright. This place is pretty convenient. I know Geno's are all individually owned so whoever owns this one does not have a care for customer service.  I eat here quite often and never review places, but I have yet to be greeted in a friendly manner, one time I was standing at the register for at least a literal 5-10 minutes just staring at the girl who was talking to her boss about her schedule and what days she can work, when there was me plus 2 other customers waiting to order food. There is a time and place to figure out scheduling. The sad thing is I'll continue to eat here and continue to resent the Geno's employees.   I won't even go into hygiene."}
{"text":"Food was delivered in 30 min. to my place. Cold food was seperated from the hot food. Overall great food and great service."}
{"text":"The pizza is good the phily steaks are horrible salads horrible to bad was exspecting way more then what we got!!! Gross"}
{"text":"My partner ordered a sandwich for herself, and sweet potatoe fries for me (since am gluten intolerant and appetite wasn't big). Once the food came out complete disappointment from my end. Rather than assuming it's one order, separate the two. I was not able to eat my fries due to cross contamination of being on the same \"plate\" with the gluten filled sandwich. Thanks Geno's! I didn't get to eat! \"The fries were cold too!\" Said my partner."}
{"text":"That may have been the worst delivery food I have ever had. My pizza came cold and smothered in oregano. My wings came soggy and luke warm. I spent $20, and had one bite of the pizza and 1 wing. I hate wasting food."}
{"text":"ordered some late night food and it took 1 hour and 10 mins before my food got to my house and when it did get there the ranch was missing for my wings, which didn't seem to have a lot of medium sauce. the cheese sauce for the fires was cold and the soda was hot. when taking my order i kept getting put on hold i felt rushed when placing the order. this was my first time every trying the place and i don't think i will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Okay so This place sucks so bad!!! DO NOT EAT THE WINGS! I REPEAT DO NOT EAT THE WINGS!!! This place has not cleaned the oil in a very very long time. And you can taste it. My order took almost a full hour and I I've a mile while! I was not able to get my money back but I got store credit for a place I would never want to eat again. Overall fuck this place. Don't waste your time or your money on this place."}
{"text":"First time here and we give it a solid 4 stars. Provolone philly is delicious! We will certainly come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience the first time I ordered delivery from the place. Then the owner went out of her way to make it right, so I gave it a second chance and things went well.   So, I ordered food a couple more times since and tonight was my 5th time ordering. The delivery once again took well over an hour and the driver couldn't find my apartment, by now I figured somebody would have put notes in the system.   This time I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and loaded fries. Once again my food was COLD, WORSE THAN THE FIRST TIME. So cold that once I got the pizza box inside my apartment, the outside of the box was noticeably cold, I opened it and touched the pizza and it was too late. The guy was gone. Fries once again were cold and coagulated. I can't put into words how disappointed and upset I am, other than I will never be ordering food for delivery or in person from this place again. Getting cold food I'm paying $20+ for two out of five times is enough for me. Don't bother contacting me and offering me free food again. I don't want it, no butt kissing is going to fix this. I'm just putting this up here to warn others. SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE THAT APPRECIATES IT"}
{"text":"Great place always trying new things...very clean store great staff and busy! Food is great! Subs and the choice of fries is my favorite. The pizza is awsome my favorite is the Philly steak specialty. I drive from gilbert to here for better service and pizza! I know there are others but this is clean and have people working who know what they are doing."}
{"text":"A halfway descent place for a Cheesteak but not the typical PA type hoagie/pizza shop.They are a dime a dozen there but with it being limited here in PHX Geno's is slightly above average relatively speaking."}
{"text":"After having a semi bad experience with the cheese steaks, the owner offered to give me 20 credit, but I didn't take it.  I wanted to try other things in the menu and since I was in town, I decided to grab another bite.  Before I go on, what I forgot to mention in my last review is about the service.  The staff was friendly and attentive to my order and they treated me the same during my 2nd visit.  The store remained clean and the environment was still a place I didn't mind being in.  As far as the food goes.  This time I tried something different.  I saw that they had Gyros so I took a chance on that.  Philly fries sounded good as well so I put that up on the order too.    They were slammed with phone orders and I was behind 2 other customers.  The wait wasn't too long considering that they had to handle a lot (so no complaints there)  Once I got my food, both looked and smelled delicious.  Gyro served on a platter with all the fix-ins that made it right.  The Pita bread wasn't crisp or dry, and it was served nice and warm.  The Philly fries were a little bit salty.  But this time, I didn't need to drown the meat in ketchup to enjoy it.  It was decent enough to claim the word \"satisfying\".  It's a great and different side order.  It's pretty much a cheese steak on top of french fries, but that combination works really good.  Overall, the food was a bit better the 2nd time around.  I'll probably come by for another visit if I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"I ordered from them on many occasions. But then I ordered from them earlier this month, and it was absolutely disgusting! The food was extremely greasy, cold, and just thrown together! I will never eat Geno's garbage they call food ever again!!!"}
{"text":"There delivery service SUCKS BIG TIME!!! I have already called the store twice asking where my food is (ordered @ 1:04pm and its now 2:37pm)...they originaly said 45min!!! This place is a sham!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Genoa pizza around 1:30/2 am the manager on duty Bridget was very rude and disrespectful. I had ordered a pizza and she denied me a water cup and said \" we don't offer free water here\" she then continued to give me attitude. The food here is great but the customer service makes me think twice before returning. I work an HR position in the state of AZ and will be reporting this. I unfortunately am giving this place 0 stars"}
{"text":"6 out of 10 on the pizza 9 out of 10 on the steak cheese and mushroom  10/10 on the bread of the sandwich   A little over priced but very good sandwich. The pizza was a little to buttery, ask for no butter would be my suggestion."}
{"text":"Tried the 6\" original cheesesteak, tasty but tiny.   For 5.99 it was more bread then meat. Quite disappointing. I'm fine paying that much, but give me a sandwich that has the meat falling out!   The flavors were good, grilled onions + cheese sauce went well. I do appreciate that the bread was fresh. But don't be cheapskates, give people a sandwich to come back for!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality for such a bargain! Although yes, I'm a New Yorker and I am a bit biased about my pizza but I definitely recommend Geno's to East Coasters!"}
{"text":"This place  is past disgusting the food is nasty the cashiers are horrible in taking orders I'm telling you now please save your money"}
{"text":"Damn good pizza. Since I ate there no idea about delivery. The cheese steak was pretty good. Still, the pizza was perfect, big long slices with a thin seasoned crust with just the right kind of cheese and a little grease to make it bad for you when you fold it to eat it. I'll definitely get the slice again if I am in this part of town."}
{"text":"I received an offer of a credit from the owner with a request that I try them again. That was very nice but I declined. Still, they did make an effort. Kudos for caring."}
{"text":"Oh the disappointment when the food is a no go on your cheat day. The pizza was ridiculously greasy and the cheese got cold so fast ;( it was a nightmare !"}
{"text":"Everything I've gotten from here is good. Delivery is always timely, and the food is hot and fresh when it gets to me. Both the chicken Philly and regular Philly subs are good. The garlic fries are great too."}
{"text":"Eh. I love cheesesteaks. I just thought it would be better. It was definitely the meat, flavor? Not cooked enough? Not sure but just not that great. Also girl in phone was rude."}
{"text":"So being the first time trying this place was definitely not impressed !  I just ordered a regular deli style Italian sandwich number 1 the bread was dried out , the tomatoes were yellow not even ripe , and the sign says comes with mayo and dressing , well the bread had no mayo on either side it was squirted in the middle of the sandwich ! So that just made the dry bread worse then it was ! I have had plenty of Italian subs and this one def not even close to a Italian sub , no peppers no onion just lettuce tomatoes half ass mayo no dressing , and the meat !"}
{"text":"After ordering. I called 3 times. I received my food 1 hour and 32 minutes later. The girl aria who was on the phone was very rude, interruptive and hung up twice without a word. Very rude service. I received my food and was told \"sorry we were busy\". The wings were small, and hard, and the sub I ordered was cold and too salty, with none of the ingredients that were supposed to come on it. Overall for customer service, delivery and food, I give this place one star. Terrible and I would never think of wasting my money here again if I was starving and this was the last place on earth that had food. If rather die!"}
{"text":"Average pizza . Cheese stake was disappointing especially if there taking the famous Genos name."}
{"text":"We had a coupon, and decided to try this place out while in town. It was delicious! We enjoyed a large pepperoni with garlic crust with a side of the most wonderful cheese bread I've had. Yum!"}
{"text":"Foods okay. Delivery is normally not the best idea. You guys were so close to following my instructions for food, but still failed. I feel like your cooks worked for me and disappointed me at some point. Its not hard to read a ticket and know what the person wants or, call the the customer to make sure. I hope noone there got raises for the holidays.. youre just one step above gus's pizza and i will never eat at that place again. If i wanted my food to not be made the way i ask, id gotto mcdonalds and terrorize their $15hr wanting asses!"}
{"text":"Horrible service,never can get order right in over a year, reason I keep ordering is convenience. Order never right. Horrible  I mean the worst possible service and Tobie never returns phone calls. Takes an act of congress for that. Staff doesn't know menu."}
{"text":"Woooowww this place is terrible guys!!!  Don't get me wrong... Tempe (mostly around ASU) as a whole is AWFUL if you enjoy GOOD food - but this is one of the worst. Ordered for delivery (they charge $5-wtf.) & we got the food - not only was the \"half cheese steak\" literally 3'5 inches for $5-$7, it was drenched in grease the bread was soggy, the cheese was not even there, the steak was alright, and the onions were hardly there.... My husband said the Swiss burger wasn't bad, the wings were the size of literal mouse drippings - hardly a bite each, and the cheese fries were covered in the greasy watery cheese... Sad! Sad! Sad!"}
{"text":"Ok. I have to admit it. Genos really won me back. I was contacted by Toby, the owner, personally, and she apologized profusely for the sub-par service I experienced the last time I ordered. She comp'ed the entire meal, and this time, the food arrived quickly, was hot a fresh, and DELICIOUS! Seriously, I'm not a big burger guy,but this pepper burger I ordered is truly 10/10. If you've had a poor experience in the past with Genos, give them another shot. They are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first (and last) time trying their restaurant. We ordered the pizza which was not as good as I expected, and the euro was absolutely awful! It tasted like a cheeseburger wrapped in pita bread!!! I couldn't finish it and threw it out. Even that Zieke sauce tasted more like Mayo and maybe a little cucumber. Not good at all."}
{"text":"I have to say the food here is amazing, love the cheese steak and pizza, however I was a regular customer would come here at least once or twice a week, now I really dont like coming here because the counter people are so rude and just seem like they hate life! I can understand people have a bad day, but just to be down right rude to a customer after the first time i came back and the same thing but different person, which sucks because i really liked this place, but wont go back , because i am not going to some place that has extremly rude employees!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken bacon ranch pizza was pretty bomb.  Wings were really good.  Salad was a piece of crap. They charged me $6 for a side salad.  Called it a Cesar salad. Sprinkled a couple packets of Parmesan on top.  Not shredded Parmesan.  You guys have to step it up.  There are plenty of other pizza places."}
{"text":"I read bad reviews and avoided this place. They were wrong. Delivery was fast and hot. Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm eating my original philly cheese steak and it's nothing but bread and meat. I mean, a damn cheesesteak is supposed to have cheese WHERES THE CHEESE?! No veggies, no flavor, just a pathetic sorry hogue with meat in it. I couldn't be more disappointed. Waste of $10, spend your money somewhere else. Absolutely ordinary, and nothing special at all. I could have found other places to spend my money."}
{"text":"This is the very first review I am writing and I am doing so from my car. I placed a take out order for two philly cheese fries with extra onion and mushroom. I picked up my order and drove off to the movies. I get there and open the container. The first one was fine, the second has basically no cheese, one little sliver of onion and one tiny piece of mushroom. I just paid $16.00 for fries!!! and this is what I get? I call and am told I can return it now and wait for a replacement or I can return it after my movie and they would replace it then. I explain this is my dinner and ask if I am supposed to wait 2 1/2 hours for that and the \"manager\" tells me \"Well I can't bring it to you\" I inform her I will not be dining there again and she says \"okay great! Have a good night\" Horrible experience."}
{"text":"This was such an awful experience, still seeking what we can do about getting in touch with corporate. My friend and I were looking forward to Geno's so much so that we drove out of our way to have it. I redeemed the yelp offer for free fries or drink. We walked in and the girl at the counter was talking with her friends and wouldn't acknowledge us. We didn't get a \"what can I get for you\" or anything. She simply looked up from her register, we took this as a cue to order. We ordered a pepperoni pizza with sausage, Greek fries and garlic fries. We requested ranch seasoning on the crust, we had it before at a different location and it was great. I asked to redeem my check in offer to which I was told they \"no longer accept coupons.\" She told me I could order online and use it, which makes no sense since it was a check-in offer. We got our fries, her garlic fries had such a small portion and the cheese on my Greek fries was burnt. We were starving so we ate them anyways. Our pizza came out and this was where the major issue started. To our surprise there was ranch dressing squirted on the crust and the sausage looked like it had gone bad. My friend went to the counter and asked the girl about it thinking maybe there was a misunderstanding about ranch sauce vs. ranch seasoning and also the sausage. By this time we both just wanted to leave due to the poor customer service. She requested a refund, to which the girl said she could but she had to call her manager. When she came back she said her manager had told her we could have a new pizza but no refund. She went on to tell us that there is no corporate number when we asked and it's not her fault that they don't do things like other Geno's.  We didn't even want a full refund, just for the pizza itself. Disappointing since I just moved and this is the closest location and they have late hours."}
{"text":"I don't know what star to leave. Idk what it is but if I order from this place before 5pm it's phenomenal and after 5pm it's as bad as I cook, hence the reason I'm ordering out!!!"}
{"text":"If you've never had their Philly steak you're really missing something they also have excellent pizza"}
{"text":"Found a big piece of plastic in my garlic fries. Nice. I called, and the \"store manager,\" said \"uhh, what would you like us to do?\" I responded by saying I'd just take a refund, because he sounded like he really didnt care. He told me I had to call grub hub and get a refund from them. This place is absolutely  disgusting. DO NOT eat here."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous expensive!!! Not even that good of food, the store is messy bunch of employees laying around, a small burger for 7.50$ ????? WTF"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day and the only thing I'm pissed about is that I haven't gone here sooner! The girl that took my boyfriends and I order was super sweet I wish I got her name. The food was delicious and it came out super quick! They definitely got a long time customer"}
{"text":"So I happen to live across the street from this restaurant and they do open late until early in the morning which is definitely a plus. With that being said the food that I have tried here has just been okay so far. I did try a slice on the NY style cheese pizza and it was okay but nothing special. I thought the garlic and parmesan breadsticks were underwhelming as you can hardly taste the flavors at all, not to mention it was very greasy.  I did see quite a few people order take-out for a large size pizza so I may have to try that sometime (since they're open late). So far I haven't been too impressed with coming here though but I'm willing to try them again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The workers were completely disrespectful to me and my friends. Would not give us water cups or even a smile. Being paying customers I expect to be treated with respect. Never coming to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Super bomb food..the pizza was delicious and the slice was big ....the wings are so good"}
{"text":"Glad I saw they didn't close down. I don't know about your pizza, but I do know about the subs and garlic fries...still great!!! FYI...I'm not from Philly, but this old Phx hood rat thinks it's much better then almost anything we get in the valley."}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the take out service, which if done correctly would have Garnered Geno's a perfect 5 star as the quality of the food is top notch, and it's the only place to get an authentic Philly cheesesteak around. That said, I have now had 3 separate orders that have come missing items, wrong, or a combination of both. From a pizza ordered that was missing toppings chosen, to a salad having toppings that were not supposed to be on the salad, it appears that the care to ensure delivery/takeout orders is at the bottom of the checklist. I'll continue to frequent Geno's, but only if I can make it in to order in person and check the order prior to leaving. It's a shame because there's nothing better than watching some football with some excellent delivery, but the attention to detail just isn't there with Geno's, which turns excitement for food into disappointment and anger.  Edit: I should have read reviews earlier as I have found that all the negative ones are about delivery being wrong, cold, late.."}
{"text":"Was so sad when I drove by the old location and it was a new name, then pleasantly surprised to find out they just moved around the corner.   Love the free seasoned crust with my lunch special slice and soda."}
{"text":"My stomach was  upset previously and the genos famous cheesesteak just made it even worse. I enjoyed it while I was eating it but payed for it in the end."}
{"text":"I have been here before and did not have a real favorable experience with the food this morning I stopped in thinking I would pick something up not realizing they are closing go into the bathroom take my seat and the lights go out it's completely dark. Thank God I'm a smoker and I carry a lighter but I was not able to find the light switch in the bathroom anyway. When I go out and let them know at the counter that the lights are out in the bathroom while I was using it he says sorry we're closing and gives me the opportunity to finish using the bathroom nor does he truly apologize for having not checked the bathroom and making it dark in the first place. Just another unfavorable experience at this dump in the wall I highly doubt I'll ever give them another try. So far the two times I have been there the food was garbage and then it goes dark in the bathroom and they don't even let you finish using it."}
{"text":"The food WOULD be great... But the salt factor is overwhelming. Their loaded fries are the BEST! But their cheese bread was an oily mess of soggy. And they don't listen to directions well when you ask to hold or add an ingredient. Unfortunately, the only thing good is their loaded fries. Delivery is not the best option. Delivery entails a soggy, cold mess. Not worth it unless you are starving and need a side of extra salty."}
{"text":"Definitely get \"genos cheesesteak\" comes with a side of some vinegar slightly spicy dressing....without doubt within my top 3 of all time cheesesteaks. Also for good measure I tried a slice of pep....super thin crust but not the crunchy style. Good texture good flavor, I would say this would be new York style. On a scale from 1-10 Cheesesteak 10 Pizza 7 Service 6 (girl at counter seems to be preoccupied, while looking directly at you she doesn't exactly acknowledge what your saying. It's like she's waiting for you talk while your talking if it makes sense. Not rude just kinda awkward)"}
{"text":"Am sorry for what i said and the manger fixed what happened and she was really nice and gave me store credit! They're food is always good man! Love the chicken pita!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to be a pretend to be an expert on cheesesteaks. The only thing that I know is that a \"Wit Whiz\" is the ONLY WAY to make a cheesesteak, not some peppers and provolone way.  With that out of the way, let me tell you about Geno's. It's not a bad 'steak. It just costs too much. Does it beat Forefather's? No. No one does. Does it beat Philly's Famous, Philly's, or Zesty Zzeeks? Well, probably not, but it's not bad, is what I'm saying. Just too expensive.  The fries are good & hot, as was the 'steak, Wit Whiz. I may be back for a second try, but unless the price on a sandwich comes down, I know how it tastes."}
{"text":"Is there ZERO stars awarded? I ordered food very late... I understand that's upsetting to the type of workers that are in this industry, I've been there... but I got hung up on twice by some girl on MARCH 10th if you'd like to specify the exact timing and the person who I spoke to. That's ridiculous to me... I've worked at Hooters for 4 years and dealt with drunk asshole but all I ordered were cheese sticks and some wings and I asked where they were. I only got upset AFTER she hung up on me the first time :/ what a witch. Get over yourself. I'm sorry you have to work til 4 in the morning but that's your job."}
{"text":"Update: The owner called to reach out to me after my awful experience. She was very kind, apologetic and offered a credit to try them again in hopes of swaying my opinion. She made an effort and its very appreciated. I'll still never order delivery but I definitely will consider them for a quick option when in the area. Food was spot on. Will be back during daytime hours only."}
{"text":"First time here, so I have no reason to tell it any other way than what it was...  Ordered the mushroom philly.  Got a free order of fries, which was a nice bonus.  The sandwich arrived promptly,  and was the surface of the sun hot...needed to wait a bit for it to cool.  Fries were crisp and salted perfectly.   After letting the philly regulate...it was very delicious and full of mushroom goodness.  Maybe a bit salty for my taste, but a solid buy.  I will come back."}
{"text":"The new renovations at this location are fantastic.  The staff is always very friendly and always helpful.  They have great lunch specials and are always quick.  I can highly recommend the Philly Fries, but the toasted sandwiches are also really good."}
{"text":"***UPDATE*** From 2 stars to 3  I had just received a VERY nice note from a Senior Geno's Official (and that's probably not her real title) who assured me that the issues with delivery have been addresses. She seemed genuine and sincere so if I'm being honest, I'm inclined to give the delivery team a second (or so) chance hahaha.  Again, as I said in my initial review, the good I had while I was a dine-in customer was really good and the people there were very nice too. Here's to hoping the delivery times is better. :)"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing service. Placed a decent sized delivery order ($51) and tipped $7 from the yelp app last Saturday night, and being that I wasn't ordering directly through Geno's I called to confirm my order went through. They said it had and that I had a 1 hr and 20 minute wait even though the yelp app said it would be 30-40. I said that was fine and me and my roommates took a nap and set our alarm for an hour from then. Upon waking to the alarm I noticed I had ONE missed call from 40 minutes earlier. I checked the door to see if we had missed the delivery/and pick up our pizza. There was nothing there. I immediately called Geno's and they said they had called several times and knocked. The door bell was never rang, and I only received one call and they didn't leave the pizza at the door even tho I had already paid. They said they could not re-deliver, I could not pick it up, and I could not be refunded. If this is how Geno's conducts their business I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"First time.. ordering here on a late Sunday; The menu was okay not a lot to choose from but it's alright. Anyways, I thought to order something small (sweet potato fries) The order took about a good hour for a full sub and the fries. I'm quite disappointed the fries&sub were cold! So cold the taste didn't exist. Definitely, won't be order delivery from here no more."}
{"text":"We ordered a burger, cheese steak, and pizza from here. All decent and no complaints so I decided to try their sandwiches since Jimmy John's won't deliver to me- despite being under 2.5 mi away ... it's hard to find a dang place that will send over regular subs (No to meatball, parmesan, etc)! I was so happy to see Genos does. I ordered an oven baked turkey sub, a regular turkey sub, and an Italian sub. - NOT all eaten but I'm pregnant and couldn't decide which I wanted. I have to heat the deli meat anyway to kill any bacteria, pg problems. ANYWAY, they got my order correct, AND included LOTS of pickles per my request. They didn't skimp on the meat and the subs are huge. I think I have 6 meals taken care of now. A half is perfect for me.  Management- thank you so much for those pickles. I needed them!"}
{"text":"I am a NY pizza snob. Stopped for lunch. Pizza by the slice or pie. These are large thin crust that you can fold over as pizza should be. I had pepperoni with the garlic crust. I don't think I will try others. Totally loved it. Look I'm a fat old new Yorker. This is the best pizza in Tempe and maybe the valley until someone shows me better."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!! Philly and onion rings was great!! May try the pizza next time!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service!  I've lived in the apartments next to Geno's for about a year now, and dine here pretty frequently Had nothing but great service.   I encourage you to try the place out for yourself!"}
{"text":"They  are not \"Geno's Steaks\" of Philadelphia , BUYER BEWARE! THEY MADE THEIR NAME SIMILAR BUT THEY ARE NO AFFILIATION.  For the price it could be better 12 dollars for a cheese steak,  no drink.   Nathan's or anywhere else is much better,  but the deception of \"GENO'S\" is what upset me.  Name yourself Geno's; be even a little bit like GENO'S STEAKS then.  They are dependant on kids living off momma and daddy.  They care nothing about reasonable product for the price. My Philly was just slightly thicker than a pencil. Read the other reviews to see why they got one star.  Have fun ripping dumb college kids off. I'm to old for that. I can't put any mustard on this.  Find a authentic cheese steak then let me know where to go.  Thanks."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and over an hour later we called and they told us the driver had just left the store with our food, we only live 4 miles away.. then after 35 minutes of waiting with no food we called again... I asked to speak to a manager and they put me on hold for 10 more minutes, when our food finally arrived it was freezing cold, missing items, and tasted horrible. The manager was rude and unprofessional. There's tons of pizza places around Tempe, I advise you to order somewhere else!!! I'd give this place 0 stars if that was possible, the 1 star is for the fact that their ranch was good."}
{"text":"This place is so legit! I'm from the east coast. If you can find a better cheesesteak let me know! Probly won't hear from you because this is hands down the best. Keep doing what you are doing Genos.............. I've had Genos in multiple locations. They are all consistent."}
{"text":"I come here quite often, and they've just newly renovated the dining area giving it a fresh, more open feel. The service is always friendly and quick.  I recommend the Buffalo Chicken specialty pizza. It's my favorite. :) The prices are modest and you get quite a bit for your money."}
{"text":"well shit, since PSC is gone and defalcos is a bit further from home.. genos is a good option for a cheesesteak from time to time. hows about wiz wit onion.. add jalapeno. gets the job done and is the best cheesesteak this part of town, however the search is never over."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim while over this way for a conference. Very impressed. Great value and amazing food. Pizza was pretty darn close to what I've gotten in NYC. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We just stop by today our first time there and everything was great the service was really good and we will be back we got a 24 inch pepperoni pizza we got a dozen of hot wings and a dozen barbecue wings three cheesesteaks and one turkey sandwich and everything was great can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place. Pizza is fresh and the sauce is really tasty. The employees are always friendly. Great place to grab a slice, salad, or sandwich."}
{"text":"I had the worlds worst cheese steak sub. Three bites and it was finished. The hot Italian sub was average at best. Cheese fries are your every day cheese fries. The portioning compared to pricing is way off. That is all."}
{"text":"this place is terrible  i ordered wings and they put icing on my wings and spilled a drink im pissed never eat here"}
{"text":"An actual Suburban-style Philadelphia Cheesesteak Hoagie in Tempe, AZ!  Don't let the name fool you.  If you are expecting a cheesesteak like you'd get at Geno's on Passayunk Ave, well, you won't.  This isn't that style of cheesesteak.  But, it is  a very good cheesesteak like you'd find in all of the suburbs surrounding the city.  When you're from Philadelphia and away from home, sometimes you just need a \"Cheesesteak\" and not a \"Philly Steak and Cheese\"...whatever that is.  In all my travels I have only encountered a good cheesesteak in 1 place outside of Philadelphia.  That was in Houston and it was perfect, complete with the jumbo can of Cheez Whiz on the grill.  Now, I have found 2.  This time in Tempe.  Most of the time you can tell from reading the menu that you just shouldn't even bother to try.  You can always find pizza or Chinese food.  But, this menu was close enough to what I'd find at home to risk it.  I'm glad I did.  Cheesesteak Hoagie just like home, delivered to my hotel.  Thank you, Geno's."}
{"text":"First time customer.  Ordered a cheesesteak sandwich.  Sitting next door at the Sleepy Dog Brewery while I'm eagerly digging into this sammich and three bites in im greeted with a  L O N G black hair intertwined in the beef.  I'm in disbelief thinking it's just a fiberous gristle from the beef as I pull it out I realize it's not cow.  I went back & demanded a full refund.  Sorry, forgot to take a pic."}
{"text":"Fuck this place. They will never receive another cent from me. They have messed up my orders multiple times and I kept giving them chances. Tonight was the last one. How the fuck do I order steak fries and get home to NO STEAK??? I don't ask for much and don't put in crazy orders but if I order STEAK fries I expect STEAK. If you decide to continue to support this establishment I suggest you check your order before you leave. Smh. Just ridiculous..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Never been but have ordered multiple times for delivery. Their cheesesteaks are amazing and cheesey bread sticks. Seriously- it's perfect for when you're drunk hungover or just plain hungry and want a good cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I live right across the street. I like this place a lot. I get a Greek salad with grilled chicken that is made different every time. I don't feel the manager is there a lot. Front staff is nice."}
{"text":"I do love Geno's! I've done To-Go orders so often that once I come in they already know which order is mine, haha! I've only encountered great workers, my bf and I love their mild wings, pizza, and huge brownies! This place is down the street from us and is good and convenient!  I do wish they gave water cups when we dine in."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here about once a week or every other week. Their service can be sketchy if they are really busy from time to time but we will always go back since they are right across the street. They have delivery but we usually do the curbside pickup since it's convenience. The slice and a drink is a great deal. We like their pizza, wings and their cheesesteaks are great! We have had many things including some of the sides here and almost all of it is good. However, I wish their salads were better than just iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"Just received my delivery , the food was okay. If it was hot i'm sure it would be tastier.  The driver called and accused me of putting the incorrect address, he was sure because the receipt he had had some address unknown to me. My order confirmation had the correct address, which I advised him but he was very defensive and told me I was wrong. WHATEVER. I don't know if it was delivery service or the restaurant.  On top of that my order was missing a drink which was $2 and tax. I paid $22 for a late order, defensive driver and no drink. NOT AGAIN, NO THANK YOU."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, especially the Baked fries! Ordered through GrubHub and was pleasantly surprised with every item we received! Five stars all around!"}
{"text":"Ordered thru yelp/eatstreet.. Over and hour and a half and no food.. Called them to cancel my order.. Girl that answered the phone said they couldn't find the order even though I received an email confirmation and they charged my card.. She didn't apologize not one time or try to make the situation right and directed me to eatstreet to call and get my money back.. I called eatstreet who actually offered an apology even though it wasn't their fault and refunded my money... Eatstreet told me Gino's had confirmed my order.. If you are the owner and read this at least teach ur employees to apologize and make a situation right... Smh"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken fajita salad and a piece of their cheese pizza. I LOVE the cheese pizza. I'm not really a huge pizza fan, especially cheese pizza, but this was amazing. I did a carryout order, and I waited too long to go get my food, so the salad was a little unappetizing by the time I picked up my order, but I still enjoyed my food, and had an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Visited at 2am on a Monday. Surprised at how many customers there were, Was iffy about going here because I've never tried it, but I am so glad we did, it was clean, organized, and the food was amazing! Fast service and fresh food. A++"}
{"text":"It thought the cheese steak was great. Fries were above average and I do like the new style soda machine with a thousand options.  Overall the place was clean and presentable. The open kitchen had a nice clean appearance.  Problems... Cashier could've been a little more informative about their favorites, we told her it was our first visit and we struggled to get an answer on what was great there. We finally settled on the cheesesteak by default, not recommendation.  I also bought two half sandwiches of the same thing and noticed that you get free fries with a full sandwich. Just figured she would recommend the free fries, especially since I hinted on it then just bought them.  They also have a promo for free fries for Yelp users but I didn't want to beg for free fries, so I just let it go. Just down the street is a brand new portillos which is basically the same concept on steroids. Going to a place like this I would've expected a smaller and more personalized experience which never happened. I would think they would be busier if they were a little more on point.  Oh... The ketchup seemed watery... Weird."}
{"text":"Chose to order from here because it was pretty late and many places had closed for the night already. Great decision! Driver for the delivery was very polite and called prior to arriving to confirm the address since I ordered through the app and she knew the area tends to provide the wrong address. Pizza was spot on! Thin crust and great toppings all over the pizza. The boneless buffalo wings were the standard fair with ample sauce. The cheesesteak was delicious! Enough cheese, perfect onion and pepper ratio and the mushrooms added made the sandwich perfect. If I'm in the area again I'll definitely order."}
{"text":"Great place don't know what some of these people talk about, I've eaten at many places and when a place is busy things may take a few extra minutes, I bet some of these same people wait in line at Starbucks for an hour, and then complain about the price but then go put money in a slot machine. Hands down this is a solid place."}
{"text":"Great tasting food but probably some of the smallest portions I've had. Only worth it if nothing else is open when you're drunk."}
{"text":"I had the large cheese pizza. While I sat and waited I observed the following. Phones have the most germs on them of almost anything.  The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.  The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.  Pizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.  On a previous visit I had the gyro sandwich. I found it to be very wet and gooey, not much flavor at all to the meat.  My last visit. I will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering.   My problem is the lack of being sanitary."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes great, the staff is friendly, and it's clear this is a late night got spot for students and others alike. The hours are appealing after a long night of partying.   The wait; however, is what keeps this from a 5-star review. Perhaps it cannot be helped with the traffic that comes through. Perhaps in the future they will develop more efficient methods of food creation. Time will tell..."}
{"text":"Best Philly that I've had since the one's I've eaten in Philadelphia (maybe even better). Good stuff.  Great service. Worth the price. Go! You won't be let down. Oh yeah... baked fries are the bomb too!!!"}
{"text":"Mike is the best cook ever! And the pizzas are the best! The hot sweet and tangy wings are my fav!  try the baked fries!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express near Sky Harbor and quickly realized my delivery food options were slim to none around lunchtime. After some Yelp filtering I found this place and figured why not give it a shot.   I ordered through the online system within Yelp which was very easy to use and navigate. My quoted wait time was 45-60 mins and my order did arrive to my hotel room door by that time.  Food wise my sandwich was pretty good. I had the Italian sub, toasted with mild peppers added. The bread was a bit soggy when it arrived, but that was probably due to the car ride. The taste of the meats was really my favorite. Very flavorful and delicious.  Overall this was a good delivery lunch option and I'd recommend it to any other hotel stayers in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered a slice of pineapple pizza, buffalo chicken fries and a turkey baked sub. So DELICIOUS! First time here, I'm originally from California and I fell in love. Will eat here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Just ordered a slice of pizza and fries.  Slice of pizza was OK, but nothing special.  Garlic fries were mushy, not flavorful, and very overpriced considering the amount given.  $5 for maybe $1.50 worth of fries.  Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Not happy with the service. I made the mistake of going through GrubHub. After waiting an hour and a half for my food I didn't get my full order. Pizza was good but my son was waiting on the wings that we never got not even a courtesy call to tell us they couldn't get us the wings. Last time I order from this place."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a luke warm pizza. We told them and they offered to warm it??? Pizza has to be hot!! Waited another 10 minutes but got a hot one. So much for the sign that stated in 30 minutes or free. It was tasty..."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers, fries, cheesesteak and pizza.  Quick service and clean."}
{"text":"they are the most rude staff ever. dont call in to okqce an order they might just leave you on hold then have an attitude when they get back on the phone!"}
{"text":"As a weekly regular, I have only gotten their pizza & fries. I haven't tried any of their subs or burgers. The food itself tastes good, and the prices are fair. They have a foot long slice for $2.50, and you can get a flavored crust. They are open til 5am every day, so you can count on Geno's for a midnight snack. They just remodeled the inside of the restaurant a few months ago, but I normally get takeout. Their service is fast, not taking more than 15mins to get my takeout. Geno's also provides delivery through Yelp or Uber Eats. I currently also get 10% back in Uber credits every time I eat at Geno's, due to some Visa Local Rewards program I signed up through the default Uber app."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Probably wont pick delivery again because it took so long. It took an exact hour to get my food. Hope the delivery time will get better"}
{"text":"Worst food we've ever had! Cheese steak was nasty, gyro was bad, even cold cut sandwich was gross! Ended up throwing it all away except the mozzarella sticks which were really good."}
{"text":"Genos is known for its pizzas, wings and especially their cheese steaks! The Tempe location is I guess the one to go too! It's open late especially when you are hungry at late or odd times. The Philly cheesesteak is what I ordered you can get it in 6 inch size or 12 inches for the full price. The sub was very flavorful, fries were hot and crisp! Try the Genos Philly Cheesesteak and I recommend getting the 12 inch for the full effect. Haven't had their pizza or wings but I'm pretty sure they won't disappoint either! Check out this little Jem tho I believe there is 2 locations near campus of ASU."}
{"text":"First time here got some pizza slices and wings the pizza tasted good their slices of pizza are big, will be comin back again"}
{"text":"A+ customer service. I come in there all the time. One of the ladies now knows me by name!"}
{"text":"I have ordered Geno's twice now. Both times it was perfect. I had delivery and pick up. I did pick up because it's right around the corner from my house and they charge a $4 delivery fee. Cost me as much foe the pizza and wings as it did for the fee and tip. Worth it it I really feel too lazy. The wings are great and their specials are inexpensive. I hope they stay good!"}
{"text":"Foods great. staff is nice. I probably order once a month. If you haven't tried you should!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large 1 topping pizza and wings through grubhub and got an email saying delivery time was about an hour. Fine, we're  a busy packing to move anyway. An hour's cool. When they didn't show up, I called grubhub, who called Geno's, and then texted me saying they'd been advised it would be another HOUR wait for our pizza. Now, grubhub has their own customer service issues, which have nothing to do with Geno's. But a TWO HOUR wait for a pizza and wings is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Being a Philly native I have certain expectations for a \"philly cheesesteak.\" The bread is claimed to be Amoroso rolls, which means the world if you know what they are. They don't toast them nor is there enough meat inside. You can take about 2 inches off the ends before you actually hit a bite of meat. These are cool for a late night meal when everything else is disgusting or closed. The pizza isn't bad but always pick up. Delivery is slow and food arrives cold and in poor fashion. Overall it isn't terrible but it's not the best."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. It might take a few minutes to get your order but that's because they cook and make everything fresh. The toasted subs are amazing and the baked fries are as addicting as crack (i say that jokingly because i have never tried crack, i just heard it's addicting). The food is a great value and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Geno's is decent, it's definitely a place that caters to the student population. I eat lunch here for a couple reasons. #1 I've never gotten sick; may sound strange but my job takes me all over and there are a lot of nasty joints in this neighborhood, Geno's is clean. #2 the staff are super friendly. I've found that isn't the cheapest, but go ahead and order that shitty cardboard pizza from Hungry Howie  or turkey meat subs for Subway, you get what you pay for. And seriously, overpriced? They sell foot long slices for $2.49! That's That's a good deal. Additionally, to the others speaking of the \"30 minutes or free\" signage, that refers to eating their giant pie in 30 minutes you dolt, go smoke another blunt stupid! I feel sorry for businesses that have to cater to little asshole kids."}
{"text":"We ordered online through yelp and they evidently go through a third party company, although the food was good it took a little longer then expected and I had to walk out to the driver who didn't seem to understand how apartment numbers worked. I think next time I'll go pick it up. My husband nor I appreciated having to go out and find the delivery driver in the complex. Our complex is small and he just couldn't follow simple directions."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Both of us got food poisoning from the Buffalo Chicken Sub. I have eaten here a few times and have been disappointed on all accounts. Gave it one last shot and will not be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Good food. Kind of a hidden gem but they have great hours. Can't pass up this place in tempe. Their meatball sub is awesome. Service is ok"}
{"text":"took an hour and forty five minutes for delivery and when they finally got close they called to ask for a gate code that was written in on the order. They are highly incompetent and the food was not great. DO NOT ORDER.  sincerely,       a delivery driver who actually does his job"}
{"text":"Wings are amazing, fries are disappointing. Service was solid, the layout sucks though.   Haven't tried their pizza but will do so soon."}
{"text":"Food was alright but a a little expensive. But the food was not good enough for the disrespectful way the delivery boy snatched the money without asking for change. Wouldn't order here again but might eat in if around the city again"}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery for a Steak Fajita Salad, Loaded Fries, Garden Salad,  and a Hoagie Philly Cheesesteak. The loaded fries were my favorite. They made me a happy couch potato that evening. *Drools* The sandwich was not the best or the worst I have tried. The meat was plentiful but not as much cheese was on the sandwich. The salads were sadly disappointing. They seemed wilted and did not have much flavor. The delivery charge was around $5 I believe which overall does not make this a place I will likely order for delivery again. The food was delivered promptly and the delivery driver was polite."}
{"text":"After having several days from hell, I decided to get some pizza since I knew they would be open late and I was starving and they were close by. I was concerned that going in around midnight on a weekday, I would end up with questionable food but I was very wrong. Ordered a pizza with a couple toppings and was shocked at how good it was, especially for the price. I've had comparable pizzas cost twice as much or more. I'm going to turn this place into a regular stop now that I live close by."}
{"text":"Bums me out... I hope for much better. The ONLY benefit to Geno's is the fact that they deliver until 4am... For your average drunkard, that may mean the world, but I work nights and I am up every night. To me it's just dinner, and it was a wack dinner at that. Ordered two pies and they were both dry as can be with very little cheese and little to no toppings. Perhaps I should have ordered a cheese steak instead, but to be honest, this place has little to no incentive to make me want to trade old faithful places. If you are serious about your pizza and your subs.... go to Philly, or NY and just buy a frozen pizza in the meantime... Thanks for delivering late, Geno's, but your food is WACK!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Best Cheesesteak I've had. Pizza is good too. Give it a try you will love it. Great staff also."}
{"text":"I suspect this is a place that gets better the more you drink and the later it gets. I stopped in at 3:30am and got a slice to go. I wasn't drunk but it was late and although the slice looked pathetic it tasted just fine. The price was right though so I didn't feel like I got ripped off. They have a good variety in the menu so I'll likely be back at least one more time to test some more of the options. Staff were friendly and seating area was clean, bathroom was ready for a good cleaning but not disgusting. It's a one person at a time so it could be a wait if you need to use it. This is definitely a late night place so if the food impresses I'll be adding a star soon."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup as I was in a rush. That was at 115pm didn't get my order until 155pm. Food was just average.  Terrible service. Would not go again or recommend"}
{"text":"I was born in Philly and the cheese fries and the provolone cheesesteak was so good."}
{"text":"Our order was said to be here at 8:40 and showed up around 9:10 so half an hour late and I asked if it was hot she said \"warm, I think\".  I knew then I should have said take it back, but I'm a nice guy.  So I brought the food in to give it a try.  The Mushrooms my girl said were decent 7/10 on the lukewarm side.  Her famous philly cheesesteak was not that good 3/10.  I had the loaded fries and I imagine they would have been great 9 or 10 out of 10, but they were lukewarm.  I had the chicken bacon ranch toasted sub which was decent.  I imagine it would have been great 9 or 10 out of 10 had it not been lukewarm.  I'm not in the business of imagining to eat good food, I WANT to eat good food and being lukewarm to cold doesn't cut it.  It's no wonder this restaurant has 1.5 stars overall.  Never again.  Zio's is by far better and they deliver on time and are further away."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, fantastic wings and OMG the baked fries are DELISH.  I haven't tried the cheesesteaks but I have had pretty much all of their baked fries.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because each time I go I have to wait forever for my food even if there is no one else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered a pizza and fries and a 2 liter. I'm really picky when it comes to food but Bridget assured me that I was making the right choice. Pepperoni & ground beef with garlic crust, phenomenal. Garlic fries, delicious. And to wash it all down with a 2 liter of coke! Bridget was right, food was amazing, & her customer service skills, better than more than half the places in Tempe. Good job Genos! Keep it upn"}
{"text":"lovely girl running the ship remembered me from a year ago when i left my meal because it took so long. this time it was much quicker and the pizza is great i love it!!! thank you so much"}
{"text":"I decided to give genos a try, my neighbors order it all the time and tell me its the best pizza in town so I stopped in today finally. I walked in and didn't know how big the menu was, it was so hard to choose from all these delicious items on the menu. A very polite lady with red hair took my order and she was very helpful. I went in expecting to get pizza but ended up ordering a burger and baked fries. The supporting cast was great and cooked my order fast and brought it to me in no time. Delivery drivers were coming in and out the whole time, I now see why this place gets so much business. I recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"First time trying Genos. The food is pretty good, but that's not why I gave it 2 stars. I ordered full mushrooms and they only put them on half ($3 charge for full coverage) and the women at the counter insisted she didn't have our order so i went to make sure it got placed and noticed we got charged a second time. My boyfriend went in and showed her the two charged and the women argued with him that there was nothing she could do. We work right down the street where we use this site so we knew that was a load of crap. She said she took care of it, but we'll have to wait and see if she really did."}
{"text":"I was driving by and saw this so decided to check it out. I had heard about their flavired crusts..Ok...Im down. I was there on a Wed afternoon after 3 so the lunch specials, which looked awesome, were already over but...I heard the cashier, who was incredibly nice, tell the girl in line in front of me that there were $5 one topping pizzas. Ok, cool, I ordered a cheese pizza and some bread sticks and waited about 10 min. My order was ready and when I got home, I went for a slice and was baffled by what I saw. They actually drizzled ranch dressing on the crust of the pizza. Seriously? WTF? I threw the soggy, obviously overcooked hunk of shit away. The breadsticks were delicious,hot and fresh but verrrrry garlicky. There was also a sauce of some sort on the table so I took a to go thing with some in it and it was like Frank's red-hot sauce and vinegar, maybe? It tasted weird. Im just so disappointed. I wanted to really like this place. I'll probably give them another try as they sell burgers, gyros and cheese steaks too."}
{"text":"I'm usually not big on thin crust pizza but Geno's is so tasty! And the prices can't be beat!   I odered a slice with only cheese and somehow it was like biting into a triangle of heaven. I saw God. \"Pizza God\".   They are right in line behind my beloved Spinatos, as far as the tastiness factor goes.  The night I visited, my girlfriend and I were being total hogs and we both ordered pizza as well as french fries. I do not recall which fries she ordered (hers came with pepperoni and I don't eat meat), but she raved about them incessantly.  I ordered the greek fries to go with my pizza and OH EM GEE- they were SO BOMB! I cannot even describe the greasy, cheesy scrumptiouness in exact terms, but trust me, if you wanna break your diet (and I mean REALLY BREAK IT), come to Geno's for pizza & fries!!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews this doesn't surprise me.   Ordered delivery and they got the order wrong.  Called and asked if they could give me a refund and they said no.  I looked at my receipt just to make sure I didn't accidentally order the wrong thing and I didn't, it was a mistake on their part.  The extra star is for the driver who was really polite and nice."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Amazing garlic chicken sandwich with the red sauce. Owners are really welcoming. Great family owned place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was also good. The whole Yelp and get fries is a great deal. Like this place."}
{"text":"I had an AWFUL experience with this location. \"Sarah\" hung up on me after she told me they were out of my area. Then after I called her out on her unprofessionalism, she proceeded to call me three times on a blocked caller id. Worst service ever. I understand it's 3am but you are still being paid to do a job and you were not doing it."}
{"text":"Place is great. Love that thier open late. Try the hogie philly. Best in town. Extra chz extra mayo. Nothing better."}
{"text":"My go to eat in/take out pizza, wing, cheese steak spot. Open late and they have cheap lunch specials.   Check out their coupons. They had one that was x4 1 topping large pizzas for $20 -- and they're good pizzas w flavored crust and all -- you can't beat that!  They recently got one of those cool, new coke machines where you can customize your flavored beverages (lime coke, or any other flavored drink you can think of). Great addition.   Cheesesteaks are bangin. Honey buffalo wings are on point. They also have $5 chicken bacon ranch fries that are great and will fill ya right up for cheap. Even their Greek salad is pretty good for a pizza take out spot.   Love this place!"}
