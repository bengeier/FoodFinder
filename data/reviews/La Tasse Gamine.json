{"text":"Quoi de plus naturel que de se changer les idées en allant boire un café... Si ce constat relève de l'évidence, c'est plus facile à dire qu'à faire pour les parents de jeunes enfants, qui ne sont pas toujours les bienvenus dans les cafés montréalais, où plusieurs travaillent sur leur portables et sont importunés au moindre bruit. Ce café a justement été conçu pour ces jeunes parents. En plus du café biologique et équitable qu'on y sert, on peut même y acheter des purée pour bébé. De plus, des jouets sont à disposition des enfants de la clientèle, qui peuvent jouer sans embarrasser leurs parents. Outre les biscuits, muffins, bagels et autres produits sucrés qu'on sert en général dans les cafés, il est également possible de manger sur place des soupes et des sandwichs. Bref, cet établissement est une destination idéale pour aller prendre un café ou manger une bouchée avec un enfant en bas âge."}
{"text":"Update April 2017: This place is closing or might already be closed.  So far, after being back in Montreal for over a month, this is the ONLY place I could find where you can have a REAL meal as well as Wifi and let your child play in a confined play area. That in itself is worth 100 stars.  They have all sorts of toys but I WISH there were more kids as when we got there there were only a few French kids and they didn't care to interact with my son (language barrier or just snobs?)  The food was AMAZING! It did take a while to prepare but the lentil soup really hit the spot. My 2.5 year old son enjoyed his grilled cheese and fruit plate, he actually took 3 bites! That doesn't sound like a lot but usually he refuses to eat at restaurants so it's a start.  It seems like people come here for playdates with people they already know so don't expect your child to make new friends here (of course, this is just based off 1 experience so who knows)  I was told that this place is really popular on weekends during brunch.  Pros: Wifi and child entertainment, good food Cons: Paid parking, not many kids weekdays during the day (not that my child really minded)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there isn't more hype about this place! Great if you have little kids!  Have some adult time while the kids play in their play area! The food is all home-made and fresh. Reasonable prices. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised there's not more buzz about this great spot! Right down the block from the Mile End library and YMCA, La Tasse Gamine is a cozy, welcoming space for parents and their little'uns of any age to come play and grab a bite to eat. The whole spot is designed with kids in mind, and the spot is sure to be overrun with kids most of the time, so I *do not* recommend coming here if you don't have a wee one in tow, but if you are one of those foolhardy parents (guilty as charged) who is looking for a place to escape the cold (or heat, when the weather turns) and entertain the tots for a while...check it out!  There's a spot for stroller parking outside, and for a relatively small restaurant, lots of space for running kids inside. There are two play areas with solid wall enclosures, one for bigger kids and one for babies, and each is packed with toys. Blocks, trucks, dolls, strollers, chairs, kitchen playthings, bead mazes...that's just what I noticed my 2-year-old get his hands on. There are also cozy couches in the back (where it's a little quieter), and a bookshelf full of classics. Or, stop by the library on the way over and bring some new favorites.   The restrooms are fully equipped with padded changing pads and potty seats. I'm big on changing tables, so this definitely earns extra points, although in a place like this I'm guessing it's a no-brainer. Speaking of no-brainers, the place is incredibly breastfeeding friendly.   And food! There's a full kids' menu, with choices like grilled cheese, lentil soup, quesadilla, hummous plate, fruit salad. Kids' options are around $4. For adults, there's quiche, grilled veggie wraps, spinach waffles (I think?)...all in the $6-7 range, and come with a little salad on the side. They also serve muffins/pastries and coffee (espresso drinks, not filter, and they don't always have cream, if that matters to you). Vegetarian fare all around. The menu could be more copious, and the service was lagging (because a bowl of lentil soup for a hungry toddler shouldn't take that long), but it was clearly a one-woman operation, which I give her a lot of credit for.  One note - if you're ordering less than $7 worth of food, there's an extra fee for using the space ($2.50, I think?). It's totally worth it - your kid will love it here. Most people I saw were moms on \"mommy dates,\" catching up with friends who also had kids, and appreciating the chance to talk without worrying about their house getting destroyed or their kids running into the street. I was flying solo (or, semi-solo, as I obviously had my toddler) and wished I'd brought a book, because he was *so* entertained by the other kids and the toys that I really could have kicked back and relaxed for a good half hour or more. If you're childless, you may not understand what a big deal that is. Or how valuable.  They have some craft activities and special events on their facebook page, but my kid's idea of crafts is eating glue, so we're not in that demographic yet, but I'm so glad I found this place - it's great!"}
