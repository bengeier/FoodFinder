{"text":"Absolutely brutal service. How can a beer take 10 minutes when you're sitting 6 feet from the bar and it's not even that busy. Were they changing the keg? Waiting on clean glassware? Our server was nowhere to be found in that time to find out.  All the servers and managers were running around flirting with each other instead of doing their jobs.   Not even kidding, every staff member we encountered seemed like they were either drunk or on drugs. Really, really strange.  Food was ok, nothing amazing. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Although my summer job internship is located in a building quite close to Ceili's, I certainly will not be returning here anytime soon.  I decided to make a visit here with a group of friends for some drinks and dinner after work.  I was terribly and unfortunately excited as I really needed a \"stress\" drink, wanted to catch up with friends, and because I heard raving things about the pub.  Unfortunately, it was such a terrible experience, that I wish I could give this review no stars.  Although I have no issue with noisy pubs, I do agree with Victor that on a Friday night, it was ridiculously loud.  I my as well have went to a dance club as the music was literally droning from being so loud I couldn't even hear my friend that I was sitting beside.  It took nearly 30 minutes for our server to arrive, where I found her to be extremely unprofessional and came off as being snooty and bitchy.  It was a party of 10 people who obviously are going to be ordering different drinks AND different meals.  Not only did she miss 4 people after the initial ordering, she also had to return to our table nearly 5 times to ensure that all the orders were correct.  I don't want to be mean, but perhaps there are things called pens and pads of paper that can be used?????  Originally I ordered a veggie burger....I don't know how she got it mixed up, but I guess \"veggie burger\" sounds like \"veggie dip\".  In other words, I did not receive a burger-like creation for $13.00, but rather a plate with 10 sticks of celery and carrots for a flipping $10.00.  I politely told her that the order was wrong, I wouldn't have gotten as angry if she put in an apology, but she had to get into biotch mode and create a wonderful response of: \"oh, well you'll have to make do with it as its too late to return the order.\"  That pissed me off where I would have loved to have jumped over the table and perform a ninja kick to the face of our server; but to avoid embarrassment to my friends I hunkered down and ate my veggie platter that I could have ate at home for free.  It was a terribly disappointing experience where the overall night at Ceili's had service that was incredibly slow.  Not only did we walk out with blistering headaches, but also with scratching sore throats from shouting across the table to \"talk\".  Not a fun night, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely a place sculpted to a specific demographic. If you are a part of this demographic, realize that my two star rating translates to four stars for you and your ilk.      To paraphrase H. S Thompson, this place is a fucking reptile zoo -- and someone's giving booze to these fiends. It won't be long before they tear us to shreds.      Go here, throw down some cash for booze, and watch the event. Especially on a Friday. Pure primate ethology in terms of what you get to assess 'in the field', for research. Pair bonding. Bio-survival responses. Dominance/submission dynamic regarding territory. Semantic 'time-binding' complexes as employed in order to gain/reaffirm the last three mentioned states. Sex/morality imprints. You name it. This place lets you observe Leary's first four circuits of the VIII circuit model of personality development. That alone is worth two stars! Enjoy, but bring your temper... patience will go a long way at this joint."}
{"text":"I went to Ceili's for their grand re-opening on the 14th of September. What stands out is the unbelievable noise levels. The crowd would be a typical busy night and one could not even hear the music over the roar of the crowd.  I did not each much, it was the excess salt that did it. I had a few of the hot shrimp hors d'ouvres that were served that were incredibly salty, kind of like salt cod. I sampled the stew which was quite well prepared but overshadowed by too much salt. However, the service was absolutely superbe which is why they barely get three stars; two and a half would be more like it. Ceili's, throw out the salt barrels in your kitchen.  The only seating options are stools, uncomfortable stools at that. It may be fine for a young crowd but an old goat like me could feel his joints creaking after about 45 minutes. My feet felt like I had run a marathon by the time I left. It was nothing a few Aspirin tablets could not cure when I got home.  It is not a place I  would return to as it does not present the atmosphere I am looking for but it seems to be a natural place to hang out for younger oil and gas employees looking for good beer at lunch and after work. I can see it as a good place for business networking if the acoustics were improved but I could not hear what the person next to me was even saying.  I am neutral here. I cannot recommend Ceili's nor can I state it is a place you should not try. It lacks warmth but it is not overly cold either. Mundane would be a good description. It is just another downtown bar."}
{"text":"Very salty tuna main. After two bites, I couldn't eat anymore. The waitress asked if everything was ok. After saying it was way too salty she took the food away. I still got billed for it. Quite bad service.  It was the first and last time eating there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here while in the neighborhood and looking for a pub to have supper at - and we're so glad we stopped by!  We had incredible service and the food was amazing (try their beef barley soup...just do it).  We spent several hours just talking and hanging out and were never rushed or hurried, and the waitress came by at all the right times.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Decent pub for a group of friends to have a few drinks and relax. There is live music, which makes this pub stand out."}
{"text":"Waitress was terrible, and food was overpriced. We brought a large group of people here for our friends going away party. Instant regret!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Innis & Gunn! They have the Whiskey version too which is pretty fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service is atrocious.  Waited 15min for our first round (there was 15 people in the bar including my 5 person party).  The waitress messed up our order 3 times.  2nd round took just as long.  To top it off we had to call our own cabs.  Never to return to any Ceilis!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place much more.  But truthfully, they need to learn what service is.  A group of 5 of us went on a Wednesday at 12:30. We did not have a reservation (for a later lunch didnt think we needed it but  I guess we did). They sat us at a table for 4 and brought a bar stool over for the 5th spot and kind of stuck it on a corner...the highest trafic corner. We rearraged it for them while they looked on.  They were slow to come back for drink orders. Once we did place the order, they were slow to come back with the drinks. One of us had the nerve to ask for lemon with her water. The server brought it  over on a cocktail napkin an kind of tossed it on the table. Um ok. She then took our food orders. After we all gave our orders we had to repeat them back to her, then her to us. Twice.  The food took about 30 minutes to arrive....beofre that happens most of the tables around us left and were cleaned. No one asked if we wanted to move to a larger table on either side of us. We did swap the bar stool out for a real chair (again they watched).  The food was good in my opinion (I had the braised short rib grilled cheese with the pepper fries). Some of my friends though found their burgers/sandwichs to be on stale, very crumbly buns which kidn of made for awkward eating, especially in crammed quarters. The server came back at the end of the meal to ask how everything was tasting...  The bills then took another long time to arrive. Then another  while before she showed up with the card machine. Oh and they don't take debit. Weird?? She had said it was no problem to do seperate bills but clearly her coworker who was waiting to use the card machine felt otherwise. She was throwing us glances and hovering while each of us made a payment, looking put out. Our server kept telling her she had more to do but the girl, looking angry, didnt budge.  The whole lunch took almost an hour and a half for basically what amounted to a few sandwiches and burger. And one salad. If you are going to be a downtown lunch spot and you are serving pub food, I'm thinking you could be faster. Or at least be nicer when you are being slow."}
{"text":"I'll be brief, an Irish Pub where they can't pour a pint of Guinness properly. If they can't get that much right..."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the staff are not too friendly at all. had to wait forever to place our order and they still got it wrong. the servers are rude and the Manager was slowly getting drunk flirting with the girls on a Wednesday night at 8pm.  I love Irish bars, i have seen many around North america but this specific one is just terrible."}
{"text":"We were with a big group. 25.  Flames burger was good. Drinks were slow.  Paid my bill waitress maid no mention of auto gratuity.  I just seen the machine to pay with the total.  I added a top.  She seen a double gratuity and just said thanks and ran.  No mention of my mistake and offer a refund of my error.  $11 tip on a 35 bill.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"It is a popular pub south of downtown Calgary. Has a pub feel with brick and dark wood but is quite open and not that big.  Servers wear the kilts.  Shift change is 3:00pm.  It has a few tv screen.  But it's loud, even in mid day unfortunately!!!  The health bowl was quite good with a variety of items in it.  Pints are not cheap starting at $7.25 and up.  Alright place but not that cosy and it has a downtown vibe which is a little detached.  Although it is a pub,  they seat you.  I seated myself and did not get a server so ordered from the bartender: go figure!"}
{"text":"First the good: Ceili's is a hopping place where you are likely to run into someone you know. It is full of people at all hours of the day and night. This visit was for a business lunch on a Friday. We arrived early and got a table without too much trouble. Ceili's works hard to make sure it is a fair process by not letting people hold tables unless they are staying there.  Now the bad....the service was HORRIBLE. Half our group arrived after the first part. When I finally waved the waitress down, she asked 2 of the newbies for their drink order, ignored the 3rd and didn't even glance at the rest of us (who now needed new drinks). She continued the less than stellar service throughout the meal.   The ugly...I ordered the $15 fish tacos. The description said it would have fish and prawns on the tacos. The plate that arrived looked delish. I picked up the first taco and took a bite. Yum....lettuce, cheese, hot sauce, tortilla. Um...where is the fish/shrimp? I took another bite....still nothing. I finally deconstructed all three tacos. Each had one shrimp cut into 3 pieces on it. Yep, that's right.....one shrimp PER TACO. Total of 3 shrimp on a $15 plate that does not come with a side dish. RIDICULOUS.  And before you ask....no I did not send it back/make a stink because I was hosting a customer lunch & that's just not what you do."}
{"text":"I spent St. Paddy's day here this year and I gotta say: I was left less than impressed.  Yes, they were completely slammed with patrons, but I still expect a decent level of service. No cigar.  The servers were snooty and careless and I just wasn't feelin' the vibe here.  This place was a total disappointment.  Never again."}
{"text":"I was here last week and I don't think I've ever had such dreadful service. I was meeting a friend only had about an hour, thinking this would be plenty of time as we were just getting wings. It started off alright, we ordered a drink and put our food orders in promptly - I ordered wings with ranch. A guy (not our server) brought our food and I again asked for ranch. My friend finished her food, still no ranch and empty drinks. I finally get up and go find our server, ask a third time if we can get dip, order another drink and ask for the bill. I explain that I need to leave and she half-apologizes saying that it got busy (it was not). By the time this finally all comes, I don't have time for my drink or to finish eating. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Are there twice while in town for work.  Great atmosphere and food selection.  I had Good burger with fries.  Both were very good.  Be prepared to wait 40 minutes at lunch time for your food.  Friday lunch is packed."}
{"text":"The beverages were fine, but the buns on the burgers were frozen-crumbly-crap not brioche as advertised. Fries were well-seasoned and tasty, but it was difficult to eat off of the little plastic serving boards they use instead of plates. Plates! We want plates! Oh, and I got food poisoning. So, yay me? My dining companion \"If those kilts were any shorter they'd be belts.\" Demeaning and tacky staff attire to say the least."}
{"text":"Ceili's came highly rated by some coworkers.  We went there for lunch one day.  I had the Bison Burger with house salad.  Very good burger.  I liked the distinct flavour of the burger.  The salad was a salad, they remembered my request for no dressing.  For some reason, downtown Calgary restaurants are overpriced.  There is fast food (cheap) and pricey food, but no moderately priced restaurants.  I could have had the same meal back home at Shoeless Joes for about $4 less  Ambience was good."}
{"text":"On a cold Feb early afternoon I went here with a colleague for a late lunch.  This is a classic faux Irish pub with an eclectic menu that goes from wings, one thai dish, fish tacos, nachos, blackened chicken, fried calamari, chicken tenders, veggies with hummus dip, amongst more normal pub fare.  How Irish is that?  Not.  An ok selection of beers, mostly very corporate mass produced beers.  Very cute waitresses in short kilt-like skirts.  My colleague ordered a hamburger which I know from exprience not to order in Alberta b/c the risk of contamination at the slaughter houses forces the lawyers to force the restaurants to cook the hamburgers to death, a dry tasteless death at that.  I warned him but he learned from experience just like I did.  I had a shepards pie which was just underwhelming.  Beer and babes are what they do well here."}
{"text":"Ok - I really dont understand the low stars -  I work across the road from Ceilis and go there frequently. I have also booked out part of the pub for a work event.   Ceilis is what you would expect from an Irish style pub - big bar, dark wood, bustling and fun. During the work week  you need to get there by 1130 1145 to get a table, it is that busy, but it is fun.   So I will start with the food - as a vegetarian there are a few options on the menu that I go for.  The stand out is the Kale and Quinoa salad with Agave Dressing - DELCIOUS. This is tossed with pumpkin seeds, black beans and feta cheese. I have had this many times and so have colleagues and we love it.  They also have a wonderful tomato bisque soup that is so tasty.  My friend often has the chicken pot pie which looks good - with puff pastry piled high on top - it would be great if they made a vegetarian version though as well.  Now the service is what I think really stands out. I was there yesterday and as usual we had a very cheerful and efficient server. I dont know what the management do to cultivate such a good energy with the staff, but across the board all the servers I have dealt with, and I have dealt with many - are friendly and fun.  Only weird thing to note- the washrooms are located down the hallway of a shared building - it feels like you are going the wrong way or something, somewhere you shouldnt be, but it is what it is.  All in al - Ceilis is a great place for lunch or dinner in a bustling neighbourhood downtown.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Good for a work lunch. I ordered a traditional burger with extta bacon and it was fine, I would call it average. The fries were crunchy and salted.   Princes are a little high for what I ate, but nothing crazy either.   I would recommend it as a place to eat of yoy dob't find anything else close to the place."}
{"text":"Hello Ceili's!  I wanted to publicly acknowledge how AWESOME Ceili's is to work with!  Last night (May 12, 2011), we had a charity event for the Enbridge Ride to Conquer Cancer.  We had six team members that needed to raise $15,000 in order to participate in theis event.  Ceili's provided the venue, ticket printing and three trays of natchos to our group.  Their staff were available and proactive in helping us with our event, and many of the staff even participated in purchasing draw tickets and such to help add to the sucess of the event.  I want to further acknowledge Matt and Carrie for being my points of contact leading up to the event.  They were always willing to answer questions and accommodate.  During the event, so many of the staff assisted and were available to us.  Thank you so much for the wait staff, bar staff and night managers that were efficient, friendly and proactive.  This was a huge win having this venue.  Its convenient for people to attend, since it is right downtown.  The band was an added bonus, to provide entertainment to the people participating.  Ceili's also not only allowed us to move furniture around to create auction tables, they even helped us do it!  (Wow!)  I know my last review was a five-star rating for Ceilis.  However, I just wanted to provide another 5-star update.  These guys \"get it\".  They give back to their community, work hard and are very custoemr service orientated.  Thanks Ceilis!"}
{"text":"Went to the southland location for the first time (AND THE LAST)  POOR SERVICE MEDIOCRE FOOD  RUDE EMPLOYEES  - Not to mention one of the huge meat-head bouncers beating up on some young guy half the size of him.. ( no one deserves a brual beating like that.. Especially AT A PUB) a place that people gather to eat have a few beers and want to have a good time!  Overall not a very good experience for a first timer and not at all interested in going back. EVER.   Good thing for places like LIMERICK'S where customers always feel welcome, never threated and you know the food is always good.. and on time! Cheers ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and an appetizer after work.  Ceili's is conveniently located downtown near many different business towers. Every time I have been there it has been quite busy with a friendly atmosphere. The wait staff is always friendly and provides good service. The food is general pub quality with the exception of the mac and cheese sticks. They're a heart attack in a stick but they are very delicious. Unfortunately I can only give Ceili's 3 stars because of the last time I was there I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was terrible. I will be back but I definitely won't order that sandwich again.  Food and drinks of all kinds with a good atmosphere but don't get the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"On a Friday night after work around 5:30PM, it was so noisy, I could barely hear my colleagues just a few inches away. If you don't mind LOUD and can avoid shouting yourself hoarse to carry on a conversation, go for it. There are quieter (but still lively) places to enjoy a pint or two with friends, with live music that doesn't make your skull throb in a not so good way. I wanted to like this place, but I just could not give it more stars, knowing there are other pubs in town. Maybe I'm just gettin' old. :D"}
{"text":"Excellent food, beverages and service, the servers are all really good and always have a smile on. I highly recommend this pub, even if it is a short visit it's always enjoyed."}
{"text":"Had a few drinks and food after work yesterday.  Made reservations on line and despite having extra people we were happily accommodated.  Excellent service. Best chicken wings I've had in a long time!!!!!! Buffalo coating with a hint of heat and a side ofdressing. Highly recommend them. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I loved the patio of the old Ceili's, which is why this one is a bit of disappointment for me. I agree with Chad's assessment that Ceili's is good on Monday nights, even though I can't honestly claim to have been down for Industry night since it was happening at the old location.  It's not so bad. I've had a few good experiences here, in large part because the bar seems to encourage a lot of mingling. A friends going away party had us take up about half of the bar, and there was a lot of getting-to-know-you from the different circles. The waitresses were fun and friendly and super fast with drinks, and eventually that gathering devolved into a (pretty fun) mess.  Another time I was out with just a couple of friends, and it was fun. Again, lot's of mingling, in part because we were the only young females in the bar who weren't serving. We started talking to the wrong people, and ended up in some sort of bouncer afterparty that was going on afterhours at Ceili's. It was pretty scary getting out of that one. That time, the service was pretty mediocre. Overall I feel that it is a decent place to mix and mingle - I 'd use it for an office party, but I otherwise have no interest in checking it out further. The seedy underbelly of the bar has definitely sketched me out."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but my waitress sucks.  I've never had a bad experience here but this time is wired"}
{"text":"So sad to see this degrading sign outside Ceili's which was one of my favorite places to go for birthdays.  While the food is good I just cannot support a place that sells the women who work hard there.  As well as women waitresses have a hard time with drunken men trying to grope them Ceili's is encouraging sexual harassment and the objectification of women.  These kinds of signs are disgusting.  Sadly some of the women working here may find this humorous but they don't realize that it is a blow to their self respect and dignity."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Ceili's since they changed their menu. However, a quick bite to eat turned out to be quite expensive. The service was quite slow, but the food was tasty. I had the haddock and chips, and my friend had the classic burger with onion rings.   The burger was incredibly juicy, and the fish and chips were crispy and hot inside and out. Unfortunately, it came without malt vinegar. When I requested some, it didn't come in a bottle, but in a small serving dish.  The bill was a shock. $56 for a burger, fish and chips, malt vinegar ($1.00) and pop (apparently there are no free refills). Having eaten here before, I had never been charged for refills.  Would I come back? Not sure.   It took about 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, another 10 - 15 minutes to get a coke. Food took forever to arrive and I am not sure where the serving staff had to go to find malt vinegar. That took another 10 - 15 minutes while my fish cooled on the table.  Was offered a refill, but my glass and the server disappeared for most of the meal.  Suggestion: Drink water or alcohol, skip the pop. Be prepared to spend some time waiting. Bring your own malt vinegar if you're going to have the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Pretty good service, nice ambiance. A little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Excellent food but the server was really rude often interrupting us with no regard for our conversations. I wouldn't go back there again. Our meal came and we still had no cutlery after asking for it earlier. The atmosphere is pretty busy lunches for downtown but likely more so out of convenience."}
{"text":"I've never had great service here bit usually the wait staff is accommodating and nice. But I went tonight and had a pop which was 4$, but beyond that since that's on me. I played cash rather than pulling out a card for such a small amount I had my change stashed on the table 4.50 in loonies and quarters and wanting to give a bit more I added .50 in dimes and nickles since that's all I have. Then she told me they don't accept anything under .25. Which confused me, I'm pretty sure you have to take legal tender."}
{"text":"I can't even believe this place is open. First and last time there.   Went for lunch on Wednesday.  1 - was seated in 2 minutes - yay 2 - didn't get acknowledgment from a waitress for 20 - boo 3 - didn't get a drink order for 15 more - boo 4 - didn't get a food order for 20 more - boo 5 - ordered and 20 mins later was advised what I ordered (veggie burger) had been out for a month. Wow, a month and you didn't know that???? Scratch it from the menu.  6 - my mom ordered a chicken salad...the chicken had been pre-cooked and then re-heated...was a piece of rubber 7 - I ended up ordering the veggie plate - pulling expired veggies out of a bin and throwing them on a plate does not equate to charging over $10 8 - caesar was fine 9 - they didn't know what a green apple martini was - holy crap 10 - couldn't discount on anything as they \"can't do that\"  After looking around, most people had only ordered drinks (downtown at lunch??? Alcoholica) or some form of baked, cheese, heart attack that can be easily thrown under a microwave and a salamander to heat up.   Puke. Never again."}
{"text":"Other than the cute waitresses, this place is not all that great.  I was here for lunch and the food was highly mediocre.  However, I will say that unlike a lot of the reviews, I felt our server was friendly and prompt and didnt have any issues with the service.  It is just that the food was not great. If you are just coming in for a drink, I guess it would be fine.  It maybe deserves a 2.5. If they made minor improvements to the food they might get a 3."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Waited forever to actually order. The server was fairly friendly, if not slow and inattentive. Then to top things off, someone sitting at the next table ordered the same thing I did earlier, waited far less than I did for my food, and the manager told him his food would be comped. I guess Ceili's in Calgary is synonymous with terrible service, regardless of location. Shame on me for giving this location a chance when other locations let me down so much.   It wasn't all bad. I had the Shepherds Pie, and it was actually quite good. Very hot when it arrived. The salad along with it was good as well. Not a typical house salad, with an interesting vinaigrette dressing. Asking about the salad was about the only time the server spoke more than two words.  Unfortunately the food wasn't enough to make me want to come back. I will continue trying more places as I explore downtown! But someone kick me if I try Ceili's on 4th."}
{"text":"You know what's awesome?!  Lobster night!  You know what's not awesome?  When you go to Ceili's expecting to receive the lobster dinner you were promised but never get it.  My boyfriend won a contest through Ceili's that said him and five friends could enjoy a free lobster dinner on the house on a certain night.  Well, we gathered our friends and went on that certain night, but didn't get our lobsters.  Apparently they had run out of the lobster.  WHAT?!  How do you run out of lobster when you know how many you're supposed to be serving on lobster night.    Luckily enough, we were told to come back another night and we would certainly get our meal.  So, we did that and we did get our lobster.  It was cold and tiny and definitely didn't satisfy the six of us.  If we were paying for our meal, well, we would have been pissed.  It was the worst two dinner experiences I've ever had and we received no consolation whatsoever for it.  Those experiences alone are enough to make me not want to go back.  First no food, then cold bad food.  Boo!  I want good, fresh food when I go out.  Not the leftovers that the kitchen has."}
{"text":"Beautiful waitresses and great atmosphere and good selection of drinks. When in Calgary, this is a great place for a good brew!"}
