{"text":"I absolutely love the food here.  In my opinion it is much better than Azan Wok down the road. However they do tell you that your food will take 20 minutes even if they know it will take an hour.  Now I will have to get over the Great Wall because it has gone out of business."}
{"text":"Murrysville/plum-If you need some chinese for the sunday game, or a good quality take out meal to end the weekend this place fits the bill. The general tsos is big chunks of white meat and has been crispy on the outside on most visits.   The pork lo mein combination platter is what the doctor prescribes for most lazy sundays.  Is it authentic? no.  Is it 5 star quality? No.  By hey \"I'm a fan\""}
{"text":"The two star rating is described by Yelp as \"Meh\" and that is exactly how I felt about this place.  I live in Plum and was craving Chinese, so as I drove past the plaza, I figured I'd give it a try since it is on my way home.  I placed my order and was told the typical Chinese restaurant \"ten minutes\"  I came back 15 minutes later and it was clear they hadn't even started on my meal.  Quite honestly, I think they forgot about it since it did not appear that they were very busy at the time.   The cashier was also very rude.  The food was decent, but not nearly as good as Azon Wok up the street.  I tried the hot and sour soup and the kung po chicken.  The soup was decent, but didn't really have much of the kick that I enjoy in hot and sour.  The chicken in my kung po was very dry and there wasn't much of it.  Also, I'm used to getting water chestnuts in this particular dish and there were none.   Overall, not a horrible experience, but it will likely be my last stop at this particular place."}
