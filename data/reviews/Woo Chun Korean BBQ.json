{"text":"We happened upon this place when we got lost trying to find an out-of-business Thai restaurant. What a happy accident! We came here, six of us, including two Korean sisters, who declared the food better than the best of K-town in New York City. Though I'm not Korean, I agree. Possibly the best jap chae I've ever had, divine banchan, and delicious, homemade-tasting everything else. This sleeper is a gem."}
{"text":"Truly an authentic Korean restaurant.  The scallion pancake was crispy on the outside, stuffed with scallion on the inside.  The hot stone seafood bibimbap was excellent as well.  Good service."}
{"text":"Excellent.  

Employee/owner was very nice.

Food and quality were very good.

Will go back and try more - for sure!"}
{"text":"So satisfying! Mother in law declared she liked it better than what we had the previous night... Wynn Buffet"}
{"text":"there is no such restaurant.  for a visitor, walking under hot  100 degree weather, no yelp update, what a trip.

do not look for this non existent restaurant"}
{"text":"This is as authentic as Koreans can get. The food is DELICIOUS! The portions are great, the side dishes are AWSOME, a definite must visit when in town!"}
{"text":"We came here because JinMee BBQ closed down, and we're so glad that we tried WooChon. By far the best Korean food I've had in Las Vegas!! All of the dishes we ordered were so good and did not disappoint. The Clam soup was refreshing, their Soybean Paste soup was amazing, the Seafood Noodle (jjamppong) was refreshing and tasty. This is a smaller, quaint place and the owner is very nice and attentive. You should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is truly the best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas....I should know since I'm Korean-American and I've lived in NYC, NJ and eaten in LA, home of the best Korean food in the US.  I will definitely seek Woo Chun out again when I return to Las Vegas. The owners, a couple, are so nice, friendly yet modest. The food tastes homemade, as if my momma made it for me. The seafood pajun is crunchy on the outside and stuffed with tasty seafood. The bibimbap is delicious with large slices of beef, not ground beef. The bantam (free appetizers) are also so tasty.  Definitely check it out...you won't be disappointed."}
