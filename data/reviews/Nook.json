{"text":"Working one building over, Nook is extremely close by and convenient, especially on a crazy busy day in the office where a lunch time stroll is not an option. All the sandwiches, pastries, soups and salads I've tried are fresh and delicious. Their breakfast options are also quick and satisfying on mornings where I'm rushing to catch a morning meeting. The dining area is nice and cozy. The price can be a couple bucks more than a chain sandwich place like Subway or Quiznos, but the variety and convenience is worth the premium. And based on the lunchtime line ups, I suspect many office workers in the vicinity would agree."}
{"text":"I don't know where these guys are from but they made the worst bimbimbap i've ever tasted - How and why is this item on their daily specials?  Unseasoned ground beef and NO toppings? You would think something like this was made by someone who doesn't know what its suppose to taste like, but they are Korean! Will never go back and they couldn't convince me to eat it if they paid me.

Worst $10 i've ever spent"}
{"text":"The only reason people come here is because it is local, and cheap. If there was a competitor close by this place would be out of business.

To start off, the people who work here are really nice. As mentioned it is also very cheap. However, the quality of the food is terrible. 

They toast the sandwiches and the bread goes so hard it feels like glass is stabbing the roof of your mouth. I am not joking.

I had the chicken pot pie today (ordered on Ritual so I didn't know what it looked like) and it was the most disgusting, frozen style pie you could imagine. I have never had a worse pie, it was a disgrace. 

The shepherds pie is a running joke in the office: \"hey, did you get any meat with your potatoes?\", although it doesn't actually taste that bad. It comes with a side salad with a sweet, sickly balsamic dressing (balsamic vinegar and shepherds pie?!) The pie is also not lamb (or mutton) - BTW technically shepherds pie is with lamb, and cottage pie is with beef.

The coffee is probably the worst I've tasted in Toronto and I've tasted a lot of bad coffee.

Honestly, spend the couple of dollars more and go to Zoes, What a bagel or ANYTHING else."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week and it is consistently good. The staff is a little hurried, but friendly. The sandwiches are always very good and the same can be said for their daily specials. 

I love taking people to this little place."}
{"text":"Favourite lunch spot ever. Panini's are so delicious. Must try! Really cute place too."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch and ordered the Tuscan Turkey Club with two sides, Curry Bowtie and Gala Apple Salad + Udon Salad. The sides were a little small but the portion of the sandwich made up for it. The food was decent for $10, the one complaint I do have is that they over toasted the sandwich to the point where had very thick black grill marks. Not sure if that's how are making it for everyone but, I definitely would've preferred it to be lightly toasted instead."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered a meal combo and coffee from an app, the coffee was not there when I went to pick up the food. The made the coffee for me after, but it did took a while since there were many people waiting in line. When I returned to the office, I noticed that one of the sides was wrong. My fish panini sandwich was great though, and the portion was pretty filling. For the coffee I ordered (Americano), I have to say it doesn't taste good at all. 

I decided to try it again today, basically ordered the same thing from my app. This time, they ran out of a side I wanted, so they let me choose another one. That's totally fine, yet the panini bread was overly grilled and half of it was really dark. I still like the sauce and everything in that sandwich, but had to toss out part of the bread because it was dark and bitter.

Overall, I think there sandwich is good value & taste if properly made. Coffee? Just get one from somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I work around the area and some co-workers recommended I try them out for lunch. 5/5 stars!!! They have delicious grilled panini's (veggie, chicken, melts). They have different salads everyday which are creative and innovative. Their soups must be home-made because they're so tasty ! Wooo Their customer service is fast and friendly. Try Nook out and you will not regret it. They leave you wanted more! yum!!!"}
{"text":"One of the fresher take-out places on King West, Nook is a reliable lunch spot with basic sandwiches and respectable side dishes. A sandwich combo with two small side servings like root veggies and rotini will set you back $10. The lines can be long during lunch rush but the service by kindly Asian ladies is quick and straightforward.

Definitely a lunch favourite."}
{"text":"I used to work across the street and would have their food everyday for lunch.  You can work through their entire menu within a few weeks but their food is fresh, healthy and delicious.  Who can ask more for a healthy lunch at work?

Favorites include the pesto chicken sandwich, roast beef sandwich, potato chive salad, salmon poppy seed bagel, and banana cinnamon crunch.

The people there are extremely friendly and kind-hearted.  Definitely a pleasurable experience getting food from happy service every working day."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out lunch from here a handful of times. I usually get their lunch combo, which is a grilled panini with two sides, which are interesting salad combinations. My favourites are the spicy fish panini & spicy pork kimchi. Both panini and salads are full of flavour. My only complaint is that sometimes the bread is slightly over toasted. Otherwise, it's great. Also, it's a relatively inexpensive lunch option for the King W area - win!"}
{"text":"Love this place, everything from the name to the food. The owner is always running the cash and you can see the joy he gets from people coming to eat at his establishment. The variety every day for the sides is a great selection. Just a perfect lunch place with great options. I usually get the guac + chicken or the Spicy Chicken - delicious.

*I will add one thing though. While the food is great, a LOT of people in my office including reviewers below have brought up that the sandwiches are toasted so much that the roof of your mouth will get scraped up if not careful. It's gotten better but I do recall this happening to me a couple times."}
{"text":"If you work on King St. West you need to take a moment to stop into Nook. You may have passed it a bunch of times, but trust me - take a moment to peak in. Nook is perfect for a quick lunch bite or a hearty sandwich/soup. 

Tons of seating, pretty affordable, and quick :)"}
{"text":"\"The bright green stand-up sign is visible from King as well as ever-present awning making a difference for the otherwise tucked-in cafe. Even with their clean signage, we're not too sure we would have simply stumbled upon Nook when looking for lunch. This is where word-of-mouth makes all the difference. Everyone seems to know about Nook, and recommends it.\"
\"Nook specializes in panini sandwiches. There are plenty of them - chicken, turkey based as well as tuna and veggies. The best part of ordering a panini is that a combo gives you an option of their daily soup side or two salads side.\"
\"I must note, if you have a sweet tooth, they also make plenty of pastries. I personally am a big fan of their brownie - not too sweet, very chocolaty and filling, with a great moist texture.\"

Just a few bite of our full review."}
{"text":"Formerly Bakerberry's, The Nook is a great little lunch spot tucked away and hidden down a set of stairs off King Street West. You might miss it but just look for the bright green sign and head on down, you'll be glad you did. 

In an area saturated with lunch places to please the King West work crowd, Nook truly stands out. They have really, really great soup, sandwich and salad combos. Their grilled ham, pineapple and cheese panini that was absolutely mouth-watering. Their soups, all of the creamed varieties are also very delicious and on a cold winter day, nothing beats it. 

The place is busy, probably because of the great prices and tasty food. Come here early during the work week for lunch and make sure to try a sandwich - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I remember seeing Nook on Restaurant Makeover and never had a desire to really go based on what I saw in the show - but it seems neither did a lot of others! I was finally dragged into going by my brother's curiosity and lo-and-behold it's actually not that Nook I had seen on TV at all!

This Nook (while keeping the look and feel) is now owned by a Korean family and aside from their panini's, they serve Korean style lunch servings (lots of sides). Much like Est West, you have a range of sides to choose from (Kimchi, Green beans, pasta, etc) and a wide variety of soups and panini's.

Their food is pretty good for the standard $10 lunch price and they have a pretty good panini selection. Aside from a few service hiccups I'd say this is a pretty solid lunch spot on the King West line!"}
{"text":"After becoming an crafty sandwich eater, I always look to find places with creative choices and fancy options... we almost missed nook but saw a bunch of people coming out with take-out boxes, so we stumbled in.... the place was boiling in heat, but the menu options were plentiful so we stayed.
Between my bff and i, we shared a chicken guacamole panini with 2 side salads - quinoa and red cabbage.
There were large cookies available but i saved my appetite for Mystic muffin *thumbs up*

The place was really cute, with a side banquette, and small side tables and a bar top to look up onto King street.
The sandwich did its justice with  a good panini bread, and loaded with flavours within..... the salads however was a bit of a disappointment.
I consider quinoa to be soft and chewy, not hard and grainy.... so much for getting my bff's hopes up. The cabbage salad was just that - cabbage, with a a fig dressing that didn't taste anything like fig.
Still a good lunch but there seems to be way more rustic sandwich places on the street to explore."}
{"text":"Nice lunch place. Clean and simple look. Went there once and had lasagne and mixed greens. It was the special of the day. Tastes ok for a $10 lunch. Would definitely go back for some panini."}
{"text":"I've had Nook cater for work events (thru Platterz) and their sandwiches are always a hit with colleagues and clients esp the Chicken w/ Avocado and the Greek salad. Presentation is very professional too:)"}
{"text":"I came in a little later after the lunch rush, sides were running a little low. Ordered the buttered chicken panini and to my surprise it was not bad! Could use some more flavour though. Don't bother ordering the smoothie, fruits are frozen and they put only one scoop of yogurt."}
{"text":"This is really cute little place with exposed brick walls that's great for a quick sit down lunch.  I've been a few times as I work close by but, to be honest, I don't think the sandwiches are all that and I've tried a few different ones.  I find them to be very dry and light on the fillings and spreads, especially the cheeses - I always walk out feeling a little ripped-off.  I've never had the soups or salads so I can't comment but, as I said, the sandwiches are pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Has to be one of my favourite lunch spots and is truly a little nook! Love their paninis and tomato soup. Gets really busy around noon so I recommend using the Ritual app."}
{"text":"Love love this place! 
If you're looking for a quick and cheap lunch, look no further! 
Run by a Korean family in a small little basement spot along king st, Nook offers a variety of panini sandwiches along with sides and soups.
Seeing that I live and work closeby, I've been to Nook several times and it never fails to impress me. 
My go-to is the honey kimchi pork sandwich and the macaroni side. Delish!! 
They grill the panini to utter perfection and the macaroni has a slight sweetness to cut the spicy sour taste of the kimchi. 
For under $10, this is THE lunch spot on king st. 
not to mention the service is always fantastic. 
Keep it up Nook! See you tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"They have a lot of variety and I am dying to try the meatloaf sandwich.  I've had a variety of their chicken sandwiches including the tuscan and spicy and the chicken is of decent quality.  Maybe I'm being naïve but I think they carve it themselves.  They have a nice assortment of pastas and salads with your choice of 2 for a nice lunch around $8.  Had the split pea soup - quite tasty.  Definitely worth a try for the King/Queen West crowd."}
