{"text":"Went there using a groupon and was surprised at the quality and courtesy of the staff. Why? Many places issued grouping and then treat you badly ..

Their appetizer was good and main course was tasty. The food was fresh. We had Tuna, braised short rigs, tenderloin and salmon. 
They were all cooked and plated well.. 

Their bread selection was food and the servers were generous about refilling. 
The funny thing was that they used  a 3 ft long pepper mill ...it was quite hilarious 

The surrounding was gorgeous and the servers waited for us to come back from the garden to serve our desserts. Their selection of tea was high end ..they used tea forte instead of a cheap selection. 

We had one tasty desserts , from cheesecake, tarts etc. it was delicious 

I will go back there"}
{"text":"I would like to share our great experience at this wonderful place! We came to TDH on Friday night, made a reservation before. There were 4 of us. We were accomodated at the table facing a garden with a gazebo - what a lovely view! The place is recently  renovated and looks fantastic! They must had hired a good designer - combination of wood and stone along with a modern touches is really amazing. Food and drinks were great as well. We ordered MW steak, that was cooked perfectly! Service was attentive and timely. My friends had some questions about their menu items, so our waiter was knowledgeable enough to make a suggestions that left us happy.
Definitely a place to go! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going here for a while as I had heard good things. 
its a bit of a hike from Toronto but when we arrived all signs were pointing to this being a unique experience. Nestled near a small idealic village centre this unique structure didn't disappoint at first appearance. Then we sat down for dinner and things didn't go as well.

Dinner was fine. And thats the best I can say. I was underwealmed by the food. It all sounded good and looked good, but tasted...well fine. But frankly nothing special whatsoever. 

The review would have been a 3 star if not for the fact that for most of the night my wife and I had to listen to the hostess talk to someone else who appeared to \"work\" about the inappropriate details of her love love and social life. It was like having MTV shows like teen mom playing in the background over dinner. #fail."}
{"text":"When we went into the main entrance, a waiter passed by us already started to greet us. He was actually walking into the banquet room. At the entrance of the banquet room, we were once again greeted by another staff. I told him that we had a booking. He politely asked us to wait a bit and had another waiter led us to the covered porch area of the banquet hall. It is a nice area that there are a lot of patio doors around the whole porch. The trees and shrubs in the garden outside the porch area are lighted up. It is very beautiful especially the maple leaves turn yellow and red. The area is warm and there is no chill air from the doors. The waiter helped us to be seated. It is a mark of a high end restaurant.

The Soup of the Day was Leek with potatoes. When I first spooned, I found it to be very thick. But when I had it in my mouth, it felt just right. The texture is up to the point, not too thick and not too watery with an even blend of leek and potatoes. The crab cake was very crispy on the crust but not oily at all. It was served warm and with delicious taste of crab meat. The crab meat mixture was fresh. The pink Trout was seared only just a little bit over cooked. The Trout was of high quality topped over with tomatoes and other spices. It was a decent portion at least 6 to 8 inches in size. The medium rare Kleinburg Striploin was perfect. It was hard to cook this thick slice to such texture. The centre part of course was the best. The gravy was from the beef juice and was thick so cutting a piece of Striploin with the gravy sliced on top tasted perfect. We were all full but the waiter recommended the chocolate cake by his experience that finally we decided to try it out. We did not miss it. It turned out to be excellent. The chocolate cake was topped with an vanilla ice cream. It was so moist, smooth and baked that could liquefy together with the ice cream.

Both waiters were friendly, smiling all the time and asked us how we were doing. Although we were in the porch area separate from the main banquet hall, they were not hard to reach. There was live piano playing at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Their Sunday legendary brunch ... soooo overrated.   The surroundings outside are beautiful.   And if you are lucky enough to be seated in the sun room, as we were, lucky.  The main dining hall where the brunch sits is very dark and tightly packed with tables.  The seated guests on one side of the buffet I'm sure hated the fact that there was a continuous line of people walking past them. 

The brunch fare is, well, fair.    The lamb was grey and dry, the ribs were slathered in bbq sauce (not a very elegant way to eat a brunch item), and the pasta was overcooked with under seasoned sauce.  The bacon was not crispy, it was just a slice of fat sitting in the hot dish, and much of the salads were just, meh. 

For my table of 20, here were the highlights - seafood and desserts - that's the reason the review is 2.   If the cost was nowhere close to $60 per person, WITHOUT ALCOHOL , the review would have been higher, but the food cannot be average when the cost is so high."}
{"text":"Despicable place! Took literally 30min for the server to bring us water and take our orders. Besides, after a little while servers were disassembling carton boxes and rolling tables in the middle of the restaurant with a bunch of people having dinner! Not just one or two boxes or 1-2 tables...  an array of them!! Shame on Dr's House! Never again!!"}
{"text":"Had my wedding here and it was a wonderful experience. The staffs are very tentative and they accomandated all my needs. I booked the Great Room where it held more than 200 people for my party. And I have to mention the scenery is perfect for special occasion. It was beautiful no matter what time of day.

My family and friends were super happy with the bartenders and servers services. Special thanks to Ally and Christine who gave us good advice cater to our needs throughout our entire year of planning. It was overall a memorable event.

Thanks DH!"}
{"text":"Went here for a wedding reception recently. I'm writing this review with a background in hospitality and events. 

First off, this venue is beautiful. The grounds are nicely kept and there is an adorable little chapel outside. There's nice patio furniture outside to relax and hang out in and a fireplace to keep warm. 

With that being said, everything else is just meh. Our appetizer was an antipasto dish. One piece of prosciutto, a few melons, one piece of zucchini, one piece of eggplant, and some mushrooms. Presentation was lacking. It looked slapped together very quickly. Our pasta dish was penne a la vodka. That was good. Pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce had a good consistency. Now, the steak was an atrocity. New York striplion cooked literally all the way through. A beautiful cut of meat, butchered with no way to fix it. Let's be real here, you can't do anything with a well done steak. The plate was scorching hot to the touch, indicating that our food was kept in a food warmer for quite some time. Nobody at our table was pleased with our main course. My fiancé was the best man at the wedding and he said the head table's steak was cooked well. So I guess they put more thought into the bride and groom's food. I mean, if they're paying for the reception, they have to be wowed. 

Service was unorganized. People at our table were skipped when handing out plates and plates were cleared when we weren't done our food. We had a glass of champagne for each person at the table and the banquet servers cleared them off before any of us could have it. Coffee and tea station were not maintained. Bartenders were touching the lips of our glasses... there were a lot of things that could have gone better. 

The late night station was desserts, fruit, and cheeses. The desserts were lemon meringue pie, tarts, and cakes. The person serving the desserts had no idea what any of the desserts were. You can tell the desserts were quickly defrosted because they were super mushy on the outside and still frozen on the inside. 

Like I said. I am writing this review with a background in weddings and the like. I am a bit more picky than the average person because I know exactly what to look for. 

I just hope the bride and groom had a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"If this is the Doctor's house, let me marry into the medical field! Just kidding, I love my non-doctor fiancé to bits. And that was why we were here! Doctor's House came up multiple times in our search for the venue that was the one. And no, this wasn't THE CHOSEN ONE, but my was it lovely. It was the first place we went to that felt like a true contender. On top of that, the pricing was reasonable and the sales rep we worked with was fantastic (Allison). She was the only one we met up with that gave us a quote in the very same appointment. 

Doctor's House is located in picturesque Kleinburg. Where's Kleinburg? Drive north past the suburbs, past the small town, past the cow country, and suddenly you're in small town again. That's Kleinburg. It's quaint, it's quiet, and it's 100% wedding-y. You might miss this place at first because from the outside, it doesn't look like anything exceptional but inside is something else. 

First of all, ample parking. Oh my god, you don't really think this is an issue until you realize you've got dozens of cars angrily circling around looking for spots in the name of love. YOUR love. So yes, plus for parking. After that, the sales rep will take you into a series of plain looking hallways in that discreet white building. Plain, simple, boring hallways then SUDDENLY beautiful event room!  

There are several rooms, some that belong to the original House with high wooden beams and a beautiful rustic feel, e.g. The Heritage Room, The Garden Room. They tend to be much smaller. Then there are the newer areas like The Country Fare Room and the Main Room. The Country Fare room (seats max 150) looks out onto a garden path and gazebo outside. The gazebo would make for an amazing outdoor ceremony space, but it's only available if you book that particular room. The Main Hall is very deserving of its name. It's huge, bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows and an outdoor patio with a fireplace. I didn't even know I wanted an outdoor patio with a fireplace but in that moment, I did! 

Behind all that bright, beautiful, space is something really special: The Chapel. Even if you're not religious, it's just a lovely area to say \"I Do\". It's simple and easily dressed up. Between the Chapel and the main building is a garden that would make the best backdrop for wedding pictures. Unfortunately when I went, it was still winter, but just imagine if everything wasn't dead!

The Doctor's House has got the art of romance nailed down. It feels like a setting of a small town drama, where the kindhearted schoolteacher is marrying the handsome stable boy/farm guy. Now, I might not be a schoolteacher, but it was just so easy to see myself getting walked down the aisle in the Chapel that it was easily part of my Top 3 choices. All I can say is the doctor is in and it's time to get married!

{"text":"Took my husband here for his 25th birthday. Nice to get out of busy areas and drive along fields, even if it was just 20 minuted from my house.

We were greeted by a waiter who was there by himself, there was one table departing and another just ordering.

We were promptly seated by the window looking out into the back terrace, which was really nice.

As my husband sat down he kind of fumbled a bit because one of the chair legs gave way, luckily he stood up in time. The waiter explained that it was broken last week, and the owner keep putting it back out on the floor... :s not a great impression to start with.

BUT our waiter was funny, enjoyable, attentive and made us hold hands LOL 
He made up for the first impression very quickly. We ordered:

$31 antipasto
Came with bocconcini & tomatoes, grilled veggies, prosciutto, olives, mushroom, pickled vegetables. Huge platter, was delicious and was practically full afterwards. More than enough for two! Everything seemed very fresh.
Free bread came out, has poppy seeds on top and a glaze of olive oil/ Was ok.

$54 seafood for two
Came with 2 lobsters, 8 mussels, 2 tiger shrimps, 2 salmon filets, 2 tilapia filets! OMG everything was hot and fresh, our waiter came by and recommended we eat the lobster first since cold it becomes hard to remove from the shell (* nice of him). Also came with roasted potatoes and grilled asparagus, but we didn't touch those since we wanted to eat the seafood. Really full to the max after these two platters.

$11 house white
- Not very good house white, especially for $11, the waiter did give my hubby a smaller second glass for his birthday which was really nice of him.

Too Full for dessert but they did have cheesecake/tiramisu. Didn't feel rushed to leave after paying the bill, the waiter even shook our hands as we left.

Technically it should be a 3.75 star, but can't rate that so we bumped it up to 4 stars. 

Overall
Over priced except we had a voucher! 
Place is definitely more of a wedding venue, service and place settings all reflect that. 
Really nice environment, he buildings are white, there's a small chapel n the side, some construction going on. They really need to upgrade their decor, floors and furnishing because you can see it is long over used. This place is definitely not boasting when it isn't a wedding but is a nice alternative to other dining restaurants. 

We went with lower expectations because of other online reviews on how this place has gone downhill, luckily didn't meet with the blond manager everyone hates, but we did leave smiling."}
{"text":"I would overall give this place a 3.5 star for the food and service. The seating area and ambience was a 4 star. We came here based on all the positive reviews for this place and I think it was a bit over-rated for what it exactly was. The venue itself is beautiful, the chapel and the garden were kept in well groomed order. 

When I booked my reservation online, I received a confirmation but I called to add an additional individual and when I called, the male who answered the phone was outright rude. He alleged that I didn't have a reservation but would put me in now, I asked for the pricing per person, He said it plus tax and tip, of course I know that its pretty common sense but I still got poor service on the phone. Knock half a star off for the poor telephone etiquette.

We arrived a bit earlier than our reservations, I guess they were tight on each seating and had to make sure food was ready to serve. We were seated nearby the window and there was a party that booked more majority of the space we were in. 

The food was an \"A-Ok\" but nothing really popped as super delicious or bad. There was the meat station which included roast beef, lamb, porketta. There was also a waffle station and pasta station which we didn't really get to.

What I enjoyed the most was the seafood area with lobsters, crab legs and tiger shrimps. I mainly spent my time there and the antipasto appetizers.

All in all, I think this is a nice place to try out but for the price, I've experienced better food quality."}
{"text":"Attended a wedding here over the weekend. A great venue with great food (which is hard to find from my wedding attendance history) and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Attended a wedding, as the MC.

Lovely venue, lovely staff.

Sad to read some of the negative reviews of people that fancy themselves as knowing a single thing about food prep for groups larger than 5 people.

The appetizer was fine, it was pleasant with good quality ingredients, I will say placing a sliced   provolone on a salad is lazy. I dont need my food to look good, I need it to taste good and be easy enough to consume. 

Seems a standard for weddings these days is a Penne with rose sauce, as much I could live the rest of my life not having this again - theirs was better than average. I appreciate the attention to cooking the past just right.

The steak & stuffed chicken. First, this was a lovely dish, very appealing, not in the \"I am an annoying self described foodie so I am going to take pictures of it\" sort of way. But in the way that you want to dive in.

The steak, for the love of baby Jesus, people who expect a venue to serve pink/bloody steaks to a room full of people with opinions of how a steak should be cooked is just silly.

You've got to cook it. 

The complaints about this baffle me. The steak was excellent, sure it might have been cooked through. Mine, and the 2 to other side of me were pleased with the flavour of the steak. 

Somehow, likely by the grace of God, they were able to look past the texture they wouldn't normally order and appreciate the flavour.

Flavour still matters right? or is it just Instagram filters you need?

The chicken, great. I was too full to finish it.

The dessert was outrageously lovely. 

The staff, the bartenders, the front office staff were all great."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding on the last weekend of May for the reception. Love the look of this house. This venue is perfect for those who want that cozier and intimate environement. I love the pan of open windows all across the hall allowing a lot of natural light in! 

The patio is really cute just outside of the hall, it has a fireplace where you can choose to take group pictures or even just a cute couple picture :)

Food was pretty good. we had butternut squash soup which was quite delicious, the pasta was done properly and good texture. The steak and chicken combo i got... i found the steak was overcooked and too dry. my fiance's was done perfectly though. the chicken was a bit on the dry side, so entree was only okay. Dessert i loved the mini creme brulee (it was part of a trio). the tiramisu/coffee cake was great, but the cheesecake was way too heavy and sweet so I didn't eat it.

They had late night station as well after, but we didn't really eat the food since it was late, but my fiance did try some of their fries and thought it wasn't very good. 

The bar is quite good. They actually make a mean espresso! something I wasn't expecting but it went perfectly with my dessert. The guys are quite nice and friendly when ordering drinks and willing to work with whatever your preference is as long as they have the ingreidnets to make the drinks.

Food is 3 stars. drinks is 4 stars but the atmosphere I would give it 5 stars. So overall, 4 star rating. I would choose this venue for the look, the pictures and the atmosphere, not so much for food per se."}
{"text":"We visited the Dr's. House as I had purchased vouchers on a group website. After reading the fine print....I discovered that the voucher could not be used for their legendary brunch....dinner or lunch only. A bit of a disappointment but not the restaurants fault.

The restaurant itself is not as spectacular as I had hoped...it appeared to be a banquet hall with tables and chairs thrown in. The view, which overlooks the courtyard and church is fantastic. It is worth strolling the property to capture the true ambiance of this place.

Our waiter was a hoot. While speaking to him, we discovered that a member of our party was from the same home town as his parents (back in Italy) and through more conversations, it was discovered that they were related in some way !. Too funny ! Regardless, he was amazing. He made recommendations for our wine, recommended some entrees, entertained us with stories (without being obtrusive) and was just a warm and welcoming individual. 

Too bad the food didn't live up to his service skills. Our food was \" just OK\". Salad (Caesar, garden and goat cheese) were all excellent. Steak was a bit of a disappointment....not as flavourful as I had hoped. Chicken was very tasty, but again, nothing spectacular.

Wine was excellent, desserts OK.

If the dining room was more inviting, we would probably go back and give the place another try."}
{"text":"The Doctor's house is a pretty little gem that is worth the visit. I've been here twice so far. Both times the ambiance has been amazing, the food delicious, and the service relatively slow. 

This restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner for two. Or make that a family night out for five. My second time here I scored a coupon so we took advantage of it and ordered four appetizers, four mains, and four desserts. So worth it. 

Appetizers: 
The spinach salad is really good, the pepper crusted tuna on a bed of salad was nice though slightly over peppered, the marinated octopus was super tender and the taste was interesting but you have to like slimy seafood to dig this one, and the minestrone soup was standard fare. 

Mains:
The crispy cornish hen is absolutely delicious. Get it! The striploin is well flavoured and leaner than the tenderloin, while the tenderloin is obviously more tender. Get them medium rare. I found the medium to be slightly overdone for my liking but my mom loved it. The veal loin was a good size and very tender as well. all paired with a cucumber salad and potatoes. Good portion size, no tiny portions here! 

Desserts:
We tried the creme brulee, warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, NY cheesecake, and also the tiramisu. i would say all of the desserts were well made and delicious. Tiramisu was the fave among the group and it was not overly sweet. Creme brulee had a nice crunch on top and inside it was thick and creamy. 

Service is on the slower side but staff was wonderful. The site is very pretty overall, lots of weddings taken place here and for good reason. They even have an outdoor fireplace for after dinner drinks out on the patio."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on Fri night. Food was good but it's not what it used to be a few years ago. The service is very good and the ambiance is great. We went to Mac Michael's gallery and walked the grounds first and then went to Doctor's, se we were quite hungry. When we received the bill it was like \"Seinfeld's moment\": \"Did we eat all this?\" :-)
Anyway, the place is good but not great. The prices are expensive."}
{"text":"I went here for there open house night, since I am looking for venues for my upcoming wedding.

I was so blown away by how gorgeous the rooms were, even behind all the decorations, the place is just that beautiful. 

We saw all the rooms and there was plenty of rooms, all with a different feel and it's own story to tell, but none the less all so very beautiful (these are the kind of buildings and venues that make me wish I got into event planning).

They served food at the open house, and by golly the flavours and the taste were so very good. in shorter words, simple yet delightful. 

we sat with the sales associates to discuss pricing, and it may be pricey but I definitely loved the space. 

this place is something you just have to visit yourselves to see :)"}
{"text":"Disorganized service, will never return or recommend to anyone.
Save your money (even if you have a voucher) and go somewhere else.

SERVICE: 
We had dinner there yesterday to celebrate our 5yr anniversary. Had made a reservation over a month ago and requested a verandah seat if possible and told them it was for our anniversary. We were sure to arrive 10 min prior to our reservation time. The hostess was quick to seat us, however when I asked if indeed they were able to reserve a veranda table for us - the response I got was an annoyed \"yeah yeah\" and shake of the head.

Our waiter arrived shortly after we were seated and he right away asked, \"so have you decided, what do you want to order?\" No water or bread was brought to the table yet. Didn't even ask if we wanted wine or anything to drink. In the middle of writing down my dinner order turns back to the last table he was serving as he forgot a piece of paper at their table. 

Water glasses were filled and we had to repeated flag someone down for a refill...and we needed a couple of refills on account of the fact that we didn't receive our wine! After the appetizers arrived, then they brought us some bread for the table. Still no wine. When the main dishes arrived, we asked them what happened to our wine - still no wine.

Visible arguments between the serving staff about who was doing what. Couple of minutes go by - and they bring my husbands glass of wine. I ask where mine is, again apologies it's coming. It didn't. 1/3 of the way into my entree I just went to the closest staff I could find and told them to cancel my wine order - at this point it was useless. The response I got was the waiter was \"just getting it\".

My glass of wine arrived, apparently complimentary, just as we were eating dessert. 

The automatic 15% gratuity was charged on the bill. The waiter apologized at the end for the confusion and said that they didn't charge us for the coffee or tea...yet the numbers didn't add up as we were taxed and tip was calculated on it all.

BTW - the waiter was a little annoyed at the end that he brought me a complimentary \"premium\" glass of wine and I didn't even drink it!!! 

FOOD:

Bread for the table - the mini olive loafs were excellent, the other bread, stale and cold.
The food that we ordered was excellent. (We did hear a few muttering from other tables on the less than par shrimp cocktail and calamari).
Caesar salad and organic beet salad - both had just the perfect amount of dressing - light and flavourful. The beet salad especially - wonderful!
Our mains were the prime entrecôte and beef tenderloin - excellent! Perfectly done medium rare and medium as requested. Very flavourful and both matched perfect with their sides.
Left us quite full so we shared the home made chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Good moist cake, would've been better served warm instead of tepid with the ice cream just starting to melt - but this goes back to the disorganized service. Ice cream a little better that Chapmans from the grocery store would've been nice.

--------

Felt like it was a place that at one time was a great restaurant - most of the food still is - however has slowed down over the years. They took part in a TravelZoo voucher plan for more business - but management didn't staff the restaurant sufficiently to handle the volume and full house.

Through all the comedy of errors our anniversary wasn't spoiled though as I still had dinner with the love of my life...but The Doctor's House - NEVER again."}
{"text":"We used The Doctor's House for our ceremony and wedding reception. The day was spectacular. We had Zoe Mercer as our coordinator and she is wonderful. She is patient, responsive, and made the day run smoothly. We do not live in Toronto so it was great to work with her since she would email me back pretty much within an hour! or call me! 

The grounds and the venue are absolutely beautiful. We used the Heritage and Colony room upstairs. We used minimal decorations and everyone complimented us on how beautiful the venue is. What I liked about the Doctor's house was how easy they made things. We wanted a place that was intimate, romantic, and required minimal decorations to make the place beautiful since we were 'DIY' our wedding. They also have beautiful chairs and linens included in the package so you did not have to worry about renting chair covers or anything. 

The staff were attentive. The food was delicious and the portions are great value for money. Everyone was telling us how tasty and full they were! We had steak and salmon for dinner and they were both cooked deliciously. The mushroom soup started and risotto were delicious. The dessert was also amazing. it was a trio of creme brulee, tiramisu in a chocolate mold, and a cheese cake. Everything was plated beautifully. 

This place made our special day the best day of our lives."}
{"text":"Bought a dinner pkg from Groupon and was looking forward to going, but huge disappointment.  The service was not good and the food was horrible.  I complained to the manager that night and called the next day and they did not seem to care at all.  I guess that's why friends have told us since not to eat there."}
{"text":"Nice venue, friendly staff and some beautiful land. A fine spot to promise someone you will love them forever or at least until you drive each other into the arms of another. I mostly spent my time with the bartenders because open bar, right? There was an excellent outdoor area for those looking for some fresh air or a quiet place to inhale some not so fresh air (ie, cigarettes)."}
{"text":"I came here for a reception & wedding on the first Sunday of August. The backyard and garden are beautiful for pictures. I loved the look of the whole place - it is so cozy and intimate. inside the venue of the great hall it had nice view and lighting. It overlooks the garden and brought in natural sunlight during the day. I liked this venue over most other wedding venues I've attended. However, service and food were mediocre."}
