{"text":"Very Very Very good cupcakes. Came in today with my family and met the owner Tishonda. These are some of the best cupcakes I've tasted. Very rich and the sugar free cupcake was delicious. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I understand they are $2 a cupcake but these are the worst cupcake I have ever had they was totally dry not one cupcakes tasted like the flavor it was supposed to be i was totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Croissant was amazing!! Sandwich was great, next time no lettuce is was soggy. The cookie and brownie just okay. My mom makes them just as good if not better. I will try the cupcakes and see how that goes."}

I love that her cupcakes is fresh and she have a lot of different variety. My daughter is allergic to Gluten and Enchanted Cupcakes and More offer Gluten Free. You must try"}
{"text":"hello they use to be in surprise az   I whould go every   day to stop in to say hello what a great bunch of people"}
{"text":"Found this place online when I needed to send a last minute birthday wish to my grandma in AZ.  The Facebook response to my message was immediate after I had trouble getting through on the phone.  They were very helpful in picking out the perfect birthday cupcakes, they were delivered right on time and at no charge! (Since it was a local El Mirage delivery).  I would definitely use them again!  Thanks for making a special birthday delivery!"}
{"text":"Alright, A new cupcake place moved in the neighborhood. Our family tried a 6 pack. I had 2 flavors-Fruity Pebbles and Butterscotch. They seem to be like vanilla cake and the toppings are added in and on top. The cupcakes are smaller than the usual boutique cupcake sizes. They are about the same size you would make at home. BUT they are priced accordingly - Only $2 each not $4 and Up like other cupcake places. I really liked the taste of the 2 I tried. I am looking forward to trying their other goodies. I think they even serve breakfast and drinks."}
{"text":"Fantastic people and cupcakes, sign me up!   I found Enchanted Cupcakes and More at an expo, and although I'm a huge sweet-tooth, I'm also vegan, so I thought there was no way they would have something for me. But I was wrong! They even had vegan and gluten free options in stock there at the expo (as well as the normal stuff too), they were so prepared!   The cupcake itself was delicious. It was very moist, and the flavor was very rich without being overwhelming. To make a delicious cupcake even better, the ladies I met were friendly, personable, and people I really felt good buying from.  I highly recommend them, and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Another cupcake bakery fail! Called the number and the lady answers with just \"hello\" confused and dazed. The professionalism is out the door. Apparently this shop closed and it's a home ran business literally give them 24hrs to make and it'll be ready. If it's like that I might as well make my own cupcakes and have them ready within hours instead of a day. Why are\" businesses\" allowed to front on this app?"}
