{"text":"Great pizza place! We've been going here for years and I recommend the Bianca pizza with ricotta. The staff is very accommodating and the atmosphere is comfortable. Whether dining in or ordering to go it always good."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great staff, fun atmosphere. Best vegan pizza in town!  Special orders are accommodated with a smile. Even the dinner salad is a step above the standard iceberg lettuce fare at most pizza places. (You can even get vegan ranch dressing!)"}
{"text":"Defiantly one of my top pizza places now. The customer service was great, the atmosphere was very calm & homely. Pizza was delicious & the wings are well recommended the medium flavor has a extra kick couldn't figure out what the secret ingredient was. Prices were decent!"}
{"text":"Just found this place...Great food, great family atmosphere and great prices as well...We are from NYC and will probably be coming here 2-3 times a month...Finally a neighborhood, family run joint...for those of you who have negative reviews here, keep on going to your trendy, chain restaurants.  Don't bash those folks that know what a restaurant should be all about...the kid on the guitar tonight, we thought you were great..keep on doing your thing."}
{"text":"I love this place! All through high school I would come here on Friday afternoons. They have this amazing deal with two slices and a drink for something like $5. It's amazing! The pizza comes out hot and fresh and the staff always comes and chats with us for a while too! A large group of teen boys is not welcome with such open arms to many places but pizza heaven will always be my pizza home"}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN FOOD! Never knew Italian food could be made soooo good vegan. I'm waiting for them to make a lasagna.   I'm definitely bringing all my friends and family here.   Also the best customer service. The owner always wants you to leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Awesome Wings. Perfectly cooked, and nice and hot. Pizza was Brick oven cooked and all of their meats and ingredients are fresh made in house. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tawny is the worst server ever. I ordered a caprese salad, she had brought out the salad and then after i was finished eating my salad about 10 minutes later she comes out and says \" her is the bread for the caprese\". My friend ordered the penne pasta primavera and Tawny brought out the chicken parmigiana. When we brought it to her attention she questioned what my friend ordered as if he didnt know what he ordered and then after a few minutes came back and asked us to clarify. When she brought out the correct dish she apologized saying that a lot of the menu items start with \"P\". Who would of guessed at an italian restaurant. She didn't offer to take anything off the bill and made. no effort what so ever. Don't get me wrong I love this restaurant it has amazing food and Patricia the owner is a sweetheart. However Tawny has to go. She clearly has no idea what it means to be a server. I have served table and know exactly how to properly treat a customer."}
{"text":"I am vegan but have lots of non vegan friends. This is the place to go so that everyone is happy! The owner went to great lengths to make it great for vegans and meat eaters alike!! My fav is the vegan baked ziti with soy sausage!! All the pizzas are also excellent! Vegan cheese cake or angel bite are great for dessert!"}
{"text":"Needed a late dinner (after 8) fix and this place is right down the street.  Had a coupon from the entertainment book that was about to expire so we thought we would give it a try.  I used to eat at Pizza Heaven when it was further south along 7th St and always had a good meal. I called in and order for the works pizza and picked it up a short 20 minutes later, starving.  The pizza was ready when I got there and the counter girl was friendly.  These guys know how to make a pie!  Very tasty and an abundance of toppings.  Getting ready to have some for lunch!   I think my girlfriend and I will be eating there with more frequency in the future and trying some of the other menu items.  I can walk there from my house, they have live music every Friday and they serve beer and wine!  And for those who might be interested, the offer vegan cheese and gluten free crust.  Not for me though.  I want the real stuff and Pizza Heaven can definitely provide that."}
{"text":"Terrible! Wings tasted like they were all made at the beginning of the day, then reheated when sold. Pizza was below average.   Wasted $22"}
{"text":"I hope the pizza is better then the wait! We were told it would take about 15minutes for our order to be complete. It took them 50 minutes to complete our order. We then approached them about taking so long, they did not want to accommodate and finally said they would give us 50% off the next time we come. Well we are not sure if we will be returning. The wait was too long! Praying the food is good ..fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Got an extra large cheese pizza and it was huge. Also tried the wings and the penne chicken alfredo with spinach. Everything was just about average. Nothing special but still good, decent food.  Pizza had a good amount of cheese and not too much sauce.  Wings were just standard. Nothing too special about them  Chicken alfredo was good but only had enough room for a couple bites.  Anyways, in review. Good, but not great."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely amazing. (good) italian vegan food is hard to find and this is the place to go. i had the veggie balls and the vegan baked ziti and added mushrooms. every bite was amazing. good for sharing bc the portions are HUGE. I've never been able to finish anything from here in one sitting."}
{"text":"Love their vegan options here (appetizers, entrees, pizza and desserts ). My entire family was happy here (thats a challenging thing sometimes ). I ordered the vegan sausage parm sandwich with salad and vegan ranch ...it was truly amazing. I miss the italian neighborhoods growing up in NY with the delicious food and this brought me back home, only even better because it was vegan !!!!!!!  My hubby got the cajun alfredo pasta and son got the chipotle pasta dish (both non vegan or vegetarian ) but both said it was delicious...couldn't confirm but both too are picky about portions and taste and they both were very satisfied!  We cant wait to try the other things on the menu...we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix so far. I come for the Vegan Delight. If you are vegan you will be delighted. I honestly don't want pizza from anywhere else unless it's from here or homemade by someone I know. These are very strong statements. I just finished eating a slice, lol."}
{"text":"A fun lunch joint close to the Central corridor, but with restrictive parking, so their delivery service is handy for those in-office events.  The menu is easy to navigate, and if you're a \"slice and a soda\" kind of guy, this is your place. Well, two slices, anyway. The counter help was efficient and suggested several combinations he preferred, which we fond helpful.  We were sorted through the ordering/payment process in under 30 seconds, start to finish.   I had a great Chicken Florentine sandwich, and my companion ordered the Meatball Parmigiana. Both were a little slow in their preparation, but were put up to the window piping hot and with a fresh bag of Lay's potato chips.  The chicken was properly cooked, and the sub roll it was served on was slightly crunchy, but mostly chewy, and tasted fresh-baked. The mozzarella was a tad lacking, and the mushrooms tasted blanched, but the fresh spinach made up for all that.  The meatball parm was a delight, as the meatballs lacked that disgusting MSG-esque aftertaste and filler so common with cheap, frozen commissary-style meatballs. The sauce, well, that was just delightful - a little acidic and sweet, but tasting fully of ripened tomatoes all the way. This sandwich was adorned with kalamata olives and roasted peppers. Yum.  The ambiance is \"deli-meets-Olive Garden\" (in a way), and count on waiting in line for the bathroom facilities when it's lunch rush. There is room to have a bunch of people in the back room, but it will get incredibly noisy. Screaming children have no place here.  Bottom line:  Reasonably priced, decent ambiance, awful parking, delightful staff."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The Veggie Balls are a must try appetizer. I think we've gone here 3 times in the last two weeks. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but not great service. We went on a Friday night, the music was perfect and the lighting was romantic. We ordered a little bit of everything, the caprese salad was good, I liked that you could poor your own amount of balsamic on it...the wings were just ok, pretty messy and our server did not leave us with any extra napkins and I had to eat HOT wings without a drink...I had an empty beer glass and was never offered water. I noticed waters on all of the other tables though. The owner looked at our table several times so I thought she noticed but nothing was done. The pizza was good, but need a little more sauce(i'm a sauce fan). We also tried the sausage lasagna and thought it was delicious.  We will probably go back again for a nice relaxing dinner but only order a pizza or pasta dish. I would recommend making reservations on a Friday night as after we were seated, the place got very busy.   Overall it's a nice place and worth a try if you've never been or if you are on a vegan/vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"allthough the pizza is pretty good  the delivery service is a rip off if you have half and half  its an extra $1.50 even if one half is just pepperoni # $3.00 delivery and then tax on top it makes the pizza pretty dam expensive   so i will not use them anymore"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my husband and I drive all the way from far East Mesa to eat here as often as we can, which isn't as much as we want to since I don't live in Central Phx anymore :( We've gotten to know the owner Patricia and her son Erick since we go there on either Friday or Saturday night to hear the live music and eat the yummy food. The Baked Ziti is my favorite and my husband loves the Calzone. We both love the pizza and the baked wings as well.  I'm drooling as I type this.   Our love of this place does not stop at the food though. We actually had Erick Hasbun, the owners son play at our wedding and had the food catered from there as well. They brought it all the way to Gilbert and it was amazing! Erick is an awesome singer and guitar player and we couldn't be happier with how the food turned out. Everyone loved it! The Spinach Chicken Alfredo (I think thats what it was) was something we had at the wedding that I had never tried and it was amazing too! That pan was eaten up first! That was a hit!  I will end this by saying Thank You Pizza Heaven for always being worth the drive! Can't wait until we can make it down there again very soon!  Thanks! Kathy and Bob Vidican"}
{"text":"I found this place by using Yelp and being a Vegan that hates Daiya cheese this was the place to be. They use follow you heart even though it is more expensive for them to get it.   Me and my non Vegan boyfriend absolutely loved this dining experience. He could not tell that the cheese was a soy cheese, the pizza crust was awesome and the live acoustic music was wonderful.  The manager/ owner came by our table and many other tables to check and see how we liked the food and asked even if we had suggestions but we didn't ... everything was perfect. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Food was over 2 hours late, was told food would take 45-60mins but was a 3 hour wait. No manager to avaliable to speak with. Employees forgot to place order and all the could do was say sorry. Talk to several employees and no one seem to know what was going on. Worst experience ordering pizza."}
{"text":"Don't let the small building and parking turn you away! After parking on the street right beside Pizza Heaven, my bf and I enjoyed what I will just call my best vegan find yet.  Being a Friday evening, it was busy and loud, but that didn't bother us at all. What felt like a little hectic of a start (lots of people in a small space) turned into a very enjoyable evening. From the live music, to the huge vegan section of the menu, delicious food (we had the vegetarian pizza, and salad with vegan ranch) and a personal table visit from the owner-- pizza heaven won me over!   Vegan Foodies- it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The Miko Miko Hawaiian pizza and mozzarella sticks were good, the servers both River and Alex was very attentive. We will return!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My girlfriend and I went here for date night and it was incredible. We got the caprese salad, hot agave BBQ wings, I got the calzone (with sausage and bacon) and my girlfriend got the chipotle chicken pasta. It was literally the best Italian food I've ever had. I feel so strongly that I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review right now. We met the owner, Patricia, who was a delight and our server Lorenzo was very cool as well and had some great suggestions. We will definitely be returning. Do not pass this place up. The atmosphere, food, and service are all top notch. Side note, there's an Oregano's down the street but this place is far superior. Far. Superior. Do not sleep on this place. Spend your money here on better Italian food in greater quantities. Thank you Pizza Heaven Bistro!"}
{"text":"This is currently my go to pizza joint for Friday/Saturday night take out when I'm looking for that typical traditional crust style pizza (or in other words, when I'm in the mood to load up on a crapload of carbs).    As others have pointed out they also have vegan options and Italian style entrees.  Anyway, talking standard pizza here, the ingredients are quality, service is good (20 minute turn around whenever I take out), price is reasonable, and it tastes delicious.  There's really not much else for me to say.   Simply solid (aka really good!) pizza (and breadsticks).  Definitely much better than your standard big chain pizza places."}
{"text":"Now that I have been going out a little more since moving to Phx, I have found other restaurants that I feel very at home in. This has been on of my favorites.......till now.............  I usually come during the day time to avoid the   candle light atmosphere. I bring my lap top (WIFI free) but I came in  tonight and found the music so annoying. If only they would get real musicians that sound good while dining instead of the young kid who is ALWAYS there, Don't they ever change their songs.  Pizza still good but anything else is boring like the music. Boring shouldn't be LOUD. I found Cibos and will stick with them for now"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! I've order delivery at home a few times now and it's usually perfect.  One time there was an error they were so professional and fixed their mistake. I recently placed a large order for work and everything was perfect and delivery was fast!! We love their think crust with jalapeño, jalapeño poppers, Greek salad and caprese salad.  And my favorite thing about this place is how they treat vegetarians and others with dietary restrictions.  They are never annoyed when I ask them questions about menu items and request a clean cutter for my pizza.  This is our go to place for delicious pizza and the closest to New York style I have had since I moved here a year ago. I am born and raised New Yorker so I have high standards for pizza :)"}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious Hot Pizza To Go. I love this place.   I always get To Go Pizza here. The restaurant looks small and uninviting.  the pizza is crazy good. The staff is always super friendly. Coupons show up on Groupon and others.   I haven't yet found a better pizza in Phoenix.. well I haven't been to Pizza Bianco yet.   Let me know if you found a better place than Pizza Heaven."}
{"text":"Patricia, the owner, contacted me the same the same day about my ordering difficulties.  It appears to have been an issue with a phone outage and Patricia wasn't contact by Yelp about it.  So I guess I need to give Yelp a 1 star review!!  Patricia has made me an offer for a free entree for my troubles and due to this I will change my review to 3 stars.  Once I order from the Bistro I will change the review again based on what looks like really good food.  Thank you, Patricia, for your prompt and friendly response!!!  Received my order today and it was DELICIOUS.  I love the chicken on the salad, very flavorful and moist!!!  Thanks again to Patricia and I will definitely be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. They have vegan menu. Ate the vegan pizza which was  amazingly tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan meatballs and the vegan calzone. The meatballs were fantastic, especially in that super spicy buffalo sauce! However, I was disappointed with the calzone. The cheese was tasteless and the vegetables that I added in had hardly any flavor. It's difficult to find vegan pizza, so I was a bit discouraged to find that the food wasn't up to par with other places I've eaten at. I'd definitely be willing to give it another try, though!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some of the best pizza in Phoenix you found it. The pizza was full of flavor and not greasy (which is a pizza deal breaker for me). We ordered a medium for 2 people and was more than enough with a few slices for left overs. It was quick and easy on the wallet. Kept up the good work."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The service is friendly amd attentive, the crust on the pizza is perfectly crispy, and the patio is a great spot for my 3 yr old to be entertained by being outside with his favorite food, pizza! We have fun and eat awesome food every time we're  here :)"}
{"text":"My brother lives in Phoenix and being a bargain hunter got a Groupon.  Very pleasant experience, really cute establishment with a great vibe.  Food was delicious and LOTS of it, I had ziti and thought it was great, we got wings, I did not have any but the guests said they were great.  Pizza was very good  If I am in the area again will certainly go again"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The best pizza in Phoenix! And the meatballs are delicious made just right.  The service is great very personable. I had the chance to meet the owner. She is super sweet and all of her dishes come from her own family recipes... Amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a Fancy Nancy party for our two year old here. As usual, the food was fantastic. What was even better was their overall attitude and excitement in being part of a bunch of crazies all dressed up in what a 2 year old thinks is fancy attire. They were helpful in every way possible. This is our favorite pizza place for many reasons and we'll keep going back."}
{"text":"OK, I think I'm more than a fan of this place!  A girl I had dated introduced me to, and I have been hooked ever since. Its something in the sauce, try it! So good- and also, some nights they have a band and all the time its free Wi-Fi"}
{"text":"Used EAT24 take out. Great pizza. Wings are good.  We'll worth it. I will be using them over the hut in the future"}
{"text":"the spaghetti dinner is huge-en0ugh for 2 people. very tastey and flling. the calzones are also great-also enough for 2 peny and miss the ricotta/mozzarella calzonesople. i grew up in ny and miss the rocotta csalzones that are sols on the street corners. the service is also great at pizza heaven and i really like the hometown atmosphere"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! It has a hearty vegan menu (and of course non-vegan stuff). Such a treat. The vegan sausage sandwich was delish and the vegan cheesecake was just as good if not better than regular cheesecake. We went on a Friday and the owner's 20 something children were playing a live acoustic set. Such a great vibe this place has. So happy to have found it. Yay!"}
{"text":"loved their pizza and wings, the spot has a chilled atmosphere with a good vibe.. I will deifinately be a return customer. I paid $31 for a 16\" pizza and 5 wings, in my opinion it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and two kids went to PHB on 5/8/15.  We were in town picking up our son from ASU.  Our first choice was a one hour wait. So we went there and arrived at 9:25 pm, it closed at 10:30.  Our hostess set us down in the main dining room.  There were 6 other tables being used, and two or three had dirty dishes from previous patrons.   We were asked if we wanted something to drink, my kids had sodas, my wife and I had a beer and asked for a glass of water.  The sodas and beers arrived and we asked for the water again.   10 minutes later our waiter arrived and took our order.  We asked for the water again, and he said it would be there shortly. They brought an appetizer to our table, but no water, so we asked again..this time he brought it for us. We waited and waited for our food, and it did not arrive, but the waiter came to see what kind of dressing our son wanted on his salad.  We informed him that he had not ordered a salad. He had our table confused with someone else.  During this time, there was another couple sitting next to us, that was trying to get someones attention to pay their bill.  Finally someone came by. Our food arrived at about 10:25.  My lasagna was in a dish, tasted like Mona Lisa's (costco brand) lasagna, that they cut a slice and put into a dish and put it in the broiler.  Everything was totally melted down, the pasta was so over cooked...it was not very good.  The pizza was just basic pizza. About 10:45 our bill arrived.  BEFORE THAT NO ONE CAME BY TO SEE HOW OUR FOOD WAS OR IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE.. We put our credit card on top of the folder visible to anyone walking by.  OH YEAH, when our food arrived we were the only ones left in the restaurant, and they started cleaning the place up.  knocking dishes and glasses all around us, then they started to mop the place with some foul smelling cleanser, which is probably OK as long as no one is there eating or digesting their food. We waited about five minutes for someone to pick up our bill, finally we just got up and paid it and left.  Terrible service...Food, just ok..nothing special...We should have stayed at Oregano's down the street."}
{"text":"Highly dissatisfied with the food here. Read what seemed be many good reviews and was craving pizza (I eat gluten free, not by choice it makes me ill). There was nothing special about the gf pizza, the mozzarella cheese was barely past melted. I also ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta which was #1 way hotter than it needed to be (only took a few bites) and was brought to my table with 2 pieces of garlic bread (shoved into the pasta an sauce) which makes me wonder if the kitchen staff know anything about gluten sensitivity, even though the website seems to boast about their gluten free and vegan options. The waiter was polite and did remove the pasta from my bill which I greatly appreciate! My brother and his wife had the Chicken Parmesean which was NOT homemade. The chicken was more of a chicken patty or chicken nugget type of texture! The frys and the wings were also noticeably from a bag. Anyway, if I could give negative stars I would, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Undercooked noodles in the spaghetti. The meatballs in the spaghetti were bland and overcooked. The wings were so small they had practically no meat on them.  The side salad came with shriveled greens and cucumbers that look rotten."}
{"text":"Great place, not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, lousy service!  I have been buying take out pizza from Pizza Heaven for some time now (even back  when  they were on 7th and about Highland).  So I  decided to dine in once.  What a  mistake.  We sat for over 30 minutes and no  service.  The place wasn't that  busy but apparently business  is so good they don't have to wait on customers.  If you want take out, then I recommend  it, but for dining in, forget it.  Hence the two star rating."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza! It's expensive, but as someone who is desperate for options, it's worth it. I ordered carryout and the girl who took my order told me the gluten free crust is only for 10\" pizzas and thin crust. I ordered one with pepperoni and one with Canadian bacon & pineapple. The total was $27. I swear, I felt my wallet twitch. The crust was crunchy, slightly dry (but that's the gluten free life). They add a lot of cheese, which I love, and there were plenty of toppings. Overall, satisfying and delicious. Just wish it was a liiiiittle cheaper."}
{"text":"Waitress was available, but had very little attention to detail. Dropped off our salads but no silverware on the tables. Calzones are huge, good value for the price, gluten free beer options are great.   Owner asked us how our meal was going but didn't have the heart to tell her the server could use some work.   Just a pet peeve, but I find it strange when bistros and theme restaurants do not play \"Italian\" music, but rather 90s alternative rock..."}
{"text":"We've been loving this place for years.  Best pizza. Best Italian dishes.  Even the vegans will love this place as there is a dedicated section on the menu.  All things considered, Pizza Heaven Bistro is our favorite place to dine in all of Arizona."}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza place!!! The owner and staff are so wonderful and they make everything from scratch! The meat balls are to die for and the brick oven pizza is life changing!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing I had the Calzone and wow was I amazed !it's Ginormous lol , I def recommend this place ! I came to check it out by word to mouth and I am impressed , pizzas are made from scratch , they even have wheat dough and a large selection of a vegan menu but most importantly the food is delicious. This place is a must. Oh and did I mention that the owners Mr. & Mrs. Hasbun are so kind and very friendly ?! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks great service Waitresses are so sweet love the two girls working tonight  will definitely be back best pizza in town!! The calzones are to die for huge and yummy!"}
{"text":"Order a gluten free veggie pizza to go. It was 20 minutes before we got home and ate. The crust was still crisp and all the ingredients were together on top. Not the usual soggy, slide off veggie pie. It was great."}
{"text":"I only do take out so all that matters to me is a kind person at the register and a high quality pizza at a fair price. Pizza Heaven exceeds in every area. I am not sure how they get such a wonderful staff, but it never fails that they go the extra mile in the smallest ways. If pizza is not ready when I arrive, they offer a free drink. If I order a group of items that are on special they charge me less without me asking. They are just genuinely good people and it is for real. It is the kind of deep rooted pursuit of perfection that I have rarely encountered but always admire. Well done and appropriately named."}
{"text":"I have had 3 problems in the past.  All of them were when the manager was not in. Calls were answered by a young female voice.  1st problem. ordered lazagna. There were pieces of plastic in my food.  I almost choked on on them. ended throwing most of it out. I called to complain and was given, *Sorry*. I figured that staff probably can not make a *corporate decision*.  Also figured the lazagna was frozen  prior, the reasoning being, the plastic container, when food was frozen, broke off into the food.  2nd problem. Ordered a WORKS PIZZA. It was delivered with less items than usual. Called and another pizza was delivered but the rest of our meal had to be re-heated.               3rd problem.      ordered a Greek salad. it was delivered w/the box half empty. called and another salad was delivered.  My family started    their dinner before I received my salad.    seems care is not taken with delivery orders."}
{"text":"Tried PHB for the first time and all of our food was great. Exactly what we were looking for. Love that we could order and pay online, very convenient. We had pizza, wings (yum), and dessert. They gave us free breadsticks too. All so very filling and excellent tasting. This is our new go to pizza place! We'll have to eventually try some other items on the menu as well. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, the Carnivori is a delicious meaty pizza and is my new favorite.  This is a very nice little place that I'll drive across town to enjoy again.  Had never been here before and only found it because we searched for pizza near the Rhythm Room.  I live in Gilbert but I'm def coming back.  The owner came and talked with us for a bit and she's passionate about all her home made food.  Thanks Patricia!"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven is the perfect lunch spot. It is such a good deal and very tasty pizza. For around $5 you get a slice of pizza, salad, and drink - and for a small up charge you can get any toppings you want on your single slice. Most places in the area charge way more for pizza of this quality and you can't order just a single slice the way you like it. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We were only in town for two days and we opted to go here twice because it's that good! Their vegan cheese is incredible and the crust is perfectly crispy and airy. We got the Vegan Delight which comes with savory soy crumbles, the vegan mozzarella, and subbed bell peppers for pineapple. Also tried the vegan BBQ pizza which was a home run. (Don't forget to grab some VEGAN ranch). A must-stop for any vegan! Thanks, Pizza Heaven, for the best vegan pizza we've ever had."}
{"text":"Its a tiny lil place, aint it? But their pizza hit the spot! Chicken wings...meh."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for three years and I have yet to find a better pizza joint in town.  My family and I come every Friday night to hear the live music-eric and jimmy are awesome!  For all you haters, maybe you'd better stick with Little Ceasar's because you clearly don't appreciate good pizza!  I've had almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate here a couple of times. We liked their pizza, wings, and tiramisu. However, the customer service is terrible. Thought I would give them another try, thinking that maybe they just had an off day, not the case! Unfortunately, the quality of the food doesn't make up for the lack of good customer service so we won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Decided to dine in during lunch hours. this place was picked mainly for the fact that they are vegan friendly.  The wings were cooked perfectly and sauce was mild sauce was ok. The Vegan delight pizza was really delicious. The cheese wasn't slimy and greasy like some vegan cheeses. They use Follow your heart cheese and it was very flavorful. topping were spot on. Soy sausage was surprisingly delicious, the taste was very similar to meat sausage. I even enjoyed it and im not vegan my girlfriend is. Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. he was even kind enough to ask the cook what kind of cheese was on the pizza. All in all i give this place two thumbs up and will be dining here again soon!"}
{"text":"For a local joint, it isn't too shabby.  I've ordered delivery twice so far, and both times they've been earlier than they estimate (first time they were a minute early lol, the second like 20 minutes).  They even call to let you know they're on their way, and the drivers are super friendly.  The pizzas are tasty, especially for their price point.  The first time I ordered a cheese/half pepperoni pizza, and it was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Oddly enough there was one super tiny slice that had no cheese on it lol.  I couldn't explain it.  Second time it was the margarita, which was good.  The wings are big and meaty, and have always had tons of sauce.  Great experience."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from some friends when we showed up to their place, and there it was- Heaven in a box.   We had it delivered again last night, and it was still damn good.   The chicken alfredo pizza is amazing. It has just the right amount of everything- moist chicken, alfredo sauce, spinach, parmesan- and nothing is overwhelming or too rich.   The Queen Margherita was a hit too- basil, tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella- wow. I could have eaten the entire pie myself.   The prices are on par with what you'd expect to pay at Z Pizza, and it's worth it. The crust isn't greasy at all- it's perfect.   They have other things- sandwiches and salads, etc. but I haven't ventured beyond the pizza section of the menu yet.   They do deliver, but sadly for me I live two blocks south of the cut off point. Boo hoo."}
{"text":"Bland crust. Bland cheese. Bland thin watery sauce. Even the sausage topping was meh. Do not recommend. How so many yelpers can give such glowing reviews... there are much better options ."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh  I visited this establishment for a take out pizza experience. I did call a head. I walked in to an environment that was not well lit. I waited at the counter... No one was around. I waited some more... No one was around. Finally a kid comes out and asks what I need. I tell him, he gives me my order and then I pay and then I leave. The staff seems unfriendly and the establishment felt uninviting.   This is not pizza or any edible form of what any Italian would call pizza. No passion, no care, no zest for or importance placed on quality of ingredients.  Really? I cannot be the lone wolf that tastes how bad this is? Lack of quality.   I am sorry to be so harsh but it just gets annoying to see all of these business get away with mediocrity. Sometimes I feel like we need a champ. Someone to step up and fight for the little guy. Well here it is.... \"Rocky music playing in the background\"   Don't go. If you like pizza and respect yourself then do not go. Raise your hands high turn around and walk away.   Sorry, not sorry.   The Sarcastic Truth Villain.   P.S. Check the restaurant inspection report."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My girlfriend and I will often stop in for lunch and get their 5 wings  w/ 1 slice lunch special. Their food is awesome and the staff are very polite. Great drink prices. The owner is a gem. She will often walks around a check on tables/serve/bus, etc. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The best vegan options ever. I love the veggieballs. Definitely coming here always"}
{"text":"I just need to update this with some new things I've found to like about Pizza Heaven.  First of all: the vegan cheese they have here is delicious.  I didn't know they had it and was stuck getting lousy Z Pizza when I was eating with my vegan or lactose-intolerant friends.  Not only does it get the job done, it gets the job done well enough that no one, not even me, misses the real cheese.  Second:  Not only is Pizza Heaven is open on Sundays, it's open until 10 PM on Sundays.  All those pizza restaurants that think that no one really NEEDS pizza on a Sunday can suck it.  Sometimes no other food will do.  And luckily for Phoenicians, they have an excellent family-owned option when that Sunday craving hits."}
{"text":"We usually get pizza delivery, but tonight decided to dine-in at Pizza Heaven Bistro.  We were pleasantly surprised to have live music during our visit as well as an extremely attentive waiter.  Service was very quick and the owner even stopped by our table twice to see how we were doing.  The pizza was excellent as always, and my husband liked the wings so much that he ate the whole plateful by himself.  We finished off with the brownie ala mode, which was devoured in a short time.  Overall, the quick service, excellent staff, great food and affordable prices will bring us back again!"}
{"text":"You know that smell a plate gets that hasn't been washed properly after you eat eggs or chicken? That's what Pizza Heaven's wings taste like. Not to mention they were chewy almost as if the wings had been reheated in a microwave and then \"fresh\" sauce was poured on top. I asked to please have my wings remade and it was the same thing over again. The waitress mentioned that their wings are baked and that might be reason for the consistency of the meat and the smell. Oh, ok, stupid me. That explains it. I give the place 2 stars for an ok cheese pizza."}
{"text":"This is a great local pizza spot. Perfect place for lunch meetings and affordable quality food! Thanks Patricia for being awesome and having a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!  If you want a GREAT PIZZA in a WARM, QUAINT environment then this is the place for you.  One of the first things I noticed at Pizza Heaven was that it is family run.  It was such a pleasure to see the whole family chipping in to make such a great place, down to the son of the owner playing music for all to enjoy!  I came to Pizza Heaven specifically to try their VEGAN pizza.  I have had Vegan Cheese before and I was a little apprehensive to try it, but to my amazement it was AMAZING!  This was the first time since I have been vegan that I have had a pizza that actually tasted like a traditional pizza.  I was blown away!  The next day while I was in town I did go to Z Pizza and tried their Vegan Cheese.  Though I did also enjoy Z Pizza's establishment, hands down PIZZA HEAVEN blew their pizza away!  Sincerely,  Rick D."}
{"text":"I am speechless!!!!!!  There are a few things my hubby and I are picky about: Eating out, Pizza and good service!  It is a cute, quaint little place full of warmth and  happiness! Too cheesy? Just like their amazing pizza! We were greeted with friendly faces and you can tell that they loved their jobs! We were immediately seated at a table, I asked our server if we could move to a booth as a family just left and the live music was a tad bit too loud. She quickly cleaned up the booth and let us move! The music was still a bit loud, but it was much more cozier in the corner booth.   We ordered a pepperoni pizza, mozzarella sticks and baked medium chicken wings. A-H-MAZING. Their marinara is homemade and delicious. Their wing sauce had just the perfect kick and the pizza was absolutely delicious, so ooey and gooey!  Our server was awesome. Sadly I do not remember her name. But she was on top of her game. Very welcoming and personable. She checked in on us a lot but not too much. And she didn't ask how the food was as we took a bite ;)   By far the best part about this experience was finding out it is family owned and operated. The owner actually checked in on us as well.   It was a great experience for a great prize. We spent under $40 and found the perfect date night spot!  I am from Chicago, so I know what good pizza is, and this was fabulous."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and very good pizza! Pizza Heaven takes customer service very seriously. Service staffer is always extremely friendly and regularly making certain patrons are satisfied. Our experience here is always a good one. Nice touch having musicians play for patrons."}
{"text":"Custom calzone was amazing... Great mozz sticks and chicken wings very good.  Got delivery to a local hotel. Fast fresh and awesome!!   Get a calzone w ricotta mozz parm salami and sausage. Unfknbelievable!!"}
{"text":"Follow Your Heart is back - yay!! And always great communication from the owner - thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow...for Liza K to give the food an outstanding review only to drop it 2 two stars because the live music interfered with her internet browsing is...bizarre. (They only play on Fri and Sat nights...) Hey, the music isn't Top 40 radio play. But when I go there for the food, its nice to have \"life's backdrop\", (which I thoroughly enjoy, BTW) going on. And if I stop by for WiFi, which I have on occasion, I mean, really, PUT HEADPHONES ON IF IT BOTHERS YOU. lol Whats even better, if you think you can do better, liza, they always invite folks to jam with them. Overall, its a fun, family environment not intended to be a 'library', as the Ricky C put it. As a loyal customer for many years, I will miss this place when I move (Including Eric & Jimmy Lee play those oldie hits). I stand by my last review...best pizza anywhere around. Great atmosphere (yep, even the music)"}
{"text":"My fiance and I ended up here after having no luck with finding an open pizza place for an early dinner.  Although this is a little place, quite cramped, with loads of tables and chairs, the staff was extremely friendly and the server was sharp as a tack, and super attentive.  We had a simple pepperoni pizza and a Greek salad and we were both quite impressed. The pizza came out of the kitchen hot. The crust was thin, chewy and crispy on the edges.  I really like this place because it's a no-frills pizza place that uses fresh ingredients. I also like it because it's family-owned and operated...so tired of huge chain places, you know? I grabbed a magnet (which boasts delivery service, heck yes!) and a to-go menu on my way out the door. We'll surely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food , service and cheerful staff .I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great meal . The outdoor setting is very peaceful considering its right by all of the traffic. Totally worth it !"}
{"text":"It's almost 10pm on a Friday night & we just ordered delivery~ we were told it would be approx one hour & that's just fine bc it's worth the wait.   You can take my word for it bc this is prob the 50th-75th? (totally guessing) time we've ordered take-out from Pizza Heaven.  One off our neighbors turned us on to PHBistro about 10.5 years ago when we moved into the 'hood.   The employees who take your order over the phone are SO friendly and NICE ~ as are the people who deliver.   And... oh by the way... the food is really good.  We usually get a pizza (or two-if we have friends over) ~sometimes I'll get pasta.  :)    We've never had a bad experience here.   ***at a time when you should NOT believe every review you read on Yelp~ you CAN absolutely believe this one is real.  NO ONE paid me, I was NOT compensated in any way, nor has anyone ever asked me to write a review for PH.  After 10+ years I think it's about time I wrote one! ***"}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant! The food is always very good. I have been there many times and tried many different things.  At night it can be semi romantic.They dim the lights and they have live music. The wings are very good, as well as the meals and pizza. The coffee is never hot for some reason.  That would be about the only thing i could find wrong. They used to be a small little dive restaurant and have now moved several years ago to the location they are now. Food has always been good though. Sometimes dives are the best! It is family owned and run so  i think that is why they take such pride in the place. A very good thing. They have their own parking lot but, not many spaces on a busy  night. Great place for a meal at any time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is excellent, the food is excellent and the prices are fair for the amount of food. Best part is their vegan menu which has great pasta dishes, subs and pizzas. The owner makes some of the appetizers from scratch as well as the vegan cheese cake. Amazing. She did her research and got follow your heart brand cheese which if you're a vegan you know daiya cheese just doesn't cut it. They put their effort into accommodating for many food preferences."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Pizza Heaven is your classic comfortable, casual, neighborhood pizza joint.  The prices are great, the food is delicious, and the service is always fast and friendly.  We love to go on the weekends when there is live music.  Erick and Jimmy do a great job and have a long list of songs that you can request - like a live juke box!    I have liked everything I have had here, but our family favorites are the meatball calzone, veggie pizza, and the primavera alfredo pasta.  The breadsticks are great too!  When I was pregnant my husband was making runs here at least three times a week.  My baby is made out of their spaghetti and meatballs :)"}
{"text":"Best pasta I've ever had!! Service can't be better, super cozy, I'm always so comfortable there I end up staying two hours! Everything is so delicious, but I love their spicy pastas, tequila lime and chipotle are my favorite. Awesome!!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great pizza at a great price! This place is clean and for the price can't be beat! Is this place Pizza Blanco? No, but for the location, price and value...well...Delicious!"}
{"text":"Random restaurant choice during a workday lunch, which turned out to be a good find! Had the lunch specials--a couple of cheese slices and a drink ($4.50, but extra for toppings) and the 1 slice (one topping), salad, and drink ($5.50). Salad was small and fresh--lettuce, tomato, carrots, and even some bacon bits! My slice was with sausage and cooked perfectly--very tasty! My partner in crime had olives and mushrooms, which looked good and there definitely weren't any complaints.  Service was great, although it seemed as though one person (Drew) was the only one there, along with the chef. The atmosphere was smallish but cozy, nice ambiance overall.  Prices are really reasonable and this place is apparently a great option for vegetarians/vegans. Will definitely go back to give the sandwiches a try when we're back in the area! Would definitely be interested in checking out the live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"TOTALLY LOVE THIS PLACE. Always worth the drive and definitely worth the extra couple bucks. If you're a ricotta fan, the Pizza Bianca rocks my world!!"}
{"text":"I've tried Pizza Heaven three times (Takeout with family, lunch eat-in with co-workers & lunch eat-in with in  laws) and each time I've not been disappointed.  Quick Summary: Large portion sizes, affordable, flavorful, courteous service.  The services: Each time we have received courteous service at the counter. There is really no waiter during lunch hours, and I'm not familiar with their dinner service, so I can't speak to this. You walk in, order at the counter, get your drinks, and find a table to sit. Once the food is ready, it is brought to your table along with plates & forks.   The wait time: Medium to Long. Depending on what you order, it can be on the long side. The longest we waited was 30 minutes to get 2 veggie and 2 meatball hot stuffed sandwiches, and 1 pizza (which we requested upon ordering to have it packed as 'to go'). If you are in a hurry or have a larger group, I suggest calling ahead and placing your order for eat-in.  The food: Dedicated Vegan Menu? Yes, please. Large portion Sizes? Absolutely. Tasty, flavorful comfort food? Right on target. This place was a hit with both my carnivore family members and co-workers, and my vegan preferences! Portion sizes are in fact very large, the hot stuffed sandwiches can easily feed 2 people, and if you order the calzone make sure you are going to share!   Vegan Menu: High ratings to the vegan veggieballs - they are flavorful and full of veggies! I was expecting them to have a consistency of seitan or soy, but that is not the case (as alluded to by the name...). Must try in their hot stuffed sandwich.   Carnivore Menu: \"The Works\" pizza has an admirable # of toppings - these slices are packed with cheese, meat, and vegetables--definitely a winner. Also make sure to check out their Meatball Parmigiana hot stuffed sandwich - hefty portion of meat, sauce, and cheese - it's impressive."}
{"text":"oh yeah they updated the soy cheese used to a vegan version and it is super tasty! Get some tonight, Vegans Unite!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings as an appetizer and the pizza as our main dish they were definitely worth the wait, both arrived to table at the same time. The meat lover pizza it was straight up on point! The wings were the perfect, had the medium buffalo sauce had a kick but it was super good (get them crispy)! The ranch was the perfect consistency extra tasty. Looks like they were short staffed, because waiters took a while to get back with our check. But we will definitely be back when they aren't so busy!"}
{"text":"Have ate at the restaurant a few times, which the food was good but service was slow and not very friendly. I did enjoy the fact that they had vegan options (since I don't eat meat) so I usually order take out from here, especially their vegan meatballs. However, the last time I was there I found multiple hairs inside my vegan meatballs. I called the restaurant to inform them of what happened and the gentleman I spoke with told me the manager would contact me later, since they were unavailable. Well needless to say it's been about a month and never heard back from them regarding the incident. They lost a customer as a result of the lack of good customer service."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. We loved it so much two weeks ago we are going back today from Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed to say the least! I ordered on GrubHub for delivery.   I ordered fried zucchini sticks which were pretty good! Except finding an order of mozzarella sticks tossed in with them which was not a good thing considering they were less than satisfactory.  The pizza slice I ordered, is probably one of the worst slices I've had in a while! I'm glad I just didn't order a full pizza.   So the slice of pizza was part of a meal special: slice, wings, and soda.  No soda came and the wings were rock hard.   Such a waste of money. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I appreciate the vegan menu, my reason for coming here! I got 3 entrees and angel bites for dessert which is an absolute must. Ziti with mock meat was incredible, served with garlic bread.  We drove 40 minutes here we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time, seeing as though they have options for vegetarians like me. We get there and there are only about six people in the restaurant. Our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered the veggieball parmigiana , now here's the tricky part apparently. All I asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese. I wanted the  whole sandwich to be meat free and just have non vegan cheese. Simple enough right? Wrong, I thought the server's head was about to pop off. He simply could not grasp this simple order, the sandwich comes with a side so I ordered the salad. So time goes on and he brings out my order, ya not so much. He brings out veggieballs I will give him that, but it's an appetizer not the sandwich I ordered. So he takes it back and brings out my salad. Then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries. I didn't ask for fries I asked for the salad side. So now I'll be charged for a salad and fries. I'm with my boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian, and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable. It wasn't a busy night and I was not being unreasonable. I will never be back here again."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is one of the best in town!! We have been eating there for over a year and haven't gone wrong yet with our favorites. The wings are cooked perfectly with the meat falling off the bone with great options for homemade sauce. the hand tossed pizza is mouthwatering and our creation is always cooked to perfection --Canadian Bacon, Ricotta Cheese, Mushrooms, and Meatballs!!! AWESOME! The service is always quick and friendly and the delivery is fast and the pizza is HOT!"}
{"text":"Omg. Stopped before comicon started and it was AMAZING. I had the baked ziti and my daughter had the calzone. They were both huge and magnificent.  We will definitely make the drive from Mesa after this."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little pizza wine bar ever.  It's so Tiny. They might get twenty five people in there.  Everything on the menu is just absolutely heaven.  The staff was very helpful with the menu.  And recommendations.    Very clean.  Highly recommended.  Will return."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have ever had! The vegan baked ziti with soy sausage is to die for! Prices are affordable and the wait staff is friendly and attentive! We are lifetime customers!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best delivery meals I've ever had!! Hands down the best!!! Chicken parmesan marinara  was delicious and the meatball sandwich!! Wow wheeee!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious hot and fresh as well as the Parmesan fries and jalapeño poppers we ordered however, the customer service was extremely lacking. We had to constantly track down our waitress for water and basically anything else we needed because we were not checked on once the entire time we were there. I am not sure if it is because we went later in the evening but, I do have to mention the waitress seemed overwhelmed."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!!!! The whole wheat pizza dough was the best I have ever tasted! You can tell the sauces were made with only the freshest ingredients, including the veggies - they were so fresh! The pizza was not dripping in oil which was a plus! My girls got the soy calzone and we got a veggie pizza. My girls licked their plates clean and so did we! Customer service was wonderful and we only wish they had more of these places in Cali!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We'd driven by the place all the time for the past couple of years and always laughed at the name, but never stopped in, especially since there are so many Pizza options in the area. I am sad we waiting so long to check this out! The service is amazing, they've got a great happy hour with very cheap drinks, the ambiance is cute low-key and not pretentious, and the food is delicious!! The pizza is really really good. They've also got an extensive vegan and vegetarian menu, so something for everyone! This place is special. Check it out ASAP"}
{"text":"Came in here and they have so many vegan options yay! I had trouble choosing. Wanted a calzone because I haven't had one in so long, but ultimately I don't like vegan cheeses (except nut cheeses like cashew and almond) so I got the ravioli. It came with tomato sauce, tofu filling and garlic bread. For some reason I had it in my head that they would have a cream sauce, there was no reason for this, so I was a little disappointed when I saw the tomato sauce. That was my own fault for not asking and just expecting it to be a certain way. I didn't think to ask but should have asked if they would consider doing a cashew cheese option in the future. The dish was really good, couldn't finish the whole thing so did have leftovers. Would come here again, they have vegan pizza, apps, and baked ziti too so plenty more to try!"}
{"text":"Service was so great and the food was even better! Our server, Alonso, I believe his name was so attentive. Such a great place with so many vegan options!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I'm vegan and finding a non-vegan place that accomodates vegans so well is difficult but this place makes it a breeze. Not only do they have vegan options, they have a full vegan menu that accompanies their standard menu. This place is an awesome go-to regardless of dietary preferences, but don't knock the veg options. I've had other guests stop and ask what I'm eating because it looks so good, only to find out I've got the vegan option! I definitely recommend the stuffed sandwiches. They're HUGE (I always have enough to save half for later) and only end up costing about $7-8. Plus, Pizza Heaven offers both cheesecake and angel bites (fried dough with chocolate sauce or agave), which are delicious and vegan."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places!! I've only ordered delivery but would dine in if I wasn't so lazy!!! ;) I love the wheat crust option!!! Zucchini sticks are delicious..,and I could go on...!!!!"}
{"text":"Good priced pizza special for the spouse and a delicious vegan baked ziti with sausage for myself. The pizza special came with two crisp pepperoni slices and a drink for about $7. My ziti will be at least two meals for me and came with two large hunks of herby bread for around $11. James was a great server, very polite and attentive. This was our first spot to eat in Phoenix and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Fry's Take-N-Bake pizzas are better than these bad boys and only a 1/4 of the cost.  Last night a good buddy of mine and I had just finished up a long year of teaching and we wanted to celebrate by staying in, stuffing our faces with pizza, having a few beers and watching a movie. The beer was good, the movie was terrible, but the pizza might have been even worse! After ordering a single medium Veggie pizza using the EAT 23 online ordering service the pizza arrived about an hour after placing the order (not bad). The pizza + 10% tip was very pricey, $20 for a single medium pizza.  Most of the veggies on the pizza tasted undercooked and were still dripping water as if they were not properly dried out during prep and through the oven bake. As if the pizza wasn't bad enough, to add insult to injury, my friend had made a Fry's pizza for himself that tasted much better than the pizza I had just dropped $20 on.  I will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven is absolutely delicious. My boyfriend insisted I write a review for it since I rave about it so much. I usually order a hand tossed vegetarian and I've never been let down. The flavor a of the sauce and cheese with the freshness of the crust make it beyond delicious and satisfying (very generous portions). I prefer Pizza Heaven to a lot of the popular pizza joints in metro Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great service! David was wonderful and efficient. So kudos to you. Thanks for making my mothers birthday fun. The brownie was good. :) great GLUTEN FREE options-especially dealing with pasta."}
{"text":"First, the ambiance is right out of Jersey. Way too dark, fake plants, an impractical bar talking valuable real estate, orange walls -- you get the drift. I prefer to think of it as neighborhood Italian kitsch, but on a crabby day I might be less kind. The food is good, a must in any vegan's rotation. Both the pizza and subs are amazing. They use a superior vegan cheese, and I am not a fan of other fake cheese, especially on Italian cheese-centric dishes, but this stuff is amazing. My complaint is that your only side dish option for the sub is french fries - carbs with carbs; a small salad would be appreciated. Also ask for the additional veggies on the subs, they come with them but don't ask don't get. Prices are reasonable, pay at the register after the meal. Service is attentive, youthful, and helpful. Seems to be caught in between wanting to be a nice sit down restaurant and a pizza by the slice joint, but love it, even in the dark."}
{"text":"Now, I can think of several places in town that serve amazing pizza - La Grande, and Pizzeria Bianco come immediately to mind.  But Pizza Heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap, tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone.    The pizza itself is thin crust with a nice crispy, yet doughy taste.  The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.    Something that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.  The menu includes more than 20 veggie toppings, lowfat cheese and soy cheese upon request - something you don't find much of at a pizza joint - much less the fancy pizza palaces of Phoenix!    The decor inside is very simple - chairs and tables - no booths.  They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...  BTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw. Camelback and Missouri)."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a vegan friend, but the vegan (soy) cheese they had to offer for all their dishes was very strange tasting. I ordered the calzone and bbq pizza both of which came with the cheese. I was able to finish the calzone but I had to scrap off the cheese from the pizza in order to finish it sadly."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER get food from here again. I was completely dissatisfied with the food. We ordered a custom vegan 14\" pizza. We topped it with vegan sausage. We ordered the veggie meatball sub and the vegan cheesecake.  Delivery.  The pizza was inedible. They used so much sausage you couldn't taste anything but the sausage. It was hardly warm.  The sub was alright. Not enough sauce on it, the meatballs were dry. The fries that came with it were soggy and cold.  The vegan cheesecake was disgusting. I mean, I don't expect vegan food to be that amazing, so the bar wasn't set very high.  SOOO all in all, everything was cold and tasted gross  So I decided to call the place. I talked to the manager on duty and explained to her the situation. She told me that she couldn't do anything at the moment because she didn't have that type of authority. She told me that she would contact her boss and explain to them the situation and she would give me a call back. She gives me a call back and says \"yeah there is nothing I can do but offer you a discount on your next order because the only thing we messed up on our end were the fries\". COME ON! You had your chance. You could have remade the pizza. You could have took it off. You could have offered a gift card. You could have not been condescending. You should take pride in your food and the quality standards.  It could have been fixed in a number of ways, but this place chose not to.  I will never be back.  Also, you should have an email on your website, so customers can contact the owner or management. As an owner you should give your managers authority to make things right, but you have chose not too. If we were dining at the restaurant, we would have sent those items back. Would they have made us pay for the inedible food if we were to dine there? Would they have said \"we'll get ya next time\", instead of remaking the food so that it was at quality standard? I have no clue, but I highly doubt that I wouldn't have to give them a one star rating on yelp."}
{"text":"Okay guys...This place is a winner for Vegans!! They have a vegan section on their menu to die for, and WOW, the food was great! We had the baked Ziti, Agave BBQ Pizza, and the Veggieballs for lunch yesterday. You won't go wrong with their great tasting food, as well as the GREAT service. Caroline was our hostess and she was FANTASTIC! She fully explained their menu and addressed all of our questions about the items we asked about. Thanks Caroline...you're top notch!  Lastly, the owner, Patricia came over for a nice surprise visit during our lunch to see how we were doing and if we were enjoying the food, very classy, and what a great lady! If you get a chance to say \"hi\", please do, she's super friendly with the best attitude ever. And let me give her a GREAT BIG KUDOS for having \"Follow Your Heart\" cheese (non-dairy). Most places use/serve Daiya mozzarella non-dairy cheese (grossness!) and Pizza Heaven does not...THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!  We WILL be back and be bringing many friends with us...keep the oven hot ladies I'm gettin' my shoes on... ;-)"}
{"text":"This place has really delicious pizza. I had a sausage pizza from here last Sunday along with their angel bread sticks with marinara and I could've engulfed the whole thing. Their Hawaiian pizzas are also great, as are their calzones and lasagna. The owner is nice and friendly and this place is always busy, so overall, don't miss out. A great gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My fiancé and are trying to dip our toes in the vegan waters and I found this place while searching for vegan places on groupon. We have an infinite love for pizza as well, so I purchased their $20 for $40 deal. We ordered an extra large vegan delight pizza, Vegan sausage parmigiana hot sandwich (with fries included), angel bites and vegan cheesecake (wasn't on the menu, our waitress recommended it). It was all extremely delicious! The waitress was wonderful and the food was great. I believe the owner or manager was going around and talking with customers and making sure they were having a good time. I would gladly come here again, and would not hesitate to recommend them, I am sure their non vegan items are just as good!"}
{"text":"I just had to chime in with Dave to balance out the ratings on this place. It was some of the boringest (is that a word), blandest pizza ever. I've had better frozen pizzas.  Not only that, the one time I ate there, the dining room was cold as the Grinch's heart, and there was a REALLY-LOUD-TALKING lady there, whose voice boomed throughout the entire establishment."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The only draw back is while we were eating, they were cleaning up the place and stacking chairs. We asked when they close and they didn't close for another hour and a half. Even though the waitress told us not to rush and they were just cleaning up, it did make us feel rushed. Not ideal to eat while there are chairs stacked around you. I would do a take out next time but won't go in."}
{"text":"4.3/5 Would have given a higher rating if...  I got the meatball sub and fries which were both excellent. Probably had 6 large meatballs that were moist but not rubbery. The fries looked like they were handmade and very salty which I enjoyed. I rated this place a 4 but would have probably given them a five if:  1 - The food didn't take so long. There was no one in front of me and it took 19 minutes.  2 - If they actually got my order right. Note that I am reviewing the meatball sub, however I ordered the chicken parmesan sub which it clearly read on my receipt. When the kid brought the food to my table I noticed he picked up the receipt, noted the mistake, got nervous and crumpled it up. I would have sent it back but I had limited time on my lunch hour.   Overall I would go back but would allot more time in the event of a mistake."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have never actually been to Pizza Heaven. I have only ever ordered delivery (like 10 + times) and every single time it is awesome! The food arrives fast, hot and delicious. It's super easy to order online, through their website, and it's relatively inexpensive for all of the food your receive. I typically get the Baked Ziti which is so good and leaves me with plenty of leftovers. My boyfriend either gets a pizza or a hot sandwich and has never been unhappy. Love that we have such a great option for delivery in our neighborhood. We will have to stop by the actual restaurant sometime because it looks so cute!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Patricia, the owner personally reached out to me after reading my review from 2 weeks ago and apologized for what happened and my experience. She offered to come our next meal if we would give her another chance.   I called last night to order 2 large pizzas and asked for Patricia. She remembered who I was and again sincerely apologized. She also better explained their computer system as to why she couldn't give me a refund and it made more sense. It's because they use GrubHub, a 3rd party transaction system.   She kept her word to comp our entire meal and we ordered a Margherita and Miko Miko, both larges. She apologized again and even rushed our order. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and the delivery driver was at our door by 7:15.   I appreciate owners who own their business in more ways than one. She definitely did and I'm satisfied with calling our previous experience with Pizza Heaven a \"one off.\""}
{"text":"Great place to go! We got 10 piece wings for an appetizer along with 5 breadsticks with a large BBQ chicken pizza. Everything here was exceptional. The space is perfect. A nice cozy place with great food. We paid $30.32 for everything."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza place you will EVER find!! I've been ordering here for years and they keep getting better and better Everytime!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to load up on carbs before the Arizona Rock n Roll Marathon since there was a lucrative Groupon available. From the get-go service was a highlight. The owner, Patricia, was very attentive and accommodating since we sat outside and one of the heaters wasn't working. It didn't stop there, though. She and her staff were great, even the in-training waiter that served us. The baked ziti, spaghetti with meatballs, slice of pizza, jalapeño poppers, and angel bites were all perfect for us. The restaurant claims to make everything in-house and the taste of it made it hard to deny. Great local Phoenix spot!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Wings are good the breadsticks are super great.     Service is quick and really nice people their.  The owner is funny"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! They are one of only a handful of restaurants in the Phoenix area who serve good vegan pizza- and a variety of them, too. They have some other vegan dishes which I haven't tried, but the fact that they offer vegan ranch to accompany fries or pizzas is AWESOME!  An issue came up recently, however, and I hope someone with the restaurant reads these reviews and takes it as constructive criticism and makes a change. I was leaving a movie with my family when we decided to order take out. I checked the menu on my phone so we could choose our order and noticed there weren't sizes, only 3 prices. We wanted two medium pizzas, so when I called in that's what I ordered. After I placed the order my BF wanted to verify we got the right size, so I called back and asked to confirm we got mediums and how big those were. I was told mediums are 12\", larges are 14\", and extra larges are 16\". They don't carry a \"small.\" The smallest size they offer is called a medium. Let that sink in.   Had I not called back to check, my family would have been very disappointed. The person I spoke with over the phone offered no sympathy or explanation of why the middle of the three prices on their website (again, the menu they have available to view on their website gives three PRICES, not size names or measurements) is the SMALLEST PIZZA. I get wanting to have branded sizing but even at Starbucks if you ask for a small coffee they know you want the \"tall\".   My recommendation- just call the smallest pizza you offer a \"small,\" the middle size a \"medium,\" and the largest a \"large.\" Or call them 12\", 14\", 16\" and know that if someone asks for a medium, they want a 14\". Also, and this is important, put that information on your website, not just the prices.   I love this place and I hate to criticize, but I doubt I'm the only one this has happened to."}
{"text":"I had the vegan meatball parm hero. It was very good. I was surprised the cheese was so good. I want to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night and absolutely loved it.  I am a vegan but my family is not so it was perfect for all of us to have options.  My vegan veggie sandwich was awesome.  The owner explained all of the vegan options and even gave us some delicious samples to try.  We will defiantly be back.  I can't wait to come back for the buffalo style veggie balls with vegan ranch.  :-)"}
{"text":"I live here 5 years. Where this restaurant is on a 4 block strip with 2 dozen new restaurants. This is an old timer family restaurant. It brings me back repeatedly. The pizzas are superb, the entrees such as Chicken Parmigiana with spaghetti are great tasting and huge portions. And they have a vegan menu for a few of my friends who are vegan and they liked all they ordered. Highly recommend Pizza Heaven Bistro."}
{"text":"Best pasta sauce I've ever had! Huge vegan selection. The vegan ravioli and Mediterranean pizza were awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I wish there was lower than 1 star.  We will never return even though it is close to our location.  I can accept that they made errors on the large pick up order or that it was unbelievable late so that we were late to return back to work.  I cannot believe how they treated the staff whom they blamed for delaying our order.  Treating people this way is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and excellent customer service. Pizza Heaven Bistro catered a large event for me and the quality and friendliness of staff exceeded my expectations. Will definitely be catering from them in the future."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST vegan pizza I've ever had. Everything I've ate from the vegan menu has been great."}
{"text":"Not bad!  The fam and I went out for dinner tonight, and the Husband was happy to discover that Pizza Heaven not only has gluten-free pizza, but wings and pasta too!  A gluten-free trifecta!  It is great to have so many options, and the pizza and honey-hot wings were fairly tasty... but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  Just a basic casual pizza spot, where you won't be terribly embarrassed if your 4-year-old throws a temper tantrum.  Umm.. not that that happened to us, or anything...   The highest point was the service.  Our server was incredibly attentive and took great care of us.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We ended up here because they offer gluten-free crusts and my bff has celiac disease.  The atmosphere was fun - neighborhood feel and evidently live music every weekend night.  There were four of us and we all got pizzas. They were good - but not my favorite, although I blame it on having opted for the gluten-free crust. It was good - don't get me wrong - but nothing like the gluten-saturated stuff I'm accustomed to.   We gave this place a second try for takeout and my world changed - best veggie sandwich ever! It was huge, on a great roll, wit hall kinds of cooked veggies and a great marinara sauce. I crave it on a consistent basic actually.   Great options for neighborhood flare with gluten free and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The name is so fitting! Pizza heaven has a vegan menu that almost made me cry. We got meatless balls, a pizza, and cheesecake and it was all amazing! It was a really cute place and the staff was super friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Warning. Even their  Alfredo sauce has garlic unlike the vast  majority of recipes for Alfredo sauce. They work hard to have vegan food and then stick it to the large numbers of folks that are allergic and or intolerant to garlic."}
{"text":"They had a great special one topping extra large for 1299 well that pizza has now gone up to $21 so I'm out it was a good run while it lasted"}
{"text":"I hate to do this because the people there were very nice. However! Last night was the first time going to Pizza Heaven. I have heard good things about it so I figured I would give it a try. I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and 10 hot wings to go. When I got to my car I took a couple bites of the pizza and was pretty disappointed. It had very little flavor, and the crust was to crispy with very little flavor.      After I got home I ate a couple more slices and ended up throwing the rest away. I then tried the wings. Disappointed again!! Extremely strong pepper flavor and very little sauce. It tasted like pepper flavored backed chicken.     The worst part about this was, this was a splurge for. I haven't been off my diet in a very long time. I guess I won't be going back to pizza heaven."}
{"text":"New favorite vegan italian! Id feel better giving a 5 star if they were 100% vegan, but their menu was fantastic. Baked ziti and soy sausage was incredible, and their calzone was one of the best ive ever had in general. Patricia visited our table and offered us to try their angel bites as a desert, which was scrumptious. Since my experience was based strictly off of their vegan menu, they definitely earned the stars. This was my first time visiting and would definitely stop by again when i get the chance."}
{"text":"So. Good! I had a vegan delight pizza. I think they use Daiya cheese, that's what it tasted like but they don't use a lot (at least on this particular item) so it was subtle and perfect. They use a soy-based sausage that was so yummy, spiced so it wasn't bland. The boyfriend had a calzone with pepperoni and he was very happy with it. Items are a little pricey-especially the extra charges for adding extra items like veggies-and the service could have been faster but it still deserves five stars for that perfect vegan pizza."}
{"text":"If you're a wing lover, this is a place you should try!!!!! The suicide sauce is delicious but do is every other sauce. I get these wings all the time just for that amazing wing sauce. I have tried the slices of pizza and wouldn't recommend them unfortunately. There is too much oregano or some green spice that ruins the taste of the pizza, but whatever I still get wings all the time! Amazing!"}
{"text":"At last, a restaurant that serves delicious pasta that, upon request, can be made as a gluten-free option! My friend and fellow yelper John M. had a very good dining experience at this restaurant and invited me to have dinner there with him so I can try it out - and I'm glad he did. It's a cozy little bistro with its own parking area - a plus for this part of 7th Avenue. The staff is very friendly and service was quick.  My order, penne al greco (I chose the gluten-free option with brown rice penne), had feta, spinach, calamata olives, sun dried tomatoes, and zucchini; it can only be described as heavenly.  It was truly ambrosia, and I chose beer as my nectar. I'm looking forward to trying more dishes at this restaurant really soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizzas to be delivered as a surprise for my long-distance boyfriend and his friends who were visiting him in Phoenix. I live in LA, so I really had no idea where to order from, but this place seemed to have the best options and the most stars on both Yelp and GrubHub. I called at exactly 10:30am when they opened on Saturday morning, and the person on the phone was so awesome and patient with me, not only agreeing to include a personalized note (which I was hesitant to do and he convinced me it was a cute idea), but he let me think about what to write and call back when I finally figured it out. My BF loved the pizza (and the note).  He sent me a pic of the pizzas and they looked absolutely amazing!! This place rocks and I've never had better customer service while ordering takeout.  I'm definitely stopping by next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've tried ordering something different Every time and it blows my fucking mind how good it is. Don't think about going here- just do it. It will melt your face off : in the best way possible."}
{"text":"Best pasta I've had in a while! I dined in once for lunch on a weekday and was literally the only customer. Server was nice, but did forget a few things. I'm a server myself, so I know when the restaurant is slow, I tend to forget more. No biggie :) mozzarella sticks are yummy, hot, and waaay more filling than you think! I took half of those home (order of 6). I asked what pasta the waiter recommended out of the two I was on the fence about and ended up with the tequila lime chicken... AMAZING. Spicy, succulent sauce that made the whole dish. Jalapeños that are sautéed and add a nice level of heat and texture as well. The sauce was super delicious dipped in the focaccia bread!!  I've ordered to go as well. Got the same pasta and the hot wings (extra crispy). They delivered so quickly! The hot wings are hot, but have actual FLAVOR and depth unlike a lot of \"hot wings\" out there, so they appear less hot than you would think. (Highly recommend). The pasta was just as good as the first time, but the noodles got a little softer in the delivery process.  I seriously love this place. Good lunch specials, awesome, authentic food, and fast delivery. I still need to try their pizza and a bunch else, cause everything looks so good! Thank you, Pizza Heaven Bistro :)"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven is like the goldilocks of the Pizza food world. When you're looking for something juuuust right. The food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Phoenix seems to possess many pizza gems. Add this joint to that list. Most of the time I made delivery orders from these guys but occasionally I did go and eat there with friends.    Since I have been eating here for the past two years I have had a chance to sample a lot of their menu. In terms of pizza the best thing on it is the Queen Margherita. In terms of components its a fairly simple pizza: tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. However, the pizza is well put together and you can taste the quality of the ingredients. Its a little on the pricey side in my opinion but its well worth it.   My second favorite pizza is the bianca which is an amalgamation of different cheeses. They offer ricotta on the pizza for a little extra but in my opinion it takes away from the bianca experience so don't bother with it. Now the Bianca has no red sauce which means it lacks a certain zest in my opinion. This is why I recommend getting a side order of marinara  to dip the pizza in. Eat the pizza fast though because like many things it does not taste good cold.  Im doing this review ass backwards here but in terms of appetizers their mozzarella sticks are pretty damn good. Make sure to request that they are the last thing out of the oven so that they are piping hot. Their other appetizers in my opinion are not of the same caliber so I would avoid them.  If you aren't in the mood for pizza try one of there delicious calzones which you can easily make two meals out of. This place has without a doubt the best calzones in the phoenix area.  Like their appetizers Pizza Heaven's pasta dishes are not one of their strong suits and should be avoided unless you enjoy the taste of mediocrity.     Your best bet when it comes to dessert is the Chocolate Mousse which I gotta say is pretty damn good. After having ordered from them over 50 times I asked if I get any sort of reward for my commitment and so they hooked it up with a slice of the Mousse. The cheesecake on the other hand was unimpressive. If you want cheesecake go to the cheesecake factory.  On balance Pizza Heaven is a decent joint and while its pizza is far from heavenly its kinda close, like one notch above purgatory...just kidding."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  We (4 people) got to the restaurant at 7:45 and waited approx 10 minutes to be seated.  Another 10 min til order was taken.  Then waited over an hour - the appetizers did not even come.  Someone came by and said they would check on it for us and nothing.  I went up after an hour with no food and said we wanted it to go and the check.  It took another 10 min to get the food to go and they charged us the full amount. The servers kept saying the restaurant was so busy but at 9pm we were one of only a few tables.  The tables around us got served before us.  I asked for a manager and they said they were getting one.  Then they said only the kitchen manager was present and there was nothing he could do.  They refunded $10 to the bill and now we are driving home with soggy cold food at 9:30pm.  Absurd.  I will be calling the restaurant tomorrow and hopefully getting in touch with a manager.    Why does this thing make you put one star?  This is a zero star review!!!!  ................ UPDATED:  I just spoke with the owner Patricia who is going to make this right for me and my family.  She is a sweetheart!    We have to give business the opportunity to right a wrong and she went above and beyond to turn the experience around.    I will return and thank you to the owner for caring enough to reach out to me!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times now over the years. Surprised it has taken me so long to review it. Maybe, I thought I had. Anyway. Great location. It used to be more south. It was a cool little hole in the wall back then. Now it is more like a cool little family restaurant.  They play live music even on certain days. THe food is good, the atmosphere is not too bad.It is a nice place to go and not too bad on the wallet. On a busy day or night parking can be tight. But,  other wise it is great. Check it out one day when you are on the East side of pghoenix. You just might like it."}
{"text":"I appreciate the vegan and GF option on the menu. While I can pretty much eat anything across the board, enough of my dining buddies have restrictions that are made far less a hassle with this menu!  I've been in a few times through the years - always happy with the service and pizza.  Recently, we've had them deliver to my office a few times. I'm a fan because if I am (gasp!) not in the mood for pizza, I can get a small salad and breadsticks.   Everything has been fresh, quality and presentation solid - and I am consistently a happy camper!  Definitely a nice place to have in my work and home area - and so much better than any of the chains!"}
{"text":"This may have been a bad night however, the wait after being seated was over an hour. The veggieballs are just some kind of flour reminiscent of corn flour and a few veg thrown in, the vegan sausage sandwich was more like meatless ground tossed in some marinara that tasted okay but seemed to come from a jar. The Italian dressing, supposedly vegan, was just bad. According to Jason, the steak sandwich was like what you get in a package at Costco. Not bad taste, just generic.  They didn't bring the veggieballs with the other non-vegan appetizers and the meal as a whole was delayed so long we thought the order was forgotten. We almost walked out twice.  Not so sure I'm going back to this place"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a long time now so finally stopped in for dinner.  Staff is friendly and attentive \"live music\" is a keyboard player so that was a downer for sure.  Had BBQ agave wings which were cooked perfect but for our personal taste had little to much sauce.  Then ordered a medium \"the works\" overall the pizza was pretty good had a little issue with the texture of the ground meat but I think we will be back."}
{"text":"You could not ask for better food, better service ir a better experience. This is THE BISTRO for when you are in downtiwn Phoenix. They have signature drinks and  AMAZING lunch specials. They are known for being a traditional italian bistro that actually provides tasy vegan and gluten free options. My pregnant wife just cannot get enough of the spagghetti and meatballs that comes with their fresh baked bread. Guys... this bread.. I do not know what they did with it. But it makes the name \"heaven\" in their title make sense. The wait staff is out of this world and the owner Patricia is not  only present at the bistro but she will take care of ANY issues. Thus making it a REAL italian bistro. Family owned and operated. So filled with love. In the live music, the food and the people. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time since living in Phx. This pizza place was the closest to my house, that was a huge plus. I went with a group of friends (total of 4) and decided to sit outside since it was overcast and nice weather. We all got appetizers and a large pizza to share.   Jalepeno poppers - were so amazing!! the cream cheese inside was melted so perfectly.  Wings - were a little vinegary for my taste but still enjoyed the mild sauce dipped in my ranch  French fries - so golden and delicious   Pizza - we created our own and added our toppings. Big slices and satisfying   We also went during happy hour so their beers special was nice and cheap   Overall, a nice little place to dine in. The prices were really affordable and the timing with the food was not questionable. We just wish they had more selections with their alcoholic drinks, but that was really no biggie"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from this place so I can't comment on the atmosphere. I honestly was not impressed with the pizza. It's great that it was vegan but the sauce was average and was what mostly covered the pizza rather than vegan cheese or vegan sausage.  I loved the vegan meatballs I ordered as a side though. They were excellent in the marinara sauce That's all I had here. It was okay. Just had to give it a try and see if it was good. I don't  know if I would come here again. I normally like the pizza if the dough is good but I guess it just felt a bit too tough for my liking."}
{"text":"Pizza heaven first caught my eye at it's original location, on the corner of Highland and 7th st.  The building was old, fairly cramped and didn't have much to offer in aesthetic. However, as I could very nearly hit it with a baseball from my condo, I had to at least give it a shot.   I was not disappointed.   The pizza, wings, pasta and sandwiches are all excellent, and every employee I have encountered has been very friendly. The restaurant has now moved up 7th street to a new location that is more representative of the quality of the food and service. A great place to grab a quick slice for lunch, or a full pie and a beer (or six) in the evenings. A flyer in the restaurant claims they have live music on the weekends, although I haven't yet witnessed this.    Overall, great quality and variety. Pepperoni, mushroom, pepperocini on wheat crust FTW!"}
{"text":"4th gluten free pizza - do not order this option.   The crust was burnt, the buffalo mozzarella was melted but not browned and the sausage was swimming betwixt the sauce and cheese.  I've ordered the soy cheese and soy sausage three times - once was it made well.  I'm not a fan of so-called real pizza and I'll bet the traditional pizza there is good. BUT If a restaurant charges these higher price for gluten & soy options (of which I'll pay) - you'd better do them at a C level not D-.  4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options. Do yourself & customers a favor and take them off the menu."}
{"text":"We went to pizza heaven on a Tuesday evening, with the exception of one person sitting reading a book we were the only people in the restaurant. I wasn't sure if I should be happy or scared that the place was empty.    Overall the pizza was great. We were simple, cheese and pepperoni. We also ordered wings, half medium and half honey hot BBQ, both were HOT!!   They don't have milk for kids, if you have kids you know that this is important. They don't have draft beer but they said they were working on getting some.   I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"Placed a catering order for my office this week. Excellent service and amazing food!! Pizza, Wings and Salad for 50. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch on a whim... my car was being worked on next door. They had great lunch specials and very reasonable! I had a slice with their homemade sausage. The pizza had a nice crispy crust, not too thin or thick. I sat on the patio with a great slice of pizza and a very cold beer and enjoy talking with the owner! She was wonderful and I could tell the care and pride she showed in her recipes and her restaurant showed in the pizza and service!"}
{"text":"After having dinner here previously I said I wouldn't be back, because of the staff. I am so glad I decided to give this place another chance. The wings & pizza are my favorite. Perfect crust and very tasty. The wings are súper meaty and the buffalo sauce is to die for. Patricia the owner is such a sweetheart. She has definitely been working hard on training her staff, and it showed tonight. She toke her time and made sure we where been taking care of and even spend time getting to know us and our kiddos. She when out of her way to accommodate me tonight. I definitely appreciated her. I am looking forward to my next visit. Keep up the good work, I was highly impressed."}
{"text":"My friends come here all the time and now I understand why.   We ordered the combo pizza and was quite impressed there were a ton of ingredients on top.  They obviously did not skimp on our pizza.  I only wish I could have taken home the leftovers (my friend took them home). We were there chatting for a while and the stream of people were pretty constant.  Worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Good pizza, not the best I've ever had.  It's cheap; you can get 2 cheese slices & a drink for $4. $0.50 per topping per slice.  Friendly staff, but the service is a little bit slow.  My friend had to wait 47 min for his pizza last Tuesday, but usually it's not that bad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The breadsticks are really tasty and bigger than most. The Carnivora and Bianca taste sooo delicious. It is a bit greasy but the crust is perfect. The place is small and gets really busy so plan to wait but it is worth wait."}
{"text":"I would never have stopped in or tried this Pizzeria if it hadn't been for a Living Social offer. I'm happy I purchased the offer after our first try. Pizza and wings were amazing. Second time around wasn't quite as impressive as the first. The joint has a private party out on the front patio and the service inside of the restaurant suffered a bit. Various tables remained dirty for quite some time. Our pizza didn't have quite as much sauce and not enough Pepperoni. Overall, I love the feel of this place and hope the second trip was just a fluke. PS...Their Wings are the Bomb!!! :) Cheers***"}
{"text":"We like this place because it is right down the road from our apartment and works well as a meeting place for friends.  The best part is they have both Vegan and Gluten Free options.  This makes it great for when we want to gather with our closest friends who run fall all over the food spectrum.    The pizza is good.  I'm from Chicago so I'm picky about my pizza as nothing is ever as good as my home town staple.  But I enjoy this place.  The crust is good, not too dry and airy.  The only thing I don't like is that their thin crust is not a true thin crust in my eyes.  I like crispy thin crust but it is still a good crust.  The pizza was not oily or greasy at all.  We've had pepperoni,  sausage, and ham and pineapple on our pizza.  My boyfriend has had the wings and they smelled good to me and appeared to taste good as he polished them off.  We've had their pizza dine in and carry out and really have no complaints.  My only other dislike is that the pizza is not as good the next morning.  Yes I judge pizza based on it's taste as cold leftovers.  But, I love cold pizza so this is a huge scoring point for me.  It's a great little neighborhood spot that we will continue to visit."}
{"text":"The sausage spaghetti was spicy and flavorful and came out piping hot. The pizza was very good as well."}
{"text":"I go to Pizza Heaven all the time and every time it is a great place to dine at! The atmosphere can suit multiple occasions. Whether it be a romantic dinner date, a dinner party, or even a family outing. The food is always delicious especially when it comes to the calzones and pizza selections. I am not a vegetarian but I have dabbled in a few of Pizza Heaven's vegan items and I must say that they are pretty delicious. Another great food item at this place is their wings and breadsticks are incredible. When it comes to lunch the meal deals are affordable and filling. Not to mention the portions are Pizza Heaven are amazing. You definitely get more than what you pay for! Also the wait is never too long and the service is always friendly. The owners are always nice enough to always come out and talk to each costumer. I wish Yelp had more than five stars to rate Pizza Heaven!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant find for us. What a cute place outside and an intimate dining area. Nice service and pizza was really yummy. No hesitation returning or referring."}
{"text":"Still a fan of the pizza but the service Friday evening didn't impress me. They weren't very busy but the service was VERY slow. We were told the patio heater over the empty table we wanted was not operational, so we had to sit in a booth indoors, only to see the heater working just fine for another party on our way out of the restaurant. The live music was nice but lots of breaks for the singer, as she would do 1 or 2 songs and disappear for a bit and come back :20 later and do another few. Not impressed this visit."}
{"text":"ATTN ALL GLUTEN FREE AND/ OR VEGAN CONSUMERS: eat here and you won't be sorry. Best gluten free pizza I have tried to date so it to is well worth the price. My friend got a vegan pizza and was very happy with it as well. Plus gluten free pasta, gluten free Alfredo sauce made in house as well as vegan and gluten free cheesecake also made in house. This place really is heaven."}
{"text":"Was out on that side of town and was jonesin' for some pizza. Read a lot of the other positive reviews and I guess I'm joining the club. The puzza was great! Can't think of anything negative about my visit. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Loved the fresh crust ... I'm super picky about the crust and it was perfect! They delivered it hot and fast to my work!!! I ordered the carnivores pizza that had bacon, Italian sausage crumbles and pepperoni!!! Amazing combination. I have a new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely amazing VEGAN options. We had the bbq pizza and spaghetti with veggie balls they both were very high quality. The pizza was one of the best I've ever had vegan or not.  We will be making this a regular spot. Major bonus they have really delicious vegan ranch dressing. I love this place so happy I finally gave it a try."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday to celebrate the birthday boy. We absolutely loved it! Terrific menu and they take pride in their pizza for sure. Salads were good, wings had just the right zip, and dessert was one hundred percent delicious!! Now, I have had MANY slices of new york style cheesecake, but this is hands down the BEST. Owner passes by your table to check on things and live music on weekends is terrific. The musicians even paused from their set to sing happy birthday and present us with free dessert. Cute! Sure made his day :-) Dough is made fresh here, sausage is made fresh here ...and if you have a special request or a diet restriction? No problem, just mention it and you are in good Italian hands."}
{"text":"\"...Oh it's you sweet baby I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby Only hopin' it's not too late to try again It's you sweet baby Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby I will always be right there by your side, right by your side...\" (George Duke - Sweet Baby)   I'm sappy, I know!   Pining (yearning deeply) for my wife, as we enjoy our evening together in this beautiful Friday evening.  It was hard to withhold my emotions when the apartment across the street, brought back a memory of what seemed like ages past.  I was in college then, and I was picking up some friends at that complex - since I was always the designated driver. As I waited for my friends to get ready, I would sing this song out in the balcony.   And when my friends came out of their apartment, they would immediately make fun of me stating, \"There goes Stephen again singing to the trees!\" They'd get a big laugh out of it, and encourage me to quit singing and go meet some girls.   Little did they know that my heart was already smitten by then, and all these years later, that girl sits across from me to this very day! Many years may have passed, but the passing of time hasn't diminished my passion for her.   Her presence still moves me in ways that I can never explain, nor ever take for granted!  We wound up here because this was finals week, and she wasn't wanting to endure the normal prolonged wait for any of our regular haunts in Mid-Town Phoenix. Also, we just wanted a change in venue, and the promise of Live Music was as much a draw, as the promise of great pizza and wings.  We ordered a Large Special with Mild Wings. For added measure, we also ordered a small dinner salad.  Juan, our server, was just so friendly. He was polite, prompt, and propitious. He was attentive to all the pertinent details regarding our dining experience, and was careful enough to explain all the particulars. He really seemed like he enjoyed what he did, and it really did show.  An added bonus to our dining experience was the addition of the promised Live Music entertainment. A pretty young lady, with an angelic voice, was singing a variety of songs while playing her guitar. Her musical accompaniment was a gentleman playing a Yamaha Keyboard, who at times also sang the background vocals.   Both entertainers were very adept at their craft, and the variety of their selection of music was quite pleasing - especially some of the love songs that she belted out. It truly made for a wonderful backdrop to our overall experience.  When the pizza and the wings arrived, they were as good as the other reviewers had mentioned. Perhaps, not the very best that we have ever tasted, but certainly well above average.  We like thin crust pizza, with all the toppings, and the crust not being overdone. And our pizza was just perfect in this regard - neither under-cooked or overcooked. This then, resulted in the toppings retaining their wonderful flavor; as well as, the crust not having that burnt taste that often accompanies a poorly prepared pizza.  The sauce on the wings were not overly saliferous, which enabled my wife to enjoy them - even though she doesn't often eat wings. This was a  good testament to their moderation when preparing the wings bathed in hot sauce.  It was just a perfect dining experience to share with my Beloved!  And as we walked up to pay at the front counter; the manager, the other servers, and Juan all asked us if we enjoyed our dining experience. It's one thing to ask, but they all seemed so sincere about their inquiry that it gave us a warm feeling that this place not only serves great food, has great entertainment on the weekends, but they also have staff and management that truly cares about their customer.  This may not be the fanciest, or largest dining establishments in the area; but their diminutive building size belies the immensity of their caring service!"}
{"text":"My new pizza place! Ordered pizza delivery for the first time and got it in 35 minutes. Pizza crust was just how I like it and it still retained some crispness after traveling in the box. The ingredients, cheese, and sauce were flavorful and distinctive. This was a good pie and the delivery guy was friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery.  The spaghetti was terrible, it had a weird taste to it! No effort!  The  cheese on the pizza was thick and chewy!  I don't know why this place has 4 stars.  Maybe if you dine in this place delivers 4 star quality food.  Pizza Hell!"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and picky about pizza.  Phoenix just doesn't have good pizza and Pizza Heaven is the best I've found so far.  I like the different pizza options, and I have found the gluten free options helpful!  My usual pizza is the carnivori, but lately I haven't liked it as much.  I suggest asking for extra sauce on this pizza (their sauce is good).  I think my new favorite pizza is the BBQ chicken pizza.  It has a good taste and has nice big hunks of chicken on it.  I have not tried their other menu items yet.  Pizza Heaven is the only pizza place I keep coming back to.  They were also able to take care of my order of 4 pizzas in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The quality of food here is fantastic. Very good value for the price. They are happy to customize anything for you, especially the pizza. There are vegetarian options. Good salads and sandwiches. Tasty pasta dishes. Free wifi. They sometimes have live entertainment that not everyone appreciates (psst, the musician is the owner's son) - if that's you, just order takeout. The pizza here is better than anywhere else in a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"We met 2 others inside, but it was pretty dark, so we opted for the small patio out front. Nice little patio, but pretty loud traffic as it was right on 7th street. Service was very good and friendly. It was 5:00 on a Friday, but no happy hour. Very few beer options, but did have one good IPA on tap. We ordered The Mediteranean with the hand tossed crust. It was ok, but maybe better with thin crust? All in all a decent little pizza place, but hard to compete with the likes of Pomo and some other pizza options downtown."}
{"text":"Went here with 11 of my friends on an early Saturday night. They had plenty of room to accommodate us all... they only messed up 1 order, considering our group size that wasn't too bad.  I got the hand tossed pizza... I think I would have preferred the thin crust. I was told they had NY style pizza but to me the standard hand tossed crust was too thick to be called NY style. NY style needs to fold easily and you need to give it a minute in its folded state to drip out the excess grease. The folding action was challenging and not nearly as greasy as I expected... I have to say that I still very much enjoyed my pizza. The sauce had a nice spice and the cheese was gooey. I think I'll have to try it again with the thin crust and perhaps my 4-star will go to 5-star. Others ordered entrees from the menu and everyone was quiet when eating (always a good sign of good food when you're too busy eating to talk)."}
{"text":"All I can say is omgosh it was definitely Heavenly!!!  I placed a togo order to the buffalo veggies balls which were amazballs,  and the vegan vegetarian pizza adding vegan sausage.  Had to be the of the best vegan pizza's I've ever had.  From the moment the cashier placed my food in my hands I knew it would be good.  Just the smell of it alone had my mouth watering. I had intended on taking it home but I had no patience. The smells kept poking me in my shoulder saying eat me,  eat me,  eat me NOW!!! So I did.   I sat in my car and at all 6 veggie balls with my fingers with no utensils or napkins.  I can say they were finger kicking good,  but I would have preferred a fork.  But no biggie,  they were thoroughly enjoyed.  I then proceeded to attempt my 18 min ride home with the pizza riding in the passengers side staring at me but I broke down and had a slice on the way home.  I just couldn't resist.  As soon as I got home I ate 4 more slices.  I'm stuffed and am a happy camper. But I will have my running shoes on in the morning.   Would highly suggest to amy vegan/non vegan customer.  Customer service was cool too. I'd put bible scriptures on the boxes too. Heavenly idea ."}
{"text":"I had the day off of work last Monday so decided to celebrate with some pizza.  I had never been to Pizza Heaven before, but pass it every day on 7th Street on my way home from work.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with true ambience (rare in the strip mall Phoenix culture).  Orders are placed in the front and a number is provided to you.  I have to say that the guy taking the order was helpful and courteous.  I had some questions and he answered them with a smile - not an attitude!  I ended up sharing a Greek style salad (it had artichokes and a red vinegar/oil olive dressing = Greek style).  The portion was generous and the salad as delicious.  The main course was an extra large thick crust pizza.   It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was simple, yet tasty.  Pizza Heaven is suitable for adults and children alike.    I will be back.................!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza. It's not the greatest pizza I have ever had. It is, however, the best I have add thus far in Arizona in the 6 years I have lived here."}
{"text":"Love this spot! They have the best vegan pizza. I am hooked! My husband had the regular pizza and he really liked his as well!"}
{"text":"Judging by some of these reviews, I believe that anything four or five stars was done by someone who went from domino's to this.  I've been to this place several times... it's family owned, it's clean, but pizza heaven it is not.  Their pizza is good and nothing more.  I liked it, but it wasn't out of this world, I had the Pizza Bianca and it does not deserve 5 stars. It's OK. that's it.  I really don't understand how places like this on yelp get such high reviews, but I have a theory:  People who do not venture out beyond their safe zone develop a relative reality.  Let's just say this about Pizza Heaven: There wasn't anything bad about the place.  They have music sometimes, but it's a duo fronted by the owner's son.  They're so-so, just like the pizza, no wrong notes, but I won't be buying their album soon.  I wouldn't come here unless I was invited by someone, in which I would still come, but I can think of 20 pizza places that are better than this and many of those 20 are cheaper."}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to try this place for months and unfortunately I was a bit underwhelmed.  The pizza was alright, but I don't know if i would crave it again."}
{"text":"I had a little piece of 'Heaven'!!! Pizza Heaven that is!! I drive by this place every single day, thinking...hmmmm, I need to try this place. With it being on 7th St, the cars go by so fast, its hard for me to slow down my car to check it out. So, today I stopped on it. (Please note there is limited parking) So I walk in, pleasantly surprised to see a really nice establishment. Nice waiting area for To Go orders with 2 high top tables and a lunch counter. The menu is displayed really largely above the entrance to the dining room, so easy to read. They have take away menus to look at too. The guy at the counter was really pleasant as well. Now on to the food!  There was so much to choose from, including homemade lasagna, pizza, pasta, ravioli, sandwichs etc.  Very appealing menu options, I could hardly decide! Please note, they have gluten free and wheat options for crust and vegan and organic items too!! Great for ANYONE! I decided on the meal deal: 1 slice of pizza (1 topping), side salad, and 1 pop (or soda as AZ people say). All for $5.50 ($6.01 total) Great deal. So it only took around 5 mins and my order was ready. The pizza looked great! Not greasy and it had quality cheese and toppings and a good size slice! I got the mushroom as my topping (so good). The crust was crisp and delish. And the side salad was a nice healthy size as well. It has carrots, tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage slices on it. And the dressing, I chose was ranch. In fact, the dressing was that \"restaurant ranch\" that only true ranch dressing lovers will truely understand. :o) Great flavor  (not a glue-type quality like some places serve)  Overall, great staff, nice setting, and good food! I will definitely not just drive by this place anymore, I will stop in more often!! :o)"}
{"text":"If you want fresh, homemade, and absolutely delicious pizzas and entrees, this is the spot! The pizzas are the best I've had in Phoenix and even, yes, in New York! To top it off, it's locally owned and operated with kind and passionate staff!  This place has something for everyone and for me, they have VEGAN!  And get this my VEGAN and allergic friends, if any are reading this, no fear to eat out here ---- they have a notebook with all ingredients listed for your review!  Hands down Italian vegan food!  Very unique dishes and it's not plane Jane food!  Flavors will pop in your mouth and you will quickly become addicted!  Homemade breads and crusts that you won't believe!  I want to eat everything at once!  From the pizzas, to the calzones, the meatballs, the pastas, everything is amazing here!  If you haven't been, I strongly encourage you to drop by and then you will for sure be a regular!  Oh, I left out the yummy desserts too!! Amongst the non-vegan desserts, they also have homemade vegan cheesecake and doughnuts!  Absolutely the best restaurant I've found in town, seriously!  I want to call out Sean that has been so welcoming and is friendly and kind when I'm asking for special requests on my pizza!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering so I wasn't sure what to expect. Let's start with the good - my delivery was on time....my email confirmation gave the time of 7:23 and my food arrived at 7:21...my food was hot and my order was complete.  5 Stars - Delivery  5 Stars  - Cheesecake - Delicious  4 Stars - free breadsticks - I prefer mine more crispy, but they were free and the marinara sauce it comes with was fulll of flavor.  2 1/2 Stars - Calzone with pepperoni and broccoli - the filling was tasty, but the calzone was too doughy for my taste. l would not order again.  2 1/2 Stars  - Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and spinach.   The chicken was questionable...the sauce is more of a buttery garlic sauce rather than a cheesy Alfredo sauce. I would not order again.   Not giving up on them yet, will order again especially that cheesecake which was delicious."}
{"text":"The food was decent - we had pizza and salad - nothing special. Impressed by the gluten-free and vegan options. What really disappointed me was the customer service. Early on in our meal, when the waiter was delivering the salad, somehow the dressing flew off the salad plate (it was in a container) and landed on the floor by my feet, getting dressing all over my skirt, shoes, and feet. I had to spend 5 minutes in the bathroom cleaning myself up before I could go out and enjoy my meal.   The thing is, I don't have a problem with mistakes. People make mistakes all the time. But besides his profuse apology for the mistake, there was no action taken to rectify the situation. When our bill came, there wasn't a single discount or credit. In my estimation, when you work in customer service, you have a responsibility to make sure the customer is happy and wants to return to your establishment again. I was not left feeling this way, and for that I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been here a few times for date night and with kids for dinner after work.  We love this place, pizza is excellent and the atmosphere is very relaxing. They have a young guy singing, I believe he is the owners son. He is verrrry talented and I really enjoy listening to him sing. Nothing worse than listening to someone sing and you know they have no talent, but this is not the case with him. When we come to Pizza Heaven its always a treat for us. Good food and entertainment for sure."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have had in Phoenix it is a family owned place with great service our waiter was not only  attentative towards us but James made sure we where  good with our food and comfortable at the same time. I felt like I was at home. I will highly recommend this place to my family and friends and make sure they get helped by James because he made my experience so much better."}
{"text":"Love the vegan menu! The vegan veggie pizza was great( the dough was amazing!) The veggie balls with marinara sauce were great too! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My server, River, was very polite and attended to my every need. He suggested the baked ziti with extra ricotta, and it was delectable! I highly suggest stopping by this restaurant, it is authentic and original."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember or count how many places I have had pizza, probably be in the hundreds.  Well, I love pizza so when I hear about a place or someone suggests going out for dinner, a pizza place (or Italian) is always at the top of my suggestions. So, there is the background.  Pizza Heaven is a pretty nice place. I was there with a group, primarily senior types who are usually not very adventurous and stick to bland, minimally spiced food. What they mostly had, or appeared to have, was just that. So, I ordered a pizza and piled on the red pepper.  The pizza was good on a scale of 1 -10, I would give it about a 7.5. Nothing really stood out, but it was basically put together well. I tend to rate pizza on the high scale as I can usually find something redeeming about most pizza. However, if it is a 5 or below, I would never return. I think I found one of those places about a year ago. Well, if it is a above a 7, I consider the pizza to be good enough to return for and at least give it another try.  Pizza Heaven Bistro had a bit of atmosphere, was doing a pretty good business with casual guests and a birthday party going on one of the side areas. The party goers seemed to be having a good time.  Service was good, food was served quickly and the place was clean. They had a outdoor area, but it was too cold to be out there. Anyway, a good enough place to give a try."}
{"text":"I love it here.  Nice little spot with a great vegan menu . The ravioli and veggie balls are fantastic. I bring my non veg friends here too and they all like it as well."}
{"text":"I hate to say this in a review, but the only thing that comes to mind when I think about this place is, \"I've had better.\"  The dough was not too good, not too bad. The toppings, meh. The sauce was decent. Delivery was not fast, but not excessively slow.  It was definitely an underwhelming experience, but certainly not the worst thing I've ever tasted. I would like to say that the taste and quality do not match the price.  If the management is paying attention, I would like to suggest that you do something amusing and put bible quotes, or something along those lines, on your pizza boxes since you are 'heavenly'. Just a marketing thought."}
{"text":"What a great place to get a vegan pizza in Phoenix. Try the Agave BBQ pizza. Soy sausage, pineapple and BBQ sauce. Don't forget the vegan meatballs tossed in buffalo hot sauce. It ain't a hippie joint so meat eaters won't care. It could get a 5 star if the beer tap was colder and had a few more options. Think traditional Italian place that for some reason has awesome vegan pizza."}
{"text":"Even the name fails to covey what lies inside.  Pizza Heaven is the type of place you could drive by and never even notice however, that would be a mistake because Pizza Heaven Bistro  is a great place to grab Italian food at a reasonable  price.  I have been to Pizza Heaven a few times and have never been disappointed. The menu includes a wide variety of pizzas along with a tasty selection of pasta entrée's.  Pizza Heaven Bistro is fairly small however, they have a robust take out business as well as a very busy dine in traffic.  The food and the service are always good. The atmosphere  feels a bit like home. What more could you asked for.  Good food,  good service,  great prices."}
{"text":"Consistently good food at reasonable prices. I'd rate the pizza above average, but not great. Lunch specials are a good value, and they are available if you ask for them all day long. Relaxing atmosphere, as long as it's not crowded. (Note: Lunch specials are no longer offered all day, which lessens the appeal of this restaurant, in my opinion.)"}
{"text":"Juan, our server, was very friendly and helpful. He gave my boyfriend and I wonderful suggestions since this was our first time here. I had the Cajun Chicken Alfredo which was very delicious and we ordered the Carnivori pizza which was also very delicious. The service was fast and our server was one of the best servers I have met in a while. Thanks Juan!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than Pizza Heaven in my opinion. Staff is always friendly and the food is always delicious! The wings are perfectly crisp, saucy and with their ranch I just can't get enough. My fiance and I rarely can agree on food but we never disagree with pizza heaven. Even the bathroom is amazing, just should have more than 1 since they are always so busy. Keep up with the great service and we'll always come back for another slice of heaven! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party.  We enjoyed the patio and wonderful live music ! The food was delicious and we had excellent service. The owner personally checked in each of us during our meal. Would definitely come back. Very reasonable prices and great service"}
{"text":"First time I got it... I was not impressed.  But let me tell you... ordering a pizza with a whole wheat crust instead of the default crust makes a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE!.  The pizza went from tasting identical to Papa John's (with the normal crust).. to taste phenomenal (with the whole wheat crust)!  So happy I gave this place I second chance!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza Heaven! Been here to eat the restaurant a few times and had delivery once. I'm obsessed with their wings! Weird, I know, since it's a pizza place. Everyone who works here has always been amazing, and they always have a Groupon. I definitely recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Pizza Heaven. I picked this place because of the yelp reviews. Perhaps their regular crust pizza is great but this was by far the worst gluten-free pizza I've ever had(no exaggeration). The crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard. I popped it into the oven to see if I could get e crust crispy but no luck. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really adorable, small, mom and pop pizza place. The atmosphere is laid back and friendly, and the space is nice and cozy. They have live music some nights, and you will quickly realize this is a true family-owned restaurant (and these are becoming less and less these days). I haven't had the pizza here but had numerous salads and pasta dishes. I used to live in the neighborhood and Pizza Heaven was one of my go-tos after a tough day at work when I wanted to order takeout and a chianti before going home to change into cozy stretchy pants and eat delicious carbs!"}
{"text":"So happy to find the Vegan options in a pizza restaurant, I didn't have to order garden salad! My family enjoyed the non vegan pizza too!"}
{"text":"I love this place but very disappointed they took their best sandwich, the pizza grinder, off the menu.  I guess I won't be going here as much now."}
{"text":"Placed a carry out order through grub hub. I got the cajun chicken alfredo and bread sticks. The pasta came to my apartment still piping hot. The meal was good but the noodles were all stuck together which made it difficult to eat. Not sure if the sauce was just super thick or the noodles were over cooked. Either way I'd still eat there again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience never order delivery from this restaurant. The gentleman who answered the phone was rude didn't seem like he wanted to be there. Messed up me and my boyfriends order. Then when I called to get my salad, because I am vegetarian (and my boyfriend is not) he was completely upset and unprofessional. If this is how you treat your customers and not providing excellent customer service this is not a business I will support."}
{"text":"Good, solid food.  Their pizza is really tasty, and I have a strong love for a good wing...they have.  Their slice/salad/soda combo is a smoking deal.  Who doesn't love good food at a good bargain.  Service has always been courteous and consistent.  Locally owned!!!!!  And...they are right across the street from my mechanic.  So I can get good food while I wait.  BONUS!"}
{"text":"Ordered their Vegan Delight Pizza online for home delivery. Sean delivered my order on time, he was courteous and had excellent customer service skills. The pizza was unbelievably delicious. They even threw in free breadsticks! I love Pizza Heaven Bistro, and will order from them again very soon!"}
{"text":"Great winds, pizza, and beer. This place does not get the credit if deserves, hey sell pizza by the slice and is centralized."}
{"text":"Regular pizza (pep and cheese) is good. However service - not so much.  I decided to try their Pizza Bianca, which I've had at other places before, and they put a crazy amount of ricotta cheese - it just wasn't right with my taste buds. So I asked to exchange, the owner came out, said the pizza was perfectly fine and it's just me, replaces the whole pizza with a single slice of pep and cheese, AND makes me pay for the slice as well as the pizza I didn't eat.  :( first time I ever had that happen. Normally establishments replace the same quantity and don't make you pay for it."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza..that's actually good?! I am shocked and very pleased! I love pizza and I am vegetarian so I do eat cheese, but I try not to eat too much dairy. I've been searching for a place that makes dairy free pizza that's actually good, and I'm glad I could have it here! I went with my sister who is lactose intolerant and my mom who has celiacs and can't have gluten. We were all so excited to try this place after hearing how good it was, and weren't let down! We got zucchini fries and vegan breadsticks for my sister and I, my mom and sister got a gluten free pizza with vegan cheese and basil, and I got a vegan calzone with tomatoes. My mom really enjoyed the pizza! My sister wasn't crazy about the cheese on the pizza but loved the appetizers. My calzone was the size of a football I couldn't even come close to finishing it and I usually have a pretty big appetite!! And it's only $11 for that massive calzone. I couldn't even tell it was vegan either (until later when I ate it cold and the vegan cheese kinda cools differently). But so good! And the server there was awesome, double checking about everything to make sure our food fit our dietary restrictions. Definitely recommend to vegans in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I love their vegetarian sausage, it tastes exactly like real sausage. Their pizza is delicious and the crust is perfect.  I always order breadsticks with my meal, they're really good and at a great price.  They use disinfectant when cleaning tables which you rarely ever see at other places. The wait staff is always excellent, always attentive and super friendly. I found Pizza Heaven on Amazon Local and it was an amazing find. I've been here at least ten times."}
{"text":"Sometimes places redeem themselves....  Here is a note I received the other day.   \"Thanks to you...  FYI  Pizza Heaven changed this promptly and do not charge for cups and take cc for anything now.\"   Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"This is our third time here in a month so I think it's time to share how much we love this hidden gem! The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. Their portions are huge, so make sure you come hungry. Not to mention prices are extremely reasonable. We love the atmosphere as well. There really isn't anything to complain about with this place!"}
{"text":"One of the most diverse vegan menus in the area. Absolutely love that they have a vegan section with much to chose from. It's a small family type feel place. Make sure to have some time when you stop in. Every time I have been there the food has been really good but the service can take a while. Food is definitely worth the wait unless you are super impatient and in a hurry."}
{"text":"I like the dimly lit bistro atmosphere of the place, the prices are fair, and the Agave BBQ pizza was pretty good. I see they even do a pretty generous $5 two slices of cheese pizza and a drink special, that intend to do sometime in the not so distant future. My only complaint, and it's worth mentioning, is the wait time. 35 minutes seemed a little long.  I'll go back for sure. Hopefully that wait isn't an everytime deal."}
{"text":"Best vegan pizza ever. The vegan calzone is phenomenal also. Non-Vegan friends love it too."}
{"text":"Once again, extremely delicious with impeccable service. I've been here a couple of times and have always enjoyed the food, service and ombiance. The pastas are excellent. Try the Tequila with lime sauce or Chipotle sauce both with chicken. Treat your taste buds to excitement."}
{"text":"My husband showed up at the exact time they said our food would be ready for pick up. When he gave them his name they said it wasn't ready. He waited 15-20 min and asked again, the woman then came out immediately with our order which was at that point cold and had obviously been sitting there. On top of it, the food didn't even taste good. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"Here with one of my best friend Wade, and we decided to try a new spot.... so amazing. Food and service is on point. Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven Bistro is amazing! I only started patronizing them after I changed to a plant based lifestyle; and I am so happy that I did. A nice surprises is their separate vegan menu featuring apps, entrees and dessert, my go to is always the Baked Ziti that comes with a delicious piece of foccacia bread and the Vegan Sausage Parmigiano on a toasty Italian hoagie loaf I always get the fries as my side the other option is to have a salad. The food is good dining in or as take away, even as leftovers. They use Follow Your Heart Mozz and it's a perfect companion to all of the vegan dishes. Do yourself a favor if you see a Groupon deal for Pizza Heaven Bistro get it! This place can handle all dietary needs."}
{"text":"Very fast service.  Our salad was brought out to us almost instantly after placing our order and the pizza followed shortly after.  We had one of there vegan pizzas and it was pretty good.  Our three year old is a pretty picky eater but she liked the cheese pizza.  For the price point, service and quality of food I give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Good place to grab lunch when I want a slice of pizza, salad and a beer. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! I ordered the vegan super veggie delight with soy sausage and it was incredible! I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I typically eat Pizza Heaven via delivery, and it shows up to my house in about 20 minutes, which is ridiculously fast. Their pizza is amazing. Their salads are also amazing. Their wings are, you guessed it, amazing! They have several Vegan dishes, and they're very delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and a staff that was polite and on top of it!  Had some version of an everything pizza which was great.  Draft beers were cold.  What's keeping this from 5 stars?  Their drinking water - well take your own..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to a hotel nearby. Estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes, and I got a phone call from the delivery guy outside at 45 minutes on the dot. Great timing! Pizza was good, meatballs were GREAT.  We noted in the special instructions \"send forks and love\". After handing over the goods, the delivery guy then said \"uh.. they told me to give you this\" and produced a drawing of a heart. Made us laugh, and bumped up the experience to a perfect 5 stars. Thanks Pizza Heaven!"}
{"text":"I have to say, it's nice to see a whole vegan menu section at a restaurant. Totally suitable for meat/dairy eaters as well. I had the vegan \"meatball\" parmigiana sandwich and it was delicious. My total after the sandwich and side (spring mix) salad was less than $11 (I only had a water though)."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this local pizza restaurant for dinner and ordered a sausage pizza on whole wheat. It was the most tasteless thing I've ever eaten. Too bad, I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our stay in Phoenix. I very rarely have pizza...basically like never. This is because of my preference for plant based foods and not many places create a suitable pizza, and those that do use Daiya, which I find disgusting! Well, Pizza Heaven uses Vegan Gourmet. On pizza I don't even know if omnivores could tell the difference!  My son ordered a pepperoni pizza off of the \"regular\" menu said it was good too. Our 2nd time there we shared a vegan pineapple pizza (light on the \"cheese\") and we both enjoyed it, just wish there was even more pineapple on it.  Pizza Heaven has a separate Vegan menu offering which earns tons of bonus points in my book!  The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is clean!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Always great service & great food. Their vegan options are always satisfying and it's just pretty awesome they have one. MUST TRY: The veggie balls!"}
{"text":"Just thought I'd leave a quick review for PH. I ordered food online on Easter and the order went through as normal, however PH was actually closed. I knew I would be taking a chance and that they might really indeed be closed, but I decided to try my luck and drive to pick up my order. Yes they were closed.  I just received a call from the manager the following day,apologizing for the confusion and explaining what happened. I just thought that was really nice and a great indicator for great customer service."}
{"text":"This is place is the bomb....eat here 3x and everything we ordered was delicious. Prices are very reasonable and they give a lot of food!!"}
{"text":"I read great things about this place and their vegan options so I was excited to give this place a try. But I wasn't impressed. The service wasn't that great (slow, uneven and he didn't even bother to open my beer for me). I arrived with 3 other people and we all received our food at different times. And about the food: I can't speak for the entire menu as I've only been there once but the vegan sandwich I ordered was just ok and the fries were terrible (frozen, cheap???). The owner did come over and speak with us and she was very nice and the entertainment was good but I was disappointed when I left as I read such good things about this place. May give them another try though...."}
{"text":"We are visiting here from out of town so we were looking for a place to deliver to us and I came across here....  The sausage lasagna is TERRIFIC! Huge portion, extra cheesy, and plenty of sauce (I hate when places skimp on sauce leaving food dry) ordered a Caesar salad and angel bites also and they were pretty good but the lasagna definitely is the star coming from here!   Their delivery was pretty quick to!"}
{"text":"Vegan!!!! Sooo excited to have AMAZING tasting Vegan options at a \"normal\" restaurant! The calzone (stuffed with veggies and sausage by request), Agave BBQ pizza (with added mushrooms and pepperoncini) and the Baked Ziti (favorite) were ALL hits!! Add the authentic ambiance, music, comforting roar of the restaurant and the absolute best service we've ever had and it was another great night here. Farshad (Sean to those of us phonetically challenged) has served us both times and enough can't be said for his genuine kindness and attention to detail no matter how busy it gets. He also runs the register so it's really impressive!  Come here. Good food, good people."}
{"text":"Just stopped by again to try the lasagna and was waited on by a young man named Alex who I now know to be the owner son, and I was treated as if I was at the Ritz-Carlton and enjoyed my delicious lasagna very much. This has quickly become one of my favorite places as their Pizza is outstanding and the prices are extremely reasonable. The menu has just enough variety to make anybody happy and if you want good pizza stop throwing your money away elsewhere and just come here."}
{"text":"Good spot for cheap pizza and wings. Their lunch specials are the jam. Truly a pizza heaven. ;P"}
{"text":"Great vegan options! The baked ziti with soy sausage was delicious. The focaccia with marinara sauce was scrumptious. The Mediterranean pizza was yummy too. They use Follow Your Heart cheese which makes all of the difference. This will be our new go to Italian place since we have a vegan, vegetarian and carnivore, all of whom have many delicious options.  The service was not quite up to par though. The server couldn't answer fairly simple questions about the menu and we waited a long time to order, then for the food to arrive and then for the check. It was frustrating but the food was so yummy it made the poor service easier to cope with."}
{"text":"The Miko Miko and supreme are good.  ok overall. :-/ Did not like there chipotle sauce.  Not spicy at all, and it tasted watered down."}
{"text":"What a find!  Came in for the first time tonight.  EVERYTHING is freshly made with freshly harvested organic ingredients.  Also has a very diverse menu that includes many vegan options. This not just another just pizza place by any means.  Our table had pizza, pasta, and a vegan appetizer that were all outstanding.   This is a well established family run place that takes a lot of pride in what they do.  Prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"You won't go wrong with Pizza Heaven Bistro! This is Daniel and my favorite pizza restaurant! Patricia the owner is personal and connects on our visits... staff is always great... the food is quality and utmost flavor! You won't go wrong here... we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place so thought we would try it out...got the medium buffalo wings and they were perfect..big wings with just the right amount of sauce and kick.   We ended up getting the Mediterranean pizza on the thick whole wheat crust with chicken added..was really good and huge.   Great atmosphere and very clean, nice waitstaff .. Another good pizza joint in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nice customer service, good wings, good pizza, good atmosphere, and clean environment.   Great to have some leftovers to take home and eat later! Who doesn't love cold pizza!  I will be back to try the their other options.   Always great to have great family owned businesses around."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Vegan dishes and live music on weekends. The staff and owner are always friendly. We love this place."}
{"text":"I kinda don't want to review this place so that we can keep it as nice as it was on Friday. My husband and I got a night to ourselves so we tried this place out. It was delicious. But other than that, the service was wonderful, the live music was so cool, and the crowd was chill. Strange that everyone else in the restaurant opted to sit far from the music. We chose to be right by the band and it was the best decision ever. This place is great, it will definitely become a regular for us. We can't wait to take the kids!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work function, and this place is amazing. The salads and pizzas are spot on, and the waiter was amazing, yet unimposing. We were able to have excellent conversations without being interrupted every few seconds. And our glasses were never empty.  It had a warm, cozy, and clean atmosphere, a little dark, but that just gave it a Bostonian feel. I definitely enjoyed this and recommend you go here for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Servings are huge make sure you go hungry. The baked Ziti is so yummy. The cheese bread was okay but not the best. The meatball sandwich is also tastey and comes with French fries."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is definitely not what I expected but in the most wonderful of ways! The portions were huge and the food was absolutely fabulous. I had the chicken parm and my husband had the beef lasagna. Both were freshly made and sooo good. The focaccia bread that comes with it will make anyone a little piggy. Plus BONUS there was live music!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Pizza Heaven for a while now and it was a huge let down!  Food was decent but not great. I didn't even get everything I ordered. When I asked our server about it, his response was \"I'll take what you didn't get off the check.\"  Ya think?    Service was horrible. I had to help myself to their back area for a to-go box and then had to ask for the check at the register up front because our server disappeared. The place was empty!  Here is a tip server, when you don't have anyone eating in your restaurant, you should go above and beyond taking care of customers who are.    I won't be back! Too many other fantastic independent restaurants in this city to waste my time at Pizza Heaven again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaraunts. My mom is gluten free and my sister is vegan. It is so hard to find good, affordable food that meets all our needs and isn't just salad. My only complaint is they took the ravioli off the menu, which was my favorite dish. Also, the fettucini alfredo I had instead was pretty bland."}
{"text":"Ok...this place I really really liked. My friends had the jalapeno poppers and Hawaiian pizza and I had the spaghetti with meatballs. Portions are hearty. Was it the BEST pizza and spaghetti, no but it was pretty good. Our server was super sweet and the guy bussing tables was friendly as well. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE cheesy sausagey carb-laden food.  I also happen to be a vegan. so, Pizza Heaven was in fact HEAVEN for me.  so many vegan options, all clearly marked on the menu.  I had the sausage parm sandwich.  PERFECTION. I started with a salad- salads are not why you eat at Pizza Heaven, but I needed to justify my redic sammie by having something healthy.  the kids had \"traditional\" (ie. with cow's milk cheese) pizza & were plenty happy.  wait staff are friendly & very vegan savvy.  decor is really 1990s' Italian, love it."}
{"text":"I tried this place one time because it's really close to my boyfriend's work and we both agree they'll be seeing a lot of us! Great insalata Caprese, awesome baked ziti and margherita pizza. They took my Entertainment coupon without hassle which was nice.  only complaint is the chunks of garlic on my Margherita pizza. In my opinion there were too many, or not cut finely enough, because I could actually chew little chunks of garlic which was unpleasant to taste. Won't stop me from coming back though, maybe it was a fluke."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan pizza I have ever had. As a vegan for over 10 years I cannot recommend Pizza Heaven Bistro enough. I tried the vegan agave BBQ pizza along with the vegan soysausage sub. Both were unreal out of this world amazing. The service was also incredible. I was immediately greeted by my server Sean. He assisted with drink recommendations as well as answered any questions I had about the pizza. He made sure to keep our water full as well as ensuring we had everything we needed. Seriously, go try this place now."}
{"text":"Been here far more than the 7 check-ins and am surprised to find I've not made note of how good and how affordable this place is on a consistent basis.  Love the lasagna, whether Bolognese or spinach, chicken or beef (I'm not much on sausage with flavored with anisette  - always hated licorice!), and can speak just as positively of the baked ziti with ricotta and marinara, perfectly spiced Cajun chicken Alfredo, and fettuccine  Alfredo with a perfect, not excessively rich creamy sauce, all currently $8-$9.  I've never even tried the pizzas but my friends have and seem to enjoy them all - and I can attest they look and smell great - and as I'm so hungry right now it's going to be tough to not re-route my trip home for one of those tonight.   Sub sandwiches at $7 or $8 also a pleasure. The ones I've tried include the Meatball Parmigiano, the Heaven's Ham, and I think the Italian Stuffer, well-filled with salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  A bonus for the gluten impaired, brown rice pasta available as a substitute on most pasta dishes, at no discernible loss of taste or texture.   Service is always friendly if not exactly spot-on.  The young wait staff may not ask if you want wine, dessert, or a refill on your tea or soft drink, but it otherwise so affable and everything so affordable, you can overlook it - and just look forward to that cheesecake or tiramisu on a return visit.   Very good food. Very affordable priced."}
{"text":"My spouse and I enjoy the chill atmosphere, and delicious pizza! This is our favorite date night spot.  I love the great vegetarian/vegan options at Pizza Heaven.  The food is delicious, and the service is always consistently great!  Try the Veggie balls with hot wing sauce or the Vegan Delight pizza.  These are two of my favorites"}
{"text":"Everything from our server, Angelica to the owner, Patricia, as well as, the food (I had the 10\" gluten free, homemade italian sausage pizza) was perfect! I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a great place. Vegans and vegetarians will love this place. We had the Agave BBQ pizza with the soy sausage and mozzarella (we are vegetarians but they also have great vegan cheese). We talked to the owner and she makes a lot of the ingredients from scratch. Come on down, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, a this joint has a separate vegan section on their menu. Service is prompt, attentive and the food is amazing. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"After ordering delivery from here over a dozen times, I finally visited in person! Very busy on the Friday night we went, so we sat at the bar. Cozy & romantic inside, low light, live music. Good wine selection and the VEGAN pizza is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great prices! David went above and beyond. He was running the entire place taking care of it all, and did it all with a smile!"}
{"text":"I have only picked up a to-go order once from Pizza Heaven ( I am anxious to return again).  We purchased two lasagna orders for carry-out.  They were delicious and I am picky about lasagna.   They stayed nice an hot til I got home and plated them.  I plan on going back as soon as I can and order the lasagna again and hopefully dine in next time."}
{"text":"My neighbor brought one home for us to celebrate my belated birthday - Queen Margherita pizza was very good;  a basic pie with quality ingredients that shine through.  Well done."}
{"text":"In my quest to try all the restaurants on 7th Street near my house, I decided to check out Pizza Heaven. Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.  You can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you're in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.  I first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I'm trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I've specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn't one item that they delivered that didn't look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding \"Suicide\" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.  I had actually eaten Pizza Heaven's dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  \"Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley\". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award and although I haven't tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.  For those of you who don't want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won't have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion, and I'm sure will require a larger tip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time last night and enjoyed two great drinks and pizzas. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have an extremely allergy-friendly menu and our server (Caroline) was super patient in explaining all the ingredients. There were a few things I wasn't sure about because of my long list of allergies and she happily brought out the book from the back with the full list so I could check. Also, we found it quite impressive that she was handling the register, running food, making drinks at the bar, and serving tables... wow!  There was a little miscommunication about my order, but Caroline was quick to make it right. We're excited to come back again, this is probably the best gluten-free vegan pizza I've had in the valley!"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven brings so much joy to the Phoenix vegan community. The owner has created a vegan menu that complements the normal omni menu. It's not an after-thought, it's an informed, exciting menu for those who grew up eating Italian classics.   To start - the veggie balls are incredible! They are crispy and filled with mixed veggies. I love the \"crunch\" I get when I bite into one. I'm torn between the marinara and Buffalo sauces. Both are so good! While I've tried the vegan pizzas, sausage parm sandwich, calzone and ravioli before, the vegan baked ziti is hands down one of the best vegan pasta dishes I've ever had. A good baked ziti is a work of art. Theirs is a Da Vinci. I think they make the sausage in house. The cheese is Follow Your Heart, which melts well and doesn't have too much flavor. They somehow managed to get the right crispness to flavorful grease ratio - just like classic baked ziti. The bread they serve with it just acts as a sponge to scoop up the remaining sauce/sausage combo at the end of the meal. Oh, and it's HUGE. It's usually at least three meals for us.   The service at Pizza Heaven is usually great - no long waits for food and prompt service overall. If you order to go, they will have you phone number in their system after the first order, for ease of ordering.  We haven't tried their vegan desserts yet - we never have room. Maybe on our next trip, we'll bring some home!"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven is  amazing! their vegan menu is incredible, the owner is incredibly kind and the atmosphere is fun! give this place a try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"The online ordering process super easy. They delivered my pizza n bonus breadsticks super fast. I ordered a pepperoni n Italian sausage pizza, simply delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Pizza Heaven tonight for the first time since it got pretty decent reviews. When we arrived we were seated at a table that had dirty napkins and drinks still on it. The guy moved them and sat us without cleaning the table. Then he disappeared for a while. During this time I asked another sever to clean our table. She sprayed the table and got the cleaner all over my pants and continued to spray near our drinks. Then we waited and waited. We had two little kids with us who were getting hungry and after 20 minutes of waiting for him to come back to even take our order, we decided to leave. Horrible first impression. Horrible service. Horrible hygiene. We won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for vegan food. I've tried all the vegan appetizers and entrees and love it all. My absolute fav is the calzone, pizza with veggies and v-sausage, the v-ravioli, and the v-sausage parmigiana sandwich. They season the sausage their own way and when I first ate here I had to ask and make sure I got the right order cuz it tasted like the real thing. Thank you, Pizza Heaven for creating a vegan menu."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Best pizza in Arizona! Can't recommend enough! Will add rest of review later."}
{"text":"love this place. top notch. food is delicious, and they deliver! and they have vegan options! and their staff is so kind and sweet! need I say more?"}
{"text":"Pizza was good.   Service was great. We had a hand tossed cheese and pepperoni.  I see lots of people getting salads, pastas and sandwiches.  Looking forward to trying some more menu items."}
{"text":"Searching for a lunch spot in a new city is always difficult. What yelpers in Los Angeles might rate 4 stars could be totally different from the 4 stars a place might get from locals in Phoenix and I learned that all too well during my 5 week stay in AZ.   But Pizza Heaven Bistro? It went above my expectations. At hearty servings of pasta complete with chicken and bread priced at $10, i was surprised at how good it actually was. Because sometimes quantity does not equal quality.  Must Try: Cajun alfredo with chicken pasta, Chipotle cream with chicken pasta  Although I'll probably never return to the oven that is Phoenix, if I ever did Pizza Heaven Bistro would be a place I'd come back to."}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven is our most absolute favorite place in Phoenix to get salad, pizza and pasta. Why? Because we are VEGAN. We don't eat animals. We LOVE restaurants that not only serve, but actually make plant based options from scratch- just like Pizza Heaven! Their homemade veggie balls are to DIE for! We dream of the mouth watering Vegan baked ziti and they have vegan cheese and make the most amazing pizza! We also love the friendly service and Lorenzo is our favorite server- he always greets us with a smile and calls me sweetie- always a nice touch for a 40 year old woman! Thanks Pizza Heaven and staff for giving us a reliable place to always fill our hungry Vegan tummies!"}
{"text":"Great for delivery! And being able to order through Yelp makes PH an easy choice for the nights I don't want to cook at home. Have had the Works Pizza, lasagna, meatball sandwich, and jalapeño poppers - all of which are stellar. Reasonable prices for non-chain pizza, Italian dishes, and quick delivery. Pizza Heaven is a weekend staple at my house!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I cannot figure out for the life of me why they have so many good reviews.  Seriously, where is everyone eating at that they think this place is so great? My only thought is that all of the good reviews is due to the fact they have so many gluten free and vegan options, which I assume is hard to find at restaurants.    Went in tonight for dinner around 5:30pm and although there were only 4 tables filled, it took 10 mins to get seated - including 3 employees all passing by saying they would be back to help us.  Our waiter had no personality and was invisible most of the time.  We ordered mozzarella sticks to start but never got them  (I know he heard because he asked if we wanted 6 or 10).  He finally came back at the end asking how my drink was... I just wanted our check and pizza packed up so I didn't tell him how awful it was - hence the reason it was barely drank.    We got two of the smallest sized pizzas to share - Bianca was decent but tastes exactly like every other pizza places version of it.  Thin crust pepperoni was very blah.  We have at least a full pizza worth that will probably end up going to my dog or the trash in a few days.  No interest at all in eating it - not worth the calories.    I'm quite annoyed that I wasted $50 for dinner tonight.  My daughter and I always try to go to local places and want to try new places when possible.  Bad customer service + bad food = FAIL!"}
{"text":"Two hand tossed pizza crusts; one vegan, one regular. Both fantastic. What an amazing vegan selection. My dairy intolerant son was in \"heaven\".  Vegan meatballs were also a big hit."}
{"text":"Pizza is like sex.  Even bad pizza isn't half bad.  Well my first girlfriend and this place have proven that old age adage NOT to be true.  Zero, and I mean ZERO flavor in this pizza.  I'm all about the sauce and this sauce has the distinct flavor of water.  And where in the heck do you find flavorless Pepperoni?  Where ever you do, that's where these guys shop!  Yikes!"}
{"text":"I have known about this place for quite some time, as they're practically famous due to the fact that they have an entirely separate vegan menu. The relaxed an unpretentious atomosphere is refreshing, as most restaurants in down town Phoenix you can easily feel out of place if you walk in with jeans and a tee-shirt (in my personal opinion). I am a self proclaimed crust snob, but pizza was absolutely phenomenal...we had the Mediterranean. We also could not pass up the opportunity to try their vegan cheesecake. Made with a cashew base.. it's decadent, yet balanced, and a hint of cinnamon. Divine!!! All the while we were kept entertained by the wonderful tunes of KSM, Michael Jackson, Journey and many other classics. While all of this was wonderful in its own rite, what took the experience above and beyond was when the owner, Patricia, came over to our table and struck up conversation. What started as a simple \"how did you like the vegan cheesecake? I bake it myself!\" Led into an amazing talk about her passion for the restaurant, the food, and her community. 35+ years open, she's obviously doing something right! If only I lived closer, I would probably never leave (on second thought, it's probably better that I don't!!). This place is a gem and 100,000% worth stopping by, even if it's out of your way."}
{"text":"We've had almost half of their vegan options and are in love with this place. They've only accidentally given us real cheese on a pizza once (out of the hundreds of times we've ordered food here), but as always check your order before you leave with takeout! In addition to pizza they have huge hot sandwiches. These vegan options are not healthy, but they are amazingly good. And this is a great place for mixed families/groups to go because they've got vegan and non-vegan options and everybody's happy.  Our favs: Salad - so we start off feeling healthy, and have extra vegan ranch.   Veggieballs - vegan \"meat ball\" appetizer - fried veggie balls with Buffalo wing sauce (we prefer over red sauce) and vegan ranch dressing. Not what we expected - they're not fake meat. They're almost like Pakora's with little chunks of veggies in them.   Vegan Vegetarian pizza - check out the different crust options. We prefer the regular crust and if we have extra vegan ranch, that crust gets dipped in it.  Vegan Delight - this cheesy, sausage and veggie pizza has great flavor. The sausage texture and spices are very realistic - I'm not advocating for tricking any meat eaters, but they would probably enjoy this and not know the difference.  Vegan Sausage Parmigiano - huge hot sandwich with vegan Italian sausage, vegan cheese, and veggies. Half of one of these can be a meal, but you will eat the whole thing without regret.  Angel Bites - this is basically a huge pile of donut holes with powered sugar and chocolate syrup. And like donuts, they aren't as good as left overs, but you will not have room to eat them all by yourself so get them to share with about 6 other people. There's also cheesecake, and it might actually be the healthiest thing on the menu other than salad.  They can also make vegan breadsticks by request."}
{"text":"Thank you for taking care of us vegans! The pizza is excellent and I enjoy the staff.   One small dislike- you vegan ranch costs way too much for a side. Something to revisit maybe."}
{"text":"Just had carry out from these guys but DANG! If I had to rate Pizza in Phoenix, I would go 1. Pizza Bianca 2. Pizza Heaven. Yes, its that good in my opinion."}
{"text":"I got the sausage lasagna, and I loved every minute of it. The 4 dollar mimosa's were. Pretty good deal too!"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven has been around for  years - it's a part of the Central Phoenix history and there is a reason for that - I can sum it up in three words...Yum....Yum...and YUM!  The pizza is amazing...the prices are great and the employees are awesome.    Pizza Heaven offers wheat crusts on request and has a really substantial list of vegetarian options.  The sandwiches are tasty and the pasta selections are generous and definitely hit the spot.  The staff is great - The owner is very consistent when it comes to making her way to each table to welcome the guests and ensure everything is satisfying.  I would be remised if I didn't mention the waiter Juan who has been there for a number of years...I don't think anything compares to his cuteness -and to top it off, he's attentive, and kind.  Last night we dined in and ordered a large 3-toping pizza, two salads, two cokes and a beer and when we left we were more than satisfied with the food and extremely satisfied with the bill as there are very few places left that you can get a solid dinner and enjoyable atmosphere for under 30.00!  So can I just say, when your looking for some good eats and you're in the Central Phoenix area...you should definitely check this place out.    Word?  Word!"}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza was horrible. Waitress had a big nose ring through her septum...turned my stomach. Can't eat and look at that. She checked our table once. Horrible service. She was friendly, of course."}
{"text":"Overall less than expected experience for our first time here.  To keep things simple I have listed some information below:  Pros -   1) nice staff that was friendly and consistently apologized for the negatives that will be described below 2) food was hot and seemed fresh and in general was okay in my opinion 3) prices seemed reasonable and in line with the area  Negatives -   1) very long wait for our food 2)  we ordered two children's spaghetti and meatball dishes and requested that this come out as soon as possible and they ended up coming out within minutes of our pizza, which I would expect could have been prepared faster than a pizza 3) we ordered some chicken wings that were completely forgotten  In summary, the less than expected experience for a locally owned business was disappointing but hopefully it was an outlier night for them (although I won't know as I don't plan to return)"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant.  The pizza crust is delicious--crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  Huge points for having a vegan menu (vegan items are made with Follow Your Heart dairy-free cheese).  Service has been friendly and fairly attentive."}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving for wings and was not disappointed! Great customer service and wings. I like the honey bbq(I can't remember the exact name). There's also a hot version of it for those who are daring. The wings are big and meaty which was great! The only thing I didn't like was you can't do half and half on an order because the server said the owner doesn't like doing that. However, since it was my first time, I didn't mind paying an extra $1 to get 2 separate orders so I can try the different flavors. I also got fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was deliciously fresh. Be careful to not burn your tongue because everything will be hot and freshly made. I will definitely come back to try the pizzas when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My last review was hard to swallow, it wasn't something that I particularly liked doing. Having said that, I am proud to say I can't possibly give Pizza Heaven anything less then 5 stars now. This is why:  Two days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).  I am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.  I am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I came here twice in two days after driving past it for months on end. Sometimes you just need Italian, I guess.   The first time was near the end of the night on a Thursday. I ordered the sausage parm sandwich. I expected a whole sausage on a bun, with cheese and sauce. Instead, I got a bit of sliced up sausage with cheese and lots of sauce on a giant bun. I ripped open the bun, laid the two sides flat, and evened out the insides on it. I basically had french bread pizzas. Not exactly what I'd wanted, but it was fine.   The next day, my coworkers decided to go to lunch here, so I thought I'd give the slices a try. Those were solid. Two slices of pepperoni pizza, which filled me up and were on special. Good deal.   Both times, the servers weren't very attentive. At the lunch, I waited 20 minutes for the server to walk by before I finally got up and handed him my card. He seemed overwhelmed, but there were only two other tables with people in there.   I'm down to come back regardless. I like pizza and their wing prices don't look so bad either."}
{"text":"Sorry I can't help you as far as gluten free goes, but I had the regular pizza, cheese sticks, and wings! Sooooooo good and because the wings are baked they aren't all greasy or dry. They are great and taste way better. Yes a little pricier than the pizza chains, but aren't you sick of those by now? Just try it I really feel like it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great little place & prices for everything. The pizza is pretty pricey though but it taste like quality so can't complain.   Appetizers were great & have lunch specials that are very reasonable. Like the environment inside very clean & great service"}
{"text":"So  I really wanted to like this place in spite of the reviews about the slow service and staff getting overwhelmed.  Unfortunately all of it was true. Our server started out really strong but disappeared for long periods of time after our wings were delivered cold. We ordered a pizza and while we were still waiting she came back to our table and asked if we were ready for our check?? We explained that we hadn't gotten our pizza yet. When it arrived it was lukewarm and very dry. It took forever to receive and pay our check and it seemed all of the servers were clustered around the cashier area in mass confusion.  Our water was never refilled and I had to go up and ask for refills for beer and wine. Overall a real disappointment. We have no reason to be back as there are tons of great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Cute spot we found on yelp. Wings were great and crispy and spicy. Pizza was delicious not too thick."}
{"text":"First time tonight! We LOVED it! Delicious vegan balls,  vegan ziti,  pepperoni pizza,  wings, and cheesecake! The service was excellent! Very attentive wait staff.  The owner is friendly and outgoing and this restaurant is clearly her passion. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I read mixed reviews on this place and thought I check them out. Well, let's start off positive and say the place is cozy with a decent dining room seating. Their substitute for Meatballs is creative yet I find the Veggieballs to be better non fried and the buffalo sauce could use a lot less salt. The Pizza starts at $12 and looks delicious yet lack flavor.  The Tequila Lime Chicken was not very good, rather disappointing. A lot of pasta and the chicken was over cooked and hard.  Perhaps this was a dish they whipped up close to closing time yet, come on... really?"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. The crust was fluffy and perfectly baked. The service was a bit slow.  They had nice outdoor seating. We also had garden salads, that was fresh."}
{"text":"Based on the three things I tasted this place was amazing, I am not vegan but the vegan vegetarian pizza is one of the best pizza I've had. I also tried angel but dessert which is vegan too was delicious. I started it all off with their margarita which was good average nothing special but maybe they should try something like mango or watermelon margarita because someone knew what they were doing ! If you have a vegan friend this is the place to go with them ! So good I'll be back soon !"}
{"text":"Haven't been in 2 years, went a gain tonight as a group of 7. Sat on th epatio. We had a great night, food was good. Service great. Love the sloppy wings and pizza was ok. Mozz sticks, still my favorite!"}
{"text":"Fresh made pasta , family owned !! Always fast delivery!!! I love everything on the menu!!! Even the veggie options"}
{"text":"Solid, regular crust pizza. The price is right and the sauce is decent. This is my go-to for a neighborhood pizza joint that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to find a good italian place around town and decided it was time to drop into Pizza Heaven. We started with 10 bone-in wings in the agave bbq sauce. The wings were sauced nicely and my husband ordered the milder version, I think the hot agave would have had just the right flavor. The wings were the perfect crisp and very tasty overall. I ordered the spinach and chicken alfredo which was served with two huge pieces of foccacia. OMG! I am super picky, especially when it comes to cream sauces but this was one of the best alfredo sauces I have ever had. It had a ton of white meat chicken and fresh spinach. It was surprisingly light for being a cream based sauce and I couldn't get enough. My husband built his own pizza with hand tossed crust, the marinara sauce, pepperoni and sausage throughout and jalapenos on half. The crust was perfect and the toppings very flavorful. Our service experience was a bit strange but we had some recommendations and the food will bring us back for more. They offered a few drink specials and looked to offer pizza by the slice and other lunch specials during the day. I just found my new go-to italian place in Central Phoenix. Yum!"}
{"text":"We had this for lunch today.  I had split a Spinach salad with 5 medium wings. I'm a wing person and love good wings; however these were far from great.  They were tiny wings and the sauce was just too watery and not great.  The salad had wilted spinach.  I picked pieces to eat, but threw much of it away.  I wont be back.    I gave it two stars because a co-worker liked her sandwich."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I must say the Pizza & Hot wings were amazing. It's fresh and full of flavor. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Pizza Bianca with ricotta is worth 5 stars all by itself. I read some bad reviews by other Yelpers about this restaurant and I guess you must have gotten the wrong thing on the wrong day. I love this place."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here I had a bad experience.  Patti the owner took the time to message me and apologize. She offered me a free pizza as well. The pizza was delicious and Patti was very friendly when I came in. It's nice to see a business where the owner really cares about their customers."}
{"text":"Came back to give this place a second try and I am glad we did. Pizza was tasty and service was much better then the first time and they were busier! Recently moving to central Phoenix we like to try new places but we will defiantly come again. First time I wasn't so sure"}
{"text":"Great prices for the the quality of pizza.  We got wings and the pizza. It was all good. No complaints.  Quick, friendly service. So good.  Everything was good. Like, so good. It's my new fav pizza place thing.  So good. Like, good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat pizza if you are vegan!!  They offer vegan cheese (follow your heart) and vegan sausage (gardein).  Our server was very friendly and told us what products they used.  The pizza was amazing and delicious!  It's awesome that Phoenix has a place were vegetarians and vegans can go and get meat substitutes on a pie!"}
{"text":"This place is great for vegans, omnivores, anyone! Homey, great service, on the weekend the owner comes by and chats with you and offers samples. Almost everything is homemade, no preservatives, great ingredients.  The homemade vegan plain cheesecake was amazing. Wow. Would have that again a million times.  The garlic bread with Follow Your Heart cheese was really, really good.  We forgot to order the Mediterranean Pizza with whole wheat crust, but it was still good.  The veggie balls starter is a potato/veggie fritter and very good.  The prosecco is a good deal.  The salad was very nice and big.  Will absolutely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a business close by and spotted PIZZA so we stopped in. I like the italian bistro decor. Also like the lunch specials they have. Pizza slice was good, side salad was basic (as a side salad usually is) and the wings were good. Our waitress...super friendly"}
{"text":"Where do I start ... first off I am mad at myself of that I didn't find this place sooner, second of all GET HERE! They have an entire vegan menu, staff and as super friendly, outside patio even though it's noisy I love sitting outside.  I hope I get back to AZ again soon because I already want to come here!!!  Prices are reasonable, food is flavorful, staff is nice, bee is cold, and ... well VEGAN menu!"}
{"text":"OMG SO IT WAS HAPPY HOUR and I was meeting a hungry friend at the bar who wanted to EAT PIZZA. I hastily scoured yelp for a decent place to grab a pizza in Central Phoenix, and Pizza Heaven jumped OUT at me!! Better yet, there was a 50% off any Pizza coupon in The Entertainment Book!! WOO! I was greeted by a stylish and friendly staff, pizza was ready within 20 minutes of my phone call, and WOW!! Such a great pie!! Fresh basil in the sauce!! A mix of nice cheeses! Great pepperoni!!! Exquisite crust!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT MOAR."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first visit, but it might be my last. Our server was new, which was the beginning of all of our problems. First off we ordered our appetizers and entrees all at once to make things easier on the new server. Our appetizers came out completely over cooked. Then the entrees came out. One of which was missing and didn't make it to the table for at least 10 minutes. I had to track down oir waitress to get an update on the food and to ask for more water. Finally we received all of our food and asked for the check only to be given another tables check. When I walked to the front desk to get the check it had no discount and there was no apology for the terrible service. It was almost like they hoped that we would just accept crappy service since the server was new. I mentioned the awful service and all that they offered to do was take half off of the entree that took forever to make it to the table. The food and service are normally good, but tonights fiasco has turned me off of this restaurant for a long time if not forever."}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW:  The restaurant was close by to us, so we ordered a pizza and it arrived about 40 minutes later. I love the large amount of toppings and thickness in the crust, the sauce was also awesome. The cheese was not the best I've had, but it worked well. They also gave us free breadsticks along with our order. I have not dined in yet, but their delivery is pretty darn good :)"}
{"text":"Normally do this for beer on Untapped but this pizza is top notch so it called for this photo! Rena is hella friendly and her serving skills was outstanding! The owner Patricia takes time to make sure our food is world-class. Love this place! Try a slice! I'm sure their variety of pizza will have your attention!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just need a pizza, to-go. Make that two pizzas.   We called it in ahead of time, and when we arrived for the pick up, the order was ready to go. Thumbs up for that. I had just enough time to check in on Yelp and take a peek at the inside of the restaurant area and thought I'd like to dine-in the next time I have a pizza craving, which I haven't had for a while and I'm a little late writing this review.  There wasn't anything special about the pizzas, just pizza, but it definitely satisfied my need to indulge and fed four of us at a reasonable price, plus I didn't have to cook!"}
{"text":"First off their wings WOA! They were super tasty! If your love wings I highly suggest ordering them.   We also ordered the \"works\" pizza and a margherita pizza. And the pizzas are ok I've had better.  We also got mozzarella sticks and I wouldn't order them again. The cheese wasn't melted and the marinara sauce was quite bland.   The service is great our waitress was very friendly however, it was EXTREMELY slow. It took forever for our food to arrive. The menu is short and sweet gets to the point my type of menu!   Parking is pretty limited, I don't know how busy they get on weekend but I would assume if they were any busier than the night we had dinner here it would be hard to find parking.   All in all great customer service and awesome wings!"}
{"text":"The location is easy to find, right on 7th Street in Phoenix and has off street parking.    Upon entering we found that there was an area to wait for take out orders and small adjoining dining area that we found dim and cozy.  Pizza Heaven not only has Follow Your Heart soy cheese but also vegan sausage.  In addition, if you're looking for gluten free crust they've got you covered. Personally I've never been a fan of sausage so there was no interest for me to try the vegan sausage, but I did go for my trusty stand by of double pineapple.    The pizza was truly awesome and it was nice to have a bit of a change having the cheese since it had been so long. Note: from what I could see the smallest pizza I could get was a 12 inch, which is a size my husband and I would usually share.  My husband went non-vegan calzone that was HUGE and plenty for 2 meals, but he was pretty darn happy with his choice too."}
{"text":"So happy with this place. They have a great selection of pizza and pastas and it's even great for people who are vegan or gluten free. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Are you watching your weight but miss real food....well then look no further. FOOD- I have had the vegan delight pizza, which is super delicious. I also have had the spaghetti with veggie balls and the vegan ranch. You cannot tell the difference in the vegan ranch vs. real ranch and it is a fraction of the calories. Go to this place and indulge on anything on the vegan menu, which is vast. My cup of wine runneth over for the clandestine food that tricks my belly into believing it is enjoying a fatty treat, which it is not. You can access the vegan menu by going to their Facebook page rather than their website. SERVICE- The owner is kind and helpful and gets really jazzed up about the vegan menu too.  WAIT TIME- About 15 to 20 minutes. They are not miracle workers and it is pizza..."}
{"text":"I didn't die, but I have been to heaven... pizza heaven that is.  The parking on a Friday evening at 7 was hellish.    The decor was nicer than I expected in the dining room, cozy and romantic and there was live music.  The pizza was thick and doughy, more along the lines of a dominos style pizza then a fancy authentic italian pizza."}
{"text":"what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said.  when I go in. It reminds me of the bistro in the lady and the tramp. I FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I will continue to come to this place as long as I live in phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened, but I haven't been to Pizza Heaven in quite some time (2+ years??) until just the other night the vegan Agave Bbbq pizza popped in my head.  I convinced my family to join me, and we each got something different so we could all share. We did the vegan pizza, vegan spaghetti, and a vegan calzone with vegan sausage and sun dried tomatoes.  First off, those 3 dishes produced leftovers of at least half the food. The portions are huge.  Second off, the food was AH-MAY-ZINNNNGGGG. The calzone was especially delicious and I have been thinking about it ever since. Even the spaghetti was fantastic. In fact, I'm eating it cold right now which is my inspiration for writing this review.   My husband opted to not go the vegan route and built his own pizza with double Canadian bacon, mushrooms, and some other items I don't remember, but he was extremely satisfied and had his own set of leftovers he finished today.   I will say that if you are on a diet, this is a terrible option, but if you want an incredibly delicious and hearty meal, do not skip this place; especially if you are vegan!   Ps they cater to all eating types including gluten free and vegetarian as well. They also have vegan cheesecake which I've always been too stuffed to try."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! Great spot to pick up lunch close to downtown. Sometimes they are a little understaffed and don't have enough people attending to customers dining in but there's no complaints about the food!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! We had the Bianca with Italian sausage and it was DELICIOUS!! We had a Groupon and no issues to honor it. Our waitress, Rene, was sweet and soo nice!! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We eat here quite often even though we live in Tempe. The pizza is some of the best in the Phoenix area, and the service is absolutely excellent. One of the servers recognized us from a visit months before and even remembered what we had ordered back then! We highly recommend Pizza Heaven for the great food and especially the service. The only drawback is the tiny parking lot, which is a real challenge if you drive a large vehicle like I do. Otherwise, A+++."}
{"text":"Love that a place like this with specifically vegan calzones and pasta exists! Hidden little gem for plant based diets."}
{"text":"I love that Phoenix is a pizza mecca... people don't realize that our little melting pot is rife with premiere pizza joints. This is one of those places... You could chuck a rock from the front door and break the glass of one or two other pizza places, but you wouldn't be able to find anything else within walking distance worth eating....   The kid behind the counter was really nice and the slice I had was delicious... spicy pepperonis and tasty crust. My only gripe would be that it tasted a bit re-heated, but those of you familiar with pizza by the slice joints will probably enjoy that. I can't expect them to cook an entire fresh pizza for me just to eat one slice... especially in the mid-afternoon.   The place was clean and the bathroom was pretty nice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What an amazing place for vegan options!! Patricia, the owner, was absolutely wonderful and the food was beyond delicious!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here. I came with my family and we ordered wings and the spicy chipotle pizza. The wings were good, but the pizza was amazing!!!! We also ordered a brownie a la mode. It was okay. The brownie wasn't warm and it wasn't too much ice cream. If the brownie was better, I would have gave it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is great! Atmosphere is awesome on Fridays because of live music! Definitely would recommend !"}
{"text":"The name Pizza Heaven Bistro is accurate. I walked in with a groupon skeptical about the service and food (as I always am with a groupon) but to my surprise, the service was excellent and the food was delicious and high quality. Angelica was our server and she was so sweet and helpful! The prices are more than reasonable for the authentic food you get. The atmosphere is very cozy and family like and they also have live music in the evening. I will definitely be returning to this Italian joint! Absolutely LOVE!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place I've ever been to. Great vegan menu! They are super friendly and the prices are fair. I also love how when I call in to place an order, they already know who I am and can pull up all the previous orders I've done with them before. Makes things super easy. Love them!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. I loved how cheap it all was. My bf and I went here for lunch one day and got a medium wheat crust with vegan mozzarella cheese basil and spinach! It was so good! We also got French fries with parmesan cheese. Super filling, I think the total came up to about $20. Decently priced I would say. Very nice friendly staff! I had a great waiter! Was actually dead when we got there though, we were the only ones, which made it kind of fun but I'm sure it gets relatively busy there! I would deff go back for some healthy pizza!"}
{"text":"Great food. Quaint and personable atmosphere. Tequila lime chicken was delicious. Alex was a fantastic server !"}
{"text":"Super busy Fathers Day but waited it out because I love this place and come from Tempe just to munch here. Even tho busy, the owner took some time to chat about her new vegan menu items. One of which is a vegan margarita pizza that was beyond delish! Love, Love, Love this place!"}
{"text":"Healthy pizza...does it exist?  Maybe not, but Pizza Heaven is the closest you'll get to it, thanks to all of their alternative pizza toppings.  You won't find whole wheat crust and soy cheese as an option at many pizza places, but you will here!  And the pizza is pretty cheap too, so you can order without feeling overly guilty about your meal, in dollars or calories!  The restaurant is not very big, and is just filled with tables and chairs.  But don't let the casual atmosphere fool you- the pizza is delicious!  They also have a few TV's if I remember right and of course, a nice selection of alcoholic beverages.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"We placed an order online, which was set to arrive at 7:06pm. When it didn't arrive, we waited ten minutes to give leeway since it was raining. When we called we were put on hold, only to be told at 7:20 that our pizza would be here in 15 minutes, but that they forgot to send part of our order. We were also told that this was the fault of the online system, and that they were really busy. It is 7:30 and I'm typing this still waiting for my pizza. We weren't offered any discount for the prolonged delivery time or  for our order not coming all at once.  7:35 and still no pizza.  7:40 and my pregnant in my third trimester self is starting to feel more monster than human as my hangry-ness elevates to a thus far inexperienced level.  7:45 and I'm regretting already tipping online, only to remember that it's not the delivery person's fault and I need to be nice to them still when (if) they come with our food.  7:50 and I'm thinking maybe this is a conspiracy to make everyone ordering pizza instead fast for the beginning of Lent.  7:55 and I'm starting to have hallucinations that I hear a car pulling up to my house. Every time a neighbor drives by I get a tiny sparkle of hope that quickly turns into a little rage flame. My sweet husband and dog are on our rainy porch looking forlornly out into our street waiting for the food to come.  8:00 Eff it. I have nothing left to say about the store's far too Einstein-ian perspective on time.  8:05 and I'm on hold again to cancel. I was offered $10 off and a free medium pizza next time (why not for this order?) For double the time.  8:12 and as we are pulling out to get food the delivery driver pulls up, I go to tell him we canceled the order, but he told me that the manager called him and told him to give us the food and a refund in cash. Well done on the recovery!  8:15 and I'm enjoying what really is some of the best pizza in Phoenix. Thank you for stepping up in a great way (even at the very end) and to the awesome delivery driver.  Minus one star for DESPERATELY needing to update your online ordering system. But this is about food, and your pizza is the best."}
{"text":"I have only had the pizza delivery from here, but damn, was it good. Not cheap, over $40 to feed four us, but well worth it. It was hot, it tasted fresh, the ingredients were great. We had the chicken alfredo pizza, which I was skeptical of. Alfredo has a tendency to be rich and over used. But it was a perfect balance. Absolutely wonderful. The Queen Margherita pizza was awesome also. Again the ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the cheese was awesome (they use buffalo mozzarella). I say pizza is like sex. And this place is one helluva orgasm."}
{"text":"I personally was not overly excited about the pizza, but my girlfriend and I also split an order of some crazy spicy chicken pasta - it was absolutely awesome.  THAT ITEM was a 5-star meal.  Also, the Tira Misu was straight out of a box, still half frozen.  It was GOOD, but I wouldnt pay $5 for a store-bought Tira Misu slice again..."}
{"text":"LOVE THE VEGAN OPTIONS HERE AND LOVE LORENZO!!! He was super informative and attentive and very kind to us.  Can't wait to try out more - had the veggie balls, bbq vegan pizza and company had beef lasagna"}
{"text":"We went in with a $40 Groupon, and ordered up the Mediterranean mix, as an appetizer, and a Greek Pizza, and a plain cheese calzone, along with a couple of beers.  It was all so good, but impossible to finish, so...  We had delicious leftovers the next day.  I thought the staff was friendly, and even though we were there too early for dinner, everything was great!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS vegan pizza here! They use follow your heart cheese and gardein crumbles. The hand tossed crust is really good. And they have fat tire beer. Our waitress was really nice too! We ordered a handtossed vegan pizza with vegan cheese, vegan sausage, green olives and garlic. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  The first time I drove from Tempe to Phoenix to pick up a Vegan pizza for carry out.   The pizza was delicious and tasted great the next day, absolutely loved it!  My buddy had told me they had awesome sandwiches as well.  So today I decided to bring two friends and make the trip to eat there, it unfortunately was not the same experience..  I ordered the Veggieball's rolled in buffalo sauce as an appetizer, came out quick and tasted very good!   Based off this I decided to get the Veggieball Parmegeano Sub with fries.   When the food comes out she puts it down and I wait for it to cool off only to notice this was the wrong Sandwich, I had gotten the \"veggie baked sub\" by mistake, when I lifted up the sub, the marinara was so watery that it caused the bread to turn to mush and instantly the Sandwich fell apart..  At this point I had to get up to FIND our waitress and let her know I got the wrong order. She offers to get me my correct order witch ended up taking quite a while.  By the time my correct order came both of my friends were done with their food. The sandwich itself was forgettable. Pretty much almost no marinara, and the veggie balls were way over fried and crunchy.   After it was over I had to once again GET UP to find our waitress (twice nand get a box and our check.  And when we get the bill I notice nothing was comped. No discount or appetizer taken off for the inconvenience.. Nothing done to make it right. Full charged for everything.   Moral of the story is from now on I'm going to stick to the pizza, and stick to carry out instead of dining in. Very disappointed that today was the opposite experience that I had from the first time."}
{"text":"OK. I have to say I was a bit skeptical of a restaurant that uses Groupon to get business.  In my experience, that hasn't served me well.  Today it did.   Our server,  River, sat us at a table that we reserved and although we didn't need the reservation,  they saved us the table anyway.  The menu looked great with a wide variety of choices to please me and my picky kids. River suggested the hot agave BBQ wings and everyone loved them. I'm a vegetarian and they made my mouth water. And that says a lot.  But.the.pizza. Oh my. The pizza. I haven't had pizza like that in a long time.  Plentiful toppings. Quality ingredients.  It was cooked perfectly.  Seriously.  The best pizza I've had since Waterfront Pizza in Port Townsend, Washington.   The cheesecake made the whole trip worth it.  The service was great. The place is pretty small and would have a hard time with a large crowd as the dining room might seat 50 people at capacity.  But the intimacy made it perfect for a family or a date night.  Oh and the jalapeño poppers were yummy too! Good job Pizza Heaven.  Ask for River too. He knows that menu in and out and will help make great suggestions."}
{"text":"We had their cheese pizza and wings, it was pretty good. The best thing about the pizza was the crust. The wings were nothing special."}
{"text":"We had the Vegan Mediterranean pizza which was amazing but the sauce lacked flavor. The crust and toppings were on point. I added salt because the sauce needed it. We then got the Vegan cheesecake for $7 a very small slice. Oh my gosh please why do they even sell this to the public. I had one bite and in that same bite I wanted to spit it out. It was extremely dry and tasted like cardboard. It was chalky if that makes sense. Please do yourself a favor and don't get this. I told the waitress that they shouldn't sell the cheesecake because it was extremely dry. She said ok I'll let her know. She said that's weird you're the first to say that. I was thinking she probably would take the slice off my receipt but she didn't."}
{"text":"My grandparents and I had a nice evening here. We lucked out and got to see a wonderful pianist and guitarist sing and perform! Apparently they do that every Friday night from 7:30-9:30pm. It truly made the night for us. The food was a little slow to come out and it took a while for us to get our check, but staff were still friendly. All of our food was authentic and delicious! I will say I think the tables are a little close together because before the musicians came, I could hear all the conversations around us way too easily. Would recommend this place on a Friday night for sure though!"}
{"text":"There's something that screams COMFORT FOOD about this place...italian comfort food. Almost like a home cooked meal by your italian relatives in NY. The prices are very reasonable and the food exceeds that price point. Their meatball app is delicious and tastes very authentic, pizza is delicious as well. The server was also very sweet and attentive.  Overall, great food for a great price."}
{"text":"Homemade Italian food. Just like what I remember in Italy. If you want to escape and feel like you are away in Italy for a night, then this is the place. Homemade sausage is too die for."}
{"text":"I brought my husband first time, & not happy with the service & loud music.  I always come here with a good friend of mine.  My review is changed because pizza was burnt, and owner talking about a customer who brought in a man helping in a film. First of all the customer was me & as a kind person that I am I treated this person to lunch as a thank you, I do all the time, owners should not talk about people, cause you never know who they are, & badmouth staff inappropriate.  Now, I & many of my Well known friends all over will not go. Think about you business."}
{"text":"So, I'm a big pizza person and I thought it was just ok honestly. Mainly because of the crust (too hard, flavorless) and lack of sauce (could've used more), the toppings were great though (we got the veggie pizza). Our server was good, attentive, funny, helpful in answering our questions. I did find the vegan veggie balls to be absolutely fantastic! The vegan cheesecake was eh (too dry/flavorless).  The vegan baked ziti was pretty good too. Overall it was just ok for me. I'm kinda picky when it comes to pizza and the crust and sauce I feel make it amazing or just bleh."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for about seven years now and not once have we ever been disappointed with the service. And yesterday, Valentines Day 2018, was no different. When we got there we were greeted by the owner, I don't really know her name, but she told us to sit where we liked because none of the servers had shown up yet due to slow traffic and rain. While the owner had NO SERVERS she got us our drinks and took out order without any attitude, or bad tone. She was so helpful and courteous and quick. We weren't the only customers there so her speedy service was amazing. The food was amazing, as usual, the service was great(considering), and the owner was incredible. That's how a business should be run."}
{"text":"At lunch here today.  I had the wings and a slice.  Great wings and great pizza for a fair price.  I don't think you can go wrong here!!!    Louisa, the cashier, is on her game and will take good care of you."}
{"text":"Place is okay. Food is decent. Have had some unpleasant conversations on the phone while trying to order food with the staff being rude and kinda bitchy. But we all have bad days. Unfortunately for them I don't think I will be going back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I recommend the lasagna or baked ziti! Great service. Excellent food, they even accepted the entertainment coupon! A+"}
{"text":"This place is a good little pizza joint. My husband and I are both vegan and I love that have an entire vegan section on their menu. It's a place we can share with all of friends and family; where all are happy. The vegan Agave BBQ pizza is my favorite and the veggie balls are pretty darn good, too. They also have a vegan each for their salads. It also makes a great dip for your pizza. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ugh, I've ordered delivery from here before and it has been hit and miss, but my last delivery Friday night was the final straw.  The large cheese pizza for the kids was tasteless; the cheese was thick and gross.  The crust was not bad on the edges, but was really underbaked for most of the middle of the pizza.  For me, I ordered the vegan sausage and cheese pizza; it was so horrible looking I took a picture.  I found a couple slices that looked almost baked so I ate what amounted to one slice; pretty flavorless as well.  $33 for pizza that no one liked.  Will never order again."}
{"text":"This place has the vest vegan pizza I have EVER had. Unreal.Our server, Shaun, took such good care of us and even braught us a vegan dessert when we were done!! Best place in Phoenix for a bite!!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the food at Pizza Heaven since I moved to Phoenix from the East Valley 3 1/2 yrs ago. My first experience was not so good. I called in my order and the lady who answered was a bit rude. My food was supposed to be ready in about a 1/2 hr but that was not the case. One of the guys gave me and my brother-in-law a piece of pizza to sample since we were waiting so long. Apparently there was some confusion about my order being pick up or delivery. An hr after I called in the order, my food magically appeared. It was sitting on top of the oven. I was angry. But when I bit into the vegan delight, all my anger subsided. The BEST vegan sausage and vegan cheese I have ever tasted.   My husband and I fell in love w the vegan menu and I'm embarrassed to say we went there 4xs in one week. It is that good!!! We picked up the same pizza 2 nights later and then dined in and our waiter was phenomenal. Not like the lady who answers the phones. The vegan starter w veggies and bread was so Delish. I think it was called the Mediterranean Medley. The next time my husband picked up vegan sandwiches and the veggie ball sandwich was out of this world!!! Food is fantastic!!!! Now if they could just give the phone answerer an attitude adjustment, this place would be perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven has been on my list to try for quite some time now & I honestly haven't gone because I initially thought it would be more on the comfort food side rather than healthy quality food, boy was I wrong.  Last Saturday night after I over worked out myself, my body just needed some... CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach.   Oh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.  I talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.  I cannot wait to go back. This was exactly what my body needed last Saturday. I really enjoyed my experience & the amazing food."}
{"text":"Best vegan pizza place in Az!!I will be back Everything was good from A to Z.and I just love how next door they have unami serving vegan ice cream shake and all kind of goodies!! this is worth the drive and it will definitely be our spot when friend wants to eat pizza because they have both option vegan and non-vegan option they know what they are doing.5/5 for sure!:) go and try it you wont be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I heard about the vegan options it sounded too good to be true... a real Italian restaurant with vegan choices? Well, this place just keeps getting better. I have always loved their vegan calzone and their vegan baked ziti, but recently they actually added a whole separate vegan menu with extra vegan options and the last time I was there the wait staff told me (or rather, they told my omnivore mother, who is much less shy and much more talkative than I am) that the owner was so pleased with how well the vegan menu was doing that they were planning on adding even more options in the near future.  So far I have had (that I can remember) the vegan calzone, the vegan baked ziti, the veggieballs, the hot veggie sandwich with vegan cheese and the angel bites. If you ask, they will also make you vegan garlic bread, although I don't believe that's actually on the menu yet. All of it is great, although the angel bites could have been a little bit sweeter or more interesting considering that's their only vegan dessert option so far.  Also, the vegan calzones make for great leftovers, especially if you ask for a little to-go container for the sauce as well so you can dip it. I have done this multiple times."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding--it's one of the best pizza places in the valley.  I eat here all the time.  However, the service staff gets overwhelmed easily and it's hard to get refills sometimes, we've waited a long time for our bill more than once, and there doesn't seem to be a good reason for the delays.  The food is aces, and they have terrific options for vegans, unlike most pizza places.  EDIT: We ate there tonight, and it was really, really busy, but they did a much better job of attending to us, so I added a star.  I'm a fair-minded person.  The food really is aces."}
{"text":"I am very skeptical when it comes to Italian food. Considering I'm first generation in the United States. I'm originally from NY that goes with out sayin. I've been out here for almost 8 years and one thing I haven't found was a decent Italian place. My husband found a Groupon for this place and figure why not try it. He knows I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food. It's a little small place. However, excellent service. Our waitress was very good. Our Groupon was $40.00 worth of food. The food was out of this world. We had mozzarella sticks,the meat lovers pizza, and 2 pasta dishes . Very reasonable pricing. Owner is very well mannered and came over to us. Honestly I typically don't go to a resturant twice unless I really like it. This is going to be my regular Italian place. Make no mistakes about that."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!!! By far one of the hidden gems, I stumbled on as I transitioned over into veganism. I've passed by this place time after time; I thought it was a regular pizza place, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!! The owner here has dedicated a portion of her menu to the vegan community, and the crazy thing is non vegans even order vegan items because they can't deny the taste, flavor and that extra umph, their secret ingredient LOVE. That goes into all her dishes made here. This place is one of, if not the only place that doesn't use diaya cheese for their vegan pizza and the difference is astronomical!!! By far one of thee best pizza I've EVER HAD vegan or not! Please treat yourself to this place it's a guilty pleasure for vegans and non vegans alike."}
{"text":"So thankful for their vegan menu! From pizza, calzones, sandwiches and even cheesecake they have a huge variety.  Every item I've had has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything from the pizza on down to the wings is top notch.  They are very gluten-free friendly (which makes my girl's life a lot easier - and by default, mine also).  It's a quick turnaround and the setting is perfect with a cool little bar.  Great atmosphere, fantastic food."}
{"text":"We have consistently ordered from Pizza Heaven for years. For the first time ever we received a sub par delivery. We felt so bad complaining, but again we always have had the best pizza from this place so this was abnormal.  The staff and manager were so apologetic and immediately delivered the pizza heaven pie we have come to know and love.  Thank you Pizza Heaven for coming through!"}
{"text":"I am confused about all the hype. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza (which was on special for 11.99) and 20 wings. My order came out to $34.00.  Holy shit! $1.10 per wing? Are you serious? \"Better be some damn good wings\", I thought to myself..  Homie on the phone said my delivery would take 30-45 minutes. Ya.. No. Add an hour to that.   Pizza and wings finally arrived, and I was fucking starving.. Honestly.. the pizza was bad. I want chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and stretchy cheese. Pizza Heaven offers none of these mandatory pizza components..  The wings were soggy on the outside, and over cooked on the inside. The meat was tough, and stringy.  What a waste of time, and money. Don't be fooled by some of the reviews on here.. What I experienced was nothing short of Pizza Hell-"}
{"text":"I was soooo happy when i open the menu and there was a vegan/vegetarian page.   Good customer service,  good pizza :) Its a small place, but great atmosphere!   No hot sauce nor ranch :("}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant, picked it because they have vegan options along with reguar menu for our omni friends. FANTASTIC!! Vegan calzone with their soy sausage was devine! Baked ziti and spaghetti with veggieballs were equally scrumptious. Pizzas and breadsticks (nonvegan) were also super yummy!! Definitely will be going back! Yumm"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I had never eaten here until last night.   Went to eat with 2 friends with different food requirements. We all 3 ate with no issues.   Great portions. Great flavor. Good service.  I had the baked ziti with the meat sauce. Others had the vegan baked ziti and the vegan sausage and pepper sandwich. Started the meal with a Caprise Salad.   We all brought home leftovers. Great lunch today."}
{"text":"This place has amazing vegan pizza.  Really, really amazing vegan pizza with soy cheese and soy sausage.    I think one of the hardest things about not being able to eat dairy is not being able to eat pizza, so this place is a dream come true for anyone who is dairy-free.  The style of the cheese (melts well), the thickness of the crust (tastes very similar to many East Coast pizzerias), and the subtle taste of sausage (it's made with fennel to give it taste without tasting too meaty) make this piece of pizza a serious slice of heaven.    They have gluten-free pizza and the crust is from a local bakery.  If you happen to have a problem, talk to the owner.  She's very receptive.  Also, she's appreciative of inputs from vegans.    Yum, yum, yum.  Go here."}
{"text":"Of course I'd find out about this place right before I move out of Arizona. Pizza Heaven has, hands-down, some of the best pizza I've ever had. Bonus: They are incredibly vegetarian- and vegan-friendly! The owner makes almost everything from scratch and uses a vegan cheese that doesn't taste like wax. Will definitely visit when I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My vegetarian boyfriend and I love Pizza Heaven's vegan sausage. He thought I had made a mistake when ordering, but I assured him that I hadn't - it really was vegan sausage. The sauce was flavorful and the crust perfectly baked. The dough ball dessert was terrible (can't remember what it was called), so pass on that. But, the pizza was the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"We got a groupon and was not impressed. Overall rating 5 out of 10.  Food was ok. Waitress was bothered by us.  It was hot in there.  I did like their pasta alfredo Primavera.   The other thing I didn't like is they only have one bathroom for everyone."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my whole experience at Pizza Heaven. We came in on a Friday night for a pick up order, but stayed to enjoy the live music at the bar for a while as well. Also stoked because they deliver to my neighborhood, which I would've guessed is outside the delivery area.   Pizza was good. Crust good, not too doughy or crispy. I would suggest not going too crazy on the custom toppings because they can add up and be pricy. Luckily the girl at the counter was nice and warned us the pizza we were crafting was going to end up being pretty expensive, so we took her suggestion to revise and it was much more reasonable. They're definitely my go to pizza in the neighborhood. Have ordered from them several times and they're always consistent.  Their wings are good, salads are good--really haven't ordered anything that's been a disappointment yet. They also have a good reasonably priced lunch slice special. Definitely worth stopping by if you're craving a slice and in the area."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night, with a Groupon. It's a small establishment with a compact parking lot, and both were jam-packed. Luckily, someone was leaving as I was pulling into the lot, so I was able to grab a spot. (I don't know if they have an overflow lot, but they should.)   Once inside, I quickly observed the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign.  We were asked how many were in our party, after which the hostess/waitress (they seem to be one in the same) scurried off to assess the availability.  As said earlier, it was packed, and there were others also waiting.  I was thinking we'd have to wait forever and that my starving spirit animal would come bursting out of my abdomen, like in those beef jerky commercials. But we ended up waiting no more than about 5 minutes before we were shown to a booth. (I love booths!)  DESIGNATED VEGAN MENU: There's a vegan menu inserted inside of their regular menu.  The waitress said that patrons keep taking them out, so if you want the vegan menu and don't see it, just ask for one.  The vegan options include appetizers, hot stuffed sandwiches, pasta, calzone, pizzas, and desserts.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but they also have a vegan cheesecake, which you can get topped with chocolate syrup or mixed berry sauce.    My order: Veggieballs in buffalo hot sauce -  They are described as vegan meatballs, so I'm thinking faux-beef \"meat\" balls. I was pleasantly surprised when I cut into one and found actual vegetables: peas, string beans, carrots, & corn. They were positively delicious. A slightly crispy coating covered in a proper buffalo sauce, which had a legit heat level. Excellent dish for only $5.95. Comes w/ vegan ranch and carrot sticks.   Vegan Spaghetti with soy sausage, $8.50 - (Beautiful presentation.) The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce and the soy sausage were bland, however.  Aside from flavor, I don't know what to say that it was lacking. A dash of this? A splash of that? Not sure, but it was a pretty big boring bowl of blah. I kept furiously twirling my fork in the saucy mix, thinking that maybe the flavor was at the bottom somewhere, clicking its heels thrice and trying to get back home, but no luck. If you avoid salt/seasoning (and flavor), as well as meat, then this is your dish. I liked the vegan garlic bread though.    Dessert- Vegan cheesecake w/ mixed berry sauce, $6.50 - I never ate cheese before going vegan, but I used to eat cheesecake (weird, I know), so I do have something with which to compare vegan versions. I have had some better-than-real-cheesecake vegan cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them. I did not like it. The cheesecake had a weird, grainy, earthy taste to it. And it was like, almost smooth & creamy, (*singing* Ooooh, we're 1/2 way theeeere...) but it didn't quite make it there.  Silver lining? The crust and mixed berry sauce were both good.  Angel bites, $4.95 - (If you've ever been to France or New Orleans, think beignets, except here, they are vegan.) They cover theirs with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they offer you one of 3 dipping sauces: agave, chocolate, or caramel. (The caramel is NOT vegan, fyi.) I chose the chocolate. O-M-G. These suitably named bites of awesomeness brought me life. They came out hot, fresh & ready to be devoured. This is one of those treats that you want to eat right away because you know they won't taste the same later. But they give you so many! (Which is a great thing!) You can easily share this dessert with 2 or more people.   Non vegan: My non-veggie DD got the Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer, and the Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta w/ shrimp added. She liked the pasta, but said it was definitely spicy.      Nice ambience, especially for dates. I don't know if they take reservations, but I suggest asking, especially for busy weekend nights.  As busy as they were, the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites."}
{"text":"I like the lunch special and that this place isn't that crowded. I can stop in here and check email while having lunch with no problems. The TV usually has a game on to watch as well. The pizza is pretty good. The dining area is a little dark, but it is never really that busy, and the food comes out quick."}
{"text":"Took my wife, son and Grandmother for lunch. We throughly enjoy all the food we selected. We start with an order of the Veggie Balls with Marinara. Definitely worth trying yourself we all loved them. We got one vegan and one regular Pizza and both were wonderful. We will definitely be back to try the other vegan options."}
{"text":"We are always looking for new places to try on Groupon and Living Social and came across this fabulous place a few years back. It's a small family owned business and every dish tastes amazing and fresh! The prices and portions are great and everyone we have brought along with us each time we go is impressed. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time on my lunch break also moved here from NYC. Very much reminded me of Home!!!!! Great food, super service and reasonably priced!!! Will definely go back!!!"}
{"text":"A classmate and I stumbled across this place famished, we were hesitant to stop since they didn't have many cars (Sunday evening 6:30).  So glad we did!  We were impressed by the service and class this small mom and pop restaurant offered.  Sangria is delicious...way way better than most places.  Lasagna is delicious and enough for 2!  Heard there are many business in the area order take out out from here regularly."}
{"text":"This may have been some of the best Italian take out I have had in the midtown/downtown Phoenix area in a long time. The husband and I picked up some delicious food here last night. We split a calzone with pepperoni and basil, a side of meatballs, and an order of garlic bread. Total? 18$...whaaaat?!?! Awesome! and it was a ton of food too. The meatballs were really good, soft, but not too soft, and flavorful. The garlic bread was nothing too special, but it was standard. The calzone was very good. They loaded this thing with basil, it wasn't like a little bit here and there, so I appreciated that. Additionally, it had a lot of pepperoni...too much for me, but the husband loved that. They top the calzone with garlic and bake until it's golden brown.... this thing was so delicious and large, we certainly had leftovers. I also found out that this place will deliver all the way out to my house at 15th ave and mcdowell....awesome! This may be my new go to pizza.    PS this place is very accommodating, they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!"}
{"text":"I used to live about a quarter mile from Pizza Heaven. The pizza's ok but I'd have to agree with Dave B, it is lacking a bit of flavor. I prefer NYPD instead. It's very clean inside, and the staff is nice. Also they have gluten-free and other healthy options. This place gets packed on Friday nights; you can usually park at the auto repair place next to it."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, might I suggest the chicken chipotle and cilantro pizza! So many great flavors going on. Not as good as Stumpy's up the street though or Cibo downtown."}
{"text":"Hooray for delicious gluten free and dairy free pizza!! So good you won't believe it.   I was a little worried about the vegan cheese, but the consistency and texture was great. The pizza I had was so so good. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"while I prefer vegan and my husband is a total carnivore-this little but delicious family owned restaurant is able to please us both!  Loved my vegan meatball sandwich w/ salad (vegan ranch!!!)  and my husband had parmigiana chicken pasta.  We were both quite satisfied and loved our dinners.  Plus-his was so big that he actually had enough for his lunch brown bag the next day!  That has almost never happened before!"}
{"text":"The vegan options here are incredible and they deliver! I love the baked ziti with vegan sausage and the pizza options with vegan cheese are all delicious. The \"meatballs\" with the buffalo sauce are addictive.. I have never been disappointed with the Pizza Heaven vegan menu"}
{"text":"I'm still searching for the best pizza in Phoenix....so far, I think Pizza Heaven takes the cake.  I go here with coworkers on lunch breaks.  They have a really good lunch special you can choose between pizza and their one-of-a-kind hot wings.  You'll melt if you order them hot.  I did that and I'm still paying for it.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  Great atmosphere.  Delicious pizza.  And a tv.  What more could you want out of a pizza place?"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Saturday night with no wait or crowd...which was no indication of the quality of this place.  We started with the Italian cheese bread, which was the perfect consistency and a good size for two to share. For our meals, we had the Lasagna and Chicken Parmesan sandwich, both of which were incredible and very filling...my girlfriend couldn't even finish the lasagna. Our friends we were with got the vegan ravioli which tasted like it had real cheese!  For dessert we had the angel bites, which were light and sweet. You'll easily eat through the whole plate with a few people. Too many for just a single person though.  This is a great place for a cozy dinner out at a great-tasting, casual Italian bistro. From what we're told by our vegan friends, they have a really good vegan menu."}
{"text":"My brother had the Chipotle Chicken Pasta and I am going back for that myself soon. I stuck to basic pizza. Great lunch deal. 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4.00. They even have gluten free options available, which is great for GF people. I want to try the Chipotle Shrimp Pasta too."}
{"text":"The pizzas are good, but nothing special. However, the calzones, especially in their wheat crust, are the best ones I've ever eaten.  Those things are amazing!  Try them with either meatballs or their home made sausage.  These babies are huge and really, really good."}
{"text":"So so food but sweet staff and low prices got the 4th star, waitress was a honey"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon and it was well worth it. Our waiter, River was very attentive without being overbearing. The pizza was delicious. We got \"the works\" which was loaded with yummy stuff. We also got the cheese bread which was literally garlic bread with mozzarella slapped on top. It was surprisingly good for how basic it was.   The decor of this restaurant is super basic. Nothing special. The inside was very dark.. looked like a basement. There was no live music when we went so we sat outside.  I will return!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last year using a discount voucher and I really liked it. Very friendly family owned restaurant. The decor is really cute..... kind of romantic. Nice first  date kind of place. The food is good if I might add. I think everyone needs to try this place and judge for yourself. I really don't think you will be disappointed. I have been back several times since and I just noticed another discount voucher notice on Groupon and I am going to nab it right now. I know I probably shouldn't do that since I know I like the restaurant, but I am also a sucker for a good deal and good food!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Lasagna and the Pizza from Pizza Heaven Bistro. My boyfriend and I first tried this spot because of the Groupon and we go at least every other week just for a great slice and the small friendly environment. I was able to meet the owner and absolutely love her spirit and passion for her business. It is also great that everything is made from scratch."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the vegan menu is excellent! I honestly did like everything and I would recommend vegans going there for sure because they use better ingredients than most other vegan restaurants. I had the vegan meatballs and they offer a few sauces to try with it and they were all good.   I'm also a meat eater so I ordered the cajun chicken alfredo because thats what was recommended popular. I tried it and it was just grainy to each bite and not at all what I expected. If you like cheese with a side of spice and chicken then this would be your go to (but remember; grainy texture).   I politely told my server that I was not satisfied with my order and to just swap it out with the spaghetti and meatballs. He completely understood (from what I could tell) and about 10 minutes later I got my new order. My first bite was amazing, totally worth it. After a couple more bites, even better. But this is what got to me, and this is EVERYONE'S worst fear at a restaurant. I spooled my fork to get a nice spoonful of everything and stared at my next bite and saw a nice thick black hair in it!!  This was flipping gross and what was worse is that it didn't look like it fell out, it looked like it was plucked out and placed in my plate because a nice white ROOT tip was on the end. I stayed calm (unlike most people) and I already felt bad I swapped out my plate but my friend said something to our waiter and he apologized and said he would he get my friend dessert (I guess for us all??). Instead of me FREAKING OUT, I was calm and making it an eventful experience. At the end he still billed me for the appetizer I ordered earlier (which I know is fair, but at the same time; a hair. come on.)   I will not be going here again because aside of the big thick black hair in my spaghetti and meatballs, I left hungry. (They didnt offer another plate for me to have or anything)."}
{"text":"SO much yum.  They have an all vegan menu. it's delicious. I ordered the vegan baked ziti with soy sausage (Yum! and big! but i would have appreciated more distribution of cheese/sausage thru the pasta instead of just on top)  the calzone was quite good but i wish i hadn't gotten the broccoli in it.  the veggieballs (vegan meatballs) are SCRUMPTIOUS. get them. yum.  The angel bites....(marshmallow consistency fluffed fried dough with sugar on top.) lived up to their name. But they need some sort of fruity sauce or sorbet to accompany them to put them over the top.  in short: don't miss this place especially if you're veg!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for dinner. Very nice inside, comfortable seating. Multiple vegan pizza options."}
{"text":"Great place for delivery Italian food in Central Phoenix. My girlfriend and I ordered the Greek medley, la greca, and spaghetti and meatballs and were blown away. The medley is kalamata olives, feta cheese, mushrooms, and red peppers in a great balsamic vinegar and olive oil concoction. Sarah had the penne la greca with shrimp. She is giving it two thumbs up. I absolutely loved the spaghetti. Perfect pasta, a nice simple delicious marinara. The meatballs were done perfectly. They were juicy, tender, seasoned perfectly, and the star of my meal. I will definitely order again and again."}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven is one of our favorite places to eat! The vegan options are delicious! The service is absolutely top notch!  Farshaud is amazing and so attentive! Patricia, the owner is absolutely delightful! Live music is a great addition to an awesome ambiance!"}
{"text":"I purchased a voucher from Living Social; $10 for $20 towards food.  I'd gitten a sweet PayPal deal a while back and we enjoyed the pizza so I bought this voucher.  I am so pleased that I did.  We sat in a bck booth (luckily away from the live musician).  We ordered baked ziti and spinach lasagna.   The hubby go a sald yo go with his ziti and I got Reisling with my spinach lasagna.  The dishes came piping hoy and cheesy.   The hubby's ziti was the perfect texture, sauce amoubt and crispy cheese was amazing.  My loaded spinach lasagna was firm, full of spichach and covered in cheese.  I have to say the salad and wine were noyhing spectacular but functional.   The garlic toast was soft and buttery as well.  The service was adequate; perhaps a little slow even though it wasn't super busy.  The biggest complaint the live musician who was a good background music piano player but when he sang it was embarrassing.   He wad not good.  Would have been had he not sung at all.  Otherwise it was a terrific Friday night dinner out."}
{"text":"I moved to Phx in July 2001, having only visited once during December with friends from Ohio/Michigan. When it came time to escape Ohio, initially with a very good friend who wanted to move to Tucson to acclimate us to city life (I was raised in a village of 500+- people, including the rural setting of my parents) and within five years move to Phoenix, just so we didn't suffer culture shock. Remember, I'd only been in Phx for 3 days up to that point in my life, with neither friend nor family binding me to Arizona. However, he decided the week before our departure date that he wasn't ready to move so far away from family. I, however, had turned in my month's notice to both my full-time job as a journalist and part-time job at Wal-Mart (don't judge me! The employee discount was worth it) so had to make a decision: Tucson or Phoenix. It was during the final minutes, literally, that I mapped out my trip to Phoenix. See, my dad's a truck driver and I have some of his ability to navigate through cities and states using this amazing invention called an atlas. Thanks to Grandma O'Neill, I had such a magical device in my possession, and wrote out in a matter of minutes the best route to drive my Kia Sportage and U-haul trailer from Northwest Ohio to Central Arizona, avoiding toll roads and steep inclines. Unfortunately, I had to drive through the panhandle of Texas, where I almost decided I'd had enough and was going to return to Ohio. But, I drove on. And on, and on...   What this has to do with Pizza Heaven is simply background information. After 2.5 days of driving and sleeping in a truck stop one night, I was ready to settle in and have a filling meal. A pizza, actually. And something that would inaugurate my coming to a new home: Mexican Pizza. Refried bean and cheese and green onions...it's a shame I couldn't find it on their menu after returning a year later. But, PH managed to offer specialty pizzas that filled that void (almost :( ) and has been a stand-by for several events at a friend's house. [My friend's house is outside their delivery range and we gladly pay the extra fee, which says a lot.]   Although I've only eaten inside the restaurant twice, and must agree that service tended to be on the slower side, this did allow our groups to mingle more and enjoy the pizza and wine at our leisure.   Thanks for the memories, Pizza Heaven. You've remained solid in my heart since the day I drove into town and stayed at the only hotel on the only street I could recall in this wonderful City. I ;hearts& PHX."}
{"text":"Today is my 21st birthday and after some unfortunately events, I was on my way out for a nice dinner with myself. First off, their customer service is outstanding! My family lives in California, so my dad called Pizza Heaven and told them he wanted to secretly pay for my dinner. I had no idea so when I go to the restaurant and was served a glass of their house chianti- which I'd recommend highly. I was given great service through out the entire meal and they were so great in making me feel special on my birthday! I did't even mention yet that they have GREAT vegan options! If you are a vegan/vegetarian you know how hard it is to go out to eat, but I was able to get an appetizer, entree and delicious vegan cheesecake dessert without hassle. This place is such a great hidden gem, I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The best pizza places I have been to. Has a \"home\" like atmosphere rather then being at chain restaurant. Food is fantastic made to perfection. Service right when you walk in the door until you leave out the door."}
