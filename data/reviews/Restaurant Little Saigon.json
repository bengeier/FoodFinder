{"text":"Ordered delivery! The service to my place was very fast!  They have an awesome delivery system on their website that makes it very easy so you don't have to call to order. They confirmed my order by phone after it was placed to double check everything.  The food was delicious!  Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service médiocre mais nourriture excellente.   Une fois arrivé le serveur viens rapidement nous porter de l'eau. Comme il n'y a qu'un seul serveur (euse), c'est donc très long a se faire servir. Par chance, les plats sont arrivés rapidement et étaient délicieux. Le général tao est vraiment très bon."}
{"text":"Why doesn't Yelp have negative ratings?  This place is pure crap.  Service is slow and inefficient, because they only have 1 chef and 1 waitress on a busy Saturday night.  The food is alright, but the service is just unbearable. I waited for 45 minutes for a bowl of pho, and had to remind the waitress about it because apparently the cook forgot it... 45 minutes!!! FOR PHO!!?? Gosh...  Then when she gave me the food, there was no apologies or anything. The worst of all, it was not even the pho I ordered. So I had her return the dish and ended up not paying for it. A Saturday night dinner with a friend ended up like this, just bad.  I still left her 10% tips despite all this, but she somehow had the guts to tell me I should give 15%...  How does this place even exist?"}
{"text":"I was questioning all the negative reviews thinking this place might be under new management. The shrimp salad rolls were the best I've ever tasted even compared to back home in Vancouver and the Pho soup was good to even though it wasn't the right pho I ordered.   Then..... Found a hair in my food"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after my spa day. I stopped by this restaurant because I was feeling some pho. For a large, it was 8,95 and I ate it in less than 15 minutes. I haven't had a pho for so long that I do enjoy it. I guess I can say it tastes decently for good pho but I had better elsewhere.   The service was quick on a Friday night and I had no troubles with ordering unlike most reviews. I would have ordered desserts but they were out of the one I wanted."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place :) The phos are delicious (especially with their brown sauce). The general tao is great. And it's cheap. Love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant put waaaay too much MSG in their pho to the point that I couldn't even move for several hours after finishing the pho. Service was bland, the restaurant seems like an old broken building."}
