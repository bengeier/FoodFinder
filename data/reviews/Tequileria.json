{"text":"Margarita was tasty. Food was decent, but seriously, who doesn't double stack their corn tortillas for tacos?!? A single corn tortilla has zero structural integrity, so I'm left forking my taco (Lame pun intended)."}
{"text":"Sit down to walk out time: 50 min~  Ordered the Tequileria Burger and it did not disappoint. It was juicy, with a nice blend of the onion and chipotle aioli flavor.   Given I ordered my food at the same time as my drink, I felt I was there a little too long. I would suggest their \"Pronto\" side counter service if your boarding time is coming up soon."}
{"text":"Never again!  I wish I had checked my Yelp app before I sat down at the bar - then I would have known how bad this place was. Terrible service and when the bartender finally took my order after ignoring me multiple times for 10 minutes the \"Ultimate Margarita\" was anything but ultimate! More like \"Sour and Weak\". Complained to the bartender that this was the wrong drink but he assured me it was right. Also ordered a Shrimp appetizer and after waiting 20 minutes and still no food I paid for my drink and left hungry."}
{"text":"Stefanie made me the BEST strawberry margarita that I've had in my entire life. An awesome way to pass the time during a cruddy layover!"}
{"text":"I've been connecting in Charlotte for years now, and this was the first time I ate at Tequileria.  I always thought they were more of a bar than a place to get real Mexican food.  However, I noticed they had some authentic looking items on the menu, like tamales, carnitas, and enchilada suiza.    I ordered the jicama salad and had shrimp added.  It was quite good, and I've never seen such large chunks of jicama in my dish before!  There were jicama bricks in there!  Still, I managed to slice them and eat them during my long layover, and I was quite pleased.  Other items in the salad were shredded lettuce, tomatoes and large pieces of cucumber and 8 medium sized shrimp.    I would go back now and try something more hearty now that the salad was up to par."}
{"text":"avg price and what not for an airport  however if you spend 7 minutes to place an order to make sure you don't get gluten you better not give the woman gluten.  And so I spent the night holding hair as she lost those flour tortillias.    They did offer to comp the meal but if you have an allergy that doesn't cut it"}
{"text":"My brother and I always come here when we fly out after visiting the family at Christmas.  It's our little tradition, getting shots of Agavero and nachos before we head back to our own ends of the country.    If you are looking for a shot of something at Charlotte Douglas, this is a decent place for good tequila."}
{"text":"People who like food should not eat here. I had chicken tacos on corn tortillas. It cost 900 dollars, the tortillas were mush so I had to eat it with a fork, and the chicken was dry and tasteless. The salsa tasted like jarred old El Paso. Had they not made me needlessly wait for 10 minutes for my tacos, perhaps the mush factor would have been less, but the dry and tasteless problem wouldn't have changed. Seriously, I want my hunger back. I have wasted a good meal."}
{"text":"Bland food was the only bright spot in this place. The service was horrendous. The waitress hit me from behind with a tray, she didn't come to the table for 15 minutes before taking our order, she didn't bring plates for the nachos or any forks and knives, no sweetener for the tea, and it goes on. The quickest thing I got was the check and that was AFTER I walked to find the waitress to ask for it.  Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Stay away...aweful margarita and horrible nachos...they dumped salsa all over the nachos, which made it soggy....this shouldn't be considered a mexican restaurant....horrible service at bar...bartender was not friendly and in rush...music seemed to be on repeat...and all you hear is pitbull and JLO.....and I usually don't mind their music."}
{"text":"After a close inspection of the menu, the salad is the closest item that can even remotely be considered healthy. I stayed with the grilled chicken, and it tasted like it was boiled, no texture, I am not even sure what I put into my mouth.  Suffice to say, stay away from the chicken. The cheese sauce, what they call \"queso fresco\" is nothing at all fresco and all disgustingo. Their dressing is equally disgusting, not even remotely considered \"mexican\" nor is it fit for human consumption. Beware of the bacon bits, if they were repurposed for doggie treats, I'd feel obliged to call the ASPCA for inhumane treatment.  I ordered the Platino Margarita, pretty sure It was $17, it calls for fresh lime juice they put some premixed stuff in a bottle into my drink and called it a day. Even the drink was subpar and worth less than half the cost that they charged.   If you happen to land in Charlotte because American Airline sucks and refuses to help you out, stay away from this restaurant. Even their customer service sucks, which surprisingly is the least of their problems. Decor is not bad."}
{"text":"Unless you have lots and lots of time between flights,  don't try to eat here. It took 15 minutes to just get the drinks and to take our order. Never did get our food after 45 min. Paid for the pops and left. Can't rate the food only the service."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow.  If you have a flight to catch, forget this place.  Lackadaisical seems to be the there... Understaffed - took 10+ minutes just to get a waitresses attention and another  30+ minutes for cold  Mexican food to be prepared and delivered to the table.  Something is amiss and my rating is actually zero stars"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa seemed like they were bought from Sam's club and served directly to our table. The margarita was really good. However, there were no prices on the menu, and it turns out they charge $13.50 for their lowest level, house margarita. Unbelievable. Stay away."}
{"text":"We had a large chicken quesadilla. It's hard to mess up a quesadilla, but this thing was delicious for being \"fast food.\" It was $8 and two of us ate a tasty meal...not bad for fast airport food!"}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveler, this was my go-to place in the airport between connections.  My usual dish was the chicken verde enchiladas with black beans and rice.  The verde sauce and sour cream were plentiful, the rice flavorful, and the black beans were a nice change from typical refried beans.  They recently pared down the menu but the chicken enchiladas are still offered.  I have tried this dish 3 times since the change and each time is equally awful.  What the heck is going on???  I have to order extra verde sauce and sour cream because all that is given now is a scant squirt of each.  The rice is now a very bland white rice with some green specks of maybe parsley?  Black beans are now replaced with refried beans that are as equally bland as the rice.  Three times is enough.  I am sorry to scratch this one off the list.  I predict that this restaurant will close in the near future."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst meal I have ever had in my life. I am writing this after I've just vomited in the bathroom. Do NOT eat here. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Have $23 to blow on a wrap smaller than a midgets fist? Then this is the joint for you! Got a chicken bacon ranch wrap with 60+ grams of carbs, 50+ grams of fat, and 23 grams of protein. Don't even care about the nutritional value, just curious where the heck it came from considering the wrap had no sauce, no chicken, and half a piece of bacon.  Might never fly us air again just to avoid this terminal."}
{"text":"Tasha. That's who you should see when you come here. She was fantastic. She works hard, was quite attentive even during what seemed to be a peak hour, and very friendly. The food was reasonable, pretty good beer selection, and reasonable prices for the airport as a whole. Pretty much the only place I'll eat in CLT."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Wretched  service. Vastly overpriced. I would rather starve than eat here again."}
{"text":"Started off asking bartender to change one of the tvs (all on basketball) to a golf tournament in Mexico & he wouldn't, stating management said it had to stay on bball. Golf in Mexico seems a bit more appropriate. My boyfriend said \"well you're lucky the food & drinks are great then\". The bartender replied \"why am I lucky?\"  Well, because we're assuming tips matter to you/our $100 tab means something to the owner.  The bartender hurried us, was very sarcastic, unaccomodating, and clearly didn't care whether we stayed or left.  So we finished up our meals & had more drinks elsewhere.  This is the first time I've ever left a 10% tip, which in all honesty was more than he deserved with his sarcastic/unprofessional service."}
{"text":"I wandered by this place like 4 times before deciding to go in, and it was so good!  For an airport eatery, it actually wasn't as expensive as I was expecting.  I ordered the chips and salsa and a chicken quesadilla, and I got a box to bring the leftovers home because it was so good.  I was just googling it to see if there were any locations closer to me, and Yelp popped up, so had to leave a review!"}
{"text":"Wish I would have looked at Yelp before coming here. Ordered lunch and a Bloody Mary. The food was as you'd expect from an airport. However the Bloody Mary was undrinkable. Tasted like tomato juice and vodka with a horrible metallic aftertaste. Took one sip and returned it. And of course the full amount showed up up my bill. Just keep walking. Plenty of other places in CLT to choose from."}
{"text":"Service was really slow, and the food was barely warm and tasted like well nothing. This type of restaurant can't survive any place but a airport.  Charlotte needs to raise the bar and get some good local restaurants In there terminals. Lay overs here are not good"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not drink the water. I drink only tap water, but for this place I had to make an exception. The tap water was absolutely gross. It tasted literally like dirty feet. We even asked about it and they refused to discuss it. I asked if the ice was made with the same water and they said no but gave no explanation as to why the tap water tastes so bad. I don't even think it's legal to serve water that tastes that bad."}
{"text":"Not very good at all.   Chips and salsa were very disappointing, possibly the worst I have had in a restaurant in years.  The tacos were OK.   The pork was moist and tender with a decent flavor, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Not the best. Waiter was very nice though. I was proactive with him reading the reviews that talked about how slow things were. Nachos were overflowing. My wife had the beef tacos. Was in the mood for Mexican while waiting on our connection."}
{"text":"Good environment; however, I highly suggest nothing beyond chips and a drink.  I do not expect airport establishments to be great (or memorable), but the queso was pretty horrible - didn't resemble cheese (aside from the color).  The chicken enchiladas were not good at all and the beans appeared as if they had been scooped and placed on the plate weeks ago (just reheated).  Stick with the chips (no queso) and a drink."}
{"text":"I really want to like the food here. I have tried the veggie tacos (corn) twice and for the money, I always leave hungry. The corn tortillas fall apart so don't even think of eating them like tacos! It's an airport so of course don't expect free chips and salsa and a tiny little cup of guac will cost you extra."}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to have airplane food served to you IN the terminal? Then you've found the right place. Seriously though, this was the worst meal at an airport I've experienced. The service was painfully slow, the food was borderline uneatable, and it was pricey. Wish I'd read the Yelp reviews before entering the shiny exterior!"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in recent memory.  The fish tacos were made inedible by fish that had gone bad.  The Maestro tequila was sour to a level it was undrinkable.  Finally, the salsa with chips (which ARE good) were not refillable- a point not made by our waiter.  If I can convince at least one person to avoid this, I will feel I've accomplished something positive."}
{"text":"As someone else stated I should have known better than to eat Mexican food in North Carolina. It was bland, the meat was not prepared right, the salsa was...well it wasn't salsa. All in all a very disappointing experience and next time I am at this airport I will eat anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Food is average & service marginally better. Beer is cold - primary redeeming factor. In summation, were this place competing outside of an airport - captive audience - it would never survive."}
{"text":"Place charged me 19 dollars for chicken tacos with side of rice and refried beans. Food was also pretty disgusting. Have never felt so ripped off from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. For some reason they feel they can increase profits by giving you portion sizes for meals that wouldn't qualify as an appetizer in most restaurants.   I had the skirt steak. $19 for a piece of meat that was less than 4 ozs.  About 1/4 of it was fat.  Tortillas were hard and rice was basically disgusting.   Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Probably the worse Mexican I've had in my life.   Great service and friendly staff but I really wish I ate at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Was excited for this place. Waited to get in on and it was a waste of time. Margarita tasted like just sour mix yet got charged $16.00. Service was not awesome.. been in the service industry for 10 years and I couldn't even get the girl to smile or seem happy to be here. Had little faith in the food so didn't even order even though I was so excited for tacos. I know it looks fun on the outside.. but save your money!"}
{"text":"For some reason they put a ton of sugar into their Tequila Lime pulled chicken tacos.  They looked pretty decent for airport food, but the heavy use of sugar ruined the meal."}
{"text":"Poor quality food    Worst fish tacos I've ever tried to read.   Extreme salt on beans  rice not just dry some to the stage of being hard.  Limited tequila at excessive price  Not again"}
{"text":"With the sad state of airline food, you hope that the airport restaurants at least dish up something edible.  I know, my first problem was going to a \"Mexican\" restaurant in North Carolina, but the sit-down choices were slim.    Our waitress was very nice.  She was great, I want to be clear on this.    The Jicama Salad was terrible.  Laid on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce was six huge (3/4\") Jicama sticks, four slices of cucumber, and some diced tomato.  The Jicama managed to be chalky and flavorless.    The tamales were also horrible.  They were dry and crunchy.  Aren't tamales steamed?  They failed in the taste category as well.  They came with a rice that might have also been served as really bad fried rice.  I'm still not sure what was in it.    The \"Millionaire\" margaritas ($14, *cough*) would have been great had they been called \"limeade\" and cost a fifth the price.  There may have been tequila in it, I'm not sure.    The total for a salad, two tamales, and two margaritas?  $45, ugh."}
{"text":"Well, I  wanted a place to sit, and I wanted to eat, so this seemed like a logical choice.  It was a nice place to sit, and my server was pleasant. The food was mediocre at best; it took a relatively long time to come out, and it wasn't even hot, and not fresh; even the beans seemed canned.  Since this place is located at the airport, drinks are, as expected, pricy, so I didn't  order anything alcoholic, , as I might normally do...or stay for another round, as I might normally do. But if you have time to kill, and don't care about the food, it is a nice enough place."}
{"text":"Good tequila.   Lousy food.  Meats were microwaved.  Great conversation at the bar though!"}
{"text":"This bar has friendly service, good but slightly-overpriced tequila, and a good mix of usual and unusual mixed drinks.  It also has lots of seating, plenty of bar space, and just-dark-enough ambiance."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes before anyone would even acknowledge us.  Had to hunt someone down...then we were able to order drinks.  Pricey wine...didn't try the food."}
{"text":"Never again will I not check the reviews. My breakfast burying took 21 minutes as did everyone else's and there were 4 of us. Not exactly a crowd. At least twice us in staff. Spare yourself"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a layover and sat at the bar order flour tacos and rice.  I also had a margarita which cost more than my meal!  The bartender Pat kept getting on my nerves telling me to move over a little but to my right out my bag on floor etc... I was thinks if he would give me a second I would.  Anyhow the food wasn't that great and neither as the margarita."}
{"text":"Prices are INSANE. 4 margaritas chips and salsa. NO DINNER. the bill was $100.70. The drinks alone were $16 each. AVOID."}
{"text":"DO NOT get the tacos! The moment I picked them up, the entire tortilla just disintegrated and everything spilled out. I was at Sams club yesterday and the tortillas I sampled there were at least twice the quality. The ingredients we're decent quality for airport food, but i had soggy tortilla bits mixed in w/ them. Soggy tortilla. Not my fav topping."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the biggest rip off ever.  Came in from a long flight and was waiting to catch another flight so decided to have a \"lemon drop\" martini.  There were no prices listed on the drink menu but expected to pay under $10.  My sister got a class of the house wine.  I had 2 martini's and she had one class of wine.  When I got my bill I was surprised to see that I had been charged almost $15 per martini and $14 for a glass of wine.  I would have complained but didn't want to cause a scene as there were so many people.  I would NOT recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Holy Crap 14 bucks for a Mimosa?!? Breakfast at the Mexican place sounded way better than a greasy biscuit sandwich or Chili's.  I'm pretty sure everything was precooked but chorizo and eggs was halfway decent, they have Cholula sauce, and the mimosa is Korbel not crappy Cooks or something like that.  But those were yesterday's nasty dried up tortillas. Yuck.   The server was super friendly and just-right attentive.  And let's not forget that I'm in the airport, so this gets a 3-star pass."}
{"text":"First, airport food sucks and is overpriced.  The service here is attentive and friendly.  It's an airport.  The first priority is speed of service.  I understand it will not be a 5 star dining experience.  So a 4 is as good as it gets.  The Barbacoa nachos were edible and quick.  The beer came quick.  Server was nice.  Home run."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast,  was hungry and a 6 hour flight to look forward to,  so needed some quantity also.  Greeting was lukewarm,  server was cheerful and service just fine. Food was out in about 15 minutes and generous portion of huevos rancheros.  Potatoes were microwave version,  but taste was great on entire meal. I will be back when in CLT and want breakfast.  I ordered nothing from the bar, so can't comment.  Prices for food were about what you would pay outside the airport."}
{"text":"Food sucks, service sucks... The only thing this place got right was the decoration. I am mexican and I can tell you all the food this place serves is frozen and then re-cooked. Everything on the menu that has the word \"tortilla\" on it, is completely dreadful.   I don't have connections in Charlotte too often but I promise you all one thing: I'm never eating in this place again, and neither should you!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered three orders to go from their pronto /express section.......took them 30 minutes to finish the order, that's after few of customers in line complained about the verrrrrryyy slow service.....they should close down the express to go side."}
{"text":"place wasn't that good and obviously sense its in an airport they over charge for everything but when you are messed up and need some food it does the trick."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place many times as my company has a manufacturing hub in Charlotte, so over the years I have eaten here often as I wait for my departing flight. It's not bad Mexican, just a little pricey.   The reason for the one star review is that as I am completing my expense report realized someone added their own tip to my bill. My bill was $24.87, which I paid with my corporate card and left a $5 cash tip. As I am completing my expense report, what's shown as being charged to my CC card is $29.87, so clearly someone gave themselves another $5 tip on top of the cash I left. This is unacceptable and theft. Guess I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Salsa from a jar, refried beans from a can, stale and cold soft taco shells, and day old mahi-mahi chunks. Plus a beer and corn chowder all for $30."}
{"text":"Not pleased with this place at all. The waitress took our beer order and didn't even ask if we wanted a regular or large. My wife ordered tacos and once again wasn't asked what type of tortilla or sides she wanted. It came out as a huge soggy mess that you couldn't even pick up. The \"state mandated\" well done burger is a bunch of bull that changed years ago. The home fries that came with my ground beef hockey  puck where cold and there was no site of a chimichuri sauce to be found (unless the green mayo is their version of it.)"}
{"text":"Worst food ever.  Bought a sandwich running to my next flight.  Sandwich was made two days earlier and expired the day I bought it.  Yuck.  Who eats a two day old sandwich.  No taste and Old.  Threw it away and bought almonds on the flight instead."}
{"text":"That was the most vile, rancid airport food I've ever been served. One order was a veggie burrito with zero veggies, the other was meat that tasted rancid. Actually rancid. If I hadn't been rushing to catch a plane, I'd have gone back and asked them to taste it. All I can hope to do is fight the credit card charge ($25 for two cold, just disgusting burritos).   You people should be ashamed of yourselves. That was, without question, the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Take some fu#%ing pride in your work."}
{"text":"Service!  Where us the service! I have been here for 15 minutes without so much as a glass of water. You shouldn't tell people \"oh just sit anywhere\" and forget about them. It doesn't matter how your food taste if no one ever gets to order. I just watch three customers walk out and I'm right behind them..."}
{"text":"Nice service, but horrible food!  I was able to charge my electronics while dining, so that was very nice of the staff.  The waiter was friendly and chipper.   However, the nachos were disgusting, and tasted and appeared microwaved or left to heat up under a broiler.  It was gross!"}
{"text":"Facade looks nice but that was the best part. Chimichanga was like a frozen burrito from college. Not sure what the Margarita was made of but was not impressive either. I go through here several times a month and will not return for drinks or food."}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong tacos. I didn't send them back as I didn't really have time. The tacos were mediocre and the side of rice was very small. Margarita was OK."}
{"text":"The Tequileria \"Pronto\" was not pronto at all. Wasn't very busy and I still had to wait about 20 minutes for a burrito. Wasn't a good one either. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the most vile, gut-wrenching burrito I have ever had. The whole inside was pasty and drenched in oil. I feel sick just having finished it. Is it even possible to mess up a burrito so much?? Chipotle is like 100 times better."}
{"text":"No kids menu.  Menu is extremely limited and overpriced. Service was poor.  They know they have you trapped and make. No effort to accommodate."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. My burrito was cold, the tortilla was stale, and the filings insipid. And the serving plate seemed to have been chilled, not heated. The margarita was also quite pedestrian, just some tequila and mixer out of a bottle.   One additional star for the waiter that did not suck at his job."}
{"text":"I would have given it one star, but when the food finally came it wasn't half bad.  Is it just me, or if you were running a place in an airport, wouldn't you manage toward the fact that some if not all of your customers might have to catch a plane?  I guess that they assume everybody's flight is delayed and is grateful for the chance to kill time.  Not that the many TVs are well managed.  When there are a bunch of games on, why are almost all of them tuned to Florida-FSU?  You are in Charlotte for crying out loud.  The bad service contributes to the sketchy atmosphere."}
{"text":"When you go to an airport bar serving tex-mex, I think we all lower our expectations. However the staff here are extremely genuine and friendly. As an experienced person in the industry I have to say that Derrick and Victor made my 10 hour impromptu layover as worthwhile as it gets. Saddle up, have some drinks and act like your still on vacation. They WILL take care of you."}
{"text":"This place was great. Came in for some quesadillas and wine between flights around 1:00pm on a Tuesday. Bartender lady (Rebecca) was very friendly and quick. She had some rude customers but kept a pleasant, warm demeanor the whole time. I used to always go to the BBQ places at this airport but I think I'll come here instead next time."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst restaurants I've ever visited. Walked in and literally every free table was dirty. Only 3 servers working, no table bussers, no manager to be found, and one bartender. As we searched for a clean table many other people were as well. Many of them giving up and walking out. Right as we were leaving we found a mildly dirty table and decided to settle with that. Our server was extremely busy and forgot our drinks. I was understanding to this because I also work in the restaurant industry. What I am not understanding of is rude.  A few of our friends walked into the restaurant and were looking for a table. We called them over and invited them to sit with us because all of the other tables were dirty. Our server marches over to our table and literally says, \"Im wondering what you're talking about because I know there are not dirty tables in here, I have been cleaning them!\" WOW! How rude and completely unnecessary.  I guess between forgetting our drinks, not taking our order, and falling all over the place he wasn't able to take note of the many people leaving because they couldn't find a clean table.  In addition to the horrible service and sensitive/delusional staff the food is horrible. I got tacos. Tortillas so weak and cheap they fall apart when you lift them.  Do Taco Bell."}
{"text":"In a word - disgusting. Had to request new silverware because my initial set contained chunks (not bits, chunks) of crusted food. The tapwater had a strange metallic taste that not even fresh lime could mask. Final disappointment: North Carolina's recently updated laws that prohibit restaurants from serving undercooked meat. Had I known this before ordering, I would have ordered something else, but the server neglected to let me know. I was not pleased when the burger I requested \"medium-rare\" came out well-done and flavorless.  The sides are microscopic. For $1.99 you can get 2 tablespoons of \"guacamole\" (it definitely isn't the kind that's made of freshly mashed avocado).  Also, they'd ran out of mango for their margaritas by 12PM on a Sunday. That's unnacceptable, even at a high-traffic location like this.  Should've gone to Uno's."}
{"text":"Everything was bad,  for $60 we got 2 watered down margaritas,  buffalo wings that were supposed to be honey chipotle wings, and a burger that was as burnt as could be. The only  good about this place was the location and the waitress Amber.  Do yourself a favor and pick another restaurant, the airport have plenty to chose from"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad to go, and took it on the plane with me. It was decent, what you would expect for airport food, and the price was extremely high...which....well, again, it's airport food."}
{"text":"Ah yes, I get it. The reviews are fairly valid... but for one, this IS an airport restaurant so you automatically shouldn't expect what you normally would... and secondly, it doesn't really matter does it? When traveling we gotta eat something... so this place will likely be busy no matter what any of us say! lol I ordered the passion fruit Paloma, outside my norm as I'm usually more a beer, wine or vodka soda kind of girl, but I said  to myself \"what the hell! I have a 2 hour layover\" and went for a cocktail even though I knew this was probably not the place to have such an epiphany. Well I should've known despite the refreshing description sounding semi artisanal, that it wasn't going to be fresh squeezed juices or anything, silly me! However, despite the concentrate juices - the drink wasn't overly sweet! Thank goodness, because as the waitress walked away I immediately regretted ordering it fearing it would be sickly sweet - I hate super sweet cocktails!!! So it was a big plus that it was made well... and I could taste the alcohol! So yay! Hey, I actually feel a buzz right now!  Now for the food, I ordered the veggie quesadilla to uphold my flexitarian ways (avoiding meat but will still eat it when I deem the meal worthy of breaking my semi-commitment). The quesadilla was good! Totally something like what you could throw together at home, nothing mind blowing, but totally tasty and did the job. I like the veggie option because it was corn and beans, with just a little finely chopped bell pepper. I would totally get it again if i was at this terminal. So for that, given the setting and expectations, I'd say it's a 4 Star place as far as airport restaurants go!  Oh yes, the server was very friendly too!!! She was busy, but never was gone too long despite that fact, she got me everything I needed in an appropriate amount of time."}
{"text":"My teetotalling grandmother mixes a better \"top shelf margarita\" for $15. Yea it's an airport, but Jesus...I'm tryina get drunk. Avoid."}
{"text":"Honestly pretty fine for an airport restaurant. I was here around 9 am on a weekday and was in and out I'm about 45 minutes. Not the place to go if you've got a tight connection, but not unreasonable either. The waitress was pretty busy and definitely not hovering, but I could get her attention if I needed to (I didn't), and she was on the ball and polite.   I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were decent. Not groundbreaking, but I would have been pretty happy to eat this same meal at a local brunch place. The potato wedges were cooked, but soggy.   Overpriced, but it's the airport  For just my meal and a coffee, it was $19, including tip. Will I eat here again? Probably not. Would I? Sure."}
{"text":"I had the chopped salad to go on a quick layover. Lettuce was not fresh. It was supposed to come with corn, but didn't. It came smothered in dressing. Chicken was tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Food is edible. Wish they still had their crab cakes! Expensive but it's the airport.  Marci is the best! She's super fast and friendly and I will definitely be back if she's working!  People who come on here and write bad complaints about the staff are super bored with their lives. If you've never had an off day or bad day, then you are one lucky individual.  Dealing with the public isn't easy, esp in their Airport where everyone is in a hurry and thinks they are priority over the one next to them"}
{"text":"Not sure what the 2 star overall average was about....but I'll add my 5 star review.  Needed some breakfast before my flight, had the Huevos Y Chorizo with an OJ.  They were outstanding as well as the service.  I'll be back to try them again next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I would not eat here again.  I could've bought the nachos and salsa at half the price for twice the serving size at the grocery store.  Even the margaritas are not good.  And they served a pint glass. Why?  The tacos look good, but they are flavorless and bland at best. I'm irritated I wasted my money here."}
{"text":"Burger had no flavor, \"ed war doe\" at the bar was kind of rude to someone else and they left. Service was slow."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad marguerita. It's basically canned food. You can't expect excellent  food in an airport but this place is real bad. I was there a half hour ago and already can tell I will blow up the bathroom pretty soon."}
{"text":"Should have read the other reviews before dropping in. Service is terrible with food and drink hardly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Poor service, bad attitudes.  Shame on the manager here.  They should lead their team better.  I bet they are in an office somewhere because if they were out here, they would see.   Update: my bad, the computer is acting up.  According to the wait staff this place is 5 Star when the computer is working.  I wish the computer would come refill my glass and bring chips."}
{"text":"I wish there was a no star button I asked for a simple margarita and got charged for a double \"house margarita\" that tasted like s**t. Was not worth $16 I WAS CHARGED! My server didn't even offer to take it off and was no help at all! I would NOT recommend this place, I also ordered a chicken quesadilla it was bland AF, the only thing I enjoyed was it was piping hot out the kitchen. This place will Never get my business again. I am so pissed it's not even funny. $30 for shitty food and service sucked?! And sir I DID NOT ASK FOR DOUBLE SHITTY MARGARITA"}
{"text":"Not a bad place - especially for an airport.  Know that they'll always be crowded during peak travel times and usually understaffed so the bartenders especially will be running around like crazy and they're actually quite good yet people will still be complaining about service.  That being said, the house margaritas are very good - and large - and as far as airports go the price isn't too bad for a top shelf margarita that basically fills the glass twice.  On the food side, the crab cake sandwich was excellent with a fresh jicama slaw on top and I got it with chips & guacamole which were pretty good.  On a second visit I ordered tacos immediately upon sitting down which never came in the 45 minutes I was at the bar but it was a Thursday evening and the place was packed and the bartender took it off my bill so not a huge deal.  If I was starving I would have asked about it every 5 minutes but everyone was running around like crazy so I didn't bother them.  There are a few decent places in the central area of the Charlotte airport, but I would definitely come back here again and appreciate the large number of bar seats that are available.  Not perfect, but pretty good option for an airport restaurant & bar."}
{"text":"Airport food. Service was pretty good, drinks were overpriced (the house margarita is a double of top shelf?) and the food was extremely bland. Salsarito in the food court has much better Mexican food, but its take out only."}
{"text":"Chimichanga had a good flavor. Not the best Mexican food, but not too bad for a 3 hour layover. Music is a way too loud."}
{"text":"WOW. Worst service I have EVER experienced. And I don't write reviews, but I'm taking the time to write this one. The server came by got our drink order, came back with the drinks in a reasonable amount of time, but then took our food order and disappeared. 25 minutes later we caught the waiter walking by and asked him to check on our order. We were not rude, said sir and everything. He didn't even verbally respond, just looked at us. Then came back with my food but not my boyfriend's saying they were out of chips. He had ordered nachos. Really? When we were upset that he hadn't told us that and said the service sucked he got pissed at us. Again, really? You never check on us, you never check on the order and when you finally do it is because we asked you to. Didn't even get an apology. So YES, your service SUCKS. Don't even bother. Go to 1897 Market where we ended up going (left my entire meal untouched at the other restaurant) and they are awesome!! And yes we paid for two meals, you can guess who got a tip and who didn't."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Terrible service. $12 for a drink.  We sat there for what felt like 10 minutes before someone came to take our order.  Halfway through my meal, I asked a staffer for some extra salsa and she said she'd need a server to ring it up for me. Really? You're going to charge me for a tiny cup of salsa?  A server never did show up, and I finished the burrito with hot sauce instead.  We were served by three different people, and none of them were friendly, attentive, or prompt.  Especially at an airport, promptness is a must.  I didn't leave a tip because they didn't deserve one."}
{"text":"Bartender is not that friendly, and a restaurant in an airport with out any power outlet on the costumer side!! Smh The food was ok"}
{"text":"Placed sucked. I know airports are expensive but there is no reason for a soggy gross burrito. It looked like they put zero effort into the food and I would recommend finding elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Service needs to get on the ball! This is an airport damn-it, people are trying to get from terminal to terminal in a timely fashion. Chips are decent, salsa lacks passion... A change of music is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Situated at the hub between all the terminals.  Only good thing about this place.  Food was cold and bland, drinks are watery - better choices at CLT"}
{"text":"Sat down after finding a not so dirty table. Wiped the table down myself. Waited 10 minutes after alerting waiter for service. Waited 40 min and couldn't eat at the restaurant. Took the soggy quesadillas boxed to go. Sad!"}
{"text":"If I was able to give 0 stars I would. This place has thee WORST customer service EVER and may I add there are servers/server  that are quite prejudice.  Throughout my business travel in & out of CLT weekly for the past two years I much rather grab food at any other restaurant prior to arriving at CLT as the selection is crap & once you think you see a great place such as this one, you are in for a terrible surprise. I ate here twice the only reason I went the 2nd time is because management contacted me after I complained & left my business card & I was left assured that this wasn't the type of service that the restaurant was built on (my terrible prejudice experience).  Low & Behold let me explain my 2nd visit, it went a lil something like this: I entered the restaurant & because it's seat yourself I found a cozy seat on the back wall where tables to my left & right were empty. I begin to sip my FiJi (water already on the tables for purchase) & watched servers go around & around on this very unbusy day & not one checking on me or acknowledging me. I began to think I sat in a bogus section & proceeded to pack my things up to move until two groups of ppl walked in & sat at the tables next to me. As quick as they sat someone was there to serve them & greet them which prompted me to ask if there was a different server for the middle table? I was again ignored & then that was followed by the waitress asking \"is there anything I cab get you\" I replied \"definitely I would like proper customer service as the other guest who are not of my race are receiving\" she rolled her eyes up into her thin blonde head & said \"would you like something to drink\"? I smiled, declined & exited the restaurant to NEVER return again in LIFE not even if I'm stuck in CLT & starving as the food wasn't that tasty anyhow (I ate my 1st visit & only returned because of my phone call from the manager & the good margarita I had)."}
{"text":"The establishment looks appealing not to mention the nice atmosphere. However, the food is bland. We order a variety of items of which there was nothing special about any of it. The drinks are subpar. And the staff are nonchalant."}
{"text":"Really just tasteless, and the blaring Mexican music is chosen by a poor DJ. I regret eating here and there are better choices in the Charlotte airport.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place service was absolutely horrible all the wait staff were angry acting and slow. The didn't act normal till they brought the check. I also bought question addition to the salsa and they wanted to charge me more for another basket of chips. Typical airport robbery.... With an extra twist of you suck."}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant serving breakfast!!!! Cold potato, cold bacon, tasteless scrambled eggs and salad. Oh and the worst luke warm stale coffee. Maybe the fare is better for later meals but give breakfast a miss"}
{"text":"Waiter Pat was great but the queso was awful. Came out and was just like a slab of melted cheese and then re hardened with a ton of grease. It was impossible to eat with my chips so I just ate the tiny cup of salsa I was given. The guy next to me had nachos with chicken and black beans that looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Not my favorite airport restaurant in the world,  but they're located right at the head of Term C so they are always right snack in my path.  Service can be sketchy,  the food reasonable quality - but the pricing is on the high end of airport pricing - and the beverage selections are pretty limited.  Use it for what it is but just don't expect to much."}
{"text":"I get that restaurants don't have to post drink prices, but to charge $15 for a tiny, weak, insipid margarita was a bit over the top. My lunch was interesting, though not really Mexican. My chicken tasted like it had a sweet barbecue sauce on it.  Service was okay. I was glad my waitress didn't ask me how my meal was after I watched her uncomfortable reaction to another customer's dislike of his meal. She tried to find something he liked to talk about, while offering no discount.   There are some really good eateries in CLT. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken the time to read reviews before deciding on this place purely to avoid the main food court. It deserves no more than 1 star. Service is SLOW, and I didn't think it was possible to have tasteless Tex-Mex, but this proves it's quite possible. I've tried adding salt, hot sauce...basically anything on the table that might help me scarf this crap down (I'm really hungry)...I don't believe there's any helping it. It's getting scooted aside & I'll be anxiously awaiting the airplane pretzels.    (I ordered the pork chimichanga)....and I may as well have thrown $20 to the wind."}
{"text":"Every bit worth 2 stars. The service is impersonal and uncaring. For the quality and taste of food, the prices are high.   I've been flying through CLT for years and had never tried this place. My visit today will be my last ever.   The one tasty plate/dish?: chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Don't go here! Waited 20 minutes for quesadillas. Wanted cheese only for my 4 year old, they refused and said they could only do meat in the quesadillas. Then they proceeded to tell me that I was waiting so long because the food is made fresh to order which is fine, but then why can't you make my quesadillas cheese only? I paid for extra salsa that they insisted was in the box. I looked, didn't see it, informed them and they told me it was. I was too irritated over the wait, so I just left. Thanks for the bland nachos and subpar chicken quesadillas. To add insult to injury, the manager kept coming to the to-go counter, but not addressing a single problem. Useless."}
{"text":"Expensive The biggest issue is the price. I get that it's an airport ...But seriously $15 for a margarita is excessive. I should have realized this when there were no drink prices listed in the menu.  That felt shady.   They charge for the chips and salsa.... But at least it was a big plate of chips and a big bowl of salsa. Salsa was good,  had some kick. Jason was the server .  He was adequate."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on my way through Charlotte international airport. I usually stop at the Chili's Too which is just a few steps away, but wanted to try something new.   The service was quick and friendly, but beyond that there was very little else that was good. I ordered the Mexican Chopped Salad with Grilled Chicken. It was basically a pile of very old, wilted,  turning-brown lettuce with a bland, unappetizing-in-appearance chicken breast on top.  I asked for Ranch dressing instead of the creamy tomato dressing that comes standard with this salad, and got two to-go packets of Ken's Steakhouse Lite Ranch (which, now having tried, I do NOT recommend). Beverage was unsweetened iced tea with lemon-just on the ok side of stale.  I am very picky about the freshness of my iced tea.  Atmosphere was crowded and loud.  Check came back wrong, and it took a manager to come fix it which they did quickly and cheerfully.   But sadly an overall below average lunch. I won't be back. :("}
{"text":"This is my new favorite eatery at CLT. I had chicken enchiladas and a margarita, both were outstanding. Reasonably priced for an airport property, and the service was quick. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been sitting here for 15 minutes. Not one person asked to help or take my order. Should have looked at Yelp before wasting my time. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"Outrageous prices for mediocre at best food. Wish I had looked at ratings first. Sodas were $3.29. Burger was $12.99. Burger King would have been better."}
{"text":"One star, only because 0 stars is not an option. This place made me sick. I was doubled over before walking out. You've been warned........"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst fucking food ever. Do not eat here or your asshole will turn inside out and explode on the plane."}
{"text":"Worst service! Ordered soup in the togo area and it took over 25 mins.. Never go here"}
{"text":"The food truly stinks! I keep trying different dishes hoping to find something worth eating during my layovers in Charlotte. I love Mexican food that much. When one has lived in Chicago (Rick Bayless -Frontera Grill), Colorado and California - one knows when Mexican food is awful. This is awful. Wake up North Carolina. Don't accept this crap."}
{"text":"Great for first thing in the morning beer while you wait for your flight.  I didn't have any food but enjoyed the ambiance and the conversation with other patrons and bar tender"}
{"text":"Came here despite the awful reviews. I was very worried so we played it safe, avoiding the overpriced margs and sticking with water. We got the chips and salsa (nothing special on the salsa) but I will say the chips were quite greasy. The queso was very basic, decent. I wanted to avoid meat here so we just got a cheese quesadilla, which was fine but took forever to come out (even though it's literally just cheese and a tortilla). Overall I would not eat here again and the food did give me bad heartburn just from how greasy everything was. I am an avid Mexican food fan and nothing here was even spicy, so I knew my stomach ache was due to the grease factor."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and order was incorrect.  Food was bland. Waitress was very good however"}
{"text":"Basically, it's Taco Bell with more comfortable seating, TVs and liquor. This is an airport, therefore expectations are way lower. Still, this \"airport scale\" of one star (which would be negative in the outside world) is fitting."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of stopping here between flights on 2/19/2016. Ordered without looking at the prices, which was my second mistake. It was $15 and some change for the \"taco salad\", which ended up being some pieces of lettuce with a couple beans, couple charred bits of corn, and faux chicken (the gross kind made of a bunch of protein extracts and whatnot) which was gummy. The dressing was okay, and made me slightly less mad, but I honestly wish I had chosen any of the fast food stops (Burger King, Auntie Anne's, Quiznos etc are all right across from this place) in the food court -- which is saying something.   Employees were too busy joking around with each other to take my order for a few minutes. The kitchen also did not look clean (you can see parts through the order window).   Avoid!"}
{"text":"Blah.  A good location for people watching and decent beer selection, but the service can be apathetic and slow."}
{"text":"Fair to poor, even allowing for airport location. \"Jumbo\" shrimp were anything but. Skirt steak was over cooked and 1/4\" thick.  Basic Margarita is $14.00 (not indicated on menu). Service slow. My advice:  Pick an alternative."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the 2 star rating honestly. This place is much superior to most airport restaurants I've been to. Of course it's a little pricey, but to be expected, and they actually offer to make your drink a double for a discount, which I've never seen in an airport restaurant. I had some fantastic nachos here, I highly recommend them. Service was nothing special."}
{"text":"Tequila Jose Cuervo gold was def watered down .. Was even white in color, had the same in the the stock car cafe huge difference.."}
{"text":"Very disappointed 2nd time at this restaurant and there's only 1 server for 30 people in my area all the food taste sweet and not authentic.  I will never come here again! Get more staff and improper your menu.  I got the chicken tortilla and chicken enchilada"}
{"text":"Big Space, Fast Service and AMAZING House Margarita with a souvenir shaker. Loud place but better than eating a burger good food. I like the tacos and felt the quality of food was good. But the perfect place for a margarita keep in mind this is a place for Tequila so not a huge beer selection but the perfect place to stop by for lunch or dinner if you find yourself with a layover."}
{"text":"$12, 1 oz shots? No fucking thank you.   Especially after this heartwarming encounter:     The bartender - a young woman with extensive tattoos on her arms and short black and blonde ponytails - picked a fight with a customer who's server had forgotten him and his wife in the back of the restaurant.   Mr Customer tried to politely ask for his check, explaining the situation and the bartender defiantly stated that she could not help him and that he needed to pay at his table where his server had forgotten them for some time.  Mr customer very patiently restated his quandary after which he bartender, without a word, stormed off into the back of the restaurant. Upon returning; she didn't even look at mr customer and proceeded to go take a drink order from another customer at the bar (this all happened on 11/29/2014 between 515pm -530pm).  Mr customer ended up getting his bill and signing from some other employee at the bar.  My experience was fine until the check was requested with one last beer. The Same bartender as above sat laughing with another bartender, preparing several other drinks in glasses, and doing something else right in front of me for about five minutes before she finally remembered to crack a top off a beer put it in front of me and hit a button that printed my receipt all in under 10 seconds.   Way to go to pay attention to your customers."}
{"text":"Disappointing food only over shadowed by poor service.   While it seems impossible, the service was worse than the uninspired food."}
{"text":"Good, quick airport food. Nothing special, but does the trick. Service is super fast so if you have a flight to make, they will serve you on time. Also, plenty of TVs to watch sports games. The chicken with any meal is always good."}
{"text":"Quick To-go service is not so \"Pronto.\"    Tequileria is located right in the center of all concourses at Charlotte Airport while you are crossing over gates to catch your next flight, you will not miss it in the corner.  Had the Jicama Salad that sounded SOOoooOOOoo very good in the description, I had to have it to-go on my flight home.  Firstly, the salad took forever...Almost twenty minutes in the \"Quick To-Go\" area dubbed as \"Pronto\" service.    The only thing that I asked for extra is for them to add grilled chicken to the salad.    Once I got to the gate, I was expecting this crisp and refreshing Jicama and nice luscious lettuce blend with some tomatoes and cheese.  But instead, I found myself some shredded iceberg lettuce that looks like its used to top their tacos and several strips of Jicama and some diced tomatoes and shredded cheese.  That is it!  So very bland and the chicken was paper thin to say the very least.  BleAahhHHh...  On top of that, I got to my gate and realized there wasn't even dressing in the bag...so I sucked it up and just ate it because I already bought it and was hungry and there was no turning back to get dressing (which in the description, it was tossed in).    Uhhh...Never again...BLeaHhHhh..."}
{"text":"Want to eat and catch your plane? Don't eat here. Basic failure in airport food service. waited 30 mins for a cheese quesadilla before I walked out. Only about half full so don't let that fool you into thinking you can get a quick bite.  Now I get no breakfast and board a 6 hour flight."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Specifically ordered two \"basic\" margaritas, they charged us for the \"ultimate\" margarita which is $16 a piece, btw. Either way it was undrinkable after one sip. The queso was like an old soup and the salsa was the only thing edible- probably because it was store bought. A good $44 for having a couple bites of salsa basically. Horrible service, horrible experience."}
{"text":"I usually don't review food and drink places at airports because it's common knowledge that airport prices are always jacked up for a mediocre return. However, this is a deserving post.  I walked in and picked a table on my own at 1:30pm on a Monday, and the restaurant was only half-full. It took a few minutes for a waitress to arrive, which is typical for every restaurant I've visited in an airport. I also took a spot in the far back for privacy. This place has a huge section upfront with the bar, but also a quieter section in the back.  This experience was unique from my past travels because my waitress, Cassie, worked hard and fast for me. I wasn't even in a hurry, and she was running around attending to everyone as quickly as possible, but not rushing anyone. You could tell it was her mission to make everyone happy and she kept a friendly smile and attitude the entire time. Usually you have to flag people down at airports, but she stayed on top of things and I never had to wait longer than expected. You can bet she received an extra large tip. She made me feel like she was my personal assistant and said I could stay as long as needed.  I ordered the chips and salsa, which were $4.99, and the salsa was good. My chips came out hot from the oven, which is rare, but awesome! It's annoying to pay for chips and salsa, but I guess they don't want people sitting there eating free chips and salsa and not ordering anything else. Maybe make it free chips and salsa if you order a meal?  I also ordered the chopped taco salad. It was nothing special, I was just craving Mexican food. It didn't taste like a Mexican taco salad, but the chips and salsa healed my craving.   I didn't order alcohol since I was recovering from the weekend visiting friends, but drank 3 glasses of water that never went empty before refilled!  If you are craving Mexican food, give it a try. It's the only sit-down Mexican restaurant I saw between B and C terminals plus it was nice to sit in a comfy booth versus the gate during a layover. I wouldn't visit this place if it was a restaurant outside of the airport, but it's ok for airport food. The other reviews made me laugh because, again, airports always have higher prices on goods which are usually average at best. Set your expectations accordingly. If this restaurant was located outside of the airport, the review would have been totally different. Normal restaurants versus airport restaurants have different expectations, use common sense. :)"}
{"text":"The bartender Stefanie was great, her suggestion for the crabcakes (spicy mayo on the side), with black beans and rice and top shelf margaritas (more sweet than sour) were on point!  Food & drinks were delicious!  The folks at the bar offered great conversation while I waited for my next flight.  If I have a layover in CLT again, I will be back at Tequileria's bar again."}
{"text":"Simply put - you're stuck at the airport - so they \"got ya\". Crappy food, so-so drink and poor service. Good luck if this is your choice. Go get Burger King before you choose this."}
{"text":"Bring an umbrella.   To start off, I had to make a yelp account just to post this. That's how bad it is. I sit down on a three hour layover. I'm greeted fairly quickly by a gentleman who seemed pretty new to being wait staff. I tell him I'll have a beer and start off, implying I'll continue my order, with a order of chips and queso. About 5-10 minutes later he brings out the couple next to me two margaritas in shaker cups. He begins shaking and on an up swing he cannot keep a grip on it and showers me and everything within a ten foot radius of me with overpriced tequila. He then looks dumbfounded and starts blaming the bartender and apologizing to the couple. They had to bring attention to the fact that I was drenched. He then proceeded to give me a quick \"Sorry man\" before continuing on. No sort of compensation was made, not even so much as an offer for a free beer or anything. ALSO NO EXTRA TOWELS OR NAPKINS. It took another thirty minutes till I finally told him I wanted to place an order of an actual meal. The burrito sucked. Gas station burrito quality. After everything I couldn't bring myself not to tip. I left a ten percent tip and proceeded to report this to the manager on duty who seemed more apathetic than anyone else. If I'm ever unfortunate enough to be stuck in CLT for three hours again I will call an uber to a chipotle outside the airport.   The queso was good though."}
{"text":"It's bland mexican food at the airport.  It serves a purpose which is to soak up alcohol.  I have taken coworkers here...not sure why when Phillips is more their speed, but it hits the spot when I have time to kill before my flight and want some tacos."}
{"text":"$33 for two crumbly soft tacos filled with rice and beans, a tablespoon of guacamole, and a Jose cuervo margarita. If you ever go to a tequileria that only serves Jose Cuervo, just get up and leave. The rest of the menu is probably awful too."}
{"text":"A few times I've stopped in here during long layovers for a heartier meal.  The loaded nachos are delish.  Atmosphere is nice, and I was able to plug in. Bit pricey... more or less what you would expect to pay for an airport meal.   Good spot for layover food in the Charlotte Airport."}
{"text":"I wish I went to big daddy's or Brooklyn farms during my layover.   Food was horrible but at least the service  was good. We had the tacos and crab cakes per the recommendation of our server. Don't have the crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Had a long stopover at the Charlotte airport and decided to give Tequileria a try - I've seen them in many airports before and was wondering what the experience will be.  Somehow in my mind I was expecting the experience similar to Vino Volo, only with tequila tasting flights instead of wine. That was not the case - this is a regular Mexican restaurant with slightly extended tequila list, mostly Jose Cuervo ( I ended up drinking Corona).  Food was good - had chicken gumbo soup and chimichurri burger. I would've like more chimichurri sauce on my burger, but that would be the only complaint. Little side of chopped jalapeno/tomato/sweet onion mix was outright delicious (had to ask for a second).  Service was prompt and friendly.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great service.  Generally agree with other reviewers that the food is just meh. Of course, at an airport this is not unheard of. Basically a food factory... Had to write this review and at least add a star above average for great service. Looking around, it appears that being a server in a volume airport restaurant must be tough. Noisy, crowded, and nonstop busy. Yet my server, Annabelle, took the time to make it personal and ensure that my meal was presented the best it could be. Muchos Gracias  Annabelle!"}
{"text":"overpriced waste of time.  ordered the veggie tacos: and paid $11 for salsa in tortilla shells.  total joke.  do NOT recommend.   service was practically non-existent."}
{"text":"Not mexican food at all just a bad imitation the only good thing was the cheese dip and the waiter"}
{"text":"No acknowledgement when I came in or sat down.  Beans watered down and spiced up with chili sauce. My fish taco just tastes like fish sticks with mayo on them. Not impressed at all.  At least the beer was good.  For $13.99 two fish sticks. You think I would have gotten chips and salsa. Nope."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, like Tijuana nightclub dirty but in an airport in North Carolina that closes in the late evening... I don't get it. The margarita was ok, wouldn't drink two. The bar makes them in advance and sits them in shakers ready to add ice and go, so lazy and not my preference. They claimed the beef enchiladas were good, they were flour tortillas with almost tasteless shredded beef ala pot roast with some cotixa on lettuce topping. Save yourself the visit. I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Ok already! It's not \"authentic\" Mexican! Are you really expecting a Rick Bayliss quality restaurant in an airport? I sure am not. This place provided me with a DECENT breakfast/lunch and friendly service. Not cheap like any other airport establishment but it did the job. I left full and satisfied. Ok so it's not even Mexican. Just call it EL DECENTO AEROPORTO foodo."}
{"text":"Dirty. Slow/ non-existent service. Waited 15 minutes for waiter and another 20 for food. Had to leave to board flight without eating. One and done."}
{"text":"STAY SO SO SO FAR AWAY  Damn I wish I had read the reviews before eating here.  Paid $16 for a short and disgusting drink called the Maestro. (Price was not listed on the menu.)  Paid another $16 for 3 bland tacos with prechopped iceberg lettuce and pregrated cheese.   Service was poor, was not served water, was not able to pick different fillings for my 3 tacos, and so ridiculously overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly overpriced and INCREDIBLY slow. There was nobody else at the Pronto line and it took nearly 30 min for our breakfast burrito. You can watch them in the kitchen as you stand there waiting and it's mind blowing how slow they are. We paid $15 for a very gross breakfast burrito and soggy potatoes. Don't go here."}
{"text":"This place is \"Bandolero!\" approved!  There are basically 3 things that you can do when you get delayed or have a long layover at CLT:  meander hours away on a white rocking chair pretending you are whittling a flute for your great-grand kids, be snooty at the wine bar, or get sloshed at the Jose Cuervo Tequileria.  I have always done the latter, to either get the party started or cure a wicked hangover.    I'm a bit disappointed in the ratings this place was given.    Is it over-priced?  Well yea, but you're in an airport. It's not \"authentic Mexican.\"  Well yea, but you're in an airport. It's not \"authentic Mexican, part b.\"  You're in an airport... in North Carolina. Super slow service.  Well yea, but I'd rather be drunk here than at the DMV. Food was bland.  Well yea, but it's called salt, babe.  The waitress couldn't hear me.  Well yea, but she listens to jets take off all day.  All in all, I've had some great memories here.  The staff has always been super friendly, and when I get stranded here at off-times (yea, I've had a flight delayed at 2pm on a Tuesday), the staff will have a full on conversation with you if you're the only one in there, about tattoos, booze preferences, and what not to order from the menu.  The way I see it, you're gonna be stuck here, might as well make the most of it.    Plus, who doesn't want to stare at Raquel Welch for a few hours?"}
{"text":"It's actually pretty good. But it's frustrating. Here's the story: I ordered a flash quick to-go meal so I could eat and run to catch my connection. Yeah right. Of course it took a million years to finally get my meal. After 15 minutes the server ran back to the kitchen and told them they had to prepare my food hay es hay p. I guess they totally forgot my order. I got it and ran. well, after running with my to-go box the pollo enchiladas, rice and beans ended up sloshing everyone and dripped all over my bag. Nice. Too bad it was such a crummy experience. Because the pollo was well seasoned and tasty. The beans had serious spice and zip to them. The rice was tasteless but has a hint of cilantro a la chipotle style. Most people complain about the charge for chips and salsa. The server tells me its because it's all made in house. Well, I believe it. the food here tastes good. And the dining room is always packed. Just cannot rely on the kitchen. In the airport I really need a more reliable food spot. Grr."}
{"text":"Hopefully my review brings it down to one star like it should be. the food was frozen and absolutely terrible. the service was just as bad. I let the manager know that the food was bad and he said I'm sorry to hear that and that was it. There's a ton of different options don't choose this one!!"}
{"text":"Walked by this place many times ... usually not enough time between flights ... but gave it a try.  You seat yourself so take look a around to grab a table as it can get busy during meal times. As I'm sitting here, I check my trusty goto friend - yelp!  Needless to say, based on the ratings my hopes were not high.  I tried the corn tortilla soup and chicken taco salad.   Both were decent.  The service was friendly.    If you are in a hurry - don't stop, but if you have some extra time - I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Please don't come here and expect top notch tex-mex or Mexican food; like the 2-star count says, 'meh, I've experienced better'. If you've got time to sit down while you're at the airport and you need a quick Mexican fix, this place will do in a pinch but the food isn't worth calling home about. Service, food and drinks get the job done, but none are over-achievers."}
{"text":"Do good airport restaurants actually exist? I feel like it's a ruse to have outfittings like this. There is a strange feeling of solice despite it being packed. Every patron is sitting at a two chaired table by themselves and knows they are getting shafted with this meal. Prices are extremely high, service is a joke, and the food quality is meh.  Fast food has managed to figure out airports to an acceptable level. These mini restaurants have advantage of operating in this cage of hungry travelers and managed to create a minimally viable service."}
{"text":"I'm usually at this airport for connections that are long enough for a meal, but too short for a sit-down restaurant. This is my go-to for breakfast.   I order the crab cake and eggs (comes with potatoes) for $12.99. It's actually a great quality crab cake with only a little filler, topped with pico de gallo and served on a bed of lettuce. The eggs come scrambled with some cheese crumbles on top and they also give you a side of salsa. It's pretty filling and not too pricey considering it's a crab cake at airport prices.   They always tell me it will be about 12-14 minutes for it to be ready, but it definitely comes out faster than that."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and are sad to say it has consistently gone downhill over the years. Because of it's location, we've endured its lackluster service, but this past visit is the straw that broke the camel's back.  Empty glasses and half-filled plates littered the length of the bar and the abundance of fruit flies almost drove us away before we ordered, but we decided to stick it out as it has been our go-to in CLT.  We now wish we had gone somewhere else.  The kitchen got my wife's salad order wrong twice (she was a trooper and decided to eat around the unwanted ingredients because we were short on time and didn't want to wait for a third re-make) and it took us flagging Pat (our bartender) down for every drink to stay quenched.   We overheard a couple of servers talking about how they were perpetually understaffed and while we understand that, we've been to enough airports, bars, and restaurants around the world to believe that should never reflect in the service the guests experience.  Bottom line, we're headed back through CLT next week and will be drinking/eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during flight back to Seattle. Had chips, salsa and diet coke. Server was very nice and prompt. Salsa was watery but chips were hot. It's inside the airport so I did not expect much. $10 bucks for what I had. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Does this look like 3 Barbacoa tacos with lettuce and crema to you?? I paid almost $20 for this..took 15 minutes to get my order after staff said it would be 5-7 minutes. I had to run to my flight only to see my order was wrong! Also Barbacoa is not Mexican style... very bad experience! Hungry and upset!"}
{"text":"The food here is just terrible. The slow service makes this place a \"do not visit\"."}
{"text":"Worst mexican food I've ever eaten greasy and without flavor. Even the cheese was unpleasant and I didn't think that was possible."}
{"text":"Not worth it!! My margarita was syrup over ice, just save yourself and go else where. The server was nice but the food was awful. We had the guacamole which was bland, a pork chimichanga which was far from flavorful or crunchy and a chicken enchilada which was also bland. The rice was crunchy. The beans were weak. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken enchiladas were amazing! We also got some chips queso/salsa! All equally good! The beer on tap was cold and served in a very large glass. Very good experience!"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the food is actually ok.  The service however is horrendous.  I sat at the bar and waited about 10-15 minutes for someone to even show up. I even asked someone next to me if there was anyone working up there.  Then I ordered my food and drinks.  As I went to pour some more of the ultimate margarita in my glass I saw a bug was in my drink. I am not even exaggerating when I tried to get the bartenders attention for about 10 minutes and practically had to yell across the room \"Excuse me!\" only for her to completely ignore me.  Then I tried again for her attention and she just looked at me and then turned away again.  It was so bad that when she finally came over I actually just asked her why she was being so rude.  Go somewhere else, especially if you are in a hurry between flights."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican with worse service in CLT airport. Surly service at the bar and slop food. Waited forever for my food at the bar, asked for it to go and got the wrong order. Pork quesadilla - I don't even eat meat. Beware!! Should have known better than order food in hate state NC!"}
{"text":"Lots of good food and drink options on a quick stopover! Good prices and friendly bar staff. On my list to stop through when I come through next time."}
{"text":"I'd say sub-par / three stars would've been generous - the meat tasted good... But in pretty sure that it made me sick about 30mins later. The tacos were soggy / and there was excessive amounts of fat in the meat.   The service was mediocre, I guess you can't expect too much from an airport stop / but, this wasn't somewhere I'd choose again.  Perhaps find somewhere with more standard food, if you have a sensitive stomach."}
{"text":"Beef tacos are not what you expect.  Instead of spicy ground beef in crunchy hot curved tortillas, these are basically dry Carolina barbeque beef in a soft corn tortilla which falls apart after the first bite.  So, then you have salad with no wrapper which you have to eat with a fork.  House margaritas taste like Gatorade and there are no free chips and salsa (which I don't mind paying for; but, when you eat alone a big $5 bowl of chips and salsa makes no sense).  Lesson learned - connect through DFW if you want some real tacos."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary had barely any alcohol, very disappointing considering the price.. The guac and salsa were fantastic though!"}
{"text":"Airport food is what it is but a 50 min wait to get order with no heads up on long wait. Manager acted annoyed that we asked to speak with her and then made a snide comment that our conversation was inconveniencing her.  Server offered free app, but never brought it. We asked for food boxes, came out on plates and had to go back to be boxed. Overall crappy experience."}
{"text":"The two tacos plate was surprisingly decent-tasting; the meat (one barbacoa, one carnitas) was plentiful and seemed to be of good quality. The unimpressive side of guacomole for $1.95 was probably not worth it. Fast and attentive service. All in all, not bad for airport food."}
{"text":"My husband and I were quite surprised to find good margaritas and nachos in the CLT airport. While the nachos were non traditional with shredded/blended chicken and the margaritas were pricy, they were delicious. We ordered two of the nachos because the first was not enough to fill us up for our flight. The margaritas were seemingly endless and left us feeling tipsy before our flight. We will be back because CLT is becoming our new home-base airport!"}
{"text":"SO TERRIBLE!! Ugh I got the tacos which were way too expensive and cold. The corn tortillas were cold and broke apart before I could even get 1 bite. Sooo pissed I spent $20 on tacos and water. WTH"}
{"text":"Despite extravagant airport prices, the beer is good and so is the food. There are few places you can find Negra Modelo on tap, and this is one of them. Also had the nachos. They were okay. Too much salsa made too many of the chips soggy, but...it's nachos. Sposed to be a mess."}
{"text":"Don't, just don't.  Warmed over (barely) and stale Mexican fare at astonishingly high prices, with a side of horrible service.  I've walked past this restaurant on trips between concourses C and D in the Charlotte Douglas Airport and thought, \"next time.\" Now I've stopped there and will now think, \"never again.\"  Expectations for airport restaurants are pretty low; Tequileria lowers the bar another notch."}
{"text":"First and foremost, its not Cali-Mex (which I like), its Tex-Mex (which I don't). I wish I could read that first in reviews.   Tacos were dry but totally edible if you are starving. Had the Mahi-Mahi and they were not fishy.  Pork was also dry but tasty.  Guacamole tastes like it came out of a tube and if you order \"chips and guac\", you get a giant bowl of chips, lots of salsa and a tiny cup of guac.   Bartenders are very pleasant and the fresh margarita was good.  A little pricey.  But I'm stuck  in an airport and it beats Burger King."}
{"text":"The place was not busy.  The food was good. But, the service was slow. And, the staff seemed not to want to answer any questions. No prices on the menu for margaritas but the \"one grade up from house tequila\" cost $16.   As my wife said \"good food for an airport\""}
{"text":"For the love of everything sacred to you, like your taste buds, run as far away as you can. Go to burger King, or wait for the over price flight food...just don't eat here. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and it was horrifying the after taste was so bad I dry heaved (and I'm not being dramatic here). The wait staff was nice, and the drinks were good. If you plan on eating though, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"The vegan tacos are a nice option, but beware of the alcohol prices. $15.99 for a run of the mill mimosa is excessive even by NYC standards let alone a North Carolina airport. I'd eat here again, but drink elsewhere!! As a courtesy, given the outrageous price, a gentle warning upon ordering would have been appreciated. Thank goodness I passed on ordering another!"}
{"text":"Shitty food and long wait times. 20 minutes for a tiny burger smothered in layers and layers of nasty soggy iceberg lettuce? Ew... $20 down... Damn"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Fairly large portions. The service was great; I never had an empty glass. The queso dip isn't all that good; it's kind of gritty.  We ordered fish tacos and they were very good. Food was warm when it came out and the bean dip/rice was a nice combination. Left filled and would certainly recommend this place if you're looking for some decent airport mexican food. Just be prepared to pay a lot for the food; but then again it's going to cost you your first-born child to eat any food in an airport anyways."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I am a sucker for good Mexican food.  But at an airport?  Come on.  We intended to stop for drinks and chips and salsa, but went with the chips and guacamole, which were fantastic.  The drinks were tasty and decent strength.  The guacamole was so good we moved on to Tacos - and the tacos were tasty.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the whole micro-meal and cocktails.  This was a fantastic way to spend a layover at Charlotte, NC airport."}
{"text":"I know it's the airport,  but margarita start at $16.  Cheese dip $10.   Toooooo. Muchhhhhhh............................."}
{"text":"Went there today during a layover.  I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and chicken quesadillas. Both were mediocre.  What prompts my one star is the fruit flies at the bar.  I was sitting at the bar and I saw 3-4 fruit flies at any given time.  Okay I understand things happen at the bar.  However, one of the bartenders then came over and placed something down under the tap and all of a sudden I saw a surge of 20-30 fruit flies fly up and I couldn't eat anything after that.  Flashbacks of every episode of Bar Rescue was flying through my head and I just wondered what their kitchen looked like in hiding if that's how dirty their bar was in public.  I won't be returning there during my travels."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly great find in the Charlotte airport. The margaritas really surprised me in how good (and strong!) they were. They're not cheap at $12 - $13 but they definitely satisfied my craving for a fruity margarita. And the cheese quesadilla I had was pretty good as well. Not a life changer but made my layover significantly better."}
{"text":"Always good can be a bit slow especially if your in a rush but definitely the best sit down spot the airport has to offer. Always go with the black bean soup."}
{"text":"I can't believe I ordered a burger at a Mexican restaurant... what was I thinking. It was nothing special, but that's what I get and won't do that again. My Coworker got a Chimichanga and he loved it. Just wish they had free chips and salsa, I hate it when that's not included, especially at airport prices. The restaurant was super busy, crowded with bags and kids every where. But when I have time I'd much rather sit down for a meal than get fast food at an airport. I'll try it again next time I'm passing through."}
{"text":"Quite literally the worst service I've ever had, if you can count taking our order and disappearing as \"service.\" We sat for 20 minutes for water to arrive while waiters piled up dishes on tables, wait stations, and any other surface they could find that was not a dishwasher. When we told our server we were leaving he was completely unapologetic. Do yourself a favor and do not come here."}
{"text":"Our nachos came out quick and when I tell you they were good - they were good and different! No need to ask for extra cheese or chicken, it was adequately covered in every bite! We didn't get the onions, but we left everything else on it! Priced at $12.99, they were enough for us to share. My only complaint is with the State of NC - NO LIQUOR UNTIL 12 on Sunday - so I couldn't get that Bloody Mary I was craving!"}
{"text":"Food ok. Marci the bartender is an absolute nightmare. Demanded I move a stool to cram more people in. Please train Marci.. or keep her away from the front."}
{"text":"It's so expensive for what it is. The chimichanga tasted frozen and reheated. Chips and salad was $6. Honestly you're better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awful food.  Just reprehensible. I feel disgusting and terrible about my life now that I ate that over salted,  processed cheese injected, and questionable \"meat\" meal.  Service - nice but painfully slow,  especially for an airport.    The WORST \"Mexican\" food I've ever thrown down my gullate."}
{"text":"The salad was smeared in dressing and the lettuce was soggy.... So gross for a $14 salad. The tortilla soup was good."}
{"text":"Small portions for price. Bowl of soup less than 3/4 full. Service is slow. Atmosphere is airport so there is not much of it. There are better choices in the airport but the place is convenient when moving through terminals."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of the air hostesses via to our stop off in Charlestown SC Airport on the way to Costa Rica This place has a lot of beautiful mexican, TexMex decor. It was a go to place as soon as well landed, however the service was quite slow, and the food was not exactly what I had intended.  Chorizo sausage breakfast 2/5  I was expecting an actual chorizo sausage with my eggs, but rather it was all cut up and mixed with onions, and other spices... hmmm....  My gramps and brother had their typical GRINGO breakfast, bacons, eggs, toast, etc... nothing that WOW'ed me.  Mom had their jalapeño eggs with bacon, again same score 2/5......  will i be back? nope, but if I ever land in the same aiport, ill be sure to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Never go here! This place totally rips you off! $ Dollars for 4 small Marta, a shitty beef patty and i spent 100 dollars! Biggest rip off in the USA! This is robbery and a disgrace to Charlotte! NEVER, NEVER GO IN THIS PLACE! Mexican is supposed to be cheap!! Pissed"}
{"text":"This place was not the best. It's outrageously expensive!! I had tacos and they cost like $12. For a tiny little cup of guacamole cost about $3.  My tortillas were so flimsy I had to eat them with a for fork, I couldn't even pick them Up without them falling to pieces. The food also didn't have too much flavour.   Even though the food wasn't the best, our waitress was super nice!!"}
{"text":"**NO KID FRIENDLY** Are you kidding me? No kids' menus and no ala carte orders? You expect me to pay $15 for an adult plate of 3 tacos so my kid can eat 2 bites before she's full? Poor service at an airport.   To make matters worse, their margaritas are $16!!! No price on the menu of course!! Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Five minutes at the bar, bartender finally acknowledged that I had here. He said he thought my husband OK if I had anything to eat or drink. Well I paid the bill, I did not eat. No opinion on the food, just the service."}
{"text":"You would get a better burrito if you followed a Mexican person around and had them take a dump in Tortilla and served it at Trump Tower. It also too then forever and cost $20. Never again."}
{"text":"OK let's establish right off the bat that this is a bar/restaurant  INSIDE AN AIRPORT. Still, is it too hard to pleasantly greet a customer when they come in or at least point them to an empty table in this hellhole of an establishment? I've been here twice and like all airport restaurants, the upsell starts as soon as my rear end hits the seat. Do I look like a guy who needs a drink at 9:45am? No, I don't want the keg-sized beer.  And no, I don't want a shot of tequila (for just $2 more!) with my beer.  Food is just ok...sort of a faux-Mex. But the rudeness is what kills this place. The only ones even remotely pleasant are the bartenders, who are constantly trying to push the gigunda-sized beer...and the shot of tequila...."}
{"text":"Horrible. Apathetic waiters.  Brought me 2 different wrong bills.  Would disappear for 15 minutes at a time.  Not a place for an airport with wait staff like tgay.  The food was mediocre.  $10 for a small bowl of guacamole?"}
{"text":"Was my favorite place to stop in Clt airport. Past several times (like 5 in a row) not so much. The attitude is they are doing you a favor serving you. Ill spend my hard earned elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible. Food is poor at best. Service was awful.  I waited 20 minutes to get the wrong order of tacos and Marci the bartender didn't even apologize for the screw up."}
{"text":"Not deserved to get the star at all!! So disappointed!! Avoid this place!! The worst tacos I ever had!!! The service is very very poor.. disrespectful!!"}
{"text":"Just got my vegan tacos in less than 5 min! Fresh and tasty! I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"After walking all over this airport (when did this place get so big??!!) we finally found something that offered a respectable GF option AND drink options! It was crowded at the front of the restaurant. We were about to jump into some seats at the bar when I noticed an almost empty seating area in the back. It was dark. No atmosphere other than \"rushed\". Nothing interesting other than a large Evian bottle, unopened, on every table. EVERY table. When we asked our waitress why they were there she said, \"they are there for a promotion.\" She told us they often slip off the rounded edge of the table. Later, during our meal, we heard a thud behind us. A man (who looked a little like Putin) was picking his Evian bottle off the floor.  We didn't ask if we could drink it or take it and the waitress never offered it to us. Strange.   Steve and I decided to split the carnitas tacos. We had a choice between having our tacos made \"the Mexican way or the American way\". The American way was made with sour cream and cheese. The Mexican way had pico de gallo , cilantro and onions. We opted for Mexican. Duh.  The tacos were very good. The carnitas was excellent and the toppings were fresh. We were pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this bite to eat before continuing our trip to NOLA.  I also had the mango Margarita. It was okay. Plenty of Jose Cuervo and real mango pureè but it was super cold and just okay. I think it was just   sticky sweetness overkill. The glass was meh.   The service was good. Our server, Keisha, was very pleasant and helpful.   I would recommend this place. It was also the only real GF option I had....since I did not want sushi or salad.  We ate here on Wednesday 2/22/17 around 12:50pm."}
{"text":"This is one of mine and my boyfriend's favorite places!  Unfortunately for us, we live in Buffalo and its located in the Charlotte Airport.  We happened to find this place while venturing down to Miami last March 2012.  The service was great!  The margaritas were delicious and the salsa and chips were just what we were craving.  I wish I could remember her name, but its been almost a year now, the waitress/bartender was so accomodating.  She even let me charge my phone while sitting at the bar.  We liked this place so much that the following month we were flying down to the Bahamas, we stopped here and saw her again, while enjoying the margaritas and nachos.  We had a layover on the same trip, except on our way back to Buffalo and had to stop once more!  It has now been almost a year since we have been here.  I have tried coordinating our past two trips through the Charlotte airport (I know, crazy!) just so we could stop here but I have been unsuccessful.  My most recent Miami trip took me through Atlanta and the whole time I wished they had a Tequileria.  Our next trip down South better encompass the Charlotte Airport because we really want to go back!  This place is the perfect spot to kick-start your vacation! (Or end it)"}
{"text":"I got the smoked beef BBQ tacos on flour tortilla and it tastes like I was served leftover meat. My wife got the chic enchiladas and it was the same. You have to pay for chips and salsa. The chips were good though. Way over priced for such nasty Mexican."}
{"text":"Breakfast was fine at the Charlotte airport. The service was very good and the highlight.  If the food had been hot it would have been much better.  I'll be back again as I'm light on places to eat."}
{"text":"Went to grab a margarita and some chips and salsa between flights.  After 15 minutes, still had no chips.  But I did finish the very small and uninspiring $16 margarita, which is apparently their basic house margarita since that's what I asked for.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Why? Why do I do it?   Probably because I just got off a six hour flight and when presented with a giant sign for a \"Tequileria\" my brain got the veto from my nerves.   While I don't necessarily regret it, I ordered a house rocks margarita a and was presented with a martini glass full, plus an extra shaker. Somehow I knew this little extra on the side was not a great value, but was going to set me back. ($13.50, to be exact). It did, however hit the spot.   The food however? I deeply regret. Dollar taco quality. I have absolutely no qualms spending $12 on a couple of tacos, but they'd better be the kind of tacos I want to rave about. These just motivated me to write a two star review even before I board my plane. Iceberg lettuce, ingredients that taste fresh from the can, and flimsy tortillas that rival only the packing material they use between dinner plates.  Consider this a public service announcement. I'd feel guilty if I didn't at the very least try to help people avoid this place - no amount of stress or hunger is worth it. Seriously - I'd rather you grab a Cinnabon."}
{"text":"Came here because its seems they have good food and nice ambiance, however it was a horrible experience. We were there for 20 minutes before we got serviced. We have ordered and its been 40 minutes and our food is not here yet. Mind you this is at the terminal airport. So there goes our flight. Don't come here if you're in a hurry. The service is usually 2 hours minimum before you get served and food total. 2 hours minimum! Bad service! Really bad!"}
{"text":"Being delayed in any airport sucks. Being stuck in the Charlotte, NC airport? Downright torturous.   They have zero decent food options. Unless you like fried, greasy, flavorless  processed \"food.\"  Between Bojangles Chicken and Biscuits and the Nascar Cafe, the pickings are slim.   I thought going to Jose Cuervo Tequileria would be a safe bet. Not that I thought a mediocre at best Tequila brand could provide good \"Mexican\" food, but I figured I could at least order a salad or munch on some nachos and get a decent margarita.   All three of which they managed to completely butcher. The \"margarita\" tasted more like overly sweet, melted freeze pop and they serve you the shaker as if you'd want more. Not sure why they even bother carding, my margarita barely had tequila fumes."}
{"text":"$16 for a 8 oz margarita! It was more mix than tequila.  Save your money and eat literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Mexican place inside the airport near the entrance for gates C and D. Sat quickly, was served quickly, server was a lovely woman who was very attentive. Quick in and out, food was ok but serviceable for an airport joint"}
{"text":"Wow, I should have paid attention to the other reviews. I didn't think that it could be that difficult to screw up a burrito. Okay, I recognize that a burrito isn't exactly authentic, but there are certain implied standards. For example, that the burrito contains beans. My entire burrito appears to have one half bean, total. Other standards: that the salsa doesn't taste like italien spaghetti sauce. I basically got a large tortilla stuffed with some orange tomatoes and a bunch of pulled pork. Skip on this one, for sure."}
{"text":"WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING  I can't do zero 0 stars I definitely would. So far this is the worst Mexican food ever, horrible taste everything frozen from a f... Can.  how dare you guys to call this Mexican food?? I travel to Mexico and other USA state's restaurants many. I have a passion for food my family owns restaurants and definitely this is the worst food preparation EVER. I Order many plates all disgusting tacos, TORTAS, STAKE, MAHI MAHI IT'S NOT EVEN MEXICAN ALL where serve cold and same meat I order mix. Beans no salt, not taste no nothing All frozen meat who knows how long this people keep their food in refrigerator.  Who ever is giving Like or positive reviews I have two questions. You haven't try Real Mexican food from scratch.?  Employees are doing their own reviews.  Please try to go to real Mexican cuisine then you will change your mind and go back to yelp after you know tequilas  and taqueria Pronto!   Not even free will recommended to go there. Sucks."}
{"text":"Stopped here during our lay-over to FL.  I was craving some booze (goes great with Dramamine, you know) after a bumpy landing and thought a margarita would hit the spot.  I pretty much dislike all things Cuervo and, unfortunately, almost the entire tequila menu was varying forms of Cuervo.  I sucked it up and just dealt with it like a good traveling princess should.    The margarita was okay but nothing special.  The lady had a glass of wine and we split chips and salsa.    We waited around for the waiter to take note we'd finished for probably 10 minutes.  Not a huge deal normally, but when your patrons run the risk of missing flights, service should come before joking around with your co-workers.    The total bill was around $30.. ouch!  Yes I know, I know... it's the airport.  It's supposed to be over-priced, but considering the lack of service and poor tequila selection (at a place that has \"tequila\" in the name no less) I was pretty well disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before my flight and got the fish tacos, which were decent and come with rice and beans, neither of which are stellar. Service was swift, if not a bit pushy. They really promote their tequila, and it seems a lot of people drink it. I overheard a woman near me suggest to the man who sat next to get an extra shot of tequila in his margarita because it wasn't very strong."}
{"text":"Service was slow.   Burrito consisted of \"carnitas\" which contained more refried beans than pork, black beans and cheese. No veggies in sight! It was serviced with a large side of \"salsa\" that was more like ketchup & was loaded with high fructose corn syrup.   Chips were cold & stale.   All this for $12!!!  Next time, I'll go to the BBQ place. At least I can get veggie side dishes there..."}
{"text":"The beer was cold, that is about the only good thing I could say about this place.  Even just sitting down I was barked at by the bartender and told not to move the stool our from the bar so I could even get in and sit!  I am only 5'5\" and the stools are about 4 and a half feet tall, if 3 are pushed together how the #$%@ am I supposed to sit if I don't move one out? Bossing around your customers before they even have their A$$ in the seat is not a good way to start out the relationship.  The encounter ended with the other bartender, who was taking care of us and seemed a little nicer, trying to pass off someone else's check to us.  It was no accident either as he freely told us that he gave our check to the guy who had been next to me and that this one was basically the same thing (we had 4 beers and this was a couple of drinks and some food).  Having worked in bars and restaurants for some time I knew this was totally shady and instead he give me one for what I had had.  Lo and behold when he did as asked the check was $3-$4 cheaper than the one he was trying to get me to cover.  I can guarantee you this money would have been more likely to end up in the bartenders pockets and not the till had I just complied and paid it.  And for the record, 4 Sam Adams drafts should not total $38 before the tip unless your in an NYC club or something of the like!  Overall a very underwhelming experience!"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've ever eaten at an airport and it was almost $30 for a slimey salad, chips, salsa, and something that resembled guacamole. The chips and salsa were out of a bag as another reviewer said.  I really wish I saw the Jamba Juice around the corner before I ordered at this gross place."}
{"text":"While having a good bit of time for a layover, we were looking to shift it into a Latin-American gear a little early before our flight to Puerto Rico out of the Charlotte airport.   The tables were clean, and the server was extremely pleasant and attentive, but the food was really not the bee's knees. We had chips and salsa, with the salsa tasting pretty much like Pace (not my fave), and a triple side of quac (since the order is actually quite small our server was kind enough to combine three orders into a larger bowl). The guac was pretty flavorless, and we heard the same from our buddies that ordered the quesadilla.   They did have Tecate though, and limes, and again our waiter was great and the bill wasn't a total punch in the gut since we didn't order that much. I would say if you're in a South of the Border state-of-mind at the Charlotte airport, a Tecate at Tequileria will do you right, but maybe try and spice up the food with some lime juice and/or an unmarked vile of house blended spices (like the one my mom gives me and expects me to carry around to season my food)."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. The service is horrible, the food is terrible. My burrito came out the tortilla was soggy, they don't even use Hispanic style rice it and the whole meal was just blah had no taste. Our waitress was rude beyond words basically through my food in my face when she brought it out. I waited for a refill on my drink for over 20 minutes and still never received it. I should have read the reviews before I chose to eat here."}
{"text":"Okay so you are in the mood for some great Mexican food.  You want to head out to Charlotte International Airport and give this place a try.  Right?  Of course not. The reason you are eating here is because your flight was cancelled and suddenly you have five hours to kill at CLT airport.  That's why I ate here last Friday night, and that's the only reason anybody eats here.  The place is full of tired, grouchy travelers, with their luggage stacked all over the floor and on the seats, and all that anybody just wants is to get the hell out of that airport and go home. It's depressing.   Don't try to compare this place to a good local Mexican place in your own neighborhood.  Anyhow -- I ordered chicken enchiladas, which were revolting. They tasted like fish, not chicken, and they were swimming in a watery green sauce.  The refried beans were like wallpaper paste.  I ordered a draft beer, which tasted slightly suspicious.  The water does taste a little funny here.  The lady next to me ordered a shockingly expensive premium margarita that seemed to be mostly water.  You can't get out the door for much less than $20 per person.  In other words, it's about what you'd expect.  To his credit, my waiter was working hard and trying to make the best of a bad situation.  I wouldn't want his job.  Whatever.  At least I got home eventually.  The food here may be terrible, the prices high, and the atmosphere depressing. But I'm sure I'll be back some day and so will you.  The good news is that CLT has free wifi, so at least you are able to check the YELP reviews and know what you are getting into."}
{"text":"Awful! I stopped here during my layover in Phoenix and I was higly dissapointed. I love mexican food but this was disgusting. I ordered the steak tacos; the steak had an almost burnt taste to it with absolutely no seasoning. The entree came with black beans and mexican rice, they were both also VERY bland. The service also was pretty bad; my waitress was very slow. I sat there for 15min before she even asked me if I wanted a drink. I definetely don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had the nachos with chicken. It was good except the cheese was stuck to the paper in a few spots. DO NOT order the guacamole! It's absolutely disgusting. No way they make it fresh. Service was a little slow especially once the place filled up."}
{"text":"I had a long layover and had time to enjoy a meal so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I started with the chips and salsa which was over priced but it is the airport. The chips are average but I enjoyed the salsa. I ordered the green chicken enchiladas and was extremely pleased. They were tender, flavorful, moist and tangy. I had a side of guacamole which was really good! It was a satisfying and enjoyable airport meal. I would go back if time allows."}
{"text":"Food overall good. The service blah. Examples:  1. The wings are described as \"chile honey glazed sauce\" but tasted more like sweetened \"red hot sauce\" . 2. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and asked server if I could get it with \"raw onions\" rather than \"sweetened pickled onions\" and was informed that they were not available though the vegetarian menu stated  \"onions\" as part of the dish, not to mention he did not even attempt to inquire if that would be a possibility.  3. Our server did not check on the status of our food until prompted to do so.   The result one of the worse tips that I've ever given and not the most pleasant experience."}
{"text":"BLUF:  Pretty bad and pretty expensive.    Went to the to-go section and it was exactly fast.  Staff was fine.  Food was not good.  Poor quality everything.  Got the pork with veggies and the veggies was more like a salsa and the pork was minced to a degree that made it unrecognizable.  Boooooo"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Bad. Don't recommend esp when you're trying to get a quick meal before your flight."}
{"text":"I liked the food here.  Got some enchiladas with a side of margarita.  Nothing really good or bad to report.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"Ok.  The rice and beans tastes just like my mama's.  Excellent.  The quesedilla was questionable.  Too much cheese and grease I think.  The price.  Let's just say it was more than I expected.   Mas caro!"}
{"text":"Manager wanted me to move my luggage from beside me to make room for people at the bar. However the gentlemen next to me had his in the same location on his side. No people were at the bar and the tables in the bar area were open. He clearly didn't want my patronage so I left. Will not be back"}
{"text":"This place was subpar. The food was cold and the service was wack. I don't normally give people two stars but this wasn't a great experience. I walked away with a tummy ache. I won't be visit this location again to say the least.   Prices are fine but the food isn't the best!"}
{"text":"Great margarita- it was SO expensive $18.77 with tip.,... but very very good - This is airport food and bar folks so its highway robbery- BUT The service and  staff was unbelievably friendly and fast I had a grilled shrimp salad and it was delicious...."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST:  I ordered steak & eggs at the waiter's recommendation and it was delicious. The steak was tender and flavorful but not over bearing.  The server was helpful, friendly and prompt.  I asked for honey for my coffee and he delivered it quickly. Much to my surprise they serve my favorite coffee, Douwe Egberts!!  I took a cup to go.  I recommend this restaurant and I will patronize them again based on this great experience."}
{"text":"We decided to give Tequileria a try during a layover in Charlotte.  The service was way slower than I would expect for an airport restaurant with people trying to catch flights (we had to flag our waitress down every time we needed something...to order, more water, our bill, etc) but the food was good.  I had the nachos with guacamole and my husband had the chicken tacos.  The food was along the lines of a chain casual dining Mexican restaurant (think Don Pablos or On the Border) but it was surprisingly decent for airport food!      Overall, the food was decent and ambiance was fun.  Coming back from a tropical vacation, Tequilera was a great way to extend the vacation feeling for just a little bit longer!"}
{"text":"Had a 2 hour layover on our way to Myrtle Beach and decided to eat dinner here. We ordered the chips and salsa, (not complimentary, but 4.99) and we also had the chicken tortilla soup and chicken quesadillas. I ordered a margarita, which was awesome, so I ordered another, because we had time :) We received our bill and it was 51.00. I asked my husband what the heck did we eat? And I looked at the bill and was shocked to find each margarita was $15.00. Wow, that is a record margarita price...most expensive I have ever seen. Food was ok, service not so much."}
{"text":"Why didn't I read this before I sat down and ordered.  This is an airport people are on the GO!!! If I wanted that \"slow\" southern feel then I wouldn't be at the airport.  Terrible service. I can't name anything good. Food was bland. Waitress running around all crazy but only had 3 tables. Airport service requires you to be proficient and fast. They lacked EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Can I have more steak with this Fat!? Geez! It was a tiny steak with more fat and it will run you 16+ rip off never again.  Only good thing is the TVs with ESPN!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are served quickly and are pretty tasty. I thought the service at the bar was pretty decent too. However, the food...not so good. I got the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was rubbery. I would stop by again but would only indulge in the margaritas and grab lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been here twice as they are in the CLT airport! I cannot review their food, however I CAN review their million dollar margarita - WORTH EVERY PENNY! It is made with fresh lime juice and NOT a mix! They are made upon ordering! I highly recommend stopping in while you are in CLT!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport. The drinks are a tad overpriced but my food was good - I had the chicken verde enchiladas. They came out quick. I cleaned up the plate. Service was fine and the music was good too although a bit loud (salsa, merengue, cumbia, bachata), but I thought it was weird that there were no Mexicans on staff."}
{"text":"Bad food! Their corn burrito tasted like white refined flour. Money wasted and appetite killed!"}
{"text":"Worst airport food I've had in quite awhile.  Burrito had canned dog food consistency and a burned off-taste.  Wife's fish taco not much better. Retried beans were the worst!  Stale sandwich from a machine would've been better tasting."}
{"text":"Nasty food and piss poor food serving. They had a barback cleaning glasses serving and moving clean glasses into the shelf with his diseased meat sticks."}
{"text":"Huevos rancheros are edible but eggs are out of a carton so your only choice is scrambled. Service was good but the food is not. Not sure why Charlotte can't get a good restaurant at the airport!"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas!!!!!!food ok...friendly service.....very loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a convenient area for all gates. Nice interior design and nice wait staff but the salad was not that great. It did not taste like it had been tossed with dressing. Well, this is Tequileria, after all, that is what you are supposed to enjoy. Tequila!"}
{"text":"I disagree with the dated critical reviews others have written on this restaurant.  My husband, friends and I recently visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon before our flight.  The restaurant was clean and uncrowded.    The house margaritas we ordered were delicious, generously sized, served in shakers, and left us all delightfully buzzed so we could better tolerate the oppressive coach seating  on our transcontinental flight.    The waitress informed us the restaurant only pours Cuervo because the company that owns Jose Cuervo also owns the restaurant.   Everyone in our group commented on how much they enjoyed their food.  My husband loved the crab cakes he was served.  The carnitas quesadilla I ordered was incredibly good.  Each person in our group was pleasantly surprised with the superior quality of the food and drink we were served. Such high caliber and tasty offerings are a welcome relief from the bland fare usually served at most airport restaurants.   I look forward to visiting this restaurant again the next time I travel to Charlotte. ."}
{"text":"This place was a delicious surprise! The breakfast Poblano Peppers and Eggs was out of control!! If I have flights transferring through CLT, I will definitely do my best to get there before 11am."}
{"text":"The only place in this airport that has a vegan option for food! Praise the lord! The black bean , roasted corn burrito is delicious and they also have it in the morning for breakfast! My waiter was super nice and knowledgable as well!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to in terms of food. The service is good and the atmosphere is nice, but paying $11 for a small veggie burrito that is 75% undercooked rice is not something I'd recommend. For comparison, a veggie burrito from chipotle is $7, and you get twice as much food and flavor. Overall, this place is a below average rip off. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross. We'll start with my $17 margarita. (The prices for alcohol aren't printed on the menu. Yes, I should have asked. No, I never could have dreamed a 12-ounce drink would cost $17!) Came out warm and watery. It's like it had sat, iced for an hour before I ordered it. The food was worse. Greasy chips with average salsa and queso that tasted like thick milk. Thank god my BF and I made the decision to share tacos. I don't think I could have made it through my own \"plate\" of food. The taco shells were so flimsy/soggy from sitting for who knows how long, when we attempted to pick them up they totally disintegrated. We doused them in cohula and choked down one each (out of a serving of three) using a knife and fork. Shame on you, Charlotte Douglas. Just because you have a captive audience of travelers doesn't mean you can get away with serving this crap. Never again! I'll pack a brown bag lunch before I eat from a HMSHost joint again."}
{"text":"Upon walking in here I could smell old alcohol that seemed that it hasn't been cleaned up from the floor for weeks. This was a real turn off.  I mean the place kinda stank. I was in a rush to catch a plane, so I decided to stick it out and give it a chance. I ordered the Mexican Skirt steak. The flavor of the steak was surprisingly pretty tasty and it was tender. The rice and beans with which it came with was just OK.   The tortillas however were pretty awful, and resembled something more like cardboard.    Given that this place is in an airport, I would say that it wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the location.  This is easily the worst \"Mexican food\" I have tasted in my life. The only thing Mexican about the food might be the description on the menu. I ordered the Tequila Lime Tacos and they honestly tasted like cardboard.  The staff is attentive and quick and the venue is somewhat welcoming but the food is simply unacceptable.  If the food was edible I might have given this place two stars to recognize the staff and their speed, but my disgust for the food prevails."}
{"text":"Service 4.5 Fundito 2.5 (it's just cheese and tasteless ground beef) you need to eat it fast or it becomes a brick of cheese that destroys your chips. Enchiladas verdes 3 (not really that flavorful) Tamales 4 (my GF had these)  Overall skip this place and find another restaurant to eat at.  I wish I did."}
{"text":"5 Stars reflects the outstanding service and food quality received versus the 2 star rating: apparently there are more than a few people who compare airport prices with off airport prices. Grow the fck up.  Also astonishing is a bad review from someone who expected a place called \"Tequileria,\" to be \"kid friendly?\" WTF? You couldn't find a fast food place that served happy meals at the airport? Jeeze!  Anyway, the presentation and taste of my guacamole appetizer and tortilla soup were terrific! Bar service from Pat was courteous and prompt!"}
{"text":"Being stuck in Charlotte sucked and we were also starving too. This was the first place that we thought looked decent. I ordered the mango salad. They filled a large plate with chopped up romaine, tomatillo slices, diced tomatoes, jalapeño pieces and slivers of mango. The dressing was decent but the salad looked like a taco topping but tons of it. We also got two tacos that were good but nothing spectacular. The order of nachos was big but it had too many pieces of jalapeño. You could probably split it three ways as an app but the two if us polished it off. I ate about half of the salad and it still looked untouched."}
{"text":"When will CLT get another Mexican restaurant? If this place was located outside of the airport it would have been out of business years ago. I thought something would have changed in a year since my last review but no. I ordered the exact same meal with more problems than before: taco salad with no meat. It came out with chicken. I sent it back and in about 1 minute (enough time to pick off the chicken instead of making another one) it came back missing the tortilla strips. The server brought me a handful in a bowl. Still the same problem with drenching the salad with dressing. Ease the \"f\" up will ya? Geez.   Unless I desire an over-priced Margarita I will not be venturing into this subpar restaurant again."}
{"text":"Do I have to give it a star?  Awful in every way you fear an airport restaurant will be. Quasi-cheese seems to be the primary ingredient in the food. The drinks are watery. The service is indifferent."}
{"text":"Charlotte airport does not have very many eating options fast food or more. This little Mexican place is a seat yourself and kill some time experience. Overpriced for what it is I at least didn't feel hassled and the staff were friendly while I killed some time with my QUESO. The menu is a bit confusing for no good reason, but airport eating is a low expectation experience. Despite my jet lag I would go back and get a full meal."}
{"text":"Worst tortilla soup ever.  More like a Luke warm chili with a big glob of guacamole on top.  I sent it back.   My friend ordered a quesadilla and they delivered enchiladas.   If he wasn't so tried he would have sent them back  Knowing we're were not happy they did comp the meal, which was good ( and raised the rating by one star)."}
{"text":"The only time in my life I've had a plate of rice and beans that was actually BAD. Until now, I had staunchly felt that this was a dish that was impossible to botch, no matter what caliber of Mexican restaurant you're in. Wrong. The extent to which they cut corners here shows, even in the most basic of dishes. The rice was dry, the beans had zero texture. The tacos my husband ordered were clearly just microwaved meat and cheese on a tortilla. Everything seems like it's been sitting around for days, and is just tossed onto a plate. Even the salsa, which also rarely is a disappointment in most places, was no good - it just tasted like pureed tomatoes, with a heavy dose of added onion. Service was slow, and we had to wait a long time for our check, which is a cardinal sin in airport restaurant. My expectations weren't high, but this place was worse than expected. Plus, it was early in the day, and the menus were already filthy (who knows how long ago they had been cleaned...think about how gross that is, especially in an airport). Frankly, this place couldn't get anything right. Skip it - you're better off eating at 1897, on the other side of the atrium."}
{"text":"3.5 star: i almost walked out - it took a while for my server to acknowledge me. Finally after a long wait she was very friendly and prompt. The food was yummy & service after the wait was great!!"}
{"text":"I had the barbicoa soft tacos and for airport food it was decent. I would come back here even if it was not in an airport to try more."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Server didn't even come to our table.  Took our order from the station which was near our table.  I asked if they had Mojitos, she told me No and never took any alternate drink order (if she'd bothered to come to the table maybe she could have given me other options).  Fish tacos were so-so, I didn't finish them.  Everything seemed to come from a can.  Bland, and mushy.   Service was pretty uninspired and not very quick.  Walk a little further or stop at the burger place in the airport.  Charlotte airport has so many other options.  Our meal was over $50 for 2 fish tacos, a burrito, and a margarita.  Considering the quality, they should be ashamed."}
{"text":"No Chips and salsa served prior to order as expected at most Mexican restaurants.  Since I was by myself it appears that I did not qualify for the usual expectations when eating at a Mexican restaurant.  Food way over priced for the quality...do not recommend.  Also very loud atmosphere...couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Very busy so just hope you can get a table.  Many options and vegetarian as well.  The pork chimi was huge and veggie burrito was awesome!  Worth a stop when you have a layover in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I always order the crab cakes. They are always very good and quick to get the order if your in a hurry. They also have a nice selection of tequila if your looking for a nice margarita. It's normally pretty crowded but moves  quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered the fruit plate or \"Plato de Frutas\" and it was small and had few slices of fruit. Not worth what the price. The floor had a lot of trash and I don't know if it is always like this or maybe just because it is like 9:30 PM  but it was not so clean. The waitress was average and did not hear us asking for the bill until the 4th time. Other food was just ok. Nothing above average."}
{"text":"Surprising to find food this good at the airport, but the Charlotte airport really is top notch as far as that goes.  Lots of good choices.  Tequileria has a great menu which can get you something fast and easy to handle, kind of like a burger (but better!) or you can get something messy too.  Great grab and go selections as well.  I was able to get a quesadilla and soft drink in about 5 minutes and be able to eat it before I got onto the plane.  This place is in the main terminal section between C and D, I believe.  Pretty sure it is between City News and Starbucks."}
{"text":"Absolutely Vile.  Cranky service and prison quality food.  Avoid.  Some airport places are good this one should be better and it's just gross."}
{"text":"Trouble flying?  How about a little tequila to get you going?  Assuming you are not the pilot, there really should not be a problem.  Airline food has changed quite a bit - from essentially no food on the first flights, where most people were probably rather amazed to be flying at all, to rather decent food being served for the locale, then to cardboard variations that most would be hard-pressed to call food at all, now to almost no food unless you pay for it.  So these days, you will probably want to fill up before you get on the plane.  As such, you may want to make a decent choice, and this is not a bad selection - in the morning you do not have a lot of options, and when it comes to sitting down, there are even fewer.  It would be better if the service improved, and the prices were not as bad as they are, but you are in an airport.  That said, the selection is decent, if not outstanding, and the food is okay.  Just remember the tequila."}
{"text":"Typical airport bar but sitting at the bar has left me a bit nauseous. Lots of smells fill the air including bleach, old beer, and tequilla.  The cupboards are worn out and falling off the hinges.  Bar tenders are fast which is nice if you have a plane to catch but for long lay-over folks, feels like you're being forced to choke down your beer to free up a space for the next customer.  Didn't try the food so no idea how that is but based on the smells, you'll want to try another place. Barbacoa quesadilla looked good based on the guy next to me but I couldn't bare the thought of trying one for myself.  My one positive comment is that the beers are cold and the margaritas are the best bang for your buck.  Go here if you want a fast beer before a flight but not if you want a relaxing chill spot to kill time."}
{"text":"Big space with TVs and great AC. Service was fast as was the food and drink. I got the house margarita (delicious) and the chicken quesadilla. Honestly, if you want a 'dilla, don't get chicken. Everything tasted great and it came with salsa, sour cream, and gaucemole. But there was so little chicken I thought they'd brought me the wrong order, but, in fact there was JUST enough (about 2 cubes per 'dilla wedge) to classify it as 'with chicken'. Just get cheese and save a couple bucks.  Staff is very friendly and attentive. I'd come back of I had another layover, if I had a buddy I'd get absolutely pissed in this joint, because damn do I love tequila!"}
{"text":"I tried the taco salad and if I ate was because I had to catch a flight and had no time to go back and complaint. The lettuce was old and the chicken did not look like chicken. The sauce was not even good either. Won't be going there again!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Ordered the fish tacos and they should be renamed to the lettuce and packaged cheese tacos. Terrible food, even for airport standards."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're in a hurry.  But if you have time and none of the other mediocre restaurants in the food court here pique your interest....   The food is fine, but not amazing.  I had been excited for the Asian Chicken Salad at CPK (which I look forward to at this airport, for some reason), but they don't make it anymore.  I ended up here, but should have skipped it."}
{"text":"Not a bad quick meal between flights.   I had very low expectations because of the poor ratings on Yelp.   Perhaps that is why I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy my shredded chicken nachos. Keep in mind the nachos have white cheese, not yellow cheese.   The dish had good flavor and the chips were thin and crispy.   Marci will get you outta there fast."}
{"text":"If you've got a lot of time to kill as you're flying through CLT, give this place a try. If you don't have much time, you might consider another place.   I had a few hours to kill recently and was a bit hungry. I've been here before and had decent service, so we stopped in for some chicken nachos. We asked for a few of the published ingredients on the side like the sour cream, but didn't see tomatoes listed and one of us wasn't happy to see them on the dish. There was also a random french fry in our pile of nachos that I uncovered and lost my appetite. Hey... if a huge french fry can make it into my chicken nachos, what else could be lurking in there that's a lot smaller (and grosser). See.. now you aren't hungry now, are you?  The order in which our order was placed was: Water, Beer, Chicken Nachos. The order in which was received was: Chicken Nachos. Long Wait. Beer. Long Wait. Reminder about water and silverware. Wait. Water. Wait. Silverware.   Honestly, if I needed a place to sit for a couple of hours and charge my phone while drinking a beer, this is the place I would come to. If I'm hungry and wanting decent food that's quick, I probably wouldn't come here."}
{"text":"Beware that there are no prices on the menu outside the restaurant which I think is BS. They finally have prices on the interior food menu but not on the drink menu. So I ordered a margarita thinking, how much could it really be?!... well, It's $16.88 to be exact. Rebecca the bartender was great but the prices were not my taste."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast during a layover.  Compared to other airport food it's actually pretty good.  My only real complaint is that they don't have fresh eggs, come on!  All they have is \"pre-beaten.\""}
{"text":"The service is a little under the TLC. The waiter did not come check up on us, we would have to call for attention. But overall the food was great. The chicken quesadilla was super good and the guacamole with chips was also good. great stop while doing a layover"}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad here on a Friday night. Like many hotel restaurants, you seat yourself. We waited for a good 10 minutes before making eye contact with a server to come over. We ordered chips/guac and two margaritas. The chips came out around 10 minutes before the margaritas, which was rather annoying.  It's just as overpriced as all other airport food, but combined with the terrible service it REALLY irked me.  It only gets two stars because the guacamole was actually really good."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for one reason... my experience was nowhere near the 2 stars rating this establishment currently has. My bartender was extremely attentive and nice. The guacamole was delicious and... I'm at an airport!  I do wish they had two things I asked for but they didn't have: mezcal & other hot sauces aside from Cholula."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but this does not remotely resemble Mexican or Tex-Mex. very disappointed"}
{"text":"The eggs were from powder, the salsa probably canned, the barbacoa dry, refried beans microwaved. I'm not sure if anything here was actually made here. Such a shame. I'll go to Taco Bell next time and save 15 bucks."}
{"text":"Pretty meh. Pork quesadilla was fine. However, the restaurant itself is pretty dirty. Tables pretty much go un-bused. They really really need to clean their ice maker, lots of weird black flakes frozen in the ice cubes."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were horrible. Freezer burn made it taste like cardboard, super dry and did not attempt to eat the second taco."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that's located where the Cheers used to be in the Charlotte airport. This is okay, nothing special. If you're in a hurry, it'll do -- hey, it's an airport. On my way from Asheville to Phoenix I snagged a chair at the bar where the bartender proceeded to recommend the most expensive thing on the menu. I, instead, ordered what the heck I wanted.   Lots of TVs and a long bar, and just remember -- you're in an airport..."}
{"text":"So many better places at CLT than this overpriced poor attempt at Mexican food. Margarita, no prices on menus, but $16. Burrito, small and lifeless, was $14. I normally don't complain about price but given price and quality Tequileria should be avoided. The one positive was a hard working waiter who did what he could to make it enjoyable."}
{"text":"This possibly the worst meal and worst margarita I have ever had. The margarita was $15 and consisted of mostly syrup and ice. It was weak, lacked flavor and character and did not deserve to be called a margarita.   The tacos were a disgrace to mexican food everywhere. I don't even know where to begin. I thought they served me a salad initially. I couldn't see any shell or meat under mountainous servings of cheese and lettuce. I managed to excavate the shell and meat and eat it only to be dissapointed in both the flavor, texture and general composition of these \"tacos\". I paid another 15$ for a bag of cheese and lettuce dumped onto a plate.   The best part of my meal was the lone french fry I encountered while painfully digging through lettuce and cheese. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"I realize i shouldn't expect much from an airport bar but I was craving a margarita.  The most attention I received from the bartender, although I was waving my hands and calling out for my server, was the heavy handed encouragement to order the \"top-shelf\" Margarita.   I stupidly fell for it, only later to realize, my plane ticket was comparable in price. I finally ordered my food from a different bartender and then had the long wait for my bill... Good thing i wasn't trying to catch a plane.  ahh wait..."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as a bookmark for myself to never order here again.   I got tacos from the to-go counter. 3 tacos took 27 minutes to make. I had to beg the staff for literally any food from the kitchen just so I could make my flight.   To add insult to injury, the tacos were cold, didn't come topped with what I wanted and just had iceberg lettuce and pre-shredded cheese.   Worst spend of $13 ever in an airport."}
{"text":"I got the chicken chimichanga. It was the best iv ever ate. Really a whole knew flavor. It was amazing. The beans were very strong and the rice was very bland. I couldn't eat either of them. I got a margarita which was very good and a lot of it. The waitress was very fast and kept checking on us but got a little attitude at one point. She could have just been having a bad day. It happens. I would try it if you want a different take on a chimichanga."}
{"text":"Looks promising on the outside, and the food looks appetizing but BEWARE - they are SLOW as molasses.  We sat down around 1pm thinking we could easily eat a meal before our flight at 2pm. The food hit the table at 10 minute to 2pm. We had to shovel it into take out containers and run to the terminal. You would think that an airport restaurant would understand time constraints...   The food was okay, nothing spectacular - but not bad. The veggies & fruits were fresh. The nachos were nothing to write home about. As mentioned by others, the music is horrendous."}
{"text":"Fail. That was no burrito. Hella wasteful.  Styrofoam, really? What 1980s landfill nightmare am I in?  The food itself was fine. Plastic but fine.   But it was rolled as loose as a... and then sliced half so everything fell apart as soon as I picked it up. No wonder they tried to give me a fork and a spoon. For a burrito?!? Fail. These people need to get to a taqueria.  All you need is tinfoil. Save yourselves some money and save my burrito."}
{"text":"Pretty good airport food when you've got about an hour to spare in Charlotte. Like all the other locales nearby, it's very expensive for what you get. But it's a nice alternative to Burger King. They have express versions of what they sell in the sit down restaurant next door. And they have a bunch of grab and go items like salads, sandwiches, fruit bowls, etc.   Several choices of meat for your tacos or salad, and the softest flour tortillas I've had in ages. Not spicy but plenty of flavor in the beef. The service was again pretty typical of airport dining, but the turnaround was fairly quick...and in an airport that's priceless.   Overall a good solid choice for a quick meal during your layover."}
{"text":"Mahi mahi tacos were good. Ordered a martini and was told that they were pretty small,so I ordered a double. Almost passed out when I got the tab though- $27 for the drink!"}
{"text":"Not great. Was never greeted. Waitress told me she would be right back. Never did. Moved to bar. One bartender looked me right in the eye, but kept walking. The second one...took my order, checked my ID, and then disappeared. Never came back. It would be funny if it wasn't true."}
{"text":"In the main terminal by concourse C, keep on walking! Horrible burrito! First off, it's $17! It's small for the price and it's mostly filled with rice!  Might have been 3 tablespoons of chicken in the whole thing. Poor excuse for a burrito folks-- I've had better at taco bell and that ain't sayin' alot!"}
{"text":"I started early today, and Tequileria was the choice for breakfast. It was not great food by any stretch of the definition, it was not even great food by airport standards. I had the huevo rancheros with chorizo , and I was disappointed. To serve huevos rancheros you must know how to prepare the dish! My server Shannon  was great :)"}
{"text":"The appeal of this place is their name.  When you're coming off from a long flight and have some time to kill during your layover, you know that this place is gonna serve alcohol.  Unfortunately, since I was traveling on Army orders to a class, and would have to take a physical fitness test in a few days, I had to hold back from the liquor.    It was crowded in there, but the bartender greeted us immediately and invited us to sit there. Had it not been so close to the walkway/entrance, we might have taken him up on the offer since it was right in front of the TV that was playing the basketball game.  Luckily, we found a table more toward the inside of the restaurant so we could get some personal space.    My buddy and I both ordered the enchiladas.  I was ok with the plastic utensils, but when the food tasted like cafeteria style quality, I felt it was way overpriced, even considering it being in an airport.  The black beans and rice were just ok.  Next time, I'll just come here for the drinks when I want to get smashed for my next flight."}
{"text":"Two waitresses were running around the entire restaurant super busy while the lazy bartender guy watched football. We asked him for a glass of wine that we had ordered from our waitress and he refused to pour it for us. Wow. Need to work on your customer service and team work skills."}
{"text":"Wow, really really bad food... even for an airport..."}
{"text":"On an unexpected layover at Charlotte Airport this week, I got a Veggie Burrito to go from Tequileria. It was super dissapointing -- starting with a very dry tortilla AND extremely sad contents. Other than beans, it had some pieces of corn  i.e. apparently the corn made it a veggie burrito. Hmm, how about some sauteed zucchini/ onions, etc that are actually vegetables? Upside:  the salsa that came with the burrito (no chips) was good. Maybe go somewhere else if you're craving Mexican -- Salsarita's?"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, nothing but Cuervo, bleh. We came in needing some solid food and were sorely disappointed that they didn't even serve booze until 7am. At an airport?! Heresy. The breakfast was gross, to boot."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast but had an overall poor experience. Eggs were cold and bad, bacon too salty, coffee watered down, service slow and table and menus were dirty. There is great need for good Mexican with fast airport service. This is an opportunity to turn things around. Experience matters!"}
{"text":"The last burrito I had that was this awful was from my elementary school's cafeteria. The chicken was stringy, watery and looked and smelled like cat food. There were almost no beans and the rice was crunchy. The rest of the contents were cold shredded cheese and iceberg lettuce. The tortilla was grocery store quality and the salsa tasted like cheap tomato sauce. You can do a lot better for $13, even in an airport."}
{"text":"Is it expensive? Yes. Is the food really good? Not really. But for what it is, it's a good little spot. You can't really expect much at the airport other then high prices and mediocre food lol. But if you're hungry and in the mood for some Mexican food, this will do just fine in a pinch."}
{"text":"I went to the take out. It was expensive and the worst burrito that I've ever had. One server was surely and the other very nice."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since it seemed a little different than the typical airport fare. Turns out I was wrong. Although I applaud them for trying something a little different, my $8 mexican chicken sandwich (torta) had no flavor or seasoning. The bread was decent, but that's about it."}
{"text":"If you have the bad luck to fly through Charlotte, the Tequileria isn't a bad place to waste some time. The chips were good and the salsa wasn't bad. Added a bunch of salt and hot sauce to kick it up. I had the fish tacos and tea. With tax and tip $31.00 - ouch. It was at least quiet and un-rushed."}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos without any meat.  The poorly prepared and packaged meal was rock hard, stale, oily nacho chips with a small sprinkle of cheese topped with two cups of spicy salsa and a spoon of sour cream.  I was not happy!  The meal was around $10 and I ended up throwing half of it away.  Besides the fact that it was unappetizing, I had a medical school interview and the salsa was overflowing from the sides of the container (does not work with a suit).    Don't waste your money or your time!  I waited for my food for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Don't have many options for Mexican at this airport, so this is the place to go for margaritas.  Unfortunately, each margarita is $12!  My two tacos were $14.  That's $7.00 for one small, lackluster taco.  Wow.  Actually, the mahi fish wasn't bad, but definitely over priced.  I'll avoid this establishment going forward as the food is just average, but the prices are way above average."}
{"text":"I stopped in here because I had a two hour layover.  The order took over 30 minutes which still seems too long considering it's an airport.  The service was bad because I had to tell them twice I needed salsa.  The food is bland, especially the rice.  No flavor in this food and you don't even get free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"If this place were anywhere but the airport, it wouldn't make it 6 months.  That's sad.  My guess is that the owners only care about revenue and not quality.  And because they have a captive audience, this isn't about caring or doing right by their customers.  The place is dirty, the drinks are weak, the chips are greasy, and they are horrendously understaffed.  In a locale where people are CLEARLY on the move, service couldn't be any slower.  I sat at a table and when 10 minutes went by without any service at all, I moved to the bar.  Waited another 10 minutes and finally got helped.  Imagine the revenue an airport restaurant would do if they actually served a better than average product, at a FAIR price AND cared about great customer service!"}
{"text":"Not very good. I'm a foodie. And I happened to have a ravenous appetite which should have masked even mediocre food. I ordered the chimichanga and it was blah.  Thick doughy crust and minuscule amounts of pulled pork. The rice was was large grained white unseasoned rice and tasted like it had been in an unsealed cardboard box absorbing surrounding odors. The refried beans were plain.  It was just a pretty poor quality meal for the $12.59 airport price tag."}
{"text":"To be fair all I had was a couple of beers waiting for a connecting flight.  The menu looked interesting and there were certainly many tequila varieties for sampling.  From what I've heard though the food leaves a bit to be desired.  I travel a fair bit so next time I'll try the food and get back to this one."}
{"text":"Wow. Horrible counter staff. Rude, unhelpful, just awful. Why can't Rick Bayless have more outlets. This is bad."}
{"text":"I hate to even give this one star. This is the absolute worst service I have ever received. The server never made eye contact. I was dining alone and she sat my plate in front of the empty chair. It took 40 minutes to get her attention so that I could pay the overpriced bill.  The food was meh. Uncle Bens rice and Fritos bean dip were the sides for my $15 greasy, canned chicken chimichanga.  Don't go! You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Selection was slim and essentially the same thing with one change. Scrambled eggs, bacon, with tortilla, and potatoes. Food was out fast but the eggs were not real and tasteless. The potatoes were seasoned (with a lot of salt). Way too expensive given the food quality, options and food taste. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Had 15 minutes and wanted a quick beer.  Not here, apparently.  Sat at the bar for 10 of those minutes, bartender didnt notice.  I left.  Srsly, who has time for this nonsense.  Step it up Charlotte.  Really looking like slow bumpkins here."}
{"text":"Had a missed connection at CLT, so ended up with a little time to get a meal in before flying off again.  Stopped by Tequileria and put orders in before I got a chance to Yelp.    Damn, was that a mistake...  The tortilla chips were soggy with a giant clump of them all stuck together.  The chimichanga was soggy inside and out.  The chicken in the enchiladas tasted like it was just boiled.  Just stick with straight drinks here.  Don't bother with the food."}
{"text":"I mean, they tried. I think.  With tasteless guacamole, wimpy fish tacos and a watery gin & tonic (sorry, not a margarita gal), the $25+ bill for this sad display was laughable but perfectly typical of an overpriced, underwhelming airport meal. Throw in some gruff service and my three time request for water, and I was happy to get out of there and hop on my connecting flight back to Connecticut.  If I have another future layover in the Charlotte airport, I'll stick to fast food. At least then I know what to expect."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but I wouldn't go there again. The drinks and food just weren't that good. There are better choices in the airport."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, though not terrible.  I'm mainly just frustrated that I could have had better food for less money at salsaritas in the food court.  The menu calls the tacos authentic Mexican, which is a joke.  It's American food that vaguely resembles Mexican. I suggest anything else instead."}
{"text":"Several years ago, I thought \"wow, this place isn't half bad for an airport. And an OK value to boot.\"  Tonight, the food was ok. As far as it went. The $1.75 guac was either a smidgen or a dollop. And the \"large\" beer, well I thought it was the small.  And the menu used to be interesting. Now it is just easy to decide because there are so few choices. Oh well. Next time I'll hit the food court and save my money."}
{"text":"This place was so disgusting, I had to walk out after ordering a water. It was around 7:30pm on a Sunday night with two waiters and two bartenders who were not friendly or helpful. The place was thinning out, but I couldn't fine one clean table. 10-15 tables with dirty dishes, dirty glasses, empty chip baskets. No manager in sight and no waiters in an hurry to clear a table. I found one corner to sit down squeezed next to another couple. I finally decided if it's this dirty in the restaurant, no telling what the kitchen looks like. Not going to stick around to find out. I don't like giving bad reviews, but this place was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I come in here between flight connection. I have been here before. I get served one draft drink. Then handed the receipt. I asked for one more drink and was told my drink was full when it's only a quarter. Marci, this rude bartender said it was the last call. I said I was not made aware. I said I was not made aware and she smirked. It's that how your staff treats people. Then I can tell you travelling every week, I will tell everyone in my company not to come here. Apparently, she is more worried about cleaning than paying customers, tell me how cleaning pays the bar again??? That's what I thought: nothing. What is such a hurry, paying for another disgusting sleeve of tattoo she already has???"}
{"text":"I should have known better than to eat mexican food in a north Carolina restaurant. It was soooo bland! The guac was bland and watery. Same for chicken tacos which fell apart because they only use one per taco (for stewed meats you should almost always use two).   The worst part is they put cilantro on EVERYTHING! I dont have a problem with it except for the fact that it was clearly old. Cilantro is so cheap there is NO excuse for using old cilantro. Maybe I am being harsh but I take my tacos pretty seriously.   The bright spot is that they have lots of TV's and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before coming here! We sat at the bar thinking we'd get better service as bartenders are usually personable! Bar was half full we ordered drinks and quesadillas, 20 min later and when another customer who came after us got his food before us I asked if they could check our food. I was told it usually takes 20 min or so.  Alright then, we waited another 10 min.... I say \"excuse me sir to another bartender\" his response... lifts his pointer finger at me and says \"one second!\" I don't even do that to my 8 year old students! Then approaches us annoyed, I asked about our food and his response\" they are already checking on it! The guy was so rude.... he needs an another profession! The food finally arrived and it was ok. Nothing to write home about but better than the food court."}
{"text":"Oh just don't do it. The food was not good. The drinks are loaded with sour mix. Stick to beer and chips with salsa if you desperately need somewhere to park until your next flight."}
{"text":"Just say no. Especially to the so-called \"Pronto\" version. Nearly missed my flight. Had to get a refund after waiting 20 minutes. No burrito. Certainly no pronto. Next."}
{"text":"It was convenient and they have tv's. The positives. The queso fundido, was really good. The rest, wasn't so good. Boring food. Feels like it was all microwaved. Service seems bad here to, but we lucked out with one good waitress that was very attentive."}
{"text":"Ripoff alert. Should have read the reviews. Tiny sized margarita full of ice $16 each. So 2 small drinks and appetizer guacamole was almost $60 w tip. They have no drink prices on menu to rip off trusting travelers. Bad business."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, it is the slowest service I have experienced.  I ordered a nacho platter which I figure is a common dish. It does not appear  overly crowded. Food is good but service should be quicker in an airport. 19 minutes and still waiting for nachos...?"}
{"text":"Disgusting overpriced garbage that makes Taco Bell seem gourmet in comparison.  $16 for a tiny crap \"burrito\" with super dry beef, soggy gas station quality tortilla, minimal toppings, and salsa that was clearly from a can. RIPOFF."}
{"text":"For airport food this place gets four, count 'em four, quatro stars.  All day long.  Pricey? Maybe a bit but not bad for good airport food. Super-friendly bartender? Yep, he has been working there for many years. Good food? Yes.   Much better than the standard fair usually found in terminals.  Oh yeah, great margarita and you get to keep the shaker! LOL"}
{"text":"After more than six years, I'm back to update one of my very first reviews. And it has not changed very much.  The food is still mediocre. Today, I chose the chicken quesadilla and found it bland and boring. Served with a small pot of salsa, a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole, it was only for the bottle of Cholula on the table that kept it from being tasteless.  I had a Corona with it and there is something seriously wrong with paying $6.79 for a bottle of Corona. Even at airport prices, that's simply absurd.  Service was good and I was not rushed. If you have a decent layover and a craving for bland Mexican, here's Tequileria. Though the burger joint in C is excellent and the wine place in the atrium is also excellent."}
{"text":"I usually really enjoy their margaritas and limited menu but I tried the skirt steak this time.  I would avoid the skirt steak at all costs. It's the second worst airport steak I have ever encountered. Over cooked, fatty, and I was unable to cut with a knife. I will stick with the chicken next time.   Great location (between C and D) and quick service."}
{"text":"I was in a rush between connections and needed to grab something fairly fast. I got a taco salad, and it was terrible. The romaine lettuce was mostly yellow and hardly any nacho chips. The dressing seem to be ranch with some chili powder mixed in. The barbacoa pork was actually decent."}
{"text":"Not the best food.  Queso was bad, salsa ok and soup was average. Waitress must have had an off day.  She was unfriendly and slow.  Prices were ok but a little whack considering quality.  Portions were acceptable. Overall, I'll look for somewhere else to eat when in this airport"}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible service. Had to chase down server to get one and then had to chase down to get food then same thing to pay bill. The food was a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10."}
{"text":"Ick. Keep walking. Wanted some nachos and a beer. Nachos came with boiled chicken and in a bowl. It's in a bowl because there was an inch of water at the bottom. And except for a few crispy chips on top, the rest was SOGGGGGGGGY! Asked bartender if this was normal as I showed him the creamy water and limp chips. I said \"See?\" He said, \"I can see, it's cuz the chicken is juicy.\" Um no. We brought some extra chips for us to soak up the chicken water and those were salt licks I had to wipe and blow each chip. No, no. and they charge you for a teeny cup of salsa $1.99. Be wary."}
{"text":"$54 for 2 drinks and 6 not so tasty tacos. Do better folks. Won't return here for sure."}
{"text":"Food is 4 star but the service was a 5 star!! The food is very simple but good and it came out super quick! The bartender made the experience. She was very friendly and gave fantastic service. Oh, not to mention she makes a mean margarita!!"}
{"text":"Airport Mexican  Located right on the main hub of Charlotte-Douglas airport, Tequileria is convenient to all the terminals.  This is a great place to meet other travelers in your party or to kill some time before heading down to your final gate area.  Tequileria is large- there are plenty of seats at the bar and tables available.  I hit the bar area typically as it is just me that normally travels. Bar is nothing special, but they do have hooks mounted underneath so you can hang your backpack or small items down by your knees while eating; nice touch there.  There is a decent beer selection considering it is in an airport - but this is not a microbrew kind of place, so set your expectations accordingly.  Menu is a little convoluted: they serve breakfast and Mexican-ish foods.  There are burritos and tacos and you have a variety of preparation \"ways\" for example: choose your meat type, then the \"finishing\" which consists of a few nationalities such as Mexican which gives you some pico de gallo, or American which slathers on the crema (because, you know, we are all fat bastards in this country), and choice of shells, which is nice on paper.  The 3-taco meal with carnitas (pork) is the way I went with soft corn tortillas.   Took a little time to get it out of the kitchen, so I had high hopes but all that went out the window as soon as it tried to pick up my taco- all the water from the pico de gallo dripped through and turned it into a mushy mess.  Too bad as the pork was pretty good and the taco could have been a win.  Chips and salsa, not complimentary, were at least crunchy but on the greasy side- totally expected.  Guacamole is canned - again, expected.  Bartender was nice enough and she didn't try ramming beers down my throat so a point for that.  All in all a good place to get some drinks, and **very** basic Mexican type foods - I think I would just stick with the greasy chips personally and risk the shits on the plane - you decide."}
{"text":"Had the Chimichurri burger. Got a lot more bread than burger. Not worth the $12 price tag."}
{"text":"Tequileria in Charlotte International Airport was a lively Mexican establishment. The airport party stop for alcoholic drinks and fun foods. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in-between.  I tried to enjoy cranberry juice and hasbrown casserole for breakfast. It was a good, but very light. Also, shredded iceberg and salsa with my morning meal was too weird to actually be acceptable. The culture shock was unreal."}
{"text":"Do not get the barbacoa i had to return it.. NO flavor it is in no way barbacoa it's just frozen shredded beef .. i ordered the fruit plate instead since it did sound good instead I was disappointed again. The service was not the greatest you could tell the bartender did not want to be there... wish I had something good to say about this place sorry but the food was bad"}
{"text":"Cool place for an airport.. My bf and I went here and we each ordered a margarita and shared some chips, salsa and guacamole"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and hit Quiznos or Burger King. The food is only ok and the service is horrible. I wish I would've read the reviews before sitting down for dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas...pricey but they deliver with a good drink.  We tried 1800 on rocks, as well as the mango and banana frozen. Good sized and tasty.  Food was good...tried enchiladas verde, quesadillas & tequila lime chicken.  Good spot to grab a quick preflight drink & bite to eat."}
{"text":"Quick, clean, friendly staff. For a quick bite or a sip of tequila be4 a flight, hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great food and service...had my food in under 20 minute...the chicken nacho were awesome...i would buy them outside of the airport Way overpriced, but isnt everything in airports"}
{"text":"Why didn't I read the reviews first?  There was no hostess or sign saying seat yourself.  I waited a moment and eventually sat.  The waiter took my drink order and didn't ask if I was ready to order.  Then I waited.  Five minutes later he came back with my drink but wasn't ready to take my order.  Eventually I ordered the vegetable tacos with pico.  When food I didn't order arrived, I just decided to cut my losses and gather my belongings and walk out."}
