{"text":"I was a  frequent customer of Midtown Sundries due to the karaoke, wings , festive atmosphere and drink specials. I was disappointed when the business changed to Fanz. Actually I  have only been to Fanz once since it opened to see what the changes were. I was bored and  decided to visit Fanz  on Saturday July the 7th. Well to my surprise Vintage Soul was playing. Their music had an R&B  and jazz flavor. I had never heard of them before but I remained for the entire set 9-12pm they were awesome. The crowd was grown and sexy, there were drink specials and a festive atmosphere! I did not miss the karaoke one bit! How about a cover charge of only $5.00? You can't beat that price! Well Fanz has become my new hangout. I will inform my friends about  the good times you can have at FANZ!!!"}
{"text":"Fanz is a great sports bar to hang out with friends. They have the best wings and great prices on beer. I would recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. We were forced to come here to play an APA pool match and I wish we had forfeited. Service was slow, food mediocre at best, and we couldn't even listen to the jukebox because they were doing over-40 line dancing lessons.  There isn't enough alcohol in the world to tempt me back there. Pool tables are terrible, too.  Nice people, horrible atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beware the heater is broken and I was told by a waitress it has been broken for a long time. The place was freezing, I ate in my coat. The temp outside was 30 and so was the inside."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat on Saturday afternoon and he saw the sign as we drove past. This place used to be Midtown Sundries (we never went there), so we thought we'd check the new place out. The place is HUGE, lots of TVs, a projector, etc. We sat inside, but the outside seating looked very nice too. Everything was clean, and our waiter was very nice. My boyfriend had the $6.99 \"build your own burger\" lunch special. He got a cheeseburger w/ colby jack. The burger was like an inch thick, and he said it tasted good. It came with fries (they were good too). I got the Spinach and Crab dip ($9.99!) and did not like it. It wasn't warm, and i just didn't like the taste of it. I also got the small house salad w/ ranch (your run of the mill lettuce, red onion, croutons, and good ranch). All in all, it was a pretty good experience. We will probably be back, but we won't be getting the Spin/Crab dip."}
{"text":"CLOSED DOWN, no real reason why on note on the door."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I don't know much.  I don't know why this place changed from Midtown Sundries to Fanz. I don't know if the ambiance or clientele has gone downhill.  I don't know about jazz, or live bands and performances.    All I know, is that I have been coming here on Tuesdays for half-priced wings for over six years now, and I have never been disappointed.  I always sit at the bar if space is available, I think you get better, more efficient service at the bar.  The wings have been pretty consistent throughout my time patronizing this place.  I usually switch it up between the Bar.Ba.Low sauce and the smokey BBQ sauce.  Both are delicious on the charred wings dipped in ranch.    I never go here any other time except on Tuesday's (the screens aren't legit enough to go here for sports).  I never order anything other than 10 wings at half price.  I never drink anything other than the $2.50 Yuenling which is also on special on Tuesday nights.    This place is good for what I use it for, cheaply priced, great tasting wings.  Def not a place I would bring to show an out-of-towner the best of Charlotte.  Def not my Friday or Saturday bar of choice either.  Say what you will, but there is no denying the wings at Mid...oops, I mean Fanz ;-)"}
{"text":"Fanz has apparently closed. Maybe 2-3 weeks ago? I can understand why....Not the best sports bar around, mediocre service and OK food."}
{"text":"I was first invited to Fanz by a friend to attend a venue on saturday. This is difinitely a Sports Grill. The food is pretty good. It does get quite crowded on Saturdays. Tuesday is half price wings night and this draws a nice size crowd. The wings are quite tasty. I did go from time to time on Tuesday nights for the wings. They used to have carryout on tuesday night and has since discontinued it. Not one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Last Tuesday we went there and the place was empty! I tried to see if they were closed from a bad inspection and there is no indication of it, the phone still has a message stating hours and such as if they are still in business, maybe they are remodeling? http://charmeck.org/MECKLENBURG/COUNTY/HEALTHDEPARTMENT/FODDFACILITIES/Pages/default.aspx"}
{"text":"Well after tromping around Davidson with a friend, she said lets go listen to some jazz... Well she had me at Jazz and I was excited to find a small venue to listen to some music... Well, this is NOT a small venue and the jazz was more like smooth jazz -- don't get me wrong, the musicians were good, but not great.   This place is a sports bar, clearly a sports bar... huge and not so cozy. The crowd wasn't my scene and I probably wouldn't go back, well I wouldn't on my own, but if my friend asked me to join her again, I'd think long and hard on whether or not it would be worth the drive.   I ordered a dirty martini... meh me NO think so... it was gross -- and come on... how can one ruin a dirty martini, but then again, I'm sure the frequency of martini drinker here must be little to none. For my second beer I opted for this blueberry beer... and that was yummy.   I guess they are known for their wings, but I doubt I'd go back just to try them. But the what the hell... at least I know now... the Fanz ain't a place for me, yo!"}
