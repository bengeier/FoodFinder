{"text":"Best shawarma in town. Tasty, good portions, friendly service. I like this place, Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went in today to buy a chicken shawarma plate, service was average. The food looked like it had been sitting there for awhile but I gave them the benefit of doubt. Definitely don't be purchasing from them again, my second time and again not a good experience. The food was cold and unfresh. The garlic butter is not garlic butter; extremely salty. The chicken texture is off and overall the taste of the whole platter is extremely salty and tasteless. The guy gave me two potatoes only, it's a platter. For 11$ this was so not worth it. I would not go back."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma resembled pan fried chicken breast more than actual shawarma. Portions were very small and the server seemed to count the scoops of rice and salad nervously like he was measuring medicine. Extremely unappealing. I will not be coming back! These guys need to change their name because they are nowhere close to being a  \"Shawarma King\"."}
{"text":"I have been on a search for good shwarma ever since moving from Ottawa to Toronto six years ago. Anyone who has lived/had drunken nights in Ottawa knows the glory of their abundant and garlic-ridden shwarma places, and I have yet to find anything that comes close to replicating the Ottawa shwarma experience in Toronto (including this place).  I got a chicken shwarma. The meat was good, toppings were pretty standard, although points because they let you add tabouleh for no extra charge (a lot of places charge 25 or 50 cents). Also got to try a some of the beef, which was not nearly as good as the chicken, and had a bit of an 'off' spice to it. In terms of what you get for the price I would say this place is on par with somewhere like Ali Babas.  I should note the guy who served me was great. It was slow, but he was very attentive and delivered a well put together shwarma.  My hopes were high when I came into \"Shwarma King\", since the \"Shwarma King\" in Ottawa (Bank St.) is my number one. Even though I doubted it, a little bit of me was hoping they had some relation...they definitely don't, and my search for ottawa-style shwarma continues..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful. Nothing about is fresh, and the meat is some sort of synthetic byproduct. Gross."}
{"text":"Chicken overcooked. Better to warm it on a flat grill when the customer is there. Food is kinda flavourless. Could do way better. Also, smiling helps :) BUt not a must.. This is my third visit here. Likely last"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. It was the smallest shwarma I've ever had for 8 bucks and it was soggy and nasty."}
{"text":"The worse shawarma I have ever had in my life. I had raw meat, the hummus us very liquid, no hygiene, it's just terrible. Never going again."}
{"text":"I have established a pattern of eating here.  The shwarma are pretty good. Not the best but pretty good.  I love their veggie plate. I recommend people to try it.  The only bad experience I had was when I new guy working there didnt give me my caulifower."}
{"text":"not bad, i like that their potatoes are not deep fried and full of grease, the trio is pretty good. I use to live in ottawa though so I have high standards for schawarma. Its ok..."}
{"text":"I visited Shawarma King not too long ago in desperate want for a shawarma. When I walked I was completely unsure of where to order so I kinda just stood there and got a couple of dirty looks from the employes until they finally took my order. It was all disorganized, and got a bit frustrating. But as soon as I tried my shawarma... I was in heaven it was soo good. As a garlic lover I really appreciated that they put extra garlic on my potato side. Overall I would come back again to that place because the shawarma was great in taste and quality, I would just get it to go!"}
{"text":"I have loved shawarma since I was a high school kid in Ottawa who loved the shawarma in Hull at 3 a.m. after a night of clubbing in the 1980s.  I've tried many places in Toronto, and Shawarma's King remains my favourite in this city.  I have been going here since the old days when they were located in the Eaton Centre.  The meat is very good, as are the sides.  I might not be an expert on the cuisine of the eastern Mediterranean, but this place consistently has (in my opinion) the tastiest shawarma I can find.  Every time that I see online reviews recommending a shawarma place elsewhere in Toronto as being \"the best\" or \"authentic\", I try it and usually like it, but it is never quite as good as Shawarma's King."}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't bother. Food is luke warm, old, fruit flies flying around the food. Atmosphere is gross and dirty.   Been here 3 times with no change in opinion. Will not return."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst shawarma I have ever had ( I have had many!!). It's a lazy attempt at shawarma. Salty, Soggy and flavourless. Not authentic and you can certainly find better options. On another note the service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"It was ok. I went in because it was open New Year's Eve at around 8pm and I was hungry on my way to a NYE party. I had the beef shawarma sandwich which was ok, a bit bland, but all in all ok.   Some guy tried to steal my soda by putting down his empty on my tray when he thought I had my back turned so you might want to keep your eyes on your stuff.  All in all, go in here if you have to when nothing else is open"}
{"text":"I like their Shawarma is so juicy and tender. It has a special taste with a touch if lemon taste with i love it, it so mouth watering. Good customer service. So many varieties of food and all fresh and delious. They also gave fresh juices such as orange, carrot, etc. highly recommanded!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheap chicken shawarma wrap for under $6. Service was very quick, but it's probably one of the most disappointing shawarma's I've ever had in Toronto!  It was thinly filled. The chicken wasn't crispy or savoury. It was tasteless, bland, and nearly undercooked. Moreover, the one guy who worked there didn't even ask if you wanted it grilled (which I'm pretty sure every place does), which made the wrap's texture too soft for me.  Only about 3-4 chairs for sitting. Very humid and packed inside.  Verdict: Wouldn't come back here again! I've experienced much better elsewhere. Decent choice only if you're in a rush for lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. This was the worst shawarma I have ever had. 5.99 for a tiny chicken shawarma that made me sick for 2 days. I should have clued in when the guy making it was an ass because I asked for more than one piece of turnip. Never come here. The McDonald's filled with cracker jacks across the street is a safer bet."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Meat was dry, sauces lacked flavour, wrap was dry.  The 1-star is particular for the poor service. Staff were rude and made up answers to our questions. When we asked more than one staff member the same question, we received a different answer. Just a buncha liars.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I grab lunch here once a week, and they are just so nice. I always get called honey or sweetie by the woman who works the cash, and they will happily give you extra garlic sauce. I usually get the shwarma plate (either chicken or beef) and occasionally it will be a little dry but is usually quite good, with fresh salad and rice and potatoes, and a fresh pita bread (which are delicious).  They have a good selection of dishes, serve customers quickly, and are reasonably priced. Not a high-end dinner/date night place by any means but should be a go-to take-out spot for anyone who digs Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Horrible nickel-and-diming service. I live in the area and pop by for a meal ever so often. I pretty much order the same dish every time I go which is the grilled chicken dish ($7.99) Depending on the person behind the counter,  I either get charged extra or not for different rice or salad. Horribly inconsistent and they seem to make up additional charges on the spot.   The food is quite good though, especially that grilled chicken leg. The shawarma is not the best in the city, but is quite good. I'd rate it higher if it were not for the service that really dampens the experience."}
{"text":"I hit this place on a good day and the shwarma platter (9.99) was quite filling. The salad was fresh and it came loaded with tahini and hummus on top. Only problem was my server covered the whole thing in hot sauce....  Decor and the whole place could use a bit of an investment."}
{"text":"A decent little hole in the wall shwarma and kebab place on King street. No seating. Very Friendly service. Most affordable option on King and a nice place if you need a snack before a Blue Jays game."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite. Ordered a shawarma pita, potatoes and a drink. The guy tried to charge me the price for individuals instead of the combo deal then looked at me funny when I said it's a combo. There were 5 pieces of potato in the container, which was less than a third full. About 30 seconds after leaving the restaurant there was garlic sauce streaming through the bottom of the bag al over my clothes. It turns out the potato container was put sideways, opening side down into the bag with the lacklustre shawarma. In summary a barely average shawarma, decent but skimpy potatoes, and poor staff.  Give it a miss"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer of Shawarma's King from the time they had a tiny location at the lower level of the Eaton Centre. After a long wait they opened this location which fortunately still remains within walking  distance of my work.   Anyway, I was really surprised to read some of the negative reviews here. I've tried quite a few different places for shawarma and this is by far my favourite. I usually order them chicken shawarma plate that packs a punch due to its sheer size. I'm not sure how much the plate weights but for those with a big appetite like me it's one of the $10 you'll spend anywhere! The plate can be tailored to your taste buds, with three choices of rice (you pay extra for the rice with lentils), two different types of salad (garden or cabbage), you get a couple of baked potatoes and it's your choice whether you want garlic or hot sauce (or none) and salad dressing (or none). So, if you complain that there's too much of one or the other, we'll, you got no one to blame but yourself...   Also, I've know Ali (the owner), Mariann (who works as the cashier too) and some of the other staff and they have ALWAYS been very polite and helpful. On my last visit I saw Maryann give free food to a senior who claimed she had forgotten her wallet... They've ALWAYS served me with a smile, given me plenty of food while ensuring that the plate was to my liking.   I suggest that those who had a problem with the food and/or service here give it a try again and speak up. Talk to the staff and mention your concerns, it's a much more effective way of getting them to improve and have the food and service to YOUR liking."}
{"text":"Pretty good dish! The shrawma was pretty chewy. The rice and salad we're good. I felt it was a lot in a plate since it also came with potatoes, so I wasn't able to finish. Will probably skip the potatoes next time. The place itself is definitely a touch and go, not somewhere you wanna hang too long. The people who work there was nice, but the one taking my order kinda assumed Ive been there before, and got irritated when I didn't know how to order."}
{"text":"Discovered this place again after they moved from Eaton Centre.  Female cashier is the same as old location and one other guy with salt & pepper mustache.  However there is a young guy there with beard who has major attitude and refuses to serve you if your not Persian or white.  He will see you enter and then walk away to the back..it is so blatant and obvious.  For this reason I will take my business to Paramount."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Do not go here. The meat tastes terrible, like its 2 days old or something and waaaay over cooked. We tried both the chicken and beef and both terrible. The chicken was less bad though. I had to pull the meat out of my sandwich and eat the vegetables."}
{"text":"The place looks unhygienic and the food tasted awful and stale..gave me food poisoning...Don't risk your health. I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The service is awful and the amount and quality of food that you get is not good either. There's a bloke older than the others. He has a moustache and I believe he is the owner. He was the one who offered us an absolutely rubbish service, we have never been treated like that before."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. Dont eat here service is unbelievably terrible, food is horrible and disgusting.   Went into the store around 9pm on a Saturday with three of my friends. I asked for a beef Shawarma and paid for it. I sat down and it took me only one bite to realize that it wasnt even cooked meat. I call it meat because I dont even think it was beef. Looked and tasted more like dog food. (Not that i know what dog food tastes like... but i think i do now.)  I spoke to the person that made my dog food as well as the person at the register and told them that something was wrong with the meat and i would like a veggie shawarma instead. They refused to make a new shawarma or give me my money back.   If you like eating shit and being disrespected than come to Shawarma king and have a blast!"}
{"text":"Tried to go to Osmow's and ended up here. The only way to eat it was to wash it down with lots of water. They couldn't even get to stuffed grape leaf right. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Lucky for Monday, there's a special on the falafel trio.   Combo includes falafel on a pita, a drink, and a side of deliciously seasoned potatoes.    It's somewhat of a pet peeve when I see the falafel is already pre cooked and sitting in display.  I like to see it prepared before my eyes like most places.  It was still pretty good but not as flavourful as one would expect.    This place receives a fair amount of traffic during the lunch hour, but I wouldn't be dying to come back anytime soon.    Staff are nice enough and prompt to serve."}
{"text":"Will not become my regular place, but I found a parking spot. Good potatoes.  On an impulse decided to have lunch here. A simple combo of a beef shawarma, with roasted potatoes, and a cola.  The shawarma was OK, but certainly disapointing coming from a \"king\". The filling in the pita was very skimpy and rolled carelessly. The potatoes were b asked and dredged in spices with a small glob of garlic mayonnaise spooned on top. They were just OK.   Overall there are far better and cheaper places. Certainly not the Shawarma King."}
{"text":"I don't always eat shawarma, but when I do I eat it at Shawarmas King. The man behind the counter said it's the best beef in the city and I'm inclined to believe him. The beef sandwich was full of flavor and melted in my mouth. The experience of eating it brought me the greatest pleasure I had experienced all day. The potatoes that rounded out the combo meal had a delicate spice that was just enough to let you know it was there but not enough to nag you after you took a bite of that delicious sandwich that was in my hand. Me and my taste buds are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I got the beef shawarma lunch plate. I have been here a couple times, it is mostly takeout style, it is a small place. Beef shawarma comes with rice and salad, humus, garlic sauce and a small pita. For the taste I would give 4 stars, but for the price 3 stars. With tax it is 11+ dollars, which is pricey for take out place with this type of food. Service is fast, there is a short libe up during lunch time."}
{"text":"I went here with my brother, he couldn't even eat his food, he left it, chicken was warm and not even fresh, food including salad seemed mushy. For the high price you assume you are going to get good food, not impressed at all. Sad showing by this place. Not worth going at all with the large selection of other places to go."}
{"text":"doesn't live up to the name Shawarma King. I received a lazily wrapped shawarma (which juice quickly proceeded to leak out of and was only given one napkin. so things got very messy). went here on a whim because I was craving shawarma and it was close by but I will not be visiting it again."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hate. This place is easily one of the best shawarma in the city. The meat is seasoned so well and I have never had beef shawarma so tender.   I would recommend the mixed plate that has chicken and beef shawarma with rice, salad, potatoes and an authentic pita."}
{"text":"This place has turned me into a chicken shawarma lover. I just get the sandwich but you can also get it with a side of potatoes with their garlic sauce (which are both very tasty) or as a plate with rice and salad. The falafels have also been hit with all of my vegetarian friends that I've brought here."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. The wrap was average but the potatoes were room temperature and hard and chewy on the outside.   The prices are not great either."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  I don't understand why you would go to the trouble of opening a restaurant, call yourself the King of something, and then serve lazy, subpar food.  I was walking by and couldn't help but notice a very impressive-looking spit covered in delicious-seeming meat, so I stopped in and ordered a chicken shawarma wrap. I guess my first indication that things were not going to turn out well was the clerk grabbing pieces of already-cut chicken from a tray underneath the aforementioned spit.  Doesn't it go without saying that the whole point of shawarma are those crispy bits you get from meat that's been cooking for a while? Why even use the spit if you're not going to do that?  Anyway, it goes without saying that the wrap was a soggy mess. None of the toppings stood out and the whole thing just tasted of a chicken-flavored mush.  You are the king of nothing, Shawarma's King. Abdicate your throne."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot, and I happy I did.  I had the beef shawarma combo for 7.99 which included a pop and some taste potatoes. Food was taste, however a little to much cilantro in the shawarma, next time I will make sure to ask for less. The potatoes were delicious, glad I took the recommendation of the potatoes from the friendly cashier lady.  Quick and nice service, ill be back soon."}
{"text":"For 7 bucks bot a bad shawarma I definitely tried better places  but the positive is they do make it very quickly and made to order which is great."}
{"text":"Truly the King (on Queen). Simple, delicious and well priced. Though there are two options close to me I always walk out of my way to get real Shwarmas.   Service is always engaging (they speak a few languages) and professional."}
{"text":"Overall, overpriced for what it is. The rice tastes oily and leftover for many days. The beef has no flavour to it. But the salads are quite delightful. Staff are very friendly too."}
{"text":"The WORST shawarma I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was off and by off I mean rotten.  I bought a combo and asked what came with it and was told a drink and sandwich but they did not advise that you get some kind of potato with garlic sauce.  Cashier told me the price, I gave him money but he did not give me change which I promptly said you still need to give me change and he looked at me like the tip was mandatory.  Let's just say I will never come back EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Small, cramped, and awkward. I ordered a chicken shawarma which was small, bland, and featured an odd tasting sauce.  Only went here because I was attending a concert at Roy Thomson Hall and there was nothing else in the immediate area. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"My complaint about this shawarma parlour is not the quality of the meat or pita. So, on that I disagree with the other reviewers. I did not experience any cartilage or even fat in my shawarma. Those were good and win this location stars. What I did not like was the small sandwich size. Four bites and you are done. Also, the debit machine, fridge door and floor are all dirty. The narrow narrow take-out shop needs a big spring cleaning. Finally, queue is out of the door. Business opportunity: a shawarma shop in the Financial District. Do you hear me Uncle Tetsu?"}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma wrap and was pleasantly surprised by how good the chicken tasted. Only negative is that it was a little too oily."}
{"text":"Shawarma King has been in business for over 25 years and employees working there for over 18 years and serving regulars since the day they opened,   The pricing is definitely fair for the servings and how generous they are with the food  The beef shawarma plate or the chicken shawarma a plate are definite go to's ,  The tabouli it's fresh and to die for the felafel is amazing and made fresh every day.   The staff is friendly The lady helping me was all smiles and out of her way to explain anything and help put together my delicious combos , behind the scenes the culinary expert have 50 years of culinary expertise   The chicken and beef shish kebab very delicious and popular . They also make natural fresh juice on site. I really enjoyed the zaatar The crust and go melted in my mouth !   This is a Toronto staple and if you are visiting Toronto or want to try traditional Halal Shawarma King is the place to go"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my chicken shwarma dinner here.   Tasty chicken, rice, potatoes, pita, and all the standards.    Potatoes had slightly unique dry spice/herbs on them.  Also good.  Across the street from Henry's.   I would go back."}
{"text":"Line up out the door because its TIFF. Had both the beef and chicken shawarma sandwiches. They were both just okay. Not sure what the beef grade is, but it is definitely low. I liked the chicken more, but both were just okay. Plus there didn't seem to be much sauce on it."}
{"text":"The WORST shawarma I've ever had! They actually said \"are you sure you want potatoes? They're pretty old\". The chicken wasn't even cooked. Bad bad bad."}
{"text":"This newly opened Shwarma King has a bah humbug attitude towards serving people. Their menu consisting of shwarmas, shwarma plates and juices is nothing mind blowing. However, their offerings of cold potatoes, meh hummus, underwhelming proteins, and dour service is spectacularly unappetizing. Their credit/debit machine is perpetually slow. If this  is the state of affairs at this nascent stage, I am not very optimistic about their bucking the curse of this particular location. But good luck to Shwarma King to get the kinks sorted out. May its reign be long and successful!"}
{"text":"Having just opened across the street from where I work, I felt obligated to try Shawarma's King out. They have a decent shawarma, however, there's nothing incredibly special about it. It tastes good, and fills me up.  I did order the Shawarma plate once, and while delicious, there was quite a bit of sauces added to it, which did lead to a bit of a mess.  Overall though, I do visit when I have a craving, as it is close and good."}
{"text":"Shawarma was on the smaller side. Its really not that great, but what it is, is super convenient. If you're out in the area or if you are wrapping up a night out, its easy to pop in and grab a quick bite.   Nowhere near the greatest shawarma, but atleast its not sickeningly bad."}
{"text":"Co worker said this is a good place for a quick bite. He was right about the quick part. The chicken shawarma sandwich was okay but nothing special, then I got a nice strong bite of cartilage which ended whatever enjoyment I had left.   Might give this place another shot later if my co worker drags me here. Too bad, the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy my chicken shawarma when I came here. My pita was squished so much it burst - a total mess especially considering how little was actually in my sandwich. The chicken had a very strange texture and my stomach was upset the rest of the afternoon :(."}
{"text":"Standard, average shwarma. Nothing to get excited about, other than the price is fair. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"I had a chicken shawarma wrap with all the fixings and found it very disappointing. Although Shawarma King is very clean and the women who served me was nice enough (hence the 2 stars) at $6.50 I probably won't return as there are better options in the area.   I arrived before the lunch rush (around 11am) which should mean I'm getting the best/freshest, instead the food tasted like it was from the end of the day and catered towards people who don't like flavour. The white meat chicken was very dry and under seasoned, the garlic sauce was watery, the hot sauce lacked heat, and the toppings weren't fresh which is especially disappointing when it involves defrosted tomatoes during summertime. The shawarma wasn't even wrapped correctly which resulted in an extremely messy eat even by shawarma standards. How can a wrap be both very dry and a soupy mess at the same time?!   I doubt the 5 star reviewers here have had good shawarma before."}
{"text":"Another nice shwarma place, pretty standard. One of those places that just asks you if you want hot sauce, though maybe you can choose what you want on your Shwarma. Shwarma was quite good, chicken was flavourful and sauces were nice. I still think 6.75 (5.99+tax) is a bit high for chicken-on-a-pita but it's a standard price by now.  The guy asked me if I wanted it for here or to go. As the place was tiny and there were no seats, I opted for takeout."}
{"text":"\"to be the man, you have to beat the man\" or to become a king? i was excited to try this place, as i am always traveling in and around this neighborhood, and great places to eat are always serve purpose when your stranded for ideas.  the only redeeming factor about this place is that the food is cheap...no really, its cheap.  the place is pretty dirty, the restaurant looks like it hasn't done an upgrade since the 90's(or whenever it was opened). when i ordered my shwarma, as it was being prepared, it looked to be that 6 toppings were offered, with three sauces.  upon receiving my food to eat, the meat tasted very plain, no seasonings to speak of.   in short, the food is cheap...cause its really cheap... im pretty sure i would walk across the street to mcds instead...and thats saying alot"}
