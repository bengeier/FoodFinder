{"text":"Food was excellent...2 stars because the service was not so great & waitress a bit rude as she asked us to clean the table where she seated us by dumping some napkins in front of us!  No matter how busy the place is, this kind of treatment is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week - this shows how much we LOVE Pho Mymy! Read our blog post about it :) http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/10/18/pho-mymy-good-fast-inexpensive/ - The Forbidden Meal"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you're a vegetarian because one does not get their money's worth in terms of how much meat is  actually included in their meals.   Long story short, I ordered grilled chicken on rice and ended up with 2 meager maryland fillets which only a preteen would consider a proper serving size of meat.   Anyway, i asked for extra meat which they charge an extra 4$ for and received 2 additional fillets which were very small and sliced paper thin. Needless to say it cost me about 20$ and had to get food from accross the street just to feel full which is not great value at all for a vietnamese place.   For the record i am by no means a large human being standing 5\"9 and weighting 165"}
{"text":"Deux premières visites c'était très bon. J'avais impression d'être dans une de mes endroits préférés de Montréal. Mais tout lorsque je suis aller la troisième fois c'est gâcher. Les rouleaux était correct rien de sorcier !!! La soupe était sans goût ça goûtais les légumes congelés. Le sauté de mon amie était sans goût aussi !!! Vraiment déçu de cette visite perte de temps pertes argent."}
{"text":"Very good Pho soup, friendly service and a clean and simple place. I'm adopting this place, greatly needed in the area. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place's l'Acadie location a few times over from friends and read  good reviews here. I was hesitant to give it a try bcs after trying other similar joints and leaving with bad taste in my mouth, I jumped onto this wagon called \"Generalization\" and started judging the rest of the 793 pho places in and around the city as mediocre. Except for 2 or 3 on my fav list of course. It's easier to do so than keep taking risks by trying new places until you find a real contender ha? Nice thinking Harry, noice.   So this third branch of MyMy opened up two months ago as per our waiter and from the looks of it, the client base is not too shabby. We arrived at 5pm, it's Saturday and sure lots of people are still busy digging out of the almost 30cm white crap we just got or plain tired of moving it around. Despite the fact, the place had decent traffic. Lots of folks came and left with take outs which should be counted in the picture. This place will rock and gain popularity pretty soon I think.   Now onto the Pho itself..... wohaaa! Was I blown away by its super good quality and taste or what? Seriously? Did I just finish an XL dac biet and enjoyed every single slurp of it and I haven't left my hood of Laval yet? Can't be but it did happen. Man am I glad that I don't have to travel far for Pho anymore. Yesss!   People, you have to come here for the Pho and Pho only. I tried their spring roll and fried banana.... can't say awesome; stick with the Pho I said. But please, don't come and judge the place for its super bland decor (the blandest I've seen in my life) along with zero ambiance and uninspired customer service. They don't have these to offer in order for you to feel like a special snowflake but I guarantee you that you'll leave extremely satisfied with their superb Pho.   Here! Take my money and 5 stars. Looks like I'll be coming here often to satisfy my Pho addiction from now on."}
{"text":"Homemade stock has a deeper and richer flavor than anything you can normally find at restaurants. Normally it takes a 12-18 hours of simmering before the magic can be infused into a good hearty bowl of \"Pho\". At Mymy, they've got it right and definitely do justice to what one would call a real traditional Vietnamese beef and noodle soup!  Good, fast and not expensive, your bowl of pho will come with a fresh pot of jasmine tea and an assortment of fresh herbs including Asian Basil, Bean Sprouts, Spicy Hot Pepper and also surprisingly \"Ngo Gai\" aka culantro - very few place serve this tangy herb!  The menu is simple but offers all the staples including spring rolls, imperials rolls, shrimp tempura, vermicelli or rice dishes with choice of grilled chicken, pork or beef brochettes, pork chops, shrimp, or a combination of your choice. Also available is crispy noodles and choice of bean dessert, fried banana or fried pineapple.  Pssst. Ask for the spicy beef soup called \"Bun Bo Hue\". It's not on the menu but I'm sure you'll love it!   Mymy is located on l'Acadie opposite of Marche Central and not two far from the Rockland Shopping Center. The place is small and cozy so if you're planning a trip with a big group, do call ahead.   You know it's good pho when a group of 16+ Vietnamese come in on a Sunday evening. I'd love to hear from your experience!"}
{"text":"Service is fast but I was left hungry after the shrimp vermicelli $12.50. The shrimp did not have a taste, it was probably pretty cooked and frozen. Not vegetarian friendly. Even the spring rolls all have meat. My friend ordered the XL photo and said it was a good Noodle to meat ratio. Debit and cash only."}
{"text":"Came by Sunday afternoon for pho, the place is casual and quite full from the time we got there until we left, surprising as it was late into the afternoon already.   The soup had clarity and flavour which I enjoyed, the noodles were chewy and not mushy, and the toppings were acceptable. Nothing to rave about, but a solid bowl of pho for a reasonable price. The large size makes for a filling meal, maybe even too much if you have a small stomach.  The grilled chicken spring rolls were not bad, comes in sets of two. They had all the expected contents, nothing to rave or complain about.  All in all, nothing disappointing but nothing amazing either. I would return based on its convenient location across from the Marché centrale, Costco, and proximity to Bloc Shop."}
{"text":"I was in the hood that I grew up, with 2 of my realest G. We were hungry so we decided to flip a coin to go either to Nostos or this cozy spot that I've never been. Thank God it ended on tails. This place was super good nd very cheap $ wise. Had the #7 pho amazingggggg. No disrespect for Nostos tho good place 2, nxt time fam. Happy and filled customer here. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent pho in an understated setting. Very clean and great broth / flavours. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok mise à jour -_- je retire une étoile ! La soupe pho épicé au buf ne goûte plus du tout comme avant ! Je ne sais pas ce qu'ils ont fait mais ce n'est plus comme avant et c'est beaucoup moins bon..... s'il vous plaît revenez à votre ancienne formule pour la soupe épicé au buf !!!!!!!! :((((    Enfin une deuxième succursale et en plus à laval ! Vraiment contente car j'adore leur soupe Pho. Jusqu'à présent c'est celle que je préfère !!!!!"}
{"text":"J'aurais donné 3* à ce Pho si ce n'était du service qui manque férocement de politesse et de courtoisie.  Pas un bonjour, pas un merci en quittant ni même un sourire!  En plus le serveur a rajouté des serviettes dans le \"dispenser\" pendant mon repas, sans dire un mot, en passant par dessus mon bol. Il n'était même pas vide! Les rouleaux de printemps sont  minuscules, pas remplis et le choix des garnitures est décevant. Pas d'herbes fraîches et des carottes marinées, ce qui rend le rouleau trop vinaigré, surtout servi avec la sauce pour rouleaux frits.  Le bouillon est bof; un peu acide et plutôt gras. Ça manque de profondeur. Je n'ai pas pu finir le petit format.  Bref, je ne recommande pas cet endroit, déception"}
{"text":"One of my favourite phos in town! The \"bunh bo Huey\" is amazing and definitely the main reason to visit. Perfectly spicy and tart broth, meat tastes fresh and tender.  The chicken phos are alright but nothing compared to the bunch bo huey. Don't expect traditional wait service or a nice atmosphere because you're not going to find it here. It's a tiny restaurant in a strip mall with maybe enough seats for 25 people but the pho is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"No BS place where you can get good decent Vietnamese food. I had their excellent Spicy Tonkinese Noodle (Pho) Soup, a huge bowl with garnish on the side...my new death row meal. Lunch time...place was packed with locals and Vietnamese, what does that tell you?"}
{"text":"I really think this is the best place for bun bo hue! Out of all the Vietnamese places I've tried for this specific dish, MyMy is the most satisfying. And I knew I did the right thing by ordering it because a lot of people in my proximity was eating that dish I so was desperately wanting to try. Once I got it, oh boy...bun bo hue heaven! For those who don't happen to know bun bo hue is, it's a spicy beef noodle soup with a usually orangey colored broth. It's spicy, but not deathly spicy I'd say. (but if you can't handle spicy at all, maybe opt out!) I personally like it because it's super flavorful and has got a nice kick to it. I also happen to like the thicker noodles they use for this soup too.  I also ordered the rainbow 3 color drink which was excellent! It was bit of longer wait for the food, probably because it was busy but other than that no complaints. I'd come back again to try the pho...or maybe get the same thing again!"}
{"text":"Excellent little spot on l'Acadie. Tight little wobbly tables full of hungry customers. Working class lunch patrons. Cash and debit only. On a cold Montréal day the smell of the Pho broth fills the place. I had the meat on vermicelli with a wonton soup. All excellent. Friendly quick staff serves with a smile. Filled my frozen gut with warm tasty food. Coming back for the real Pho and not the faux Pho. Ouch."}
{"text":"The place is very clean!and bun Bo hue is good ,service is fast...compare with pho nam quan,I like here than nam quan..."}
{"text":"I am strictly reviewing on the Bun bo hue. I've tried the pho but not enough to be too critical with it. I tasted the broth of the pho and it was okay. The spring rolls are decent, but if you are expecting meat in them, there isnt much.  Bun Bo hue: it is very good. I like the variety of meats in it, the medium to fatty meat and then the viet sausages. Koodos to the plate representation too! I love the broth, its so soothing and warm, flavourful. Noodles are not overcooked which is important in a noodle soup. Good amount of herbs. Overall I enjoy their bun bo hue very much, I usually go there only for that nothing else."}
{"text":"Ate 2 times in this resto, very disappointed.  Pho broth was taste just like water.  Never come back again."}
{"text":"The soup tastes a bit weird and we got so thirsty after. It occurs to me whenever they use excessive MSG.   My favourite pho place goes to Chez Lien. Cheaper and better taste."}
{"text":"Aujourd'hui est le jour d'ouverture et je l'attendais depuis un bon moment parce qu'à Laval les bonnes place de pho sont rares. Ma première impression est très bonne. La pho est bien structuré, les accompagnements sont frais est en bonne quantité. Le menu est classique d'un resto vietnamien. Les prix sont exactement ce à quoi on s'attend pour ce type de restaurant. Malgré qu'il reste quelques petits détails de finition (interact ne fonctionne pas encore) je m'attendais à pire comme service car souvent lors d'ouvertures les employés sont désorganisés. Ici tout va bien et je recommande Pho Mymy à tout ceux qui savent ce qu'un bon resto de pho devrait être et qui sont tanné des imitations à Laval!"}
{"text":"Malheureusement, il y a eu un changement de propriétaire et de cuisinier...je ne recommande plus cet endroit.  Pâle copie de ce qui est vraiment une bonne soupe...comme la plupart des resto dite de cuisine vietnamienne."}
{"text":"Je viens (grâce a Yelp) de découvrir ce petit bijou... La PH? Boeuf et tendon est excellente, le bouillon est parfait et le service y est rapide et courtois... Je vais y retourner c'est vertIn..."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Very clean. Pho is better than most other Vietnamese restaurants we have been to in Montreal, although the soup is still kinda plain. The meat in the pho is quite tender, though the tendon could have been softer. Overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times to consider myself a regular. Really happy they're now located in Laval as we sorely needed a real Vietnamese option in the area. I've been to their original location many times so imagine my happiness when I drove by and saw their new sign.  Their Pho Bac Diet soup is the real deal. Warm, generous portion packed with flavor. Excellent to clear up the sinuses with some spicy sauce inside. Totally amazing on a crappy winter day.  Their chicken/beef vermicelli bowl is decent but really not the best they offer and I'll admit I'd had it better elsewhere. This bowl however lacks the generous portions they offer with their soups.  Great price-tag and a great option for lunch. Service is decent and this place sure is busy! Will be back, Pho sure."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a really nice 'Bun bo Hue' here. As someone who doesn't take too spicy I found it to the limit of my palette. It was delicious however and I stayed the course! Homemade stock with rich flavors are always a good thing.  :)  Soup portion is huge and I certainly would come back for it. Price-tag is very reasonable.  Minus 1 star for the service, which was somewhat blunt."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I don't know why this place received such high ratings. I was so looking forward to trying the bun bo hue after reading the reviews. What a disappointment. It had an odd taste.  Didn't quite taste right and I've had lots of bun bo hue in my life. I was soooo thirsty after eating there and had a bad headache. Service was ok.   They should update their attributes on Yelp. It states they accept credit cards, but they don't.  Cash and debit only.  On top of everything else, parking was atrocious.   I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very nice dinner here and was happy to find a new Viet resto to add to the arsenal!  I noticed this one day in which I was driving back from Marche Central.  Restaurant is smaller and setup in a true Vietnamese quick and casual style!  You know by the stack of chopsticks on the table and Chinese soup spoons stacked upside down that this is not your \"Quebec Vietnamese stir fry\"!    They have a great simple menu with many items sub $10 and a few others that are sub $15.  This is my kind of place!    I ordered the #28 chicken, beef and pork with noodles.  It came out very nice on a plate with salad + I ordered the Imperial rolls.  Imperial rolls were a bit smaller but tasty none the less!  Food was tasty and with my brother's dinner it was $31(with a 15% tip added in).    Although L'acadie is high volume traffic (NYC Style) I'll come back to test out the Pho!"}
{"text":"For ten years I've yearned for some real deal Vietnamese food near my home. It's a shame that the true ethnic food joints tend to stay closer to the city centre. However it is a positive that Pho Mymy seems to be expanding to multiple locations. I have visited the Pho Mymy location near Marche Central years ago and it's a solid offering. Here in Laval they have created a successful restaurant in a short period of time. On my two visits it's been packed at lunch on both visits. This is a good sign. One of my assumptions of the popularity is because you can get a solid lunch for $12-15 with tax and tap included. If you go with one of their combos with soup and spring roll it will run you $17-19. Another plus is they understand the essence of a quicker lunch. Most folks have max an hour and they work to be able to get you in and out wth a big plate of deliciousness. Or a big bowl of pho in quick efficient manner.  Visit one I had the grilled chicken Vermicelli with spring roll with soup cup and two small spring rolls. It's a big lunch! They brought out the noodles on a plate and I asked kindly if they would put it in a bowl which they cordially did. Taste and freshness was excellent.   Visit two it was Bún Bò hu?. Although not as spicy as other places it was hearty with some Vietnamese sausage and a thinly slicked brisket plus a few fatty pieces. The broth was a nice beef flavour and very generous serving.   During my second visit I was explaining to My wife could you smell the star anise of the pho broth! Amazing!   I deduct one star as they do not accept credit card. Cash or interac only. A small inconvenience however food is awesome!   I read the other reviews and sorry for the Yelper who claimed they got food poisoning. No issues for me. I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"So so for the Viêt foods. Bon bo hue soup not very tasty missing something. Mtl blog recommandation not very sure."}
{"text":"Overall it was a pleasant experience, the decor was simple, clean and a lot nicer than most tonkinese soup places. The pho and bun bo hue were well made but the imperial rolls we smaller than commonly serve size. Good place to go if u wanna shop in Rockland center and feel for a soup :)"}
{"text":"It's a good and cozy place to have a bowl of pho. It tasted slightly different of the usual bowls I order in Chinatown. I dont know what tasted different, but it wasn't bad. Though there was a lack of flavour on the bun bo hue, the portions were good."}
{"text":"Out of all the pho restaurants i've tried in laval, this place is the best! Recently renovated, the soup base for pho dac biet is really good. Not too salty like other restaurants who just fill the soup base with MSG. As one of the newly opened pho restaurants, it's one of the contenders for best vietnamese pho in laval. Authentic, natural taste, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Tried the highly recommended bun bo hue for take-out. It's very tasty and delicious. Just can't imagine how better it could be. Definitely on my take-out list."}
{"text":"Finally, a Pho Mymy spot in Laval! More space, open everyday and the Pho was consistent as always"}
{"text":"Good place for a pho.  Came to this place with my parents several times,   Soup is rich and tasty,  Their spring roll is fresh, but sometimes not.  I like it. They give a big portion too just like other places."}
{"text":"Delicious bun bo hue. I like the pho too. I find it has less msg then most other places, it tastes clean and no frills. The imperial rolls are OK. The spring rolls have their good days and ok days. The grilled chicken vermicelli is good. The pork and beef are stingy on the meats portion. I love their salty lemon drinks. Also love their red bean drinks. Most of all, love that theyre very family and kid friendly. Will pass you bowls and scissors for your little one. And for an Asian resto, they actually have a Changing table in the women's bathroom even if it's just a table from Ikea. Clean facilities. We go often."}
{"text":"Great place! Serves yummy dishes and never disappoints! Would recommend the pho to anyone. Brought a few friends to this resto, and they end up loving it as well! Would definately recommend to anyone craving Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho, unpretentious atmosphere, friendly service, generous portion. I'll definitely include this place as part of my pho restaurant rotation. I had the rare beef with vegetable pho, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Mymy is the place to go. It's a perfect place for a fast meal especially that the service is very quick. Food is always fresh and wonderful! Giving it top score because it's that great."}
{"text":"My favorite pho in mtl. Great bon bo huay with a good amount of meat,also the soup is just perfectly tasty. You could add an extra 3 dollars for the extra mixed meats that combines all the best beef parts with the regular porc ham. Prices are taxes included and it seems cleaner than other pho restaurants."}
{"text":"The Pho is ooo-kay, Pho Lien opposite of Jewish Hospital is still my preference. The drinks are overpriced with the given size. Servers all look like we owe them money, not sure why. They should smile when serving."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé soupe poulet grillé large et il y avait 4 petits morceaux de poulet, très décevant.  Pense pas je vais y revenir"}
{"text":"Came here to eat with my uncle and aunts on a Saturday morning. I got the all dressed pho. When it came out, the smell and taste was off putting. My aunt took a small sip of the broth and said that it's probably ok. So i started to eat it but I couldn't finish it. Not long after I started feeling weird. I'm really sorry to say this... I got food poisoning. My family didn't because they ordered other items on the menu. I would also like to add that while going towards the bathroom, I saw them pulling the beef bones (old) that was in a fabric bag out of a broth pot and put it back into another pot. Trust me when I say that it's not something they should be doing."}
