{"text":"Housed with the Great Canadian Pizza place, the Indian menu offers a variety of dishes for take away. They also do donairs and shawarma platters. Took away a korma, beef vindalo, butter chicken and basmati rice. The food was hot and fresh. I think the dishes were good, but was a little disappointed that the vindalo was not very hot (in terms of spiciness). However, the naan bread was awesome! Definitely the better choice to the pizza. Will have to go again for the donair!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken and palak here is delicious! I think they've just recently changed the way their butter chicken is made, as it has more of a strong tomato taste than how they used to make it. Also, their nan bread is huge! A tip would be to speak very clearly on the phone when ordering, we've had many mistakes with our order like saying \"2L Iced Tea\" then coming home to a \"2L Diet Coke\". But other than minor misunderstandings... Love this place when we don't feel like cooking dinner; it's affordable, fast, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great service great food. I've had the chicken biriyani on two occasions and it is exactly the right amount of spicy. I did ask for it to be hot and it was. I also had beef samosas and a lamb dish. I have ordered and done a pick up and the food has been ready in a timely manner. Also portions are generous."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The beef donair was fantastic. This place is just so great highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their butter chicken is awesome, as can be expected, their donairs are awesome and their pizza is pretty good as well. We order the butter chicken quite often and have their donairs every few months and stop in for the occasional slice of pizza on the way home when we're in need of a quick and easy snack."}
{"text":"It's fast food for pizza and Indian food. Kinda weird combo. I was hungry and in a rush so I stop in. They have a big selection of both pizza and Indian food to choose from. Place is new and looks clean. The service was quick but I was the only one there.   I decided to try the Indian food and got a chicken tikka masala with a side order of nana bread. It was really good. The portion size was good and the bread was made fresh. As a fast food restaurant it's comparable to a sit down Indian restaurant. Definitely will be coming back to try other Indian dishes and maybe the pizza. Best part I live close enough for free deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"Last Friday, my boyfriend took me to Butter Chicken Hut restaurant after work. We picked up some food to go from there. It was our 2nd time having food from there. It was a super small Indian restaurant, but it has some many selections on the menu and the food there was awesome.  Environment:  Butter Chicken Hut is an Indian restaurant, located on Copperpond Rd SE Calgary. The location of the restaurant is right beside of the Timmies and the gas station. The location is very easy to find and convenience for people parking their cars. It is a small restaurant. There are only two tables and several chairs inside the restaurant. People can either eat in or take to go. Mostly, people order take out. Inside the restaurant is very organized. The open kitchen is very clean.  Service:  We arrived restaurant around 4:45 pm. There were no many customers in the restaurant. We waited at the counter for few mins, the cashier took our order. He was very nice and friendly. Great customer service.  After that, the cook began making food in front of us.   Food:  We had two beef donairs and honey garlic chicken wings. The sauces of beef donairs were very great and tasty. The chicken wings were my favourite. All the wings were bread wings. The wings were crispy and juicy. The most important thing is everything fresh in this restaurant.  Price: The prices of our meal is a little bit expensive. I think it's because of the chicken wings.  In summary, we have a great experience in this small Indian restaurant. I really want to try their lamb curry next time (my boyfriends would like to try their Pizza because it looks awesome). Highly recommend people to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been ordering take out from the Butter Chicken Hut for a year or so now and have been very satisfied with their service and food. They do free delivery for the Copperfield and New Brighton area, which is a plus.  We usually order their butter chicken, rice, naan bread, lamb vindaloo, and at one time we ordered some samosas. We have also ordered their pizzas, but those weren't as great as their Indian food selection.  The speed of their service is good. We usually order 30 minutes in advance and when we come to pick up the food, it is always ready. Their delivery is quick as well.  Their food quality is good, like I said the pizzas aren't their strong point. Their butter chicken  and plain naan bread is our favorite. Their lamb vindaloo has just the right amount of heat and the lamb is very tender. Their samosas were a bit dry and wasn't really all that special, so probably not going to order those form them again, but will keep frequenting their restaurant for our favs.  I think the Butter Chicken Hut is a great neighborhood restaurant where you can satisfy your Indian food cravings."}
