{"text":"Good food, amazing prices. DÃ©cor is ok strongly recommend for takeout. The beef and broccoli was very good (portion and taste)"}
{"text":"We always get delivery from this place. Everything is top notcj. I like their shrimp dimplings with sesame oil and their coconut soup."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! I have ordered anything on their menu and everything is delicious ! My favourite thing from them is Hokein me noodles ! Good price and they give you a lot ! My husband and I share one dish and it fills us both. He is a BIG guy so he eats a lot. I definitely will Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for pad Thai. Food quality/taste was average. Quantity was decent but not so happy with the taste. It was pretty bland. Wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good and it is just sad that I have to rate it at 3 stars now. In three years that we live in this area, we ordered from Amazing Thai at least 20+ take outs and home deliveries. Yet, in the past 6 months the quality of food went down big time and it is now mediocre at best. We thought that the ownership changed to Chinese, so we tried to order some traditional Chinese dishes (e.g. Cantonese Chow-Mein) there, but these was bland and tasteless. My husband was so upset about his Malay Curry Lamb today (there was no meat, just bones) that he threw their takeout menu to garbage, so we obviously aren't going to order from them again..."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the pad Thai which was delicious. The crispy won tons were good too! Server was knowledgeable about menu and ingredients. Good service."}
{"text":"Amazing?  Average Thai might be a better name. We ordered pad Thai which was a little too dry and light on seasoning. Broccoli beef which tasted more of jarred garlic than anything else. Green curry was decent but not strong on flavor.   Not a bad meal but a little bland and undrwhelming. The delivery guy came quickly. Not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  I like to go for their lunch specials, since they are super affordable and the portions are good.  I like to order the Malay Chicken lunch.  It comes with coconut rice with a fried egg on top, and Chicken Malay Curry with vegetables.  The staff is super nice and friendly as well.  I have gone back several times."}
{"text":"Mediocre. It's more of a Chinese restaurant than Thai though. It's one of those restaurants that offer everything Asian so they're not specialized in anything in particular. Which means the flavours aren't all there. Price and portion size is good if that's all you're looking for."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. The food was average, the service was quick, and the place was a bit cluttered but very clean. Overall a nice place to eat, I'd come here again if I was passing by."}
{"text":"Chop Suey, Chicken Balls & a Fortune Cookie.   If that sentence meant anything to you then you know this is not the place for you!  Location: right off east side of yonge in a small plaza directly across the RH Performing Arts Building.   Small cozy booth style inside but they can accommodate a group by re arranging tables, which is nice.   Menu: Thai and random Chinese dishes from north to south China flavours. It's Canadian Asian style and flavour palette which makes it easy for some to experience this cuisine. But for experienced Asian cuisine lovers do not venture here, Madarin would be more authentic of an experience.   Red curry was very watery and not by the means of extra coconut milk!   Chop suey is a mix of meats(BBQ pork slivers, baby shrimp, chicken) with bean sprouts of traces of other vegetables, like a stir fry?  General Tao- not spicy at all but well cooked so the chicken is not dry, sauce is sweet, and broccoli is al dente.   Pad Thai- I requested the chef to Thai it up, this does work at some places, but not here. We got lime, crushed peanuts and noodles that tasted like tamarind and ketchup made out.   Saving grace dish: Malay curry with fish! Still a milder version of Malay curry,so it didn't offend anyone trying it, fish is lightly breaded and deep fried, in a warm spice of yellow coconut curry like dish.   Love supporting local, this place was a 5* to a friend who raved about the dishes, and how authentic it is. I must be snobby and won't order here again, I should have known when I saw chicken balls on the menu!"}
{"text":"1.5 star  Amazing Thai is not that amazing.  On a Saturday evening, I walked into an empty restaurant.. No one else but me.. eating alone.  Menu has a mixture of Cantonese and Thai. That's never too promising, not because Chinese cannot make good Thai food but just Amazing Thai is kind of what Chinese thinks Thai food should be...  Chiang Mai Fried Noodle ($9.95) which I ordered extra spicy has no spiciness at all... sad that fresh chili was not used to spice up the dish just like in Thailand. But this is a dry curry based fried yellow noodle.. never had that before, not even in Chiang Mai?! The use of basil to add taste though was a good touch.  General Tao Chicken, Black Bean Chicken, Chicken Chop Suey, Young Chow Fried Rice...are all in the menu..I don't feel good about this place...... Maybe this is suppose to be Fusion?   Lunch Specials $6.95 till 4 pm... Deco is really simple.. the walls reallly need some decorations to warm the place up and not feel as cold and bland.  I suggest a pass...  What an irony that Amazing Thai is in the same plaza as an Adult Video store and a sketchy Wings place where people drinks and plays pool more than eating chicken wings..."}
