{"text":"Yume is Japanese themed, with a nice selection of sushi rolls and bento boxed lunches, but the best food on the menu is Korean.  The restaurant is small, with a friendly and efficient staff.  Food is served promptly.  Quality control is excellent.    

But I know what you're saying, so what?  What's so special about that?  Scottsdale has plenty of good Japanese and/or Korean restaurants, right?

I've got three words for you:

Bi bim bap.  

This dish ranks #30 on the list of the world's most delicious foods and you've probably never heard of it.  

You'll probably giggle when you say the name, but for heaven's sake, no matter how fun it is to say bi bim bap over and over, don't do it.  Sure, it's not often you get food with a name that's alliterated, but sadly, most people don't see the beauty in this.  Trust me, I know. 

What, you ask, is bi bim bap?  In Korean, it means 'mixed rice', but to you and me?  The most excellent beef/rice/veg dish you will ever have.  Seriously.  On the bottom is some nicely seasoned ground beef.  Atop that, steamed white rice.  Then, a rainbow selection of vegetables, some raw, some pickled, some cooked.  Then, the crowning glory, a fried egg - sunny side up, and a garnish of roasted seaweed strips. How to eat it, you ask?  First, there's a red bottle on the table, snag it.  I know what you're thinking, anything could be in that bottle!  Easy tiger, It's chili sauce. Now spiral a bit of sauce over the top of the egg and veg.  Note at this point, that there's a spoon in your bowl, a tablespoon.  You can use in conjunction with your chopsticks or on its own.  Take that handy spoon and break up the egg, letting the yoke flow.  Now mix it!  All of it. Tuck in, mate. You can now die happy. 

In my opinion, the menu would be complete with just the one item, but the seafood pancake (dinner menu) is also delicious.  It's huge, and as the name implies, filled with seafood.  What seals the deal though, is the sauce.  A thick brown sesame seed, soy, sugar, green onion concoction (ancient Korean secret recipe, no doubt) which probably has enough salt in it to raise your blood pressure.   Just go for it. 

No worries, life's too short anyway!"}
{"text":"Great prices and great sushi! Spicy Tuna is some of the best I've had anywhere. Very clean, friendly staff, good a around. Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant dining experience here... being of Korean heritage, I will say not all of their Korean offerings are authentic, for example the bulgogi leans more towards a teriyaki flavor, which I'm sure is to appeal to a larger palate. The service was fantastic though, they were so attentive and cleared away plates and bowls immediately, food was fresh and served very quickly. The prices were reasonable.. so even though the food didn't blow me away, I would go back simply for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by for another Happy Hour Sushi Fix, service was great and the price was nice also. Delicious food keeps bringing me back."}
{"text":"I have always had trouble finding a great shrimp fried rice in the Valley.  Once I stopped into Yume, I knew I had a favorite!  Most places don't really fry the rice, but Yume does a great job--8 shrimp included for a lunch price of $9.95 which includes a miso soup and salad.

I had tried their sushi as well, and have always been impressed.  The owner is always there, rolling sushi and cooking.  He loves talking with his customers, and the service has always been wonderful!

It's a little hard to find in the mall, but they are worth it to me!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunchtime spots for three reasons: delicious sushi, fresh fish, and always quick and prompt friendly service. Their prices are also more reasonable than other sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"The service here is great. Everyone working is joyful and happy to accommodate. The food is fresh and paired nicely, and the presentation is well done. I will definitely recommend Yume to anyone looking for a good sushi joint."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. Some rolls a little on the pricey side however they freshness and taste is great. Friendly atmosphere, clean facility. They have something for everyone. Great food, great price. Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"The customer service, quality of the food, environment and price at Yume is fantastic.  Everytime that we come here there are always smiling people!  It shows that the owners of this place really take a lot of pride in everything that they offer!  

- Great Menu
- Great $$
- Friendly Staff
- Cool Environment
- Health Code \"A\" Rated"}
{"text":"okay, we've been back several times for lunch, and we are hooked. however, we are worried b/c there never seems to be enough people in the place to keep them up and running. they are directly across from Flo's, which we USED TO frequent all the time. but, Flo's has really gone down hill over the years and it's really a shame.

the people at Yume are gracious and always give service with a smile. they really do appreciate their customers.

the food is ALWAYS fresh, and that includes the rice. the sushi rocks, the Bi Bim Bab rocks, the Bulgogi rocks, the soup and salad rock, the yakimandu rocks, the kimchee rocks, the yakisoba rocks, the california rolls rock, the spicy crab rolls rock. heck, it ALL rocks!!! we plan on trying their seafood pancake next time, along with the jabche.

we just can't say enough good things about this place. PLEASE, go give it a try! we don't want them to close shop! we'd eat here EVERY DAY if we could!!! we promise, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just discovered this amazing place, we stopped by for happy and hour, what a great price and awesome selection. While we're waiting for our order we got complimentary edamame and (what a great treat on a rainy day!) cup of hot miso soup, also complimentary. I've ordered squid salad and I'm telling you its a best squid salad I've ever had, bits my favorite Sting Ray's octopus salad by far! Then we got our sushi, absolutely wonderful, tasted very fresh. I highly recommend every sushi lover to check this place out, this is not your typical busy, loud sushi restaurant, place is small, very quiet and laid back, you can actually enjoy your meal there."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant in the valley! My favorite is the Bulgogi dish! It is sooooo good! They offer six Korean side dishes such as Kimchi alongside your Korean entree (although their Kimchi is a bit too sour/strong for my taste). ALSO you get a complimentary Miso soup before your meal! The sushi is pretty good, too. I love their deep fried sushi rolls! Always hits the spot!!! The atmosphere is really nice and the staff is friendly. All these things add up and equals a great experience, again and again and let's go there again tonight! :D"}
{"text":"Good prices considering your in the middle of the desert! They even have happy hour from 2-6 everyday!! Including weekends! Pretty cool. Anyways, service was great and the sushi was super good, we are salmon lovers so we got salmon sashimi, salmon roll, spicy salmon roll and a Cali roll, everything was super good! The only reason I gave this place a 4* rating was because it was empty. Luckily I have gotten sushi from there so it didn't deter me. Worth a try for anyone craving sushi and wants to avoid overpriced and crowded 'RA Sushi'

Hope this helps your decision to go there!"}
{"text":"It was a little tough to find because google maps shows it in the wrong place, but I'm glad I found it. 
I went for dinner and was one of just a few people there. It was a very small but clean and nice restaurant. The owner, Jim, personally made a couple of my rolls and was very friendly and personable while I was there at the bar. He even offered to customize a couple of rolls for me. 
I ordered 2 rolls from the spicy menu and was pleased with them, they both came loaded with crab/scallops/lobster on top and were very filling and good. 
The service was fantastic, I usually go through several glasses of water at a restaurant and my glass always had plenty of water in it. 
The pricing was also very reasonable, I ordered 3 specialty rolls and paid $10 each for them. 
I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in Scottsdale. Always fresh fish and one of the few places carrying Korean dishes. And Korean food is spot on. They have a variety of menu even for non-raw fish eaters. Try their hamachikama; one of my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just returned from dinner here.  We sat at the bar.  We ordered two squid salads, 10 pc sashimi combo, dragon roll, phoenix roll, 2 fresh water eel nigiri, quail egg and 2 scallop hand roll.   We shared a bottle of the Pearl Nigori Genshu sake. 

Everything was top notch except the squid salads.  This is one of my favorite things and I nearly always order one to start my sushi dinner no matter where I go.  Their's seemed a bit dry as there was no kind of dressing although the quality of the ingredients were fine.

The Chef's Choice 10 pc sashimi combo included 3 salmon, 4 yellow tail and 3 white tuna.  My boyfriend tends not to like salmon as much as other fish but he thought the quality, flavor and tenderness where superb.  All three fish types were tender and flavorful.  There was a light sauce (oil and ??) on the white tuna.  The daikon was super fresh.

The dragon roll was fine but nothing special.  We enjoyed the phoenix roll with it's spicy tuna and salmon top. The quail egg was laid on some type of of flavored oil.  I couldn't place the flavors but it was rich and satisfying.  Fresh water eel is one of my favorites and these were more than fine. We finished off our meal with the scallops hand roll which were perfect.

We came here once before about three years ago with a Groupon and somehow never returned until today.  We'll add this one into our regular sushi rotation.  Prices are reasonable and quality is good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my chicken bento! Delicious! Next time I'll be back to try sushi! The also have great edamame!! I love finding local places when I'm in town and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi plater is to die for! The plating are really pretty, that you look like you were dining in a fine restaurant. Pricing is average, and worth every cent.

We dined in for dinner and the restaurant was busy. They only had one host/server that time and has very limited seating."}
{"text":"Never returning again!!! First of all when my family walked in everyone including the chefs were sitting around and talking while two tables were waiting. We sat down and wait 15 minutes before our we meet our waitress who was very friendly and kind to us. We ordered the appetizer of the fried shrimp. When it came there were flies in it (I will be posting the photo of it). I didn't eat it. Then my mom who drinks tea everyday ordered hot tea. It came out looking like green throw up. Finally as we finished our meal that was average the lady who was very kind came to check in when a group of party people came in to eat sushi. We got the check and left right after that. In conclusion I don't want to go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Went on yelp before coming here to see if it was a bust..not a bust! If you didn't know I am a sushi lover! Me and my brother came here before his Lasik eye appointment..and Oh. My. Goodness. Delicious! We were most impressed by the spicy yellow tail. And cannot believe how cheap it was during happy hour! Can't wait to be in the area again just to go here again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. I was at Yume about three hours ago, and currently find myself praying to the porcelain gods in my bathroom. Terrible fish that is clearly tainted."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Scottsdale! I've tried at least 5 other major Sushi restaurants in Scottsdale and Yume is by far my favorite. They have all the standard rolls and a few flavors all their own. They have an excellent happy hour menu and it's 7 days a week! You have to try the food here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Yume a number of times and really enjoyed the food and service every single time.  Whether i've ordered sashimi, rolls, soup or anything else, the results have been quality ingredients prepared correctly and served quickly.  This place is perfect for a quick lunch or a night out.  There are a lot of sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, Yume stands out as one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"YUME means DREAM & that it is!!!  We stumbled across this little gem some time ago & have been going back ever since. Jay the owner is a master at what he does. The plates of sushi are art pieces that look as good as they taste. His fish is very fresh with generous portions at a great price. I haven't had a bad meal ever. They also have a large menu for those who prefer other kinds of food besides sushi. We now bring all of our friends or clients & they've really enjoyed everything. Also, ask Jay for ANYTHING special & he's the guy to do it....YUME you are my dream...."}
{"text":"We love Yume Sushi and usually hit this place once a month.  Food is inexpensive but extrememly fresh...presentation is great and the service is always very good!  Tried a number of places in the valley but nothing comes close to Yume...we are happily hooked!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here at Yume!!! I love the sushi, the staff and how clean the restaurant is. I give this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very casual place but great food. I had the spicy crunchy roll (amazing), the centipede roll (very good) and an eel hand roll (good but didn't stand out as much). Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Meh. 
I shouldn't start by saying I was disappointed to not partake in a bit of sake with my dinner, but there you have it. Good news is they are applying for a liquor license. Bad news, I'm not sure I'll return. 

Overall, the feel of Yume is utilitarian. The booths are fine but the tables are cafeteria-like and the retro chairs don't look all that comfy. The noisy soda fountain in the middle of the restaurant is sort of annoying and continued to bring back memories of eating on campus in college. 

I will however say I have an appreciation for sushi joints that treat you with not just miso soup, but that iceberg salad with pretty yummy ginger dressing. I haven't seen the likes of that since my days living in DC. The miso was really, really good. 

We ordered the standards: spicy tuna, salmon sashimi, caterpillar roll, soft shell crab and one of their special rolls: the summer Vegas. It always seems if you can get the spicy tuna right, everything else will be good too. And I guess this was sort of the case. First plate arrived with the spicy tuna and sashimi. I liked it but Honey thought the salmon was off. Yikes. His test of good sushi is how their sashimi stands up on it's own and well, they sort of failed. 

The other rolls were good. They weren't the kind to resonate with me for days, but it was good sushi. I liked the summer Vegas with the outer edges deep fried and the perfectly balanced jalapeno on top, but the sauce was too thousand island dressing for me. 

Overall, if you are shopping in Promenade and have a hankering, by all means, fill your belly here. But be warned: you just might find yourself gazing fondly at Cantina Laredo across the way as I did."}
{"text":"Meh. 2 stars both for food and atmosphere. Not impressed-- sushi did not taste fresh and everything was just ok. Don't waste your money ('cause it's not cheap, either). Will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"Not sure where the hype for this place comes from..I'd suggest you see for yourself but you will probably be let down. There are some decent sushi places in north Scottsdale and this isn't one of them. The place smells of a cleaning solution, the food is poor quality. If you're looking for a new sushi place, keep looking."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious. So glad I found this place. Hard to find a real sushi and Japanese grill. Yummmm"}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent as are the prices. The service is also very accommodating. I only wish they were open longer on Saturday night and open at all on Sunday. A lot of the time I'm forced to settle for somewhere else because Yume is closed. Other than that it's my favorite sushi joint in the valley."}
{"text":"OK, maybe I caught it on a bad day.  Got the Katsu Bento.  Amazingly bad pot sticker.  Like something dehydrated for hours and then fried.  Midget spring roll was also overcooked and heavy.  Pork must have been fried frozen as the panko was dark brown instead of golden brown.  Rice was ok.  Also ordered Salmon and Tuna Nigiri.  Although disappointing in size, flavor and freshness was good.  Service was swift with my bento being replaced by a check in one move.  I might go back, but I would never bring someone here to impress them.   On seeing all the other positive review, I will give it another try, but like I said, not with company."}
{"text":"Fooled by yelp reviewers again! Being from the bay area, i expected a decent meal and was not satisfied. Food is average, portions are large, sushi is so so."}
{"text":"We love Yume!  My husband has been eating at Yume for about 4 years.  He goes a couple times a week for lunch.  He introduced it to me a few months ago and now we go almost every week as a family.  I don't like seaweed paper, which is why I thought I didn't like sushi, so I get soy paper.  Our 8 year old son loves the chicken bento box.  The service is great too!  We've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Highly recommend the jalapeño poppers with spicy tune! Beef short ribs are delicious. Best kept secret. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Rainbow roll in town! Sit at the bar and talk to the sushi chefs....great staff, fabulous service! Has become our favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"Always consistent food and great place to come. My fav tofu soups, spicy pork , and customized unaju bowl and lobster roll..."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service (always same two ladies).  Fast and fresh sushi. Prices are pretty decent.  I always leave happy."}
{"text":"Sashimi was not fresh. They could only serve alcohol inside. We sat at the outside patio so no sake for us. Overall was not good."}
{"text":"Great price for all the food! Quality is exceptional! The specialty rolls are an absolute must! The bento boxes are around $7 and really great for children!"}
{"text":"Still yummy!  First of all, I have to rave once again about the free miso soup and salad that comes before you even begin to order.  I am addicted to the salad dressing.  They should bottle it and sell it!!!

We were craving the Monkey Brains ever since our last meal here (an incredible melding of flavors and textures that melt in your mouth) and wanted to try at least one of the Korean dishes.  We ordered the Summer Crunch Roll (Fried Shrimp, Spicy Crab & Cucumber with Crunch outside), and it was fresh and quite tasty.  

The owner came by to see how we were doing (he remembered us from a couple of weeks ago, even remembered that we were with another couple trying oodles of appetizers) . . . That is impressive!  We talked a bit about the Korean options on the menu and he recommended the Beef Bulgogi (Grilled Prime Cut of Beef, marinated House Sweet Soy Sauce).  He promised we wouldn't be disappointed . . . and we weren't.  Out come a long, large rectangular plate with mounds of the most moist, flavorful and tender beef, with a heaping  portion of white rice, and two delicious Mondu (potstickers).  We were in a lovely food coma after having polished off the entire plate!  Next time, Pork Katsu!

Early on a Friday evening, they had a steady stream of customers which is very promising for a restaurant just starting. And it looks like as the warmer weather draws near, they will have some patio seating as well. Yippee!!"}
{"text":"Really nice little place with some really nice sushi and really nice people. The prices were really nice too!!! Unfortunately the constant smell of backed up sewage isn't really nice. Fix that and it could stay in my back pocket for emergency sushi when the craving strikes."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's locally owned and I think it's a family.  They are from Korea, and the menu reflects some Korean specialities as well as terrific, freshly prepared, and beautifully presented sushi.  They have a good happy hour and reasonable non-HH prices.  Please patronize!"}
{"text":"delicious food. the shrimp udon is to die for! also free miso soup and salad. great customer service and delicious sushi. this is my new favorite sushi place! :)"}
{"text":"Super good! Always fresh and tasty. I eat the spicy chicken and my husband loves their bulgogi. If you enjoy sushi, this is the best I have had in the area. I can't count the number of times I have eaten here, too many."}
{"text":"Decent lunch spot.  I stopped in last week - the service was fast and the prices were reasonable.

Based on some of the reviews, I wish I'd ordered off the sushi menu.  I opted for a bento lunch box with terriyaki salmon instead.  It was pretty tasty, though not filling if you have a ravenous appetite.  The menu had lots of options and I'd happily stop in again to try something else."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch.  There was a pretty good set of options for some Korean food and some sushi.  It did not seem to be a typical Korean restaurant.  We had two of the sushi platters.  The food was quick to arrive and the fish was fresh and fine.

It worked out great for a lunch that took less than an hour to order and eat."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but the food has no flavor. We ordered salmon and tuna. Salmon was fishy and the tuna was very off. Come here if you want to feel disappointed and ripped off when walking out."}
{"text":"Food 
The food was delicious and portions were large.  Prices were very reasonable so from a value perspective Yume is very good.  

Service
Our server tried her best so I give her A for effort but she was confused at times and not very efficient.  Also, she failed to mention that she charged 18% gratuity on our bill.  This resulted in one person over tipping which was corrected eventually but should not have happened.  

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly attentive service.  Around 5:30 when we usually go, families with kids are common, which lets us fit in nicely!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, may daughter loved the yaki udon  full of noodles and fresh vegetables and fried rice and I love the Sushi rolls. Service is great."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service!

My husband is a sushi guy and this is generally his go to!! He highly recommends the Sun Devil Roll!

I'm not a sushi gal so it's generally hard to agree on a place that has decent non-sushi food. So glad we found Yume! I love their beef fried rice! Full of veggies and steak pieces."}
{"text":"WOW!!! From a Sushi Expert I love this Sushi Bar

I'm a self proclaimed Sushi expert having eaten in thousands of Sushi Bars all over the country including the entire west coast from San Clemente to Seattle. Up to now I have only given 10 five stars, all but one on the west coast. 

Yume Sushi Bar is defiantly another 5 star! Everything is as good as it gets from the rice to the fresh fish and presentation."}
{"text":"First time ever been in, sort of fell upon it and loved it. The service was friendly and the sushi was great. We had desert roll, Alaska deluxe roll and the spicy Cali. We loved all three, prices are very responsible for the quality of food. Sushi is as good as you'd find in some of the trendy spots around Scottsdale, it may not have the fancy decor but the sushi is on par with the very best in town. We will definitely come back.

{"text":"Love love love this place! Great sushi! And great service! Food is of excellent quality. Alien brain is a must to order! Baked scallop is also a great favorite. It's a casual place so no need to dress up. Very simple, but it's for sure a favorite."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good! Fresh, friendly, reasonably priced. We sat outside which was not much to look at because you are kind of staring out at a parking lot, but it was quiet so that was a plus. Food was great - tried the spider roll, and some spicy rolls... Yellowtail sashimi.... We had a big variety and were not disappointed. Definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Fantastic prices for some really good Sushi.  Seriously good environment as well.. this is added to the once a week list for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the mixed reviews of this place!  We stopped in tonight and had a great experience.  We started out with a couple orders of hamachi sushi that were some of the freshest that we've had in quite awhile.  The sushi chef was a very entertaining and funny man, he even pointed out, much to my husband's dismay, that the Kirin Ichiban beer that he was drinking (and loves) is actually made in the U.S. by Anheuser-Busch...needless to say, he will never order that beer again!  We than moved  on to the spicy tuna roll, which is made just with Sriracha and doesn't have any mayonnaise to mask the flavor of the fish.  We had a few more orders of hamachi and then ordered the \"Snow White\" roll, (a daily special) which was the spicy tuna roll with white tuna on top and garnished with a dab of Sriracha on top. It was excellent!  We then asked the sushi chef for his recommendation and he made us an order of albacore tuna sushi with a miso mustard sauce on it.  What an incredible presentation!  We immediately ordered another order.  Overall, the cuts of sushi were very meaty and everything was incredibly fresh. 

The atmosphere was slightly lacking, but the sushi chef (owner) told us that he was in the process of ramping up and had already ordered a large fish tank to go on one wall and was planning to re-do the paper lanterns with hanging lights.  He also told us that he's been in the U.S. for 18 years now and finally has his own restaurant after starting out as a dish washer (kudos to him!) and that he can't believe how his competitors will serve day old fish.  

I think we've found our new North Scottsdale go-to sushi place!"}
{"text":"Had awesome lunch here. Great super fresh tasty sushi and our waitress even knew what beer would go with our rolls."}
{"text":"Hidden gem we love this place! Great food and good prices too. Went in for happy hour but there was no happy hour which was fine with the already low prices and tasty food we left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. There is a variety of dishes to choose from their menu. Great lunch specials and sushi!"}
{"text":"Never fails I have been coming this place over years and I can say they really know what they are doing to make great food. I have not yet had anything that I didn't like. Sushi to soft tofu soup Korea soup and many more. Everyone that works here seems very happy with what they do."}
{"text":"Yume has amazing fried rice, edamame, and chicken katsu! I don't eat sushi so I cannot review that, but I always attend with my sushi loving friends and they swear the sushi is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Groupon brought me to Yume Sushi, but yummy sushi, friendly service and great prices will bring me back!  I'm looking forward to trying some of their Korean dishes next time."}
{"text":"I have been here two times with my family, and enjoyed both meals.  Excellent Sushi, and had a bento box, then fried rice another time.  The appetizers I had were just okay, but the main courses were excellent.  There was only one server (who remembered us from our first visit 4 weeks prior), so the service was slow but friendly."}
{"text":"We love sushi and are always looking for a place that's not outrageous in price, but has quality sushi. We just ate here for our anniversary and it was great! We didn't have a wait, the food came out very quickly, the staff was really nice, the music was current and upbeat (we were singing in our seats), fun easy going decor, and the sushi ROCKED!  So fresh and delicious!  New favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Fish, prices and atmosphere was mediocre at best.  No alcohol at sushi joint is bizarre."}
{"text":"Have been coming here weekly for a number of months. It is always a great experience! The sushi is fabulously fresh every time we coke for dinner. And tonight was an extra special treat from our fave sushi chef - Duke!!! It was live scallop night. He prepared it four ways - nigiri, sashimi, tempura and baked. I had to preorder the live scallop a week ahead...but SO worth it. And Duke made each preparation a work of art. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place! The whole staff is awesome! The fish is fresh, sushi is hands down the best in town! All the staff is friendly. The owner is great too, if he's not behind the counter preparing sushi himself then he's always checking in on the guests. This is great family owned business, a diamond in the rough! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yume Sushi Grill is an extravagant example of perfected asian cuisine. The quality of food and service is terrific and I would gladly return to Yume Sushi Grill

{"text":"I love this place so much the food and people are amazing. I just moved here from Salt Lake City and didn't think I would find a new sushi home... I love you guys."}
{"text":"Yume is a very decent place. In my experience, it never gets crazy crowded and everyone was very chill. The bentos are great deals, you get a decent amount of food for the price and although it's not the best sushi in town or anything, it's still pretty dang good. 

The decor might be a bit older but, well, I came here for food, not to chill. We eat and leave, never hang around. So, it deserves a good rating"}
{"text":"Yume is a regular dinner spot for me. The food is out of this world, the value is amazing, and the service is top notch. You will never leave hungry! I haven't tried much other than the sushi, but all the sushi I have tried is delicious. My favorites are the Cajun Lobster and Sunset rolls! And don't forget the Alien Brain for an appetizer! I believe this is a family owned business and the staff treat you like a part of the family!"}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch since it's right around the corner.  I was excited, because I've never been here before and it looked pretty promising from the reviews. It did not disappoint!  I had the shrimp tempura as a starter and for my main dish I ordered the veggie fried rice with chicken.  It was great. Very flavorful and the chicken was white meat, so no mystery meat :) added a tiny bit of soy sauce and it was bomb. It's surrounded by a bunch of shops and other restaurants, and also has outdoor seating.  I'm so happy this place is in my hood!"}
{"text":"My favorite local spot for sushi! It easily beats the prices and quality of other sushi bars in this area.

GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY! Woohoo!

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they did indeed have gluten free soy sauce amongst other GF choices. 

The staff is friendly,prompt,accommodating and there's always a positive atmosphere.

If you like spicy, make sure to try the Spicy California roll! It's a perfect spin on the classic roll.
I still can't figure out how they keep their fish so fresh. It's the only sushi restaurant that I trust for sushi in the desert."}
{"text":"I was very surprised that all of us enjoyed our order. Who knew that North Scottsdale offers us foodies great selections of places to eat!! Woot-woot!! Fantastic!!

Yume is cool because they offer both Japanese and Korean Food. My Bibimbap was just fantastic and done just right. My Seared Tuna was surprisingly, really good and tasted very fresh. My coworkers also enjoyed all their orders and while I never had lollipop sushi ever, it was quite refreshing especially for a weather of 105 degrees!!  If you do decide to dine outside, they do have misters to cool you down which I thought was awesome. Overall great sushi house and Korean food in the area and probably one of the best including service!!

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times after an afternoon shop at the Promenade and have enjoyed the happy hour that is from 3-7. The service is very good. 
I had the mackerel dinner and it was great! 
The miso soup is delicious and the dressing on the side salad is very good. 
I think if the sushi were prepared with more veggies, like carrot or cucumber slices incorporated in some of the choices, then it would bring the quality up a notch and I'd frequent much more often. 
The quality and quantity is very good for the money. The decor is nice for a strip mall restaurant and can be interesting to look at. 
Yume means dream in Japanese."}
{"text":"I'm here from Boston golfing. Had an urge for sushi. My wife and I checked our IPad for local places and picked Yume based on a few reviews. We had doubts about sushi here in Scottsdale after all we live on the water back home. No concern for doubt @ Yume. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The fish was wonderful the value just as good. The atmosphere was quietly eclectic ...very relaxing and refreshingly non FooFoo for those of you want to enjoy a great meal without the pretense of a \"SCENE\". We had the Love Boat because we were both hungry it was a good choice for us. Rock solid place for sushi."}
{"text":"One of, if not the best sushi restaurants in north Scottsdale.  Great value, casual atmosphere, excellent service.  Most of all for me, clean!  Highly recommend for casual sushi experience."}
{"text":"Solid Asian restaurant and has some good Korean options which are hard to find around here! I've been twice (once for take out and once to dine in) Service was decent, nothing stellar, but we did come semi close to closing time. All of the food I've had has been good and they have some unique sushi rolls. I mean, you know it's gonna be good Asian food if over 50% of the patrons are Asian both time you go. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best sushi restaurants around! We've always had amazing food here and the service is exceptional! We love the variety and the high quality! Favorite go to choices: Jalapeño Poppers, Cajun Lobster Roll, and Seared Albacore Nigiri. I definitely recommend checking them out! ...unless it's a Sunday or Monday because they are closed."}
{"text":"Great customer service, fresh sushi. The check was a little pricey but overall was worth it. Also they brought full cups of to-go soda after our meal which has never been offered to me before anywhere!"}
{"text":"2 stars because if the service. Waitress, She/he had short hair, bob style. Rude, rude huge attitude. Terrible beyond belief. Will not go back because of her. Owner and rest of staff very nice and fish is pretty good. If in a pinch and can't get in anywhere else, last resort kind of place!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good- they were very friendly and fast.  Sushi was pretty good.  Loved the Lollipop roll.  Sun Devil roll was delicious.  I would go back again.  The atmosphere is nothing special, or else it would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yume Sushi is the best! We have tried many places, before and after we tried Yume, yet no one compares. They are quick. They are nice. They are fresh. And they are affordable. We can get 3-4 rolls, 2 beers and a soda for $25. We probably went there once every 7-10 days when we lived in Scottsdale. Highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"This cute Sushi restaurant is tucked away in the Promenade I've actually never seen it before. But I'm so glad I spotted it. I ordered the cucumber wrapped rolli pop to go.   They very nicely took off the salmon for me. :) I loved it and can't wait to try other things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of their Groupon deal I saw and I'm only giving them three stars because their promotion on Groupon is confusing! 50$ value towards food is probably the worst cheating system they came up with. 

We first walked in and the acknowledgement we got was rushing and unwelcome. I'm sorry that people eat lunch at 2pm?? They seemed a little unhappy. Our server was literally sitting at the table across from us and she didn't come over to get our drink order after 5-10 minutes. I understand if you have other tables but seriously there was like maybe one other table and they seemed like they were checking out so what's the deal here? 

She finally took her sweet time to come over, took our order and said she will let us know when we reached the 50$ mark for the Groupon deal. We got all the foods and she forgets to enter one dish, it totally went over the 50$ mark when she told me before that it was already at the 50$ mark... then charged 18% for gratuity for two person! That's ridiculous!!! Service wasn't even enough to be charging gratuity. If you're gonna be charing tips then at least be good at your job."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Seriously we could have eaten here three days in a row. 
It is a hidden gem.
The service was awesome and the owner was a nice guy and came out to talk to us. We had a great time just hanging out here. 

We mostly just had sushi and it was all great. 

Outstanding place. A real find and so reasonable! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Best testing sushi I've had in the Valley. I appreciate the truly Japanese feel of the place. The staff / family are truly friendly and caring. I can't wait to go back and imbibe in the myriad choices!"}
{"text":"We have been to Yume a number of times and walked away satisfied.  This time not so much.  The service was very poor.  Seemed like there was a single server working the entire restaurant which was full when we arrived.  We order a few nigiri sushi, and bento box and some Korean dishes.

Yume did not have kimchi fried rice which I found odd for a Korean restaurant.  My wife ordered bimbibap and it was not as good as normal.   

Not sure if we caught Yume on an off night or if there are more significant issues."}
{"text":"By far this is the best Sushi in Arizona if not in the Continental United States.  I have traveled all over the world and Jay (the owner) has figured it out.   Korean born and a master of Sushi.   He takes such pride in selecting his Sushi from markets. If you love great Sushi you will love Yume.  Little atmosphere, but who needs that when you're eating like a king."}
{"text":"Stumbled across Yume when I had some time to kill in the area and was craving sushi. It turned out to be a solid spot, and one worth going out of my way for in the future. 

The prices for the quality can't be beat and the hostess was incredibly friendly. Not much of a crowd when I went. I guess Scottdalers only like club music with their sushi. People need to venture out and try these smaller establishments. I like Sushi Brokers down the street just fine, but I got way more bang for my buck here. 

You know, I've had sushi all over the world and I'm often bewildered when people claim something isn't the best quality. I wonder what they compare it to. Most mid-price places taste the exact same to me, quality wise. It's the preparation that varies. This place pleased on both accounts."}
{"text":"Yume stands for dream and the sushi here is a dream. Great price for 10 pieces. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Food was great, service left a lot of room for improvement. Sat at the sushi bar where we could enjoy watching the chef prepare the food.  The problem is the view was obstructed with serving dishes on customer side and prep supplies on the chef side, couldn't see anything which goes against the principles of sitting there. Though it was early and very few customers, service was slow and wait staff seemed confused. One waiter had ear buds on for crying out loud! Lots of better places in Scottsdale, so management better step it up a bit if they want to survive. They might want to consider Apache Junction or geriatric ward."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Growing up in Louisiana, good sushi was not hard to find. Moving to AZ we were always trying to find a decent sushi restaurant. We've tried many places only to leave not satisfied, until we found Yume. Yume does not disaappint. One of the better sushi places in the area. Definitely a place you should visit."}
{"text":"I found this little restaurant through a voucher on dealchicken.com. I've lived minutes away from this place for 4 years and never knew about it. The food was just fabulous! We went for an early dinner and the place was very quiet when we arrived (which was fine with us) and the service was really top notch. Forget about all those overly trendy Scottsdale sushi places, this place is the real thing!"}
{"text":"I'm Korean and live in N. Scottsdale. Sick of driving to Mesa/Chandler for Korean food. Stopped by for n early dinner and we ordered off the Korean menu. 

Seafood pancake was good and so was the galbi.  The staff was Korean and gave me a side of kimchee!! :)

It will mosdef satisfy my cravings :)"}
{"text":"I heart beef bulgogi bento boxes! :)"}
{"text":"I work in the same shopping center and absolutely love going there for lunch! The atmosphere is nice, everyone has a smile, and I like the prices :) there's nothing there that I wouldn't have again! Cute place for a date or just some drinks. This is a must try! I recommend their rolls and bento boxes."}
{"text":"This place is all my sister raves about and now I see why. It is so delicious. Everything was beyond tasty. I ordered so much food I don't even remember what  I ordered. It was so good I couldn't stop eating that even the waitress was shocked at how much me and my skinny fiancé ate. She was like \"wow\". However, I did take pictures. The service was phenomenal. Our server was attentive and made sure everything we ordered was there and it was all cooked quick and to perfection. I cannot wait to come back. Also there is a Groupon we bought for $28 which allows you to get $50 worth of food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband on a Friday night... The restaurant was half full but seem to have a good buzz and energy. We sat at the sushi bar, we were the only two one sitting there. We had special request for sushi because of a certain diet that we are on and our sushi chef questioned everything that we asked them to do which were very basic requests. He also said that would taste weird. I know there's a special art when it comes to sushi but customers come first and if you're able to do it, do it. The one thing that we do not appreciate is that he didn't move from the station and yelled over everyone to talk to us about the rolls that we were wanting. 

Honestly, I am a salmon lover and the salmon I got, did not seem to be fresh at all, it tasted very fishy. I know there are plenty of really good sushi restaurants out there and the likelihood of me coming back here is very low."}
{"text":"I knocked a star off because the ambiance and parking aren't great. The ambiance is pretty 80s style and kind of cheesy.  If it's nice out, definitely opt to sit outside---you'll feel like you're on someone's patio, not in the middle of Scottsdale promenade. Prices are the most reasonable I've found in Scottsdale. Service is great.  They have a good selection of sake, pinnacle vodkas and fountain soda (weeeeeee!!!!). 

The manager (Jay?) is a doll--he was so helpful in picking out the perfect amount of food for an event I was hosting at work. The fish was all supremely fresh and tasty, and it was packaged and displayed beautifully and with the utmost care. 

Finally, I need to sing the praises of the spicy tuna roll at Yume. It's the best I've ever had - not only in Phoenix, but ever (this is saying a lot as I've lived in NY and eaten a lot of spicy tuna in my day).  It is made with no mayo---just pure heat.  Try it!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place! Simple menu, Extremely fresh fish and amazing prices. The TNT roll is fantastic and order the spicy tuna roll extra spicy if you like an extra kick. Great service too!"}
{"text":"No ice.

Out of menu items.

Dirty looks abound.

I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The service here is good but I feel the prices are a bit stiff I usually go for lunch if I have a hankering for Japanese food because I work close and I have ordered the bento box each time because it is priced in a reasonable range unfortunately there is not much to it and the main dish in this case chicken has been over cooked and even in the sauce is dry this lunch with tip was around 12 dollars"}
{"text":"Freshest sushi ever!  Great service!  Nice people!  Always head there for our sushi fix!!"}
{"text":"Wow - came out for a quiet sushi night - met head chef Duke and he knocked it out of the park with is creations.....nailed it.  Fresh, light, savory - don't miss this unassuming treasure!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! My husband & I stopped by tonight and everything was perfect.  Complimentary salad & Miso Soup while we looked over the menu. 
We went for the happy hour and they had a great selection & great prices.  Good size rolls too, we ordered only 3 rolls and were both full!
We were the only people in the whole place so they definitely need more advertising or something because it was delicious!  Hands down the best sushi my husband and I have ever had..and we like to try EVERY sushi place!
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yume is a nice little place for sushi and a few korean dishes.  Plenty of seating with a diner-like atmostphere.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Based on 1 dish alone I would start at a 3-star rating with definite potential to go higher to a 4.  I oNly had the chance to try the bi bim bop (rice bowl filled with veggies and a fried egg) this visit and thought they could do a few things to improve including:  using bulgogi meat instead of the ground beef, offering it 'dolsot-style' (aka in a hot clay pot) so that the bottom rice gets toasted, adding more variety of vegetables, and leaving the gojuchang ) hot pepper sauce on the side to add.  Also, the menu had a variety  of good things including the lunch bento box and sushi happy hour."}
{"text":"They're doing good things here.  The owner knows his fish, and the spicy ahi roll was on point.  They make a killer tonkatsu and  the hot sake was potent as well.  Come here and leave your AZ desert sushi misconceptions at the door.  They serve good food, and it's a welcomed change from a sub sandwich or tgi mcfudsters."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and oh my deliciousness! I ordered the TNT roll which had spicy tuna and crab, topped with scallops and a spicy mayo sauce for only $10 and some change!  Im still salivating from that roll. I also got a dragon roll that had really fresh avocado and then the crunch roll that contained crab, both scrumptious. The prices are really decent and you do get complimentary miso soup and/or salad which is a nice surprise. The staff was very friendly and fast. The restaurant itself is very clean and has a giant fish tank along one of the walls. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Coming from New York I was desperate for a sushi place that had GOOD FRESH FISH... in Arizona all sushi seems to be covered in Mayo.  The fish here is always SO fresh, plus they have White Tuna, which is my favorite.   My daughter has celiac and Jay is super helpful when we ask for gluten free dishes.   Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Really delicious food. Fresh.  Great customer service. Came out quickly. And parking is not a problem. Portion sizes are perfects and so are the prices!"}
{"text":"Great sushi here at this place. They will also make any kind of roll that you want, which leads to endless possibilities. It is not a very big restaurant, but it is actually just the right size. Good service and great food=must return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loved this place, and I thought it was okay. There were a few veggie options, but I only tried the avocado roll. It didn't taste as fresh as I would've liked. The rice was tasty and the service was pretty decent. I wish more places around here had creative veggie rolls. I haven't found it yet."}
{"text":"I am usually not the type of person who writes reviews but I felt compelled. 

I started going here in 2014 and pretty much fell in love. 

If your intention is to find the freshest fish in Scottsdale/Phoenix area then this is the place. Going anywhere different is just accepting an inferior product compared to what Yume has to offer. The prices are more than reasonable and the service in my opinion is unbeatable. This may come off as an exaggeration but it really is the best that you can get. Jay the owner really cares and knows how to wow his customers. I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a good place for Sushi and has pretty decent rolls available.  I come here semi-regularly for lunch.  The servers are always really nice and food is good.  One time I  asked the server about specific ingredients in something on the menu and she didn't know.  I came back randomly about three weeks later and she remembered me asking about the ingredients.  She had since done some homework. She brought up the subject with me again and answered all my questions I had three weeks prior!  It was amazing."}
{"text":"The people at this place were fantastic. We took our 3 kids 4,6,&8 yrs old. The staff helped with everything kids may ask for. The food was very good. I have to say I like Ra which is about 20 min. from this local better but for the price the food was good and the ambiance of this place I liked more than Ra. The outside patio on a warm summers night was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome service the Decour inside is really nice and they play top 40 music which made it kind of hip. It's OK if you don't eat sushi they have plenty of entrees on the menu for non-sushi eaters. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"YUME!  Oh what fun.  One of my favorite sushi stops.   The Alien Brain is a must have!  Rolls are really big, so only order 1 or 2 at a time.  Spider roll on this trip was very crispy and delicious. Everything we ordered was perfect.  

Great for lunch if you are shopping at the Promenade, dinner for the fun of it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this restaurant...friendly service.  The sushi was very good and the presentation was also just as good.  Loved everything about this sushi place....enjoyed the squid salad, Arizona, Phoenix and Over the Rainbow rolls.  This place will be our new favorite sushi place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I travel 150 nights per year and have eaten sushi in 42 states in the last year.  I rank Yume in the top 2 sushi restaurants in America.  The service is friendly, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous.  The fish is very fresh and the presentation is creative and very appetizing.  I am fortunate to live only about 6 miles from Yume."}
{"text":"Was shopping nearby and craved some sushi- read a bunch of great reviews so decided to stop by and try it. Walked into a cool atmosphere with only 1 customer inside (a Monday at 7pm). Was slightly hesitant based on the empty parking lot... However, the sushi was amazing! We got the Mardi Gras roll and a Cajun Lobster roll- both absolutely amazing! Great food, fast service.... And one happy full belly walking out of here!"}
{"text":"Since my original November review, we have been to Yume at least half a dozen times.  I have to upgrade my rating to 4 stars.  We love this place.  Food is always fresh and good.  The lady who always waits on us (she must work 24/7!) is one of the sweetest people I have met in AZ---she is just so nice and always seems happy and always so anxious to make sure we feel like valued guests.  And we do---and now we have been in often enough that we are totally treated like regulars.  The sushi and sashimi are to die for---always fresh and beautifully prepared and DH and DSGF  ordered the bento box meals and just rave.  I am probably being a brat for not giving them 5 stars---it's because I have to drive 30 minutes to eat at Yume.  If they'd move closer to Cave Creek, I'd rate them a SIX star!  Yume-yume-yume in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Yume is our current go to Sushi place.  We will some times meet there for lunch or an early happy hour (which is all day long).  We will even take the kids in on a weekend for an early dinner.  We have a favorite waitress--May.  She is wonderful and recognizes us every time we come in.  Now, if you are looking for a high end sushi experience, then you can pay for it.  But this is good quality food, without the fancy atmosphere.  

Each member has their favorite item on the lengthy menu.  The shrimp and vegetable tempura are wonderful.  The calamari is not prepared in rings like you usually see.  It is in half inch strips and covered with a light panko coating.  The rolls are great.  The golden crabby and the golden crunch are really good.  Even the stand by of the spicy tuna is fresh and tasty.  We especially love the salmon and tuna sashimi.  The chef even made me a cucumber salad with octopus in it.  Yum!

We have a really expensive sushi restaurant that we reserve for special occasions. It also costs us over $100 for 2 people.   However, for everyday, Yume is good quality seafood at a good price."}
{"text":"Staff is GREAT and helpful.  Food is fast and fresh and the price is very reasonable.  This is our new Sunday Afternoon Haunt."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I like this place. Great sashimi and a lot of menu options so you can get just what you like. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. Everything was just great, and this is the kind of place where I want to go back and try something new just to keep exploring the menu. I've been twice and when I sat at the bar the sushi chef was very nice and concerned that I enjoyed everything I got. And I did. Very clean and a casual atmosphere, which I like. Nothing to be concerned with except getting down with some good sushi and sashimi. As Arnold S. said, \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of coworkers for lunch today after reading some good reviews on yelp. Some of us tried soft tofu stew.  Since the owner is Korean, we thought some Korean dish might be good.  Let me tell you it was really good. So spicy, we had to ask for extra napkins to wipe for our face (and nose...lol).. I kept finding lots of seafood inside the stew, I couldn't believe it was only around $11 for this stew dish!
Like any other Korean dish, it comes with lots of appetizers. My favorite was kimuchi. The way they prepared was very light, just the way I like it.
We ordered sushi too. I had yellow tail hand-rolls. The sushi rice was prepared just right.  I would come back to try more sushi next time."}
{"text":"Its good, not great. Not bad either and I've definitely had bad here in the area of Scottsdale/Phoenix over a small period of time. We'll just leave it at that. I really have no qualms with the place, decent price, tasty but ok sushi. 

Perhaps if I tried other things on the menu than sushi I might have a better opinion. Or I'm just spoiled by Cali. Who knows."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed. Decent lunch hour prices as well as happy hour. Make sure that when you say you want something spicy to emphasize that you really want it spicy. There version of extra spicy was pretty weak."}
{"text":"Decided to bring my co-worker for lunch and we were seated, coming in from the heat in Arizona, the consideration of a cool place takes priority. Immediately we noticed it was very muggy, and humid. We ordered a teriyaki bento box and after about 40 minutes later on our lunch break, no food, and still trying to cool off, decided we would take it to go to instead. The chicken was terribly dry and tasted like they reuse the oil they cook fish with.. the California rolls tasted like miracle whip. The only impression i was left with Was a completely aweful aftertaste."}
{"text":"Last nights sushi was delicious. We ordered almost every sushi on the menu! Best: summer California, sea dragon, shrimp tempura, Louisiana, Las Vegas. We also ordered shrimp tempura Udon which was good and full of toppings compared to other sushi restaurants. We also got chicken teriyaki dinner meal which was a large portion and very good. We will go again for sure."}
{"text":"This is a carry out review.  I have not eaten inside the restaurant but the quality and prep of the sushi gets five stars.  It's the best sushi for freshness and taste in the neighborhood.  Its packaged well for transport also.  Portion size is perfect!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place here in Scottsdale. Great food and best of all great customer service! Definitely a great place to go if you're here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Yume!! I have recommended this place to many people and everyone has said they love it, including me!

A friend introduced me to this place about a year ago. The restaurant itself is tiny but the food is awesome!! You can custom create your own rolls (which I have yet to find at other sushi places) and every roll I've had on the menu is amazing! I love the atmosphere of sitting up at the bar (the guys behind the counter are hysterical and great to talk to) while you wait for sushi. 

I would recommend going during happy hour for the cheaper prices. I've also had some of their main dishes aside from sushi and those are delicious too. 

Yume is my favorite \"hole in the wall\" sushi place and I will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here almost once a week now, it's so Yummy! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I always get the Vegas roll and it is the best one I've ever had! They have this grey sauce on the side that is good it's addicting. For the quality of the sushi the price is insane! I say that because it is inexpensive. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Best sushi around!  I have visited a ton of sushi joints and until I stumbled upon this place I didn't know what a real sushi place was.  The chefs are very personable and I felt right at home.  Many times, I visit them for happy hour by myself however, I feel like family and the chefs actually remember me when I return and I keep coming back...   

The chefs are extremely creative and will make rolls on the fly.  I simply have to tell them what I am craving and they create something amazing based on what I want.  I have not experienced many sushi places that will customize everything.  I do not even ask for a menu anymore as they allow me to create my \"own\" menu.  

This is a family owned place.  No chains which I try avoid.  The family cares about the quality, service, and actually gets excited about their restaurant.  They want to please the customer and are always educating me on where they get their fish, what was just flown in and what they think I should try.  (Yep they remember what I had and like in the past.  That's what I call customer service!

The fish is incredibly fresh.  I was not a big sashimi fan until I started eating at Yume.  They have White Tuna that you cannot find at every sushi joint, as it is my understanding that the shelf life is only 12 hours.  They have a seared Albacore that is accompanied by a very light mustard sauce that is a perfect pair.  One of my favorite roll is the TNT, which has these warm huge bay scallops on top without the globs of mayo so many places use to bake their sushi toppings.  The other is the Naughty Girl that was created for me, as I wanted a \"fried element\" in my roll.  They took chopped fresh Ahi Tuna that was finely chopped, rolled them into balls, lightly batter and fried them, cut them in half and toped them on a roll with jalapenos, asparagus, avocado and cucumber.  You don't like jalapenos I am sure they will customize it just for you.  They also have sushi for the non-fish lovers that include a killer grilled ribeye roll.  Now I can get my boyfriend to visit there, as he is not a big fan of what he calls \"bait\".  

The prices are amazing.  They have a variety of sushi during lunch and happy hour that are 5 dollars and they actually consist of raw fish not just a cucumber.  

The ambience is just my style.  I am not looking for a meat market place that happens to serve sushi.  I want a place that I feel comfortable at with friends or by myself.  I am comfortable in my skin at Yume.  It is a great place for families also.  

Finally yet importantly, they have a VIP club for customers (like me) who frequent Yume often.  I got an incredible loyalty coin that is beautifully designed that allows me to get happy hour prices all day long.   What restaurant gives you happy hour prices all day?  

Bottom line is you have to try the place.  Its food, service and passion brings me back every time."}
{"text":"Decent Korean food for lunch.   We ordered a grilled hamachi kama for an appitizer.  It tasted good.   My husband's lunch box included bulgogi, California rolls, salad, rice, and a couple of pot stickers.  I had spicy pork which had good flavor.  Korean side dishes were okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"Sushi is my favorite food, with that being said I've had about every sushi place you can think of in the Scottsdale area. This is so far my favorite I've had! Their sashimi is SO FRESH I feel like they have an ocean right outside the locale. The way their sushi is categorized is also very helpful they have a section for the spicy rolls and the non spicy rolls along with chef specials that you can choose whether you want spicy or non!

Prices- AMAZING. Seeing that everything was so cheap, I was a bit skeptical to try it. I've never had decently priced sushi that actually tasted phenomenal. yes, PHENOMENAL, sooooooo fresh and you can differentiate each individual roll because it each has its own unique flavor. 

The staff is super friendly, the sushi chef always remembers me, and they have a great atmosphere. DEFINITELY recommend this place. MY favorite sushi place. I would drive from anywhere to acquire that fresh taste. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We discovered Yume about a year ago and it has become our go to sushi spot. Family owned, great service, fresh fish, generous sized rolls and excellent rice/noodle dishes. We have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"As good of a sushi as you could get given you're in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale we were on the hunt for our new Sushi hangout. Hubby being from San Fran likes the real deal. We tried a few that top the lists here but none compared to this little gem we just found. I don't know if Duke is the owner , but if he isn't he acts like he is in taking pride in this wonderful little restaurant. We stopped in on a week night & sat at the bar. Duke took over & our dinner was great. But what impressed me the most was he took my cell # to let me know when he got fresh Saba , which hubby loves. 
Usually , people are all talk no action. But sure enough he texted me a few days later that he got it in if we wanted to come in for dinner. As it turned out hubby was on his own that night & went. I couldn't wait to interview him when I got home. He said \" It was the BEST sushi he has ever ate \" well whoa...., hubby NEVER says that & has eaten sushi all over the world including Tahiti !! (He did say Hawaii was just as good ). So I was thrilled to hear this !! He said he will never eat sushi anywhere else !! 
Soooo thanks Duke & if you are not the owner than owner you need to thank Duke :). !'"}
{"text":"The more often I come, the more I like this restaurant.  That's why I'm changing the rating for this restaurant from 4 stars to 5.

Each time I come here, I'm greeted right away by a warm smile from the waitress.  This just goes to show you, a warm smile goes a long way to make a costumer feel welcome.

I'm sure the waitress can't be having a good day everyday like the rest of us, but she still always manages to give her costumers a great smile.

I continue to like the comp salad and miso soup.  Always warmly received by me. 
 
And I have to say, the sushi chef is clever.  Every time I've ordered their sashimi, it always comes with more slices than indicated on the menu.  The slices might be a bit thin, but as the costumer, I feel good because I feel like I'm getting just a bit more than what I ordered which makes me appreciate the place.

I agree with curious g.'s review that if the sashimi platter is dressed up a bit more with more varied vegetables, that would really bring the dish up a notch.

This last time my friend ordered the bebimbop and she said the dish was very good.

I hope this restaurant continues to improve and I hope the smiling waitress continues to work there."}
{"text":"I randomly stumbled upon Yume Sushi's grand opening tonight on my way back out to the parking lot from Uncorked Wine Bar (Yume is in the old Fat Burger location in the Scottsdale Promenade).  

I opened the door and received the warmest welcome that I think I have ever received in any bar or restaurant!  Every chef/server/staff in the restaurant turned around to great me -- very fun, and I hope they keep the energy up beyond their first night.

Yume has pretty standard sushi fare, but the happy hour specials might set them apart -- huge sashimi pieces for around $1.50 and rolls for $3-$4.  They don't have alcohol yet, but said they are hoping to get their license in January.  I hope they do since I think it will set them up for longer-term success.

I ordered a takeout tuna roll and some salmon/tuna sashimi (or I thought), and enjoyed the complimentary edamame during my wait.  The \"sashimi\" came out with rice, which is fine but I thought that was nigiri?  I was in a hurry so may have ordered incorrectly, I'll double check next time (may have been user error).  The sashimi/nigiri was far above average, really excellent flavor and exceeded my expectations -- perhaps some of the best salmon I have had, and the albacore was also very flavorful.  The roll was okay...I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and allow for the takeout-delay-factor.

Overall I would definitely go back to this place if I was looking for a more lowkey sushi spot than the nearby Ra, Sushi Brokers or Sapporo...but with Stingray opening at Scottsdale Quarters soon, Yume will need to work hard to stake out its claim in a very sushi-crowded North Scottsdale neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. They are super nice there an definitely make you feel welcome!  I got the chicken fried rice and I will tell you, it was the best I've ever had hands down. So good and fresh. If I wasn't so full I would have gotten more. Their edamame was super big and fresh as well and I wasn't sure I could finish it. Of course I did. The whole office loved their food and we will definitely be ordering there again"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my experience. Fresh sushi with friendly service. Nice decor. very clean."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken bento box was amazing. Sat at the bar and chatted with the owner who was so sweet and friendly. Funky atmosphere. Good music. Beautiful aquarium. I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"agh.  Not exactly what I would consider \"Korean\" food.  Ordered various sushi's, the chicken bulgogi, and the soft tofu stew.  When the chicken bulgogi came out, I explained that we did not order chicken teriyaki but the chicken bulgogi.  The waitress explained that they serve teriyaki for bulgogi because that is what \"American\" people like better.   Really?  Really?!  Sushi was not fresh and tofu stew less than mediocre.  Should have cooked at home.  When I say that, you have got to know the food was bad."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my dining experience here for lunch. Unfortunately, yelp led me here based on their overall 4 star review. Their service was bad. They barely acknowledged us, they took our order and never came by to ask how are things going. 

We ordered shrimp tempura appetizer, teriyaki beef bento box, and the bulgogi bento box. Here is what I liked: the bulgogi and the fried won ton. The edamame, the tempura shrimp, the California rolls and the teriyaki beef lacked flavor and barely edible. The teriyaki beef was hard and dry and the tempura shrimp tasted like batter (where was the shrimp?). Our bill was around $31 and certainly not worth it. Not sure if I'll be back, but if I do, I'll try specialty sushi rolls instead this time."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite sushi spot! I stumbled across this restaurant by accident and I'm so glad I did. I've been here 3 times in the last week. I can't get enough. It's not fancy by any means but who cares if the food is good.

I've tried several different rolls as well as the sashimi and have yet to be disappointed. Even their simple cucumber salad with (real) crab is fantastic. 

Great place to stop in and grab a delicious meal at a fantastic price!"}
{"text":"This place has very good Japanese food and sushi.  It's a little pricey but my favorite Japanese place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yumi is becoming a regular lunch spot for my coworkers and me, mainly because it's close-by and the bento box meals are a pretty good deal. 

I describe the place as a \"hole in the wall\" sushi joint for North Scottsdale. I say that because it's nothing like Ra or other cool sushi restaurants in the area. Yumi is a small, basic sushi joint. The location used to be a Fatburger, and the furniture appears to be diner-esque, so it's probably still the same. There's also a soda fountain smack in the middle of the place, which is not only distracting, but also unattractive. Moving the machine to the kitchen (where it belongs) would be a much needed improvement.

The people who work there all appear to be owners or friends of the owners, so you can tell that they're trying real hard to provide good customer service. I like how they great everyone who walks in the small joint, and immediately seat and serve a starter of miso soup and salad.

The bento boxes are reasonably priced--around $7--and they even come with four pieces of California roll--something that Ra Sushi and Sushi Brokers nearby don't do (but I always wished they did). The quality of the food is pretty decent. Not quite as delicious as Ra, but I think it's better than Sushi Brokers' bento boxes. Overall, if you're on a lunch break and have a hankering for a bento box, it's a decent place to go, and I hope that some future tenant improvements (moving the soda fountain) will help boost the experience up a notch."}
{"text":"We don't go here for the sushi, but for the Korean dishes.  Wish they offered more of them on the menu and wish they were still allowed to serve the tradition ban chan. Given that there are no other Korean restaurants in the area, it's our go to place in when we get a craving."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service here. Both people who were helping us were very rude and condescending. We got 2 rolls and 3 orders of sashimi and nothing was very impressive, tasted a little funky and later everyone felt ill, and my mother got full on food poisoning."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi and friendly service. The prices were very inexpensive and the portion were generous. My husband had the spicy tuna jalapeño poppers and he said it was one of the best sushi dishes he has ever had.  We will definitely return to Yume!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast service with the friendliest staff. Amazing sushi! Also very reasonably priced. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice that they're open all day,  don't close mid-afternoon.  Service very friendly.  Rolls and sushi good,  sashami not great."}
{"text":"Best sushi around! It's fresh and soooo yummy! The prices are amazing too!!! Jessica who works there is always so nice to me! I have been here many times and plan on going many more!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you're craving sushi but your spouse won't eat anything raw? Go to Yume!  

Definitely not the best sushi I've ever had but got my fix: sashimi salad was a big salad with mixed greens and thin slices of various fish. The dressing was acidic and not sweet like I expect most Sushi restaurants serve but decent. I also ordered the 9eleven roll which was spicy California topped with spicy tuna on top. It was good for me.

I ordered the spicy chicken bento box for my husband and bulgogi bento for my kids. Since it is Korean run I expected the Korean dishes to be good and they were. Spicy Chicken was cooked with Korean spicy red bean paste and the bulgogi was right on with perfect balance of sweetness that you should expect with rib eye. Completely devoured. 

Service: A
Sushi: B
Bentos: A
Value: B+"}
{"text":"Yuma is hands down some of best Sushi in Scottsdale. You're always greeted like you're family, the prices are excellent, and has some of the best happy hour in town. The sushi chefs are true artists at their craft and they will concoct any delectable sushi creations you can think of! Start with the jalepeño poppers and go from there. You will always leave yume full and happy!"}
{"text":"In Yume's defense, my review three years ago was five stars for them. I am updating it today as we just went there last night and service could be better. We've noticed service not being so hot in the past year but you know I just sort of turned a blind eye to it. Our waitress is the older lady that is supersonic fast - I'll name her flash but, she sacrifices service to do it. We entered around 7pm place was packed. They seated us quickly and a family left as we arrived -a good start. In just 1 minute, Flash arrives and wants to take our order, my husband said \"we just sat down.\" I recall free miso soup but that is no more. They ran-out of yellowtail which of course is the handroll i wanted. we ordered a teriyaki Bento and a chicken Katsu Bento and Salmon sushi rolls. Fresh fish tank is awesome. My husband is a great cook so he knows fresh cooking. his chicken was rubber-like as if pre-cooked and  stuff sitting and then fried or refried something was going on where it wasn't made to order. My husband asked for the bill and once it came he signed and in 5 seconds Flash came and grabbed the receipts - too quick and unnecessary in a then non- crowded place. If you can get past \"Flash\" and the poor katsu - you'll be fine. Personnally I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Yume Sushi Grill is a great spot! All of the sushi is very fresh, and they pride themselves in having great quality. The sushi chefs are knowledgeable in their craft, and also extremely friendly to have a chat with. They serve free salad and miso soup, and the serving staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive.

The Korean dishes are pretty authentic, and the home made kimchi is great! I recommend the bulgogi, bi bim bab, and spicy pork for meals. Lunch time is the best time to go, as their lunch specials are amazingly priced for the amount of food that you receive. 

The one complaint that I have is that they don't stock a few of my favorite kinds of sushi (although I know they aren't the most popular) mackerel, quail eggs, and surf clam won't be found on the menu."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Yume, it's better than the last. Fresh sushi, amazing flavors... The tempura veggies are to die for! I love the staff - this place is a gem. Thank you, Yume!"}
{"text":"Love, love this place! It's one of our favorite sushi places in town and we've been to a lot! Their tuna is always super fresh. We tried their shrimp fried rice on a recommendation and it was the best I've had. Have been craving it ever since!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we have found in Scottsdale since we moved here from San Diego. The fish is great! And so is the service. We were in on a Monday during happy hour and had the pleasure of the owner Jay as our sushi chef. It was a bit slow so we had him make us one of his own creations that aren't on the menu and it was sooo tasty! I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! The owner and staff we're so friendly and the sushi was fresh, unique, andeasily is the best in the area. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat sushi a lot you are going to have to spend a lot. It's easy to find a top shelf sushi restaurant in scottsdale, with prices to match. The real challenge is finding a sushi restaurant that is reasonably priced, but still really good. Yume fits that bill. Their sushi is really good, their rolls are tasty and priced right and their servers are super friendly and good. Yume is now our go to spot for a sushi fix. We eat until we are completely stuffed and still get out for under $75."}
{"text":"Take out for the first time. The beef was so old that you cannot even eat. The chicken has no flavor and worse than teriyaki chicken in Panda express, which is much more tender and tasty than this place.  Prior dine in experience was good but the take out is horrible. It's a nightmare."}
{"text":"Smaller place than I envisioned, but the atmosphere was inviting and comforting. My friend and I came here after seeing a movie and craving sushi. We ordered the Philly roll, Summer Crunch roll, yellowtail roll and Fire Cracker roll. We also ordered the Monkey Brains as the appetizer. I love cream cheese so I knew two of the dishes would be good already. I really liked the spicy mayo and eel sauce and shrimp in my sushi. Split a chocolate ice cream for dessert. I'd go back, staff was super friendly even when we ordered dessert late and they were getting ready to close."}
{"text":"I almost wish half stars or something were allowed in this system because I wouldn't say it was worth 3 stars but I wouldn't say 4 either because the sushi was maybe 4 out of 5 but everything else was just ok. The service was fine but the table felt unclean and either the miso soup I had or the bowl it was in smelled weird so I didn't finish it and my companion said the house salad was sub par. On the up side though the service was fast and the atmosphere was comfortable, wasn't too crowded, loud, or bright. Overall, it's just ok as a sushi place (compared to places in CA or HI) but considering how other sushi places in Arizona compare, I would say it's one of the better joints."}
{"text":"It was a rainy cold December Arizona evening and I was craving two things, 1) Udon noodle soup 2) Something different  that I haven't tried! Yume had been bookmarked for quite sometime and after checking out their reviews and seeing some solid udon noodle reviews I knew this was my go to spot that night!

I will have to say that Yume did more than satisfy my udon craving, their shrimp tempura was delicious, broth was flavorful and balanced, everything was perfect! I saw some some sushi dishes come out of their kitchen and they looked amazing! Can't wait to head back to Yume to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. I got the udon mixed seafood noodle bowl. It was delicious! Others at my table ordered the beef bulgolgi bento box and some sushi rolls. I tried the beef also and it was delicious and flavorful. The sushi was also great! Service was great as well. I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu next time I go! Would highly recommend for Korean /Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Even better service. I really have a hard time spending more money on sushi when Yume is htis good."}
{"text":"Great location, awesome atmosphere, outstanding customer service and delicious sushi!  Happy hour prices are awesome!  The monkey brains, jalepeno poppers and fish ball is a must try!  We will return!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the sushi is really good! Lots of options - many different rolls to choose from. They have all been very fresh. The service hasn't been the fastest either time I went there, but I understand that it can get busy. Everyone is friendly and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Besides great fish here, (YES THIS PLACE IS LEGIT)... Home of the ghost chili roll, not for the beginner. The ghost chili will either kill you, put you in the hospital, or give you a 30-minute trip to hell and back. You must sign a waiver before they will serve you this roll. If you can eat it in 30 minutes, you get your picture on the wall. There's a reason there are STILL only 5 picture on that wall.

Fresh product, well done.   At last! Some proper sushi up in this neighborhood.

+ masago, ikura fresh. Nigiri seaweed wrapper is crispy, dry and just the right flavor. Win.
+ spicy tuna roll made fresh, great flavor, just right consistency, subtle textures. Win. 
+ salmon skin roll. I do love a DING (instead of a beep)
+ unagi. Perfect. Again gotta love a ding!!

# tamago is on the menu, but not made in house. \"It's not popular up here.\"
# watch out for the front door. it is heavy and if you don't swing it wide enough, the giant steel pointed handle goes right into your rib!  note to self: don't be so eager! you'll get inside in a minute!

Now, about the GHOST CHILI CHALLENGE

Okay, so I can finally say I've had my taste of Ghost Chili. It is an experience like no other. The instant it touches your tongue, it's like someone set it on fire. And it just escalates from there. Up, up, up, up. Hotter. Hotter. The pain is excruciating. Naturally you swallow, but that was a mistake. You should have spit it out. Even with soy milk, the next 30 minutes are sheer agony. No amount of squirming, wringing of hands, gritting of teeth or yelling will help you.

And that was from one bite. There are but 5 pics on the wall, and according to chef, all of them had downed the roll in two or three bites. Mistake. An ambulance ride, and a night of morphene-induced sleep is your only escape. You must sign a waiver before you begin which includes a line warning of possible eminent death. WOW that was hot.

Having said it, I'm glad I tried it. Those who say you can take any level of spicyness, this Yume is your final resting place and without the 30-hour plane flight to India where they're grown."}
{"text":"I'm a little hesitant to review Yume, because as much as I love it, I also want to keep it a secret (love not having to wait to be seated ever). But I guess I won't be selfish. 

let's start with the TL;DR version: This place is great. Fish is fresh, well prepared, and prices are more than reasonable. The korean food is excellent as well, which is great if you have friends that aren't hot on the whole raw fish thing. 

Full Review: 
Been coming here for about a year now, and have never left unsatisfied or able to walk properly. Food is amazingly well prepared, fish is incredibly fresh, and the owner is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. One of the things I always miss about living back in SD is not good sushi, you can find that anywhere, but good AFORDABLE sushi. Sushi that is reasonably priced is a prized gem, and this place has it."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to go to for food and price and would go again hands down and the service was great. Sushi is amazing for the price it's a knock of the park."}
{"text":"they have one of the spicies sushi roll. they have the spicy sushi challange posted on the wall. definately can make your mouth scream for water. but unfortunately, because of the spicy tuna, they forgot the basic of sushi. quality and taste. 
yes with the spicy tuna, it will kill your taste bud. but I still do want to taste other than hot sauce.
the korean food there is better than the sushi."}
{"text":"Simple place, good food. Get the Mardi Gras roll."}
{"text":"So it's not the BEST sushi in the world, but it was good, fresh and very fast.  I enjoyed the caterpillar roll, and my dinner companions had yellowtail sashimi (which I had never had but now a great fan) and Ahi tuna roll (always a favorite)....
What I was most impressed with was our server, she was funny, attentive and very sweet.  Service goes a long way with me, and we didn't feel rushed (even on a Friday night, which they were only marginally busy) to leave after we were done eating (might have helped that we ordered a second round of beers though....)

I bought this on a Groupon, and was very impressed.  We will return and happily pay full price.  Good job Groupon for a great deal, and GREAT job Yume sushi for NOT treating us like a discounted customer!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great staff! I can not wait to go again. My 5 year old son loved everything we ordered and the sushi was fresh and delicious. I recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews on Yelp.  Pleasantly surprised.  Came for a late lunch ordered the spicy Cajun lobster roll, it was so delicious.  They have so many items on their menu it took a little time to figure out what I wanted.  Definitely will be back.  This is by far the best sushi I have had in Arizona so far."}
{"text":"Found this gem of a restaurant on restaurant.com and read the few yelp reviews before we decided to check it out. We were more then pleasantly surprised. 
They greeted us with complimentary miso soup and salad which was a nice first impression. They have a great variety of sushi rolls as well as Korean menu. We decided on two rolls and two entrees and we loved it all. The sushi is probably some of the best fish I've had in the valley. I haven't had fish that melts in your mouth since San Fran to be honest. 
Definitely check this place soon!!"}
{"text":"Holiday shopping with mom and she wanted to grab lunch close by. Place has a nice clean above average atmosphere for the majority of sushi places that are out there which can hold approx 50 ppl... Nice large salt water fish tank and good menu selection. Prices are competitive to what I have in San Diego. I got the Spicy chicken bento box & spicy tuna  roll and both did NOT disappoint!  Overall, great service, atmosphere and good quality!!!"}
{"text":"I really can't say one bad thing about this place at all! First time I went here everything was great from the food to the customer service. Went in for a second time and nothing changed! And I'm a huge fan of consistency when it comes to restaurants!

Right when I walked in the hostess/waitress greeted me kindly and even went the extra mile to converse with me and share a story about a date she had went on that went wrong since I was waiting for my date to arrive. Put me in such a good mood! 

Although my date took a while because google maps doesn't locate it correctly causing her to get lost, I still felt comfortable and taken care of until she arrived.

Once she arrived, the waitress immediately arrived to take our order and the food came out in I wanna say 15 minutes and the presentation was fabulous! It was delicious also! We had the salmon sashimi, TNT roll and Mardi Gras roll, and all were awesome.

So yeah, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"great place!
came here for dinner the night before a skating competition to get carb loaded.
california roll--very generous on the fillings of crab and avocado.  not overly riced.
spicy tuna roll--had a nice hint of sesame oil.  very good. 
chicken katsu--very nice thick cutlet of breast meat.  nice breading on the outside.  the thickness of the chicken was enough so that it balanced the breading.  the katsu sauce was very good.  also came with two pan fried gyoza which were tasty.
side salad--very simple and good, asian ginger/sesame type of vinagrette.  not heavy at all but tasty.
miso soup--very good.  standard.
the amount of food i ate was huge.  the total was only $30, but this more than enough food for two people."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, it wasn't extremely busy but had a decent crowd. The service was pretty slow. The rolls we ordered took a decent amount of time time. The quality was pretty good but not great by any means. Decent place, bout it."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!  I had dinner here the other day, and have to say that everything was fantastic.  The spicy crunch roll is unbelievable, and the half rainbow/half dragon was perfect.  I also ordered the salmon nigiri,  which was delicious but overkill as I was eating alone.  I'm embarrassed to admit that I also had edamame, which was salted with is always a plus in my book.  The fish was all tender and very fresh, and the customer service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Found this place accidently. Went around 5:30pm and it looked completely empty but we decided to try it out since we were there and they had a People Love us on Yelp sticker so why not? We sat at the bar and ordered off of the happy hour menu which is all reasonably priced. We got potstickers and 2 rolls for about $15 plus free miso soup. The fried shrimp roll we had was really good, I would go back just to get that. Everyone was very friendly and I thought it was really cool how a regular came in and the sushi chef (is that what you call them?) asked him if he wanted the regular. I think he ended up getting something different that another chef who came out from the back made for him last time. They also have a lunch special from opening until 2pm, not sure what it is though.

Update: The below has been cancelled but was still advertised in the restaurant. My friend called 6/25 to confirm.

I noticed that they have a spicy tuna challenge for \"the hottest cones\" in the valley. I recruited a friend who loves spicey food to do it so I'll be back to watch him do that. Apparently you get happy hour all the time if you complete it or you pay $25 for the dish if you can't."}
{"text":"Tried this little place out recently.  Would have never known it was there if it had not been for word of mouth.  Restaurant needs more visibility.  A Sushi bar that has fresh fish and awesome prices needs to be noticed.  The specials did not dissapoint in the slightest.  Handrolls were fresh and handed right to you from sushi chef,  Seaweed had that nice crunch to it.  Other fish items on menu were so fresh and delicious.  I do plan on coming back to write for some of my other publications"}
{"text":"We recently just heard this was supposed to be an awesome sushi place, so we tried it tonight to see what the talk was all about.  Wow, not many places live up to the hype we had read, but having been a sushi lover for the past 30 years, this place was as great as everyone exclaimed.  The ginger salad was an awesome start.  The miso was good but unremarkable.  Then came a number of sushi orders, the tuna, yellowtail and salmon melted in your mouth like butter.  The sliced ginger was as fresh and zesty as we have ever had.  The wine by the glass was an extremely good value.  Upon leaving we immediately called and told some close friends we had found gold in this sushi restaurant.  We can't wait to go back, way to go Yume!"}
{"text":"very delicious and very nice staff, such cute ladies, very sweet that work here...we had a whole assortment of rolls plus absolutely delicious salmon nigiri...so fresh the salmon was...it was divine heaven...we order 6 more pieces of it. The miso soup is wonderful also....very nice cute small place"}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for almost 30 years. There are two things I miss: my friends and the food. If you like sushi, Korean and Japanese food like how they make it in the islands, then you will love this place.

The only thing that makes this place difficult, it that they have so many menu items to choose from! I guess that just means that I will have to keep going back!!"}
{"text":"I went here twice.  The food was good the first time though service was sketchy (they were looking at their smart phones and I had to get up and go get the waitress) but the service was incompetent the second time.  Slow to bring a simple cucumber salad and they lost my sushi order.  They then put the order in but at the end of the queue.  After a half hour more wait I finally got up and left."}
{"text":"The seaweed wrap around the sushi roll was extremely difficult to chew. The prices were higher than what was advertised online. There was no happy hour, but I'm certain I read about one. The presentation didn't hold a candle to the photos I saw on Yelp for this restaurant.

I feel like this restaurant may have gone through an owner change recently because it didn't live up to reviews. There also seemed to be many changes."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star place. These are the places I visit the most. 5 star are where I take people who visit or go for special occasions. For me, this is a place when you just want good food at a good price and can support a smaller business. This is a hangout place for sure. First time here and we've lived less than a mile away for 2 years. 

I won't say it's the absolute best food, but for a local joint close by, this hits the spot. Will be back often when I need my sushi fix."}
{"text":"We flew in for the weekend, were tired and wanted have dinner close to our hotel. Very good food! Would be a regular if we lived here!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Alaska (Alaskans think they're sushi connoisseurs) and I must say, I was very impressed by the quality of the sushi! It was fresh and delicious, almost as good as back home ;)

I appreciated the various sizes of sashimi plates and the variety of rolls, dishes and sushi. I wish I had more time here to try other dishes but my first impression is a solid 3 stars. 

Service was friendly but I wish it was more attentive. Our seating hostess/ waitress took our order after taking the order of two tables that came after us, our waters were never refilled and the table was quite sticky from previous diners. 

It was also unclear on how they want you to order. We marked on the menu with a red pencil they gave us and then handed our menu to the waitress. I think that's what they want you to do? 

All in all I do recommend Yume because the quality is decent and the pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was good probably the best I've had here in Az. The happy hour menu was what you except or find at most sushi places in Az. The price range  for rolls were $4.95 to $9.95 per the waitress prices all day no specials. Dragon roll melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"I've visited Scottsdale a few times, but never noticed Yume....tucked away in the Promenade shopping center is this jewel. I've been yelping around and found a great place Hiro's, but it's a lot farther away from Hayden/kierland area. I paid twice the price for Hiro's  vs Yume....for the same items!
Service was great, spicy tuna sushi was awesome,and the prices are unbeatable...quite an extensive  sushi, Japanese and Korean dishes...I'm comin back!"}
{"text":"Ah-ha I just found my new favorite sushi restaurant. Fresh food and reasonable prices. What more could I ask for especially with Japanese food. Little strange at this place where you mark your menu for the food that you want. Little different and nice change from your normal restaurant. 
There most popular menu item is the Bento Box. We had the Ginger Pork box and the Teriyaki Chicken box. The pork was thinly cut with so much taste and fresh. The chicken was all white meat and very juicy. The boxes comes with a salad, California roll, mini egg rolls, rice, and your meat. Can't beat the price $6.95. Oh yea, the meal comes with miso soup. Really good soup. Not too salty. 
We also ordered the eel roll, dragon roll, rainbow roll. They were all so fresh. Really enjoyed the sushi. 
The only problem here was that their booth for four was a little small because they bring you so much food. 
Service was very good and filled our water glasses on time. There was only one waitress but she gave really good service. We really enjoyed the meal there and can't wait til we visit again."}
{"text":"I have never had anything to complain about at this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly from the owner Jay to his right hand man Duke. They have the freshest selection in town and are able to personalize and customize any order to really make you feel like you are part of their family. For a restaurant in North Scottsdale located in the Promenade there is no where better to go from the quality to the pricing. Don't worry if you don't like sushi(like my girlfriend), they have some amazing kitchen food as well that will keep everyone happy. The location is perfect and you are missing out if you do not get a chance to experience what they have to offer."}
{"text":"We started with the normal edamame and dumplings which were ok. The Spicy Tuna roll was good but the surprise was the Cajun Lobster Roll and the TNT Roll. They were absolutely fantastic with the right amount of heat, mayonnaise and seasoning. Worth the trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I am for one, very very glad,

there is finally a Korean place in scottsdale.  YES, you heard me, a Korean place, not a Japanese Place.  

Lunch specials are pretty legit.  Bento boxes starting at 6.95.  Comes with salad and soup, good portions of the main item, rice, four california rolls, deep fried korean dumplings (mandoo), and tempura vegetables.

The sushi reminds me of the Korean loose rice sushi back from the Bay Area, its nice to have a taste of the Bay Area in Scottsdale from the Korean owners here.

I mean, don't get me wrong, Koreans and Chinese have good Sushi places too, but they arn't Japanese.  So know your differences in Sushi before you comment on things like Yume is not as good as places near by like like RA or Sushi Brokers, it makes you uneducated.  

if anything people need to know, RA and Sushi Brokers and Sapporo on the lowest end of Japanese places...  

and if you wanted authentic sushi, you would only know that Toyama is the best in Scottsdale, hands down... other great places like Hiro and Sushi Ko are Japanese Sushi bars; owned and ran by Japanese folks.

five stars to the first Korean place in Scottsdale, Kalbi, Bulgogi, and Bi bim bop for lunch.

five stars to the krew that works there, the ladies that serve you are super nice and keeps an eye out for our needs, tea cups were always full.

five stars to the food, it is exactly what is supposed to be a Korean sushi place; with variety of good cooked Korean items on the menu.

five stars for a completey crazy affordable price.  For a real cooked and sit down meal, at 6.95 bento box, not even the cheapest of the cheap fast food makes any sense anymore if you are eatingon the budget.

highly recommended.

Kamsahamnida!!"}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna roll. Love this place!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been so excited about a restaurant.  We went here twice in one week. 

The atmosphere is good.  About 5-6 booths with tables as well.  Sushi bar seating.  Bright blue neon lights... at first were a bit bright, but I got used to them.  There is a large salt-water fish tank that is awesome to look at and the kids were taken-away with the fish.  Nemo & Dory live in the tank.

We walked in and there really isn't a lobby/waiting area.  No hostess, but the waitress will seat you.  No wait on a Saturday evening.  The restaurant was about half full.  (The second time we went, the restaurant filled up while we ate... was about 3/4 full).  We were promptly served.  There seems to be 2 waitresses.  An older woman and a younger women.  The are both very polite; however, the older woman is a bit of a firecracker!  In a good way... she builds very good repore and tells jokes and tells you what's a better deal to get on the menu.  I adore her!

The menu is pretty extensive, lots of specialty rolls to choose from along with the classic rolls.  I love this about sushi restaurants.  Lots of new things to try out.  They also have a regular food menu that has a great array of asian foods.  Bento plates, udon soups, appetizers, fried rice, katsu, etc.  Great choices for people who have different tastes.  Since we went twice, I'm going to post all the choices we had... we did not order all this food in one sitting.  

This is a star based system.  
1 star = Bad
2 stars = mediocre, won't order again
3 stars = good
4 stars = Will order again and again and again
Pot stickers: **
Sunset roll (inside out with tempura shrimp, spicy tuna on top drizzled with spicy mayo and topped off with jalopeno slices: ****
Tuna nigiri: **** (SO FRESH)
Chicken Katsu Bento: ****  (awesome price for a TON of food)
Veggie Udon: ***** (5 stars... the broth is out of this world)
Chef's choice 5 pieces $7.00: Holy moly delish... all fresh tasting and loved the white tuna. Melted in our mouths.

Sake bombers are $6.00 all the time. Loves it!

With only two waitresses, we had amazing service, always tended too, waters/drinks always refilled and we enjoyed the repore they built with us...  

Also, GOING GREEN?  Yes, they have nicely laminated menus and provide wax pencils so you can choose what you want, (check it off) right on the menu. Brillant and saves alot of paper.  Go them!

I absolutely love this place and I hope that this local small business has great success!!!  They are absolutely doing everything right. Fresh food and impeccable service for a small joint.  

Do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Yume = Yummy  (sorry but I had to...)   We enjoyed a dinner here with relatives who know sushi.  We all loved trying the unique creations as well as the regular \"go-to\" rolls.  We wore a big wasabi smile all night - great dinner and good times.

The décor was reminiscent of a 50's diner, complete with big booths, neon lights and a really stunning saltwater fish tank that provided much entertainment and conversation.  The place was fresh and clean and the service was fast and friendly.  

We ate inside but had to check out the patio area when we left.  It was surrounded by charming lighted trees and provided some great pics.  It wasn't busy but it was a Tuesday night and I think it should be packed because the sushi was really beautiful and tasty!  We ordered several rolls and some nigiri - everything was fresh.  Iced tea was fresh, too.

There was plenty of parking (again Tues night?) and the value was quite reasonable.

I would definitely come back and I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"Pretty Impressed with this place. It was a smaller place but every seat was filled from the bar to the tables n booths. Every roll we had was fresh and our Sushi Chef (Duke) was awesome. We will be back for sure....it's our new spot.  Say good bye to Sushi Brokers and hello Yume Sushi!"}
{"text":"Located in a sort of strip mall, Yume has an unassuming exterior, but don't let that fool you! Yume has delicious fresh sushi and savory bento boxes. I tried the spicy tuna and Phoenix roll. Both combined the perfect amount of fresh fish and spice! The beef bento box was filled to the brim with tasty offerings. Overall I see Yume becoming one of my new favorite hidden spots!"}
{"text":"Ugh the food is sooo fresh and so good you can't go wrong here.. if your a die hard sushi fan! Their happy hour menu is still a little pricey but still a good deal and worth it for the quality of all their food. It's a beautiful place especially for a date. I would recommend it! :) and nice staff !"}
{"text":"This is the most AMAZING sushi place i have ever been to. Its not fancy or high end, but the prices are great, the food is terrific, but by far my favorite part is the outstanding service. The Miso Soup and salad with ginger dressing that come with every meal are delicious! And I could eat their crunch rolls all day long!

love love love"}
{"text":"Typically my mark of a good sushi place is the quality of their fish in either the sushi dinner or sashimi dinner.  Nowadays it's too easy to mask the quality of fish in a roll that has a million other different things loaded in it. 

Needless to say, fish was sub-par in taste and freshness.  I may yet go back just to try the rolls, because the service really was great and the restaurant itself was trendy.  But I wouldn't bank on getting the sashimi again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best sushi in Scottsdale, amazing sushi chefs, and not concerned about fancy...welcome to Yume. The Korean menu throws people off a bit- but this little strip mall gem is all about fresh fish. If you want to order a solid Bimbimbap- you can do that too.

Service is second to none. Duke and Jay hold this place down. Be careful if you aren't a Bengals or a Raiders fan...but come anyways for the best sushi and football banter in the area. Girls- grab a great cold sake and relax...let your man enjoy the conversation. I have never recommended a sushi bar more highly.

We chose two rolls - the Horizon and the TNT. By the time the last bite of the TNT hit our lips, we left it up to the chef. He made us the cucumber paradise right out of the gate. Fresh fish wrapped in cold cucumber and showered with flying fish roe. I can die peacefully now. Top that one off with The Number 52, heaven is in reach.

I'm a sucker for food. My husband is a sucker for football. We both love and appreciate sushi. This is by far some of the best sushi we've had in our lives. The service was icing on our cake.

In a part of town where chain restaurants and strip malls dominate...we found our oasis."}
{"text":"Many of the descriptions and summaries on the yelp website are misinforming guests. It offers no delivery and the online ordering system does not work. It may not be the restaurants fault, but I am tired of the wrong information on the website."}
{"text":"Art you can eat! I walked here yesterday and was crushed bc it was closed on Sundays. I'm so glad I had one more night in AZ and came back. Deliciously fresh!! I sat at the bar and the chef started rattling off what he had and I asked for chirashi with all he said (off the menu). White tuna, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, crab, and egg. He topped it off with flying fish egg roe and a quail egg in the middle. Can this guy read my mind? SUPERB!!"}
{"text":"It was 8 pm on a Friday night and we practically had the place to ourselves. The decor is funky- it's like a 50's style diner crossed with a sushi bar- and so is the menu. Funky is good.

I don't know about you, but Happy Hour prices make me happy. $5 sake bombers and $3 and $4 rolls ain't bad at all. 

There is a roll on the menu with albacore, asparagus, and a vinegar sauce that I thought was different than the usual offerings at local sushi bars. The chef used some Korean style chili paste for the Tiger roll that set it off nicely. 

Overall a great value and I shouldn't have ordered that bottle of Soju at the end of the meal but  it was calling my name."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday and it was great. I like trying out specialty rolls at new sushi places. I got a Twinky and it was great. Although I was kinda expecting it to be yellow."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a pleasant blend of Japanese and Korean with the Japanese in the lead. The food is pretty much what you expect but nicely prepared. My wife's sashimi salad was quite impressive. The fish was varied and fresh. My bento box was nicely balanced. However, I would have liked more wasabi and more ginger in the salad dressing, to say nothing of less water. Still the overall box was enjoyable, especially the sauces. The ambiance is dark and quiet despite the tv on the wall. Certainly worth a visit when you're in that Asian mood."}
{"text":"Was very hopeful of finding a new asian place so close to our house.  This used to be a Fatburger.  (You can still see original fatburger retro tables, metal backsplash and soda machine lol) Mmmm! A Korean/Japanese place! Korean owned! They have at least got to have killer Korean food right? WRONG! The beef bulgogi was WAY WAY off. What small amount of beef that came on our plate was thickly sliced, saturated in meat tenderizer, and came on top of a bed of vegetables. Bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms with Bulgogi? Never had it like that before. It was more like a bad stir fry. It looked pretty though, that's about it. We also ordered one of the rolls that was topped with eel. The eel was undercooked, slimy, and just plain gross. The spicy tuna and crabmeat mix inside the roll was off too.  It just did not taste fresh. The yellowtail and scallion roll was the best, but still not anything to write home about. The soft shell crab roll was pretty horrific as well. The eel sauce had a funky sickly sweet flavor that lingered in a bad way. It just didn't taste right.  We also ordered the chicken fried rice. That was pretty clean, light in flavor, but overly black peppered. Black pepper in fried rice? Me thinks not!  If they switch over to WHITE PEPPER the fried rice would be more edible.  All three of us were so glad that we didn't order more, and left very disappointed.   

The rice is cooked perfectly! A+++! The staff is super nice.  I just wish they would serve more traditional Korean fare...and serve fresher sushi!"}
{"text":"Was in the area so my friend and I came here for lunch.  I ordered the Korean dish, bi bim bap.  It was sooo good!  Just like my mom makes it.  The only difference is the red chili paste sauce they give you is far less spicy then it would normally be.  They modified to satisfy those who are not used to the \"ethnic hot\" as I like to call it.  I wish they had a location closer to me!  I crave the food here all the time!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous fish tank. I had tempura and sushi--all good!"}
{"text":"Easily 5 stars! I was expecting decent priced bento boxes and expensive sushi. I was also expecting either a fast food type place or a traditional Japanese style with the decor and soft music. I was wrong on both. Walking in I was a bit surprised it is a nice little place that feels like a bar without all the drunks. I was seated and brought ice water with lemon. Tasted like it had been sitting with a few lemons and was really good. I looked at the menu and was beyond shocked. All the sushi was $4.95. Be it nigiri, a CA roll or the fancier rolls. I kept that in mind as I ordered my bento and miso soup. The soup came first and I was kinda sad to see only a couple pieces of seaweed and no tofu. But it was only $1.50... then I got the bento. About $8 for a scoop of nicely prepared rice a juicy chicken filet cut with light but enough teriyaki sauce on top of some veggies, some edamane, a nice salad, a mini egg roll that was decent a gyoza that was actually done right... most places I don't like them and 4 piece CA roll. The roll was good so I decided to go for the Vegas. Yum! Not too hot and just the right amount of crispiness in the light breading. It may be a far trip but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! The reviews are right, this place is great! The salmon sashimi is wonderful. The place was packed but only a 15 minute wait to get a table. Service was top-notch even though they were busy. Nice cozy feel to the place. Perfect for a lunch or dinner with friends. Not crazy expensive. And well drinks are a great price. I will be back!"}

{"text":"Favorite new sushi spot! FREE woOhoO! Miso soup! Excellent happy hour selection of food (not as extensive a selection on drinks, but they're already reasonably priced, eg. wine $4.) Everything tasted wonderfully fresh and the service was authentic.

The enormous tank with colorful salt water fish and bright clean water enlivens a space that I'd describe as \"soda-shop-modern sushi diner.\"  Does that conjure an image? Whether I'm wrong or right about the description, go check it out and then let me know. If you crave an ice cold Coke while you're there, then my imagery has legs.

(PS nice outdoor patio!)"}
{"text":"I love their Chicken Bento boxes paired with a variety of sushi!  The owners/employees are friendly, efficient and consistent.  The Bento boxes are a good value-offering much more than the typical Bentos in town.  We love their Green Tea as well.  They always give us a to go cup for the road.  My only suggestion-open at 11 on Saturdays-and open on Sundays!  I know you need a day off-but oh how I crave you-and it always seems like it is on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I had the seafood pancake and tofu soup.  They don't quite make it like other traditional Korean restaurants.  The pancake was made of mostly eggs and not of any flour base.  Takamatsu makes this 1000x better.  The tofu soup was bland and was spiced with chopped jalapenos instead of traditional Korean spices.  Chodang and Hordori makes the best tofu soup in the valley.

I guess I won't be coming back here for Korean food anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been back a few more times now and have really been happy with the service and the food.  I recommend looking at the specials board.  Last time we got the stuffed Orange (rice wrapped in Salmon topped with spicy tuna).  Came with 2 huge pieces and was wonderful.  Also tried their other special roll, forget what it was called byt basically shrimp tempura with battered snapper with avocado, asparagus"}
{"text":"Nice waitresses and very cheap happy hour. Is the fish super fresh and was the food memorable? Not really, but you pay for what you get - and given that the happy hour is such a bargain, this place is very decent."}
{"text":"I love their sashimi bowl with kochujang dressing on the side.   Plus their tofu soup is absolutely delicious!  Their service is always excellent and I've literally never had a dish here that I didn't really enjoy.   Even their bibimbap is awesome.   This is the only Korean place in Scottsdale that my Korean mother always wants to come to.  Plus they are reasonably priced!   I highly recommend you try this place out!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed. The food was OK - too much flavoring for sushi.  It should accent, not cover up the fish.  
Service was poor; generally inattentive. 
Music was too loud; pop music took away from the atmosphere in my opinion."}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants that makes you feel totally welcomed and Yume is one of them. It's like going over to your relative's house for a home cooked meal. The food doesn't disappoint either. It's one of my son's and my favorite lunch spots. They have excellent bento boxes. 
They give you a crayon to mark your selections on the laminated menu, but be carful not to get too crayon happy. We always tend to order too much food. 
They have excellent udons here. The owner is Korean so you will find many Korean dishes here too. Just mix and match your favorite Korean dishes with some sushi/sashimi and you can't go wrong.
Just remember, they are closed on Sundays. I found myself many times in front of Yume on Sundays very disappointed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for six years where I met my lovely wife. I fell in love with the cuisine while living in Seoul. My wife, being a native, is also rather fond of the food. We can honestly say that Yume is as good as it gets. From the bulgogi to the chigae, the food is authentic, the portions are generous, the service is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. If you don't like Yume, then you don't like Korean food."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good sushi place! My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place while tuning erroneous and we were both very impressed! The sushi is fresh and very tasty!! The service was very good and everyone who works there is super sweet! The prices are also awesome!! Can't beat good sushi for a good price! I will definitely  be coming back!"}
{"text":"Whaaaa??!?! Free Miso soup and salad?!! I will have to remember that next time I go... were not offered to me :( I guess those are perks that must be specifically requested....

I DID Order the shrimp tempura and a few rolls. They came out Super fast. It was like a quarter before 5 and there was no one else in the restaurant...  I was surprised by this as they have a pretty decent happy hour and it is in effect 7 days a week!

The staff is very Friendly. The items are well priced. And overall, the whole place felt very Clean. 

Will definitely go back ~ A nice change from all those huge sushi chains."}
{"text":"So rude! Came at 8:30 pm and said they're closing, their kitchen is closed, driving you away. I don't care if their food is good like what others say but you don't shoo your customers away!!!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and happy hour and am always looking for a great sushi spot and I think it's safe I found my favorite in the Scottsdale valley. Great service, great sushi, lots of options and prices are even good too! I have nothing to complain about and I've been here a few times and will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding? $6.95 - $9.95 for a Bento Box, great buy especially in Scottsdale. Shared the Chicken Teriyaki, Galbi, Salmon Bento Box which included Miso Soup, Pot Sticker, Rice, Salad, California Roll, enanabe and the entree meat which is a generous portion for everyone. We also tried the dragon roll which was very good. One person waits and serves all tables so would recommend going on off hours. Not the easiest place to find, it is located on the East side of where Fatburger used to be. Will be going back here more often because of the quality, quantity and low price of the food"}
{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed. There is a good selection of sushi rolls for every type of taste bud. The Mardi Gras is to DIE for!! Prices were decent for the quality. Great atmosphere and perfect for a date night. I will definitely be back very soon!"}
