{"text":"Wandered in today to watch some of the Steelers game. We ordered some spinach and artichoke dip which came out with greasy tortilla chips and was cold to lukewarm. We asked if they could heat it up and after waiting another ten minutes we were given another batch of lukewarm dip. I was starving so we stayed for some Mac and cheese which again was... You guessed it... Lukewarm. Since no bartender felt compelled to check on us at any point, we let sleeping dogs lie, cashed out and left. Will. Never. Return."}
{"text":"Awesome. From the time we stopped in we had great service. The Mgr Britney was so accommodating in trying to find our local team game on one of their many many tv's. Our bartender/server Andrea was so nice and professional. The bar was PACKED but she managed to check on us frequently. We ordered the Goat Chz Crostini which came out appropriately quickly and were fabulous."}
{"text":"First time I wrote a review on yelp because poor management inspired me to say something. The only reason why this place still exists is the location. I can see it really struggling when more dining options arrive to the North Shore as expected. Convenience only goes so far with terrible service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"BZ has a great happy hour and a good selection of draft beer.  I typically stick to drinks and appetizers and I have never had a problem.  I would avoid BZ when the Pirates are in town unless you like LONG waits for food and drink."}
{"text":"Excited about the new place in the northside.  Finally have a place to drink Sunday night.  Great beer selection. Had a burger which was done extremely well. Only down side was no one was here.  People help support this bar.  Pirates season will be amazing but I don't want them to reduce the hours.  How many times were you looking for a chill place to eat and drink on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Spotty service and neither of our salads came with what was on the menu. The pear and bleu cheese salad came without bleu cheese and the Greek salad came with red onion and goat cheese and nothing else. Just not good."}
{"text":"I am a turkey burger fan, but sometimes am not happy bc they can be hard to keep juicy. Well not at BZ's! The Turducken is sooo good!! Since I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, every time I visit, I have to have it! It's a turkey burger with shredded duck confit, a fried egg, arugula, and a sage aioli. So perfect you don't need to add mustard or anything.
The service is always great. Bc it's located on the North Shore, naturally it's busy during events and games. But in my opinion, it's the best place down there to get food before a game or event. Great beer selection and also good prices."}
{"text":"basically hated the fact that we were there. didn't want to help us eat delicious food m, so we left after paying $12 for soda and a bud light."}
{"text":"Perfect end to our evening out... after getting back from our concert we were hungry. Luckily the kitchen was open late, we ordered the Kobb Salad~ it was Amazing!!! We are heading out tonight but will be back to try the entr√©es."}
{"text":"Came in after a game and it was surprisingly slow. Not many people here yet it still took 20 minutes to get our drinks each round if they remembered to bring them at all. Didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"Great location! Great construction and set up, brand new bar, huge improvement from \"Firewaters\".  BZ will soon be the best bar/resturant on the North Shore. Open up those garage doors, fill the patio and entire bar with fans, pre games, games, and post gamers. Perfect location. Management staff is excellent, open, and friendly.  Great jod Brandon and Matt. This bar has great service and great food. Inovative items you must try. i.e. Turducken burger!  Great beer selection with inventive and wonderful mixed drinks. But the main reason I keep coming back is because of the excellant service and company of the two bartenders, Amanda and Brittney!  Those 2 are the best. The nights they tend bar are usually when BZ has its most customers. Props also need to be given to bartender Luke who is also a great addition to the mixologists behind the bar.  I have never been dissappointed by a visit to BZ."}
{"text":"Great place to pre game ! Great grilled cheese and beer options ! Very cool and friendly wait staff !"}
{"text":"By far the worse dining experience I've ever had. Slow service with a 45 min wait for our food that was TERRIBLE!!!! If your thinking of saving money by going there to eat before the game DON'T!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!!! It taste horrible and it took forever!!!! We were going to the baseball game , We had kids with us and by the time they finally brought the disgusting  food out they were restless. Bz also brought all the food late, and at one time, including appetizers and meal. On top of all that they didn't bring one of the kids meals untill about 5-10 mins of us already having our food. Our food was cold when it did finally come out the order was messed up. The manger did take money off our bill for all the mix up. But take it from me, save your money and time. It was a horrible experience and the food was horrible as well. I will never eat there again !!!"}
{"text":"Great location. The salads were good. My son enjoyed his burger. The service was very friendly but the food was very slow to arrive. We came at lunch. Would be better for young professionals after work."}
{"text":"The Terducken burger is the single greatest sandwich I have ever tried!!!  I am furious that I don't live closer so I can get 1 every week."}
{"text":"This was the first time we ate here.  It was about 3:00 PM and the Pirates game started at 7:00 PM.  The service was slow and the food was okay, I liked the French fries but the other two in my party did not.  They were thinner French fries with a sprinkle of rosemary on top.  I had the BLT which was decent.  The selection is limited and they serve different sandwiches/items from Tilted Kilt or Mullen's."}
{"text":"Went in the other day it was pretty busy for the pirate game, brendon was our bar tender, he suggested some great apps and also got me to even try the bacon vodka! will surely come back."}
{"text":"Just moving into the area, I came across this place and thought that BZ could be my nice little new hangout to come to after a long days work to catch a game and grab a few cheap beers. It does seem like a fitting place, but it kind of pissed me off when I went in there last night. Every single TV at the bar was tuned to March Madness and all I wanted to do was watch the Pens game. I kindly asked the bar keep if he could switch a TV for me to the Pens game and he said its on that TV over there. So one TV in the corner of the restaurant had the game on it and you couldn't even of sat at the bar to see what was happening on it. I could have understood more if the place was jam packed with people wanting to watch the March Madness games, but on a Thursday night at 9pm and only 3 people at the bar and a few TV's even showing the same game, I shoot the bar keep a look like really bud? But lo and behold the Pens game was still not put on so I had to squint with my eyes across the whole restaurant to watch. I thought about leaving and going next door to the Beermarket cause it was just one of those days and the majority of their TVs in there had the Pens game on when I walked by, but who wants to pay 6-8$ for a cold one...

That being said, they did have a cheep Miller Light 2$ ponder on special for March Madness so after a few of those my mood lightened up a bit. I also ordered a plethora of food throughout the evening. I started off with some wings, ehhh I'll pass next time. Pretty generic wing and hot sauce all around there. Plus for $11 I'd like to get more than ten pieces...Next up was the Truffle Fries. They were sprinkled with truffle oil, parsley, Parmesan cheese and some kind of lemon butter spread. Honestly I scarfed these down pretty quickly. They were delicious! Finally I settled on the Beef Sliders which were equally as good as the fries. 

Besides being a little pouty about the Pens game not being able to be put on, I'll continue to come back here again since its within walking distance of my place and try some of the other sandwiches, burgers, and apps on the menus. Being a hot wing kind of guy, I think I'll pass on their wings though as they seemed pretty generic, but they do have a nice liquor and cocktail bar menu with a ton of drafts on hand if that's more your thing too. 
I'm sure this is a cool place to come and pregame for before a Steelers or Pirates game as well.
I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could...Its not bad, its not great...but it could be better.

May your drink always stay cold!
Yours truly, the Shaw...."}
{"text":"Slooooow service. 20 min just to get a water. Food was mediocre at best and over priced."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location on the North Shore by the Stadiums and Beer Market but their menu is disappointing.  We went in hoping to order a few appetizers and they do not have much too choose from-fries, cheese sticks, bruschetta and that was about it.  The menu is just ok and we opted out of ordering appetizers and my date instead ordered the BLT sandwich with avocado.  The fries it came with were cold and McDonald quality.  The redeeming quality about this place is the beer list!  Lots of great beers on draft and bottle. I went with the Summer Shandy.  Our waitress was great and it wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great new North Shore bar!

Some co workers and I decided to check out this new addition to the North Shore, It just opened this month and is located in part of the former Firewater's North Shore Saloon across from PNC Park. They are open daily from 11 to 2am. With about 20 flat screens on the wall they are a great place to catch the game. They offer a ton of different drafts and great specialty cocktails. My favorite so far is the Thai Coconut Tea. Simply delicious!

They offer some type of drink special Monday through Friday. Food choices include all of the bar staples, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, wings, sliders, fried shrimp, fries and much more. I haven't had a chance to try any of the food yet but, I can't wait to try some.

All in all they are a great addition to the much needed bar scene on the North Shore."}
{"text":"I hardly ever go out to this part of the city, but my friend dragged me here to an EDM night during the week.  The bar was actually pretty huge, but everything was oddly pretty quiet that night.  The bartender was nice, music was ok (though it took over 2 hours for the DJ to set up).  I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have better drink specials.  I probably won't stop in here again unless a friend convinces me before/after attending a game."}
{"text":"First of all let me start off by saying, the stars have NO REFLECTION ON QUALITY OF FOOD. The food here is delicious and I have been here a number of time since its located right down the street from the office I work at. I have even brought a group of co-workers to experience the new bar in town and they too love the food....what we hate is THE SERVICE. Dont go by the specials on their sign because we saw the sign that said tuesday bbq and canned beer special and when we asked about it she said they had no special that day...You get seated quickly and your drink order gets put in and comes back out fast, your food order is also taken quickly but the wait for food in my opinion was a long wait. Considering we were there before the lunch rush and there were only about 5 other tables with people there for lunch. The staff, im not sure where the picked up the girls but they are awful, we would have bought more beer had she asked if ANYONE needed a refill. We all ate our food and finished our drinks and by the time she came back over she looked at the table and started taking plates and said \"i will be back with the checks\" not even enough time to stop her to ask for another drink so we didnt. Needless to say we wont be going for a happy hour stop off but the food is delicious. I wish the waiting staff would have done a better job so i could have given this place all the stars it deserves."}
{"text":"One of the worst service experiences. We were seated outside at a dirty table which the hostess starters to clean but stopped midway. When the server came over, she knocked over a dirty water glass and spilt water all over my phone and jeans. She left broken glass at our table. She offered to buy us a round of beers. 20 minutes later she came back without any drinks. She took our orders. Another 20 minutes before any beers. (There are still dirty glasses and bottles from the previous customers). The table was cleared and wiped almost an hour into us being there. When she finally brought our check, it had incorrect charges or thing a we never purchased and those beers she offered for spilling things - she charged us for. It was a busy night and they seemed short staffed but broken glass, spilled water, and a waitress more interested in talking to her roommates that stopped by made for a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Good food: tried a burger: well cooked, good state, liked the originally of the recipe. 

They have a decent selection of beers on tap. 

Service is OK. 

The only complaint I can make is about the noise level: they blast TV, I guess it is part of the ambiance. I would not bring a first ate there for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new restaurant so far  for 2013.   They just recently open so I went down to give it a try.  

The thing I love about them is that if you want traditional bar food: burgers, pizza, mac and cheese -- you can get it.  But if you feel you want something a little different, they have traditional foods with a twist.  

My favorite dish I had here was the Mexican Mac & Cheese.  It contain mac, cheese, goat cheese, and chorizo .  It is AWESOME.  It is so tasty.

Their duck sliders were very good and I hate duck.  Their skinny fries are tasty and not overly salted.  I am not a drinker but my friends raved about their cocktails.  I tried my table mate's turducken burger which was good.

At the end of the meal, we had a s'more cheesecake.  Yes, s'more cheesecake.  This is by far the tastiest cheesecake I have ever tried.  Seriously, I love that they didn't skimp on the crust. and the s'more on the top of it was just so good.  

I don't know if I can try anything else when I come back.  Because all I want now is that Mexican Mac & Cheese and S'more cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly service. A big shout to Holly! She is awesome!!!! Bartender extraordinaire.... and don't forget the Plethora of beer choices. This is my first time in Pittsburg but I sure know where to hang out next time"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Pittsburgh and went away to school in Columbus and just recently discovered bz's and I'm so glad I did. My friends and I decided to stop by after going downtown and we were all definitely pleased. The food came out hot and tasted awesome. Our server Michael was great  too, really attentive and personable. Definitely going back now that I'm home for good!"}
{"text":"Been there twice for lunch during business hours, service is always fast and friendly, had the same young lady each time, really attentive and nice.

Have had their Turducken Burger, California Chicken Club, and Buffalo Chicken Soup... always tastes good and fresh, the soup is def ambitious, but a bit odd.

Overall I would recommend for anybody in the area, they are really great about rotating the business lunch crowd and prices are very good"}
{"text":"Ok bar. I guess it was better than the other places I visited. Nothing special, but the drinks were pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Had the turducken burger. Burger was moist, duck was great and the egg was cooked well. Could have used a little more sage aioli, but other than that it was solid. Substitued fries for mac n cheese. Worth the dollar up charge. 

Pros:
Food was solid
Not very busy on a Wednesday for dinner
Decent beer selection

Cons:
Bartender said there is only a happy hour on Wednesday.

Overall a solid place for food near the stadiums. Should be fun once the pirates start playing."}
{"text":"UPDATE - Tried BZ's again, this time with my lovely wife.  It was really good.  Here are some real positives:

- Spinach Artichoke Dip:  an excellent starter, served hot from the oven, with just enough bubbly cheese on top.

- Pear & Blue Salad:  great, fresh, tasty, and big enough to be an entree.

- Burger:  just okay, nothing special.  Served hot, cooked as requested.

- Mac & Cheese:  AMAZING!  We added bacon, and it is top shelf.  It's super rich and filling, so be careful.  This is a must-try dish here.

- Service was extremely friendly and easy going.  But the kitchen is still slow..."}
{"text":"This place is a sports bar so there's not really much to report on here.  The wings are excellent and so are the tacos. The quality of service here changes like the seasons. Some days it's hot and some days it's cold."}
{"text":"Hard to rate this place.   Food was good, menu was legit, service was a disaster.  How do you not know that you're going to be busy after a Steelers home game?  How come your hostess is walking around either DRUNK off her ass or stoned?  It appeared that there was only one waitress working.   ATTN OWNER-the season just started-clean house quick!"}
{"text":"good atmosphere pre game.  seemed solid to me. good burger, fries and beer.  wasnt overly crowded so maybe a lot of the complaints about service were not seen by me."}
{"text":"The manager at BZ, Brandon, contacted me after my previous review.  I almost always access my account by phone so I didn't get around to writing back.  Today, he surprised myself and my coworker by delivering tons of food for us to try.  I was still skeptical - since everyone from my office who has eaten there has not been pleased - but I decided free food won't kill me.  

He delivered spicy chicken salads, lamb salads (the dish we had last time), bruschetta, and hummus with pita.  So far, everyone loves it!  I have to say the salads are brimming with crisp lettuce, tender meat, and tasty veggies.  The bruschetta was pretty decent - likely better eaten fresh in the restaurant.  The hummus is so-so, but came with soft pita wedges and a trio of toppers that were delicious.  

I have to say, the food is much improved.  Brandon seems like he truly wants to make BZ's better all around.  He reported to my coworker that they have revamped a lot of things since our last visit.  Now, we'll have to head over for Happy Hour to check out the service some night.  

Thank you, Brandon!"}
{"text":"This wasn't a bad meal, or really exceptional in any way.  It isn't like I wish I hadn't eaten there. It is like someone took a chile's and changed the color scheme.

I ordered an entree that had almost no flavor. There were plenty of textures, but I couldn't identify one single spice, meat, or taste in it.  I imagine it is how soylent green tastes."}
{"text":"Went in just to watch a Pens game on a Thursday night and the place wasn't busy at all. They have  a great craft beer selection (all drafts are $3 during happy hour!) and the service is friendly and quick. Plus...I was expecting normal bar food, but upon ordering I was happily surprised by the fantastic menu selection - I wanted to try everything. I eventually chose the Turducken Burger on a recommendation from the bartender (turkey burger, duck confit, arugula, and aioli) and it was AMAZING. Highly recommended. My boyfriend had the Lo Country Mac n Cheese (with fried chicken) which was incredible as well. Another friend got the duck tacos which were also good, but maybe had too much sauce and were the least impressive of the the dishes we tried. 

Overall, great service, amazing food, and tons of great local and regional craft beers (in addition to the typical domestics). A classy, bright spot in the North Shore."}
{"text":"Just awful. I ordered a dirty martni because their logo has a martini glass on it. I figured that's what they specialize in. I asked for it to be chilled with 2 olives. Well my order must have been too complicated because they served it in a beer glass. Nice and warm. No olives. I chalked it up to maybe a miscommunication. Some how... So instead of seeing the signs and leaving I ordered some food. Do not get their lump crab Mac and cheese. They are really just serving TUNA. I do not recommend this place for food or drinks."}
{"text":"In town for a Pirates game and stopped in here. It was perfect for what we were looking for which was a light-ish lunch (if you're hungry the menu won't let you down either.) The classic mac and cheese was amazing, as were the boneless wings in the piri-piri sauce and the Brussel slaw (we split everything.) Service was incredible from the hostess to our waitress to other servers. I wish they had had more local beers, but they did have quite an extensive beer list. Kitchen was pretty quick. We would definitely come here again and recommend it!"}
{"text":"I can see how this would be an amazing place to go to before a pirates or Steelers game. Beautiful location for that. Plenty of beers on tap big area and a clean bar. I had the turducken burger and it was really unique actually was pretty stoked on it. I also had the wings with hot sauce and I was disappointed. The sauce had no kick to it and they were bland. But all in all it's not a bad place to go get some grub. If I lived here it would be one of the spots I'd hit up before a game just because of the location and the ambience"}
{"text":"I know poutin - I've been to Montreal enough times to know that pile of gravy, cheesy sinful goodness.  What they served at BZ's was not poutin (it's gotta come with cheese curds, not shredded mozzarella and the gravy tasted like it came out of a jar), but the fries were damn good. 

I ordered the turducken and swapped out the turkey burger for beef (because medium rare beef tastes better with duck confit and a runny egg).  I was nervous coming in, but lunch was quite serviceable, they had plenty of craft beers on tap, and every ESPN channel running on each TV."}
{"text":"We were visiting the PNC Park for the first time and stopped here for lunch before the game. It was crazy busy, but our server did a great job taking care of us. I had the Cobb salad and thought it was very good. My son ordered the Mexican Mac n cheese and it was just ok - it reminded us of hamburger helper which is not what we had expected. They were out of the duck (this was strange since they had just opened, so that was certainly a negative) so couldn't order the duck pizza. My soon to be daughter-in-law chose the fungi pizza instead. None of us liked the name, but we did like the pizza. My daughter had the fries and burger and thought both were good. Hubby declared the BLT was ok."}
{"text":"BZ's is very meh.  The staff was ok, but not overly excited to assist their customers.  It appeared we received a little better service than other couples near us.  I ordered a Bud Light and the waiter had to actually check they hadn't run out.  Yes, he was concerned they had run out of beer around 4pm with a night game about to start across the street.  A waitress waiting a large group next to us actually dropped a credit card on the ground and had I not picked it up and gave it to our waiter, who knows what charges that poor gentleman would have received.  I feel that a little more attentive staff could turn this place around for me.  I tried the cordon blue chicken sliders.  They were good...not great.  My wife ordered the mozzarella cheese \"sticks\"  which are actually balls filled with a water like substance when you bite into them.  They also place the balls in a funnel shaped \"bowl\" with very questionable shredded lettuce on the bottom which in return, made the \"cheese sticks\" taste like an awful salad.  I would recommend avoiding the so called cheese sticks.  We left shortly after to find another place before we went to the ball game,.  It's not that I would never go back, but with several other options in the area, why would I.  If I knew that the service would improve, I would give it another try."}
{"text":"I CANT EXPRESS THIS ENOUGH: the goat cheese crostini will change your life. So amazing. Like none other. Forreal! be on this. That's really all. 


Also, good drafts, good happy hour, fun place fore pirates. All around rad."}
{"text":"We went there after a Pirate game.  They had only one bartender and one wait staff.  Couldn't  even order food, due to the understaffing.  The management there should be fired."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Not sure how to rate them. The bedded duck pizza was a bit salty (they used feta instead of the advertised goat cheese). I liked the spinach artichoke dip, and the turducken burger was pretty good. My dessert was supposed to be a fresh fruit trifle, but it was nothing special since it was just yogurt and blueberries. The decor was nice. Service was so-so. I had a bite of darren's cheesecake, and it was really good. BZ's is just a little inconsistent."}
{"text":"After kayaking... all you want is water, food, and rest. With that kind of desperation, it's not a tough order to fill. Right down the street from the North Shore rental place, BZ's was our answer. 

We were a group of 13 on a Saturday off-rush hour afternoon, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. They let us push the tables together into one long one with the wall seats. 

[ Service ]
Pretty friendly, but struggled with the size of our group. Food took around an hour to come out for all of us. There were some switch-ups, where someone got the wrong drink (which cost $2 more, and she was charged for it) and another person got the wrong entree (but we got the wrong one for free). I also asked about a Yelp check-in deal to get a free dessert with my meal, but the server never got back to me after asking his manager. 

[ Food ]
This is where BZ's does really well! I had the turducken burger, and it was tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. There were plenty of fries that came with it, and they were also tasty and crisp. Someone next to me got a beautiful salad with blackberries, and I think everyone loved their food. 

If you're willing to wait, you'll get pretty good  food. I think the service would be suitable for two people, but 13 was definitely our unlucky number."}
{"text":"I would go with 3 1/2 stars for this one! The location is great, right near PNC park! I love that they have live music, the night I was there was a two man group doing acoustic with a wide range and they took requests! Outdoor seating and TV's to watch games. Service is friendly and helpful. They make a good martini, complete with blue cheese stuffed olives and I would recommend the Duck Confit sliders with cranberry--yummy. The bread is not so hot, store bought but I ate mostly the duck which was yummy. My friend got a salad which was good. Great spot for before or after game!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to grab lunch while wandering around by the ballpark and the open terrace on a beautiful day called us to BZ.

Their draft and bottle lists both looked great. We started with truffle fries, which were crispy and delicious. My Atlas Salad with portabella mushroom was pretty good, although the Greek salad dressing was more oily than I would have liked. 

Our server was super kind and was very attentive. If you're down by PNC Park, I would definitely check out BZ again."}
{"text":"This establishment was recommended by the staff at the hotel where I was lodging. The place was very nicely appointed with a excellent selection of beers. I sat at the bar, ordered a beer and some food; specifically the Duck Sliders. The sliders were fair. The confit was just right in one bite but dry in another. Perhaps due to being cooked ahead of time and not reheated properly. I wouldn't necessarily take exception with a fair meal, but when the service falls short it adds insult to injury. Folks need to realize the two most important words in any customer facing business; Thank You. No matter how busy you may be, it takes no time at all to say thank you to you patrons when they pay their check. Those two words can cover a multitude of sins."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch with my husband and our friend and after being there for an hour, I have left without eating. Our friend and I both ordered portobello dishes, but they were completely out of portobellos--which we weren't told about until after we had ordered. Common mistake.. No problem, so we ordered new dishes. 

I then ordered a breakfast pizza (brunch menu was available) without bacon because I am a vegetarian. My husband and our friend received their food and I was told mine would be out soon. They had both nearly finished their food by the time my breakfast pizza arrived...and it had bacon.  Lots of bacon that I couldn't even pick off if I tried. 

Didn't bother to order new food. Service was super slow and low quality. Very disappointed because I recently moved to Pittsburgh and am scouting out places I could enjoy in the future. Probably won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"Good food and good value as well. Go on Tuesday for $5 sandwiches and discounted beer."}
{"text":"I have worked on the North Shore for 3+ years now and am thrilled that BZs came onto the scene.  I'm now a Monday regular for their $6 burgers/BLTs -- the Memphis Melt is a GREAT burger -- and I also love their individual-sized pizzas.  Happy hour is also awesome at BZ as they feature $3 drafts and have a very nice selection of draft beer.  Service?  Not sure what a few of the others were talking about with bad service -- but I eat here at least once (usually twice) per week and usually stop by for Happy Hour at least once per week -- and I've never had a bad experience.  Brittany is an awesome server -- order is always perfect -- and she's such a sweetheart!!  Amanda is also awesome behind the bar and always provides a positive atmosphere.  I couldn't be any happier that BZ joined the lunch scene -- they've certainly won me over!!"}
{"text":"As a waiter I realize that I am particularly sensitive to service related issues.  So after letting things settle and realizing maybe they were having an off day.  I am over it.  It's a week later and I'm choosing to write this review.  I hope it helps somebody.  

I'll start by saying just because BZ looks empty don't expect quick service.  If you're lucky enough to get tyquie as your waiter be lucky to get a smile.  It's as if you're inconveniencing him by eating at his restaraunt.  Spoiler alert I still tipped 20 percent by the way.

We arrived with 6 at 6:30 hoping to beat the rush enjoy some drinks and eat all while watching the Steeler Bengals game.  Mission accomplished.  Well...beating the rush part.  Tyquie was the host and asked how many we said 6 he walked us to a table and set the menus down and walked away.  We thought wow what's up his butt.  5 minutes later he returned for drinks still no smile but not terribly unpleasant this time.  We ordered drinks and they came back within reason.  This was the lone defensible thing he did the whole time.  When he returned and we told him we'd be drinking and order food a bit later it's as if we became ghosts to him.  I can't imagine a bar on the north shore this is an uncommon request and it's not as if we planned on splitting one dinner and having a Miller lite each we were there to party.  Fully expecting to spend 100 plus on a tab and leave a more than appropriate tip for taking up the table that long.  We never got the chance.

As the bar got busier we essentially began waiting on ourselves and anytime we had to seek someone out to help it was as if we were the problem.  2 servers for that size building is appalling and wrong for any night.  Let alone Steeler game night.  They've been there long enough to know better.  But slow service I can deal with.  Rude, non existent service I can not.  This post is already to long but I will NEVER be back to BZ.  And that's saying something considering they're chicken and waffles is amazing.  Food isn't the issue there.  Your staff is.  Wel more specifically tyquie.  Because the manager tho seemingly incompetent schedule wise was pleasant as was the lone bartender we interacted with."}
{"text":"Service was great. Adrian was our server suggested several of his favorites, he had a such a nice personality. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip & pulled pork sandwich. Very good. Stopped back after Steeler Game & had the hummus also very good. Service & food top notch. Highly recommend! Adrian thanks for being such a great waiter!!"}
{"text":"I would give the waitress a break being that it was a Pirates game and the area was crowed. But either the restaurant was understaffed which I truly believe was the issue, or the she was new. The section we sat in wasn't full but with two tables, including our own. The menu was interesting, they had a lot of new dishes I've never seen before, mixed with some favorites. I really can't be a critic with the menu as I am not use to the type of items they were serving. I only ordered appetizers, but my tacos weren't bad, and the fries were really good."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place because it is convenient to my work. I had heard mixed reviews but I always like to form my own opinions. Let me say I will definitely be going back. I'm so used to places where the food looks like it came right out of a bag or deep fryer. Not this place. My food was fresh with a 'just picked from the garden' feel. My server, Michael, was awesome with just the right amount of attentiveness. He suggested some great craft beers to compliment my meal. I would have drank more but it would have required a taxi. I will definitely be returning and saving room for what looks like awesome dessert!"}
{"text":"Lots to love, here. Really amazing happy hour (extended on Wednesday and Friday!). Nice selection of beer and wine make it perfect for pre-Pirates games, and sitting outside will get you a view of all the action. Inside, the bar is spacious and there are plenty of flat-screens - definitely a sports bar! The menu has generously portioned apps plus some vegetarian friendly fare on top of normal pub grub. Also, great bloody mary bar on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Yelp says they're open until 2am on Wednesday mornings but just tried to go there and it was closed before 1am. Been there before and it was a blast. Disappointed about the early closing the night before the NL Wild Card game. Employees were all sitting around the bar like it was open."}

$3 drafts

After 3.

Honestly, I didn't know that was a thing when my boyfriend and me decided to randomly visit on a Friday afternoon. The place was dead when we walked in, which always makes me hesitant. Not this day. Which I had started with a lunch at Meat & Potatoes.

The bartender was extremely friendly and, what do you know, he's a friend of Blake's, our favorite bartender at M&P (small world). Since we had just eaten, we didn't order anything off the menu so my review doesn't include that. I can't wait to go back and try some of their items, though.

The design/layout was not at all about what I was expecting. It's nice and I love the blue and black colors. I didn't interact with the hostess or waiters/waitresses at all, but they all seemed friendly. Their draft selection was also much better than what I was expecting. What can I say? I don't think the North Shore's selection of bars and restaurants is anything to write home about, but BZ's could definitely change that, especially if the food is spot on.

I enjoyed myself for the couple of hours we were there. Because we were the only patrons for at least an hour, hour and half we got to pick the music! Stone Temple Pilots station on Pandora. It's the little things, people."}
{"text":"It's a nice place specially on game days and during summer since you can sit outside. The food is just normal pub food, very normal quality but it's a nice place to drink."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight. No one at the door,  sat ourselves. No one came to wait on us; fine we will sit at the bar. Sat for literally 15 minutes after female bartender gave us a menu and waited on a christmas party and did not come back. Got up and went across the street to Mullens where the waitress not only immediately got us drinks but FOOD ALSO!  We ere just a couple of girls looking for a bite to eat;  never again will we go to this place."}
{"text":"Arrived in the city late on a Sunday and I was starving. The staff was amazing and super helpful. The place was super clean and I look for that. 

I had the hummus for an appetizer and it was awesome. I had the cucumbers and that was a good choice. 

The chicken Marsla was delicious. Not sure why this place isn't rated any higher. 

Good work, BZ's."}
{"text":"BZ's Bar and Grill bills itself as having \"The Best Happy Hour In The 'Burgh\" or something along those lines. That I couldn't care less about as I barhop for grub not booze, and it's the former BZ's mostly excels at, offering more innovative and modern takes on tavern eats. Prior to the touring Slayer/Gojira spectacle at Stage AE recently, I had a reason to give BZ's a sporting chance and received a healthy return on my wager.

BZ's menu had been tickling my palate for some time after having examined their New American bill of fare online months ago. Due to my research, I already knew what I wanted to fill my stomach for the concert ahead well before we occupied a seat in the restaurant's cool, sleek black and blue interiors. 

Well, it was Kay who wanted the Spinach Artichoke Dip to launch our meal. A chain restaurant staple, I wasn't too enthused over the prospect, but I was won over by its hedonistic blend of cream cheese, Parmesan, and Asiago. Chunky, mossy, and highly appetizing, cuts of a buttery Crostini were provided as a vessel to carry the blobs of tempting, thermal ooze towards our mouths.

Due to Kay's decision, I had the Beef Sliders as my main and shared a Bedded Duck Pizza with the lady. 

The trio of sliders utilized thick pieces of a smoky and fiercely flavorful brisket that was too fall-apart tender to be lawful. Topped with caramelized onions, my substitution of cheddar in lieu of bleu (eew), and placed inside toasty White Castle-worthy buns, this was a perfectly indulgent treat in triplicate. 

The 6 cut pizza's lone problem was that it was a bit salty, most likely due to the curious inclusion of feta instead of the advertised goat cheese, which I would have preferred (we were not told of this switch by our server). Aside from that, the duck confit was fabulously fatty, a drizzling of olive oil making it all the richer. Garlic upped the flavor quotient a bit, almost drowning out the brackish feta, and a pile of argula cleansed the palate with every single slice. The pita bread crust was a welcome and exotic stroke of culinary cunning. 

A quoin of S'Mores Cheesecake was the dessert I singled out and singlehandedly amused my sweet tooth with. Garnished with roasted marshmallows, cordoned by lines of caramel and chocolate sauce, riddled with fragments of candy, and anchored by a graham cracker crust, this was a campfire treat one can enjoy without having to endure the Great (overrated) Outdoors or sticky, burnt fingers and mouths for that matter. 

Kay's Dessert Du Jour turned out to be a \"Fresh Fruit Trifle\" as BZ's called it. It might have been a nice, tidy, wholesome breakfast dish with some honey, nuts and perhaps lemon added to liven it up a bit, but as it was served to her, the \"trifle\" was merely a glass of yogurt with blueberries in it. Booooring. Heck, I thought trifle was supposed to have some sponge cake in it. Kay abandoned it, and I cleaned up the remainder for her. 

Overall, our dinner was no pooch, however, and I feel that BZ's is an eatery local diners would do well to keep an eye on. While many are tiring of the New American movement, BZ's offers enough novel ideas to keep this culinary genre interesting for the time being. So enjoy what they do for what it is. I know I pretty much did.

P.S. The service was acceptable. 

P.P.S. I don't know if this is worth noting, but our appetizer was half-off that evening (we ate there on a Wednesday during 'happy hour')."}
{"text":"From being in the service industry for 10 years, you pick up on certain qualities when you go out to eat or get drinks and yesterday was a front row seat on how a restaurant should NEVER be managed.  I also never complain about anything from having this experience, but I couldn't help myself.

We were trying to find a place to grab a quick bite to eat before the concert, but the North Shore was very busy because of the soccer game, beautiful weather and Counting Crows concert at Stage AE.  Therefore, we ended up walking down to the PNC Park side to get away from the crowds.  We decided to go here and try it out because there was only about 10-12 other people in the whole place.  First, it took about 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar.... I referred to the draft list provided and ordered a Blueberry Blue Point.  When this was not on tap anymore, I was told that there was another blueberry beer in its place.  I said that I would have that, but much to my surprise it was a dark, stout like beer.  The complete opposite of what a Blue Point would have been.  The bartender disappeared 3-4 times.  Although, this was not her fault.  She was the only bartender working, while there were 4-5 waitresses/waiters working as well.  There were multiple tables not cleaned off during the whole hour and a half we spent there.  We watched 6 or 7 groups of people walk out of the restaurant because no on was greeting them at the door to seat them.  I finally said something to the bartender that they were losing customers and she was then again prompted to run the whole show by herself and tell people walking in that they could sit anywhere.  Which after they sat anywhere, they were never greeted by one of the 4-5 servers not doing anything and walked out anyway.  At one point, a customer fell down the hidden step going down to bar and the waitress just laughed.  Never went over to see if he was ok or offer anything to them.  Our quick bite to eat turned into a wait for our food of almost 45 minutes when the ticket time should have been around 12 minutes max.  I realized the bartender kept leaving because she had to run and get her own food for the bar, clean tables, change channels on the tv and deal with customers complaining about their service.  If I was that bartender I would have been having a word with my manager and wait staff at the end of the night!  We will definitely not be going back to that restaurant ever again.  There was only a handful of people in the whole place and it was horrible service.  I can only imagine what it would be like when it is packed for a Pirates Game........"}
{"text":"You know, some things just shouldn't be so hard.  I came in for a late lunch and there weren't many people around.  It took a few minutes for someone to greet me.  Friendly enough.

I ordered a salad.  A loooong time later the waitress came back to tell me it should be up really soon and apologized for the delay.  Even more time passed and it finally came out.

It was good, okay, but the service seems to be an issue based on the other comments.  There are A LOT places to get sandwiches and burgers on the North Shore."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a recent Sunday afternoon.  It was surprisingly quiet here.  Turns out that they opened very recently.  This will all change when baseball season starts.  They have a prime location right across the street from PNC.  We were greeted by the bartender who helped us pick a table.  Our server Krystal is the sweetest person ever.  She was very helpful with recommendations and advice and we appreciated that.

For my drink, I took a queue from Tim W.'s review and got the Thai Coconut Tea.  The drink was so so good, I had two.  Very refreshing.  BJ got his usual beer after trying a sample at the bar.

We started with the Goat Cheese Crostini with forest mushroom, honey and parsley.  Who doesn't want an appetizer with honey?  So good.  BJ got a Shrimp Po'Boy.  It was served with yummy fries and were delicious.  I got a Buffalo Chicken Salad.  It was not at all what I was expecting.   The chicken wasn't your usual deep fried battered variety swimming in red hot.  If I had read the menu more closely, I would have been inquiring as to what piri-piri chicken is.  It's basically chicken marinated in a hot chile pepper marinade, then grilled.  It was really a nice surprise.  And I loved the combination of arugula and romaine lettuces and thinly sliced fresh radishes.  I was very impressed with my salad.  

Their dessert choices were limited, but the choices sounded great!  They offer a chocolate lava cake and s'mores cheesecake which I was really wanting to try.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert.  We really liked BZ's and plan to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Horrible. I signed up for yelp just to give this review. I waited almost an hour for a simple burger. The burger was not good at all. I also tried my boyfriends, and it was far from good. The fries weren't even good...hard to mess up fries. Waste of money.!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly servers, but plan a bunch of time to go here. S-L-O-W. And they got 2 of our 4 orders wrong. Amazing food and good prices, but... C\"mon guys."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend to catch a couple of Phillies Pirates games and stopped in with the wife for lunch. Lots of places nearby but glad we came here. Great beer specials on game days ($12 for a bucket), free desert with Yelp check-in and very reasonably priced entrees. Wife had the border town BLT and raved about the bacon. Apparently they smoke it on-site. I had the Big Tex sandwich and it was amazing! Smokey brisket (also done in-house, of course), pickled red onions, cheddar cheese and spicy mustard on a soft chewy roll. Wow. Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Both our meals came with shoestring fries that were golden and crispy with just the right amount of salt and pepper. For our (FREE) desert we had the s'mores cheesecake and it was super awesome. Chocolate chip cheesecake covered with toasted marshmallows and chocolate sauce. So good.

Manager checked in on us and made sure everything was good, which it was. Service was quick and friendly, too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped in here on Saturday for lunch. There was a game later that day, and the Pirates fans and tailgaters were already starting to descend upon the North Shore. I'm sure this place gets packed closer to game time!

We were primarily in search of a Bloody Mary, which BZ's fortunately offered. It wasn't the best Bloody I've ever had, but it wasn't bad. It definitely could have used more spice--pepper or horseradish or really anything to give it some kick. We remedied this issue ourselves with a ton of black pepper.

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I expected the typical fried chicken breast, coated in buffalo sauce--instead, BZ's serves a grilled chicken breast with a thicker sauce slathered on top. The sauce did not taste like traditional wing sauce, but reminded me more of a spicy barbeque sauce. It wasn't bad, but as a die hard lover of wings and all things coated in buffalo sauce, this wasn't quite what I expected and I thought for a moment they had given me the wrong sandwich.

The fries were great, though! I love a good crispy french fry and these did not disappoint. 

Not a bad spot to grab a bite before a game or if you're just in the area and hungry--the location is prime (literally across the street from the stadium). I just wasn't blown away by the food."}
{"text":"The fries, what can I say, they were SO GOOD. I'd like to say I'm a fry expert and they were spiced and crisp. The pulled pork sandwich was just as good. Definitely a good go-to for beer and food prior to the games."}
{"text":"Poor North Shore. I want so badly for it to be awesome... including this place. But I left feeling just okay about it. Actually totally loved the Turkey burger I ordered. After I fixed what I had noted to the server to leave off...

Wanted to make it even better with some extra BBQ sauce, but after asking, and waiting... and waiting some more, it finally came! I also waited a while for refills. Just not the best service.

The side salad was pretty boring. Iceberg lettuce with unripe tomatoes and a few pieces of onion. I'd opt to just not serve tomatoes this time of year and replace it with something else, but I'm being nitpicky. 

We also ordered the s'mores cheesecake, as it was free from the Yelp check-in! I was super pumped, as I love both s'mores and cheesecake. The marshmallows on top were toasted perfection, and while the cake was good, it seemed like it was missing something. Not rich and cheesy enough, maybe? Crust was awesome though! 

Much hipper inside than I imagined from the name. I definitely wouldn't be opposed to stopping in here before a game."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to check this place out last Friday, and enjoyed it while I was there. The service and food were both pretty good, and I really enjoyed the venue and the crowd. However, both my friend and I both ordered the pulled pork sliders and we both got sick later that night. That is enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"We popped in for a late lunch and had some big tastes out of their small plates! Good beer selection too made for a refreshing time on their small patio area. Just down the block from the Andy Warhol Museum, it was a fun way to fill our bellies. It's across the street from PNC Ballpark, and with a Pirates game later in the day, the energy in the area was high. Hope you get one of their three outdoor tables for the best people watching!"}
