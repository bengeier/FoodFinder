{"text":"Visited on a Saturday, before noon.  Already a few tables of people and one guy walking out with take-out.  Folks kept coming in as we ate.  It's kind of a charming place, because it's a stand-alone building all on its own.

All we ordered was the Pho, and both bowls were excellent.  The brisket and beef meatballs tasted great, and also the rare beef, sliced thin - both were delicious.  No funky strangeness associated with over-use of tenderizers etc.  The soup had depth, very enjoyable (real broth and not just salt / msg) and importantly, served at the perfect temperature that's nice and hot but didn't burn.  Noodles were just the right texture (not bloated or over-boiled.)  Nice helping of scallions / onions placed right on to top it off.

Nice quiet restaurant, friendly and helpful staff.  Great pho.  Looking forward to our next meal there!"}
{"text":"The pho is amazing.  decent for price hen ordering Large it seems. The fried eggy thing [had sherred pork,crab meat and other thing,] was also amazing. Some of the other things the items on the menu are overpriced for the small quanlity or portion. Presentation of the food was amazing n lovely. Will go again but will not order their spring rolls."}
{"text":"I have been to most of the best PHO's in the city and if you ask me if their PHO is the best of the best, well no but then why do I go there. THE SERVICE ROCKS! . The gentleman who does most of the waiting is very attentive and does not have a chip on his shoulder as the case is with 99.9% of the Vietnamese restaurants. You get the \"eat our CRAP and get lost\" attitude in most places BUT NOT HERE. I always take the P19 hot and sour seafood soup which I recommend to all."}
{"text":"I hate to leave such a bad review but this place made me VERY SICK.

My husband and I decided to try this new place out. He ordered  a rice dish and peach shake. I ordered a bowl of pho and a jackfruit shake. I couldn't finish my pho so my husband finished it for me. Within 10 mins of leaving the restaurant I had really bad cramps that would come and go. 

I don't want to go into detail but I had FOOD POISONING that lasted 10 days!!! I'm assuming it was the jackfruit shake since my husband didn't get sick. 

I will never come back. They definitely do not handle their food or store it properly. Please beware!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It's alright, food is okay, not worth the price. Yes the place is clean but I rather pay my money towards the good food. Service is good, about 10-15min wait for your dish is not bad bad but could be better. I always order pho in large and its still not enough for me. Large pho just means more noodles not more meat and soup."}
{"text":"This place has been my go-to pho place for the past 3 years. Amazing food and customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to try this place today for the first time.  There were a few tables with diners, we were greeted by a friendly server with a smile.  Asked for take out and he gave us menus and offered us a table to sit at while we decided.  Then he brought tea to the table as a free courtesy. So far very warming. We ordered the special beef pho and it was delicious ! Tasty broth, ample serving of noodles, meat, sprouts... Fresh lime, mint and sauce . ... All fresh and proper temperature on the rare beef. Will definitely go back. A great first impression. P.S. They have drapes for the sun. Lol"}
{"text":"The staff welcomed us when we arrived.  The order: Chicken Rice Noodle Pho along with Goat Curry, Chicken Pad Thai and Shrimp Fried Rice.  The dishes are good and are not extraordinary.  After ordering I noticed there are photos of menu items posted on the walls which is a good reference."}
{"text":"First and unfortunately will never be back. The service is very good and fast.  Our food was not good. Vermicelli bowl with pork, hardly any meat at all and my noodles were still under cooked just as the rice in my pork cold rolls. I could not eat them . The beef pho was okay, not very flavorful. Too many other great placed to go than here. Sorry but, no."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a few times and decided to just give it a try, since its hard to find a good bowl of pho in the east end of the city.  It's not very attractive from the outside, the decor in the inside was ok, but clean so I was happy. 

My hubby ordered the pho tai gan and for myself a pho ga.  We both really enjoyed it.  I see in most of the reviews that people found the broth to be plain, but I thought it was the perfect amount of flavour.  We also had the durian shake it was stinky and yummy!  They don't cheap on the amount of durian!  What I enjoyed most was the spring rolls.  Loved how they put chicken in it, thats not the norm, but very yummy!

This is definitely our new pho spot in the east end.  Great service!  I hope it sticks around, cause I can see how it can be easily missed.  They definitely need to step up the exterior of their store."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely crap. First off the location is not in a convenient place. It is directly off a busy turn making it hard to get to. The parking lot is very small and accident prone. The handicap spots are in random spots with no logic whatsoever. Typically they are located in particular spots to help make it convenient for them and given more space. 

Once you arrive you'll see it is an old take out burger joint with the take out drive through lane still marked. When you go in, it's rather modern but the layout is very odd. I was seated right between a pole and a wall, being blocked. 

I ordered pho, as usual, but found the soup VERY bland. The soup was too clear to be true but still loaded in MSG enough to make me desperate for water. There was limited meat and the Dac Biet did not have much variety of meat in it. Good thing is the large is pretty large but the small is super small.

The owners or staff thought it would be fun to raise the volume mid way through our meal. I mean Boyz II Men is great but I don't need you to blare out Motown Philly, especially when there are customers trying to eat.

I entered in with 5 people and when I left there were 0.

I do NOT recommend going here, unless you plan on just trying it and writing a bad review, then i highly recommend it. 

1 out of 5 stars for me... only because I cannot submit 0."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's unfortunate it doesn't get more customers.. it's a hidden gem. Everyone goes to pho Vietnam down the street, & from my experience, did not enjoy it. The meat was scarce and had a lot of fat. Unlike pho Vietnam, this place is really good with great friendly service, good food, larger than normal soups, & the best mango shakes! Well done pho nam dinh!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place, i came while it is past 1pm on a sunday and they only had one server, she was nice and helpful. The food was not coming that fast from the kitchen (waited almost 15mins for the appetizer). I belive the price per serving was high, 5.50 for two pieces of spring rolls, nothing special, not crispy, too oily and looks like it was reheated. The P1 i ordered was medium but kinda small in size (others have bigger servings for medium) broth was good but i think price of pho was a bit high"}
{"text":"My sister mentioned that she wanted to go for Pho on a Wednesday afternoon in this area so based on Yelp Reviews we ended up here. And I am so glad we did. 

They have many different kinds of Pho as well as other options if that's not what you're looking for. They were not too busy and service was fast and polite. We were given complimentary green tea upon seating ourselves. We took awhile to browse the menu since it was our first time and when we had decided we wrote our orders on the sheet provided.

I settled on P3 which was the Pho with Rare Beef and Beef Meatballs, my mom ordered something with less meat, and my sister ordered the Rare Beef with Tripe. We all got mediums and that was definitely enough. I love that they bring a plate with bean sprouts and basil so that you can add however much you want to your bowls. And of course you have your hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, and chili sauce at the table. 

I opted to add all the sauces to my bowl instead of dipping which worked great for me until the end. My bowl was very spicy just the way I like it, but at the end the broth was undrinkable because it was essentially liquid extra hot sauce. This was fine by me though because I was still full after finishing the meat and noodles. Maybe I will try the other technique the next time I dine here."}
{"text":"the worst pho ive ever been to. This place is so gross, its just a matter of time before they shut down. i would give it zero stars if i could. My mom and I both couldnt finish the food here, she said they only use \"white meat because white people dont know how to eat anything else\""}
{"text":"Christmas day they were open! We had a pho and spring rolls. Everything has awesome and tasted very fresh!

Will be making this our go to pho place!"}
{"text":"I really did not enjoy my meal here. But don't want to leave an entirely negative review because it wasn't horrible.

I did not find the food authentic. I had the house special Pho and the broth was off. It seriously lacked flavour. My husband had the vermicelli and as always he loved his meal, he's less particular than I am.

One nice touch was that my smoothie was brought promptly before my food. What is it about Vietnamese restaurants and bringing out drinks when your meal is almost finished? I was pleasantly surprised that I could sip on a delicious jackfruit smoothie during my meal.

I might give them another try if I am in the neighbourhood, but I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Pho. This is one of our favourite place in Scarborough. This will be our regular place for Pho now."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for take out. One of the best pho and broth in the area. Great service once you walk through the doors. 

Got the large beef special and a mango milkshake. No complaints about the food at all so far.

Only negative thing about this place is the area its in, if you're going south on kennedy be careful of the left turn. It can get quite dangerous and tricky. 

Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"There are bare pho places along Kennedy Road (almost every intersection) and this was the last pho restaurant on my list to try along this road. This is not a bad place and I think it's a little cheaper than the ones I usually go to. We came around 8 pm on a Thursday, and it wasn't too busy. The server was super friendly and we were seated right away.

When it comes to trying new pho restaurants I always always have to try their fresh rolls and a house special pho. I didn't see that they had a house special, so I got one that would be similar to one. The broth was a little too salty, but it was still tasty. I also ordered fresh rolls with shrimp and pork. Their peanut sauce is too watery for my liking, but the rolls were good. 

I will definitely come back if I want to grab something to eat after the gym ahaha."}
{"text":"Tried this place out recently because it's conveniently located near work and gym. I'll probably come by again, but I won't go out of my way to come here. It's a nice place, nicely decorated. It was empty when we went in, but that was probably due to the snow outside. I ordered the sate broth with beef flank and an avocado milkshake. The avocados used in the shake weren't ripe enough. The sate broth was nice, but not spicy enough for me. There were large slices of beef flank, but I feel that there weren't enough pieces of meat to the amount of soup and noodles. The food was good, it just wasn't spectacular or anyway standout from the numerous other Pho places along Kennedy."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service. A little weird getting into the plaza if your going south on Kennedy (drive into oncoming traffic). They serve pho with the thick variety of rice noodle. Very nice presentation and taste. A little light on the protein though or else I would have given four stars instead."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant due to it's convenient location. I found service was a bit slow but good nonetheless, I ordered the vermacelli. I found the noodles a bit too soggy/mushy and the portion of chicken+viet sausage was a bit sparse...the chicken was in tiny bits and I like when it is actual chunks. I'm not a big fan of the super tiny vermacelli noodles. My friend ordered the sate noodle soup and it tasted pretty good. Not quite spicy more heat. Overall, I'd come here again just for the convenience and try their pho next time. Prices seem a bit higher, but good in the fact that they have SMALL sizes. Most places don't even offer small, which is refreshing to know this place does."}
{"text":"I came in after a dinner at Makkal Chon with friends. Basically just mooched off my parents' food. 

I love that this place is quiet. It sounds bad, but I like good food in quiet environments. It's really peaceful. I had a bite of fried rice that was tasty, but salty. There were a generous amount of veggies and the salt was coming from some sort of preserved sausage. I also had a piece of fried spring roll, which was still crispy after my parents had almost finished their food, and the vermicelli was thinner than I'm accustomed to, which I love. It makes for a nice bouncy texture and it soaks up the fish sauce so incredibly well.

Cool thing about this place is their decor. There are a lot of white tubes in windows, etc. They also have a plate with a big white bone and a number of different spices sitting on their service counter. They're bones! As in beef bones for making pho soup! Aaaaahhhhh (in the best possible way)! I love it!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with pho for comfort food and especially on a cold day. I've been here a few times and always enjoyed their food here. It's one of my favorite pho places to go to in Scarborough. The pho here is pretty good and they give you generous portions. I think the flavour is spot on with the soup broth. Prices here are fairly cheap for the portions they give you. They definitely don't skimp on the meat nor the noodles. I ordered the 101 special which basically has everything in it, along with the spring rolls and the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. The Vietnamese coffee is so good and a must to complement your meal!! The coffee is fresh and they give it you while it's brewing fresh hot coffee and you pour it after in ice. They only accept debit and cash here. Overall, a highly recommended pho place to get some cheap delicious noodles and spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I know that there are many Pho places in the city to chose from arguably there are better places to chose from, however, I have decided to give this place the highest rating possible for there incredible customer service. 

They say that you come to a restaurant for the food but you come back for the service! I find this saying to be especially true here. While the food and many portion are great! It's the exceptional service and attention to the details that has made me come back. I often stop by here on my way home from work and more often I just do the take out. The server always brews a pit of tea just for me while I wait. This small token always goes a long way with me. 

The food here is of course great! The fried egg on top option is so good! The soups are very good, and they will make a personal white rice put on the side of you like. The pork is always my go to meat as its done well. 

I will be back many more times, and it goes with out saying; I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I showed up here on a Friday night and the place was empty so at first we were a little hesitant. The interior is decorated very nicely. Also there are photos of the dishes everywhere which it's always nice to have a visual 

We ordered a large rare beef and tendon soup with fried shrimp rolls as an appetizer. First off, the shrimp had this curry style flavour to the coating that just added that extra burst of flavour. Definitely the best ones we've tried. 

The soup came with plenty meat and tendon. The broth was exceptionally flavourful. The rice noodles were wider and flatter than most of the pho places we had been to which gave a unique texture. 

When we went to pay at the counter there is a plate with all of the different ingredients that go into making the broth. 

Overall we will definitely be going back again and we will try different things from the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite place for pho. So clean and the guy there is always nice. I eat pho or vermicelli most of the times and they are absolutely amazing. What i like the most about this place is the cleanless of the store and the food. 

Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks like it is in the middle of renovations but the food is good. The broth was good but I didn't like the noodles they used in the pho. I like my noodles more firm, it tasted like they used the fresh noodles."}
{"text":"I would never come back ... I came here today just one hour ago to buy my dinner for me and bf .we had c1 combination rice .chicken , pork , steam egg and shrimp warp what they call. And we bought side order of spring rolls. For my bf combination rice he only have 3piece of pork meat and 3 pieces of chicken in a very tiny pieces that we can calculate  and with those. Item. Mine  is better but the meat are so tiny and small pieces..this is the most RIPOFF vietnamese food i ever had. We feel cheated. But their food taste good . will not be back . The dinner cost $30 .. Is expensive"}
{"text":"This review is a bit late but this place is a solid Viet resto in the scarb area. Service was really slow though on my visit but I attribute that to it being a busy day. You can see the bones all over the resto as decoration and its also used in their pho! 3.5-4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was pretty good. Always good to see some Vietnamese food around Scarborough. Price was average and environment was clean - minus the dish washing soap in the washroom. Pictures would be nice too on the menu for first timers."}
{"text":"Recently visited PND out of curiosity and ordered fresh shrimp rolls, large brisket and rare beef pho and bun bo hue.  

After reading countless reviews about the difficulty in accessing this restaurant, we arrived and parked safely in a rather odd looking space .  At first sight, it seems like the building was undergoing renovation as there are tiles missing on the exterior and large patches of white paints covering both interior and exterior of the building.  

Unlike other reviewers, we did not experience the \"blindingly bright dining room\" even though it was a plenty sunny afternoon.  The server greeted us promptly and was very pleasant.  

Our food arrived shortly after ordering.  The fresh shrimp rolls were light and tasty, filled with plenty of shredded iceberg which made the rolls much lighter than other noodle-heavy rolls.  The broth for the large pho was average, not too beefy and not overburdened with msg.  

The bun bo hue was just ok as well.  It came with a very tender pork hock, couple of good blood jellos, some sliced shank meat and Vietnamese bologne.  The round noodles were nicely chewy and not overcooked.  One thing I didn't enjoy about this soup was the overly pungent undertone of the soup.  Even after squeezing the heck out of my lime slice and dropping the whole thing in my soup, the pungent broth was simply too over-powering.  

The overall experience here was so ho hum that I'm not sure if I would go out of my way for a second visit, especially with Pho Vietnam just down the street from there."}
{"text":"Just came here to get takeout with my coworkers. Food was prepared very fast and it was so delicious! 


Pros: 
- Parking: tons of parking, do not worry about not being able to find a spot 
- Location: located right by an intersection, making it easy to get to by car or public transportation 
- Food: food is prepared fresh and quick! 

Pho: I love the Pho Ga (chicken) and the Pho Dac Biet (assorted meats). Broth is tasty and noodles are fresh. Also tried the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Vermicelli with Grilled Pork & Spring Rolls) which tasted good! Personally I prefer romaine lettuce over iceberg but the taste of the dish was still great. 


They take cash, debit and credit card! My coworkers and I will be ordering more from here for lunch. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Sucks!
Expensive.
Questionable expiration dates of ingredients!

Chicken wings ($10) & specialty spring rolls ($10) all made with mediocre quality meats BUT sold at high quality prices.

Don't waste your $$$ here!"}
{"text":"Another Vietnamese restaurant opens up. There are just so many of them around these days. Ordered my usual pho with rare beef and tripe. No extra large option? That's sad. I guess I will have to settle for the large. The beef was not rare at all and I would even go as far to say its a bit over cooked. The soup was nothing special and the vermicelli noodles were a bit on the thick side. Good portion of tripe given. Also got a side of deep fried spring rolls for $5.50 which was done well with a nice crispy outer layer.

Service was fast and the place is very new looking and clean. I have to agree with Nguyen T. - they definately need some blinds as the sun was at full force when I was there during lunch. I guess I could work on my tan at the same time and soak up some vitamin D.

Overall a good meal for a good price"}
{"text":"My regular pho spot! Nice atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. It's also authentic Vietnamese pho too. 

Food:
I always order the P3 (s) pho with rare beef and beef ball. The beef was nice and tender and the beef balls were delicious. The noodles are the thick flat noodle (fresh noodle). They always give enough noodles and broth and the meat portion is better than most pho places. 

I also tried the Bun bo hue (spicy Vietnamese soup) which I found wasn't that spicy. It had too much shrimp paste and not enough lemongrass flavour.

I always order the iced coffee - they bring it out with the phin filter, condensed milk, and ice. It's delicious, strong, and refreshing!

Overall, the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious for the price."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho house in Toronto to date. The portioning is incredibly gracious and one never needs to worry about wanting extra sprouts. The family that runs this business is very kind and warm. Service is very fast and the environment is really comfortable to just sit down for a wholesome meal. The food of course is beyond compare. I have to say that their selection of produce and meat never fail to show freshness. The taste is amazing. I have settled down for P2 most of the time. However I find the spicy udon soup is not appetizing at all from the surprisingly large excess fat and exotic ingredients  (ie.pig feet) in there. Other wise everything else is incredibly satisfying. 
Note that whatever you take out, the portioning is smaller than what you would receive sitting down, thus be warned. (I have done many take outs and comparisions before)"}
{"text":"Currently my favourite pho restaurant. Soup tastes like that of the North according to my friend. Deep fried spring rolls tastes like home. Lots of items on the menu, prices are average. Decor and furniture is nice compared to other pho restaurants in the city. Has lots of parking."}
{"text":"Arguably the best pho in the area. The broth has some kind of sweetness to it that other chains don't have - I suspect from the abundance of green onion they add. 

Price ok

Noodles are great and don't get soggy or soft in my experience"}
{"text":"Very light tasted beef broth. Very little beef in the soup noodle in terms if what i paid for, especially the brisket is so tiny and thin cut.. i almost cant find the beef tendor in the bowl..."}
{"text":"Non-descript Viet restaurant. Came here because I was waiting for my car at the Honda Roadsport next door. Seating is comfortable and there is air conditioning. Staff are friendly too. 

I tried the sate vegetarian pho and it was good; bok choy, two pieces of fried tofu (more would have been nice) and the usual stuff. It didn't stand out to me but had a nice, light spicy kick to it. Soursop shake was solid. 

Good prices and over all decent. I'd return but not my first choice."}
{"text":"First time here.  It was Friday around 4:45pm.  Early dinner for me, Lots of parking at this time.  The server is friendly.

I ordered the Pho house special Medium.  Looked good !!  The broth is ok, not enough or any tendons, 

Overall food was ok, nothing special.

Looked like they were still under reno. 

4 Stars for service,
3 Stars for food quality

Atmosphere of this place, actually reminds me of being in a small town in Ottawa or the east coast.

I took some pictures of the food, BUT , my sd card got corrupted. Ugghh.

Overall... not bad...not great."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the area. The owners are very nice, food always fresh and made to order. Prices are also fairly reasonable for what you get. There is a good amount of parking in the back and the one time I used their washroom it was clean!  

My new favourite item to order is vermicelli noodles with spring roll and grilled pork. I find the meat extremely thin (is it me or has their meat gotten thinner lately?) so I order extra meat for three dollars. This combo with the vermicelli that comes with shredded lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers and peanuts with the Nuoc Cham (sweet fish sauce) is really good.    I tend to order this item often, and if I don't feel for noodles I'll just get it with rice. 

I've also ordered their Stir Fried egg noodle with chicken and vegetable. I did not enjoy it. I felt like it lacked in flavour. I wouldn't order it again. 

I haven't tried their Pho---but it looks good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some real authentic Vietnamese pho, this is the place to go. 

The location is a bit sketchy, but the design of the restaurant is quite modern.  The layout can be improved more, but understandable because of the size of the store.. 

I enjoy my pho bowl -- since the noodles are fresh and thin. The beef is high grade which makes the bowl so much better. The broth is amazing in my opinion. I am Vietnamese and I love the sweet taste the broth offers.  

I would highly recommend you give this place a try. They are new and have very friendly staff.  The price is a bit pricey, but the quality is good. 

I changed this rating from a 5 star to 4 star. I've recently came back and the pho isn't consistent."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Went for lunch on a weekday and go a nice hot bowl of noodle soup. Small is about $6.50 and it's got the fresh noodles I love!!! They also have fresh spring rolls which were pretty good too $5.50. service was great... Can't complain about anything!

Will be back pronto."}
{"text":"It's decent and seems clean! Came here for a late lunch today since my mechanic is around the corner! Not sure if it's late (3pm) so they ran out of noodles or what, our two small pho had like a couple strands of noodles and that was it! Never seen such a dinky stingy bowl of noodles before! Two small slices of beef and a few tiny chunks of tendons! The soup seems ok, but $6.99 for a small should be at least have more than couple strands! Wish I took a picture! The plate of sprouts was more than the noodles that's how small it was! Otherwise I'd give it a 3 star! Not sure if I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Being in the Scarborough area today, Vietnamese food always comes to mind.  The choices for Vietnamese food in Scarborough is definitely much better than Markham.  We have been here many times for dinner especially since our Vietnamese friends love this place.  They always order the beef soup noodles so it must be good here.  I always like ordering either the pork chop rice or Bún (Vermicelli).  Today I got B5 Bún Tht Nng with Tau Hu Ky - Vermicelli grilled pork with bean curd wrap shrimp.  The deep fried bean curd wrap shrimp is so good here - not a lot of Vietnamese restaurant have this.  The grilled pork was only okay today and has tasted better before and the amount of meat was very little.  Overall, it was good lunch."}
{"text":"Pho Nam Dinh is a newly opened Vietnamese Restaurant in Scarborough. 

The exterior restaurant looks a little sketchy with the no permanent restaurant signage and parking lot set up a little awkward. But interior is surprisingly nice. On a balmy sunny day without blinds, the inside can be uncomfortably hot and bright, where is my sunglasses.

The menu is standard Vietnamese with the usual Rice, Noodle and Rolls. 

Bún bò Hu ($8.50) Viethamese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was quite nicely done with the correct toppings: pork hock, pig blood, beef shank and ch la. The broth had a nice lemongrass aroma with a hint of shrimp paste which was decent. The only complaint maybe the portion size as I can ate 2 orders in order to be full.

I will probably be back to try out other items. Hopefully they would have blinds installed or I need to come back when the sun is down!"}
{"text":"Omgsh. This place is amazing. Me and my girl friend were the only ones here at first. We ordered fried shrimp rolls and 2 large bowls of pho! Delicious. And we talked for a long time. They had a good quantity of noodles and beef in mine. The noodles are rice noodles so they're flat. But that's my favourite so no problem! Enough said really. Go here! 5min walk from Ellesmere rt station."}
{"text":"My friend was sick and his nose was a runny mess so we decided to grab some comfort food. I was there for support and not the food of course.
There were a few diners when we got there and only 2 people working which might have been why it took a while to be seated. However, it wasn't too busy that upon eye contact with the waiter he immediately helped us. After that, food came out quite promptly. 
We got the beef noodle special (P1). There is nothing astounding about what we had, but it was good. Things I didn't like were that the broth was really light and didn't have much flavour. Secondly, the beef was tough and chewy so it was hard to eat. However, I was a fan of their noodles which were wide but thin.
The inside is much nicer than the outside. It was clean and the decor was better than other pho places. However, the sign outside definitely needs to be spruced up to match."}
{"text":"Always come here with friends to eat dinner. We normally just get the Pho. It is great, we love it! It is also situated conveniently very close to bus stops. Great atmosphere! We would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Homely and classic are the first words that come to mind after eating here! 

Started with the shrimp fresh rolls, pretty simple and tasty. The dipping sauce needed a little bit more flavour, had to add some sambal to it.

The medium Pho was HUGE, a large at most places. It had a deep beef bone flavour which is different than most of the heavy MSG Pho that you get out there. Tasted more like it was more natural. The wife had the broken rice dish, chicken, steamed egg and added the deep fried shrimp curd and she loved it!

Would definitely come back!"}
