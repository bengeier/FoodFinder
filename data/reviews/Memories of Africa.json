{"text":"During my Summer search for the African Bird's Eye Chili more popularly known as Peri Peri, I came across the Memories of Africa website.  It was with that search that I found there is limited supply of South African foods and basically no authentic restaurants available derived from that region.  Btw, Moroccan and Ethiopian are not of that region.

The same search of Peri Peri lead me to find South African specialties such as Boerwors(Farmer's Sausage) and Biltong(Cured Meat).  While there might be a handful within the GTA and surrounding areas, this location is the closest and most convenient for me.  This is not a large shop by any means as they do sales on their website but if you do come by, the friendly owner is there to greet you.

Inside is a lightly African themed shop that consists mostly of Can, Dry, Package Goods.  They are mostly unique as to your local Grocery Store probably will not stock the same items.  Most noticeable was a Spillers Peri Peri Oil, the Freezer of Boerwors, Fridge of Biltongs, Mrs H. S. Ball's Chutneys, and a good selection of Candies and Chocolates.

Florence Meats Peri Peri Biltong($6.50/100g) tasted like Jerky Beef except it's cut thin and against the grain with flakes of Peri Peri for flavour.  As with any Jerky Beef it can get addiction as a snack and noted by a friend it tasted like Chinese Cured Meat."}

{"text":"I have no previous memories of Africa.. now after visiting Memories of Africa, Peri Peri chili powder and Beef Biltong now will be always at the back of my mind. 

Beef Biltong supposed to be a South African delicacy with beef air dried instead of smoked to create that unique taste and texture... (and the addition seasoning of Peri Peri sure helps with the taste!) 

My friend at first was really skeptical... since the Beef Biltong in the fridge looks not too appetizing but after she start eating that, she could not stop!... Beef Biltong is something that you have to eat every single bites of it before you can stop, that is addictive! 

There are also bottles of condiments, sauces, seasonings that are all from South Africa... which is quite unique and you cannot find in a supermarket near you! 

The store is nicely maintained, the store owner is so so nice... asked me if I want a cookie... hey not going to say no... yes please!"}
