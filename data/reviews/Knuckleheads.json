{"text":"First off, love the atmosphere of this place. Gotta love a Browns backer bar. $2 bud light 16oz cans,$2.50 16oz Labatt. Also, wing and other food features/specials. The crowd is almost as rowdy, as going to the game. Definitely going back during Browns season at least."}

{"text":"I have to say I've been pleasantly impressed with this bar/restaurant. I have known about this place for years since my brother-in-law frequented it regularly but I always thought it to be a dive bar. Having worked a few late nights recently after midnight I stopped in to see if they had food. They do!! They serve late and that is terrific. The food has been fantastic and the cook actually came out twice to ask if my meal was served to my satisfaction. My last visit I took advantage of their cheeseburger special with fries for $5. They have specials everyday. My tall draft beer only $3. They have TVs everywhere a music player and video games and pool. The service is excellent. They take credit cards and cash. I think I will be stopping in more often.  So I really recommend this place!!"}
