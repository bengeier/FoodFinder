{"text":"Stopped for lunch and got a pork souvlaki pita.  Pork was cooked just right and all the ingredients were tasty abd fresh.  Friendly staff and a light, clean atmosphere.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food & service I received my food in less than 5 minutes after I ordered. And the Gyro is one of the best I had. Fries are seasoned perfect."}
{"text":"Great food, and the owner/chef is very friendly. My chicken and my husband's pork were very juicy, tender, and flavorful. Everything had that fresh, just-prepared deliciousness. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  All the greek food I've tried is d-lish, super fresh, best in town.  Also love their non-greek items.  The Asian salad is so clean & yummy, a must try if you're not in the mood for the best gyro's in town...."}
{"text":"This place is gooooood!  The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing.  The gyros are def the best in town.  Salads are freaking HUGE!  They even handed me two coupons for my next visit.  Safe to say I'll be using those soon!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Arguably the best tasting Greek food in Phoenix.  Food is simply delicious and staff friendly.  Will definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I just moved a half mile down the road from this place and NOT ONCE was I disappointed.  First off the 300 Burger is a must try.  The lamb melts in your mouth and pairs off with a well-seasoned patty that balances the rest of the savory flavors that make this appetizing meal complete.  The tzatziki is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of Mediterranean food in my time!"}
{"text":"Really good calamari, clean, friendly, Mac and cheese made on spot, lamb chops were so tender. Would def go back!"}
{"text":"This place has food so good that it should be illegal! The chicken wrap and the gyro are very delicious. The Greek Fries are also a must get! Everything is very good here and the restaurant overall is very clean and decorative of Greece's culture and heritage. I would highly recommend this place as it is a nice addition to the neighborhood! Yum."}
{"text":"Great food! Chicken Souvlaki was great!  The Italian sandwich was great!  Good size portion and fries were addictive. Kids got cheese burgers and it filled them up."}
{"text":"What a disappointment for the money hardly any meat on gyro favor of sauce and meat good and pita but not worth the money  to bad never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The srout pita was really tasty, but the avgolemono soup was not. It had a flavor of imitation lemon, the egg was floating on top like foam. It was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Came in at 5pm on a Tuesday and ordered a gyro pita, chicken pita and combo'd for a drink and fries (alot of food, but I was hungry). Everything was cooked to order and served hot in a timely manner given the aforementioned. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming and the prices were reasonable. 

The menu is pretty big and offers something for everything. The decor is pretty basic, but once you sink your teeth into something you wont care. All in all, Im glad to have a greek restaurant in my neck of the woods to sate my cravings affordably."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had in Phoenix area and I've tried gyros at about 10+ different places. You can tell the quality of the meat is way better than any of the Greek joints out here. Also, whatever seasoning they use on their fries is awesome."}
{"text":"This could be the best place for gyros in the valley! And their tzatziki is AMAZING! So is the spanikopita and the chicken. Great people behind the counter, super friendly and welcoming! Our new favorite- we go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"The food is different for this area. We really enjoyed the Greek food. The aromas are amazing and very flavorful.  It is a small and busy place for take-out or sit down. The service is good and the restaurant was clean. We will continue eating here. This will be our go to Mediterranean place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome gyro! Easily twice as much gyro meat as other places. Paid Extra for feta and they piled it on. The French fries were deep fried to golden perfection! The person at the counter was very polite and attentive. Lots of folks stopped in to pick up take out. A little hard to find but worth the search."}
{"text":"Well priced menu, clean bathrooms, clean resturant, quick service. I have tried several items and everything is great!  I love the Gyro sandwich with the salad or greek fries. The fries are awesome when you want a treat.  The salads are big. You definitely can share. The real greek salad is my recommendation along with the chicken. It's well seasoned."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! I've been meaning to try different menu items but I can't bring myself to  get anything other than the gyros here. They are just so good!  Portions are great and the prices are not bad either. The place is very clean and the staff is very welcoming and accommodating. 

This place is the real deal when it comes to good Greek food. Definitely come try it out!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 7 months now maybe 3 times per month and everything has been good. I have been eating gyros for almost 30 years now and theirs is very good. I have ordered a few other things from time to time but I keep going back to the gyro. It is loaded with meat and I get that and a drink and I am satisfied. The place seems to get a lot of take out orders but not a lot of people eating there around lunch so it is very quiet when I go. 

I personally see no reason for a bad review (I see some here) but every place has a bad hour or bad day occasionally. Plus you can't please everyone."}
{"text":"Really, really good. I just tried them while visiting town and needing a dinner after a long day of travel. I was delayed by the rental car company and arrived 5min before closing on my way to my hotel. They still served me, no problem! Warm meat (and plenty of it) and good sauce on my delicious gyro. Very filling for under $7. I also ordered hummus and veggies, with a side of pita. The hummus wasn't my fav but i would visit again for the gyro. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Nice local spot for some quick but traditional flavor. Options for the kids and always friendly staff. Worth trying and unique specials."}
{"text":"The food here is great! The grilled chicken skewers are excellent and the combo platter is my go to. Come here for great Greek food"}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant was very friendly, and the food was great and plentiful too!  We even were provided a free dessert :) (Note: That may not happen for you as well,  but, it was still thoughtful).

Definitely come here, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Having the gyro platter and the meat it tender and tasty and the green beans are the secret sauce of this meal. Really enjoying everything on the plate.  The place is small but don't pass it by. The staff have been very friendly and the service very fast. I wish I wasn't from another state otherwise I'd be here at least once or twice a week."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Chicken has the perfect amount of grill char. Generous portions and inexpensive prices. Very clean. Quick service. Friendly staff. Good \"Americanized\" Mediterranean food.

Tzatziki was just ok. Chicken minimally seasoned."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and good portions; not too much or too little. The man behind the counter was very patient and explained all the choices in great detail, and helped my kids customize their orders. He was extremely considerate when he saw we were ordering to go, and made sure we had enough of everything we could need. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty gross and greasy. I ordered the eggplant gyro and it was a disaster they just pile food and grease.  The only thing decent was the hummus but let's be honest how can you mess up hummus.  This place is good for desperate people who need cheap food. But the prices reflect that so I should have known when I ordered"}
{"text":"Two words... Grecian Delight! For those of you who are unaware, this is the brand of gyro meat sold here. It is BY FAR the most authentic and delicious gyro meat out there. In addition to this wonderful gyro, everything offered is fresh and supplied in super human portions. I have still yet to try dessert with no name, but to be honest, one would have to only eat half a meal to be able to accommodate it. Do yourself a favor if you're in Arcadia, stop in and fill your face!"}
{"text":"I had both a gyro and a horiatiki salad that were delicious. There was a lot of tzatziki on the gyro with chopped tomatoes and onions and the meat had just a little browned and crispy but not dry. I usually like feta on the gyro but forgot to order it this way but it was plenty good without so I didn't worry about it this time. The salad was good with plenty of cucumber, feta and tomatoes. Tomatoes weren't that tasty but that's pretty standard these days unfortunately. Next time I'm in the area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered all sorts of goodies and enjoyed it all: gyros, souvlakia, avgolemono soup, salad, tzatziki, and fries. The avgolemono soup is an authentic Greek dish you don't see at many Greek restaurants, so this was a pleasant treat! Liked the food so much, I had Spartans cater my last party; they made me 80 perfectly cooked chicken and pork souvlakia. Only downside is that they don't deliver in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Just opened 3 wks. Owner was friendly and helpful. Food was very tasty and affordable. Nice clean ambiance. Pork Gyro was delicious. Pita bread is soft and tasty."}
{"text":"Best Greek Food.  We had the Gyros, Greek Fries,  Greek Salad and the Greek Soup.  We also had a fried pita with honey, almonds, and yogurt which was an awesome combo.  These guys take pride in everything they make.  Super clean.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great prices for wonderful, fresh, full flavor quality Greek food. Better than our regular place that we go to back home. We'll be back! A real jewel in the midst of other eateries in the area. And they have Jalapeño mac n cheese."}
{"text":"This is my first review here on yelp, i've been really hesitant to leave reviews because i can tend to be critical but i have to set record straight here after seeing all these positive high ratings on this place.

I live in the neighborhood and am a sucker for local business owners and love to contribute to everything local but i've been here twice wanting to like this place cuz its so close to me but i was sadly disappointed.  My first visit i got the gyro which should be the staple of any greek joint and the avgolemono soup.  First the gyro, i'm not sure if i'm just used to portions at gyro spots on the east coast but what i got here was a joke..... Everything was all chopped up and mixed together??? And very small amount of meat. I'm typically used to getting gyros with nice big shavings spilling out of the pita..... Here you could take the whole pita and practically envelope the contents..... 4 big bites max and you are done. For the price, no fries just gyro its super weak.  Next the soup...... Rice not cooked, barely any chicken not worth the time, again poor execution.

Second visit/chance i had people in town from back east itching for a greek salad, for some reason i came back..... I guess i wanted to give a local business a 2nd chance to impress.  So i went for the greek salad thinking how can you mess that up right?? Well guess what the salad was more pitiful then the gyro..... First issue.... Who charges $8 for a salad and uses mostly iceburg lettuce!! Strike one, next there was shredded carrots in it, probaby from the pre-pak iceburg salad mix?? Strike two....... Lastly they put one chinsy little salad dressing in for the salad! What a joke.  Others had ordered soup despite my warning, i tried that again..... Very inconsistent to the soup i had, even less chicken.

Overall pricey for what you get, won't be back.... You can catch me being happy going a little farther for the guy up the street."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for the first time this week. We both got the gyro platter and it comes with pitas, Greek yogurt sauce, rice, string beans, onions, and tomatoes. It was pretty good and we'd order from this place again."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood so based on the reviews figured I'd give it a try. I typically get the basic gyro pita the first time at a new place but they had a special \" seasoned ground beef in pita with fries, onions, cucumbers and yogurt sauce.
Was disappointed as it was basically an already Cooked hamburger patty ground up on the grill top with many pieces of it burnt. Did not taste ant seasoning in the beef at all.
Side salad was your typical Greek salad. 
Unfortunately, I won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"What a jewel.  I had some time to kill and needed to grab something to eat.  
I expected the typical Greek restaurant with decent food - lean meats and nice flavored, and got something exceptional.

They had a lamb chop special I had - very flavorful but not overwhelming flavored - very tender.

I also got the feta and olives.  It was a large pice of feta (about 4 oz is my guess).  It had a smoothness that is not normally found in feta with a touch of creamyness to it.  The best feta I have had and I have tried a lot over the years.
I mentioned to the cook (owner?) that I thought it was he beat feta and he said they tasted several and choose he one they likes the best.  Which tells me that he not only can tel favors but cares to put good ingredients into his food.

I am not In this area is town often but I will defiantly be back here when I am in the area (even if it is just to grab something to take home )."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST in the area.
Owner was very hospitable. Felt like I was eating in a families home. We had the Philly Gyro and the Chicken Souvlaki.
Chicken was AMAZING, juicy and home made Tzatziki was the best I've had 
Make it a combo and get those amazing fries. Great place, CLEAN and homely 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE  

This is now our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review to a small business but my gyro was disgusting.  It was so bad that I was worried that I was going to get food poisoning, but luckily I did not.  There were a lot of mixed reviews for the place and I should have listened to the bad ones. How can a Greek restaurant make a staple like the gyro so badly? Only the pita was edible.  Sorry :("}
{"text":"Extremely nice staff! I asked what he recommended for the appetizer and he suggested the htipiti, which was amazing! The gyro was so delicious. I pushed myself to finish it because it was that good. 

As mentioned, lots of people ordering online from Postmates/Uber eats from here, as multiple drivers came in to pick up orders. 

I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Quick and easy stop for lunch. I had the gyro and fries combo. It was fresh and hot! The fries were well seasoned and also piping hot. Great combo for a good price."}
{"text":"Holy Greek salad goodness, Spartan knows how to make a MEAN Greek salad! And that says a lot coming from me, i've had just about every Greek salad in the Valley! :) The veggies are SO fresh, chicken kabobs were grilled to perfection and the homemade vinaigrette dressing was light and perfect. We also got their \"Greek Poutine\" which was a bowl layered with french fries, feta cheese, Greek green beans w/red sauce (a Greek tomato sauce) and topped with feta again. I could literally eat these all day, every day, they were SO good! My boyfriend had the Gyro Cheesesteak and was raving about it the entire time that he was eating it. I had a bite and oh my goodness, it really was amazing. If you're looking for a quick, easy, fresh, and delicious lunch or dinner spot. This is your place!!!!"}
{"text":"Little Gem: Food was delicious, we loved the gyro pita, chicken Slovaki plate, and tzatziki. 
Great service, reasonably priced. Someone finally got it right!"}
{"text":"An awesome little greek place!! Reminds me just like food in Michigan. Stop in for a gyro, spanikopita, or some chicken lemon rice soup. Oh and dont forget the greek fries."}
{"text":"I would give more stars if I could because this is the best Gyro I've had. We ordered the gyros not knowing that there were tomatoes. I am unable to eat tomatoes due to allergies and upon seeing this the owner insisted on making another one for me that I could eat. Service like that is hard to come by and it absolutely made my day. Everything is made fresh in house, even the pita bread. Each bite is a delicious flavor expulsion in your mouth. I will be sure to come back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"I had the spartan chopped salad with chicken and it was excellent. The fresh dill made the salad. I tried to recreate it at home this weekend!  Service was fast, portion was generous.  Food tasted terrific. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Food is so good and fresh...love the tzatziki! Can't lose with their gyro pita and chicken Souvlaki pita."}
{"text":"Best new gyro/Greek place around! Delicious gyros, veggies, spicy feta and salads. Adding this to my weekly takeout! Affordable and great portions. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. The food was good and well portioned for the price. With that said, nothing was all that noteworthy. Atmosphere and service were alright. If you're in the area looking for some good Greek food, this place can satisfy your cravings. However, I wouldn't drive half-way across Phoenix for it. Chances are you have a Greek place just as good in your own neighborhood."}
{"text":"Blown away by this place. Usually eat at Z's or Chicago gyro once or twice a week, but wanted to give this place a try. After I ordered and paid, I watched the cook go over to the sink and wash his hands before cooking. I thought this place had a better tasting pita, better tasting gyro meat and better tasting tzatziki sauce than both Z's or Chicago gyro. I like how after they cut the gyro meat they put it on the flat top and crisp it up a bit. I am looking forward to trying their 300 burger next visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night for dinner after reading the rave reviews on Yelp!  This place definitely did not disappoint.  I thoroughly enjoyed my gyro with a side of green beans...both so tasty and filling!  Laid back, casual atmosphere and a friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I was excited to discover there was a Greek place nearby where I was working temporarily. I headed right over the first chance I got. It was pretty meh. The soup tasted like fake lemon. The rest was not memorable."}
{"text":"Best gyro in AZ. Greek owned 
Thats why its good 
Gyro on the spit hot & fresh 
Real Greek yogurt 
If its not greek owned don't go there
This place is all fresh food, not frozen."}
{"text":"It's always fun to be the first reviewer of a new restaurant.

Let me start out by saying that I tried a few things on their menu, and I was very pleased with all of them.  I had an order of hummus and fresh vegetables (carrots, celery, and cucumbers), french fries, Greek-style green beans. and a taste of gyro meat from another order.  Everything was fresh, the flavors were tasty without being overwhelming, and the restaurant was very clean.  I love hummus, and this hummus was right up there with the best.  The gyro meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  I liked the Greek-style green beans; the sauce was flavorful and had a little hint of spiciness.  You don't see this style of green bean at too many of the gyro places around town.  The french fries were very good - hot and crispy like they should be, but nothing to rave about.  They do have \"Greek fries\" on the menu with feta crumbles - perhaps this would push ordinary fries into the extraordinary fries category.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

I live right around the corner, and I am sure that this will be a favorite place to get many future dinners to go.  The dining room is quite small, but it didn't feel cramped.  I am sure that most people will probably take their orders to go.

I don't feel like I tasted enough of the menu offerings to give it a solid five stars without reservations, but based on what I sampled today, I am very optimistic that this will be a favorite.  If you're thinking about trying it, but want to hear from other diners first, you have nothing to fear.  You'll like this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  So happy to find a low-cost, friendly little Greek place in the center of town again -- we've been bereft since Cyprus Grill left Town & Country. This place is a little further east, but not too far, and it's clean, inexpensive, fast, and tasty!

We shared the fried calamari, hummus & veggies, and a chicken souvlaki plate. Everything was flavorful, hot & fresh, served up quickly and by a very friendly staff. The calamari was served with a light marinara-like sauce (not thick and heavy), lots of flavor. The hummus was smooth and creamy and paired well with cucumbers, carrots, & celery (there's also a hummus plate with pita). 

The souvlaki was served with rice, green beans, thick toasted bread, & chopped onions & tomatoes. The tzatziki sauce was thick and rich with flavor. Plenty of food, it was perfect split between two people. 

We finished with \"Boom!\", the dessert with no name - Greek yogurt with honey & walnuts, served with fried pita sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar. Oh, MY. This is worth everything, right here. SO good!

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For under $10, you can get a fresh, authentic meal at Spartan that will fill you to bursting. I usually go with the Greek pita. The lamb is cut from the bone in front of you, the pita is soft and warm, the tzatziki is to die for, and all that is topped off with freshly chopped tomatoes and onions. Niko, either the owner or manager, is always there with a contagious smile and happy demeanor. The decor is clean and minimalistic, and the shop is always pristine and cared-for. I'll sometimes go to Spartan several times a week...it's that good."}
{"text":"Best fast-casual Greek place in Arcadia, that's saying something considering there are a few really good fast-casual Greek places in Arcadia.

The Greek fries are phenomenal, the perfect amount of garlic/feta/lemon. The best thing they do, in my opinion, is the grilled lamb chops they offer during the weekends (Fri-Sun). Less than $20 for really great lamb that is coming from a place no bigger than a storage unit. 

They also offer takeout and delivery options with some of the online delivery platforms, so if you want to order ahead just go that route. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great new Greek spot!  Right off of Thomas across the street from the Fry's.  The interior is all newly done and my girlfriend says the Greek salad w/ chicken is awesome!  Waiting on food now but impressed with cleanliness of interior and looks like it'll be good"}
{"text":"Probably the best hummus and pitas I've had in the valley. The combo (chicken and gyro) was glorious. I'm not a fan of green beans usually, but the red sauce they serve them with was super good. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"The gyro sandwich was very good and the fries are not too bad either. A trip to this place will be worth it for everyone.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"We have really enjoyed this place and have come back over and over again.  The owners (both named Nick) remodeled the restaurant and that was a huge improvement.  But more importantly, the food is really, really good!  We have had the gyro, chicken souvlaki plate, greek salad, 300 burger (burger with feta cheese and gyro meat on top) and other dishes.  They make home made tasting meals and they are both just the nicest guys too.  Worth a visit or 10!"}
{"text":"Took a while for me to try this place out since getting in and out of that area is a mess with construction. In my opinion it's no better than surrounding gyro spots. My husband humored me and went despite not liking mediterranean. He had a burger that was so done, I'd say was borderline charred. Fries were ok, they were warm and very lightly seasoned. We had like 3 sides of fries all were under cooked. The tzatziki was VERY thick like cold sour cream in consistency, I'm a lover of tzatziki and was happy to see many reviews say it's bomb. For me it was lack luster. I may be back but maybe not, same level as Z's Greek... BUT they have a drive thru.. I'll always try and save my cravings for when I'm up by gyro house! (Cactus & 32nd)"}
{"text":"The family was in the 3rd or 4th day they were open and had a great meal. I had  a gryos-the pita and tzaziki were really good making it stand out from other places, plus the have the cone instead of the strips of meat most places use, which is always better. The side of fries was really good as well. The wife got the pork souvlaki plate- the Greek style green beans were really good and the side of grilled bread instead of a standard pita is a nice change of pace. As for the pork, it was probably the best pork souvlaki I've had outside of Greece, well other than my dad's. As good as the gyros and souvlaki were the real stars of the day were the 300 Burger my son ordered and the Htipiti. The 300 is a nice sized burger topped w/ gryos meat, feta, red onions and tzaziki, great idea and great mix of flavors. Hitipit is a dip made of feta and peppers- not super spicy but enough heat to bring real flavor. You don't see Htipit on menus too often, I think Spartan may be the only place in the Valley with it. They do this dish extremely well, not sure if I've ever had better anywhere. This is defiantly the dish to try at Spartan. As much as we love the gyros place a little north of here on Indian School, Spartan is already the family's new favorite."}
{"text":"Great place for a bite to eat

We were looking for a quick and light lunch when we came across Spartans. If you enjoy Greek food, you should try this place.  Spartan is the real deal, their food is really good, the restaurant is clean and inviting, the staff is acomdating, in fact you will feel right at home when you walk in.

My lunch companion and I both ordered the gyros with fries. The gyro meat was nicely grilled, tender, seasoned perfectly, and the tzatziki sauce was absolutely delicious.  The portions at Spartans are large, prices are wallet friendly, and ingredients fresh. On my next visit I am going to try the pork souvlaki and Greek style lamb chops. 

If you're in the mood for Greek food give Spartans a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food comes fresh and hot very tasty and def genuine service. I recommend this spot to anyone looking for great gyros/greekfries/Philly Baguette."}
{"text":"I got a chicken souvlaki pita and my husband got a Philly gyro. We also tried the Greek fries and spanokopita. Everything was absolutely delicious and definitely up to my standards. The reviews are true- The best pitas and tzaziki sauce I've had in a looong time. Look forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot! The owner was extremely friendly and helpful and even recommended an off menu item... Try the Philly Gyro! Looks amazing inside and good food! Definitely check it out..."}
{"text":"Fist time ever. Great Greek French Fries, with feta cheese and I'm now addicted to them. The place is clean and comfortable. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"First time here but I've tried almost all in this hood. I got the combo gyro plate. Def enough for two ppl. They are skimpy AF with the pita but you can buy extra. HUGE portions even with the side salad. They don't offer a side salad in the menu which sucks but offer with meal and the girl couldn't get that I wanted a side salad. This will be my go to. The chicken was perfect, the rice and beans were on point and the tatziki is thicker and I like that it's not runny."}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the best gyros I've ever had. Quaint little place, and always terrific service. If I'm in the mood for Greek, I don't even consider anywhere else!! And I LOVE the feta & olives plate...huge block of feta & plenty of kalamatas...for $5!! Mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I love having another Greek option in the 'hood...

Spartan is a tiny little gem located on Thomas just East of 44th St, which makes it convenient for anyone who frequents the Target / Costco shopping center across the street.  

I've now been a few times for take-out and while it hasn't disappointed, it's not somewhere I'd drive out of my way for either.  That being said, if you are close by and craving a Gyro, Souvlaki, or Greek Salad, this is your place!

I've had both the Greek Salad with chicken and the Chopped Salad with chicken.  If you like dill, go for the Chopped!  You can't go wrong with the french fries or gyros either...

Ingredients are fresh, service is friendly and speedy, and the prices are right."}
{"text":"The short: Dependably tasty food with generous portions; good value; friendly and efficient service; no-frills, clean place; everything's cooked to order, and while service isn't slow at all, as a lunch spot, call your order in if you're on a time crunch. The only Greek place I've been to offering htipiti--feta and red pepper dip with pita--good and spicy!

The long: Plenty of parking in the strip mall on the north side of Thomas, halfway between 46th and 44th Streets. The restaurant is on the southern end of the strip. It's well lit with lots of moveable tables inside, and it's spacious, so good for groups, and there's always enough seating though it can briefly fill up during the most peak hours. I tend to walk in from my office right around 11, so there's usually only me and maybe one or two other tables seated.

Ordering at the counter is quick and easy, I often just get the special of the day--there's a lunch-ish special (e.g., pita and fries) and a dinner-ish special (e.g., spaghetti with side salad), and I often just default to that. Today I got the jalapeno mac 'n' cheese with chicken, which came with a generous side salad--perfect-size chopped lettuce, tomato, olives, a couple slices of raw white onion that I avoided because no thank you, and an overall sprinkle of feta. Consider asking for a plate or it will be a feta party. A con-feta party. As in, feta everywhere. I might use some of the light and tasty dressing--oil and maybe some kind of balsamic...maybe olive juice...brown. It's really just fine with the feta--it's really just roughage, anyway. 

The mac 'n' cheese was spicy! My taste buds flattened in fear and tried to flee into my inflated tongue--which means it was just right. And a generous serving, so if you aren't having a good gluttonous time, it can be two servings, three if you're dainty. Or normal-sized. Or large with a small stomach. I had a slice of cheesecake, too--I'd ordered the rice pudding, but they were out and gave me the option to sub in cheesecake or baklava--cheesecake is good--soft and creamy, pretty standard. The chicken was perfect--tender, just enough char to be exciting and not off-putting, and flavorful, though if you've submitted to the spicy mac 'n' cheese, you might just want the chicken to calm your mouth down.

This is a favorite lunch spot. I've tried about a third of the menu, and I've never had a poor meal here. Fries stay crispy the whole meal, meat's always good and tender, pitas are always soft and fresh, and one day, I'll remember to ask them to hold the raw onions. Kudos for free refills on iced tea and always having green iced tea."}
{"text":"Excellent gyro combo.  The meat is the best I've had in this neighborhood.   Fries were great!   Tzatziki  sauce was great.   Pita great!   Even the restaurant decor was great!   I will absolutely be back there.   Can't wait to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Super nice man that I believe is the owner, who made my soup from scratch. The Greek soup was something I've never had before, but that all changed when I took my first spoonful here. Absolutely delicious!!! Yummy spanakopita too!! I'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"They messed up my order yesterday, but they were very apologetic for making the mistake. The owner remade our entire order for free. I appreciate them fixing their mistake,and delivering quality customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad via Postmates just now to give this place a shot. The salad was so lazily done. The banana peppers still have the stems, the cucumbers are giant, and the olives still have pits (learned that the hard way). I, too, can throw ingredients in a box and call it a salad, but since I am paying for it, I was hoping a little preparation had gone into it.

Also, the gyro meat is super thick and still in long strips. It's not appetizing. 

It's a shame."}
{"text":"Nothing will kill my desire to re-order delivery from a restaurant quicker than \"inconsistency \". My first order from this restaurant went well..I got what I expected. I'd ordered hummus with pita, green beans with FRESH BREAD, and a gyro. This put this restaurant on my favorites list. The green beans were coated with a delicious tomato sauce and the bread was something I'd never had before. It was hearty, yet airy and light and grilled. This was what basically prompted my next order. But it wasn't to be. The beans were good, but where was my bread? Did they really just give me more pita bread? Why yes they did. The experience was just not the same. Even in delivery the little things count.

Edit: The food I received from Spartan was really good,though."}
{"text":"YUM! Great quality and prices, plus friendly service! No complaints!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. What turned me off was the girls  sitting in the counter where the food is being served. Felt bad for her. She must have been really tired. And her phone was way more important than bringing us our food that sat on the counter for I do not know how long, before I noticed it there. Need to work on customer service for sure."}
{"text":"Just ordered through ubereats. I am staying at a hotel read the reviews and thought I would try it. This is not good greek food. The avgolemono soup was made with artificial lemon. The souvlaki had no flavor. I have been in phoenix for 4 days and have yet to find a decent place to eat. Sad. To top it off I had no utensils. I had to eatv everything with my hands."}
{"text":"I visited here later in the evening and enjoyed prompt service and fresh food. I liked the chicken pita and salad that I ordered but wished for a little more flavor in the tzatziki and a better quality of greens in the salad. Absolutely zero complaints but also not backflip worthy."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this little place. Great food and prices. The owner and employees are very nice and will see to your every need. The pitas are fresh and warm when you order. Everything is freshly made each day. The gyros are the BOMB! When in Phoenix, stop by and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very good!! Meat had great flavor, fries were super delicious, portion sizes are huge. Staff was very friendly and my order was made upon ordering and it was served hot and fresh. 

Tiny place but clean and welcoming! A little bit pricey tho!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant located in the heart of Arcadia, deliscious food and fun atmosphere. I was here on a fundraiser event, and ordered a gyro sandwich. It was delicious and tasty. I also had the avgo-lemono soup which I highly recommend (made with yogurt, lemon, chicken, rice and eggs) and it is just out of this world. I also ordered the \"dessert with no name\" dessert, and I highly recommend it, it's fried pita bread, with honey, almond, yogurt and cinnamon. My Dad ordered the Greek burger, and my mom got the pork souvlaki. They both liked their meals (souvlaki comes with rice and green been stew-very delicious) 

I definitely would recommend this place, and I'm definitely coming back here for more."}
{"text":"The food here was quite glacia flavorful.i had the combo plate with chicken and pork and really enjoyed it. I was also treated exceptionally well by the friendly staff and will be visiting again to try something new! Thanks for a good treat, especially after a long day of work."}
{"text":"I had a gyro pita combo with side salad yesterday. It was sooo good!! They have real lamb and not those frozen slice things people use from the stores. Everything was made fresh and I'm going back today"}
{"text":"Food was very yummy, not to mention fresh! Husband and I had the gyro and fries platter and it was excellent. Pita bread was nice and fluffy, and the sweet potato fries were super good. We love coming here!"}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a guy who enjoys a good gyro, and pretty good at determining what makes a good one. Let me just start off by saying that I didn't think the gyro was anything amazing or special, but it was good. I prefer more tzatziki sauce than what they put on it, and it's not as stuffed with meat as others I've had. If I were just judging by the gyro itself, it would probably be more like 3 stars

What made this place a 4 star is twofold. One: the restaurant itself was extremely clean and updated, and the bathroom was really nice. Two: get the Greek fries. They are really good fries loaded with feta cheese and they bring lemon slices to squeeze on the fries. Add your own salt and pepper to your own liking and that's what really makes this place good and not just average."}
{"text":"Flavorful, plentiful, and cheap is a great combination and Spartan nails it. $7 gets you a gyro loaded with delicious and flavorful meat (seriously, the pita is overflowing with meat), onion, tomato, and tzatziki. Everything I've had there has been really good and equally generous in portion relative to the price. It's a counter service place but it has a newish, comfortable dining area and is very very clean. If you're looking for simple but delicious Greek food at a great price, this is your place."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little place and boy have I been happy ever since ! Amazing food ! Fresh and delicious ! Whenever I get a craving for takeout I choose here ! One of my favorite local spots in phoenix !"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Everything from the salads to the gyros, fries and the hummus and pita sides are well done and tasty.  Great value for quality food."}
{"text":"Had some friends mention this place.  Best gyro I've had in Phoenix.   Prices are right too.  I'll be frequenting this place for sure."}
{"text":"The lamb chops are amazing! FYI they only sell them on the weekends. This is a little trendy spot that you would overlook unless you knew it was here. In addition to the special of the day that I had, there are so many menu items which look delicious. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The pork souvlaki was really, really good, and I like that the grill is right there in front of you at the counter.  We ordered to-go, and watched our food prepared right there while we waited.  The customer service was also really good."}
{"text":"So i visited Spartans less than a week after they opened. We haven't been back. We loved Elie's and was excited another Greek/Mediterranean place was going in that location. While seeing the gyro loaf there on the spit was kinda nice (that whole kinda knowing where your food comes from before you consume it), the meat wasn't anything to write home about. For the 3 of us to eat dinner, it was quite pricey."}
{"text":"Well this Establishment has very Rude staff and the cook wasn't very nice at all I Didn't get a chance to order I walk out"}
{"text":"I loved my experience here at Spartan. The staff was really friendly and appeared to me that they know what their doing. There was a carousel of delivery services picking up from there which tells me their online presence is superb as well. 

I enjoyed the Gyro and kept it classic and my little lady enjoyed her chicken salad. The taste was superb and will be back. Their menu has some good eats on it. I'm definitely looking to come back or order in again in the future."}
{"text":"Try this for the first time great customer service and great authentic food. I really enjoyed their lamb gyro. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's only been a few weeks since they opened, but I had heard about them through an associate, and he said they were clearly better than their local competition.  

I ate there yesterday and I think I'll go back at some point, but I'm still not convinced on a few points.

11:30am, two guys working.  One taking orders and doubling as grill assistant.  The other was, I'm assuming, the owner, who was on the grill. 

I only ordered a Chicken Souvlaki Pita and the appetizer Hummus and Pita, so I qualify my review by saying I do need to try more of a sampling of their menu.  When I do, I'll update my review.

Order taker was friendly and efficient, and greeted me with a smile.  He took my simple order and I told him it was \"to go\".  He acknowledged.

********************************

PROS:  Hummus was chunky, not smooth, which is how I prefer it.  I like chunky hummus, but that's just my preference.  I'm going to guess it was made in-house.  I could taste the tahini (sesame paste) and I'm pleased with that.  Hummus without tahini is hardly hummus at all, and is just sad.

Pita triangles were adequate in number for the size of the appetizer (I didn't run out) and they were soft and tasted freshly warmed.  

Olive oil on top and two kalamata olives completed the presentation.

Chicken Souvlaki Pita had some of the best tasting Greek chicken I've ever had.  Grilled to perfection, with large, juicy, well-seasoned (marinated) chunks of breast meat.  Very good flavor!

Tzatziki was plentiful.

Lettuce, tomatoes, etc., were fresh and tasted fine.

**********************************

CONS:  Waited a long time for my 'to go' order.  That is not a big deal, especially if they are cooking the food hot and fresh, which was the case.  Grill person apologized for the long wait.

While I was waiting, the order guy brought out the hummus appetizer I ordered and put it down in front of me on a plate.  When I politely reminded him it was a \"to go\" order, he said something about \"I thought you wanted the hummus here, and the chicken pita for take-out.\"  No.  When I ordered, I said I wanted it \"to go\".  Hmmmmm.

So he took it back and gave it to me in a 'to go' container, resting on a paper sandwich wrap, when my sandwich was ready.

Order taker also handles food when he's not taking an order.  99% of the time, he washes his hands before handling the food.  Not 100%, but I have to give it to him... he's almost there, and I appreciate that greatly!

Hummus was just okay, flavor-wise.  I tasted the tahini, which is good, but it was pretty bland after that.  Maybe that's their style, but a little roasted garlic, lemon juice, a dash of cayenne and a kicked up olive oil would make it better.  That's just my opinion.  

Pita is adequate, but wasn't anything I couldn't get from a supermarket.  I think an olive oil brush and some more time on the hot grill would help a lot.  Give me slightly charred, toasty pita bread that is still soft in the middle and you've got me.

The Chicken Souvlaki Pita had great-tasting chicken (as I mentioned), but my last bite had a huge, honkin' piece of GRISTLE in it.  It ruined the sandwich for me.  

(I'm a home cook, and I've trimmed thousands of chicken breasts.  When you've trimmed your first 50, you pretty much know where 99.99% of the gristle is.  Seriously.  I'm assuming they prep and trim their own chicken in the restaurant, so there's really no excuse for that.  It's a deal killer for me.)

The tzatziki was plentiful, but runny, not thick.  It was hard to call it flavorful when it was so thin.  I'm guessing if it was thicker, the flavor of the cucumber, garlic and olive oil would come through better and give it a creamier, more luscious feel.  They're very, very close, in my opinion.

PRICE:  I think their prices are on the high end, comparatively.  

My Chicken Souvlaki Pita was $6.25 with no 'sides' (\"make it a combo for only $2.95 more\", for a total of $9.20), and the appetizer Hummus & Pita runs $4.50.  My bill was $10.75, before tax.  Not ridiculous for fresh, hot food, but more than other places I like.

Under their \"Dinners\" menu, you will find plates starting at $11.95 and topping out at $13.50.  THEN, below the heading \"Dinners\" you read, \"add crumbled feta for $1.50\".  What?  A Greek dinner costing between $11.50 and $13.50 has an up-charge of $1.50 for crumbled feta?  Seriously?

Like I said, I will most-likely try them again, and try a wider range of options on their menu.  I think I'll give them a bit more time to trim off the rough edges (and the gristle, hopefully!) before I visit a second time.

\"A\" for effort.
\"C-\" for execution."}
{"text":"This place was really good just wasn't the best I've had in the valley. Seems like I find a gyro place with great fries and not so great gyro then vice versa.  That was the case here.  The Greek fries were great though I'd like some Greek dressing or something on them so they aren't just fries with feta but we're still good.  The gyro was just alright.  It tasted like the meat was almost getting stale and the pita was ripping open because there was so much meat it was impossible to get all flavors in a bite.  Just meat."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was so sad when Elie's Deli left but am so happy Spartan took up its real estate. The Greek fries and chicken pita are a staple in my house. My husband loves the combo plate. We go here at least once a week, get it to go for dinner. It's always waiting for me when I get there. I love their food."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty stuff served up here in this corner Greek restaurant. It's a bit tucked away in a non-descript strip mall but the Chicken Souvlaki served up here definitely made the trip worth it.

The Souvlaki ($6.79) was great! Big juicy bites of chicken charred perfectly and served up with onions, tomatoes, tzatziki, lettuce, on a warm pita. Friend's thought his gyro was good but thought it had too much sauce and shouldn't have placed it on top. (He's been too many kebab places though so can be nitpicky) Alas, I took no photos because I ate my wrap too fast. (Sad Face) 

Definitely a place to check out when you want something good and fast."}
{"text":"If you're looking to stay out of the chains and spend your hard earned money at a locally owned place...this would be a good one. I would recommend the chicken pita....yum!"}
{"text":"Salads and chicken shawarma plate were very subpar. The salad came with at least 4 tomatoes sliced in half. 

I would stick to the gyros."}
{"text":"The gyro pita was just was this pregnant girl was craving! I can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu. Friendly staff and I got my order quick. I'll definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great new Greek place. We got gyros fries salad and a slice of baklava. Everything was fresh and was really good! Owner was really nice too and is actually Greek. My only complaint is that the baklava is $4 for a small half slice.. For that I'd expect to pay about $2.50. Then again id pay the $4 again bc it was that good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was okay at best. We had a gyro and the special if the day- which was some type of beef patty. The beef patty had some type of odd flavor that I really can't describe and the gyro was just a plain normal gyro. We typically love Greek food but will be going to other places in the in the future."}
{"text":"I tried the pork pita as well with the Greek Fries and had an explosion of flavor, I must say it was good for a first try, will definitely try other options on the menu"}
{"text":"Haven't had Greek food for many years and, wow, was this place good! It's just a small place, easy to miss. But the flavors were excellent and service was great. We went with the gyro, of course. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great find.  Awesome authentic food!!!  The staff was very helpful and we discovered the owner Nick  is the chef.  I really like places where the owner is cooking because they care about the customers.  Best Gyro"}
{"text":"I came back yesterday for lunch, since I've been craving a pita and salad. The service was just as fast and friendly as before, but there were a few things that sort of killed it for me. I got the chicken pita this time, and the chicken pieces in it were huge. I'm talking like almost chicken nugget sized and really thick. I know it sounds weird to complain about that, but it made eating the pita quite difficult. On top of that, the outsides of the chicken were burnt and charcoal-y tasting. The biggest bummer though, was the side salad. I ordered a side salad and drink add on again, but the salad I got was just a basic salad with balsamic vinaigrette. I thought maybe I simply ordered it wrong (salad instead of Greek salad), but when I looked over the menu again, there was only a Greek salad as an option. I didn't have time to inquire about it, but it was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall Greek restaurant in Arcadia. I've enjoyed various dinner platters and the tzatziki is delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through Postmates a few times and it always tastes fresh! Love their chop salad, tasty hummus and gyros. Definitely plant to try more!"}
{"text":"I would live to give it 4 stars but I had to subtract a star: chicken was tasty-but very sparse-my Chicken Pita was mostly lettuce and tomatoes-with a big dab of sauce at the end of the sandwich.  The sauce was very tasty but would have loved it evenly distributed through the sammie or on the side.  The side salad was HUGE and full of fresh veggies and good dressing.  Amp up the chicken and I would be \"pita\" happy."}
{"text":"What a nice little place and thank goodness because we liked the Greek place that was there before. They have really great product high quality and a superb taste. We really have enjoyed the few things we have had not a scrap left behind. Nice guys working here very helpful. It's superb for the price get in there and give it a try."}
{"text":"We drove up from Gilbert for our dinner.  My husband was looking for a gyros pita so we decided to make the drive. We got here a little late on a Friday night. We had the whole place to ourselves. Guys don't pass this place up.    It's unassuming from the outside but great flavor awaits on the inside.  My husband ordered the gyros pita and added a small Greek salad.  I ordered the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  So happy with our choices. 

First of all they do the gyros right.  It's gyros on the cone not the strips.  Big win.  It's so hard to find gyros done right.  With the salad my husband was stuffed.  

My salad was huge. Actually you could probably share it between two people but I was starving so there was no sharing going on.  I added the chicken and so glad I did.   They gave you two nice sized skewers with all chicken.  No veggies on these babies. The chicken was fresh, marinated, and perfectly grilled. So juicy and great grilled flavor.   The dressing was great too. I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite.  

If your in the area and looking for some good Greek food. This is your place. Support  local small businesses."}
{"text":"Great tasting gyro absolutely loaded with their beef/lamb. So flavorful! Friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"Second time here and the owner has been there to work the counter and prep the food. Ive had the spartan burger each time so to me its best of both worlds. Beef patty and some gyro meat with tzatiki sauce. Generour portions fresh food clean place reasonably priced. He is very accomodating and even ended up swapping out the patty for a special patty that was part of the daily special that I just didn't read until after we finished order and cook had put regular burger on the grill. It's clear they want to have customers leave happy and come back for more. Ive had the salad and greek fries on the previous trip. I dont think Ive had the baklava or the dessert special they had up last time. For sure next time!"}
{"text":"This place is not a accurate representation of the score. There is other Greek places way better than this."}
{"text":"Great selection of Greek food. Started with a salad which was nice and fresh. Gyro was amazing! Very warm, even to the last bite. Bakalava for desert was also very delicious. Staff is very friendly, decor fits the tone as well. Great food, was stuffed and was not overall expensive. Taste of Greece right here in Phoenix. Definitely plan on returning soon. Look forward to trying other things on the menu as well."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, but most Greek restraunts leave me smelling like I cooked the food myself. Not Spartan Pita & Gyro, good exhaust fan and really nice decore. Food is excellent,  I especially like the Gyro and Fries. Meat is fantastic and fries are golden brown/crispy."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite go to Greek restaurant they deliver through UberEATS I just got off the phone with I'm assuming who is the manager Nick a guy that I dealt with a lot or the times I've ordered I've never physically went into the establishment  but me and Nick talked on the phone through my UberEATS orders, hands-down this place has the best customer service I will always be a customer at this establishment because they know how to take care of there people I'm ordering lamb chops with french fries and a salad. A fantastic place with fantastic food...thank you!"}
{"text":"It's cheap.  The food is excellent quality and authentic.  The staff is extremely friendly, and the kitchen moves fast.  So what if the eating area isn't luxurious.  [Get it go then, you snob!]  The Greek spaghetti for less than $10 is enough to feed a family of 4.  Perfect hole-in-the-wall lunch place."}
{"text":"Just had their hummus and gyro both were very fresh amazing food.. very nice friendly staff..I definitely recommend this place"}
