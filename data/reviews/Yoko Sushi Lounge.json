{"text":"Not the best AYCE Korean BBQ/Sushi joint in terms of value and quality.  Experience :  Guilty as charged, I'm a big eater, last time I was there, I had 50 pieces of Salmon nigiri and 20 plates of Short ribs and other kind of cuts of meat with my bro (from another mother). Everytime I would try to place a huge order, even a modest one, the staff would always ask : are you sure you want to order this much? Hell yeah, this isn't Weight Watchers's Sushi Lounge last I checked.   Quality :  Everything tasted bland with the only exception being the Short Rib BBQ, the only redeeming item that tasted heavenly.   Decor/Service :  The restaurant has an upscale ambience and the female staff are in black dresses, and many extremely good looking.  Disappointments :  They charge as much as a downtown AYCE BBQ/Sushi restaurant but offer a fraction of the menu and selection. There is NO SASHIMI here, only Nigiri. Actually, they charge extra if you want Sashimi.   L. John Dory Twitter: @LJohnDory"}
{"text":"Mutiple visits later, I am a fan! I love their table dhote! cheap, super tasty and abundant. Their entrees are great starting always with the yoko tuna (bit expensive but worth every bite! Big enough to share 2-3 people but I can eat it by myself I love it so much!) veggie and shrimp tempura.. Yumm! Miso cod...wow! The Korean bbq side is good but it's not my thing. It's fun tho. Ouhhh and they have an unlimited candy bar ! They give you a bag and u fill it up for like 1-2$ great for kids and adults like me lol"}
{"text":"Sis brought me out for my first sushi dinner since I finished chemo.  It was splendid!  The restaurant is beautiful considering where it's located, the waiter was wonderful, and the sushi was oh sooo yummy! My sister also introduced me to my first Lyche Martini. It was sweet, sexy, and intoxicating. Lol.  Will defiantly be returning. Hard to find good sushi in the east end of Montreal. It's a little pricy but it's sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking to go out for some Korean BBQ, only issue is looking for something outside of my comfort zone (downtown).  Thank goodness for this place, so many positives to list here:  __Lots of room between large metallic tables, a godsend compared to      cramped AYCE elsewhere. It helps with the noise level as well.  __Very well ventilated , the place or our clothes did not reek afterwards.  __Quick service, we ordered 3 times and it rarely took more than 15 minutes to get our orders.  __Great tasting food, there was almost nothing that went untouched, some food might have been OK, but nothing was inedible. I even tried baby octopus, just not my thing.  __Affordable drinks, SAQ prices + 7 dollars is pretty decent these days.  The evening menu has some premium items with beef being the center-stage. Our mistake is not asking for the names of the plates being brought to remember what was good. Some cuts are always going to be better tasting than others.   However, since there was only one type of chicken and one type of salmon, it made it sooo much easier to remember since it was delicious.  Clams, mussels, chicken wings, full shrimp (but no shrimp tempura), there are enough items even for a vegetarian or pescatarian diet.  We wound up staying 3 hours, but we never felt rushed to leave and kind of took it easy with dessert ice cream and jelly.  The price is $26.99 on week-ends and well worth it"}
{"text":"Belle petite perle dans un coin relativement pauvre en restaurant. Le service est typique des restaurants sushi de qualité c'est à dire efficace et poli. Nous avons choisi un menu qu'avec des spécialités mais elles étaient toutes excellentes. Une étoile (de mer) particulière à l'ensemble de leurs  sashimis. Un peu chère, mais un bel endroit pour se gâter!"}
{"text":"Another incredible place for the surprising location it's at. This place has really high quality sushi (for all the fish eaters). The mixed veggie vegan sushi they made for me was also delicious. Presentation is wonderful. Customer service is really good too. .  Marie the manager was super sweet and friendly. She made sure to be extra accommodating to my vegan requests and the waitress was really nice too.  This is definitely a great place to go to with a big group, but can also easily be enjoyed as a couple.  The korean buffet style side of the restaurant (Grill your own food) is also an awesome concept and a lot of fun to enjoy with a bunch of people. The different side options are fantastic and the whole overall experience is so much fun.   This place gets completely packed! We tried going on a Saturday night and it was completely full so we went back on Monday! I suggest you make reservations in advance.  I can't wait to be back in town and enjoy that experience again!"}
{"text":"This place looks nice but the ppl and foods is bad! I'd had Korean BBQ, it was salty over seasoning! Three dollars for tea refills! I can tell you more but just try it out your self!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for the Korean BBQ buffet. Good choice of meats and seafood. Some better than others but it's all about trial and error. Bbq'ing as a group really adds to the experience. The tables are large and roomy. Even though there are tv's everywhere, it doesn't feel like a sports bar. Some maki's are available with the Korean BBQ which did not wow me. I would suggest sticking only to the BBQ options honestly."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. 2 hours from ordering to being served. Miso soup took an hour!!! They apparently had to make it!  Never again."}
{"text":"Sushi restaurant side: Excellent original variety of maki. Nigiri are ok, but sometimes the fish is cut a little thick to my liking. The specialties are excellent. Service for sushi is too long... I've been many times and you never get your sushi before 45 min, but at least once you get it, it's delicious. Still... I once waited 40 min for my appetizer!  Korean bbq side, all-you-can-eat The food is good... Some items better than others. It's different and there is a lot to choose from, including some sushi. It really makes for an enjoyable evening. The atmosphere is nice, lots of televisions and rock paths to separate tables. Very cool. To prevent waste, they charge you if you don't eat everything you order. However, there was a dish I didn't like and they didn't charge me when I told them I didn't like that particular dish.   Last note: they don't have changing tables, which sucks since you have to go to your car if a baby needs changing.   Waiters and waitresses are always friendly."}
