{"text":"I just moved here from Chicago where there's a huge Japanese community, so I was fairly surprised at the collection of goods sold here since there doesn't seem to be quite as large a group of Japanese people in Tempe.  The store is pretty spacious, and they sell the basic foods one would miss if from Japan like curry, udon, ramen, ochazuke, etc  They also sell some housewares and rent out a small collection of videos that have current Japanese tv shows recorded on them.  The prices are basically the same as where I'm from (which is slightly more than I'd like to pay), but that can be expected seeing as most things are probably shipped from Japan.   Still, the people are nice, the goods are plentiful, and the prices are sort of right, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best value sushi in town. 

For only $6 and some changes, I got a bowl of sushi with 4 different kind of fish, a few squids, and fish eggs. What a bargain! The fish are in thin slices, and arranged beautifully. Well prepared rice with a bit of seaweeds. Served cold but not chill is another plus. 

The only downside is wasabi in a package. On well, it is still sushi in a takeout bowl after all."}
{"text":"Yay for Fujiya Market! 
Tiny market tucked away in a corner, but worth the drive. I had no idea it existed until recently (yay to Yelp!). Since moving out here, I miss my Japanese ingredients, Japanese candies, anything Japanese (including shampoos & conditioners). That being said, it is a small market so the selection is somewhat limited, but it's better than any other place I've found in \"the valley.\" 
An added plus: you can get (for good price) a quickie meal (bento box, katsu-curry, etc). And it tastes Japanese (as opposed to having an \"Americanized flavor\")... you can tell it's authentic. This place has saved me on many occasions when I didn't feel like cooking and just wanted a premade meal."}
{"text":"Mini store which has everything! Delicious delicatessen and  a good variety of grocery and produce."}
{"text":"I like their lunch bentos and Saturday Ramens. 

Bentos are made fresh daily with wide varieties. Rames are limited quantity every Saturday. 

But, rest the market are not as impressive. The shelf always seem half empty with not much variety and not much fresh produce to be considered a market. 

I will treat this market as a quick grab n' go lunch market, but not going to expect too much other normal market functions from it."}
{"text":"I Love LOVE this place- and while I currently live in Chicago next to the Baron of Japanese Markets- Mitsuwa, I love this place even more. Although it is not as large as Mitsuwa and doesnt have the same variety, service is spot on and the prepared foods are delicious!!

I ended up buying a nigiri plate, and an unagi dish served on rice!"}
{"text":"The selection has gone down here :( and that totally makes me and the hubs sad, cuz there are certain things that we liked getting here, specifically. We hope certain items will come back. 

I like this store because the things we do buy here we can't find elsewhere. I also like the variety and quality here. Rice varieties, eggs, nato, other Japanese foods (don't know they names of - sometimes I just try new things from the fridge ;)), etc. I know that they choose quality stuff here, so even though we are a bit far, we'll make the drive out!

The bento boxes are also delish! This is pretty much one of the few places where you can get bento boxes with the selection it comes with, so we enjoy it when we can! Tried pretty much most of them. Can't really go wrong, but if your picky, sorry... you're missin out!

Service is good. They employees are always helpful. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Delicious bentos, love the onigiri, good selection of groceries. Probably the best Japanese food in town for the fraction of the price. Tip: their refrigerated ramen tastes very similar to the one they serve on Saturdays. Give it a try and you'll save by making it at home"}
{"text":"Ok the first time I came here, I was very disappointed in the selection of items, especially after reading previous review. BUT, then I realized that I went at a bad time, it was the end of the day and they sold out of everything! I recently went back at the store opening time and a lot happier with the market. They sell freshly made bentos, made in house, and they are perfect for microwaving at home or in the market for a cheap and satisfying meal. The key is to get there early, bc they are limited and run out quick, but they have a good variety of bentos.

One draw back is that it is smaller than expected, so if you come from a place like SoCal, where Japanese markets were like large grocery stores with mini stores and restaurants located inside, you might not be too happy."}
{"text":"Really nice Japanese Market.
Everything very fresh and nice.
Only negative is slightly limited selection, I was missing a few products I couldn't find.
Prices are very reasonable.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great! The store its self is a little run down, lacks some merchandise, and is overall fairly bare; however, I didn't go there for snacks or ingredients! I went there for the meals they make fresh daily and man was I impressed! They had a variety of Bento boxes, onigiri, and even a sushi bowl! I finally found a place that makes authentic Japanese food, that's super inexpensive, delicious, and fresh! The Bento box was around $3.50, onigiri around $1.50, and the sushi bowl I believe was around $5. They don't have a ton to choose from but, what they do have I great! I went last Saturday and I have gone 3 times since! They also have a pretty good selection of Japanese drinks, candy, and snacks. Oh! There is also a cute little Japanese bake store next door and trust me I will be trying that out today! If you're looking for delicious, affordable, Japanese food this is the place to go! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"wish I could give this place more stars but the shelves here are pretty much always empty and out of stock items take sometimes as long as three months to get back in stock, no kidding...The staff is usually apparently unaware that you have entered the store or way to cool to be friendly-even my Japanese wife feels uncomfortable coming in this place..."}
{"text":"They sell bento boxes to-go.  There are fish, chicken, and combination Bento boxes.  It's a relatively cheap lunch - like $4 for a small Bento and $6 for a large one.  It's high quality food for the price."}
{"text":"Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year."}
{"text":"3-stars might seem a little low for a place that holds so dear to my heart but I assure you it's accurate.

Fujiya has been the best Japanese-only market I've found to date in any city, they have items I would have never dreamed to have found elsewhere!

While my friends constantly recommend places like Lee-Lee's and other Asian market's assuring me they have such neat Asian delicacies I adamantly refuse to stray from Fujiya knowing nothing can compare to the rare finds and fresh lunches they prepare.

There are unfortunately downsides to Fujiya Market, one being the hours of operation, I believe they normally close at around 7pm almost every day of the week.
I don't know what kind of person can get off work at 5pm and make it down to University & Priest on a weekday (not to mention friday) to still comfortably shop at Fujiya.

The only other downside to Fujiya and this being the largest problem I've noticed for the past ~4 years is the uncomfortable setting non-asians receive when shopping around.

I understand a large fan base of this Japanese market is annoying young anime watching teens but it seems to me that they don't prefer non-japanese speaking customers in general.

I receive no customary greeting when entering the store (as stated by Dan B.) and it is as if every time I go to ring up my incredibly large order of random Japanese foods the person at the till is sighing at me. This is more than a one time fluke as I've been a long time and most docile shopper here at Fujiya. 
So unfortunately 3 stars is all I've seen fit for this traditional Japanese Market. apologies for the long review!"}
{"text":"Visiting here for the first time and stocking up on japanese essentials this store while the shelves looked a bit bare, had all the items I was looking to buy including the refrigerated items. The prices were fair (compared to east coast where I just moved from) service was friendly, parking can be tight...did not try eating there this trip, but satisfied with sundry goods bought."}
{"text":"Only place I've found in the valley to get a variety of sushi grade fish so that's a huge plus in my book."}
{"text":"this a really great market, and they whip up some really fresh and cheap bento boxes, teriyaki bowls, and nigiri.  if you're going for the bentos, they are limited quantity and can sell out early... plan ahead!

this is a great little family owned business with quality products for a cheap price... support their business!"}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews about their ramen, we had to check it out. We arrived on time and were #11&12. They only had 30 bowls that day. It's not your regular restaurant atmosphere, it's more of small grocery store with a side kitchen. 
We had the soy based ramen and while the noodles were delicious, the soup( which I think is one of the most important part of ramen ) was too salty. There was only 1 slice of pork and not enough toppings for my liking. Not bad for $6 but I expected more."}
{"text":"Had Tonkatsu Ramen here on Saturday, not as good as when I was in Tokyo, but I missed this king of soups so much! The grocery store is great, with quality Japanese goods that are hard to get in Arizona."}
{"text":"Fujiya stocks Gentleman's Pocky while Ranch 99 doesn't. That's at least 3 stars right there.

(more stars perhaps if I ever go to Fujiya for anything else)"}
{"text":"First off, do not come here expecting a supermarket like Mitsuwa or Marukai. This is a very small space with authentic Japanese goods. I mainly come here for the bento, which is made in house every morning. The bento are pretty affordable ($4 for rice bowl, $7 for full bento) but they really pile on the rice so I tend to also buy a pack of natto to use with leftovers. I can get a lot of delicious meals out of this place.

Staff are nice and friendly. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"A little sad, sparsely merchandised (lots of empty spots on the shelves), and with a surprising amount of non-Japanese goods like Ziploc bags and Hunt's tomato sauce.  I did find one of the small individually wrapped shiro daifuku mochi in the \"grab and go\" case, and noticed they did have Lotte mochi ice in a standing cooler by the wall coolers.

Overall, I was really disappointed with their offerings.  New Tokyo, Lee Lee, and Super L are definitely superior.  All three carry multipacks of mochi, though only Lee Lee and Super L have the fresh stuff.  Maybe their focus is on the restaurant type spot at the front of the shop now?"}
{"text":"Small japanese market that has snacks and other food which seemed to be a tad bit cheaper than Mekong. The employees were friendly. They have a minimum of $5 purchase to use card, so have cash if you're planning to buy only one or two cheap things."}
{"text":"Small, but well stocked.  All of the Japanese basics are here.  It's nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart.  There's not a lot of fresh produce, but great frozen and dry goods options.  I'll have to try the prepared food sometime.  They were sold out for the day by the time I went in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Best Feature: Bento

Fujiya is noticeably different from most Japanese establishments in Arizona in that it's owned and run completely by Japanese.  As such, they run the place like a real \"conbini\" in Japan.  As you enter, all of the workers great you with an \"Irraishaimase\" and you can peruse the isles filled with certain things you can't find in the Japanese section of LeeLee (Like Gabunomi and Qoo).

The place reminds me of the Nijiya chain in CA.  The Bentos are pretty much the best in the area.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mugicha (??) aka Barley Tea. In the middle of the summer I was craving it and I usually bring back a number of boxes when I visit California. I found out that Lee Lee's carries it so I stopped smuggling it across the border. But then I went to Lee Lee's and a number of other Asian markets and could not find it. The one place that had it was Fujiya. They hardly have that much to offer but they definitely had that in stock - two different brands even. They probably feel it's a mandatory thing to stock otherwise Japanese students would be dropping like flies dying of thirst. Just kidding. Sort of. I had to have it for myself at least. Saved by Fujiya. New Tokyo Food Market on the west side has a lot more variety of Japanese goods but I didn't want to drive that far. One day when I remember to I'll come here for the Saturday morning ramen."}
{"text":"My bfs friend introduced us to this place where he gets a tray of those japanese sweet biscuits, and since hes off for the summer from teaching, he told us we can go get them instead because he wouldnt have that much income. Very cool little spot of japanese food and candy. Lots of japanese drinks like ramune and lots of ramen."}
{"text":"The main reason I go here is for the bento boxes (see example pic).  Made fresh every day, and when they're gone, they're gone.  On my way home from work it's a toss up whether there will be any left when I get there at 5:30.  I would by no means call them spectacular, but they're good enough that I stop in every couple/few weeks

I like to pick up some of the Nori Maki Arare as well (see pic)

One thing I wish they had more often is the Spam and Egg onigiri (see pic).  Very cool.  I'm told you can order them in advance, so may have to do that"}
{"text":"GO FOR THE SATURDAY RAMEN!!!
Or don't, so I won't have competition and can get it all for myself. 

I had the tonkotsu ramen today because it happened to be their special, and it hit all the right spots! Perfectly seasoned and reminded me of the ramen I recently had in California. Definitely come early though! They start serving at 11:30, I came in at 11:36 and they only had 25 bowls left! Also, don't be afraid to sit with random people because you're going to have to in order to eat your ramen. There's literally no tables! 

CHECK THEIR TWITTER OR FACEBOOK FOR UPDATES!
I will totally be coming back."}
{"text":"I wish Fujiya was closer to me now that I'm no longer a student at ASU.  The best bento boxes and rice balls (onigiri).  Plus they have my favorite brand of milk tea (kirin), it's not cheap, but what Japanese thing is?  Totally worth it by the way.  Everyone should go and try it.

Don't expect this place to carry everything you'd want (it's pretty small), but it has most of the basics and even some things that other places don't carry."}
{"text":"After living in California for some time amongst the different Asian groceries and markets, coming back to Arizona was sort of a culture shock. Then I found Fujiya. A little Oasis in the desert for Japanese grocery and sushi. Customer service is excellent, along with a variety of food items. One of my favorites are the Chirashi bowls which are spectacular! Average price of one is around $20. But at Fujiya, you can get one freshly made for a little over $5.00. All the sashimi is fresh... even the giant clam, which I'm not a big fan of, is delicious... Other items range from soups, to green tea ice cream, sushi ingredients, and more! Check it out the place sometime..."}
{"text":"There are many varieties of items to make sushi and other Japanese foods. I love the onigiri and the bento set here but you must be quick. It sells out quickly."}
{"text":"the Bento boxes are awesome, as well as the cheap sushi.
the yakiniku is by far my fav, next to the Spam onigiri.

: D"}
{"text":"This place and New Tokyo Market are the only Asian places I've found so far in Arizona that's really JAPANESE.    The store is pretty small but has enough things to stock up your pantry until your next trip to L.A.  

*Cosmetics/Bathroom = ok selection
*Rice = several kinds
*Snacks = plenty
*Dried stuff = plenty (Curry, Dried Seaweed, etc)
*Frozen stuff = good amount (Natto, Udon, Ramen, Tsukemono, etc)
*Drinks = good selection of Japanese soft drinks

The one complaint I have is that they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables.  You can find them in other markets like Asiana market or Lee Lee's."}
{"text":"one of the best places for sushi, bentos, and green tea. I've been a regular customer for more than 10 years. I don't know how they keep their prices so unbelievably great for the excellent quality they provide."}
{"text":"Instant lunch - pick up some excellent Sushi, or Beto Box lunch, along with Green Tee Ice Cream - instant picnic!  Quick and Easy!  I've enjoyed everything that I have picked up there.

Can't testify to the rest of the store as I've only done lunches from there - the people that work there are all very nice - definitely feels like a traditional Japanese store."}
{"text":"I love my Japanese food and when I need to satisfy my need for it, when I'm in Phoenix, I always think of Fujiya Market.

They have all the basic necessities to cook Japanese food. All the snacks and drinks that I  grew up with, I can find here. If you can't cook, they offer an array of daily made bento boxes for you to eat. But, you better get here quick! Otherwise, you'll find out that they'll sell out pretty fast. 

The last time I came here, it was on a Saturday. At opening, there were 12 people in line ahead of me, where the bentos were stacked. I saw 2 guys walk out with, at least, 5 bentos each. The bentos are also a college kid's budgeted dream. The price is a pretty good selling point.

Parking is small, but I've never had a hard time finding a spot. Staff is fairly friendly. Overall, this ranks a 3-star in my book. For a market, it's just hella basic, when I compare it to all the other Japanese markets that I've gone to."}
{"text":"I spent some time in Japan so I go here when I need a fix.  I stock up on the canned coffee and grab a couple of bentos.  Everything is authentic Japanese so it's like being back there again."}
{"text":"Great market; love the bento boxes.
Okay the selections are limited.
Good spot to go to when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly and they all speaks Japanese, their bento box are very tasty and of great price.
They only had ramen on saturday. We finally got to eat their ramen yesterday after been there the third time! First time we went there, it was at 12:30pm,
we didn't know they sold out so fast,  so we were unable to get the ramen, but their good variety of bento boxes still makes us both a happy customer. Second time when we went there, they were not selling ramen for couple weeks due to some kind of shortages. 
Yesterday, we were there when it open, finally got to try their pork ramen!! It was delicious, the soup base was very tasty, i didn't feel thirsty after eating the ramen. The pork was tender and great (wish we have more pork!). Just be careful it may need to wait for a bit before you can eat the ramen. We ordered around 10:45am and didn't get our ramen till 11:45am. But it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"So happy to get basic ingredients for cooking and great bento made fresh in the store. I always hit them up around the holidays for special ingredients and dishes."}
{"text":"Small but okay supplied market. The prices of pocky are a bit higher than those from Mekong Plaza but it provides a variety of pocky. There are three types of Poppin Cooking. Couldn't find a lot of Japanese ice cream"}
{"text":"Love this store! Their carry out is the best! It reninds me of when I lived in Japan during high school. It is a must stop on the way to the airport."}
{"text":"Good selection of dry goods, personal care products, and household items in a smaller Japanese market. I just moved here after living in Asia so glad that this market is so close to my apartment. I'll try the sushi next time. But I did check out the sake selection. That was nice too! I do yearn for fresh fruits and veggies there, but I'm still a fan. Nice smiling guys working there too."}
{"text":"No need to make the trip over but they have good lunch boxes (bento). The sauce was a bit sweet.  The prices are reasonable and the chef cares about his food.  Now on Saturdays they only serve about 30 ramens only at 11:30am.  He peeps them one at a time.  So it's not quick service.  The chef will prepare only one kind that day.  They set up tables so you can eat there.  If you're in the area stop by but if not no need to make a trek over."}
{"text":"They have everything you need as Japanese living in the United States. Even we are just driving through the town, I get better bento with very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awful, can't say too much more. nearly empty shelves, poor, poor selection of goods. Sadly disappointed in driving all the way over from the west valley especially when I was looking for \"Best Japanese Grocery\" because if this is the best Phoenix has a lot of room for improvements."}
{"text":"Love the options for a quick trip. I usually comer her to get curry mix, bento boxes and onigiri. I recommend calling ahead for the rice balls as they may not be ready. The staff is really nice and will try to help you the best way they can."}
{"text":"Small store that is easy to navigate work good customer service.  When my daughter wanted to make sushi at home for dinner it was easy to pick up the supplies here we needed-roller, rice vinegar, soy papers, wasabi, soy sauce, mochi, ramun.  We could not get avocados, sprouts or sashimi."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place! I come here for snacks, to beverages, to lunch time fare. Delicious onigiri. Mmmmm. Eat that and then go next door to the bakery for dessert. Yes please!"}
{"text":"Get their (salmon) bento boxes and their onigiri! I frequent this place a lot due to my current living arrangements, so I have seen their off and on days. It's great to go here when they are all stocked up for a quick lunch and a drink. Their inventory is pretty lack-luster but I feel like what they do have is good quality. 

In regards to the food, everything is super fresh and made with care! The people who work there are very polite. They have small and large bentos with a nice variety of home-made goodness.  The only thing I wish is if I could customize a pre-ordered bento a little bit. I understand that Fujiya is not a restaurant in regards to customization, but if it was, I would be a serious patron. The price for this surprisingly filling box is worth going to, if  you live near by. 

They need to make this operation bigger."}
{"text":"Quite a far drive for me, but worth the trip! The onigiri here is amazing!
They have a selection of interesting items but when I went it seemed that the shelves were quite empty in the dry grocery section.
There was a lot of stuff in the refrigerated section, especially in the drink cooler.
I didn't get to try them, but the bento boxes looked amazing.
They have a cute little dining area where you can heat up anything you buy and sit down and eat it.
The staff was very helpful and nice! They told us about getting free onigiri by simply liking them and checking in on Facebook!
I'll definitely be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best prices I've seen in this little store for Japanese staples like rice wine vinegar, hoisin, etc. Check out the frozen food and small cooler up front for freshly made bentos.

Every one is always so polite. This little corner grocer holds its own."}
{"text":"Visited this little shop during a school trip and was not disappointed. The cashier, Makoto, is very friendly and helpful. Although small, this oriental convenience store has a good selection of Japanese snacks and foods. My favorites so far have been the rice balls (that are prepared daily) and the frosted rice crackers."}
{"text":"Their lunches are delicious, authentic, and inexpensive. I've stopped in around dinner time and picked from what was left of their bento selection. It still tasted fresh hours later and it was discounted for clearance from an already excellent price. Their onigiri was tasty and very filling for an item that cost just over a dollar. According to the cashier, the chefs make the dishes in a certain order: bento boxes are prepared at 11:30 AM and the rice bowls are made around 12:30 PM. So, keep that in mind if you're stopping in for lunch. 

As for the market portion, the selection was quality but not extraordinarily large. It fit my needs as far as far as miso soup, nori, and mochi ice cream went. Definitely carries some hard-to-find items for reasonable prices, but it's a bit limited as far as markets go. Small produce selection, frozen/packaged meat selection was small in itself, didn't note any fresh meat. Good for treats and snacks that you can't find elsewhere, but don't go in expecting too much for home cooking supplies.

All in all, Fujiya Market will definitely become a regular lunch and treat stop for me. Can't wait to try their unagi bowl, especially since it seems so rare in even upscale local Japanese restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is a small location. Kind of like a hole in the wall. Even though it was small I was able to fill up my shopping cart. They have my favorite kokumoru curry. Most stores only carry one brand but this place has several. The pricing was reasonable. If you get a chance try their bento. It's very delicious. If you are looking for a store for your Japanese purchased this is it. Don't expect to find everything because it's a small store but you will happy that you stopped by."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced but given that it's the only market that sells real Japanese goods within the Tempe area, I guess you have the ability to charge whatever you want.  

What I do like the best about this place are the authentic Japanese treats (like dango and an-pan)!"}
{"text":"Quant Japanese grocery store with a decent selection on Japanese food. Not huge but has enough to make a"}
{"text":"This was such a lucky find. I lived in Japan for a year and have been severely missing it and the food. I was craving onigiri something fierce and did a yelp search and found this place. Unfortunately, by the time I arrived (4pmish) they only had three left, two salmon and one tuna. I really wanted the roasted kelp (my breakfast many times in Japan) but the salmon was good, just a bit salty. They also serve real ramen on Saturdays from what I hear and I am really looking forward to trying it out. They also have a great selection of drinks and snacks that bring back fond memories as well."}
{"text":"A small, mostly Japanese food grocery store.   I can't always find everything I need, but I do try to give this place as much business as I can.   The staff is always friendly and helpful.   There is plenty of take-out food available as well.   It is clean and well maintained and doesn't have an odor, which some of the larger Asian stores seem to have."}
{"text":"Each Saturday, there's a limited serving of Japanese noodles from ramen to udon to whatever. It's fresh and authentic. I have eaten ramen all over Japan, SoCal, NorCal and throughout the world. Trust me on this!

So this place is not a restaurant, by the way. It's actually a small grocery market that they set up some plastic chairs and tables in the corner of the store. You can actually buy bento boxes or other food items or drinks and sit down to enjoy it. It's a local Japanese grocery store!

Ok, but back to the ramen/udon. Each week, you can check on their facebook page for the noodle bowl of the week. You come in and order and there's really small staff in the back preparing your food. Everyone in there is Japanese and speaks Japanese. I actually sat with these two old Japanese ladies that came in for ramen and we talked about Japan and AZ when they first got here in the 1960s. That was awesome.

Like I said before, it gets pretty packed and they run out of noodles usually in an hour. Come early and eat the delicious food. You can walk over to the freezer and buy yourself a Japanese drink too. Afterwards, you can go next door to the Japanese bakery and get dessert.

There's really no other place like this in the Phoenix area so come try it out."}
{"text":"This store is a poor excuse for a Japanese market. They have a horrible selection, the prices are beyond outrageous and the customer service is a joke. I am disappointed to learn that this is one of the few Japanese markets in town. I'll drive to Marukai/Mitsuwa in Costa Mesa, CA before I spend another dime here."}
{"text":"I grew up eating bentos since I'm from Hawaii and I was thrilled to find this store. The bentos here are delish!! You do have to come early to get them tho since I believe they do run out quickly. I once stopped in during the mid afternoon and they were all sold out.  Now I usually stop by around 11 am.  

The store inventory is pretty low but I don't really care since I just come here for their bentos and aloha maid drinks."}
{"text":"Checked their hours online & called to verify *for that day*. Drove 45 minutes to their store only to see a sign that read, \"Be back in 2 hours.\" Absolutely absurd! Thanks for wasting my time & not informing me of this on the phone."}
{"text":"Although I did find the two items that I came for,  I was highly disappointed in this place.  It's small and has a lot less than I expected from a \"Asian market.\" The staff wasn't helpful and they didn't even acknowledge me being there until I checked out."}
{"text":"I love this place close to my work. Furikake. Next door bento place and Japanese bakery."}
{"text":"I've tried 3 times to make it in time for their lunch specials and its been sold out every time. I'll keep trying because the market is worth the visit itself. It has the cheapest ingredients for sushi (rice vinegar, seaweed paper, soy sauce) and it has sushi grade fish. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. They carry black sesame ice cream. Black sesame ice cream is my jam."}
{"text":"In Tokyo, this would be considered a very large location  with a very small inventory.

In Tempe, I consider this a family-owned Japanese QuickieMart.  It's a convenience store with Japanese fare.  Prices are very high and selection is very low.

The fresh produce as touted by several is disappointing.  

If it's a Japanese QuickieMart you are looking for, this is it."}
{"text":"Well, I'm Japanese and need Japanese grocery items and this store is conveniently located next to Arai Bakery and so when we go to one, we go to the other.

This is a small grocery, not much of an inventory, but they do have the basics. Need yokan? They have it. Need real negi? They have it, so you don't have to settle for just green onions. They have other produce that you can't find anywhere else. Just be aware that they have very little of it.

Just a little quaint, family-run, sort of convenience grocery store that might fill a few needs, but nothing comprehensive."}
{"text":"I found this place while searching around on google for Asian markets.  I was hungry and in need of sushi ingredients and decided to check this place out.  It's smaller than the other Asian markets in the area, but their products are varied and all the good brands.  I regret not buying a pre-made bento, but I'll have to come back next week to do so.  This may be my new favorite store."}
{"text":"A small family owned Japanese grocery store with many groceries and delicious bentos fresh made. I love coming here for the bentos that are at a good price! That and the curry pan from the bakery next door."}
{"text":"We consider ramen here as the best ramen in the whole Phoenix area. Their bento boxes are also very tasty. We visit this place regularly. Nonetheless, today I was disappointed with how I was treated. My fiancé and I ordered two bowls of ramen, jello coffee (you have to try it! :) ), and got one bento box. When the smaller woman at cash register told me how much I owe, my fiancé brought a bottle of green tea. I asked whether she can add this. She said she couldn't, as she already summarized everything. I thought \"No problem. I can pay separately\". After I paid for the food, she started scanning a bento box of the next customer. I asked \"Can I pay for the tea?\". Her response was \"He was here first, so\".  That was very awkward. I'm not sure whether she expected me to go to the back of the line now or what (and why?). She wasn't very nice. But as I said, the food is very good and cheap."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. I was torn between 3-4 stars.

The people working here are really polite and helpful.
The lunch boxes are pretty good, not something to kill for, but I'd rather go here than to some of the Japanese restaurants in Phoenix. If you're looking for something good, but don't have time to sit and order, this place is a great place to go to.

The selection of dried and frozen goods is pretty standard, not all of it is from Japan, I was super disappointed that the black mushrooms were all from China.

Things I found here that I liked:
-cups made in japan
-snacks from japan
-artwork and clothes \"designed\" by residents in arizona
-pretty good selection of dried and canned goods
-really polite staff

There are some awesome finds here, but don't count on this market to to blow you away; keep expectations low and you'll be surprised and happy when you leave."}
{"text":"For being a smaller store they have real good prices. Unlike some of the smaller asian stores here in town where they charge a lot. Fujiya is always stocked up with great items and is always clean and doesn't smell like some other stores. The staff is friendly and always helpful. The cashier girl is cute too!

They have the cheapest price for my favorite Japanese candy, only 0.69 for hi-chews!!!"}
{"text":"It was too late to pre-order the new year osechi; however it is not too late to get some sweet rice dessert to go instead. I wish my office is in the walking distance to this market. This time I got tempura lunch bowl and two rice onigiri for afternoon snack. Happy work day!"}
{"text":"I shop at this market weekly. I love the inexpensive frozen mackerel. Additionally, their fresh food is great. I enjoy bento boxes, onigiri, and eel bowls. Definitely worth trying! 

Con: They do have limited seating on Saturday's when they serve soup/ramen, etc."}
{"text":"This is a very neat little place! Small, but nice. They have a good selection and it's easy to browse. I picked up some mochi ice cream... delicious!"}
{"text":"Fujiya Market is a small hidden gem for those looking for Japanese groceries and or snack foods. They have a remarkable selection of items that one would usually find in a small corner market in Tokyo. 
I was looking for cream melon soda, and even though they did not stock it they were more than willing to order a case for me which came in in less than a week.
They have wonderful homemade bento boxes that you can take home and warm up or take with you to any place that has a microwave. The bento boxes are really delicious and well made. Paired with a cold soft drink from their large selection or a cold Kirin or Sapporo and you have a wonderful lunch or light dinner. 
They also carry a nice selection of snacks as well as a small selection of accessories that one would find in a similar type store in Japan. 
There is also an area with table and chairs where you can heat up your selection and eat it on the premises.

For the person looking for Japanese foods and snacks this is the ideal place,"}
{"text":"I came here right before they closed hoping to pick up some things from their deli. They didn't have a lot left in their select, a few pastries. I went with their Japanese cheesecake $1.99, which was so soft. It was very good! Almost like a sponge, angel food cake. I will definitely be back, but next time a little earlier."}
{"text":"Tiny little store, somewhat reminiscent of the stores in the Kinokuniya building of Japantown, San Francisco.  What really made me fall in love with this place was the sight of my favorite brand of frozen takoyaki!  Selection in general is limited, and they ran out of a few items when we were there, but this is still a great place to get Japanese items."}
{"text":"How come there are no decent super- or not-so-supermarkets west of ASU?  I really don't desire shopping at Circle K for my dinner of potato chips and beer.  However, I did spy this little Japanese market and descended on it like a displaced Asian American surviving in a state with an Asian population LESS THAN the national average of 4%!

Alas, since I had recently stocked up at Lee Lee, I was disappointed at the selection here.  Sure, they have a nice selection of sake and sauces, as well as other Japanese munchies (soy crackers and hyper-packaged candies), they didn't have any meats or produce!  Don't tempt me with bags of frozen gyoza and a freshly made $3.99(!!!)  unagi rice bowl when I'm trying to learn how to cook from scratch.

This may very well be a meeting place for Japanese Tempians, as they have a fairly active corkboard with messages both in Japanese and English.  They also have a bookshelf of Japanese language videos and mags, but its no Kinokuniya Bookstore.  Ah, San Francisco, I still miss you much!"}
{"text":"Okay, just got back recently from two weeks in Japan and was craving some of the food one can get in a Japanese convenience store, of which there are many in Tokyo. Stopped in on my way home from work and while not the selection one would have in Japan some wonderfully reasonably priced bentos (about $4), and rice balls, including one with my beloved salty plum paste, and as I grew up in Hawaii, I was happy to pick up the last remaining spam musubi they had in the fresh food area! 

As someone else noted, a lot of space but not that much inventory but hey, I'm happy just to be able to pick up a bento and and I'm going to come here a lot as it is not only authentic but it does not break the bank. If you like Japanese food, good place to stop. I am sure you will find something worth buying! :-)"}
{"text":"Didn't eat here. But I heard good things so I will eat here next time. This time, I just bought some mochi. It was cheap ($1.69 each) and delicious. This store was small, so the selection is a little limited, but still great. There are many things I can get here, yet many things I can't get here. Solid four stats because it's small. I really like it, but it's still small."}
{"text":"Adorable little market with a good selection of things. Candy, snacks, food type items, and pre-made lunches. The workers there are very polite and helpful. And yes, if you were wondering, they *do* have Redbean pastries in the freezer, \"Taiyaki\" YESS!!"}
{"text":"I like visiting ethnic stores and being amused with authentic foods they carry. Fujiya Market is small grocery with Japanese foods and bright (tacky?) magazines. It has little Japanese community corner. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I always get my udon ingredients here. Fresh and in smaller portions. Vegetables are great prices, although limited options."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a decent Ramen spot in AZ since Umami closed a few months back unfortunately and Fujiya serves this purpose albeit only on Saturdays.  For $6 the broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  The hard boiled egg was tasty and had been marinated before hand.  Ramen is only served on Saturdays starting at 11:30 so get there early.  They only serve 30 bowls which is a shame, because it is one of the few serviceable ramen options in the state.  Seating is also limited as well."}
{"text":"- Updating my review for the ramen -

And wow is the ramen good! I wasn't expecting much but for the paltry sum of $6 (If my memory serves me correctly) I got a bowl of Miso Ramen served a slice of pork, ginger, seaweed, and an egg. Excellent rich broth, perfectly chewy noodles, all served up with the condiments listed above made it a pretty awesome dish. I also drank all the umami filled broth without shame. ^^ I'd say the ramen here is as good as Cherry Blossom's downtown at a much cheaper price

Even though it was pretty early on Saturday the parking lot was full and the ramen sold out 30 min after I got there with my friend. Though... early for me is 11:00 am lol. 

You won't regret waking up early for noodles!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to write about this place. It just became a habit to come here on the weekends (Saturday) for ramen and bentos.  You can't bet the ramen here! $6 and you get a delicious bowl of tonkotsu ramen, perfectly portioned with traditional toppings. We always try to get here around 45mins before they start serving (11:30pm now) and get our numbers so we don't have to watch everyone else get their bowls of ramen before us. To kill the time while we wait we have tried many of their snacks offered in their grocery aisles as well as their prepared stuff. My favorites are the salmon bentos, takoyakis, salmon/kelp onigiris and  unagi bowl. All of their food is very affordable the small bentos and bowls go for about $4 and the big bentos are $7. We always are on the look out for when the put out the  onigris ($1.20), because they go fast. Sometimes we order a bunch in advance to make sure we get the ones we want. Overall love coming to this place and definitely recommend anyone who wants to try some Japanese food besides sushi."}
{"text":"One of few Japanese grocery stores in AZ. Clean and well selected products. Variety of lunch boxes( freshly made) look so yummy. I chose the Tempura soba noodle. It was good but more soup would make it perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place! I try to make it on Saturdays for the Ramen before try run out. Best ramen I've had here in AZ so far. Love the different varieties of to go food options as well but they run out quick so get there early!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place when I was having a dinner party and wanted to serve sushi.  It's a great ethnic supermarket and is very reasonably priced.  They sell pretty much everything I need from serving pieces to beer.  They have a great Sake collection as you would imagine.  They also have an extensive selection of frozen foods and some other regional selections.

They also have a refrigerator section with fresh sushi, seaweed salad, etc.  

I recommend it for a quick lunch if you work or live in the area and also if you are an adventurous cook.  Fun!"}
{"text":"This grocery store never lets me down! I can always find what i need at a good price! :D Small but great shop! Theirs bentos are amazingly good! ?????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Definitely a big fan of this place. The bento box is a ton of food and comes out to just over $7.00 with a drink.  The sushi that comes with the meal seems very fresh and this place is hard core Japanese. Case in point, see how many times the guy behind the counter bows while you're talking to him.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love at first sight!  Fujiya has come to my rescue so many times!  If you ever go carb-free, they have these amazing yam noodles you can buy in the refrigerated section for less than $3.00.  They are not open on Monday's or most holidays, so watch out!  The sushi, when they have it is the BEST.  Ok, I am not exagerrating--The Best.  They wrap the rolls tight, and the sushi's only made in early afternoon.  What they make is all they put out, so you know it's fresh.  The fish balls (rice triangles with stuffing inside and seaweed outside) are so delicious I could live off of them, in tuna, salmon or plum stuffing.  They also have a pretty wide variety of teas (both in boxes and in the bottles in their refrigerated section.)  The candy aisle is also a blast.  I bring something new and exciting back to the office on every trip (i.e. chocolate mushrooms or hazelnut flavored tree stump-shaped candies.)  There are also movies to rent and little toys and trinkets for sale.  The service is also very friendly and professional.  They don't serve alcohol, but they do sell bottles of it.  You can't stay there and eat, but I would drive 50 miles for this sushi!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Saturday ramen alone. Every Saturday, they serve up a limited amount of ramen starting at 11:30AM. Apparently, the ramen varies and you can check online to see what they're serving up that particular Saturday, but I've noticed it's been tonkotsu ramen usually recently. Their tonkotsu ramen is quite delicious and it doesn't leave me feeling too guilty after eating, aka it does not feel heavy or fattening. And the price is super affordable. Definitely recommend trying...probably one of the more authentic ramen in AZ..."}
{"text":"Did you know that Japan is made up of 6,852 islands?

I haven't stopped into Fujiya Market in a few good years and when I popped in on Friday for some snacks, I was surprised.  This place looks so empty!  I remember when there use to be a wall full of beauty and hair products, shelves filled with alcohol, an impressive display of toys from Re-Ment and Poppin' Cookin', et cetera.  Now it seems like the shelves are barely being stocked.  Even the pre-made bentos and rice ball collection seems relatively smaller.

Regardless, this place still has a lot of goods for you to browse if you're in the area but for me, I think I'll stick with other international markets closer to Chandler."}
