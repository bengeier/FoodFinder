{"text":"Great comfy friendly bar with awesome food and good portions. Long Island ice teas best I've ever had. Your first visit will feel so comfy it's like you've been there many times before as the atmosphere and owner Susie/Kevin make you feel that way!"}
{"text":"After living in the area for nearly a decade, I finally found out what all the fuss was about at Elrama Tavern. This place is very cozy with a nice atmosphere. They have a well-stocked bar and excellent food choices.  This is definitely one of the best local places for food and drink."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food and decent beer selection. Comfy, relaxed atmosphere. The torpedo shrimp are so good!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Tavern now four times for lunch and had a different dish each time.  I have loved every single one and service has always been great.  It is definitely off the beaten path, but if you're in the area and in need of a place to eat, the Elrama Tavern is a winner.  Quick service, good quality, and great prices make it a real good place to go.  I've had their Quesadillas, Chicken sandwiches, BLTs, french fries, and Fried Bologna.  I highly recommend it during lunch for a quick bite since their kitchen is on point with getting you well prepared hot food in a jiffy before you have to go back to work.  There's also a Full Bar and outdoor seating area which we haven't tried out yet, but will definitely have to go back and give that a try as well."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Extensive menu with plenty of items for everyone in our family. We had the onion rings (delicious and hot), southwest quesadilla (great vegetarian option), chicken salad, and kids' meals (my kids had wedding soup and chicken fingers). Great food, great service, and great outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"great wait staff, nice deck; they have the best French Onion Soup around the county, I can't get enough of the Smothered chicken sandwich, everything on the menu is great and big servings."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  The food is great and the drinks are awesome.  I have never been disappointed.  They make the best Long Island Iced Teas and they are always on special on Saturday.  The staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go!  Great good and good prices!  Bar tenders and staff are super nice and friendly and it's a nice atmosphere.  It's kid friendly to!"}
{"text":"Cute little bar with a really nice deck good service and grew food we've become regulars its so good."}
{"text":"A great little bar with great food!  One of the best outside drinking decks around."}
{"text":"Nice little gem off the beaten path.    The Arnold Palmer was delicious.   Service was fantastic.  Had the gyro salad and the meat was good and crisp.  Tzatziki sauce was good, may have been homemade?  Not sure though.  I'll definitely stop back when back in the area.  Hopefully get the same server too, just sayin'."}
{"text":"The food was small town and big city perfectly mixed.  I went on prime rib night.  An excellent meal with excellent portions for a majorly reasonable price.  Prime rib was tender, juicy and cooked to perfection.  Side dishes were amazing.  Smashed potatoes were not heavy, but tasty.  I had the apple pie w/. ice c ream and caramel for dessert.  The pie crust was the tenderest, most mouthwatering, bunch of flaky goodness.  I will be going back and I will take about 10 friends.  OH, cannot skip mentioning the long island iced teas made from a secret home-made recipe.  The mixutre was spell-binging.  This is a big hidden secret in a small out-of-the way town.  Make your way there."}
{"text":"We eat at ET on Mondays for pizza night and Wednesday's for wings the food is one of the best around"}
{"text":"After what was supposed to be a picnic yesterday my boyfriend and I ended up here when there wasn't enough food and our dinner option quickly dwindled to chips or pretzels. He had the prime rib sandwich and finished it all saying it was really good. Mushrooms and onions came on it too. His sandwich came with fries and he had a 23 oz yuengling. I had a pick two option with French onion soup and half of a turkey Reuben. It was quite a big half but I was starving at finished it all. It was coleslaw,thousand island, Swiss, and turkey- the usual ingredients. The soup was delicious- not overly cheesy or salty. The meal hit the spot and was $19.00 total- granted I just had water but still dirt cheap for decent food in my opinion. This is near my boyfriends house so we will surely return in the future."}
{"text":"Love the Tavern! Great food, amazing drinks, great atmosphere and staff. They have this really nice back deck and the whole place is quaint and charming. The pizza is to die for, and they have this weird seafood quesadilla that is much much better than it sounds. The long islands are some of the best I've ever had, and are on special on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Took my mother out for her birthday andd found this place on here. Great bar atmosphere with nice seating outside of bar fireplace and all. They had long island iced tea on special, which were great! We decided on the wraps for dinner and got a pittsburgh one which was a steak one and a prime rib one. We split them to try both. Her fav was the pittsburgher and mine was prime rib . Both were excellent!!! When I go back her way will definitely go back! The politeness and attention from the wait staff was very good as well!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good food here but the only thing if you order a quesodilla they don't have guacamole which goes hand in hand with that in my opinion. They have good prices their long island iced teas are great!"}
{"text":"Non smoking, yay! Nice little bar with a nice selection of craft beers on draft,  which was a delightful surprise. A lot of menu choices, friendly staff, really good first impression. I'll definitely stop back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar and restaurant!  We frequent here with some friends pretty often. They have a nice menu - simple, yet very tasty food. Great salads, good burgers, and very good sandwiches. Full bar - good drinks, very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Excellent Beer Selection! They Really Know How To Make A Fantastic Caucasian! The Food Is Great, But It Is For Sure NOT Fast."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've dined here in the past couple of years. It was good last time, but it was great this time. I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with a handful of fries, while my business partner ordered the Reuben on marble rye.  The chicken sandwich came with banana peppers under the cheese and it made for a really tasty sandwich. Perhaps the best of its kind I've ever had. My partner's sandwich was top notch, but what really set it off for him was the marble rye. He's a huge fan, so that was a big bonus for him.  If you get lost, or maybe find yourself in the area down by the river (maybe living in a van!), check this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are here at least once a week...the food is amazing!!! I love coming on Sunday for their Bloody Mary special. The drink is served with a skewer of Cajun shrimp and made with real horseradish.... It is sooooo good! The long islands are also the best in town. My boyfriend loves the wings (they are WHOLE wings too) and I love the prime rib sandwich. We always get the fiesta poppers or calamari fries as an app. Nothing on the menu is bad and trust me, we have tried almost everything on it, we have been coming here so long :) they have live music too every weekend and an outdoor patio with fireplace. It's family friendly too, which is hard to find at most bar and grills around here. Def a nice laid back place to enjoy an awesome meal and great service!! My friends travel over an hour some weekends to join us here as they've become addicted as well :)"}
{"text":"Great small town spot! A lot of great options, even for vegetarians. Friendly staff and patrons. The fire place came in handy too!"}
{"text":"Who knew this place was a hidden little gem? Not us! Our friends introduced us to this spot this weekend and we really loved it! It's a cozy and cute bar. On a Friday night it was pretty busy so we couldn't find any seating inside, but they had an outside deck that had been closed up with heating lamps available so it wasn't freezing or anything for us. This worked fine. The menu had a huge selection and variety of food that was great. Prices were extremely cheap and reasonable. I ordered a Long Island iced tea which was huge and tasted great! I got the stuffed cheese pretzel as an app and all four of us thought it was delicious. For my meal I ordered a gyro and really enjoyed this too. As for dessert, I ordered the brownie. It was hard, but minus that, the flavor was fantastic. They also have a man who sings, and the music was honestly pretty loud, and his singing was honestly pretty bad lol, but it didn't bother us. We enjoyed our night here and will be returning and recommending for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for food. Big selection of sandwiches and munchies. Salads are available, too. Friendly staff and small town atmosphere are welcoming. Lauren was working when I stopped. She filled me in on the activities- bands on the weekend, occasional kickball games behind the building, specials on food, ( and provided excellent service.) Check out their online calendar for the list. Of activities and specials. Try their burgers. Some of the best I have ever eaten. I really think you will enjoy it."}
