{"text":"Their sandwiches and salads are good, but they don't have a lot of selections for juices in the morning. I wanted to try the green infusion or healthy sunrise juice, and I am told every time that they are not making it today. Not sure if they are ever going to make it, since I have been there for a week straight and was told that they don't make the drink today. The prices are fairly decent, especially for the food quality."}
{"text":"I get food from regularly at pinic as they have the best thai lemongrass soup. It is gluten amd dairy free."}
{"text":"This basically the same model as Pret a Manger in Britain, and it's been sorely missing in this market. They offer delicious healthy takeaway food for very reasonable prices, with lots of variety. If it were just a little closer to my office I'd eat lunch here every day!"}
{"text":"Went here this morning on my way to work. Noticed it had just opened yesterday, but already had my coffee by then. 

The staff were very welcoming and the venue was open and enticing. I had a chocolate smoothie and an espresso, both of which were great and reasonably priced as those items go in the area.  

The set up is novel. They have a large picnic table communal seating area which could be cool for hanging out. It's a great spread for reading a book or newspaper. 

All in all it seems like a great addition to the concourse."}
{"text":"My regular lunch spot it's honestly the best deal on Cumberland for the food you get. The heat and run pots are my go to daily protein meals; pulled pork or Turkey served on a bed of quinoa or rice with coleslaw for 5.85...whaaaaaaaat! Ya I'm here at least once or twice a week. It's in Cumberland terrace safe from the treacherous unpredictable weather of this city. Common eating area for quick and friendly conversations... A nice picnic break from the office."}
{"text":"A new, fresh looking food outlet just opened up in the underground Bloor St West concourse at roughly 60 Bloor St W. It is nearly directly across from the Druxy's/Second Cup area of the concourse. 

Anyway, they just opened up and offer up some healthy options which don't burn your wallet as much as the Holts cafe. They offer soup, sandwiches, drinks, smoothies, and coffee. The lunch items are pretty standard 'heatlhy' fare but the smoothies are interesting. A number of them have kale as an ingredient and some have protein powder as well. The smoothie menu actually reminds me of the Whole Foods juice bar for those who have been there.

The service is super attentive given their recent opening and there is a huge communal picnic table smack dab in the middle of the space. The place was buzzing around lunch hour and from what I can tell, they also have free instore wifi. Always a plus.

I only got a smoothie this time around but I'd definitely come back and try out some of the hot and cold options here."}
{"text":"Stumbled into the food court at the 5th Street Arcade and chose Picnic for lunch. Great choice. I had the Clevelander - nice sized grilled dog, coleslaw, french fries (not sure how I felt about that at first) and some great sauce. Bun was great - large enough to wrap around the generous portion although I needed a fork to finish everything that fell off while I bit off more than I could chew. Super tasty, quick service, friendly staff. Kudos on their creativity, quality and portions. I'll be back for a quick, satisfying bite again soon!"}
{"text":"The few times I ate at picnic I found the food to be decent. But then I had a sandwich and the bread was stale and the egg salad/lettuce seemed old and sad. 

A friend of mine recently went to eat here and apparently one of the people that works there told him that almost all the food from Picnic is made/assembled in China then flown over!!!! No wonder the bread is stale. Not sure if this is true- but I could believe it."}
{"text":"Concept looks great and looks inviting, but just had the Tuna and Wasabi Sandwich from the ready-to go station and the bread was hard! Almost stale.  I think it was left from yesterday because it wasn't fresh.  Took 1 bite and tossed it.

Too bad I wanted to like the place."}
{"text":"This used to be the greatest little place for breakfast and lunch. A destination that I would go out of my way to eat at. The sandwiches were fresh, ready to eat. The staff used to be friendly helpful and personable. 

I went to Picnic this morning to find out that they've discontinued some of the sandwiches. The ones that were there looked stale and tired. The fruit salad was not ready to eat - hard and flavorless fruit. The staff were disinterested at the cash... I had to ask for milk, a sleeve and then a lid. They even looked annoyed that there were people in line to cash out. 

I hope this place turns around. Brings back the amazing friendly staff, crack out the bread and make some new sandwiches."}
{"text":"Picnic is similar to the Pret a Manger style of store that you see in many European cities. There is a wall full of small, healthy, bite sized food options (i.e. green macha chia pudding, pomegranate and spinach salads). At the main counter you can order pasteries or something from the juice bar.

This is a welcome sight in the bleak, healthy food deficient underground of Toronto. It's ten steps up from the stale pizza, hard chicken, and sucpicious sushi from the food court down the hall.

For my visit, I mentioned to the person at the main counter that it was my first visit. He gave me a gluten free cookie to celebrate! 

Awesome place."}
{"text":"Picnic is a great place for lunch. The self serve format is user friendly and the staff is very helpful.
There is a good variety of  creative salads for which you may also choose your own dressing, everything is super fresh and gets replenished often. There are many sandwiches or half sandwiches for those with smaller appetites and a good variety of healthy vegetarian fare. I also tried the chocolate and lemon mousse for dessert, they were both excellent.. prices and quality are great in comparison to all the other eateries in the neighborhood. I work in the area occasionally and make it a point to have my lunch here every time."}
{"text":"You will find me here at least a couple times a week!

I LOVE picnic.

Why? It's healthy, delicious, quick, easy and a great price. I almost always get one of their delicious fresh salads.

They also have a cool reward program that earns you free food and a nice big picnic bench for eating your food, though most people take it to go.

Keep your eyes out, I imagine there will be more Picnic locations popping up around the city in the years to come, this business is definitely here to stay."}
{"text":"I ordered a large soy chai latte and got a cup of foam with little soy chai latte. I wish businesses train their baristas before letting them serve customers. Now I see why there was no one here in the morning. They should consider taking coffee/tea off their menu unless they make their staff get some decent training.  Anyone can push a button and stick a cup of milk under a frother. Won't be coming back here in the morning for my caffeine fixes. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Working downtown and always being on the go, i don't have the patience to wait in line to get food, especially healthy food.

my coworker told me about this place and I decided to try it, and was pleasantly content.

I got a half tuna sandwich and a taco salad, with taxes came to $10.85, not bad at all for a good balance.

so I'm usually hesitant to eat cold sandwiches because they don't taste good (like the ones they have at Longo's) however, I was very happy with my lunch. it tasted fresh and wasn't overly cold. 

I like how with the purchase of a salad you have the option to get one of the dressing of your choice available, and you determine how much or how little dressing you want to add. Again, the ground turkey that was in my salad wasn't overly cold, I really enjoyed my salad too. 

I don't know how busy they get at lunch time but I went at 11:40ish and I was out in less than 5 minutes. 

Definitely will return to try other food here."}
{"text":"Picnic is one of newest restaurants in the 5th street arcade. Overall the food is delicious and priced very affordably.  This is a hot dog and sausage joint. Although they do also sell a burger which I have yet to try. The main menu mostly focused around hot dogs and sausages. I have yet to try them all but everything I have tried so far has been absolutely delicious. Prices range from $4.00 up to $8.00 and they have a very long list of toppings to choose from with all of your traditional hot dog toppings and some others that are a little unconventional such as peanut butter.  Most of the toppings are included in the price with just a handful of deluxe toppings such homemade chili, homemade coleslaw and fresh cut fries which are only a slight up charge. Unlike a lot of the businesses in the arcade that will only accept cash or charge a fee for using a credit card. They accept all forms of payment with no extra fees or hassle. When I asked the nice lady at the counter if they accept credit cards she smiled and said \"we happily accept all forms of payment! \" The staff is great with fast friendly service! I recommend either the \"Chicago Dog\" or the \"Clevelander\" which is a Polish sausage topped with French fries, coleslaw and BBQ sauce!! Very nice filling portions, and all hot dogs come with their delicious house made chips! \"Picnic\" is quickly becoming one of my favorite go-to places for a tasty quick and affordable lunch!"}
{"text":"I once had a bad experience at picnic many years ago and swore to never come back. 
Things changed. 
I was craving a smoothie one afternoon and decided to give them a second chance. I'm so glad I did. Picnic has great food and is reasonably priced. It's a great place for those budget conscious, healthy eaters. 

You must try:
- the survival cookie (you won't regret it)
- mixed master or green tea matcha smoothie (solid)
- their columbian coffee, it's surprisingly good! (And 50 cents on fridays!)"}
{"text":"I emailed Picnic to explain my dismay and the woman said that I would receive a $15 credit. I emailed her to ask how I would receive this credit, and got no response -- which to be honest made me feel awkward about going and asking about it. So now that I am moving out of the city I decided to cash in my $15 credit. I printed my correspondence and took it with me. 

There was no record of my credit and therefore I was happy that I brought the email with me. I got the wakey wakey ( without banana) and the lemon juice with cayenne. The guy at the cash listened to my story and then wrote $15 on a business card and told me to come back another day. I told him nope, I'm never coming back and so he rang up my order and said it was fine. 

I think the intention was good for the credit and making amends, but again a lot of hassle. I would say this time around my drink was delicious, but those two drinks came up to $14.51. It's a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"If you are in the Bloor-Yorkville area and in a rush then Picnic is a fine fast food option. Toronto is finally adopting the Pret a Manger model! This branding is a bit more playful though.

Some people are saying that Picnic is overpriced but I don't think this point is totally fair; and I'm not just saying this given the area and the well-heeled crowd that it serves.

For example, I had a chickpea and quinoa salad with cucumbers, feta, herbs and dressing for $5.25. The volume was adequate to stave off hunger and the taste and quality was fresh."}
{"text":"Picnic is different from anything found in the concourse. It is the antithesis of the Druxy's Deli sitting right across from it, or the bacteria-laden tables of Holt's Cafe. So in that regard, it wins! 

The set up is quite communal, which seems cool/innovative/trendy/ makes me reminisce of Stockholm--but I'm not quite sure if I actually like it. The lack of seating  really narrows it to a grab-and-go kind of place for me. Which is fine--who's got time?

Pros:
-The freshly squeezed selection of juices every morning
-healthy salads
-ready to go sandwiches
-Smoothies (delicious, especially the espresso wake one, and the fact they contain kale, almond butter and almond milk). The mixed is also a favourite I heard.
-Coffee/latte/capuccinos etc.
-Friendly/enthusiastic service

Con:
Selection of protein powders. If i'm paying $6+ for a smoothie, I don't want classic vanilla whey powder???

Update: They apparently got a hemp powder now. Vegans rejoice."}
{"text":"One of my go-tos for lunch and sometimes, even breakfast.  I was, at first, not too happy with their choices as they lacked pescetarian/vegetarian-friendly options (I only eat \"land meat\" at dinner), but am glad to see more choices now.  One of my favourites is the apple and brie baguette as well as falafel salad (if I feel like something fried).  They also have almond milk, which Starbucks still doesn't have!  I'm not a fan of their fruit/granola cups with yogurt as it's a flavoured!  The fruit is sweet enough that one doesn't need any additional sweetener!"}
{"text":"This place started off well, and the food is good but service is starting to go down hill compared to when it opened. It's hit and miss whether you get your rewards points and starting to get attitude when you ask for a bag. I hope they straighten this out."}
{"text":"Good coffee love the breakfast wraps but just too expensive. Its a great breakfast treat"}
{"text":"Two Words:  PARTY SANDWICHES!  

I had a sandwich that was half egg / half tuna.  This makes me very happy.  I had a salad as well, which was pretty good except that the chicken on top was so dry as to be almost inedible, and it was on the expensive side for what was in it.  But ... PARTY SANDWICHES!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for healthy food and I didn't feel like standing in a long line at Salad Days, Salad House or Xtreme taste and I think Freshii is a rip off.

So I came here based on Amanda M's review.  

What I liked:
-Underground
-Nice clean communal table
-They have 1/2 sandwiches for under $3 so you don't need to eat an entire sandwich
-It's somewhat reasonable price (got a 1/2 sandwich and soup for $6.71 incl. tax)
-The chicken tortilla soup was quite good.  It had a bit of kick to it. 
-They are like a coffee shop, soup, salad and sandwich place in one. 

What I disliked:
-It's not as cheap as Salad House or Salad Days 
-The spicy chicken sandwich (1/2) wasn't spicy as all and I thought it was a bit small for a 1/2 sandwich.  

Overall, I think this is a solid \"feel good\" type of place that's cheaper than Freshii and healthier than Panera.  Not a bad bet.  Just don't expect huge portions."}
{"text":"ok so since my last review ive come back to picnic frequently and the food has gotten fresher and salads are better.  the soups are on point the last few times ive gotten them so i am happy to update my review with a better grade.  there also seems to be a bit more variety.  im happy there is healtby and clean and simple food avalible this is what makes this place special in comparison to an unhealthy saturated fastfood industry that surrounds us constantly to make unhealthy choices."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst fast food experiences I've had (worse than McDonald's). I came here after reading a blogTO article on it, thinking it was healthy but boy I was completely wrong about that.  Just because a place sells fruit cups and salads does NOT make it a healthy place. 

I ordered the pulled pork bowl and the dumpling bowl with quinoa. Quinoa, they said. Healthy, they implied. Not at all. The dumpling bowl had 3 layers of oil on the top and the pulled pork bowl was just as oily. I felt super uncomfortable after eating here and would not come back again."}
{"text":"Another update.  I have been eating the Thai Lemongrass soup 2-3x a week for the last year+.  I love it so much.  Just last week they changed the recipe, and it is NOT GOOD.  It no longer contains real chicken - instead it contains chicken scraps.  The soup is now thick and it tastes like yellow curry.  It's a big ol' mess.  I'm really disappointed and now have no use for this place.  Their other offerings are not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Decent place for grab-and-go food. 

Picnic's thai lemongrass soup is a favourite amongst my coworkers. Their chia seed dessert pudding is comparable to Belmonte Raw for a fraction of the price. 

Note: Picnic turns off their frozen dessert machine at 5:30pm. Come before then if you want to try their frozen greek yogurt dessert! I like to add chocolate drizzle to mine :)"}
{"text":"Appears like a work in progress.. clean interior.
Latte was average.  Music too loud, barista couldn't be heard over it.
Will return, not many juice options nearby."}
{"text":"I needed something quick to eat on my way to the subway, and I had never tried anything from Picnic (though I'd walked by it countless times), so I figured I'd pop in and grab a sandwich.

I eventually decided to go with their Spicy Chicken sandwich (\"12 Grain Bread, Spicy Chicken Mix, Sriracha Aioli, Romaine Lettuce, and Sundried Tomatoes\").

It's fine, I guess. It was competently assembled and the bread tasted reasonably fresh, but it pretty much had mediocre written all over it. The big problem here is the lack of flavor: it didn't really taste like anything. Really, the most predominant flavor here was the bread, followed closely by the Romaine. The Spicy Chicken filling was so bland that it didn't really make any kind of an impression.

And for almost $9, I honestly didn't feel like I was getting a whole lot of bang for my buck."}
{"text":"Just ate here today for the first time.  Was excited to try it out as it's always nice to find a new lunch place for when I fancy buying my lunch.  I spent just under $15 on two hot items.  The mac and cheese (which I thought I might have with salad for dinner) and a falafel wrap (to eat for lunch).  Long story short, I won't be back to Picnic although if budget is your top concern then it might be worth trying again in order to locate a couple of worthwhile items.  The staff were friendly when I checked out which was nice but it was no substitute for blah food.  The falafel wrap was small, had a couple of thin slices of pepper and some spinach leaves but was totally dry.  The wrap had that microwave taste (with one crispy end from being kept warm I imagine) and the mac and cheese was mushy (overcooked pasta), low on cheese flavour and high on garlic seasoning.  If either item had been good I would have overlooked the weaker item and given the place the benefit of the doubt.  As it is I'll skip it and maybe go with some pricier but tastier options that are available nearby."}
{"text":"I tried the coffee at Picnic and it wasn't half bad! Originally dropped by to pick up some breakfast but nothing appealed to me so I just got coffee. Rating stays the same.

I don't know what it is about this location... it just feels super cold and sterile. I'd prefer to pick up food from the Longo's across the hall than wander further into the store here."}
{"text":"I purchased a large Chicken Noodle Soup for $5.05 taxes in. There was absolutely no filling in this soup. There were a couple of noodles (5 at most), and 1 small chunk of chicken. The soup was all broth and although it was not super oily, it was still too oily for my liking. Very disappointing for the price paid. I also wanted to purchase a sandwich, but decided against it as the bread looked very soggy."}
{"text":"I work near here and it's my favourite spot to grab a pre-made salad. The best is the salmon one in my opinion and you can try different dressings each time! They sell full and half sandwiches too and tons of snack options."}
{"text":"Price/value balance is not good. No ambience just a grab and go place but prices are almost like a restaurant.3 medium- small size salmon and some green salad as a side cost 53$. You woud expect lower prices when you sit on a bar chair and try to finish your food as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I love this place! Picnic reminds me of the grab and go culture I saw in London England, with quality food and variety to go. Simply delicious and healthy! Surprisingly good coffee too! 
There were lots of great vegetarian and vegan options. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. Great location!"}
{"text":"Convenient and healthy lunch options! When  I want to pick up something quick, this a great spot. Lots of vegetarian options and delicious falafel salad!"}
{"text":"They are delicious. Only thing stopping me from returning often is that it's quite pricey. Understanding doable since they're located in a pretty ritzy area. Ryan O smoothie is delicious and their salmon salad. Definitely a healthy treat once in awhile!"}
{"text":"I have walked past this place for the last month and always wanted to check it out. I was excited when my friend asked the other day to go there for lunch. I was pleased at the concept of pure healthy eating. Everything on the menu is good for you which is an excellent change from all this fast food stuff I have been surrounded with my entire life. 

I ordered the quinoa with Mexican chicken on top. I was a little disappointed at the size but I guess they also go for portion control to. I think size options would benefit in a situation like this. Also what we ordered wasn't on the menu and what was on the menu was available. From a customers stand point I found that very confusing. I also felt this place was over priced, but then again any restaurant u go to over price the healthy food and under price the heart attacks in a box.

Cool concept non the less."}
{"text":"I walked in here not knowing what to expect. I walked out with two bottles of fresh-squeezed juice and a couple of half-sandwiches. 

I'm definitely a fan and will be coming here whenever I'm in the area and feel like a light awesome sandwich and a yummy bottle of juice!"}
{"text":"First visit at a busy lunchtime and everything was great.  Had a brat and poutine, both done perfectly.  Bit slow, but they make it fresh and worth the wait.  Will definitely stop by here again when I'm in the area, try it!

2nd visit - was there when they were to open at 11AM, not open.  Finally someone walked in and I asked when do you open and they said soon...10 min go by, now 11:15, don't have time to wait for my lunch time, went elsewhere.  Not friendly, didn't seem to care.  If you are only open a few hours a day, BE OPEN for that time, not sorta...."}
{"text":"Im lucky to have this location in my office building.  I love the survival cookies.  They are dense enough to keep you full and satisfied"}
