{"text":"Food is very good and different from anything close to Waxhaw.  Everything has been been good. So far and have gone at least 5 times. The Old Cotton Mill is put to good use and you can see the old brick and wood throughout.    It can get very busy at times which leads to food and service delays so be patience is a virtue on Friday/Saturday nights.  Kerri is awesome behind the bar and quick to to get you a drink or menu.    Just be mindful of where you park and walk. The mill is mostly residential and have numbered parking spaces on sides of the Mill which are owned by the residents.   The fire pits and outdoor grills are inviting but are residents only. So be respectful of course.    Enjoy Emmet's and Waxhaw.  It's a good place to be."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Easter Sunday and found this new place in Waxhaw to have some AMAZING Tapas food. I have lived in this area 4 years and this is the best food I've had yet. The Korean Chicken wings are to die for and the fried deviled eggs are scrumptious! This is definitely going to be a hit in the Waxhaw area. Service was great and loved how they kept the old time feel of the mill. Will definitely be a regular here. Simply Delicious food!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time tonight. The food and service was excellent! (Thanks Eric)! We had the fried green tomatoes, brussel sprouts, and German sliders. We thought they were all very tasty. We finished with the peach cobbler and the oh snap desserts. Normally we don't have room for dessert but the tapas let us enjoy a little more. We paired all this with a Waxhaw mule and a draft Stella. We were very pleased and will be back. The outdoor seating area seemed very nice but we chose to be seated inside. It has a nice, rustic feel. I would like to see a little bit more decor on the walls but it gives the feel of an old mill (which is the point). We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was a good experience, our server Jonathan, was great and engaging.  He had really good suggestions.  The food was okay...I would like to see them put other items on their menu.  The avocado tuna is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the Tappas style dining! Great atmosphere & folks who work there. We got one so-so meal late one night but I believe that was a fluke. Would not recommend  the veggie flatbread but the shrimp & grits are to die for! Love that Eric at the bar!"}
{"text":"0/10 I was treated horribly and the staff acted like I was stupid. I will never come here again and have never felt so disrespected."}
{"text":"What a cool place. They kept many of the historic and original elements when renovating, and repurposed them. I recommend the outside dining area, but time it right regarding direct sun as there isn't a ton of shade. Food is good (tapas style), and it is kid friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. Great food, atmosphere, service. Nothing else like this in south Charlotte that I know of.  I highly recommend Emmet's Social Table! Loved everything we ate: chicken n waffles, pork belly tacos, pulled pork mac n cheese, fried green tomatoes, and shoestring fries. All that and a beer for $50 and left there full and happy!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was good. A nice variety of different styles of food. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! Outdoor fire creates an amazing ambiance. When a drink surrounded by friends is what you need get to Emmets and have any one of their specialty drinks followed by the totally delicious chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I love eating in repurposed spaces. The history of the mill combined with how they restored it makes Emmets such a fun place. After a long work week, this is a great place to reset and unwind. It is a Tapas style eatery, meaning smaller plates that are shareable. Put your cell phone away as we noticed most people engaged in conversation with each other rather than with their cell phone.  We ordered 9 different plates.  My only request would be for them to make savory only dishes like a creative Bruschetta board. In every dish we ordered it had a sweet undertone which I loved but after the 5th dish it left us wanting something without sweet, sweet relish, sweet mango, even the philly cheese steak tacos tasted sweet.   Their wine and cocktails were amazing and beautiful in presentation.  My 2 cents go there with the mindset that the plates are small portions. Eat a big lunch so come dinner you truly enjoy the lighter meal."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a tapas restaurant in Waxhaw so my two teenagers and I gave it a try on a Tuesday night. We ordered BLT Sliders ($10), Flight of Dips ($9), Tomato Soup Shooter ($8) and the Mediterranean Bowl ($10) with salmon ($6).   The blt sliders came out first, and they were very good. The dip trio came out second, and this is where things went downhill. The hummus was good enough, but the french onion and Tzatziki were just ok. We ordered ours with veggies (and skipped doing the combo veggies and pita for a $2 upcharge), but the amount of dip FAR outlasted the veggies (4 each of carrot and celery sticks). The waitress offered us additional veggies, but we declined since it was an additional $2 charge - a bunch of celery is only $0.99 at the grocery store!! To her credit, she said she \"always feels bad there's so much dip left\" that she offered to box it up so we could take home the leftovers.   My kids shared the tomato soup shooters, which were fabulous, and then we waited on the final item - the Mediterranean bowl with salmon. The bowl first came out sans salmon, and when I asked about it was told that it was burned, being remade and would be out it in 10 minutes. I handed the bowl back to waitress so that food would be a consistent temp when the salmon was finally done, and she seemed surprised. Multiple folks acted like it was a huge favor to remake the bowl to be served with salmon at the same time, which surprised me. With everything else eaten, we waited more than 10 minutes. Once it arrived, I wish I could say it was worth the wait, but sadly the olives had pits, the cucumber was mushy and the salmon was over-cooked. I added a bit of the Tzatziki sauce for a bit of flavor but overall, it was disappointing.  Given the that the prices are high and the portions low, the multiple $2 upcharges for basic items and the kitchen performance for our food, we'll not be back for any sort of meal. Seems like it could be a nice spot for drinks with a decent selection of wine and craft cocktails, but it was not a dining destination based on our experience."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday at 6:30.  We were seated easily and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The staff was friendly albeit,  a tad unorganized. Food was delicious,  go for the Poke Avocado!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Staff is extremely attentive and friendly.  The food is amazing.  We had the Poke-stuffed Avocado, Kickin Chicken & Waffles and the Salmon Brochettes.  All three were outstanding. The chicken and waffles had a bit of a kick - FANTASTIC!!!!  I can't wait to come back and try more.  The cocktails all had a cool twist. Next time need to leave room for the Aw Snaps dessert."}
{"text":"It is great having another resturant in Waxhaw to enjoy. The food is good and no cork charge. Nice  indoor and outdoor dinning."}
{"text":"We made a spur the moment decision to try out this restaurant on the way from church one Sunday recently... Knew very little about it except that it was a popular place that was not open for lunch... I found out that the week before when I wanted to have lunch in town. We loved the menu we loved the food and small plates that allowed sharing... The food is addicting... It cannot be healthy and taste as good as it did. lol. It was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles for the first time... I've been thinking about ordering it for like seven years. And Will had the Philly tacos which sounded horrible to me BUT I kept asking for a bites because it was so yummy. We also got an order of those crazy fries with the three dipping sauces... I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I heard all good things about Emmits and couldn't wait to go. The food was delicious!!!!! Fun to try all different tapas and for small plates they do give you a lot of food! The atmosphere was fun and the service was good! Good wine too!!!! So happy to have Emmits in waxhaw!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there with hubby on Saturday to check things out since we've never been there.  We sat at the bar and the bartender's were super friendly and attentive!  I have to say that I think that bar may be set up well for the people sitting at it but the bartenders have to do aerobics to reach across to folks.  Poor design for the bartenders!   Atmosphere is very warm and welcoming and the patio area looked great even though we didn't go out there.  There was one couple waiting and we were told it would be 30 minutes for us to sit down.  Pretty strange when we saw plenty of empty tables once we sat at the bar.    Food was really mediocre and portions are VERY small for the price so don't expect too much.  Flavoring seemed lacking on several items.  Figgy flatbread was lacking a punch.  I expected real figs and I believe it had spots of fig jam.  Small amounts of the ingredients on the bread.  German beef sliders were overcooked and dry.  Mustard was overwhelming to the point where you couldn't taste the beef.  There was cheese in it?  Korean glazed wingers were the 5-star item...very tasty (3 full wings) and messy.  Caprese avocado salad had great ingredients but needed more balsamic and a touch of salt.  Emmet's smoked mac was highly recommended but ran out in the kitchen.  Why does an item on a limited menu run out at 7pm on a Saturday???  Pork belly taco's were a crap shoot, hubby loved the meat and I had a tough piece with a lot of fat.  The tortilla should have been toasted as well.    Tried the peach cobbler and I have to agree with other feedback I read.  It really tasted more like bread pudding and it didn't even taste like peaches.  I ate the ice cream and left half of the \"cobbler\".    As others have stated the prices add up and you don't get much to eat.  3 drinks, 5 tapas choices and two desserts were $100 plus tip.  Not sure we'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Food was really good although service was slow and the kitchen seemed backed up. We ordered two appetizers and didn't get the second one until we had been done with the first for a good 5-10 minutes. Then our main courses took a long time too, so we made sure to put in a dessert order before we were finished with dinner. I'm sure they're just ironing things out and it will improve with time. The Brussels sprouts were sooo good, but they were served whole so they were hard to eat. They would've been so much better if they had just been halved or quartered. We weren't fans of the peach cobbler.. looked and tasted too much like bread pudding. Everything else was delicious! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nasty, and unprofessional hostesses this evening.  I did not have this the first time I visited, however this time I was disappointed with the unprofessionalism.  Customer service is key!! The girls at the desk(hostesses) could take some lessons, and training in customer service.  A smile, and a positive attitude goes a long way!  A successful business always practices \"Customers first!!\"  You could tell that they are lacking in experience, and are not \"seasoned\" in dealing with the public, and customers!     I had such a positive experience the first time I was here.  Rather disappointed this time.  Food, and Drink was great, however the girls at the front desk were rude. 5/11/2018 about 9:30 p.m."}
{"text":"I was in Waxhaw and wanted to try something new. I was told about Emmet's a few days earlier. So we went and checked it out. When we arrived I was impressed by the way the bar and dinning area looked. Exposed bricks and pub style layout. We sat at the bar. The bar tenders seamed more interested in cutting Lemmons and setting up the bar. The draft list is very limited. I ordered a local draft. My wife ordered the retro Cosmo . Her drink was extremely sweet. She sent it back and ordered a vodka tonic. We ordered the dip sampler . The taziki dip had no taste. We then ordered the chicken and waffles . The chicken was bland and there was hardly sauce on chicken or the waffles. In a nutshell I'm more impressed by the decor then the food and service. I hope they step up their game. I will give them another shot in the near future."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Drove 20 minutes to get there after a friend's recommendation. We we told it would be a 45 minute wait even though there were empty tables and only one other couple waiting. Either poorly staffed or poorly managed."}
{"text":"A great addition to Waxhaw. Wish they had a bigger menu because we are pretty picky but every item we ordered was great! Drinks were also wonderful. The ambiance was so fun with the outdoor firepit. Staff was super friendly and welcoming. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! We had a private room for a ladies night out and Emmet's impressed us all! Favorites included their amazing Fried Green Tomatoes and the Waxhaw Mule . We expected smaller portions but left completely stuffed ! What a gem"}
{"text":"Yum! Great lunch-clean, efficient waitstaff, large parking lot. Cool old mill converted to a restaurant!  All the offerings are tapas and a few larger portions like the wedge salad and the salmon.   The three of us split; -the fried green tomato's-Devine.  -german pretzel sliders-good w/grilled onions -avocado/poke-good but a little hard to eat -salmon/rice-good with crispy skin -green tacos interesting but only two  Pork-belly/peach wraps-good flavor  But by far the best dish was the pimento cheese sandwich dippers with rich tomato soup. The presentation is beautiful with the sandwich dippers cut in quarters and 4 small silver demitasse mugs with the soup.   Casual dress,fun outdoor patio, full bar."}
{"text":"Went here the other night. Noticed that a lot of the food was heavily salted especially the arugula salad and the fish tacos. Our waitress also seemed to not know the menu and we had to ask her to repeat what we ordered back to us more than once in which case she misunderstood what we ordered. She also proceeded to tell us about a rash her granddaughter had contracted. Sorry but hearing about an unidentifiable rash on your granddaughter while I'm eating dinner is a turn off."}
{"text":"Great decor and beautifully located in the heart of Waxhaw but way too pricey. They have \"small plates\" for dinner prices."}
