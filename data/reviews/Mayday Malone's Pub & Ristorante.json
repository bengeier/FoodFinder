{"text":"Servers are rude and alcoholics. My server was drunk and could barely form words. Would constantly forget our orders. Insulted us and was rude to us. He cursed us for not taking shots with him. And when I refused to hug him he followed me out the bar asking me what he did wrong. For a moment I considered calling the police to get him off my back. He was way too drunk and was saying racial slurs. Not a place you should ever go to or even consider."}
{"text":"This Canadian-Italian pub is one of the few places to eat and drink along this stretch of Bathurst. Since it is close to the year-round ice rink, the Bolton Rink, at nearby Vermont Square, there are lots of late night hockey teams either drowning their sorrows, or celebrating their victories.  It is a sports bar, with lots of televisions, and two very large screen projectors. The beer is mostly of the Molson's varity, though there are a few craft-brewed beers from Millstreet and Steam Whistle.  During televised hockey and football games, this place can get packed (around 100 people). It is a bit \"grimy\" but that is part of its charm.  Their specialty food is the wide selection of pizzas. I usually have their equivalent of a \"meat-lovers\" pizza, and often there are specials with a pizza and pint. Their pasta is very good, and  is almost as good as the pizza.  The staff is almost always cheerful and friendly, though, due to the amount of patrons, can be a bit understandably slow. Overall, this is my go-to-bar in the Seaton Village area."}
{"text":"Nothing says Canadiana in my mind quite like a bar named after a fictional U.S. baseball player showing American Football on all of its televisions.  But those things aside, this bar had local Toronto charm all over it.  Visiting it on a Saturday night, the place was nearly deserted (surprising with its location on Bathurst Street), but there was still a buzz about it with a mixture of gnarled regulars sitting at the bar and families feasting on moderately-priced pizza and swapping stories in the restaurant area underneath well-used dartboards.  I feel like this place is better as a bar that a restaurant though.  I partook in simple noodles and pesto sauce while I was there.  For a place that is supposedly half Italian restaurant, the pasta wasn't even decent for bar food.  It was salty and the pesto was surprisingly spicy instead of zesty, but at half price on Saturdays, it was filling enough.  And to even have a bar with food specials on Saturday must prove the stereotype that Canadians are just nicer.  Had I been washing it down with one of their decently priced ($5-6) beers, I'm sure it would have tasted better.  I saw that they have karaoke so I'm sure that it's not as empty as it was when I was there every night.  The place looks like it holds a couple of hundred for major events.  And this seems like the kind of place that can get a bit out of hand during Maple Leafs season, but in the best way possible.  After all, a good, loud sports argument with a drunken neighbor knows no national boundaries."}
{"text":"As a pilot in training I thought I should go to a bar named \"Mayday\", it wasn't the only reason we walked in here, it was the closest pub to a friend's place which really was the only reason we came in for a quick drink around 11pm on a Friday or Saturday night. It didn't look like much from outside, perhaps a teeny bit sketchy with 4 or 5 tough looking guys smoking outside. It's weirdly spacious on the inside as well, it looks like it can hold a standing crowd, except there really was not a lot of people in here.  You won't be at a lost for TV screens to catch a sporting event and service here was quick and courteous, unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of their beer selection and both pitchers we ordered came in very flat (the beer was just really flat and seemed to try to make up for it by giving you a brain freeze after every sip).   Since I have a couple of friends that live in close proximity to here I could see myself come here again on the rare occasion, but I certainly won't be going out of my way to make another visit to Mayday's, But since there are quite a few 3 and 4 star reviews maybe I just came in on the wrong night."}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in the neighbourhood and have been coming here for years..The bartender, Ian, is one of the friendliest bartenders around and the karaoke on Fridays has the best karaoke song selection I have ever seen!i Wednesdays are half price pizza day and the pizza here is out of this world!! They make their own dough, pizza sauce..the whole nine yards and you can tell the difference. Real Italians work here!! Anyways, great divey sports bar to stop in for a pint or two and try any one of the 10 or 15 pizzas on offer and you will not be disapponted. THe North Ender is a personal fave."}
{"text":"God bless the independent pub.  There's nothing franchised about them and they're given the opportunity to sum up the neighbourhood as they see fit.  This place obviously took a look at their surroundings and said, \"This place needs an underbelly.\"  Found south of Dupont on Bathurst, Mayday Malone's is a sports bar that has a nice seedy quality to it.  I enjoy a nice dive bar once in a while and this place suits nicely.  It's the type of place where you peruse the menu and go, \"So...what is guaranteed to be deep fried?\"  Chicken fingers, it is.  There is a definitely local feel to it, and you get the sense that everyone in the place knows each other.  Probably because they do.  I've been with friends of mine in the hood a few times for soccer games and the place was pretty full for mid-afternoon on a work day, engaging a healthy mix of soccer fans and the unemployed.  Many of them the same people.  This is definitely not a high-falootin' place and is a nice little divey sports bar that I feel comfortable in whenever I go in.  Besides, anyone that takes their name from a \"Cheers\" reference can't be that bad.  By the way, the bar looks nothing like the one in Boston.  Don't bother asking."}
{"text":"Half price pizza night on Wednesdays is when we go. Handy as we live in area. Very good pizza and service . Like the  Roberto Alomar pizza .He goes there and is friends with owner. Sarah the server is excellent."}
{"text":"Mayday Malone's is a neighbourhoodly bar on Bathurst, just below Dupont.  I stopped by for lunch last week and ordered a Spicy Italian Sausage Sandwich w/ Greek Salad ($8.99).  It was sizable and filling, but was nothing worth raving about.  I'm not sure how the post-work / happy hour atmosphere here is, so can't comment on it."}
{"text":"I wonder if places like MM will breathe a sigh of relief when the hipster dive-bar fad ends and they can avoid confused would-be patrons' exclamations of \"Oh. . . this is an ACTUAL dive bar\" \"Yeah, totes, they're playing The Tragically Hip\".    In any case, my squeeze and I headed in here on a cycling jaunt around Dupont and immediately liked this unassuming neighbourhood pub.  There's nothing outstanding about it outside of its genuinely local feel--you can watch the game, play darts, etc.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the Dukeses and Firkinses of the Toronto pubscape."}
